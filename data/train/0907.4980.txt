    "an open question in early stellar evolution and planet formation is the process and timescale by which stars disperse their protoplanetary disks .",
    "central to this question is the lifetime of the gas component of circumstellar disks .",
    "the gas dominates the disk mass , but since small dust grains dominate the infrared opacity , dispersal or growth of these grains can significantly reduce or eliminate the excess infrared emission that is often taken to be the primary signature of a circumstellar disk , even if substantial gas is still present .",
    "related to the question of gas disk survival and evolution is the influence of x - ray emission on the circumstellar gas , and vice versa .",
    "t tauri stars , low - mass pre  main - sequence stars , are often strong x - ray emitters .",
    "a detailed understanding of the x - ray emission from these young stars is important both for an understanding of the early evolution of the stars themselves , and due to the x - rays impact on the surrounding environment .",
    "t tauri stars are often surrounded by disks of gas and dust , from which planets presumably form later in the pre  main - sequence phase .",
    "the physical state of these disks is strongly influenced by the star s x - ray emission .",
    "the x - rays are the dominant source of ionization of the disk @xcite , they strongly influence the disk chemistry @xcite , and they can be important in disk photoevaporation @xcite .",
    "x - ray flares from the young sun may have produced the isotopic anomalies seen today in meteorites @xcite .    similarly , the presence of circumstellar gas may play a role in shaping or modifying the star s x - ray emission .",
    "the model for the x - ray emission of the vast majority of t tauri stars is that the x - rays are produced by solar - type magnetic activity scaled up by rapid rotation and/or longer convective turnover times ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in a small number of systems",
    ", there is also evidence that the x - rays are influenced by interaction between a stellar magnetic field and a circumstellar disk , perhaps via accretion @xcite .",
    "the unprecedented x - ray spectral resolution and sensitivity of the _ chandra _ x - ray satellite offers an opportunity to place much better constraints on the temperature and density of the x - ray emitting gas , thereby providing potentially important information about the x - ray emission mechanism(s ) , and about the x - ray radiation field incident on the circumstellar disk .    to date",
    ", however , only a modest number of high - spectral - resolution x - ray observations of pre  main - sequence stars have been published ; even the distances to the nearest star - forming regions result in x - ray fluxes that make high - resolution observations prohibitively long .",
    "there are a handful of notable exceptions , however .",
    "tw hya @xcite and hd 98800 @xcite both lie in the nearby tw hya association , with a distance of roughly 50 pc and an age of 515 myr ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "chandra _ x - ray spectrum of tw hya yielded a surprisingly low temperature for the x - ray emitting gas , and suggestions of very high densities in the x - ray emitting regions , leading @xcite to suggest that the x - ray emission is related to accretion from the star s circumstellar disk .",
    "@xcite reached a similar conclusion based on density diagnostics in tw hya s _ xmm - newton _ spectrum , and also attributed the low fe abundance seen in the x - ray emitting gas to depletion of some elements from the gas phase onto dust grains in the disk .",
    "@xcite presented similar evidence for high - density x - ray emitting gas around the classical t tauri star bp tau .",
    "in contrast , the x - ray spectra of both hd 98800 @xcite and the similarly - aged ( @xmath7 myr ) pz tel @xcite are quite similar to spectra of older solar - type stars and show no evidence for unusually high densities , suggesting that their x - ray activity is , to first order , scaled - up solar activity .",
    "solar - like x - ray activity is also seen in ab dor @xcite , which is near or recently arrived on the zero - age main sequence .",
    "notably , tw hya and bp tau show clear evidence of active accretion from their circumstellar disks , while the stars with more solar - like x - ray emission do not have disks . in general ,",
    "while accretion may modify the x - ray spectrum in some young stars , studies of the x - ray emission from large samples of young stars show that accretion is not a primary driver of x - ray activity @xcite .    in the context of understanding both disk evolution and the interplay between disks and x - rays , the weak - lined t tauri star doar 21 ( a.k.a.v2246 oph , elias 2 - 14 , vssg 23 , gss 23 , roxs 8 , haro 1 - 6 , ylw 26 , hbc 637 , roxr1 13 ) presents an interesting case study .",
    "it has no strong evidence for accretion or a massive disk , and yet it is one of the few t tauri stars around which emission from h@xmath4  and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) molecules has been detected ( sec.[section : circumstellar ] ) .",
    "@xcite suggest that it may retain a gas - only disk in which all of the dust has coagulated into larger grains ; @xcite classify it as a `` transition disk , '' one in the process of being cleared from the inside out .",
    "in addition , it is the most luminous x - ray source in @xmath8 oph , making it an excellent laboratory to study the influence of x - rays and circumstellar material .",
    "here we present new gemini mid - infrared images , high - resolution optical spectra , and _",
    "high - resolution grating spectra of doar 21 .",
    "the primary contrast of doar 21 with the handful of pre  main - sequence stars previously observed at high x - ray spectral resolution ( fig .  [ figure : hr ] ) is the combination of its youth and lack of a strong accretion signature .",
    "doar 21 is embedded in the @xmath8 oph star - forming region ( see @xcite for a recent review ) , whereas a number of the others ( e.g. , tw hya , hen 3 - 600 , mp mus , and v4046 sgr , with ages of @xmath730 myr ) no longer lie in regions of active star formation , with all surrounding molecular gas having been dissipated . with an estimated age of @xmath9 myr , doar 21 is younger than these other stars .",
    "a few of the stars observed with high x - ray spectral resolution ( e.g. t tau , bp tau , ru lup ) are of a similar age to doar 21 , but all are classical t tauri stars with strong accretion signatures .",
    "the central questions here , then , are how much difference the young age and lack of strong accretion make in the x - ray emission of doar 21 ; what the distribution and physical conditions of its circumstellar material are ; and how the high - energy radiation field incident on the circumstellar material may influence its properties .     yr ) and more massive ( @xmath1 m@xmath2 ) than most of the t tauri stars observed previously . the pre  main - sequence evolutionary tracks shown are from @xcite .",

    "we present new high - resolution optical spectra which show that doar 21 is probably not accreting , but which are consistent with strong chromospheric activity . in this light",
    ", we then present our new x - ray observations ( sec.[section : x - ray ] ) and analyze the x - ray emission in detail through emission - line - ratio fits , modeling of the entire spectrum , and analysis of time variability of the emission before , during , and after a large flare . in sec .",
    "[ section : discussion ] , we discuss the influence of the star s x - ray and ultraviolet emission on its circumstellar environment . based on the level of activity suggested by our x - ray observations , we estimate the far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) flux , suggesting that it is sufficient to excite the observed pah emission even at hundreds of au from the star .",
    "finally , we present a possible geometry for the h@xmath4  emission , suggesting that it may be more akin to a photo - dissociation region ( pdr ) than a circumstellar disk .",
    "before considering our new x - ray data for doar 21 , here we consider new and existing data from other wavelengths , including new mid - infrared imaging and high - resolution optical spectroscopy .",
    "we also consider infrared and optical photometry and spectroscopy from the literature in order to build up a more complete picture of the stellar properties and circumstellar environment of doar 21 .",
    "spectral types in the literature are k0 @xcite from optical spectra and k0k2 @xcite from near - infrared spectra .",
    "following @xcite , we adopt a spectral type of k1 and effective temperature of 5080 k. they found a spectral type of b2 , and assuming @xmath106.2 they found a spectral type of g5k0 .",
    "a follow - up paper by @xcite used a broader range of colors and found @xmath11 and a spectral type of k0 , consistent with what we find here . ] the distance to doar 21 from a vlba parallax measurement is @xmath12 pc @xcite . using this distance and our fit to the de - reddened spectral energy distribution ( sec .",
    "[ section : sed ] ) , we estimate the stellar luminosity to be @xmath13 @xmath14 , where the uncertainty arises primarily from the large photometric variability and somewhat uncertain extinction .",
    "the vlba observations of @xcite show doar 21 to be a binary , with a projected separation of 5 mas ( 0.6 au ) in one of their observations .",
    "the orbital parameters are uncertain , but loinard et al .  estimate the semimajor axis to be 12 au .",
    "since the binary pair has been detected only at radio wavelengths thus far , there is no information about the mass ratio or the optical luminosity ratio . ascribing all of the luminosity to the primary star ( solid - lined star in fig .",
    "[ figure : hr ] ) yields a mass of @xmath1 @xmath15 and an age of @xmath16 yr . if the luminosity is split equally between the two stars ( dotted star in fig .",
    "[ figure : hr ] ) , the mass of each star is @xmath17 @xmath15 and the age is @xmath18 yr . there is some evidence in the optical spectra ( sec.[section : opticalspectrum ] ) that the secondary is contributing to the observed line width , suggesting that its optical luminosity is non - negligible ; thus the latter set of parameters may be closer to reality .",
    "we note that doar 21 is relatively massive among t tauri stars , and it has a k spectral type only because of its very young age . by an age of 34 myr",

    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of doar 21 gives some clues to the nature of its circumstellar environment .",

    "the observed broad - band colors are much redder than photospheric colors for a k1 star . to de - redden the photometry and to determine whether or not doar 21 shows any evidence of infrared excess , a signature of the presence of a circumstellar or circumbinary disk , we compared the sed of doar 21 to a model photosphere @xcite with @xmath25 k ( fig .",

    "thus , the broader profile of doar 21 is not an artifact of the mosaicing process .    to estimate the radial extent of the emission , we convolved an oversampled mips psf with gaussians of different radii , resampled them at the mips pixel scale , and compared their radial profiles to that of doar 21 .",
    "the profile of doar 21 is roughly consistent with a gaussian source with a sigma of 0.751 mips pixel ( 1825 ) . at the 122 pc distance of doar 21",

    "the data were taken with the standard chop and nod technique to remove sky background emission , and were processed with the standard gemini iraf pipeline .",
    "the chop throw was 15  at a position angle of 130 , parallel to the ridge of 24-  emission seen in the _ spitzer _  images ( fig.[figure : spitzer - image ] ) ; this chop direction was chosen to minimize variation of the background emission .",

    "although this result may represent a real change in the coronal plasma abundances during the flare , it may also be affected by the simplified two - temperature assumption in the model .",
    "the abundance parameter in the emission model is largely controlled by the line - to - continuum ratio , and the strength of the metal emission lines relative to the bremsstrahlung continuum is also affected by details of the emission measure distribution at high temperatures , where metals are generally fully ionized and contribute little overall line emission .",
    "another demonstration of the spectral changes associated with the flare is provided by the iron k - shell line emission , which is sensitive to the hottest plasma .",
    "the he - like fe xxv line complex near 1.86  has an emissivity that peaks near 60 mk , while the h - like fe xxvi line at 1.75  has an emissivity that peaks at temperatures somewhat above 100 mk .",

    "not only do the iron features increase in overall intensity during the flare , but the relative strength of the h - like feature compared to the he - like",
    "feature also evolves in the sense expected from the temperature changes seen in the apec  model fitting to the entire spectrum .",
    "the emission lines in the spectrum are relatively weak , but we are able to analyze the strengths of two important helium - like line complexes and use them as plasma diagnostics . specifically , the forbidden - to - intercombination line ratios of helium - like ions are sensitive to density , as collisions de - populate the metastable upper level @xmath110s of the forbidden line and populate the upper level @xmath110p of the intercombination line @xcite . thus higher densities decrease the forbidden - to - intercombination ( @xmath111 ) ratio ( with different critical densities for each element ) .",

    "we then discuss possible origins for this circumstellar material , focusing in particular on whether or not it is a disk , i.e.  gravitationally bound , centrifugally supported material .",
    "the most surprising result from the new observations presented here is the large spatial extent of the mid - infrared emission from doar 21 , which is puzzling to find around a cool star , and one with a very low millimeter flux .",
    "what this discovery has in common with the previous surprises about doar 21the detections of pah and h@xmath4emission  is that all of these observations are more commonly associated with more luminous , hotter stars .",
    "here we explore whether it is possible to construct a model that explains all of the data , and we focus in particular on trying to understand the influence of the uv and x - ray emission from doar 21 on its circumstellar material . because fuv radiation is important for radiative excitation of both h@xmath4  and pah emission ,",
    "we first discuss the fuv radiation field near doar 21 .      the ultraviolet flux from doar 21 is poorly known .",
    "it was not detected by iue @xcite ; examination of the archived iue spectrum places a rough upper limit of @xmath131 erg @xmath41 s@xmath21 at @xmath1323200  . given the large extinction to doar 21 ( roughly 13 magnitudes at @xmath133 given our adopted visual extinction ) , however , the star could have an ultraviolet flux that is several orders of magnitude above its photospheric flux and it would not have been detected by iue .",
    "given this situation , we take two approaches to estimating the level of uv radiation in the vicinity of doar 21 .",
    "first we consider the uv background in the region due to the nearby b2 star hd 147889 .",
    "then we use the available data on doar 21 s chromospheric and coronal activity to estimate the uv emission from its transition region .",
    "the b2 v star hd 147889 , at a projected distance of 0.4 pc from doar 21 , is responsible for exciting pah and h@xmath4  emission from much of the surrounding nebulosity @xcite . to determine the uv flux from hd 147889 arriving at the position of doar 21 and its surroundings , we integrated the flux from a synthetic spectrum based on a spherical , hydrostatic , class ( ii ) nlte model atmosphere from @xcite with @xmath134 k and @xmath135 , assuming @xmath136 @xmath14 for hd 147889 and a distance of 0.4 pc between the two stars @xcite . at this distance , the ultraviolet flux reaching doar 21 from hd 147889 ( assuming no attenuation ) is roughly 0.75 erg @xmath41 s@xmath21 in the bandpass 6.013.6 ev ( @xmath1372066  ) .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath138 , where @xmath139 is the flux in this wavelength interval expressed in units of a mean interstellar radiation field of @xmath140 erg @xmath41 s@xmath21 @xcite by @xcite and similar to the quantity @xmath141 used by @xcite ] .",

    "as noted above , however , given the high level of activity from doar 21 , there is likely to be significant uv emission from the transition region .    to estimate the fuv flux from doar 21 , we use as a template hd 283572  ( v987 tau ) , a weak - lined t tauri star with a similar mass , effective temperature , and x - ray properties .",

    "based on this analysis , we find @xmath151@xmath152 erg s@xmath21 .",
    "this analysis does not account for flux in the ly @xmath3 line , which can be very strong in stars with active chromospheres .",
    "we estimated the ly @xmath3  flux using the scaling relations between ly @xmath3  and x - ray surface flux derived by @xcite , who measured ly @xmath3  from a sample of nearby late - type stars at high spectral resolution with stis on hst , and thus were able to remove geocoronal emission and correct for interstellar absorption .",
    "the range of x - ray fluxes from doar 21 gives a range of ly @xmath3  surface fluxes of 0.8@xmath153 erg @xmath41 s@xmath21 , and thus a total @xmath154@xmath155 erg s@xmath21 .",
    "we caution , however , that there is only one star ( speedy mic ) in the @xcite sample with an x - ray surface flux as large as that from doar 21 , and so the scaling relations are not well - constrained in this regime .    under these assumptions",
    ", we estimate that the @xmath139 value produced by doar 21 s fuv flux is in the range of 4701100 at 11 ( 134 au ) from the star , the distance of the bright ridge in our images .",
    "thus , the estimated fuv flux from the star is equal to or somewhat greater than the external fuv flux at this distance .",
    "the total fuv flux ( from the combination of doar 21 s transition region and the b2 star background ) at the position of the bright ridge is then @xmath1561600 ; the internal and external fuv fluxes become equal at @xmath157 130210 au from doar 21 .",
    "if there is any attenuation of the external fuv flux in the @xmath158 pc between hd 147889 and doar 21 , then doar 21 s contribution to the total flux is even more dominant .",
    "having estimated the fuv flux near doar 21 , we can now examine the effect this flux would have on nearby material . in the sections below",
    ", we will examine in turn the continuum ( dust ) emission , the pah emission , and the h@xmath4  emission .",
    "consistent with the fuv flux estimates above , we will show that the emission shows signatures of being excited from the inside out , i.e.  by doar 21 rather than externally by hd 147889 . before turning to a discussion of the details of each type of emission , we close this section with a simple check of the energy balance in the circumstellar environment .",
    "we measured the flux from the circumstellar material by taking the fluxes in the largest aperture listed in table [ table : gemini - photometry ] and subtracting the fluxes in the smallest aperture to remove the stellar contribution .",
    "integrating from 10  to 20 , we find the luminosity of this material to be roughly @xmath159 erg s@xmath21 , the same order of magnitude as our estimate of @xmath160 .",
    "given the uncertainties in our flux estimate and the complexities of the various heating , cooling , and emission processes in the environment we do not suggest that there should be precise agreement here , but the order - of - magnitude agreement does indicate that doar 21 is a plausible source for powering the observed emission , which we now examine in more detail .      in order to study",
    "the continuum emission excess from doar 21 , which we here assume arises from thermal emission from dust grains , we need wavelength regions without significant spectral features .",
    "the spectrum taken by @xcite shows that the region encompassed by the 10.4  filter from our gemini observations is free of emission or absorption features ; in particular , there is no evidence of a silicate feature .",
    "while we do not have a corresponding spectrum in the 18.3  region , this part of the spectrum generally has not shown significant features in spitzer irs spectra of other young stars @xcite .",
    "some galaxies and star - forming regions with pah emission do show features at 17.8  and 18.9 , albeit on top of a significant continuum @xcite .",
    "we take this spectral region to sample primarily continuum emission ; if there is a contribution from some pah emission in this bandpass , the effect would be to raise the dust temperatures derived below .    using our gemini images , we integrated the flux in these two bandpasses in a region that is off the stellar position and thus probes only circumstellar flux .",
    "this yielded fluxes of 197 and 603 mjy at 10.4 and 18.3 , respectively .",
    "a single - temperature blackbody fit to these two fluxes yields a temperature estimate of roughly 215 k for the emitting material .",
    "while this estimate is obviously an oversimplification of the actual situation , the general result of a steeply - rising flux from 1018  is robust , indicating that the emitting material has a temperature in the hundreds of degrees k. for comparison , blackbody grains that have reached thermal equilibrium with the star s radiation field , given doar 21 s luminosity of 11.7 @xmath14 , would have a temperature of 44 k at 135 au ( 11 ) from the star and 31 k at 270 au from the star . at these temperatures ,",
    "the 18.3  to 10.4  flux ratio would be 10@xmath16110@xmath162 , rather than the observed value of @xmath163 .    while the derived dust temperature is far out of equilibrium",
    ", it is quite consistent with the expected behavior for very small grains ( vsgs ) excited by uv photons @xcite .",
    "grains with radii of a few nm can be transiently heated to temperatures of several hundred k by single uv photons , and an ensemble of such grains can contribute significant infrared emission . given that such small grains may form a continuum of sizes with pah molecules @xcite , it is perhaps not surprising to find them around doar 21 .",
    "nevertheless , it provides additional evidence for the importance of the fuv radiation in exciting the circumstellar material , and it is another respect in which doar 21 s environment is different from a typical circumstellar disk .      we have presented our new images in the 8.6 and 11.3  pah filters above ; here we briefly recap existing published and archival pah data for doar 21 .",
    "figure [ figure : pah ] shows the mid - infrared spectrum of doar 21 from @xcite along with the model photosphere .",
    "the data show a clear emission feature at @xmath164 , attributed by @xcite to emission from pahs .",
    "the data also show a rising slope shortward from @xmath165  to where the spectrum ends at 7.9 , consistent with the presence of a 7.7  pah emission feature .",
    "doar 21 was also observed by iso with the circularly - variable filter ( cvf ) on isocam , yielding a @xmath16680 spectrum from 5.116.6  of doar 21 and its surroundings with 6  pixels .",
    "these data were reprocessed by @xcite as part of the final reprocessing of all isocam cvf data , and we retrieved the reprocessed data from the iso archive .",
    "the data show a strong point source at the position of doar 21 , as well as a bright ridge of emission located 3090  ne of doar 21 and running nw ",
    "se ; this ridge is clearly visible in the _ spitzer _",
    "24-  image ( fig .",
    "[ figure : spitzer - image ] ; see also fig .  3 of @xcite for a larger view ) and",
    "can also be seen faintly in the 2mass k - band images .",
    "all pixels in the isocam 33 x 33 field of view show a rich pah spectrum , including emission features at 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 , 11.3 , and 12.7 .",
    "unfortunately , it is not possible to determine a reliable spectrum for doar 21 itself from these data . due to internal reflections in isocam",
    "when used with the cvf , the spectrum of doar 21 is contaminated by `` ghosts '' , reflections of stray light from elsewhere in the field of view @xcite .",
    "this is revealed by sharp discontinuities in the spectrum around 9 , the transition wavelength between cvf1 and cvf2 .",
    "the ghosts are significantly worse in cvf2 , and this discontinuity ( which is clearly present in a spectrum extracted at the position of doar 21 ) is a signature of stray light contamination @xcite .",
    "we suspect that the contamination arises from the bright ridge of emission to the ne of doar 21 , which is of the same order of magnitude in brightness at these wavelengths as doar 21 itself . because the background emission is diffuse and spatially variable , and the ghost size and strength are functions of wavelength , it is not possible to reconstruct the uncontaminated spectrum of doar 21 from these data .",
    "one of the most striking features of our new pah - filter images of doar 21 is the spatial variation of the 11.3  emission , with similar variations seen at 18.3 .",
    "the emission does not decrease smoothly with distance in the region near the star , but rather it is significantly brighter in a knot and partial arc beginning roughly 11 to the north and west of the star .",
    "in contrast , the 8.6  emission is much smoother , with about the same brightness in the region near the star as in the region that appears as a bright arc in the 11.3  image .",
    "thus , it appears that the [ 8.6]/[11.3 ] ratio may be higher near the star .",
    "however , the 8.6  emission is much fainter overall than the 11.3 emission , and the star is brighter , so it may be that any variation in the fainter 8.6 and 10.4  emission blends in with the wings of the stellar psf .",
    "if the apparent change in the [ 8.6]/[11.3 ] ratio is real , it is a useful diagnostic of the ionization state of pah molecules ; in laboratory spectra of pah molecules , the 11.3  ch out - of - plane bending mode weakens considerably in ionized pahs while the 8.6  ch in - plane bending mode strengthens somewhat @xcite . in astrophysical sources ,",
    "a decrease in the [ 8.6]/[11.3 ] ratio with distance from a central ionizing source has been observed in ngc 1333 @xcite and in the orion bar @xcite .    applying this interpretation to doar 21 leads to the conclusion that a significant fraction of the pah molecules within about 1  of the star are ionized , suppressing the [ 8.6]/[11.3 ] ratio in this region .",
    "this would indicate that doar 21 , not hd 147889 , is the dominant source of fuv flux in its circumstellar environment , consistent with our estimates above of the relative fuv fluxes ( sec .",
    "[ section : fuv ] ) .",
    "the first ionization potential for typical pah molecules is 68 ev @xcite , and thus there must be significant flux at energies @xmath167 ev near the star .    as noted above , it may be that the radial variation seen in the bright 11.3  emission is simply difficult to detect in the fainter 8.6  emission due to the low surface brightness .",
    "one piece of evidence in favor of this interpretation comes from comparison of the different continuum wavelength bands .",
    "since both the 10.4 and 18.3  bands are dominated by continuum emission from very small grains , they should show the same spatial variation .",
    "however , the bright 18.3  emission shows the same radial variation as the bright 11.3  emission , while the fainter 10.4 emission apparently does not , which might suggest that it is not seen simply due to low surface brightness , and that a similar effect might be present at 8.6 .",
    "if it is the case that the same radial variation is present in all bands , then it would represent a real change in surface density of material , with less material present near doar 21 , perhaps due to photoevaporation . in either case , the azimuthal distribution of material around doar 21 is clearly asymmetric ( fig .",
    "[ figure : gemini - azimuthal - profile ] ) .    while there is a sharp increase in the 11.3  emission at roughly 11 from the star , the brightness of this emission declines with radial distance beyond that point .",
    "the decline is roughly consistent with a falloff proportional @xmath168 , which is what would be expected from a uniform pah and small grain surface density with declining excitation due to geometric dilution of the exciting radiation .",
    "thus , the true extent of the circumstellar material may be much greater than that shown in our images , as already suggested by the hst and near - infrared images ( sec .",
    "[ section : gemini - data ] ) .      while we did not make any observations of h@xmath4  emission , the analysis of the vsg and pah emission in the preceding sections bears directly on the interpretation of previous h@xmath4  observations , which we discuss here . given the surprisingly large spatial extent of the emission seen in our images ,",
    "we pay particular attention to what constraints existing data put on the spatial distribution of the h@xmath4  emission .",
    "as noted above , @xcite detected emission in the h@xmath4  10 s(1 )  line at @xmath170  from doar 21 .",
    "their slit width was 08 and the seeing was approximately 14 @xcite . in their nod - differenced images , they found no evidence of any extension of the emission along the e - w slit beyond the 14 seeing disk . from the resolved velocity width of the line",
    ", they also argued that the gas must reside in a rotating circumstellar disk .",
    "@xcite observed doar 21 in the 00 s(2 ) pure rotational transition of h@xmath4  at @xmath171 .",
    "they detected emission in one observation using a 14 n - s slit with 14 seeing on the irtf , but they did not detect it in a subsequent observation with a 054 e - w slit with 05 seeing on gemini .",
    "the @xcite observations suggest that the s(2 ) h@xmath4emission is not uniformly distributed around the star and/or is time - variable .",
    "if we attribute the difference between the two observations solely to the spatial distribution of material , the data imply that the emitting gas lies primarily at an angular separation greater than 025 ( 30 au ) , and that it may be more concentrated to the n and/or s of the star .",
    "@xcite detected larger fluxes with the wider irtf slit than with the narrower gemini slit for four out of the five sources observed with both telescopes , suggesting that spatially - extended emission for the pure rotational transitions is not uncommon .",
    "we note , however , that a slit at any orientation will intercept flux from a disk at all disk radii ( though not all azimuths ) , so azimuthally - symmetric emission from gas in a disk , even at large radii , should contribute some flux even in the gemini slit .",
    "we discuss this point further in sec .",
    "[ section : disk ] , where we propose a possible geometry for the emitting material that is consistent with all the data .",
    "the suggestion that the h@xmath4  s(2 ) emission may lie preferentially to the n or s , combined with the emission geometry seen in our pah images , suggests that the h@xmath4  and pah emission could be coincident , and other observations suggest that this is not an uncommon occurrence .",
    "this is perhaps unsurprising , given that both molecules are excited by uv photons . in the orion bar pdr , the h@xmath4  10 s(1 )  emission and 3.3  pah emission are similarly distributed along the edge of the bar facing the ionizing o stars .",
    "closer to doar 21 , @xcite and @xcite conducted ground - based narrow - band imaging , showing that the sw edge of the bright bar lying ne of doar 21 ( seen in both the _ spitzer _  and iso images ) is also bright in the h@xmath4  10 s(1 )  line .",
    "further , @xcite show that the pah emission seen by isocam at @xmath1728.5  in this region correlates very well in strength and position ( albeit with modest spatial resolution ) with the h@xmath4  10 s(1 )  emission seen in the ground - based images , and with the h@xmath4  00 s(3 ) emission seen by the iso sws .",
    "an alternate interpretation of the @xcite observations is that the emission is time - variable and was below the detection threshold at the time of the gemini observation .",
    "the @xmath48 upper limit in the gemini observation is @xmath173 erg @xmath41 s@xmath21 , a factor of 2.6 below the flux level of the irtf detection .",
    "measured in the irtf observations ( m. bitner , personal communication ) , and thus it is slightly lower than the limit given in @xcite based on an assumed line width of 10 km s@xmath21 . ]",
    "the x - ray flux level from doar 21 is seen to vary by a factor of three on short timescales ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lightcurve ] ) ; if this translates into a corresponding variation in the fuv exciting the h@xmath4  emission , then that emission could vary by similar factors . however , if we attribute the difference between the two observations solely to variability , this hypothesis would require that the @xcite detection happened to coincide with the peak of a flare , and that the h@xmath4  flux in the gemini observation is just below the detection threshold .",
    "doar 21 has a relatively high x - ray flare rate of about one per day @xcite , but the fraction of time the x - ray flux is more than a factor of 2.6 above the quiescent level is small , probably less than an hour per day based on available data .",
    "multiple measurements exist at wavelengths from 0.39  ( @xmath23 ) through 4.8  ( @xmath174 ) .",
    "variability is seen at all wavelengths .",

    "two observations separated by 3 hours on the following night showed a similar variation , with @xmath23 brightening by 0.42 magnitudes while @xmath35 and @xmath32 faded by 0.04 and 0.05 magnitudes , respectively .",

    "observations of other stars with similar @xmath32 magnitudes observed during the same nights as the @xmath23 flares on doar 21 do not show @xmath23 magnitudes that are substantially different from the mean values for those stars , suggesting that the observed changes at @xmath23 in doar 21 are real , and not photometric errors .",
    "] such a large increase in the uv emission without a concurrent increase in @xmath32 can not be due to rotational modulation ( either of hot or cool spots ) , since that would increase the flux in all bands ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "these @xmath23-band brightenings are similar to flares seen on active main - sequence stars in that they are much brighter at @xmath23 than at @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "we note that both of these brightening events occur when the star is at the faint end of the observed @xmath23 range , i.e.  they are brightenings toward the mean value rather than above it .",
    "this may simply indicate that the star is flaring much of the time and that the observed mean value in the data of @xcite is characteristic of the flares rather than the photosphere ; this is consistent with the fit to the sed ( fig .",
    "[ figure : sed ] ) .",
    "the @xmath23 and @xmath35 magnitudes are positively correlated with each other ( with a larger amplitude at @xmath23 ) , but neither the @xmath23 or @xmath35 magnitudes nor the @xmath177 color is correlated with @xmath32 .",
    "the bluest observed @xmath178 color for doar 21 in the photometry of @xcite is @xmath179 , observed on two consecutive nights .",

    "flares from such stars have a mean @xmath178 of @xmath181 @xcite , consistent with the bluest color seen from doar 21 .",
    "doar 21 s @xmath182-band emission is polarized at @xmath183% @xcite .",
    "the large visual extinction toward doar 21 suggests that this could be attributed to interstellar polarization from overlying cloud material not closely associated with the star .",
    "however , the polarization is variable both in amplitude and in position angle @xcite . since a cloud far in the foreground",
    "would not be expected to change on short timescales , this variability suggests a circumstellar origin for doar 21 s polarization ; this is also quite consistent with the observed asymmetry of the circumstellar material , as scattering off an asymmetric distribution will give a net polarization in the unresolved light .",
    "given the discovery reported here that the circumstellar material around doar 21 is quite extended ( sec.[section : gemini - data ] ) , the observed variation in polarization percentage could be due to measuring with different aperture sizes that include different amounts of the extended emission : the percentage polarization measured by @xcite in a 43-diameter aperture is smaller than that measured by @xcite in a 78 aperture .",
    "what is strikingly clear from the observations presented above is that the high - energy emission from doar 21 has strong interactions with material in its circumstellar environment , even on scales of hundreds of au .",
    "what is less clear , however , is the relationship of the observed material to doar 21 , and specifically to what extent the extended emission is related to any orbiting , bound circumstellar ( or circumbinary ) disk that doar 21 has or once had .",
    "the definitive answer to this will await further , higher - resolution observations , in particular spatially- and velocity - resolved mapping of the h@xmath4  emission . here , we close the discussion with an examination of evidence for and against a keplerian disk around doar 21 .",
    "one of the primary arguments that @xcite made for the h@xmath4  emission arising from a disk is that extended , non - disk material would have a narrower line width than the 9 km s@xmath21  fwhm width they observed for doar 21 s 10 s(1 )  emission .",
    "while we examine this line width more quantitatively below , we first note that doar 21 has the narrowest h@xmath4  line of any of the detections of h@xmath4  from t tauri stars and herbig ae / be stars at both 10 s(1)@xcite and 00 s(2 ) @xcite .    to interpret the line width",
    ", we must take into account the fact that the observed line width is the convolution of the intrinsic line width with the instrumental profile .",
    "the @xcite observations had a fwhm spectral resolution of 5 km s@xmath21 .",
    "assuming gaussian profiles for both the spectral response of the instrument and the observed line , the intrinsic line width is then 7.5 km s@xmath21 .",
    "if interpreted solely as a thermal line width , this would imply a kinetic temperature of 2450 k. @xcite do not quote an uncertainty for the measured line width ; assuming a 1 km s@xmath21  total uncertainty for the deconvolved line width ( reflecting some uncertainty in both the measured line width and the spectral resolution ) , the range of derived kinetic temperatures is then 17003300 k. the lower end of this temperature range is quite consistent with temperatures generally found for 10 s(1 )  emitting gas .",
    "for example , @xcite quote a standard thermal excitation temperature of 2000 k. @xcite observed extended h@xmath4  around several t tauri stars , and from the ratios of several lines they derive lte temperatures of 18002300 k for h@xmath4  around t tauri stars .",
    "@xcite model the fluorescent h@xmath4  emission from tw hya s disk and find kinetic temperatures of @xmath184 k for the h@xmath4 . while the gas in some of those sources may be shock - heated , which is unlikely for doar 21 ,",
    "these observations show that h@xmath4  can survive and emit strongly at the temperatures necessary to explain the observed line width in doar 21 . similarly",
    ", the models of @xcite and @xcite predict that the bulk of the h@xmath4  10 s(1 )  emission from disks irradiated by x - rays and uv comes from gas with temperatures of 10002000 k , and similar results are found in models of pdrs @xcite .",
    "collisional dissociation of h@xmath4  at these temperatures is insignificant @xcite .",
    "thus , the h@xmath4  temperature necessary to explain doar 21 s observed line width solely with thermal broadening is consistent both with theoretical expectations and with observations of other sources .",
    "theoretical models show that it is plausible that doar 21 can heat gas to these temperatures at large distances from the star .",
    "the fuv flux that we estimate for doar 21 combined with hd 147889 ( sec.[section : fuv ] ) corresponds to @xmath1851600 at a distance of 130 au ( 11 ) from doar 21 , the location of the bright pah emission ridge .",
    "this is similar to the fuv flux in the @xcite models at radii of @xmath186100 au , and thus we might expect conditions at 130 au from doar 21 to be similar to those at 40100 au in the models .",
    "this range of radii extends beyond the @xmath187 au distance at which the h@xmath4  10 s(1 )  emission peaks in those models , but it is also the case that doar 21 has an x - ray luminosity that is 50 times larger and an x - ray spectrum that is much harder than that assumed in these models ( which base their assumed x - ray emission on that of tw hya ) , thus contributing an additional source of heating .",
    "thus , while the models do not apply directly to doar 21 , plausible scaling from them suggests that h@xmath4  at @xmath188 au from doar 21 could have @xmath189 k , necessary to produce the observed line width with thermal motions , and could emit at the observed level , since the predicted h@xmath4  flux in both the 10 s(1 )  and pure rotational lines in these models is similar to that observed for doar 21 .    to summarize this part of the discussion ,",
    "the primary argument of @xcite for the presence of a disk around doar 21 is essentially that the only way to produce the observed h@xmath4  10 s(1)line width is from rotation in a disk .",
    "however , we have shown that the observed width is a plausible thermal line width for h@xmath4illuminated with a strong fuv and x - ray flux , and that the flux from doar 21 is sufficient to produce the necessary heating at distances of @xmath190 au from the star , consistent with the position of the observed pah and vsg emission .",
    "while the match between this expected thermal broadening and the observed line width does not rule out the gas also having some bulk motion , for example from rotation in a disk , it does show that rotation is not required to explain the data .",
    "indeed , the observed line width sets some significant limits on the @xmath191 of the gas .",
    "the expected keplerian velocity of gas orbiting a 2.2 @xmath192 star at 130 au is 3.8 km s@xmath21 . given the uncertainties in the range of possible temperatures for the emitting gas , such an orbital velocity is likely allowed by the data for any @xmath193 .",
    "orbiting gas at significantly smaller radii , however , would require values of @xmath193 significantly less than one .",
    "as noted above , the two measurements of h@xmath4  from doar 21 by @xcite gave different results , suggesting that the bulk of the 00 s(2 ) emitting gas lies to the north or south of the star .",
    "however , the 5.6 km s@xmath21  fwhm of the s(2 ) line suggests that this gas is not coincident with the gas detected by @xcite in the 10 s(1)line . in general",
    "the s(2 ) line traces cooler gas , so the @xcite observations may be tracing gas that is somewhat farther from doar 21 than the @xcite observations .",
    "we have presented above a large body of data on doar 21 , some of it seemingly contradictory . to conclude this discussion ,",
    "we present here a broad picture of doar 21 s circumstellar environment .",
    "this is not the only possible scenario , but we suggest that it is consistent with all of the available data , and it is testable with future observations . in this scenario ,",
    "doar 21 no longer possesses any substantial orbiting circumstellar material , either in the form of gas or dust .",
    "either the system never had much of a disk ( possibly as the result of the formation of the binary companion ) , or the extreme fuv and x - ray luminosity have photoevaporated the disk .",
    "the excess infrared emission , as well as the h@xmath4  emission , comes from the extended material seen in our gemini images , at hundreds of au from the star .",
    "this material may be molecular cloud material that is not directly associated with the formation of doar 21 ; doar 21 may simply have moved into the vicinity of this gas because of its motion through the cloud , as we discuss further below . the fuv flux from doar 21",
    "has created a small - scale pdr in this nearby gas , exciting the observed h@xmath4 , pah , and vsg emission . as in models of pdrs @xcite , the 10 s(1 )",
    "emission is at the edge of the pdr and extends farther into the ionized region , explaining why @xcite detect some emission in an e - w slit that does not intersect the bright ridge to the north , but @xcite do not detect emission in a transition that traces cooler gas .    one major testable prediction of this scenario is the spatial distribution of h@xmath4  emission .",
    "this could be mapped with narrow - band filters , or ( ideally ) with an integral - field spectrograph that would also measure the line widths and line ratios to probe the physical conditions in the emitting gas .",
    "for example , observations of both the s(1 ) 10 and the s(1 ) 21 lines would probe whether the gas is predominantly thermally excited or pumped by fuv photons .",
    "spatially - unresolved observations at high spectral resolution should detect more flux in a n  s slit than in an e  w one ; making observations close in time with different slit orientations would help determine whether time variability or spatial distribution is more important .",
    "given that pdr models predict that 10 s(1 )  emission is spread over a range of emitting temperatures , the 10 s(1 )  line measured in a n  s slit may have a stronger flux and a somewhat narrower width than the line observed by @xcite as it may sample both hotter and cooler gas .",
    "in contrast , if there is a keplerian disk that produces the 10 s(1 )  emission , as suggested by @xcite , then closely - spaced observations with different slit orientations should produce the same flux and line width , and mapping of the line emission should show it closely associated with the stellar position of doar 21 .",
    "the proper motion of doar 21 provides an interesting , though admittedly speculative , piece of circumstantial evidence in favor of the hypothesis that doar 21 is illuminating ambient cloud material rather than a circumstellar disk .",
    "@xcite measure a proper motion of @xmath194 mas yr@xmath21 for doar 21 .",
    "this proper motion in ra is significantly different from the mean proper motion for @xmath8 oph members of @xmath195 mas yr@xmath21 @xcite , and yet there is ample evidence from the measured distance , luminosity , li absorption , and x - ray properties that doar 21 is a young star associated with the cloud .",
    "@xcite gives proper motions for 38 candidate @xmath8 oph members .",
    "not counting the three stars that mamajek rejects as non - members , the only star with an ra proper motion as discrepant from the mean as doar 21 s motion is gss 20 ( rox 7 ) , which @xcite flag as `` dwarf ? '' , i.e. a possible non - member .    if the mean @xmath8 oph proper motion is representative of the space motion of the gas near doar 21 , then doar 21 has a tangential motion of @xmath196 mas yr@xmath21 ( @xmath197 km s@xmath21 ) westward relative to the gas .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that there is less material visible to the east of doar 21 ( fig.[figure : gemini - image ] ) than in other directions . at this velocity",
    ", doar 21 would have been 1  to the east just 60 years ago , and could have photoevaporated or ionized much of the material in its vicinity , just as it appears to be doing now in the region within 100 au of the star .",
    "such a high velocity relative to the ambient gas would be unusual , given the typical 12 km s@xmath21 velocity dispersions of young associations , but not unheard of .",
    "one example is the high - velocity young star pv cep @xcite , which is moving at @xmath198 km s@xmath21  relative to its local cloud .    to close",
    ", we note that the strong pah emission at large distances from doar 21 , and the implied strength of the fuv flux needed to excite it , lends empirical support to the hypothesis of @xcite that there may be significant fuv flux from t tauri stars even after accretion has ceased .",
    "such a flux might enable photoevaporation to disperse outer disks on a short timescale even after accretion from the inner disk ceases .",
    "we have presented a variety of new data on doar 21 in an attempt to understand its circumstellar environment and the influence of high - energy radiation on it .",
    "high - resolution mid - infrared images show pah and very small grain emission in an irregular distribution over hundreds of au from the star , with little emission from the inner 100 au where a circumstellar disk might lie . a new high - resolution x - ray grating spectrum from _ chandra _ reveals a very luminous , hard corona , dominated by plasma at temperatures up to @xmath6 k ; neither this spectrum nor new high - resolution optical spectra show any evidence for accretion .",
    "the inferred fuv radiation from the transition region of doar 21 is strong enough to excite the observed pah , vsg , and h@xmath4emission , creating a small - scale pdr around doar 21 .",
    "this strong radiation may also have played a role in removing any disk from around doar 21 , despite its young age .",
