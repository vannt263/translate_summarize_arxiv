    "the two - baryon system with spin @xmath3 , isospin @xmath4 and strangeness @xmath0 is of particular interest in the strangeness nuclear physics , because of the possible existence of the h - dibaryon .",
    "the h - dibaryon was predicted to be stable against the strong decay with the mit bag model  @xcite .",
    "a remarkable recent finding by the lattice qcd simulations is that the two - baryon system of these quantum numbers indeed supports a bound state at relatively heavy quark mass region  @xcite . on the other hand , at the physical point",
    ", the existence of the bound h - dibaryon is confronted by a challenge from several experimental data .",
    "the observation of the double @xmath5 hypernuclei  @xcite excludes the existence of the h - dibaryon with the binding energy larger than @xmath6 mev .",
    "the belle collaboration searched for the h - dibaryon in the @xmath7 and @xmath8 decays , finding no clear evidence in the @xmath9 and @xmath1 mass spectra  @xcite .",
    "the h - dibaryon signal was not found also in the @xmath9 spectrum from the pb - pb collisions at @xmath10 tev performed by the alice collaboration at large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite .",
    "recently , the star collaboration extracted the @xmath1 correlation function at the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic )  @xcite .",
    "a detailed analysis of the star data indicates the attractive scattering length of the @xmath1 system , as long as the pair purity parameter @xmath11 is constrained by the measured @xmath12 ratio  @xcite .",
    "the attraction at threshold is consistent with the absence of the bound h - dibaryon below the threshold    in view of the lattice results and the current status of experimental searches , a plausible scenario is that the h - dibaryon is unbound at the physical point , while it is bound below the @xmath1 threshold when the quark masses are increased . in other words , there will be a level crossing of the h - dibaryon state and the @xmath1 state along with the change of the quark masses .",
    "this implies the existence of the quark mass region where the @xmath1 system supports a very shallow bound state with almost zero binding energy , having an infinitely large scattering length .",
    "such a situation is called the unitary limit where various interesting phenomena will take place both in the few - body and many - body systems  @xcite . in this respect ,",
    "the h - dibaryon in the @xmath1 scattering is analogous to the @xmath13 meson in the @xmath14 scattering where the efimov effect of three pions is predicted to occur in a certain unphysical quark mass region  @xcite . to examine this possibility for the @xmath1 system ,",
    "we need to know how the h - dibaryon in the @xmath1 scattering behaves with the variation of the quark masses .",
    "the quark mass dependence of the h - dibaryon has been studied by two complementary approaches .",
    "one is to evaluate the nambu - goldstone ( ng ) boson loop effect to the flavor singlet bare h - state  @xcite .",
    "another study adopts chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) for baryon - baryon systems with four - point contact interaction and the ng boson exchange contributions  @xcite .",
    "the physical picture of the h - dibaryon in the former approach corresponds to the compact six - quark state , while the latter approach deals with the loosely bound baryon - baryon molecular state . in both cases ,",
    "the h - dibaryon is found to be unbound at the physical point when the lattice qcd data is used to determine the unknown constants .",
    "in general , the dominant non - analytic contribution of the quark mass dependence of hadron masses comes from the chiral loop of the ng boson . in the case of the dibaryon system near the threshold , however , a substantial contribution is expected from the energetically closer two - baryon channels , which are not considered in refs .",
    "the relative importance of the ng boson loop is suppressed when the quark masses are increased , and the correct near - threshold scaling  @xcite can not be reproduced without the coupling to the baryon - baryon channels .",
    "chpt is the standard and systematic tool to study the quark mass dependence of hadrons .",
    "however , the available lattice results in the su(3 ) limit ( the ng boson mass is about 400 - 800 mev ) may not be in the region where the perturbation theory well converges .",
    "in addition , the symmetry argument does not specify the relevant hadronic degrees of freedom other than the ng bosons .",
    "for instance , the existence of a bare h - dibaryon field is in principle not excluded .    in this paper",
    ", we study the quark mass dependence of the h - dibaryon and the near - threshold @xmath1 scattering , with the lattice qcd data being constraints . to this end , we focus on the characteristic length scales in the lattice qcd simulations in the su(3 ) limit . in the simulations in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is found that the scattering length is larger than @xmath15 fm  @xcite , while the interaction range estimated by the ng - boson exchange @xmath16 is at most 0.4 fm .",
    "however , since the pion is the lowest energy excitation in qcd , @xmath17 can be regarded as the upper limit of the range of the strong interaction . ] in such cases , the interaction can be regarded as pointlike and the pionless framework of the effective field theory ( eft ) should be valid to describe the near - threshold phenomena  @xcite .",
    "we thus construct an eft to study the h - dibaryon in the two - baryon scattering , as a generalization of the eft for the nuclear forces .",
    "we then introduce the quark mass dependence in the parameters of the eft , with the lattice qcd result in the su(3 ) limit  @xcite being the guiding principle .",
    "this enables us to extrapolate the scattering amplitude with the up and down quark mass @xmath18 and the strangeness quark mass @xmath19 .",
    "preliminary results with only the singlet component interaction can be found in ref .",
    "here we present the complete formulation including 8 and 27 components , and the detailed discussion on the behavior of the @xmath1 scattering amplitude and the structure of h - dibaryon .",
