    "step emulsification is a microfluidic technique for generating monodisperse droplets with highly controllable sizes and production rates ( priest 2006 ) .",
    "the process relies on breakup of a long and wide confined sheet of fluid , surrounded by a second fluid , at a step geometry , consisting of a single shallow and wide microchannel that abruptly merges into a deep reservoir ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : overview ] ) . at the step ,",
    "the interface between the two fluids takes the shape of a tongue narrowing in the flow direction ; we call this the capillary self - focusing .",
    "when the self - focused pointed tongue enters into the reservoir , the interface becomes unstable resulting in the formation of droplets at the step .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that in the focusing region , a cylindrical thread is formed and becomes unstable by the resulting lack of confinement , as it enters the reservoir , presumably by a rayleigh - plateau instability mechanism ( li 2015 ) .",
    "previously , we showed that the width of this focusing region is directly related to the transition of breakup regimes ( hein 2015a ) , namely the jet- and step - breakup regimes , where the breakup transitions from a quasi - steady ( jet - breakup ) to a transient ( step - breakup ) regime ( see fig .

    "@xmath10 is the volume of fluid function defined as @xmath11 and @xmath12 , for a two fluid system ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "the evolution of @xmath10 satisfies the advection equation @xmath13 the numerical discretization and validations are described in detail in ( afkhami and renardy 2013 ) .",
    "this simplified model can significantly reduce the computational cost and complexity , while allowing to keep the essential features of the flow .",
    "furthermore , our computational model relies on the assumption that the pressure at the boundary , where the fluid exits into the reservoir , is the uniform pressure in the reservoir .",
    "this hypothesis is computationally investigated by comparing the numerical results with the experimental measurements .",
    "in particular , we conjecture that the pressure boundary condition becomes important when the width of the neck is comparable to the depth of the microchannel . a correction to the pressure boundary condition at the outflow",
    "is then proposed , relying only on a single free parameter , which remains to be determined by comparison to experimental data .",
    "we present the experimental observations and the numerical results based on the hele ",
    "shaw approximation combined with a volume of fluid method for computing the interface motion and for modeling the surface tension .",
    "figure [ fig : fig1 ] shows a schematic of the flow domain and the corresponding boundary conditions used in the numerical model . for all the results here , we fix the viscosity ratio to 1 and set the same pressure gradient for each phase at the inlet ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "we also fix @xmath15 . experimental results in ( priest 2006 ) and",
    "( hein 2015b ) show that the transition of jet- to step - breakup regime is independent of the viscosity ratio when the results are presented in terms of the rescaled filament width @xmath16 as a function of ca .",
    "we therefore do not consider unmatched viscosities in this work .",
    "to model the reservoir , we set a zero pressure ( @xmath17 is the reference pressure in the reservoir ) at the outlet ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "we account for the influence of the growing three - dimensional droplet in the reservoir and the reservoir itself with a simple pressure boundary condition at where the fluid exits into the reservoir . specifically , the outflow pressure boundary condition is defined as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the pressure correction parameter and the out - of - plane curvature is assumed to be constant and equal to @xmath21 , i.e.  @xmath22 represents the laplace pressure at the neck ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "next , we examine this simple pressure boundary condition in both the jet - breakup regime , where @xmath23 , and close to the transition to step - breakup regime , where @xmath24 .",
    "we will show that the pressure correction is needed , when close to the transition to step - breakup regime , for reasonable agreement with physical experiments .",
    "we however note that since the pressure beyond the step is unknown , we can only speculate either the inflating three - dimensional drop in the reservoir or the out - of - plane curvature to be the physical origin of the pressure correction .",

    "next , we will consider the breakup regime close to the transition from jet- to the step - breakup .",
    "we are going to define the transition of the jet - breakup to the step - breakup as when the dispersed phase forms a circular jet upon exiting into the reservoir .",
    "in reality , this should happen when @xmath27 , because the dispersed phase will become unstable below this width due to the rayleigh - plateau type of instability .",

    "the results show that decreasing the pressure in the dispersed phase at the step by a factor @xmath35 results in an increase in @xmath33 by a factor of @xmath36 .",

    "[ fig3](a ) .",
    "as demonstrated , the capillary focusing becomes less pronounced with a decrease of the pressure in the dispersed phase at the exit .",
    "we note again that when @xmath26 , the pressure inside the dispersed phase at the exit boundary is just @xmath22 , i.e.  the laplace pressure of a meniscus of mean curvature @xmath21 .    as in ( hein 2015a )",
    ", we define the critical ca number as the capillary number for which the jet - breakup transitions to a step - breakup for a fixed @xmath37 .",
    "as discussed above , and shown experimentally in ( hein 2015a ) , this transition occurs when @xmath38 . for @xmath39 , the experiments of ( hein 2015a ) finds the critical ca @xmath40 .",
    "we next investigate whether we can find an @xmath20 that permits @xmath27 for @xmath32 at ca close to the experimentally observed transition from jet- to step - breakup regime .",
    "for each @xmath20 , we vary the ca number to obtain the value of ca for which @xmath27 .",
    "we find that only for @xmath41 , we can obtain @xmath27 for ca @xmath42 . from this analysis",
    ", we can infer that the transition from jet- to step - breakup is reached at ca @xmath42 only if the corrected pressure boundary condition at the outflow is employed .",
    "this corrected pressure boundary condition corresponds to a significantly smaller laplace pressure inside the dispersed phase at the exit , which could be the consequence of a smaller out - of - plane curvature than considered when @xmath26 ; i.e. @xmath21 .",
    "one possible physical explanation can be that in the step - breakup regime , upon the formation , the droplet is initially confined and rapidly ` feels ' the reservoir , causing it to assume a smaller out - of - plane curvature than @xmath21 .",
    "we therefore conjecture that the capillary focusing is strongly sensitive to the values of the considered out - of - plane curvatures at the exit , and therefore the discrepancy between the numerical results and the experimental data is most likely explained through this sensitivity .",
    "we thus show that our correction to the outflow pressure boundary condition can be an effective way to achieve numerical results that agree reasonably well with experimental measurements , without resorting to fully three - dimensional simulations .     + ( a ) +   with no pressure boundary condition correction at the outflow , @xmath26 ( red ) , and for ca @xmath43 with a pressure boundary condition correction at the outflow , @xmath41 ( blue ) ; @xmath27 .",

    "@xmath32.,title=\"fig:\",width=328 ] + ( b )    however , the precise prediction of the critical ca number ( i.e.  the ca for which @xmath27 ) , by introducing the pressure correction @xmath20 , comes with the expense of a reduced focusing effect .",
    "figure [ fig4](a ) shows that we obtain @xmath27 for ca @xmath31 when @xmath26 and for ca @xmath43 when @xmath41 .",
    "we remind that in ( hein 2015a ) , the breakup regime transition is reported to occur at ca@xmath40 .",
    "figure [ fig4](a ) shows that the focusing effect is much stronger when @xmath26 and ca @xmath31 than when @xmath41 and ca @xmath43 .",
    "this is somehow counterintuitive .",
    "it shows that if we do not consider any pressure correction at the outflow , i.e.  @xmath26 , a much larger ca must be attained in order to obtain @xmath27 , leading to a more profound capillary focusing effect .",
    "figure [ fig4](b ) demonstrates the local change of the interface shape in the focusing region by plotting the computed interface curvature for ca @xmath31 and @xmath26 , and for ca @xmath43 and @xmath41 .",
    "the results show the abrupt change in the curvature in the narrowing region ; curvature becomes negative in the focusing region .",
    "as shown , the increase in the capillary number results in the decrease of the length scale over which the curvature changes sign , i.e.  the focusing region length scale .",
    "we also note that with @xmath26 , we arrive at @xmath48 at the outlet ( @xmath18 ) , while smaller @xmath20 results in a smaller laplace pressure at the outlet .      [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     in ( hein 2015b ) , multiple breakup regimes are addressed . in their work , the authors show that , when @xmath49 , a variety of breakup regimes can be observed depending on the ca number .",
    "for example , they show that when @xmath50 is fixed and @xmath51 , a double jet - breakup can occur , for a particular range of small ca numbers , which collapses into a single jet - breakup by increasing the ca number . in fig .",
    "[ fig5](a - b ) , we show the experimental observation of these two breakup scenarios .",
    "we attribute the double jet - breakup to the strong confinement .",
    "the transition from double to single jet - breakup is discussed in details in ( hein 2015b ) .",
    "here we also numerically show the existence of these breakup regimes .",
    "figures [ fig5](c - d ) show simulation results of different breakup regimes for ca@xmath52 ( double jet - breakup ) and ca=@xmath53 ( single jet - breakup ) when @xmath54 .",
    "this transition is in agreement with our experiments previously documented in ( hein 2015b ) . for these simulations , we use @xmath26 .",
    "these unprecedented results provide excellent insight into the capillary self - focusing phenomena , capturing multiple breakup regimes using our simple pressure boundary condition .",
    "the numerical results shown in figs .",
    "[ fig5](c - d ) also exhibit the strong capillary focusing effect when increasing confinement .",
    "figure [ fig5](d ) shows that the front of the filament is almost flat at the exit , in agreement with the profile in fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) . upon decreasing the ca number , i.e.  increasing the capillary focusing effect",
    ", such a wide and flat interface allows easy formation of another jet at the exit ( fig . [",
    "fig5](c ) ) .",
    "our experiments show that for a double jet - breakup , droplets that are formed in the reservoir ( see fig . [ fig5](a ) ) grow and elongate while traveling downstream ; during this elongation , the two tips formed at the step are pushed outwards .",
    "the absence of this effect explains the difference in the location of the two tips which are more centered in the simulation .",
    "we confirm the validity of our numerical simulations , based on the classical hele  shaw formulation and a simple pressure boundary condition at which the fluid exits into the reservoir , by comparing with experimental results . despite the inherent assumptions , the computational framework describes the capillary self - focusing consistently with our experimental findings .",
    "for the jet - breakup regime and sufficiently large ca numbers , we show that the numerical model well captures the focusing profile without any correction to the pressure boundary condition .",
    "close to the transition from a jet - breakup regime to a step - breakup regime , a pressure correction is required in order to predict the transition threshold .",
    "the correction is most likely due to the effects of the expanding three - dimensional droplet in the reservoir or an out - of - plane curvature that becomes smaller than @xmath21 because of the sudden relief of the confinement at the step , or a combination of these . for further consideration of these effects ,",
    "fully three - dimensional computations are needed .",
    "we leave this extension for future work .",
    "we also conjecture that the pressure boundary condition becomes important when the width of the focusing region is comparable to the depth of the shallow microchannel .",
    "the corrected pressure boundary condition at the outflow takes into account a single free parameter , to be determined by comparison with experimental data .",
    "our numerical results also provide an excellent insight into the capillary self - focusing phenomena when there exists a strong confinement .",
    "in particular , consistently with our experimental results , we show that our numerical simulations can identify a double jet - breakup regime and its transition to a single jet - breakup regime upon decreasing the confinement or increasing the ca number . ongoing work in microfluidics drop generation makes our results highly relevant for technical applications .",
    "for example , for droplet based microfluidic systems ( see e.g.  seemann 2012 ) , when using channel geometries such as the ones in this work , the occurrence of multiple breakup sites at a topographic step on the same filament will be likely or even desired , e.g.  for the simultaneous particle or cell encapsulation or filtering , providing a novel tool in the droplet microfluidics applications .",
