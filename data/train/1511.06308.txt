    "a theory of _ clifford parallelisms _ on the line set of a projective space over a field @xmath2 was developed already several decades ago ; see @xcite and @xcite for a detailed survey .",
    "this theory is based upon _ projective double spaces _ and their algebraic description via left and right multiplication in two classes of @xmath2-algebras :  _ quaternion skew fields _ with centre @xmath2 and  _ purely inseparable field extensions of @xmath2 _ satisfying some extra property .",
    "more precisely , this theory is built up from _ two _ parallelisms , hence the name `` double space '' .",
    "these parallelisms are identical in case and distinct otherwise .",
    "it is common to distinguish between them by adding the appropriate attribute `` left '' or `` right '' .    in the present paper we aim at giving characterisations of a _ single _ clifford parallelism .",
    "we confine ourselves to the three - dimensional case .",
    "first , we collect the necessary background information in some detail , as it is widespread over the literature . in section  [",
    "sect : external ] , we consider a three - dimensional projective space @xmath0 on a vector space @xmath1 over a field @xmath2 ( of arbitrary characteristic ) and the klein quadric @xmath4 representing the lines of @xmath0 . each _ external plane to the klein quadric _ , _",
    "i.e. _ a plane in the ambient space of @xmath4 that has no point in common with @xmath4 , is shown to give rise to a parallelism of @xmath0 .",
    "polarising such a plane with respect to the klein quadric yields a second plane , which is also external to @xmath4 , and hence a second parallelism .",
    "we establish in theorem  [ thm : doublespace ] that these parallelisms turn @xmath0 into a projective double space , which therefore can be described algebraically in the way we sketched above . the main result in section  [ sect : cliff - klein ]",
    "is theorem  [ thm : c+c ] , where we reverse the previous construction .",
    "what this all amounts to is a _ one - one correspondence between clifford parallelisms and planes that are external to the klein quadric_. finally , in section  [ sect : character ] we present two characterisations of a clifford parallelism .",
    "both of them avoid the ambient space of the klein quadric , even though our proofs rely on the aforementioned correspondence .",
    "theorem  [ thm : hyper ] characterises a parallelism as being clifford via the property that any two distinct parallel classes are contained in a _",
    "geometric hyperplane _ of the grassmann space formed by the lines of @xmath0 .",
    "a second characterisation is given in theorem  [ thm : crossed ] ; it makes use of a presumably new criterion , namely what we call the _ condition of crossed pencils_.    when dealing with clifford parallelisms in general , one must not disregard the rich literature about the classical case over the real numbers .",
    "the recent articles @xcite and @xcite provide a detailed survey ; further sources can be found in @xcite and @xcite . some of the classical results remain true in a more general setting , even though not in all cases . for example , a quadric without real points will carry two reguli after its complexification .",
    "any such regulus can be used to characterise a clifford parallelism in the real case . by @xcite ,",
    "this result still applies ( with some subtle modifications ) in case   but , according to @xcite , it fails in case  .",
    "a crucial question is therefore to find classical results that can be generalised without limitation .",
    "many of our findings are of this kind , and we shall give references to related work over the real numbers in the running text .    finally , for the sake of completeness , let us mention that higher - dimensional analogues of clifford parallelisms can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
