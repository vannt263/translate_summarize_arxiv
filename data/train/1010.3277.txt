    "coherent and squeezed states are known to be very important in many fields of physics .",
    "the coherent states were discovered in 1926 by schrdinger @xcite , while the squeezed states were introduced by kennard in 1927 @xcite .",
    "however , these works were , in the main , ignored or forgotten until the sixties , when these states became very popular and received a lot of attention with respect to both the mathematical and physical points of view . among many interesting papers ,",
    "let us mention the works of glauber @xcite , klauder @xcite , and nieto @xcite . in the particular field of quantum optics , the books of walls and milburn @xcite , gazeau @xcite and rand @xcite are very good reading which also consider the applications .",
    "the study of squeezed states for systems admitting an infinite discrete spectrum , obtained as a generalisation of coherent states , has been recently the center of much attention ( see , for example , @xcite ) .    in modern developments ,",
    "coherent states are standardly defined by three equivalent ways : displacement operator method , ladder ( annihilation ) operator method and the minimum uncertainty method ( for review see for example @xcite ) . starting first with the original definition for the case of the harmonic oscillator , coherent states have been generalised for other systems .",
    "we can use , for example , the definition of klauder @xcite saying that they are obtained as the following superposition of energy eigenstates @xmath0 @xmath1 the sum is taken over all the discrete values of @xmath2 .",
    "the parameter @xmath3 is a complex variable in general , @xmath4 is a normalization factor and @xmath5 is a set of strictly positive parameters , usually depending on the energy of the system under consideration .",
    "these last quantities correspond to a moment problem ( see @xcite for details ) .    introducing ladder operators",
    "@xmath6 and @xmath7 acting on the energy eigenstates as @xmath8 we can see that these coherent states are defined as eigenstates of @xmath6 and we have @xcite @xmath9 for the harmonic oscillator , we know that the usual coherent states are obtained when @xmath10 , _ ie _ the product of its shifted energies .",
    "second , one way of defining squeezed coherent states is as eigenstates of the operator @xmath11 , so that we get @xcite @xmath12 where now @xmath13 is interestingly a polynomial in a new complex variable obtained from the parameters @xmath3 ( coherence ) and @xmath14 ( squeezing ) ( see section 2 for details ) .",
    "now , for a quantum system which admits a finite discrete spectrum like the one which involves the morse potential , construction of coherent states has been adapted @xcite . in a recent paper @xcite ,",
    "we have used ladder operators @xcite to construct different types of coherent states of the morse potential and we have compared them with the so - called gaussian coherent states @xcite . in particular , such a construction has been inspired by the approach mentioned above ( see the formula ( [ genecs ] ) ) but where the set @xmath15 of values of @xmath2 is now finite .",
    "the coherent states are not exactly eigenstates of the annihilation operator @xmath6 but we have shown @xcite that , in practice , the last term on the right hand side of the sum in ( [ genecs ] ) does not contribute significantly . in some approaches ( see , for example , @xcite ) these states are called pseudo - coherent states .    to our knowledge , squeezed coherent states for the morse potential have not been constructed .",
    "one of the aims of this paper is thus to show that such a construction can be closely related to the one for infinite spectrum systems .",
    "in fact , these states would be almost eigenstates of a linear combination of the ladder operators .",
    "another aim is to investigate the behaviour of those squeezed coherent states with respect to localization , minimal uncertainty relation , quantum noise and also to compare their statistical properties with the ones of the harmonic oscillator system .    in section 2",
    "we give a review of relevant results on squeezed coherent states and minimal uncertainty relations .",
    "starting with the definition of the morse model and its ladder operators , we define , in section 3 , the corresponding squeezed coherent states .",
    "the uncertainty relation , localization , quantum noise and statistical properties of the squeezed states of diatomic molecules are investigated in section 4 , followed by conclusions in section 5 .",
    "in this section we make a review of the construction of squeezed coherent states for quantum systems admitting an infinite discrete spectrum .",
    "these results are well - known and given in many different contributions ( see , for example @xcite ) .",
    "we present them in a summarized and consistent way in order to use them in the next section .",
    "the original development @xcite of coherent states , in the case of the quantum harmonic oscillator , has been closely related to the fact that they minimize the heisenberg uncertainty relation .",
    "indeed , a `` coherent '' superposition of the eigenstates produces minimum uncertainty states with respect to the position operator @xmath16 , and the momentum operator @xmath17 : @xmath18 and , moreover , they satisfy @xmath19 the mean value and dispersion of a given operator @xmath20 are defined , as usual , by @xmath21 for a normalized state @xmath22 describing the evolution of a quantum system .",
    "the harmonic oscillator hamiltonian is given , as usual , by @xmath23 where the coherent states are built as eigenstates of the annihilation operator @xmath24 : @xmath25 they take the explicit form : @xmath26 where the energy eigenstates of the harmonic oscillator are written as : @xmath27 , \\label{hermitefunctions}\\ ] ] and @xmath28 $ ] is the @xmath2th hermite polynomial in @xmath16 .",
    "the ladder operators are defined as @xmath29 and their action on the eigenstates @xmath30 is given by @xmath31 the harmonic oscillator hamiltonian @xmath32 can be factorized as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the number operator defined as @xmath35 .",
    "we have @xmath36",
    "= [ n , a^+]= a^+,\\ [ h_{ho},a^- ] = [ n , a^-]= -a^-\\ ] ] and @xmath37 = i,\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the identity operator .",
    "the set of operators @xmath38 generates the algebra @xmath39 .",
    "the coherent states ( [ csho ] ) are normalizable , continuous in @xmath3 , stable in time , and they verify the resolution of the identity operator .",
    "moreover , they form a complete set of states but they are not orthogonal .    they are also obtained from the action of a `` displacement '' operator @xmath40 on the fundamental energy eigenstate @xmath41 : @xmath42 where @xmath43 which satisfies @xmath44 .",
    "let us note that , in the case of coherent states , due to the relation ( [ murexact ] ) , neither @xmath45 nor @xmath46 tends to zero , so even an ideal laser operating in a pure coherent state will still possess a `` quantum noise '' @xcite",
    ". thus more general classes of minimum uncertainty states are used in quantum optics @xcite where @xmath45 or @xmath47 could tend to zero .",
    "they are known as squeezed states and also referred to as two - photon coherent states @xcite .",
    "they can be constructed as the solutions of the eigenstate equation @xmath48 which is a direct generalization of ( [ cshoequ ] ) .",
    "the mixing of @xmath24 and @xmath49 is said to be controlled by a squeezing parameter ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "these states can thus be called squeezed coherent states because coherent states are special solutions when @xmath50 .",
    "note that @xmath51 for the states to be normalizable .    as a consequence of ( [ scseigenequ ] ) these states",
    "minimize the schrdinger - robertson uncertainty relation @xcite which becomes the usual heisenberg uncertainty one for @xmath14 real .",
    "we get explicitly @xmath52 together with @xmath53 when @xmath54 , we get @xmath55 so that this quantity never reaches its minimum value while if @xmath56 , the dispersions in @xmath16 and @xmath17 now satisfy : @xmath57 making possible the reduction of the `` quantum noise '' on one of the observables with the price of increasing it on the other . in the following , we will treat the case when the quantum noise is reduced on the observable @xmath16 because we will be concerned with a good localization in the position . in some papers , the `` total noise '' has been introduced as @xcite : @xmath58 we thus see that this quantity reaches its minimum value only in the coherent states of the harmonic oscillator .    note that , the eigenvalue equation ( [ scseigenequ ] ) gives us , in terms of the variables @xmath59 , the following solution for the harmonic oscillator squeezed coherent states @xcite : @xmath60 where @xmath61}{\\frac{n!}{i ! ( n - 2 i ) ! } } ( -\\frac{\\gamma}{2})^i { z^{(n - 2 i)}}=(\\frac{\\gamma}{2})^{\\frac{n}{2 } } { \\rm hermite}[n,{\\frac{z}{\\sqrt{2\\gamma } } } ] \\label{scsho - coeff}\\ ] ] and @xmath62 is a constant of normalization given by @xmath63 in ( [ scsho - coeff ] ) , we see that the definition of the hermite polynomials has been extended on @xmath64 .",
    "these polynomials have been shown to have interesting properties in terms of orthogonality , measure and resolution of the identity @xcite .",
    "when @xmath50 , we recover the usual coherent states since @xmath65 . for the squeezed vacuum ( @xmath66 ) , we get @xmath67 the associated states take the form @xmath68 with @xmath69    in the case of squeezed coherent states , let us recall that the probability distribution @xmath70 of the energy eigenstate @xmath71 is explicitly given by @xmath72    it is well - known ( see , for example , @xcite ) , that this is a poisson distribution in the special coherent case ( @xmath50 ) . among other functions ,",
    "mandel s @xmath73-parameter @xcite has been most frequently used to study the statistical properties of those states .",
    "it measures the deviation from the poisson distribution and thus is used to distinguish quantum processes from the classical ones .",
    "@xmath73-parameter is given by , @xmath74 where the dispersion and mean values in @xmath34 are computed in the squeezed coherent states ( [ scs - ho ] ) and can be written as @xmath75 in the case of coherent states ( poisson statistics ) , we know that @xmath76 since it corresponds to the special case where @xmath77 . for @xmath78 , we can have photon bunching ( @xmath79 or super - poissonian statistics ) or antibunching ( @xmath80 or sub - poissonian statistics ) . for the squeeze vacuum ( @xmath66 )",
    ", we have always a super - poissonian statistics .",
    "finally , it is also well - known that the squeezed coherent states for the harmonic oscillator can be obtained from the action of the displacement @xmath81 and squeezed @xmath82 operators on the fundamental state @xmath83 .",
    "more precisely , we get : @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86    since the set of operators @xmath38 generates the algebra @xmath39 , the states solving the eigenstate equation ( [ scseigenequ ] ) will be referred as @xmath39-scs in what follows .      by definition , the schrdinger - robertson uncertainty relation @xcite for two arbitrary hermitian operators @xmath87 and @xmath88 is given as @xmath89 where @xmath90 and @xmath91 are hermitian operators and defined as @xmath92 , \\quad   f = \\bigl\\ {   x - \\langle    x \\rangle   i ,   p - \\langle    p \\rangle   i \\big\\ } ,   \\label{com - rel}\\ ] ] where @xmath93 denotes the anti - commutator .",
    "if @xmath94 , the schrdinger - robertson uncertainty relation reduces to the usual heisenberg uncertainty relation .",
    "a necessary and sufficient condition @xcite for quantum states @xmath95 to minimise the schrdinger - robertson uncertainty relation ( [ relschro ] ) is that @xmath95 solve the eigenstate equation : @xmath96 as a consequence we have also in these states @xmath97 with @xmath98 the states @xmath99 satisfying with @xmath100 are usually called  coherent \" while those with @xmath101 are called  squeezed \" .",
    "let us mention that for @xmath102 , we can see that @xcite @xmath103 when computed in the states @xmath104 and we get @xmath105    for the harmonic oscillator , the squeezed coherent states ( [ scs - ho ] ) are obtained by identifying @xmath87 with @xmath106 and @xmath88 with @xmath107 .",

    "similarly as for the harmonic oscillator , general squeezed coherent states may be now constructed as the solutions of the eigenvalue equation : @xmath113 for a quantum system with an infinite discrete energy spectrum @xmath114 .",

    "in fact for @xmath124 or @xmath125 algebras , @xmath115 is a quadratic function of @xmath2 .",

    ", we get a 3-term recurrence relation @xmath132 without restriction , we take @xmath133 and thus @xmath134 .",
    "the resolution of such a recurrence relation is given in the appendix where we have taken the function @xmath135 which will be used in section 3 for the morse system .",
    "the solution is thus shown to be related to hypergeometric functions of type @xmath136 .",
    "let us mention that independently of the expression of @xmath115 , the solution @xmath137 is a polynomial in @xmath3 of degree @xmath2 .",
    "indeed , it is easy to show that @xmath137 could be written as @xmath138    let us end this section by mentioning that , in those squeezed coherent states , we have now , for @xmath14 real : @xmath139 since here the operator @xmath140 is given by @xmath141=[a^-,a^+].\\ ] ]    the operators @xmath87 and @xmath88 are not the position and momentum operators except for the case of the harmonic oscillator . in general , they involve those operators in a complicated way .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the morse potential system constitutes a better approximation of vibrations of atoms in a diatomic molecule .",
    "the new system is still very close to the harmonic oscillator .",
    "thus , the squeezed coherent states will be constructed following the procedure given for the harmonic oscillator , except that we will deal with a finite number of eigenstates .",
    "we will show that the states constructed in this way will thus be well localized for some values of the coherent and squeezing parameters .",
    "the one - dimensional morse model is given by the energy eigenvalue equation ( see , for example , @xcite ) @xmath142 where @xmath143 is the reduced mass of the oscillating system composed of two atoms of masses @xmath144 and @xmath145 , _ i.e. _ @xmath146 .",
