    "the origin of type ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) has important implications for understanding the physics of these dramatic explosions , the evolution of binary stars , and the expansion of the universe .",
    "recent interest in this last issue is particularly high because sne  ia are the most effective distance indicators known on cosmological scales .",
    "these objects are thus the focus of many current and future dark - energy experiments ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "investigating systematics that could affect their luminosity evolution in any way is a prerequisite for precision cosmological studies using sne  ia as calibratable standard candles .",
    "perhaps the most serious gap in our understanding of sne  ia is our lack of knowledge about their progenitor systems .",
    "it is widely thought that sne  ia occur in close binary systems @xcite , in which a carbon - oxygen white dwarf accretes matter from another star until it nears the @xcite mass and its core ignites a thermonuclear explosion that propagates outward and destroys the white dwarf .",
    "the identity of the companion star , however , is unknown ; possibilities range from a second white dwarf ( a double - degenerate system ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to a main - sequence star , subgiant , or evolved red giant ( all single - degenerate systems ) . at best",
    ", these proposed progenitor systems would have an absolute magnitude of @xmath8 ( for a red giant companion star near the tip of the red giant branch ) , leaving them undetectable by current telescopes for all but the closest galaxies .",
    "since the last known local group sn  ia occurred in 1885 @xcite and there have been no sne  ia observed in the milky way in over 400 years @xcite , direct empirical constraints on the nature of the progenitors are severely lacking .",
    "recent observations , however , have yielded progress on this issue using several different approaches .",
    "first , statistical studies of large numbers of sn host galaxies have demonstrated a strong relationship between hubble type and the rate of type ia supernovae , with late - type galaxies hosting as many as 20 times more sne  ia per unit mass as early - type galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this result suggests that many sne  ia come from a relatively young stellar population , although of course the sne  ia in elliptical galaxies must have their origin in an older population .",
    "these observations , combined with the sn  ia rate as a function of redshift , can be used to derive the delay - time distribution ( the amount of time between the formation of a stellar population and the occurrence of sne  ia ) .",
    "the measured delay - time distribution includes both a prompt ( @xmath9  yr ) component that is closely associated with recent star formation and a much more extended component with a characteristic timescale of several gyr ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* although see @xcite for a conflicting view ) .",
    "these two distinct components of the sn  ia population would seem to naturally correspond to different mechanisms for producing type ia supernovae , and perhaps different progenitor systems as well .",
    "supporting this idea , a number of studies have demonstrated that sne  ia in early - type and late - type galaxies have different average luminosities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ".    detailed studies of individual nearby sne  ia have also revealed crucial clues .",
    "@xcite found unusual behavior of the velocity of the  @xmath10 line in the otherwise normal sn  2005hj and argued that this object might be the prototype of a separate class of sn  ia explosions .",
    "@xcite obtained spectra of stars near the center of the remnant of tycho s supernova ( sn  1572 ) and claimed to identify the companion star to the sn progenitor , a g - type subgiant , although this interpretation has proved controversial ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "finally , another recent advance has been made by @xcite , who detected circumstellar material ( csm ) in a sn  ia via optical absorption lines for the first time .",
    "previous searches for emission from csm in sne  ia using , radio , and x - ray observations have generally yielded only upper limits @xcite , with the exception of a few unusual objects whose classification as sne  ia has been disputed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* but see @xcite and @xcite for alternative interpretations ) .",
    "by obtaining high - resolution spectra of sn  2006x at multiple epochs , @xcite showed that the strength of at least four distinct components of the na  i  d absorption lines varied with time .",
    "the temporal coverage of the data was rather sparse , but the variability occurred over the time span between 2 days before maximum light and 61 days after .",
    "similar rapid changes in metal absorption - line profiles with time are commonly seen in novae and provide clues to the mass - transfer process in those systems @xcite .",
    "variable na  d absorption is also observed in the spectra of milky way stars ( generally on timescales of years to decades , although observations on shorter timescales are lacking ) and is usually attributed to small interstellar clouds moving perpendicular to the line of sight ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the lack of corresponding variability in the h & k absorption features in sn  2006x , however , renders this interpretation viable only with an appeal to peculiar chemical abundances and/or an unusual geometry in the absorbing interstellar clouds .",
    "accordingly , @xcite concluded that the variable absorption features originate in _ circumstellar _ clouds in the progenitor system that were ionized by the radiation from the supernova and recombined over the following several weeks , with some of the clouds then being collisionally reionized by the sn ejecta at later times .",
    "this circumstellar gas could have originated either in the stellar wind from the progenitor s companion star or in successive nova eruptions . because has a much lower ionization potential than",
    ", the na  d line profiles can change without an accompanying effect in the ca  h & k lines if the ionizing radiation has an appropriate spectrum .",
    "the @xcite interpretation has been challenged by @xcite , who showed that for typical red giant wind densities na  d absorption should not be detectable .",
    "@xcite suggested instead that the absorbing material must be located farther away from the supernova , possibly not associated with the progenitor system at all .",
    "photometry and late - time low - resolution spectroscopy of sn  2006x , which reveal at least one light echo from the supernova , also provide support for a dusty circumstellar environment @xcite .",
    "taken as a whole , these results appear to indicate a single - degenerate progenitor for sn  2006x , perhaps with a red giant companion .    but is sn  2006x merely a unique , pathological object ?",
    "or is it broadly representative of a significant fraction of ( or perhaps all ) sne  ia ?",
    "@xcite have now identified a second supernova , sn  1999cl , displaying variable na  d absorption that is visible even at low spectral resolution , but the lack of high - resolution data or coverage of the ca h & k lines makes the interpretation of this object more difficult .",
    "the @xcite analysis demonstrates that significant changes in the na  d absorption profile are relatively uncommon , with only two detections out of 31 sne examined .",
    "notably , sn  1999cl and sn  2006x are the two most heavily reddened supernovae in the @xcite sample , creating the appearance of a connection between large ( presumably interstellar ) reddening and variable absorption .    only two other sne  ia ( sn  2000cx and sn  2007af ) have multi - epoch high - resolution spectra available in the literature , and",
    "neither of those objects exhibits any changes in the na  d line profiles with time @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present a similar data set for the bright sn  ia  2007le , including six high - resolution spectra obtained between @xmath11 and @xmath12 days relative to maximum light .",
    "we use these data to test the @xcite scenario , searching for variability in the na  d absorption features .",
    "we describe all of our observations , both photometric and spectroscopic , in   [ observations ] . in   [ results ] , we compare the light curve and spectral evolution of sn  2007le with those of other sne  ia and analyze the high - resolution spectra .",

    "we do not have uv photometry of sn  2007le , but to the degree that uv light curves of sne  ia are fairly homogeneous @xcite , it is reasonable to substitute another similar sn .",

    "this assumption means that the calculations are not explicitly time dependent , but we do not expect non - equilibrium effects to produce qualitative changes in the results discussed below .",
    "we also note that , while at longer uv wavelengths the model can be compared to observed spectra for validation , at the critical far - uv wavelengths that ionize hydrogen no such comparison with real data is possible .",
    "@xcite have recently carried out very similar calculations to investigate the possibility of detecting csm interactions in spectra obtained before maximum light .",
    "guided by the hypothesis that recombination is responsible for the varying column density , a few iterations of the model demonstrate that very large hydrogen densities are needed to produce significant na recombination ( for a solar abundance ratio ) .",

    "the results are illustrated in figure [ cloudymodel ] . for distances greater than @xmath5  pc",
    "the fraction of ions is essentially constant with time , while the fraction increases by approximately an order of magnitude over a time span of 30 days .",
    "closer to the sn , the ca becomes more highly ionized ( and the fraction varies with time ) and the amount of neutral na is negligible , supporting the idea that the source of the absorption must be located at distances larger than @xmath164  cm .    over the range of parameter space where these calculations indicate that the column density will vary and the column density will not , the ew of the na  d@xmath44 line is predicted to be less than or equal to the ew of the ca  k line . at distances of less than 1  pc , the ca absorption should be @xmath165 times as strong as the na absorption .",
    "yet , we observe that ew@xmath166 is _ larger _ than ew@xmath167 at all epochs ( see tables [ na_ew ] and [ ca_ew ] and fig .",
    "[ highresspectra_ca ] ) .",
    "if the model described above is correct , we therefore require that nearly all of the ca atoms in the csm are locked up in dust grains , as is also typical in dense interstellar clouds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the immediate vicinity of a supernova ,",
    "the destruction of dust grains is obviously a possibility .",
    "however , given sublimation temperatures of @xmath168  k for silicate and carbonaceous grains @xcite , calculations of grain temperatures with cloudy using the dust grain model of @xcite indicate that dust can survive at distances greater than 0.05  pc ( unshaded region in fig .",
    "[ cloudymodel ] ) over the relevant time period .",
    "the results presented in   [ cloudy ] point to distances of @xmath5  pc for the absorbing material .",
    "figure [ cloudymodel ] demonstrates that the ew of the absorption would remain constant for distances as small as @xmath169  pc , but the fraction of neutral sodium so close to the supernova is negligible .",
    "distances greater than 1  pc are also allowed by the photoionization modeling , but then the ionization fraction is very low ( as a result of the weak uv field ) , requiring extremely high physical densities to produce large numbers of electrons .",
    "of course , at such distances the galactic uv field may contribute significantly to the photoionization rate , rendering our calculations no longer applicable . at @xmath170",
    "pc , the gas temperature is @xmath171  k , and densities of @xmath172  @xmath4 are required to produce significant na recombination .",
    "with such a high density , substantial amounts of dust could be present , and strong depletion of ca atoms onto dust grains would explain the large observed ratio of to .",
    "given the derived density and a solar na abundance of 12 + log(na / h)@xmath173 @xcite , the total density of na atoms is @xmath174  @xmath4 .",
    "the fraction under these conditions is @xmath175 , yielding @xmath176  @xmath4 . in order to obtain a column density of @xmath177  @xmath1 , as derived in   [ conditions ] , the path length through the absorbing cloud must be @xmath178  cm .",
    "if such a clump of material were roughly spherical its mass could be quite small ( @xmath179  m@xmath126 ) , but a clump of radius @xmath180  cm at a distance of @xmath181  cm would only occult a small fraction of the sn photosphere ( radius @xmath182  cm ) after maximum light and thus could not be responsible for an absorption line as deep as that observed in figure  [ highresspectra ] . in order to produce a covering fraction closer to unity , there must either be large numbers of small clumps , or perhaps a larger sheet of material with perpendicular dimensions of @xmath183  cm ( the rather high densities involved probably rule out the full spherical shell model proposed by @xcite ) .",
    "the total csm mass along the line of sight ( presumably more csm is present in other directions ) would then be in the range of @xmath184  m@xmath126 depending on the geometry .",
    "is it plausible for such a cloud ( or clouds ) to exist in the sn progenitor system ?",
    "the measured velocity of the variable absorbing component is 2123  km  s@xmath14 , while the local host galaxy ism velocity near the position of the sn is @xmath185  km  s@xmath14 . assuming that the velocity measured for the local ism is representative of the progenitor system , then the variable absorption component has a line - of - sight velocity of @xmath131  km  s@xmath14  relative to the progenitor itself . at a constant velocity of 10  km  s@xmath14 ,",
    "material starting near the center of the progenitor system would take @xmath186  yr to reach a radius of 0.1  pc , but factoring in the gravitational deceleration the actual travel time would be @xmath187  yr if the material originated in the red giant wind or @xmath131  yr if it was blown off from the white dwarf ( which requires a much higher initial velocity ) .",
    "regardless , this timescale is certainly far shorter than the age of the progenitor system or its evolutionary timescale , so _ producing _ csm at such distances does not appear to be problematic .",
    "the _ survival _ of dense clumps similar to what we are proposing here , though , may be an issue : the thermal pressure in such a cloud is quite large , suggesting that the cloud should expand and dissipate on timescales of decades unless the average csm pressure is also very high .",
    "we do not currently have enough information to determine whether such clumps of material could form from the wind of the companion alone , the interaction of the wind with surrounding material , or a nova eruption on the surface of the white dwarf .",
    "we have presented a series of high - resolution spectra of the nearby type ia supernova sn  2007le , a normal sn  ia in the subgroup that exhibits broad lines and high velocity gradients , similar to sn  2002bo and sn  2006x .",
    "the spectra reveal a complex set of absorption systems in the na  d and ca  h & k lines .",
    "our observations demonstrate that one of the na absorption components changes systematically with time , increasing its equivalent width by 85  m  from maximum light to three months later .",
    "sn  2007le is the third sn  ia in which this effect has been seen , after sn  2006x @xcite and sn  1999cl @xcite . as in sn  2006x , we detect no variations in the absorption column over the course of our observations .    in the initial study of sn  2006x , @xcite modeled the varying absorption as occurring in several shells of circumstellar gas resulting either from the stellar wind of the companion to the supernova progenitor ( presumed to be a red giant ) or recurrent nova eruptions .",
    "subsequently , @xcite argued that the red giant wind scenario could only reproduce the observed behavior with an unrealistically high wind density .",
    "@xcite did note that a red giant wind plus a dense clump or shell of material might be compatible with the observed and optical depths , but concluded that this solution was unlikely because of the difficulty of creating a sufficiently dense shell .",
    "moreover , both sn  2006x and sn  1999cl were extremely heavily reddened , suggesting the possibility of a connection between variable absorption and properties of the interstellar medium along the line of sight .",
    "the much lower extinction toward sn  2007le demonstrates that variable absorption also occurs in supernovae that are not seen through an unusually dense , dusty ism .",
    "conversely , it is now also clear that some highly obscured objects such as sn  2003cg @xcite and sn  2008fp ( patat et al . , in preparation ) do not exhibit variable absorption .",
    "we therefore carried out further photoionization calculations to investigate whether circumstellar material could explain the varying na and constant ca absorption profiles . using a synthetic uv spectrum for a sn  ia",
    ", we found that a small ( @xmath180  cm ) , dense ( @xmath3  @xmath4 ) clump or clumps of material located @xmath5  pc away from the explosion can provide the necessary column density and ionization changes with time to account for the observations . in order to reproduce the observed to ew ratio , this model requires a very large fraction of the ca atoms to be depleted onto dust grains .",
    "the most likely origin for gas so close to the supernova is that it was produced in the progenitor system .",
    "if this explanation is correct , the results indicate a single - degenerate progenitor system for sn  2007le , in accord with previous suggestions for sn  2006x .    through the work of @xcite and our own high - resolution spectroscopy of additional sne  ia ( to be described in future papers ) , it is clear that the fraction of sn  ia events that show the variable na signature is relatively small ( as predicted by @xcite for the recurrent nova scenario ) .",
    "in light of this rarity , it is noteworthy that all three of the sne displaying variable absorption share common features in their early - time and maximum - light spectra , classifying them in the broad line group according to @xcite and the high velocity gradient group of ( * ? ? ? * although the hvg classification of sn  2007le is less firm ) . with these groups comprising @xmath188% of sne  ia , the odds of three sne exhibiting both variable absorption and broad lines / high velocity gradients by chance ( i.e.",
    ", if there is no physical connection between the two ) is low .",
    "our observations of sn  2007le therefore support earlier speculations of a relationship between high velocity gradients and variable na absorption .    these results still leave open the three explanations for variable absorption proposed in the literature : ( 1 ) sne with high velocity gradients and variable absorption occur in a distinct progenitor system or with a different explosion mechanism than other sne  ia ; ( 2 ) sne with high velocity gradients and variable absorption occur in the same progenitor systems as other sne  ia , but with a peculiar geometry that yields higher observed velocities and makes variable absorption more likely ; or ( 3 ) variable absorption is simply a line - of - sight effect that is independent of the properties of the supernova itself .",
    "if the variable absorption originates in the ism , then it is much more likely to be observed for objects that are seen through large ism columns .",
    "the low extinction of sn  2007le , suggesting that it is not obscured by a substantial amount of ism material , renders the third possibility less likely .",
    "further high - resolution spectroscopy of bl / hvg sne will be needed to continue investigating the first two scenarios and reveal whether high velocity gradients are a sufficient condition for variable na absorption or merely a necessary one .",
    "it is also worth noting that in all three sne with variable absorption , the absorption lines are systematically blueshifted with respect to the local ism velocity , further pointing to a connection between the absorbing material and the supernovae themselves .",
    "in addition to variable na absorption , we also detect  emission in the spectrum of sn  2007le , possibly originating from the supernova itself . the narrow  emission line ( fwhm  @xmath189  km  s@xmath14 ) is spatially unresolved , coincident with the position of the supernova , and at a slightly different velocity than the surrounding diffuse interstellar emission .",
    "the amount of hydrogen that would need to be present in the circumstellar environment to produce the observed emission luminosity is @xmath190  m@xmath126 .",
    "this feature is present at all high - resolution spectroscopic epochs , but as a result of its small equivalent width is not visible in any of the low - resolution spectra .",
    "the emission - line flux is constant within the uncertainties through 12 days after maximum light , but possibly strengthens in the observations obtained several months later . in the best of our spectra , h@xmath121 , [ ] , and [ ] lines",
    "are also detected , but interestingly [ ] is not , suggesting a very low excitation for the ionized gas .",
    "if the increase in the  flux with time is real , then the emitting gas must be associated with the supernova , but further observations at late times after the sn has faded will be needed to confirm or reject this possibility .",
