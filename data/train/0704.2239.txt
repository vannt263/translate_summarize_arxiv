    "the reionization epoch  when the hydrogen in the universe was ionized by photons produced in the first galaxies  remains one of the least explored periods in cosmology .",
    "there is substantial uncertainty as to when reionization occurred .",
    "the latest cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) data show that the mean redshift of reionization was @xmath9 , but are consistent with @xmath10 at 3-@xmath7 @xcite , and measurements of ly@xmath0 absorption in the spectra of high - redshift quasars suggest that reionization ended at @xmath11 @xcite .    whether observations have already pinned down the redshift of bubble percolation to be @xmath11 using the ly@xmath0 absorption features in the spectra of high - redshift quasars ",
    "the ly@xmath0 forest  is under debate .",
    "the appearance of gunn - peterson absorption troughs in the @xmath12 ly@xmath0 forest may signify a change in the ionization state of the intergalactic medium @xcite .",
    "in addition , the rapid decrease of ly@xmath0 forest transmission at @xmath12 ( as well as the decrease in transmission in the ly@xmath13 and the ly@xmath14 forests ) , the large variance in the transmission between sight - lines , and the sizes of the proximity regions around @xmath15 qsos may also indicate that reionization is ending ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , owing to the resonant nature of the ly@xmath0 line , ly@xmath0 transmission is essentially zero if the gas is more neutral than one part in a thousand , which makes the ly@xmath0 forest insensitive to the order unity fluctuations in the ionized fraction that define reionization . because of this limitation ,",
    "arguments for the end of reionization based on the forest are controversial .",
    "@xcite proposed that the rapid evolution of ly@xmath0 transmission in the @xmath11 forest is consistent with an ionized intergalactic medium ( igm ) . @xcite and @xcite showed that the observed variance in the transmission between sight - lines is consistent with the variance one expects from an ionized igm , and @xcite and @xcite demonstrated that current data can not distinguish the proximity region owing to enhanced ionizing flux from the effect of an hii region .",
    "high - redshift qsos will probably not reveal additional information about reionization in the next few years , as all - sky surveys that observe in the near - infrared are required to push to higher redshifts .",
    "the ly@xmath0 forest in the spectrum of high - redshift gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) holds more immediate promise , but the presence of damped ly@xmath0 systems within grb host galaxies complicates the determination of the ionization state of the igm . despite this difficulty , through measurements of the ly@xmath0 and the ly@xmath13 forests in the spectrum of a single grb , @xcite derived the constraint @xmath16 at @xmath17 , assuming a uniformly ionized igm , where @xmath18 is the global ionized fraction of the igm .",
    "accounting for a patchy reionization process will weaken this limit .",
    "observations of high - redshift 21 cm emission have the potential to put the strongest constraints on @xmath18 in the long term . in principle",
    ", such studies can image the neutral hydrogen in the universe as it became ionized .",
    "however , 21 cm observations must first overcome terrestrial radio broadcasts as well as galactic foregrounds that are four orders of magnitude larger than the signal ( e.g. , @xcite ) . despite these difficulties , the mileura widefield array and",
    "the low frequency array will start dedicated observations of this emission in the coming years @xcite , and the 21 cm array and the giant meter - wave radio telescope are already being used to perform these measurements @xcite .",
    "studies of the cmb will never be able to provide a direct detection of reionization by imaging individual hii regions .",
    "however , measurements of cmb anisotropies can improve constraints on the global properties of reionization .",
    "a more precise measurement of cmb polarization anisotropies at low multipoles has the potential to provide some information about the duration of reionization in addition to tighter constraints on the average redshift of reionization ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the _ planck _",
    "mission will measure the large - scale e - mode polarization anisotropies to nearly the cosmic - variance limit in the next few years .",
    "in addition , a sizable fraction of arc - minute - scale cmb anisotropies are imprinted during patchy reionization @xcite , and the atacama cosmology telescope and the south pole telescope are starting to observe these anisotropies .",
    "these observations have the potential to provide information about the duration of reionization and about the sizes of the hii regions .    in this paper",
    ", we demonstrate that ly@xmath0 emitter ( lae ) surveys will likely offer the first irrefutable proof as to precisely when reionization occurred , at least if the universe is significantly neutral for @xmath19 as the high - redshift quasars suggest .",
    "we show that the @xmath3 lae sample from subaru can already put limits on @xmath18 with just @xmath2 photometrically confirmed laes .",
    "surveys on existing telescopes will also put constraints on the neutral fraction at higher redshifts , and the james webb space telescope ( jwst )  with the appropriate observing strategy  will effectively be able to image hii regions during reionization .",
    "there are several surveys that have targeted or are targeting laes at epochs when the universe may have been significantly neutral ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and other programs will begin taking data soon ( e.g. , @xcite ) . these surveys take advantage of the fact that a galaxy can produce a sizable fraction of its flux in the ly@xmath0 line @xcite .",
    "the transmission of the ly@xmath0 line from a galaxy is decreased if the neighborhood of an emitter is largely neutral , and this modulation can be used to probe the epoch of reionization @xcite .",
    "most previous theoretical studies of high - redshift laes have focused on using the evolution in the lae luminosity function or in the average ly@xmath0 line profile to constrain reionization .",
    "the first predictions for the impact of reionization on the lae luminosity function and line profile were based on the assumption that each emitter sits in its own hii region until the final bubble percolation stage , at which time all of the hii regions quickly merge and reionization is completed @xcite . in reality",
    ", the hii regions can be much larger throughout reionization than this simple model predicts owing to the clustering of high - redshift sources ( e.g. , @xcite ) . when the universe has @xmath20 , typically a lae will be in an hii region created by thousands of galaxies .",
    "because of this clustering , both the evolution of the lae luminosity function and the change in the shape of the average line profile of an emitter are a weaker function of the neutral fraction than predicted by models based on a single source per hii region @xcite .",
    "the measured @xmath21 lae luminosity function has already been used to constrain @xmath18 .",
    "@xcite argued that the data is consistent with no evolution in the luminosity function between @xmath22 and @xmath21 , and this lack of evolution allowed @xcite to derive the limit @xmath23 at @xmath24 .",
    "however , in the newest and largest lae survey at @xmath12 , @xcite finds significant evolution between the @xmath25 and the @xmath26 luminosity functions for luminosities @xmath27 erg s@xmath28 , and they suggest that this evolution could be evidence for reionization .",
    "furthermore , @xcite finds that the number density of laes with luminosities above @xmath29 erg s@xmath28 at @xmath30 is @xmath31 smaller than this number density at @xmath3 .",
    "in addition to the luminosity function and the ly@xmath0 line profile , the hii bubbles will influence the _ measured _ clustering of laes @xcite .",
    "detecting reionization through its impact on observed clustering will be the most fool - proof method to identify pockets of neutral hydrogen in the igm with laes , since astrophysical uncertainties and observational systematics can not induce large - scale correlations similar to @xmath32 hii regions during reionization .",
    "we show that a lae survey using clustering measurements can confirm whether reionization is occurring at @xmath3 in the immediate future and that upcoming surveys will place constraints on reionization at higher redshifts .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ calculations ] , we describe the simulations of reionization that we employ as well as the post - processing calculations used to generate mock ly@xmath0 surveys from the simulation outputs .",
    "these mock lae surveys are featured in section [ lae ] .",
    "the effect of reionization on the luminosity function is discussed in section [ lumfunc ] ( and on the line profile in appendix [ lineprofile ] ) .",
    "however , the primary focus of this work is to investigate the impact that reionization has on the measured clustering properties of laes and to quantify the detectability of reionization - induced clustering in present surveys ( section [ clustering ] and , for void statistics , appendix [ voids ] ) .",
    "we conclude in section [ surveys ] with a discussion of the capabilities of upcoming lae surveys to constrain reionization .",
    "we use two @xmath33 n - body simulations generated with the treepm code l - gadget-2 @xcite to model the density field , one in a box of size @xmath34 with outputs every @xmath35 myr and the other in a box of size @xmath36 with outputs every @xmath37 myr . a friends - of - friends algorithm with a linking length of @xmath38 times the mean inter - particle spacing is used to identify halos .",
    "we employ the higher - resolution @xmath34 box to study line properties .",
    "this box is run using a @xmath39cdm cosmology with @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 , consistent with the first year wmap results @xcite .",
    "we use the @xmath46 box to study the luminosity function and clustering properties of emitters .",
    "this volume provides a larger sample of the structures that are present during reionization than does the smaller box .",
    "the @xmath46 box is run with a @xmath39cdm cosmology updated to be more consistent with the latest wmap results @xcite with @xmath40 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath45 .",
    "the assumptions about the cosmology do not significantly affect the morphology of reionization if we compare at fixed @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the halo mass function measured from the n - body simulations matches the @xcite mass function for groups with 32 or more particles .",
    "thirty - two particle groups correspond to a halo mass of @xmath51 in the @xmath34 box and @xmath52 in the @xmath36 box .",
    "we would like to resolve halos down to the atomic hydrogen cooling mass @xmath53  halos with virial temperature of @xmath54 k  which corresponds to the minimum mass galaxy that can form stars ( @xmath55 at @xmath56 ) .",
    "we add unresolved halos ( halos that would be comprised of fewer than 32 particles ) into the simulation using a press - schechter merger tree .",
    "this algorithm is similar to the pthalo method for generating mock catalogs of galaxies @xcite , and accounts for both density and poisson fluctuations in the abundance of halos .",
    "we demonstrate in @xcite that this method reproduces well the power spectrum and mass function of dark matter halos seen in simulations .",
    "we use an improved version of the @xcite and @xcite radiative transfer code .",
    "we have refined the algorithm to group sources more efficiently for our work , and this improvement is discussed in appendix [ code ] . our approach is optimized to simulate reionization , making several justified simplifications to speed up the computation .",
    "the code takes the gridded density field ( generated from the n - body simulation assuming that the baryons trace the dark matter ) and a list of the ionizing sources as input , and it casts rays from each source to compute the ionization field .",
    "we assume that the sources have a soft uv spectrum that scales as @xmath57 ( consistent with a popii imf ) , which is used to calculate the photo - ionization state of the gas .",
    "the radiative transfer code assumes perfectly sharp hii fronts , tracking the front position at subgrid scales .",
    "sharp fronts are an excellent approximation for sources with a soft uv spectrum , where the mean free path for ionizing photons is kiloparsecs , substantially smaller than the cell size in the radiative transfer calculations .",
    "the radiative transfer calculations presented in this paper were performed on a @xmath58 grid for the @xmath59 box and on a @xmath60 grid for the @xmath61 box .",
    "the radiative transfer calculations took between three days and two weeks on a @xmath62 ghz amd opteron processor .      the shape and energetics of a ly@xmath0 line from a galaxy",
    "are determined by complex processes , many of which can not be modeled accurately .",
    "the ly@xmath0 emission depends on the amount of dust in the galaxy , the velocity profile of the gas in the halo , and the fraction of ionizing photons that escape from the galaxy and influence the photo - ionization state of the nearby igm @xcite .",
    "statistics that can be used to isolate the effect that reionization has on the emitters from all of the complicated , uncertain astrophysics are essential to probe reionization with laes . in order to construct mock surveys from which we can measure various statistics , we must make simplifying assumptions about the ly@xmath0 emission that escapes from the vicinity of a galaxy .    to calculate the emitter line profile and its transmission we employ two schemes , a detailed , expensive method and a fast , relatively inexpensive technique .",
    "_ method 1 _ : we assume a gaussian intrinsic line profile  the line profile that escapes from the vicinity of the galaxy  with its width set by the circular velocity at the virial radius of the emitter host halo ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "this intrinsic line profile is what is commonly assumed in the literature ( e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) , but the outgoing line can be significantly more complicated @xcite .",
    "see the discussion in appendix [ lineprofile ] for the physical motivation for the assumed line profile . in the absence of a galactic wind",
    ", we assume the intrinsic line is centered at ly@xmath0 .",
    "given the intrinsic line from an emitter , we compute the absorption along a skewer through the simulation box , using the density , velocity , and photo - ionization state of the gas . the radiative transfer simulations",
    "do not compute the temperature of the gas self - consistently . for simplicity , we take the gas in all regions to be at @xmath64 .",
    "the value of the gas temperature and the amplitude of the sub - grid - scale density fluctuations do not influence the amount of damping wing absorption  the effect that is most relevant to this study .    _ method 2 _ : first , we set the residual neutral fraction within each hii region to zero .",
    "the residual neutral gas primarily influences frequencies blueward of ly@xmath0 , which this method assumes are fully absorbed .",
    "next , we calculate the damping wing optical depth to absorption @xmath65 along a ray through the igm , ignoring the effect of peculiar velocities . we do this for only a single frequency that starts off at @xmath66 for each source , where @xmath67 is the line center and @xmath68 is the wind velocity ( which is typically taken to be zero ) .",

    "the exact value of @xmath70 or its scaling with halo mass is not important for our present study since @xmath70 is degenerate with the luminosity of the emitter prior to absorption in the igm , @xmath73 .",
    "this method is in contrast to method 1 in which for each source we calculate @xmath65 at many different frequencies .",
    "it turns out that both methods for computing the line profile result in very similar results .",
    "( see figure [ fig : trans ] for a comparison of the two methods . )",
    "the agreement between the two methods occurs because for observed emitters the virial velocity of the halo , which sets the intrinsic width of the line in our model , is typically much smaller than the relative velocity between the lae and the hii front .",
    "the agreement between the two methods justifies the use of the cheaper method , method 2 , for computations in which the shape of the line profile is not required .    for reference ,",
    "the radius of a bubble that produces a damping wing absorption cross section of unity at source - frame frequency @xmath74 is @xcite @xmath75 where pmpc denotes proper mpc , @xmath76 is the neutral fraction outside of the bubble , and @xmath77 is the redshift of a lae in the center of the bubble . equation ( [ eqn : rbub ] ) is correct in detail only for a homogeneous @xmath78 . in practice ,",
    "the igm is far from uniform and the effective @xmath76 along each line of sight is not equal to the globally averaged @xmath76 .",
    "also note that @xmath79^{3/2}\\,[h(z_g ) r_b - c \\,(\\nu- \\nu_0)/\\nu_0]^{-1}$ ]  the optical depth scales inversely with the bubble radius .",
    "( see @xcite for the exact expression for @xmath80 as a function of the bubble size . )",
    "if a lae produces its own hii bubble then the size of this bubble is @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the star formation rate , which is estimated to be approximately @xmath83-@xmath84 yr@xmath28 for observed emitters @xcite , and @xmath85 is the lifetime of the emitter .",

    "note that typically @xmath87 for an emitter that sits in an hii region created entirely by itself .",
    "in cdm theory , high redshift galaxies are very clustered such that the situation of a single source creating an hii region is a rarity .",
    "given the methods discussed in section [ rt ] for calculating the line profile , we also need an algorithm that tells us where the laes are located to generate mock surveys . for the analysis in this paper , we adopt a simple model to populate the halos in the simulation with laes . we describe a mock survey of laes with three parameters :    * @xmath88  minimum mass halo that hosts an observed lae * @xmath89  fraction of halos that host laes * @xmath90  fraction of the lae sample contaminated by lower - redshift interlopers    we assume that each halo in the simulation box has at most one lae , which is reasonable at @xmath12 since the gas cooling time in all halos is shorter than a hubble time .",

    "we ignore peculiar velocities in our analysis .",
    "peculiar velocities most significantly affect fourier modes oriented along the line of sight .",
    "in narrow - band lae surveys , the majority of the signal is instead contributed by transverse , long wavelength modes .",

    "a reasonable estimate is @xmath102 in present surveys .",

    "the uniform suppression of the luminosity function was also found in the analytic studies of @xcite .",
    "the explanation provided in @xcite for this uniform suppression is that the most massive ( most biased ) sources sit in the largest bubbles , which results in the least attenuation of their ly@xmath0 line .",

    "therefore , the range of @xmath88 that we have considered spans much of the relevant parameter space for @xmath13 .",
    "the calculations in this section were aimed at understanding the sensitivity to reionization of widefield surveys at @xmath26 that have already been completed or will be finished this coming year .",
    "these surveys constitute a small fraction of the total subaru observing time in a year .",

    "we have shown that if the universe is largely neutral at @xmath334 , observations like those being done on subaru should be able to study the modulation from the hii regions .",
    "what is the prospect for upcoming surveys to detect reionization at @xmath335 ? to answer this question , we concentrate on three instruments : ( 1 ) the dark ages z ly@xmath0 explorer ( dazle ) , which has started observing on the very large telescope ( vlt ) , ( 2 ) the configurable multi - slit spectrograph mosfire ( _ the multi - object spectrograph for infra - red exploration _ ) to be commissioned on the keck telescope in 2009 , and ( 3 ) nirspec on jwst .",
    "these represent some of the most promising instruments to target high - redshift laes .",
    "upcoming instruments take different approaches to identify high - redshift laes .",
    "dazle uses two @xmath336 , overlapping narrow band filters in a @xmath337 fov .",
    "differencing these filters makes it possible to subtract out continuum sources , leaving just the broad - line sources .",
    "the effective volume for dazle in a single pointing is @xmath338 , or @xmath339 of the volume of the sdf observations .",
    "however , dazle s flux sensitivity is below that of other narrow band surveys because of its extremely narrow filters .",
    "mosfire uses the magnification bias of cluster lensing caustics to improve the sensitivity to high - redshift laes by as much as a factor of @xmath35 .",
    "mosfire is capable of simultaneously taking spectra from @xmath340 slits , each @xmath341 in length . for an @xmath342 hr observation of @xmath277 clusters , @xcite estimate",
    "that these surveys could cover an effective volume of @xmath342 mpc@xmath343 distributed between @xmath344  much smaller than the volume of narrow band samples .",
    "however , whereas dazle will be sensitive to @xmath345 at @xmath56 , mosfire can measure line fluxes of lensed galaxies which have @xmath346 in a @xmath195 hr exposure .    with the launch of jwst in 2013 , the nirspec instrument ( capable of simultaneously taking spectra of @xmath196 objects in a @xmath347 fov ) will be sensitive to ly@xmath0 luminosities that are over an order of magnitude smaller than terrestrial narrow band surveys and comparable to the effective sensitivity of a mosfire caustic survey .",
    "jwst will use the imaging camera nircam to select high - redshift galaxies with the lyman break technique , and follow up with nirspec to select laes .",
    "this selection strategy will facilitate cross correlation studies to isolate the bubble - induced fluctuations ( as discussed in section [ clustering ] ) and allow 3-d tomography of laes .",
    "see figure [ fig : maps2 ] for a mock survey of laes that has a jwst - like sensitivity . however , a survey with jwst that has the same area as the panels in figure [ fig : maps2 ] would in fact require over @xmath196 different pointings of both nircam and nirspec to cover this @xmath348 sq .",

    "arc - min .",
    "region @xcite .    in general , it is difficult to make predictions for the statistical significance with which upcoming instruments can detect reionization at @xmath349 owing to all of the uncertainties in the source properties and their evolution .",
    "as we have seen , there is substantial uncertainty in the @xmath3 luminosity function .",
    "the extrapolation of this luminosity function to higher redshifts depends sensitively on , for example , the typical halo mass of laes .",
    "if @xmath350 in current lae surveys ( such that the observed laes are in the most massive halos ) , then the luminosity function will evolve more quickly with redshift than if @xmath351 .",
    "unfortunately , the parameter @xmath89 is not constrained to even an order of magnitude by the @xmath111 data @xcite .",
    "other factors could also shape the evolution of the ly@xmath0 luminosity function such as the build - up of dust or an evolving abundance of metal - poor stars within galaxies .    despite these challenges ,",
    "several studies have made estimates for @xmath135 as a function of redshift @xcite .",
    "for dazle , @xcite and @xcite find that roughly @xmath83 lae should be observed at @xmath56 in a single @xmath195 hr pointing of the camera . to estimate",
    "the abundance of laes that will be observed with mosfire on keck and nirspec on jwst is more difficult than for dazle because these instruments are at least an order of magnitude more sensitive , probing a region of the luminosity function that has yet to be explored .",
    "fortunately , an estimate for the observed number of emitters is less important for understanding the scientific impact of mosfire and jwst because the limiting factor will be cosmic variance and not shot noise .    here",
    ", we make predictions for the cosmic variance in the measured lae number density for upcoming surveys .",
    "we do not perform this calculation for a mosfire cluster caustic survey owing to the complicated geometry ( see @xcite ) . in the context of our simple model for the laes ,",
    "cosmic variance depends on just the parameter @xmath88 .",
    "when fluctuations in the measured number density of emitters within a survey volume are on the order of unity about the average abundance @xmath135 , it will be difficult to understand reionization without a larger survey volume .",
    "for example , these fluctuations will prevent a precise measurement of the luminosity function .",
    "the curves in figure [ fig : variance ] represent the standard deviation in the number density of laes ( with the shot noise component subtracted out ) measured with current and upcoming surveys ( and assuming no foreground contamination ) .",
    "note that neutral gas increases the standard deviation significantly .",
    "the dazle and subaru curves are computed assuming that @xmath352 ( which is a conservative choice and requires @xmath353 ) , and the ones for jwst are calculated assuming @xmath354 .",
    "all of these curves are determined by first convolving the lae maps with a window function that has the same volume specifications as these surveys / instruments and , then , by computing the variance of the windowed field .",
    "for jwst , which will take spectra over a broad range of wavelengths with nirspec , we have assumed that the line - of - sight width used to estimate @xmath355 is @xmath196 mpc ( @xmath356 ) .",
    "the choice of @xmath196 mpc is motivated by the short duration of reionization in simulations of reionization ( @xmath357 spans @xmath358 ) and the desire to study laes for a few different ionized fractions during reionization .",
    "the curves in figure [ fig : variance ] are computed from snapshots between @xmath359 and @xmath360 .",
    "the value of @xmath361 depends modestly on the redshift of the survey .",
    "for example , for the sxds , for @xmath362 and @xmath4 then @xmath363 at @xmath30 whereas @xmath364 at @xmath365 .",
    "assumes a square survey in a @xmath83 sq .",
    "sxds is instead a cross - shaped survey with the same volume . ] in addition , if we vary the value of @xmath88 , the results do not change significantly .",
    "the error bars on the dazle and subaru - sxdf curves in figure [ fig : variance ] represent the change in @xmath366 if the fiducial @xmath88 is reduced or increased by a factor of two .",
    "the volume surveyed by dazle is much smaller than the volume of a @xmath367 bubble . for some pointings ,",
    "the surveyed volume may consist entirely of a neutral region ( and zero emitters will be observed ) , and , for other pointings , it may fall entirely within an hii region .",
    "figure [ fig : variance ] shows that in order to constrain the cosmic fluctuations in the luminosity function to @xmath368 , dazle needs @xmath369 non - contiguous pointings when @xmath4 and significantly more pointings when the universe is largely neutral .",
    "( note that @xmath370 for non - contiguous pointings . ) of course , this observing strategy is optimized for reducing the cosmic variance . shot",
    "noise may be as important for dazle .    with jwst",
    ", one might hope to be able to place a tight constraint on the lae luminosity function .",
    "however , for a @xmath371 constraint , jwst needs @xmath369 non - contiguous pointings when @xmath278 ( and @xmath372 when @xmath373 ) .",
    "much of the high - redshift data for jwst will be gathered in the ultra - deep survey ( uds ) , which will be a contiguous field spanning tens of sq .",

    "@xcite . here",
    ", we generously assume a square field of @xmath342 sq .",
    "arc - min ( @xmath374 tiles observed with both nircam and nirspec ) .",
    "figure [ fig : variance ] shows that this observation is far from optimal for constraining the luminosity function with @xmath375 .",
    "a different observing strategy is necessary for jwst to derive tight constraints on reionization with laes .",
    "the largest volume lae survey currently being conducted at @xmath376 is the moircs deep survey on subaru , which targets laes at @xmath377 . while not as sensitive as dazle , its volume of @xmath378 is an order of magnitude larger than that of dazle @xcite",
    ". if we had plotted a curve of @xmath379 for moircs in figure [ fig : variance ] , this curve would fall between the curves for the subaru - sdf and for dazle .    in this section",
    ", we have seen that cosmic variance will be a significant concern for upcoming lae surveys at @xmath349 .",
    "degree - scale surveys make the cosmic variance manageable for this science .",
    "lae surveys are probing increasingly higher redshifts . not only",
    "will these surveys inform us about high - redshift galaxies , but they have the potential to be the first observations to unambiguously detect patchy reionization .",
    "the tens of mpc hii regions during reionization modulate the observed distribution of laes and boost their observed clustering .",
    "we have shown that this effect on the angular correlation function ( section [ clustering ] ) or the void probability distribution ( appendix [ voids ] ) can be well in excess of the intrinsic clustering of halos in the concordance cosmology .",
    "this enhanced clustering depends most strongly on @xmath18 , but also somewhat on the morphology of the hii regions during reionization .",
    "observing enhanced clustering would confirm the prediction that the hii regions during reionization are large .",
    "even the current @xmath3 subaru lae survey , which has a photometric sample of only @xmath2 laes in a @xmath380 deg@xmath381 field , can place constraints on the reionization process .",
    "we find that the angular correlation function of the sdf photometric sample of @xmath3 laes favors an ionized universe over a universe with @xmath5 at a @xmath198-@xmath7 confidence level ( @xmath141-@xmath7 if all emitters have strong galactic winds ) .",
    "this constraint is both competitive with other constraints on @xmath18 obtained from grbs and from laes @xcite , and it rules out the picture of the @xmath382 quasars expanding into a neutral igm .",
    "in addition , this is the first constraint on the ionized fraction that consistently accounts for patchy reionization  the favored model for how the universe is ionized .",
    "observations in the next year in the sdxs will increase the @xmath3 sample by a factor of @xmath383 and place even stronger constraints on @xmath18 .",
    "detecting reionization through lae clustering also offers a simple consistency check for whether the observed correlations owe to reionization : observe the same field with a second selection technique in addition to selecting objects by their ly@xmath0 emission .",
    "if the ly@xmath0-selected galaxies show enhanced clustering relative to the galaxies selected with the other technique , the evidence for reionization is strengthened .",
    "similarly , a comparison of the phases of fourier modes between the two galaxy samples can be used to detect reionization .",
    "while measuring enhanced clustering is the most fool - proof method to detect reionization with laes , the presence of neutral regions in the igm also influences the properties of the ly@xmath0 line and the luminosity function . observing evolution that is consistent with reionization occurring in all of these different statistics",
    "would strengthen the argument for reionization .",
    "we have made predictions for the scale of these effects .",
    "we show in appendix [ lineprofile ] that the effect of reionization on the average line profile is less significant than most previous studies have found .",
    "this result owes to the much larger hii regions that arise from properly treating source clustering and because emitters that are not significantly obscured by the neutral regions are preferentially observed . because of these effects , combined with the uncertainty in the astrophysical processes that determine the ly@xmath0 line shape",
    ", the consequences of reionization will be difficult to isolate in the line profile .",
    "the impact of reionization on the luminosity function is a more promising diagnostic than the line profile .",
    "its effect on the luminosity function is similar among the three reionization models we have considered , if we compare at fixed @xmath18 . in all models and at all",
    "@xmath18 , the lae luminosity function is suppressed by a factor that is fairly constant as a function of luminosity .",
    "our predictions for the impact of reionization on the luminosity function are fairly robust to our assumptions concerning the bias and intrinsic luminosity of emitters , but it may be difficult to distinguish evolution in the luminosity function that owes to reionization from evolution owing to changing intrinsic properties of the emitters .",
    "it is likely that most of reionization occurs at higher redshifts than probed by current samples .",
    "several lae surveys will target @xmath349 laes in the coming years .",
    "unfortunately , these upcoming studies are not optimal for measuring the lae luminosity function or for detecting reionization - induced clustering , having fields of view that are too small to measure this effect precisely .",
    "even the multi - billion dollar satellite jwst has this design flaw .",
    "jwst s enhanced sensitivity over that of current telescopes still makes it useful for this science .",
    "however , a multi - billion dollar space mission is unnecessary to understand reionization with laes .",
    "widefield observations like those on subaru , but that target @xmath335 , will be able to put constraints on the reionization process .",

    "several studies have attempted to understand the impact that reionization has on the profile of ly@xmath0 lines using simple analytic models @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we investigate the effect of reionization on the line profile using simulations .",
    "we show that even when a significant fraction of the universe is neutral , damping wing absorption owing to neutral patches in the igm tends to have a small effect on the average line shape .",
    "we use method 1 described in section [ rt ] to calculate the intrinsic line profile .",
    "for simplicity , method 1 sets the intrinsic width of the line to be @xmath384 , where @xmath385 is the circular velocity of the host halo at the virial radius .",
    "this @xmath386 is the width one expects if the typical column density of hi inside the galaxy , @xmath387 , is low enough such that ionizing photons can escape from the galaxy ( @xmath388 ) and , for the massive galaxies of interest , even if the column density is as high as @xmath389 @xcite .",
    "this @xmath390 is also consistent with the emergent line profile of a 2-phase ism in which dense clouds of hi ( with dust inside ) scatter ly@xmath0 photons . a 2-phase structure may be necessary for the transmission of ly@xmath0 photons in the presence of dust @xcite .",
    "we do not attempt to parameterize all of the complicated processes that determine the width and shape of the intrinsic line , such as the geometry of the galaxy and its bulk motions .",
    "such processes can add additional features to the line profile and make it even more difficult to disentangle the effect of reionization .    in our calculations ,",
    "the observed line profiles differ from one another primarily because of two effects : _ ( 1 ) _ the extent along the line of sight from the emitter to the hii bubble edge .",
    "the extent of the hii region determines the strength of the damping wing absorption .",
    "this effect is the most important for our study . _",
    "( 2 ) _ the amount of infall of gas around the emitter .",
    "this dictates how much of the red side of the line is absorbed as some photons on the red side must redshift through resonance because of the doppler effect , typically resulting in absorption .",
    "( outflows  which we incorporate with a simple prescription  have the opposite effect , allowing more of the blue side of the line to be transmitted . )",
    "the effect of infall is only crudely modeled here because these computations are performed on a @xmath391 mpc grid , whereas the virial radius of a @xmath392 halo is @xmath393 mpc at @xmath30 .",
    "this results in an under - prediction of the effect of infall .",
    "pmpc of a galaxy , eliminating the importance of nearby infall @xcite . ]",
    "the quality of the spectrum from a single @xmath12 lae for current ground - based telescopes is never good enough to constrain in detail the shape of a single ly@xmath0 line .",
    "previous lae surveys have averaged the line profile from all of their emitters to generate a higher quality effective line profile .",
    "figure [ fig : profiles ] shows the average line profiles calculated from snapshots with @xmath394 ( _ top panel _ ) , @xmath395 ( _ middle panel _ ) , and @xmath396 ( _ bottom panel _ ) for @xmath397 , @xmath398 and @xmath133 , respectively .",
    "we have normalized the integral over these curves to unity .",
    "the thick dashed curves are the average profile for laes with @xmath399 for the quoted @xmath18 , whereas the thick solid curves are for the same luminosity range but with @xmath400 .",
    "that appears in these bounds is there to approximate the effect of resonant absorption , which typically absorbs all frequencies blue - ward of @xmath67 . ] because of the exponential falloff in the halo mass function at large @xmath114 , if we eliminated the upper bound on @xmath113 and included more luminous laes in the average , the line profiles would not be significantly affected .",
    "note that the differences between the dashed and solid curves in figure [ fig : profiles ] are small , particularly for the @xmath213 and @xmath171 cases .",
    "the reason why reionization does not have more of an effect on the line profiles is because the average bubble size in which _ observed _ laes lie is larger than a pmpc for the @xmath18 shown in figure [ fig : profiles ] .",
    "previous calculations assumed that each lae was responsible for ionizing its own bubble , resulting in @xmath401 pmpc ( eqn .",
    "[ eqn : rbauto ] ) and , therefore , a larger effect of the damping wing absorption on the observed line profile ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "one might wonder why reionization has any affect on the lae luminosity function and correlation function ( as seen in the body of this paper ) since the average line profile is not strongly affected .",
    "even though the line profile is not changed , the average transmission is decreased by reionization , and many emitters are not observed because of reduced transmission .",
    "galactic winds / outflows , which are found to be very prevalent in lower redshift laes , allow more of the blue side of the line to be transmitted .",
    "here we adopt a simple toy model for galactic winds which is meant to exaggerate their potential effect .",
    "we make the same assumptions for the intrinsic line profile as before , but we redshift the entire line by the velocity of the wind , which is taken to be @xmath402 km s@xmath28 .",
    "this value for @xmath68 is motived by the average velocity offset of the ly@xmath0 line in strong emitters at @xmath158 @xcite .",
    "since galaxies are less massive at @xmath159 than at @xmath158 , the galaxies probably can not drive such powerful winds and @xmath156 km s@xmath28 can be thought of as an upper bound on @xmath68 .",
    "furthermore , it could be the case that only a fraction of the ly@xmath0 photons are scattered by the wind .",
    "the difference between dotted and dot - dashed curves in figure [ fig : profiles ] illustrate the effect of reionization in this wind model .",
    "winds reduce the importance of damping wing absorption .",
    "current narrow band surveys most likely have spectroscopically confirmed laes that have @xmath403 rather than @xmath404 , as considered above .",
    "( only the brightest emitters in a narrow band survey can be spectroscopically confirmed . ) if we take instead emitters within the range @xmath405 ( _ thin curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : profiles ] _ ) , the differences between the line profiles for @xmath4 and @xmath373 are even smaller than in the case previously examined , owing to these more biased sources sitting preferentially in the largest hii regions .    in our computation ,",
    "the fwhm of the observed line profiles for laes that have @xmath406 is @xmath407 ( _ thick curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : profiles ] _ ) and for those that have @xmath408 is @xmath409 ( _ thin curves _ ) .",
    "the fwhm of the average line of the spectroscopically confirmed @xmath410 emitters is @xmath411 , slightly larger than the fwhm in our calculations @xcite .",
    "interestingly , @xcite finds a weak anti - correlation between the fwhm of the line and @xmath113 . in our simple model for the laes ,",
    "in which @xmath412 , there should be a correlation .",
    "@xcite suggest that an anti - correlation may be a signature of reionization .",
    "however , to reach this result , @xcite assume that the intrinsic widths of the ly@xmath0 lines are the same for emitters of all @xmath173 and that the hii region around an emitter is created just by this emitter .",
    "the anti - correlation result from @xcite depends on these dubious assumptions .",
    "there is probably too much uncertain astrophysics to understand reionization through the correlation of the fwhm with @xmath113 .",
    "the weak anti - correlation between fwhm with @xmath413 that is observed ( with low statistical significance ) may indicates that there is more dispersion in the mapping between @xmath114 and @xmath113 than we have assumed in this work or that winds are important in some @xmath136 emitters . as discussed in previous sections , increasing the dispersion in the mapping between @xmath114 and @xmath414 does not significantly affect our conclusions pertaining to the lae luminosity function and to lae clustering .",
    "the emitters in a survey whose line profiles are most strongly affected by reionization may constitute a small sub - sample of the laes in a survey .",
    "therefore , it might be more fruitful to look at individual lines rather than the average line profile to detect reionization . however , even if a survey has sufficient signal to noise to study the ly@xmath0 line from a single emitter , it will be challenging to isolate the impact of damping wing absorption from other effects .",
    "thus far , we have considered the effect of a single model for reionization , model ( i ) , on the line profile . in model ( iii ) , since the bubbles are smaller , the average line profile at fixed @xmath18 is slightly more altered by reionization than in model ( i ) .",
    "the opposite is true in model ( ii ) , in which the bubbles are larger .",
    "however , the differences in the line profiles between the models at fixed @xmath18 are comparable to or smaller than the differences between the line profiles at @xmath415 , and @xmath131 in model ( i ) .",
    "figure [ fig : profiles ] ignored the effect of reionization on the transmission of the ly@xmath0 line and just illustrated its effect on the line profile .",
    "the thick curves in figure [ fig : trans ] represent the ratio of the average of @xmath113 at @xmath18 to the same but at @xmath4 . only emitters with @xmath416",
    "are included in these averages .",
    "this ratio yields approximately the factor @xmath417  the strength of damping wing absorption .",
    "the thick dot - dashed curve is for @xmath130 , the thick dotted curve is for @xmath20 , and the thick solid curve is for @xmath171 .",
    "as @xmath18 decreases , the average @xmath113 also decreases owing to smaller bubbles and increased damping wing absorption . at low @xmath114 ,",
    "the decrease in @xmath414 with @xmath18 is smaller than at large @xmath114 .",
    "this result might may appear surprising since more massive halos sit in larger bubbles , which would result in the opposite tendency .",
    "however , this trend is simply a selection effect owing to the luminosity threshold of this mock survey .",
    "in addition , this selection effect illustrates why the line profiles are not affected as substantially as one might expect : owing to the nature of the luminosity function , most emitters sit near the luminosity threshold . in order for these emitters to be observed , they must sit in very large hii regions such that the effect of damping wing absorption is small .",
    "the power spectrum may not be the optimal statistic to pick out the modulation of laes owing to the bubbles .",
    "one distinctive feature of the lae field during reionization is that there are large voids owing to the large neutral regions ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : maps ] and [ fig : maps2 ] ) .",
    "this feature motivates using the void probability distribution function @xmath418 to measure the effect of reionization , as was done in @xcite .",
    "void statistics have a long history of being used to interpret galaxy surveys ( e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath418 is the probability that a circle of radius @xmath419 around a point in the survey field does not contain any galaxies . for a poisson distribution of galaxies , @xmath420 , where @xmath421 is the surface density of laes .",
    "a generalization of this statistic is the probability that a region contains @xmath422 galaxies , @xmath423 , and , for a poisson distribution , @xmath424 .",
    "figure [ fig : vpdf ] displays @xmath418 computed from the @xmath154 mpc simulation of model ( i ) .",
    "each curve is calculated by averaging five independent surveys of @xmath1 emitters in a volume of @xmath425 ( a little larger than the volume of the sxds ) , yielding @xmath426 .",
    "the thin solid curve is @xmath418 for a poisson distribution .",
    "the thick solid and dot - dashed curves are @xmath418 of an ionized universe with laes in halos with @xmath427 and with @xmath428 , respectively .",
    "the dashed ( dotted curves ) are the ionized case with @xmath20 and with @xmath429 ( @xmath430 ) .",
    "we adjust the duty cycle to fix the number of emitters , requiring @xmath431 for the dotted curve , @xmath432 for the dashed curve , @xmath433 for the dot - dashed , and @xmath432 for the thick solid .",
    "the error bars in figure [ fig : vpdf ] are the standard deviation from a sample of five independent mock surveys with the specifications given above .",
    "note that the error bars in different bins are correlated . from the errors",
    ", we see that we can distinguish the models in this plot at @xmath434-@xmath7 confidence level , and , in particular , we can distinguish the case with reionization from those without reionization .",
    "this is promising because the dot - dashed curve assumes that the laes are in the rarest , most clustered halos , and this curve is below those with @xmath20 .",
    "clustering of laes owing to reionization generates large - scale voids to a much larger degree than the intrinsic clustering of halos in @xmath39cdm .",
    "figure [ fig : vpdf_xi ] shows @xmath418 for different @xmath18 calculated from reionization model ( i ) .",
    "these curves are calculated assuming @xmath1 lae , @xmath204 , and for a survey comparable in volume to the sxds . as with the correlation function",
    ", @xmath418 can distinguish the four different @xmath18 in this figure .",
    "qualitatively , the significance with which @xmath418 enables one to distinguish between these different @xmath18 appears to be comparable to the significance the correlation function affords .",
    "thus far , we have assumed no contamination from foreground galaxies , which is certainly not the case for photometric lae surveys .",
    "unfortunately , a luminosity - limited , widefield spectroscopic lae survey at @xmath12 has not been conducted .",
    "if there is significant contamination in the survey , then the measured value of @xmath435 will be significantly biased , suppressed ( on average ) by the factor @xmath436 where @xmath437 is the density of contaminating galaxies ( assuming that the contaminants are uncorrelated ) .",
    "if @xmath438 is appreciable , this suppression is significant , especially at large @xmath419 . @xcite",
    "measured @xmath435 from the sdf photometric sample of lae at @xmath3 .",
    "they found that the measured @xmath435 is consistent with a random sample .",
    "this conclusion may owe to contamination biasing their measurement .",
    "we can attempt to alleviate this issue of foreground galaxy contamination biasing @xmath435 by instead computing the statistics @xmath439 , etc .",
    ", which are progressively less biased by this effect . in this vein , we can do the exact opposite and use peaks rather than voids to probe reionization . as long as",
    "these peaks are sufficiently rare , they will exist only in a distribution of emitters that is clustered .",
    "in addition , peaks in the emitter distribution are a distinctive feature of ly@xmath0 maps during reionization ( see figs . [",
    "fig : maps ] and [ fig : maps2 ] ) .    we have investigated the statistic @xmath440 where @xmath14 is a constant that we have varied between @xmath198 and @xmath195 and @xmath441 is a function that returns the largest integer smaller than @xmath442 .",
    "we find that @xmath443 can distinguish the models considered in figure [ fig : vpdf ] with comparable significance to @xmath435 . like @xmath435 ,",
    "a survey needs an estimate for its contamination fraction to be able to predict @xmath443 .",
    "this can be estimated by performing spectroscopic follow - up on a portion of the survey .",
    "unlike @xmath435 , the bias in the estimation of @xmath443 incurred by foreground contamination is not an exponential factor , and , therefore , a survey can more accurately correct for this bias with an estimate of @xmath91 .",
    "more work needs to be done to quantify how much independent information derives from void ( and peak ) statistics compared to the correlation function and to quantify the benefits of these statistics over the correlation function .",
    "in @xcite , the effect of the morphology of reionization on the source properties , on the redshift of reionization , and on the minihalos were investigated in detail .",
    "@xcite found that the structure of the hii regions during reionization was robust to most considered effects , with the most important dependence being the value of the ionized fraction .",
    "however , the effect of a duty cycle for the ionizing sources  the fraction of time the sources are emitting ionizing photons  on the structure of the hii regions was omitted in their analysis .",
    "it is probable that star formation at high redshifts is sporadic . at",
    "any given time , a small fraction of galaxies may contain the high mass stars that produce ionizing photons .",
    "these active galaxies are probably also the laes .",
    "it is interesting to understand the effect of a small ionizing photon duty cycle @xmath444 on the structure of the hii regions .",
    "none of the simulations used in the body of this paper included this effect .",
    "figure [ fig : duty ] compares the @xmath445 simulation using model ( i ) in which @xmath446 ( _ left panels _ ) to a simulation where @xmath447 and in which the sources that are active have a luminosity that is boosted by a factor of @xmath195 over the sources in model ( i ) ( _ right panels _ ) . to achieve @xmath448 , @xmath449 of the sources are randomly selected to be active , and this randomization is performed every @xmath37 million years .",
    "twenty - million years was chosen to roughly match the lifetime of massive stars .",
    "one can see in figure [ fig : duty ] that the large hii regions are very similar between these two cases .",
    "this invariance owes to thousands of emitters in each large bubble contributing to its ionization , such that the total number of photons produced inside the bubble , and , therefore , the bubble size is largely unaffected by @xmath450 .",
    "a similar conclusion about the effect of @xmath450 was reached in the analytic study of @xcite .",
    "the duty cycle does influence the smallest hii regions  bubbles small enough such that shot noise in the number of galaxies is important .",
    "the criterion for @xmath450 to change the lae statistics from models in which all galaxies are active is that the fluctuations owing to shot noise in the total number of source galaxies must be comparable to the cosmological fluctuations in the number of these galaxies within bubbles of size @xmath451 pmpc . at @xmath452",
    "there are @xmath453 galaxies emitting ionizing photons in an hii region of size @xmath83 pmpc in the source models discussed in this paper , whereas cosmological fluctuations in the source abundance are of the order of unity at this scale .",
    "therefore , it would require either @xmath454 for the value of @xmath450 to affect the statistics of the laes .",
    "the @xcite and @xcite radiative transfer code has been improved for this paper to group sources more efficiently , speeding up the computation . in previous versions of the code ,",
    "only sources that fall within the same grid cell were grouped as a single source , often resulting in tens of millions of sources that must be processed in a time step .",
    "this algorithm did not take advantage of the fact that the hii regions become much larger than the size of a grid cell , motivating a more aggressive grouping algorithm without a significant loss in accuracy .      1 .   smooth ionization field @xmath238 at scale @xmath419 with a top hat filter , yielding the field @xmath455 2 .",
    "loop over sources in random order .",
    "if a source is in a cell in which @xmath456 , check that @xmath457 is also satisfied at all @xmath458 .",
    "if yes , group sources within a sphere of radius @xmath459 into a single source , and place the new source at the center of luminosity of the grouped sources .",
    "3 .   repeat previous steps for smaller @xmath419 , but only using the sources which have not been grouped .",
    "stop when @xmath460 is less than the width of a grid cell .",
    "4 .   take the new grouped source field and repeat all previous steps once again .    in this paper ,",
    "we start smoothing with @xmath461 , and set @xmath462 and @xmath463 . as a test of this algorithm",
    ", we have cross correlated the ionization field generated from a simulation that has source grouping to one without source grouping , but with the same sources and at fixed @xmath18 .",
    "we find no appreciable difference between the two ionization fields , implying that source grouping does not affect our conclusions .",
    "source grouping speeds up the radiative transfer algorithm considerably when @xmath464 .",
    "more aggressive grouping does lead to less accuracy in determining the local photo - ionization rate around sources , which can influence the transmission properties of the ly@xmath0 line .",
    "however , we only use this more aggressive grouping algorithm in combination with method 2 in section [ calculations ] to calculate the line flux , and method 2 does not depend on the details of the photo - ionization state of the gas ."
