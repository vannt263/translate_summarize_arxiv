    "spin glasses are disordered magnetic alloys whose understanding has defied physicists for decades.@xcite in this context , the ising edwards - anderson model@xcite has played a major role .",
    "however , in spite of its prominence , it took 25 years to show that it undergoes a continuous phase transition at a critical temperature @xmath8@xcite ( there was an earlier consensus on the existence of a phase transition,@xcite but its nature had remained unclear ) .",
    "amusingly , evidence for a phase transition on experimental spin glasses had been obtained several years before.@xcite    since then , the critical behavior of the edwards - anderson model has been studied numerically in a number of papers.@xcite in these works , microscopic details such as the distribution of the coupling constants differ .",
    "it was unclear whether universality violations were present in the problem because the critical exponents and other universal quantities seemed to depend on those microscopic details ( although some authors@xcite argued that these apparent violations were caused by corrections to scaling ) .",
    "the issue was settled in 2008 by hasenbusch , pelissetto and vicari,@xcite who emphasized the role of corrections to scaling , thus convincing the community that universality holds .",
    "furthermore , their computation of most universal quantities is still the most accurate to date .    here",
    "we present a high - precision finite - size scaling study of the ising edwards - anderson model . using the janus special - purpose computer,@xcite we thermalize the largest lattices to date ( @xmath0 ) , with a very large number of samples .",
    "even with this increased accuracy , we confirm that the analysis with leading - order scaling corrections is adequate ( however , see below sect .",
    "[ sect : dimensionless ] ) . in this way",
    ", we achieve a determination of the critical exponents four times more accurate than the one in ref .  .",
    "we also compute a number of universal quantities not previously considered in the literature .",
    "reliable determinations of the critical parameters are important to make progress in other fronts , such as the study of the correlation functions below @xmath9,@xcite or the behavior of spin glasses in an externally applied magnetic field.@xcite    the organization of the remaining part of this work is as follows . in section  [",
    "sect : model - simulations ] we define the model and provide details about our simulations .",
    "the quantities that we compute are defined in section  [ sect : observables ] .",
    "the finite - size scaling analysis is briefly reviewed in section  [ sect : fss ] .",
    "our main results are given in section  [ sect : mega - fit ] , where we compute the critical exponents , including the corrections to scaling exponent @xmath10 ( see also appendix [ sec : omega - alt ] ) , as well as the critical correlation length in units of the lattice size @xmath11 and the binder cumulant @xmath12 .",
    "with this input , we proceed to compute in section  [ sect : other ] other universal cumulants and the critical temperature . finally , we discuss our conclusions in section  [ sect : conclusions ] .",

    "the simulations on janus ( @xmath35 ) consisted of a total of @xmath36 heat - bath spin updates , equivalent to about @xmath37 days of a single processing unit ( fpga ) .",
    "we have checked that our data are not affected by thermalization effects .",
    "for the largest lattice sizes ( @xmath35 ) we use the method reported in ref .  , which consists in computing the exponential autocorrelation time @xmath38 for each sample , using the temperature random walk during the parallel tempering .",
    "we extend each sample until the simulation time is at least @xmath39 ( therefore , the length of the simulation depends on the sample , as shown on table  [ tab : simulations ] ) . for the lattices simulated with multi - spin coding , this sample - by - sample method is more involved.@xcite therefore , taking into account that almost all our observables are measured during the simulation",
    ", we have decided to use the more traditional approach of studying the time evolution of sample - averaged quantities on a logarithmic scale .",
    "all the quantities that we have considered are stable on the last two logarithmic bins , corresponding to the second half and the second quarter of the run .",
    "in fact , this condition is satisfied even if we subtract from each successive bin the result over the last half of the measurements , thus significantly reducing the error bars.@xcite    in general , we compute all the physical quantities by averaging over the second half of the simulation .",
    "however , as a further check , we have also recomputed all the final quantities using only the last block of measurements ( which , depending on the lattice , corresponds from @xmath40 to @xmath41 of the total simulation time ) .",

    "as explained in section  [ sect : mega - fit ] , we have not used the non - standard dimensionless ratios defined in section  [ sect : observables ] [ eqs .   ] to determine the critical exponents of the system .",
    "however , since some of these quantities have been found useful in the past@xcite and since they are universal quantities further characterizing the ising spin glass universality class , we have found it interesting to report their critical values .",
    "we perform fits to @xmath48 where @xmath49 is each of @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",

    "the estimate of @xmath54 changed by less than one tenth of an error bar for @xmath58 and @xmath59 . in the case of @xmath60 the obtained result varied a full error bar ( we obtained @xmath61 $ ] in the fit with @xmath62 ) .",
    "given the data correlation , this difference might be significant , so we suggest doubling the error for @xmath60 in table  [ tab : cumulants ] if one wants to be specially careful .    unfortunately ,",
    "subleading scaling corrections are more difficult to control for @xmath63 .",
    "the extrapolation for @xmath64 and @xmath62 are clearly incompatible , see figure  [ fig : r12-ay - ay - ay ] . considering subleading corrections of order @xmath65 does not improve the situation .",

    "is of systematic rather than of statistical nature .     or @xmath12 , one is free to consider the dimensionless quantity @xmath49 as computed for the small system ( @xmath67 ) or for the large system ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "this choice turns out to be immaterial for all quantities reported in table  [ tab : cumulants ] , but not for @xmath56 . in the plot , we display the values of @xmath56 at the corresponding crossing point , as a function of @xmath69 .",

    "as mentioned in section  [ sect : mega - fit ] , the computation of the scaling corrections exponent @xmath10 is the most delicate step in the analysis .",

    "we start by making the rather obvious remark that the quotient @xmath76 of any dimensionless quantity @xmath49 at the crossing points @xmath77 defined by any other dimensionless quantity @xmath78 [ so @xmath79 goes to one as the system size increases @xmath80 the advantage of this equation is that , unlike in our analysis of section  [ sect : mega - fit ] , the asymptotic value is not another parameter in the fit , but known in advance .",

    "[ fig : omega - alt ] we have performed individual fits to   for each quantity , using the previously computed value of @xmath10 , to show that this description is consistent . from the plot",
    "we can see that some of the quantities ( such as @xmath56 ) have very clear subleading scaling corrections , but that for others the leading term in   is quite sufficient .",
    "armed with this qualitative observation , we can do a second fit to  , this time leaving @xmath10 free and considering several dimensionless quantities at the same time .",
    "in particular , in order to avoid the quadratic term , we have considered @xmath84 and @xmath85 and discarded the data for @xmath86 .",
    "the result of this joint fit is @xmath87 compatible with our previous determination of @xmath10 .",
