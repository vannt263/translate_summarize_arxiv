    "the dynamic properties and conditional independence structure of stochastic kinetic models are analyzed using a marked point process framework . a stochastic kinetic model or skm is a highly multivariate jump process used to describe chemical reaction networks .",
    "skms have become particularly important as models of the network of interacting biomolecules in a cellular system .",
    "the necessity of a stochastic process approach to the dynamics of such biochemical reaction systems is now clear @xcite , with skms providing continuous - time , mechanistic descriptions firmly grounded in chemical kinetic theory and the underlying statistical physics .",
    "the gillespie algorithm @xcite for simulation of skms is now an important tool in the science of systems biology .",
    "however , there are few analytical tools for study of the dynamic properties of skms ( although note @xcite and @xcite ) , especially when the skm is of modest or high dimension .",
    "this paper develops what appear to be the first methods for analyzing the local and global dynamic independence structure implied by a given skm and shows how these may be used to uncover the modular architecture of the network at coarser or finer levels of resolution .",
    "the required information about the parameters of the skm is modest , and consistent with the partial information about these currently available for many biochemical reaction networks .",
    "skms are often thought of as continuous - time , homogeneous markov chains having nonfinite state space .",
    "however , the fact that there are a finite number of possible types of jump of the process  corresponding to the different types of possible biochemical reaction in the system  allows formulation of both the skm and its subprocesses as multivariate counting processes .",
    "this turns out to be a fruitful approach for the problems addressed here .",
    "in fact , the markov property is not needed for the results and methods of the paper .",
    "the main contributions may be summarized as follows .",
    "graphical models for skms and dynamic molecular networks are introduced .",
    "these kinetic independence graphs ( kigs ) are directed , cyclic graphs whose vertices are the different types ( or species ) of biomolecule in the system .",
    "the kig encodes local independences that result from a lack of dependence of the conditional intensity of a subprocess on the internal history of some of the species .",
    "given a partition @xmath6 $ ] of the vertices , the graphical separation @xmath7 in the undirected version of the kig has an intuitive chemical interpretation and implies @xmath2 is locally ( or `` instantaneously '' ) independent of @xmath3 given @xmath4 ( and @xmath3 locally independent of @xmath2 given @xmath8 ) .",
    "it is proved that this separation also results in conditional independence , over any finite time interval @xmath9 $ ] , of the internal histories of @xmath2 and @xmath3 conditional on a history of the jumps in @xmath5 .",
    "conditions under which this history corresponds to the internal history of @xmath5 are derived and are easily checked computationally .",
    "such a conditional independence is termed a global ( as opposed to local ) dynamic independence here .",
    "the new results enable mathematical definition of a modularization of an skm using its implied dynamics .",
    "graphical decomposition methods are developed for the identification of nested modularizations that allow the extent of coarse - graining to be varied and provide computationally efficient algorithms for large skms .",
    "junction tree representations are shown to provide a useful tool for visualizing , summarizing and manipulating the modularizations . applying the techniques of the paper to an skm that represents detailed empirical knowledge of the metabolic network of the human red blood cell yields new insight into the biological organization and dynamics of this cellular system .",
    "graphical models and their associated analytical and computational methods allow the modularization of large , complex models into smaller components and provide a particularly effective means of representing and analyzing conditional independence relationships @xcite .",
    "certain graphical approaches are now used quite extensively in computational biology and have also been readily assimilated by the wider biological scientific community , which has long found diagrammatic representations of reaction schemes useful @xcite . however",
    ", rigorous graphical representations of biochemical networks as dynamic processes  that is graphical models in the statistical sense  do not appear to have been considered previously .",
    "indeed , graphical models for continuous time stochastic processes in general are in an early stage of development .",
    "didelez @xcite introduced graphs based on the local independence structure of conditional intensities for finite state , composable markov processes and multivariate point processes , respectively ; @xcite is an earlier contribution , also for finite state markov processes .",
    "skms require new methods since interest is in dynamic independences between groups of species rather than the counting processes for the different types of reaction per se .",
    "furthermore , the markov process for species concentrations implied by the skm neither has finite state space , nor is it composable for most skms of interest ( see section [ sec3 ] ) .    in practice",
    ", the skm is constructed from a large list of the biochemical reactions that comprise the network under study .",
    "this list , or `` network reconstruction , '' is usually compiled using extensive experimental evidence in the literature on the component parts of the system and their molecular interactions @xcite .",
    "indeed , the approaches of molecular biology and genetics , including genome sequencing , have already proved remarkably successful in providing life scientists with a very extensive `` parts list '' for biology .",
    "systems biology is an increasingly influential , interdisciplinary approach that aims to describe mathematically the stochastic dynamic behavior of the whole system as an emergent property of the network of interacting biomolecules @xcite .",
    "a principal challenge is thus to map from fine level descriptions such as reaction lists and their implied skms to higher level , coarse - grained descriptions of the dynamic properties .",
    "related is the increasingly held view that biochemical reaction networks are modular , that is their architecture can be decomposed into units that perform `` nearly independently '' @xcite , and that identifying such modules is a crucial step in the endeavor to understand and , ultimately , to selectively control cellular systems .",
    "however , it is recognized that rigorous , mathematical definition and identification of modularizations for biochemical networks is difficult , especially from a dynamic perspective ( see @xcite , chapter 3 ) . as a result ,",
    "such modularization techniques have been slow to develop , and there seems to be no prior work allowing for stochastic and non - steady state dynamics .",
    "the dynamic independence results and associated graphical methods developed here provide an effective means of addressing these problems .",
    "broadly speaking , the paper also illustrates the utility of a statistical and probabilistic approach to the dynamics of biological systems which , despite their stochastic nature , have hitherto more often received the attention of physical scientists .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "section [ sec21 ] introduces skms and reaction networks in a manner requiring no previous background in systems biology or biochemistry .",
    "section [ sec22 ] defines an skm as a marked point process and provides a formal construction using the well - known gillespie algorithm as a point of departure .",
    "section [ sec23 ] then shows how to accommodate subprocesses of the skm in a counting process framework and discusses their conditional intensities and internal histories ( natural filtrations ) . section [ sec3 ] introduces the kinetic independence graphs , or kigs , and examines local independence and graphical separation in the undirected kig . section [ sec4 ] then relates these to global conditional independence of species histories in theorems [ main1 ] and [ main2 ] , which are central to the paper .",
    "rigorous proofs of these theorems are quite involved and are given as appendix [ appa ] .",
    "section [ sec5 ] develops graphical decomposition methods and associated theory for the identification of modularizations of skms , while section [ sec6 ] applies the techniques of the paper to the skm of the human red blood cell .",
    "section [ sec7 ] highlights some directions for future research .",
    "a stochastic kinetic model is a continuous - time jump process modeling the state of a chemical system , @xmath10^{\\prime}$ ] , where @xmath11 is interpreted as the nonnegative , integer number of molecules of type @xmath12 present at time @xmath13 .",
    "the set of different types of molecule or the _ species set _ is given by @xmath14 .",
    "there are a finite number of possible types of jump in @xmath15 that may take place , corresponding to the different types of possible _ reaction _ , @xmath16 .",
    "it is particularly useful for our purposes to view an skm as a marked point process or mpp in which the points or `` events '' correspond to the jump times of the process @xmath15 .",
    "mathematically , a particular reaction can then be identified with an element of the finite mark space and each mark indicates the type of jump associated with the corresponding jump time .",
    "an skm is denoted here by @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the @xmath19th jump time .",

    "confining attention to a finite interval of time @xmath38 , provided that @xmath34 has finite expectation @xmath39 ( and that @xmath40 $ ] is bounded by an integrable random variable ) , each intensity is a local rate of reaction in exactly the chemical sense  that is , @xmath41 $ ] , the conditionally expected number of reactions of type @xmath29 per unit time in the limit as @xmath42 goes to zero . of course , the intensities are themselves random variables ( r.v.s ) since the evolution of @xmath43 up to time @xmath13 is itself a stochastic process , hence the appearance of the conditional expectation .",
    "a technical subtlety is that @xmath37 is defined to have sample paths that are left - continuous ( with limits from the right ) , compared to the right - continuous sample paths of @xmath15 .",
    "a heuristic chemical interpretation is that if a jump in @xmath44 takes place at @xmath13 , then future jumps are ( locally ) determined by the intensity evaluated `` immediately after '' @xmath13 .",

    "there is no assumption that @xmath48\\cap p[m]=\\varnothing$ ] , and if @xmath54 is both a product and a reactant then @xmath57 .",
