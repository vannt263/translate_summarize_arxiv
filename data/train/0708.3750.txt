    "the understanding of the degree of entanglement in extended quantum systems has prompted an enormous effort in a field at the border of condensed matter physics , quantum information theory , and quantum field theory .",
    "it would take too long to mention all the topics and problems addressed so far : we refer the reader to a recent thorough review and extensive bibliography @xcite .",
    "several measures have been introduced to quantify the entanglement in an extended system @xcite . among them",
    "we consider here only the entanglement entropy , which is defined as follows .",
    "suppose a whole system is in a pure quantum state @xmath0 , with density matrix @xmath1 , and an observer a measures only a subset @xmath2 of a complete set of commuting observables , while another observer b may measure the remainder .",
    "a s reduced density matrix is @xmath3 .",
    "the entanglement entropy is just the von neumann entropy s_a =- tr_a_a_a [ eedef ] associated with this reduced density matrix . for an unentangled product state ,",
    "conversely , @xmath5 should be a maximum for a maximally entangled state .",
    "one of the most striking features of the entanglement entropy is its universal behavior displayed at and close to a quantum phase transition .",
    "in fact , close to a quantum critical point , where the correlation length @xmath6 is much larger than the lattice spacing @xmath7 , the long - distance behavior of the correlations in the ground state of a quantum spin chain are effectively described by a 1 + 1 dimensional quantum field theory . at the critical point , where @xmath6 diverges , the field theory , if lorentz invariant , is also a _ conformal _ field theory ( cft ) . in the latter case",
    ", it has been shown that , if @xmath2 is an interval of length @xmath8 in an infinite chain , @xmath9 @xcite , where @xmath10 is the central charge of the corresponding cft .",
    "when the correlation length @xmath6 is large but finite ( more precisely @xmath11 ) , it has been shown that , increasing @xmath8 , @xmath5 saturates @xcite to @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "recently the interest in the properties of entanglement has been extended to understanding its dynamical behavior .",
    "the natural question is how the entanglement propagates through the system when it is prepared in a state that is not an eigenstate and then is left to evolve in the absence of any dissipation .",
    "the most common situation studied so far concerns a sudden quench of some coupling of the model hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "the main motivation for the large number of studies of this dynamics is that it may actually be realized and measured in ultra - cold atomic systems @xcite . for a complete list of references on the subject",
    "we refer to our earlier paper @xcite .    here",
    "we consider a different situation , known in the literature as local quench @xcite .",
    "we will concentrate on the case when a physical one - dimensional system ( e.g. a spin chain ) is physically cut into two parts that are in their own ground state .",
    "we then join the two halves at a given time @xmath13 and study the subsequent evolution according to a translational invariant hamiltonian . here , the entanglement entropy is the most natural quantity to be studied because the two halves are clearly unentangled for @xmath14 whereas the initial energy differs from that of the ground state only by a finite amount .",
    "this differs from the case of a global quench , when the energy of the initial state above the ground state is always extensive , and correspondingly the entanglement can be extensively larger .",
    "we will only consider gapless models that are described asymptotically by a boundary cft , since in this case we can use powerful analytic results @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ seccft ] we briefly recall the cft approach to the entanglement entropy .",
    "we outline the setup for the local quench which is then applied to different situations in the following section [ secenta ] .",
    "then we consider the time evolution of correlation functions in sec .",
    "[ seccf ] . in sec .",
    "[ seccur ] we describe how this approach can be generalized to the case with two joining points and we derive an heuristic solution . finally we conclude the paper with a discussion of open problems and possible generalizations in sec .",

    "( [ eedef ] ) can be studied in a general quantum field theory through the replica trick @xcite s_a=.-_a^n|_n=1 .",
    "this is particular useful in a cft because , when @xmath2 consists of disjoint intervals with @xmath15 boundary points with @xmath16 , @xmath17 transforms under a general conformal transformation as the @xmath15 point function of a primary field @xmath18 with conformal dimension @xcite x_n= ( n-1n ) , where @xmath10 is the central charge of the underlying cft .    in particular",
    "this implies that the entanglement entropy of a slit of length @xmath8 in an infinite system is given by _",
    "a^n= c_n ( ) ^-2x_n s_a=3 + c_1 , where @xmath7 is an uv cutoff ( e.g. in a spin chain is the lattice spacing ) .",
    "the constants @xmath19 are also non - universal and so is the derivative for @xmath20 , @xmath21 , entering in @xmath5 .",
    "however , in any particular model , @xmath7 and @xmath21 can be fixed unambiguously by specific requirements ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "another important result we will use in the following is the entanglement of the slit @xmath22 $ ] in a semi - infinite line with specific boundary conditions at @xmath23 , that is given by @xcite _ a^n= _ n ( ) ^-x_n s_a=6 + _1 .",
    "[ saboun ] in analogy to the @xmath19 , the constants @xmath24 are not universal and depend on the boundary condition at @xmath23 . however comparing the finite temperature result of ref .",
    "@xcite with the standard thermodynamic entropy for systems with boundaries @xcite we have @xcite _1-c_1/2=g , where @xmath25 is the boundary entropy first introduced by affleck and ludwig @xcite .",
    "we recall that @xmath26 is universal and and depends only on the boundary cft .",
    "cft is also able to predict the time - dependence of the entanglement entropy after a global quench @xcite .",
    "we briefly summarize here these results , because some of them will be useful in understanding the local case .",
    "the density matrix has the path integral representation @xcite ",
    "( r)|(t)|(r)=z_1 ^ -1 ",
    "( r)|e^-ith - h|_0(r)_0(r)|e^+ith - h|(r ) , [ dm0 ] where we included damping factors @xmath27 in such a way as to make the path integral absolutely convergent .",
    "each of the factors may be represented by an analytically continued path integral in imaginary time : the first one over fields @xmath28 which take the boundary values @xmath29 on @xmath30 and @xmath31 on @xmath32 , and the second with @xmath28 taking the values @xmath33 on @xmath32 and @xmath29 on @xmath34 .",
    "when @xmath35 is critical and the field theory is a cft , under the renormalization group any _ translationally _ invariant boundary condition is supposed to flow into a boundary fixed point , satisfying conformal boundary conditions .",
    "thus we may assume that the state @xmath36 corresponds to such boundary conditions on sufficiently long length scales .",
    "thus , for real @xmath37 , the strip geometry described above may be obtained from the upper half - plane ( where the entanglement entropy is known from @xcite ) by the conformal mapping @xmath38 . in this way one",
    "easily get the result for imaginary time .",
    "the real time evolution is obtained by continuing @xmath39 .",
    "the final result is @xcite s_a(t ) from this we note that @xmath40 enters in the calculation in an essential way .",
    "a careful analysis @xcite shows that in fact it corresponds to the correlation length in the initial state and so it is not only a useful tool , but a physical important parameter .",
    "the fact that @xmath41 increases linearly until it saturates at @xmath42 has a simple interpretation in terms of quasiparticles excitations emitted from the initial state at @xmath13 and freely propagating with velocity @xmath43 .",
    "this phenomenon is very general and holds even for non - critical systems , and it has been confirmed by exactly integrable dynamics and numerics ( see e.g. @xcite ) however , since in lattice models there are particles moving slower than @xmath44 , after @xmath45 the entropy does not saturate abruptly , but is a slowly increasing function of the time . the same picture is valid for the correlation functions .",
    "firstly incoherent quasi - particles arriving a given point from well - separated sources cause relaxation of ( most ) local observables towards their ground - state expectation values .",
    "secondly , entangled quasiparticles ( emitted from an initially correlated region ) arriving at the same time @xmath46 induce correlations between local observables . in the case where they travel at a unique speed @xmath44 , therefore , there is a sharp `` horizon '' effect : the connected correlations do not change significantly from their initial values until time @xmath47 . after this",
    "they rapidly saturate to time - independent values .",
    "for large separations , these decay exponentially differently from the power law dependence in the ground state . also for correlation functions , this picture has been shown to be valid in several models ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is clear that a very similar interpretation should apply also for local quenches , but with the fundamental difference that now the quasi - particle excitations are emitted only from the point where the quench happened and not from everywhere .",
    "suppose we physically cut a spin chain at the boundaries between two subsystems a and b , and prepare a state where the individual pieces are in their respective ground states .",
    "in this state the two subsystems are completely unentangled , and its energy differs from that of the ground state by only a finite amount . let us join up the pieces at time @xmath48 and watch the system evolve up to @xmath13 .",
    "the procedure for the global quenches does not apply because the initial state is not translational invariant and will not flow under the renormalization group toward a conformally invariant boundary state .",
    "one may try to handle the problem introducing proper boundary condition changing operators ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however we prefer to take a different approach .",
    "in fact , we can simply represent the corresponding density matrix in terms of path integral on a modified world - sheet .",
    "the physical cut corresponds to having a slit parallel to the ( imaginary ) time axis , starting from @xmath49 up to @xmath50 ( the time when the two pieces have been joined ) , and analogously the other term of the density matrix , like in eq .",
    "( [ dm0 ] ) , gives a slit from @xmath51 to @xmath52 .",
    "again we introduced the regularization factor @xmath40 , that we will interpret a posteriori .    for computational simplicity we will consider the translated geometry with two cuts starting at @xmath53 and operator inserted at imaginary time @xmath37 .",
    "this should be considered real during the course of all the computation , and only at the end can be analytically continued to @xmath54 .",
    "this plane with the two slits is pictorially represented on the left of fig .",
    "[ map1 ] where @xmath55 corresponds to @xmath56 .",
    "as shown in the same figure , the @xmath57-plane is mapped into the half - plane @xmath58 by means of the conformal mapping w=+ z=. [ mapp1 ] on the two slits in the @xmath57 plane ( and so on the imaginary axis in the @xmath59 one ) conformal boundary conditions compatible with the initial state must be imposed .",
    "for example , in the most natural situation when the boundary `` spins '' are left free , we require free boundary conditions .",
    "oppositely , when the boundary spins are supposed to stay in a particular state we require fixed boundary conditions .",
    "note that this setting is valid in any dimension when the system is prepared in two spatially divided halves . in this case",
    "one can try to tackle the problem with the methods of boundary critical phenomena @xcite , but this will be extremely difficult , if not impossible , since conformal invariance is far less powerful .",
    "in this section we consider the time evolution of the entanglement entropy after the local quench .",
    "we consider two half - chains joined together at the point @xmath60 at a given time .",
    "the various subcases we consider correspond to different spatial partitions of the system among which we calculate the entanglement .",
    "we consider the four different situations depicted in fig .",
    "[ confs ] .",
    "we start with the more natural division , considering the entanglement entropy between the two parts in which the system was divided before the quench ( case i ) . as case ii",
    "we consider the entanglement of the region @xmath61 with @xmath62 .",
    "this will allow us to identify simple horizon effects .",
    "to highlight the interaction of the two previous effects we then consider the entanglement of the part @xmath63 $ ] with the rest ( case iii ) .",

    "clearly cases i and iii are particular choices of ii and iv respectively and can be derived as simple limits .",
    "however we prefer to present the results in such order because the physical effects and their interpretation will emerge in a more natural way .",

    "note that , even if non - universal , for a given lattice model the constant @xmath72 can be fixed only by ground state quantities . consequently eq . ( [ shalf ] ) has no free dynamical parameter .",
    "the parameter @xmath40 depends in a specific manner on the boundary contribution to the entanglement @xmath72 .",
    "this is completely different from what happens for a global quench where the equivalent regulator is connected to the correlation length in the initial state @xcite .",
    "furthermore the order of magnitude of @xmath40 is fixed by the lattice spacing @xmath7 ( i.e. the uv cutoff ) and so considering the limit of times and lengths larger than @xmath40 is equivalent to the standard condition to apply the field theory for distances larger than @xmath7 .",
    "let us now consider the entanglement of the region @xmath61 with the rest of the system .",

    "this is a signal that for long time the system still remembers something of the initial configuration as a boundary term that is unable to `` dissipate '' .",

    "finally we can study the result for @xmath13 when @xmath106 : s_a(t=0)=6 + 2_1= 6 + _1 , where in the last equality we used the value of @xmath40 given by eq .",

    "again this is an highly non - trivial consistency check of all the method .",
    "a final curiosity is that 2s_a(t=0)-s_a(t>)=32 , is independent of the details of the theory .",
    "let us now consider the most general case of a slit @xmath107 $ ] . in the @xmath57 plane we have to calculate the two - point function between @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",

    "@xmath119 can be either positive or negative .",
    "for @xmath120 we have a different result if the two points are on the same side or on different sides of the defect , namely : s_a(t<|_2|)= the first is just the sum of the entanglement entropies of two slits of length @xmath116 and @xmath121 in the half - line starting at the origin .",
    "in fact , in the initial state the two parts are unentangled and the total entropy is the sum of the two . also the second result is just the ground state value for the slit @xmath122 $ ] in the half - line @xcite .",
    "the entanglement between @xmath2 and @xmath16 becomes sensitive to the joining of the system when the quasiparticles emitted from the origin arrive at @xmath119 .",
    "the behavior for @xmath123 does not depend on the relative sign of the @xmath117 : s_a(|_2|<t<_1)=6 + 2 _1 .",
    "finally for @xmath124 we have almost the ground state value : s_a(t>_1)=3 a + 2_1 , that is exactly the same as for case iii .    the resulting @xmath5 for different values of @xmath117 is plotted in fig . [ figslit ] . for @xmath125",
    "there is again a large plateau whose actual extension and value depend on both @xmath117 .",
    "the analytical value of the plateau is quite complicated and not really illuminating ( it contains cubic roots , as can be realized solving the equation for the maximum ) .",
    "the most important features are that it decreases when the defect penetrates deeply in the slit ( left part of fig .",
    "[ figslit ] ) and it stays almost constant when the slit moves far from the defect ( right part of the figure ) .    finally one can easily read off from our formula the result for a defect exactly at the center of the slit : the entanglement entropy is independent of the time .",
    "this is different from what found numerically in a lattice model @xcite and will be discussed ( among the other things ) in the next subsection .",
    "as far as we are aware the entanglement entropy after a local quench has been discussed in only two papers @xcite .",
    "there are a few qualitative differences between these results and the asymptotic ones of the cft that are easily understood in terms of the general scenario we draw for quasiparticles emitted from the origin . these differences are attributable to slow quasiparticles , that exist as consequence of a non - linear dispersion relation @xmath126 , emitted from the joining point at @xmath13 .",
    "the first difference is that the lattice numerics present , on top of a smooth curve , very fast oscillations .",
    "these oscillations have been discussed in the context of global quenches @xcite , and are due to the modes at the zone boundary @xmath127 that have @xmath128 .",
    "however , they are only corrections to the asymptotic result for @xmath129 , since their amplitude remains constant while the cft result diverges . furthermore for any specific model",
    "they can be easily predicted in a quantitative way .    in ref .",
    "@xcite different configurations of slits were considered for electron hopping on a chain ( xx model in spin language ) .",
    "the sharp horizon effect is present even in the numerics , since there can not be ( by definition ) quasiparticles faster than the cft ones .",
    "we already discussed that the numerical results for a defect at the boundary of the slit is in _ quantitative _ agreement with the cft in the region @xmath84 .",
    "however for @xmath90 the numerics show an asymptotic value that appears to be exactly that of the ground state . accordingly to our analysis this is possible only when the boundary entropy @xmath25 vanishes .",
    "the most relevant qualitative difference is that for @xmath46 greater than the maximum length the asymptotic result is not constant but it is slowly decaying ( like @xmath130 ) smoothing the sharp transition from the plateau .",
    "this , for example , changes completely the behavior in the case of central defect .",
    "we expect that this phenomenon can be ascribed to the slow quasiparticles that , after the quickest ones have arrived entangling the two parts , then disentangle them for very long times .",
    "this is the most plausible explanation , but we do not have an argument to put it on a more quantitative level .",
    "in this section we derive the time - dependence of correlation functions after the local quench .",
    "we find that the one - point function whose functional form is completely fixed by conformal invariance .",
    "the two - point functions instead depend on the particular ( boundary ) cft .",
    "we will discuss all the details in the simplest case of a gaussian theory and then show how from general cft arguments we can obtain part of the asymptotic behavior .",

    "thus we have that for @xmath143 the two - point function keeps its initial value that has a different form depending on the relative signs of @xmath144 given by @xmath145 ( different sides of the defect ) and @xmath146 ( same side ) .    for @xmath147 , it reaches the ground state value @xmath148 .",
    "an interesting and non - trivial behavior is displayed for @xmath149 when ( r_1,t ) ( r_2,t)=^x_.      there are some features of the previous result that are expected to be valid in general , not only for a gaussian theory , as for example the the horizon effect and the final equilibrated value .",
    "the natural expectation is that these results are obtainable with cft and in fact we will show that this is the case .",
    "the two - point function in the half - plane can be always written as @xcite ( w_1 ) ( w_2 ) = ( ) ^x _ f ( ) , [ 2ptgen ] where @xmath150 is the four - point ratio = , and the function @xmath151 depends explicitly on the considered ( boundary ) model .",
    "it is known for the simplest models as e.g. the gaussian ( @xmath152 ) and the ising universality class ( see below ) .",
    "thus the behavior of the two - point function depends mainly on the value on the ratio @xmath150 that we now study . using the analytic structure of the previous section we have for @xmath143 a different behavior",
    "if the two points are on the same or on different sides of the defect : ( t<|r_2|)= for intermediate times we have ( |r_2|<t < r_1)= , while for larger times @xmath150 is @xmath133 constantly .    from the previous subsection",
    "we already know how the first part of eq .",
    "( [ 2ptgen ] ) transforms under the conformal mapping ( [ mapp1 ] ) .",
    "thus we need only to map @xmath151 that , in general , is an unknown function",
    ". however we know its behavior in two special circumstances .",
    "indeed when @xmath153 the two points are deep in the bulk , meaning @xmath154 . instead for @xmath155 , from the short - distance expansion , we have f()(a^_b)^2^x_b , where @xmath156 is the boundary scaling dimension of the leading boundary operator to which @xmath138 couples and @xmath132 is the bulk - boundary operator product expansion coefficient that equals the one introduced in eq .",
    "( [ onepoint ] ) [ see e.g. @xcite ] .",
    "from this we easily understand the behavior for @xmath147 .",
    "since @xmath157 so @xmath154 , the two - point function is just the one in the ground state ( r_1<t ) ( |r_2|<t)=1|r_1-r_2|^2 x_. although this result could have been expected , it is important to have recovered it only from cft arguments .",
    "the behavior for @xmath158 is instead more complicated : combining the result of the previuos section with the value of @xmath150 we have ( r_1,t ) ( r_2,t)=^x _ f ( ) . for example when @xmath138 is the order parameter in the ising universality class we have @xcite f()= , [ deff ] and @xmath159 .",
    "the sign @xmath160 depends on the boundary conditions .",
    "@xmath161 corresponds to fixed boundary conditions and and @xmath162 to free ones .",
    "this completely fixes the behavior of the two - point function in the intermediate regime .",
    "it would be very interesting to check this prediction .",
    "the time evolution for @xmath143 depends on the sign of @xmath142 .",
    "for @xmath163 we have ( r_1,t ) ( r_2,t)=^x _",
    "f ( ) , i.e. it keeps its inital value until @xmath164 , that is nothing but correct boundary value at zero time .",
    "more complicated is the behavior for @xmath165 , in fact we get @xmath166 and the behavior of @xmath151 for @xmath167 .",
    "in particular we note that this is time independent only when @xmath168 , which corresponds to the case of a non - zero 1-point function .",
    "similar anomalous time - behavior was found when @xmath169 in ref .",
    "a natural question arising is how the results we just derived change when we introduce more than one defect in the line .",
    "it is straightforward to have a path integral for the density matrix : we only need to have pairs of slits for @xmath49 to @xmath170 and from @xmath171 to @xmath172 everywhere there is a defect .",
    "however it becomes prohibitively difficult to treat this case analytically . in order to begin to understand the case when a finite interval interval is initially decoupled",
    ", we consider the case when it lies at the end of a half - line .",
    "so , let us consider a semi - infinite chain in which the a subsystem is the finite segment @xmath173 and the b is the complement @xmath174 and with the initial defect at @xmath60 .",
    "the space - time geometry describing this situation is like the one just considered , with a wall at @xmath175 ( @xmath176 real ) that represents the boundary condition .",
    "this is depicted in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ map2 ] .    in these circumstances",
    "the inverse conformal mapping between the @xmath57 plane and the half - plane can be worked out using the schwarz - christoffel formula .",
    "after long algebra one obtains z(w)=i((iw)+b ) , [ exmap ] with the parameter @xmath177 related to @xmath8 and @xmath40 in a non - algebraic way .",
    "( a slit in the full line is closely related to this transformation , the last piece is replaced by @xmath178 . ) unfortunately the mapping ( [ exmap ] ) is not analytically invertible and its exact use is limited to numerical calculations that do not help us , since we need to perform an analytical continuation .",
    "we will develop in the remaining part of the section an approximate solution for @xmath179 , that however is not always justified : this limit is allowed only _ after _ the analytical continuation to real time .",
    "the limit @xmath180 before the analytical continuation simplifies the calculation because under the conformal transformation ( [ mapp1 ] ) the boundary at @xmath181 is approximately a disk tangent to the imaginary axis at the origin and with radius @xmath182 , as depicted in the central part of fig .",
    "this is simply checked applying the inverse transformation ( [ mapp1 ] ) to the disk @xmath183 with @xmath184 $ ] .",
    "in fact we have z== = -- i /2",
    "the half - plane minus the disk @xmath185 is mapped in the half - plane @xmath186 by the transformation w =- i(2i r/ ) .",
    "[ mapp2 ] let us note that when @xmath106 , the parameter @xmath177 is given by @xmath187 .    combining the two transformations we can map the space - time region on the left of fig .",
    "[ map2 ] into the half - plane ( only in the limit @xmath180 ) by means of w =- i , with inverse z(w)=i(iw)+ i .",
    "note that the residue of the pole at @xmath188 is the same as the exact one in eq .",
    "( [ exmap ] ) . furthermore , calculating the the difference between the approximate and the exact solution , one easily checks that it is of the order of @xmath189 everywhere in the complex plane .",
    "we then have that @xmath190 can be written as w(i)=-ie^/2 . thus",
    "note that for @xmath191 it reduces to the previous result , as it should .",
    "furthermore , it is clear that it is well defined only for @xmath192 .",
    "continuing to real time @xmath68 , and for @xmath69 we have _ n(i)=_n ^x_n .",
    "clearly this can not make sense when the argument of the power - law becomes negative ( i.e. for @xmath193 ) , signaling that there is something wrong in the derivation .",
    "however , using the replica trick , for the entanglement entropy we obtain s_a=(t(t/2))+_1 .",
    "[ s2 ] one is tempted to assume that this result can be correct only for @xmath84 and that for larger time it saturates as suggested by the quasiparticle interpretation .",
    "only an exact calculation via the exact mapping ( [ exmap ] ) can resolve these doubts .",
    "however exact solutions of integrable models or numerical density matrix renormalization group could already be able to eventually exclude eq .",
    "( [ s2 ] ) and to shed some light on the problem .",
    "we mainly mention this topic here to encourage further studies in this direction .",
    "finally let us point out that transformations similar to eq .",
    "( [ exmap ] ) appear when studying finite - size effects .",
    "we presented a detailed study of the unitary evolution that results after a local quench in a quantum one - dimensional system .",
    "all our findings have been obtained by means of cft and so they are limited to the evolution of a gapless quantum model with a linear dispersion relation .",
    "we presented calculations for the entanglement entropies for different bipartitions of the system and for one- and two - point correlation functions in a general cft .",
    "in particular we studied the case when two half - systems are joined at time @xmath13 .",
    "all our results are interpretable in terms of a scenario that we believe to be valid in general , not only for gapless systems ( in analogy to the case of global quenches @xcite ) . in fact",
    ", the initial state is expected to generate quasiparticle excitations at @xmath60 that then propagate freely through the system and carry all the information about entanglement and correlations . in the case of a cft",
    "all these excitations travel at the same speed @xmath80 ( @xmath194 by normalization ) . however in general , as a consequence of a non - linear dispersion relation , a full spectrum of velocities is expected .",
    "although the physical cut may seem a rather specific situation , we believe that our findings are quite general .",
    "for example , a general defect ( e.g. a weakened bond ) is asymptotically equivalent to the results we obtained here as long as the defect is a relevant perturbation .",
    "this excludes the xx chain that is the only model studied so far @xcite , where the defect is believed to be marginal @xcite , but should apply to xxz spin - chains @xcite .",
    "furthermore we expect a qualitatively similar behavior when a system has been artificially prepared in a configuration that is only locally different from the ground state .",
    "for example there are already several studies where the local horizon effect is evident ( see e.g. those considered in refs .",
    "a full quantitative analysis of most of these settings should be possible properly adapting our cft treatment ( e.g. with the theory of boundary condition changing operators @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , also the case of an initial state with one or more kinks displays a time - evolution with an horizon effect similar to the one considered here ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite where also finite temperature results are obtained in a rigorous manner ) .",
    "it would be interesting to understand whether these results can be recovered analytically continuing some cft results .",
    "work in this direction is in progress .",
    "we described here several different physical situations , but many problems are still left for future investigations .",
    "a first goal would be to check our predictions in exactly solvable models .",
    "in fact , as far as we are aware only the paper by eisler and peschel @xcite discussed these topics in the context of the xx model and their results are fully compatible with ours .",
    "another simple generalization of our results is to study gapped exactly solvable models , like the ising model in a transverse magnetic field or others admitting a free - field representation . in these case",
    "it is also interesting to understand whether some predictions can be made on the basis of the generalized gibbs ensemble @xcite .    a more difficult question to study analytically concerns the role played by quenched disorder .",
    "this is expected to change at a qualitative level the quasiparticle scenario as a consequence of anderson localization @xcite . in this case",
    "the time - dependent density matrix renormalization group @xcite should be quite effective , since for clean systems we know that the entanglement entropy never increases dramatically as it does in the case of global quenches .",
