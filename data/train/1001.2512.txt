    "the contemporary explosion of information arising from high - resolution spectroscopic studies of metal - poor stars in the galaxy is re - shaping our understanding of the nature of the nucleosynthesis processes that took place during the early stellar generations . among the most interesting are detailed follow - up observations of stars exhibiting large over - abundances of carbon ( @xmath60.5  @xmath7[c / fe]@xmath84.0 ) , an apparently common occurance among metal - poor stars @xcite .",
    "it has been reported that a large fraction , at least 20@xmath4 , of stars with metallicities [ fe / h ] = @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the number density of atoms of a given element , and the indices refers to the star ( @xmath11 ) and the sun ( @xmath12).]@xmath7@xmath02.0 , exhibit large over - abundances of carbon ( [ c / fe]@xmath13@xmath61.0 ; * ? ? ?",
    "the fraction of so - called carbon - enhanced metal - poor ( cemp ) stars rises to 30@xmath4 for [ fe / h]@xmath7@xmath03.0 , 40@xmath4 for [ fe / h]@xmath7@xmath03.5 , and 100@xmath4 for [ fe / h]@xmath7@xmath04.0 @xcite .",
    "however , there are also recent studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) claiming that this fraction is somewhat lower ( 9@xmath4 and 14@xmath4 , respectively ) .",
    "this variety of claims is one of the motivations for obtaining reliable determinations of metallicities and carbon abundances for a larger number of stars .",
    "furthermore , the identification of ( in particular , brighter ) cemp stars will play a major role in theoretical work on the subject @xcite , as they will enable the high - resolution spectroscopic follow - up required to derive the abundance patterns of additional elements , and thereby test suggested astrophysical sites that might be associated with the carbon production .",
    "the vast majority of known cemp stars were originally identified as metal - poor candidates from objective - prism surveys , such as the hk survey of beers and colleagues @xcite , and the hamburg / eso survey ( he s ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , both of which were based on the presence of weak ( or absent ) lines of caii .",
    "a list of he s stars with strong molecular lines of carbon has been previously published by @xcite .",
    "medium - resolution spectra for most of these objects have been obtained over the past few years @xcite .",
    "inspection of these data indicate that at least 50@xmath4 of these targets are consistent with identification as cemp stars , while the others are roughly solar - metallicity carbon - rich stars . however , this previous set of carbon - rich candidates was selected based on the _ sum _ of molecular carbon lines , such as cn , c@xmath14 , and ch , which over - emphasizes cooler stars in the sample .",
    "cemp stars with effective temperatures higher than about 5500  k often only exhibit unusual strengths of just a single carbon feature , the ch g - band at 4300 , and were likely to have been missed in the previous assembly . since most previous cemp stars have been discovered by targeting low - metallicity candidates , this has resulted in a biasing of the resulting samples of carbon - rich stars to [ fe / h]@xmath7@xmath02.5 ; it would clearly be useful to extend the metallicity range for their discovery to higher values",
    ".    for most cemp stars there exists a clear correlation between carbon enhancement and the presence of s - process - element over - abundances , such as for ba ( cemp - s stars - see * ? ? ?",
    "such behavior is consistent with the hypothesis that these enhancements ( both for carbon and the s - process elements ) are due to nucleosynthesis processes that took place during the asymptotic giant - branch stage of evolution , either from the star itself ( which should rarely be found , but see * ? ? ? * ) or by a now - extinct binary companion that has transferred material to a surviving ( observed ) component @xcite .",
    "however , recent studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have shown that this correlation no longer persists ( or at least is different in nature ) for stars with [ fe / h]@xmath7@xmath02.7 , including all of the most iron - deficient stars known to date : he  0107 - 5240 (  [ fe / h]=@xmath05.3 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , he  1327 - 2326 (  [ fe / h]=@xmath05.4 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and he  0557 - 4840 (  [ fe / h]=@xmath04.75 ; * ? ? ?",
    "these so - called cemp - no stars ( indicating a lack of s - process - element over - abundances ) , and the other categories of cemp stars that have been noted @xcite , suggest that a variety of mechanisms for the production of carbon must have played a role in the early universe .",
    "furthermore , due to the aforementioned metallicity - dependent selection bias , many of the cemp stars known to date may be associated with the outer - halo population , which exhibits a peak metallicity of [ fe / h ] @xmath152.2 @xcite .",
    "additional cemp stars that are likely to be associated with the inner - halo and metal - weak thick - disk populations , which extend to higher metallicities , are required to investigate possible differences in their origins ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the primary goal of the present work is to demonstrate the efficacy of searching for intermediate - metallicity cemp stars , through the use of a new approach for their identification .",
    "the inclusion of warmer carbon - enhanced candidates ( which do not exhibit cn and c@xmath14 bands ) also enables investigations between the observed levels of carbon enhancement and evolutionary stage .",
    "it should also be kept in mind that the inventory of ultra (  [ fe / h]@xmath7@xmath164.0 ) and hyper (  [ fe / h]@xmath7@xmath05.0 ) metal - poor stars is likely to be incomplete .",
    "even if some of those extreme objects might not present carbon enhancements , this work uses the available data as a support to find candidates that meet our expectations .",
    "such extreme stars may have been overlooked in previous searches due to noisy spectra in the region of caii  k on objective - prism plates ( see * ? ? ? * for an alternative procedure to overcome this issue ) , but they could reveal themselves by the presence of strong ch g - bands that are commonly associated with the most iron - deficient stars .",
    "this paper is outlined as follows .",
    "the main features of the he s stellar database , and its specific application for the present work , are outlined in  [ database ] .",
    "section [ index ] considers the flaws of the current line index used by the he s to quantify the strength of the ch g - band , and provides a definition of a new , extended line index for the g - band .",
    "the first he s subsample of candidate cemp stars selected on the basis of this new index , and the criteria for candidate selection , are discussed in  [ selecand ] .",
    "section [ followup ] reports on medium - resolution follow - up spectra obtained with the soar 4.1 m telescope for 132 cemp candidates in this pilot investigation , along with determinations of their atmospheric parameters ( , , [ fe / h ] ) and carbon abundances ( [ c / fe ] ) .",
    "finally , our conclusions and perspectives for future observational follow - up are presented in  [ last ] .",
    "the hamburg / eso survey @xcite was the first all - southern sky quasar survey .",
    "the main motivation for the survey was to find the brightest quasars in the southern hemisphere , both for statistical studies and to identify the best targets for follow - up absorption line spectroscopy . due to the relatively high spectral resolution of the eso schmidt prism ( 15 at caii",
    "k ) , it was expected that interesting species of stars , such as metal - poor halo stars , carbon stars , cataclysmic variables , white dwarfs , horizontal - branch stars , and others ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , could be found as a byproduct .",
    "the he s prism survey was conducted with the 1 m eso schmidt telecope . with an effective area of 6726 deg@xmath17",
    ", it covers all the extragalactic ( @xmath18  30@xmath19 ) southern ( @xmath202.5@xmath19 ) portion of the sky .",
    "@xcite used the survey to increase the number of metal - poor stars known , compared to the hk survey , by a factor of about 3 - 5 , mainly due to the fainter magnitudes achieved ( @xmath21@xmath2217.5 ) .",
    "the total survey volume was increased by almost a factor of 10 , relative to the hk survey , but follow - up observations have not yet been obtained for all of the most interesting he s candidates .",
    "the wavelength coverage of the he s spectra is 3200 - 5300 , which includes the caii  k line ( 3933 , suitable for [ fe / h ] estimates - see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the ch g - band ( @xmath224300 ) .    the present work ( and additional investigations currently in progress ) have made use of the full he s stellar database ( 4,404,908 objects ) .",
    "it is most helpful to work with a single and homogeneous sample of targets , in order to test our new index definitions and still have a relevant number of candidates for future analysis .",
    "another important point is that the he s has had a number of published high - resolution studies that include cemp stars ( such as * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which can be used for comparison .",
    "previous medium - resolution spectroscopic analyses employed a 15 wide g - band index ( gp ) , as defined by @xcite ; a similar index was originally defined by @xcite , prior to the recognition that such large fractions of metal - poor stars would exhibit strong carbon enhancement .",
    "the gp index is a pseudo - equivalent width that measures the contrast between the observed spectra and the continuum level .",
    "it is represented by the area enclosed in a 15 wide line - band , delimited by a psedo - continuum , which is calculated using a linear fit between the center values of two side - bands , on both blue and red sides of the line - band .",
    "table [ indexlist ] lists the wavelength ranges for some of the g - band indices found in the literature .",
    "the need for a new index is clear , as it has been shown in several studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that the 15 wide line band does not capture all of the flux absorbed by carbon - related features in the region of the ch g - band .",
    "in addition , the gp index suffers contamination of its sidebands when a given star is particularly carbon - rich , or at low effective temperatures , given that a linear fit severely underestimates the level of the continuum for those objects .",
    "@cccc@[!ht ] gp & 4247.0 - 4267.0 & 4297.5 - 4312.5 & 4362.0 - 4372.0 + gphes & 4246.0 - 4255.0 & 4281.0 - 4307.0 & 4446.0 - 4612.0 + gpe & & 4200.0 - 4400.0 &    @xcite defined a new g - band index for use with the scanned he s spectra , gphes , of width 26 , calibrated to be on a similar scale as the gp index .",
    "however , as can be appreciated from inspection of figure [ example ] , even this new , wider index is not sufficient for some of the more extreme cemp candidates identifed in the he s . a new index for",
    "this particular carbon feature should cover not only the classical g - band ( centered at 4304 ) , but also the portion of the spectrum that extends out into the wings of the region , which is affected by other carbon features ( such as c@xmath14 , which are often exhibited even by warmer cemp stars ) .",
    "note that even when a star does not have strong carbon ( i.e. , exhibits a weak or `` normal '' g - band ) , such an index should still remain valid , since there will not be much signal from other features inside the band ( except for the h@xmath23 balmer line at 4340 ; see below ) .",
    "the gpe ( gphes _ extended _ ) index is defined as follows :    @xmath24    where @xmath25 represents the observed spectrum and @xmath26 is the local continuum .",
    "this definition is similar to that of @xcite , but here we do not estimate the continuum level by side - band interpolations , since the presence of the carbon features can also affect those regions and thereby compromise the index .",
    "we experimented with a variety of fitting approaches for the continuum , including the same procedures originally adopted for the gp and gphes indices .",
    "the final choice is based on the techniques employed by the segue stellar parameter pipeline ( sspp - see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for a detailed description of the procedure ) , adjusted to work at the resolution of the he s spectra .",
    "figure [ example ] shows a typical ( cool ) carbon - enhanced star spectrum from the scanned he s plates .",
    "the narrow area around 4300 shows the location of the gphes index , which is wider ( and shifted slightly to the blue region ) than the gp index .",
    "the new gpe index line band is represented by the 200 wide region around the same location .",
    "figure [ example ] shows that the gphes index band is too narrow to be representative of the strength of the entire feature , and its sidebands are contaminated as well .",
    "similar comments apply to the gp index .    from our own inspection ,",
    "the optimal definition of the new index covers the range 4200 - 4400 .",
    "the gpe index does encompass the h@xmath23 balmer line at 4340 , but this should not represent a problem , since this balmer line will be present in carbon - normal stars as well ; its strength should scale in the same way with temperature for both carbon - normal and carbon - rich stars . in the definition of gpe",
    ", the continuum shape plays an especially important role , since it must be well - fit over the entire region ( rather than estimated from more isolated sidebands ) .",
    "the main goal of this pilot study is to test the new gpe index with the he s database , by comparing its ability to select cemp stars with available high - resolution analysis ( and hence known atmospheric parameters , and [ c / fe ] ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that are similar to the new stars we seek to identify for future follow - up survey efforts .",
    "we begin by obtaining gpe indices for a selected subsample of he s candidates , as well as for the he s stars studied by @xcite , and examine their behavior in a gpe versus ( j@xmath0k)@xmath27 diagram , where the near - infrared photometry is taken from 2mass @xcite . because most of the stars will be `` carbon - normal '' ( meaning the strength of the ch g - band scales with metallicity ) , rather than cemp stars , one can then identify the locus of stars with enhanced carbon based on their deviation from the trend associated with carbon - normal stars .      to identify our initial candidates ,",
    "the following criteria were applied to the he s database :    * ph@xmath28qual  =  aaa ( accurate jhk photometry from 2mass ) ; * objtype  =  stars ( removes extended and bright sources ) ; * kphes @xmath7 8.0 ( removes stars with clearly too strong caii  k lines for a metal - poor star , regardless of their effective temperature ) ; * bhes @xmath7 15.5 ( bright - object selection , for observations with the soar telescope ) ; * 0.15 @xmath29 ( j@xmath0k)@xmath27  @xmath29 0.90 ( color range suitable for abundance analysis ) .",
    "this first set of constraints yielded 85894 raw candidates .",
    "the gpe index was calculated for those candidates , as well as for low - resolution spectra of the he s stars in @xcite , which are confirmed cemp stars .",
    "figure [ combo ] shows the distribution of the gpe index , as a function of ( j@xmath0k)@xmath27 color , for the raw candidates ( small gray dots ) and for the @xcite stars ( black filled circles ) . the ( j@xmath0k)@xmath27 color was chosen as a proxy for temperature , since this variable greatly influences the strength of molecular carbon features , such as cn , c@xmath14 , ch , as well as the hydrogen balmer lines .",
    "the index works because , for a given value of ( j@xmath0k)@xmath27 , the cemp stars will have higher gpe values than the ones without enhancements .    based on the location of the known carbon - enhanced stars on this diagram , relative to the locus of carbon - normal stars , a lower limit on gpe was set at 30 , reducing the number of candidates to 6018 stars .",
    "we are aware that possible candidates may be missed by this restriction , but this value is a compromise between obtaining a satisfatory number of candidates to explore for new cemp stars and the time spent on the follow - up observations .",
    "if the limiting value was chosen at gpe  =  35 , the yield would be only 1883 candidates .",
    "similarly , going as low as gpe  =  25 , the number would rise to 26313 candidates .",
    "one of the primary reasons for the use of a new index is that the gphes index , as it is calculated for the he s stars , is likely to be saturated , or have its sidebands contaminated from strong carbon features .",
    "figure [ compara ] shows the values for both indices for the first subsample .",
    "one can clearly notice that a deviation from a linear relation between the two indices occurs , especially for the higher values of gpe ( which are also the stars with redder ( j@xmath0k)@xmath27 , as seen in figure [ combo ] ) .",
    "it is also obvious that the gpe index enjoys a greater dynamical range than the gphes index , which is crucial when one considers the effects of errors on the measurement of these indices .",
    "small measurement errors impact the gphes index far more than the gpe index is expected to be perturbed ( owing to its larger width and better - defined continuum ) .",
    "since the restrictions made above do not take into account any cuts on s / n ratio , nor can they distinguish between satisfactory measurements of he s spectra and possible difficulties due to plate artifacts , overlapping spectra , etc .",
    ", a careful inspection of each prism spectrum is necessary , as discussed below .      to validate the index calculations , a visual inspection of the digitized he s spectra",
    "was made for candidate stars with gpe  @xmath30 30 in order to : ( 1 ) assign classifications to the stars based on the strength of the caii  k line and the presence of hydrogen balmer lines , or clear molecular carbon bands and ( 2 ) rule out spurious values of gpe originating from overlapping spectra , emulsion scratches , or border effects on the photographic plates .",
    "table [ canclass ] lists the distribution of the sample of 6018 candidates , according to the main assigned classes .",
    "the behavior of the new index for all classes ( excluding low s / n spectra and errors due to overlaps and artifacts on the photographic plates ) is shown in figure [ comp ] .",

    "they came into the sample due to the fact that the strong h@xmath23 line ( 4340 ) contributes significantly to the gpe line index . for redder colors , ( j@xmath0k)@xmath27 @xmath13 0.3",
    ", the strength of the balmer line decreases with temperature , so the enhancement of the line index is no longer a serious issue . on the red end of the color scale",
    ", one sees that the _ unid _ stars are concentrated in the ( j@xmath0k)@xmath27 @xmath13 0.7 region .",
    "these are cool stars , with little signal in the blue end of the spectrum , hence it is difficult to identify ( and estimate the strength of ) the caii  k line on the original prism spectra .",
    "one difficulty with the selection described above is that the candidate sample is dominated by a large number of stars with strong caii  k features , many of which may be more metal - rich than the cemp stars we seek to identify . to reduce the number of these objects , we adopt a relaxed version of the selection of @xcite in the kp index versus ( j@xmath0k)@xmath27 or bvhes color parameter space .",
    "a metallicity cutoff of [ fe / h ] = @xmath02.0 , instead of the [ fe / h ] = @xmath02.5 limit used by the he s metal - poor star selection , was chosen .",
    "note that errors in the measurement of the kp index ensures that ( due to their great numbers ) many stars with @xmath32 } { } } \\le -1.0 $ ] will still enter our sample .",
    "had we raised the cutoff in the selection closer to [ fe / h ] @xmath33 , the numbers of higher - abundance stars would become prohibitive .",
    "figure [ kpcutoff ] shows the distribution of stars with strong caii k  lines ( _ mpcc _ ) for both colors and the adjusted polynomials .",
    "the final selection of cemp candidates includes all stars with absent ( _ mpca _ ) , weak ( _ mpcb _ ) or not found ( _ unid _  ) caii  k lines , objects with strong carbon molecular bands ( _ fhlc _ ) , and also the _ mpcc _ stars with kp indices that are below at least one of the kp cutoffs ( gray dots on figure [ kpcutoff ] ) .",
    "after this step , a search was performed on the full candidate list , and all of the already - known objects ( from previous he s selection , including the metal - poor stars and known carbon - enhanced stars ) were removed .",
    "this procedure yielded a list of 669 cemp newly identified candidate cemp stars .",
    "validation of our selected cemp candidates is an important part of this pilot study . for this purpose",
    "we have obtained medium - resolution optical spectra for a limited number of cemp candidates with the soar 4.1 m telescope . after gathering and reducing the data",

    "details of the observations , reduction procedures , and further analysis are provided below .",
    "medium - resolution spectra for the first 132 of our 669 cemp candidates were obtained with the new goodman high - throughput spectrograph on the soar 4.1 m telescope , over the course of early science verification for this instrument .",
    "the goodman spectrograph operates with several different observing modes .",
    "we employed the 600 l / mm grating in the blue setting ( wavelength range 3550 - 5500 ) with a 1.03 \" slit .",
    "this resulted in a resolving power of @xmath341500 ( resolution of @xmath223.5 ) .",
    "this resolution was chosen due to its similarity to spectra obtained during the sloan digital sky survey @xcite , for which the sspp was designed to work .",
    "the calibration frames include biases , quartz flats , as well as hgar and cu arc lamp exposures taken following each program object s observation .",
    "the exposure times for most of the observed stars were in the range of 10 - 20 minutes ( targeting an `` as - observed '' s / n @xmath35 in the region of the ch g - band ) .",

    "the last two columns refer to the carbon abundance ratios and estimated errors , respectively , obtained by the procedures discussed below .",
    "the radial velocities calculated for the standard stars in our program presented unexpectedly large errors ( on the order of 50 km / s ) , which we suspect are due to poorly corrected flexure of the goodman spectrograph during commissioning .",
    "we used different techniques for this procedure ( including line - by - line estimates and cross - correlation analysis ) to assure that large - than - desired errors were not due to analysis issues .",
    "since the velocities for the program stars are not known in advance , similar errors are expected .",
    "this does not present a major issue for our particular application , since the sspp requires only a rough estimate of the radial velocity to perform its calculations .",

    "it is interesting to note that the two prominent peaks at low metallicity lie rather close to the peak metallicities that @xcite associate with the outer - halo (  [ fe / h ] = @xmath02.2 ) and inner - halo (  [ fe / h ] = @xmath01.6 ) populations .",

    "if one considers only the very metal - poor stars ( [ fe / h]@xmath7@xmath02.0 ) , the fraction increases to 43@xmath4 .",
    "for the five observed candidates that present estimated metallicities significantly lower than [ fe / h ] = @xmath02.5 , our method reached 80@xmath4 success .",
    "it is worth noting that the majority of metal - poor stars in our candidate pool with [ fe / h ]  @xmath51.0 ( 51@xmath4 ) present considerable carbon enhancements ( [ c / fe ]  @xmath370.5 ) .",
    "we have developed a new line index for the region of the carbon g - band at 4304 , gpe , which has the advantage of capturing more information concerning the abundance of carbon , since its width takes into account the wings of the band , which includes other nearby carbon features .",
    "furthermore , it is not subject to confounding ( as were previously employed narrower indices ) due to sidebands that fall in regions of the spectrum for which carbon features are present . to test this new method",
    ", we obtained a sample of stars from the he s stellar database , and compared the newly calculated index with the ones for confirmed carbon - rich stars based on high - resolution analysis @xcite .",
    "medium - resolution spectra for a sample of 132 stars selected by this procedure have been obtained with the goodman spectrograph on the soar 4.1 m telescope .",
    "our new selection technique achieves a success rate for newly identified cemp stars of 43% for stars with [ fe / h ]  @xmath52.0 ; four out of five candidates with [ fe / h ]  @xmath52.5 exhibit high carbon enhancements [ c / fe ]  @xmath371.0 .",
    "it should be kept in mind that these values are not unbiased estimates of the fractions of cemp stars , rather , they indicate the efficacy of our new approach for the identification of likely carbon - enhanced stars .    we plan to continue our survey for unrecognized cemp stars , based on this new selection scheme , with the goal of reaching a total sample of @xmath221000 such stars . in the past , cemp stars were either selected as ( 1 ) candidate metal - poor stars from the hk survey or he s based on the apparent weakness of their caii  k lines ( and then later found to be cemp stars based on medium - resolution spectroscopic follow - up ) , or ( 2 ) were selected as carbon - rich stars on the basis of the _ sum _ of various carbon features in their prism spectra @xcite . both of these techniques have limitations . technique ( 1 )",
    "clearly misses warmer cemp stars with metallicity [ fe / h ]  @xmath382.5 , and ( due to the color range used in the selection ) misses cemp stars with estimated @xmath39 0.9 , as the presence of strong lines of carbon `` reddens '' the inferred colors outside of the selection window .",
    "technique ( 2 ) identifies mostly very cool carbon - rich stars , since it targets a threshold for the total strength of carbon features in a stellar spectrum .",
    "even stars with quite strong ch g - bands often fail to meet the selection threshold , if they are warm enough to not exhibit cn and c@xmath14 bands .",
    "the expanded list of cemp stars we seek to identify will enable more detailed studies at high spectral resolution , in order to assign them into their proper sub - classes , and to determine the full set of elemental abundances needed in order to explore the astrophysical sites associated with the carbon production .",
