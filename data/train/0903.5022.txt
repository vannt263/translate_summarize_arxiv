    "nonlocal conserved charges play the central role in quantum integrability @xcite . for the superstring in @xmath0",
    "their existence was proven in the classical sigma - model in @xcite using the green - schwarz - metsaev - tseytlin formalism , and in @xcite using the pure spinor formalism .",
    "the existence of the nonlocal conserved charges at the quantum level was proven in @xcite .",
    "the most important feature of the string worldsheet @xmath2-model ( besides the conformal invariance ) is the existence of the brst structure .",
    "the physically meaningful constructions should respect the action of the brst operator @xmath3 .",
    "the nonlocal conserved charges of @xcite are only brst invariant up to the boundary terms . to be more precise , we need to introduce the transfer matrix which is the generating function of the nonlocal conserved charges . for an open contour @xmath4 connecting points @xmath5 and @xmath6 on the string worldsheet",
    ":        we define the transfer matrix : @xmath7 = p\\exp \\left ( -\\int^b_a j[z ] \\right)\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is a contour connecting points @xmath5 and @xmath6 on the string worldsheet , and @xmath8 is a representation of @xmath9 .",
    "the currents @xmath10 $ ] depend on the spectral parameter @xmath11 and the representation @xmath8 .",
    "the transfer matrix is a function of the _ spectral parameter _",
    "it is the generating function of the conserved charges",
    ". it can be also though of as the wilson line operator corresponding to the flat connection @xmath10 $ ] on the string worldsheet . in this paper",
    "we will use both expressions : `` transfer matrix '' and `` wilson line '' , and understand them as synonyms .",
    "the brst variation of the wilson line @xmath12 $ ] results in the boundary terms . using the notations of @xcite : @xmath13(z ) & = & \\left ( { 1\\over z } \\varepsilon\\lambda_3(b ) + z \\varepsilon\\lambda_1(b ) \\right )   t[c_a^b](z ) - \\nonumber \\\\ & & - t[c_a^b](z ) \\left ( { 1\\over z } \\varepsilon\\lambda_3(a ) +",
    "z \\varepsilon\\lambda_1(a ) \\right ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this equation is very interesting .",
    "nontrivial boundary terms in ( [ boundarytermsinbrst ] ) allow to `` bootstrap '' at least at the classical level the structure of @xmath14@xmath15 matrices , see section 7 of @xcite . on the other hand , these boundary terms present a problem : the nonlocal conserved charges are not physical quantities , at least not in an obvious sense .",
    "( because they are not in the kernel of @xmath3 . )",
    "what should we do with them ?      a natural thing to try is to find an operator which when inserted at the endpoint of the wilson line would make it @xmath3-closed .",
    "this is somewhat analogous to the open wilson line in qcd .",
    "the expression @xmath16 is unphysical , because it is not gauge invariant .",
    "the physical quantity is : @xmath17 we may call @xmath18 and @xmath19 `` the plugs '' because they fix `` leaking boundary terms '' in gauge tranformations , or in brst transformations .",
    "can we find similar plugs for the wilson line on the string worldsheet in @xmath0 ?",
    "in this paper we will report a progress in this direction .",
    "remember that the wilson line depends on a choice of representation ; we have to choose a representation @xmath8 of @xmath20 .",
    "consider the space of states of the linearized supergravity multiplet in @xmath0 .",
    "it splits into the direct sum of infinitely many infinite - dimensional irreducible representations of @xmath20 , each corresponding to a bps state .",
    "we will argue that when @xmath8 is one of those infinite - dimensional bps representations , then there is a suitable plug of the ghost number 2 .",
    "this is closely related to the vertex operators for the massless states in @xmath0 .",
    "in fact we will relate the brst cohomology complex corresponding to the endpoint of the wilson line to the brst complex corresponding to the vertex operators .",
    "this is essentially an example of the frobenius reciprocity .",
    "the main nontrivial point is the construction of the vertex operators transforming _ strictly covariantly _ under the global supersymmetries of @xmath0 .",
    "this is different from flat space where massless vertices transform covariantly only up to brst exact terms .",
    "wilson lines in infinite - dimensional representations played an important role in the integrable context in @xcite in the construction of the q - operator .",
    "they also played an important role in the ads / cft context in @xcite for the interpretation of the ym feynman diagramms in the string worldsheet theory .",
    "consider an infinite - dimensional irreducible representation @xmath21 of @xmath20 .",
    "it is natural to ask the question : @xmath22 the results of our paper imply that this answer can be answered directly in terms of the structure of @xmath21 , as a representation of @xmath20 .",
    "namely , given @xmath21 , we consider the following complex : @xmath23 defined entirely in terms of @xmath21  see section [ sec : definitionofalgebraiccomplex ] .",

    "we give a geometrical definition of vertex operators using the representation of @xmath0 as the coset space @xmath26 . in section [ sec : definitionofcovariantvertex ] we explain what it means for the vertex to be strictly covariant , and then in sections [ sec : taylorseries ] and [ sec : cohomologicalargument ] prove the existence of such covariant vertices . in section [ sec : flatspacelimit ]",
    "we discuss the flat space limit of our construction .",
    "( although it is impossible to construct the strictly covariant vertex in the flat space , but nevertheless the construction in @xmath0 has a well - defined flat space limit , which does transforms strictly covariantly , but only under a subgroup @xmath27 . ) in section",
    "[ sec : relationtoendpoint ] we explain how the covariant vertex plugs the endpoint of the wilson line . in section [ sec : applications ] we present some consequences of our construction ; we explain how to prepare the vertex operator depending on the spectral parameter .",
    "the algebra of supersymmetries of @xmath0 has a @xmath28 grading : @xmath29 we denote @xmath30 the universal enveloping algebra of @xmath31 .",
    "let @xmath32 denote the group element of @xmath30 , _",
    "i.e. _ an element of the group @xmath33 : @xmath34 where @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",

    "the generators of @xmath9 are the same as in @xcite : @xmath41 } \\in { \\bf g}_{\\bar{0}}\\ ] ]    for a vector space @xmath42 we will denote @xmath43 the dual vector space . in particular , the space of states is denoted @xmath21 and the space of linear functionals on the states is denoted @xmath44 .",
    "we will mostly consider the linear functionals which are the values of some supergravity fields ( such as the ramond - ramond field strength ) at a fixed point in @xmath0 .",
    "these could be also thought of as non - normalizable elements of @xmath21 , `` delta - functions type of states '' in @xmath21 .    for an even vector space @xmath42",
    "we denote @xmath45 the space of antisymmetric tensors . for an odd vector space @xmath45 will stand for symmetric tensors .",
    "example : @xmath46 is an odd vector space , and @xmath47 is the dual space . therefore @xmath48 is identified with the fifth order polynomials of some bosonic spinor variable @xmath49 .",

    "the gauge transformations are : @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the parameters of the gauge transformations .",
    "the brst operator is : @xmath76 our definition of the vertex is slightly weaker than the definition of @xcite .",
    "the definition of @xcite requires that : @xmath77 the only nonzero component of the vertex remains @xmath78 .",
    "in fact @xmath79 and @xmath80 are always @xmath81-exact .",
    "therefore the condition ( [ ghostnumbergauge ] ) can always be satisfied by adding to the vertex something @xmath82-exact . in this sense",
    "the components @xmath79 and @xmath80 can always be `` gauged away '' .",
    "but we want the _ covariant _ vertex operator .",
    "we suspect that it might be impossible to gauge away @xmath79 and @xmath80 in a covariant way .",
    "this is the reason why we prefer to allow these components in the definition of the vertex operator .",
    "in string theory vertex operators represent states .",
    "vertex operators are functions @xmath83 .",
    "the global symmetries act on @xmath40 and @xmath84 , and therefore act on vertex operators .    on the other hand , the global symmetries act on the space of states .",
    "therefore the action of the global symmetry group on states should agree with the action on vertex operators .",
    "naively , this would imply that if @xmath85 is a vertex operator corresponding to the state @xmath86 then @xmath87 but in fact this formula , generally speaking , holds only up to brst - trivial corrections ( terms which are @xmath3 of something ) .",
    "note that @xmath85 is not defined unambiguously , because we could add to it brst - exact terms and get physically equivalent vertex .",
    "we will prove that in @xmath0 it is possible to use this freedom in the definition of @xmath88 and choose @xmath88 so that it transforms covariantly , as in ( [ transformscovariantly ] ) . in our proof",
    "we will use the fact that vertices corresponding to supergravity states _ exist_.",
    "this was proven in @xcite . given the existence of the vertex",
    ", we will prove that it is always possible to correct it by a brst - exact expression , if necessary , to get a _",

    "the first example of the covariant vertex was given in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the _ zero mode _",

    "the corresponding marginal deformation of the action changes the radius of @xmath0 .",
    "the radius is invariant under the global symmetries , therefore in this case covariance means invariance ; the vertex ( [ zeromodevertex ] ) is invariant under the global symmetries .",
    "this is related to the fact that the action of the pure spinor superstring in @xmath0 is exactly invariant under the global symmetries ( while the action in flat space is invariant only up to adding a total derivative ) .",
    "our construction can be considered a generalization of ( [ zeromodevertex ] ) for fields with nontrivial dependence on @xmath40 and @xmath84 .",
    "the second example will be presented in the forthcoming paper with o.  bedoya , l.  bevilqua , and v.o .",

    "notice that ( [ vbeta ] ) is antisymmetric under the exchange of @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "therefore this vertex transforms in the antisymmetric product of two adjoint representations of @xmath20 .",
    "this antisymmetric product splits into two irreducible components .",
    "the first component is the adjoint representation .",
    "but the part of ( [ vbeta ] ) belonging to the adjoint representation is actually @xmath3-exact : @xmath94_c = \\nonumber \\\\ = \\varepsilon q_{brst } ( g^{-1 }",

    "the deformation of the action corresponding to ( [ vbeta ] ) follows from the standard descent procedure .",
