    "colliding bubbles in a first - order phase transition constitute one possible source of stochastic gravitational wave ( gw ) radiation  @xcite .",
    "if the electroweak phase transition is strongly first - order , for instance , the kinetic energy stored in the higgs field and the bulk motion of the plasma is partially released into gravity waves .",
    "this happens mostly at the end of the phase transition , when collisions break the spherical symmetry of the individual higgs field bubbles .",
    "this possibility was systematically analyzed in a series of papers  @xcite .",
    "the first simulation  @xcite consisted hereby of the full scalar field dynamics of two bubbles in vacuum , where the essential observation was made that the emitted radiation depends only on the gross features of the problem , namely the kinetic energy stored in the uncollided bubble regions .",
    "this observation is the basis of the so - called envelope approximation that opened up the possibility of simulating phase transitions with a large number of bubbles .",
    "this was subsequently exploited in refs .",
    "@xcite and further refined for a thermal environment in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the case of only two colliding bubbles ,",
    "the spectrum decreases as @xmath2 for high frequencies .",
    "but this result might be special to the case of two bubbles , where the collision never finishes , which makes the introduction of a time cutoff function mandatory  @xcite .",
    "the situation is different if a realistic phase transition with a large number of bubbles is simulated .",
    "there were hints in refs .",
    "@xcite that the spectrum of multi - bubble simulations might be more flat than in the two bubble case , but the numerical accuracy prohibited a conclusive statement . as a result ,",
    "the frequency fall - off of the two bubble case is still being used in the present day literature  @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present work is to reexamine the generated spectrum of gws by simulating a phase transition with a large number of bubbles , making use of the aforementioned envelope approximation .",
    "compared to ref .",
    "@xcite , the numerical accuracy will be considerably improved , and a larger portion of the spectrum will be determined to allow for a careful analysis of the high frequency behavior .",
    "the fundamental quantity that enters the determination of the gravitational radiation are the spatial components of the stress - energy tensor @xmath3 . for a thermal phase transition it consists of the scalar field part and the plasma contribution . the total energy radiated into a direction @xmath4",
    "is then given by  @xcite [ eq_weinberg ] = 2 g ^2 _ ij , lm ( ) t^*_ij ( , ) t_lm ( , ) , where @xmath5 denotes the stress - energy tensor in fourier space [ eq_tij_fourier ] t_ij ( , ) = dt e^it d^3x e^- i t_ij ( * x * , t ) , and @xmath6 is the projection tensor for the transverse - traceless part _",

    "the key idea of the envelope approximation  @xcite is that the gw production does not depend on the details of the evolution of the scalar field in the region of the collided bubbles , but rather on the gross features of the problem , namely the shape of the uncollided bubble walls .",

    "@xmath14 determines how much of the vacuum energy is transformed into kinetic energy of the bulk fluid instead of reheating the plasma inside the bubble .",
    "this coefficient can be determined as a function of the parameter @xmath15 that is defined as the ratio between the vacuum energy and the total energy stored in radiation  @xcite ( ) = , = .",
    "the last ingredient from the phase transition is the velocity of the bubble wall @xmath16 .",

    "it turns out that this substitution in the case of two bubbles overestimates the resulting gw production by more than one order of magnitude ; additionally , the peak frequency is shifted to larger values what was first noticed in the simulation of the scalar field evolution of two single bubbles in ref .",
    "this result is rather surprising , since _",
    "e.g. _ in electrodynamics with a localized source , the quadrupole approximation generally underestimates the full result .",
    "however , in the present case the assumption of localized sources is not applicable such that the quadrupole approximation can overestimate the full result as detailed in ref .",

    "the parameter @xmath18 is approximately the duration of the phase transition .",
    "since @xmath19 is the sole dimensionful parameter of the phase transition , the fraction of energy liberated into gravitational wave radiation per frequency octave is  @xcite _ gw * = = ^2 ( ) ^2 ( ) ^2 ( / , v_b ) , where we used the definition of the hubble constant h^2 = = , and defined the dimensionless function @xmath20 as ( / , v_b ) = d _ ij ,",

    "to calculate the function @xmath24 , we proceed as follows .",
    "first , we choose the main parameters of the simulation : the radius of the part of the universe under consideration @xmath25 , and the number of directions to integrate over , @xmath26 .",
    "since the gw production is isotropic , the directional variation indicates the statistical uncertainty of the simulation .    using this information",
    ", we simulate a scenario with random nucleation times and locations for the bubbles following the nucleation probability in eq .",
    "( [ nuc_prob ] ) . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , our volume is spherical and the bubbles are cut off by the boundary which is equivalent to having a mirror symmetric configuration beyond the volume .",
    "the result for a small and a large universe and a few directions , @xmath27 , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_comp ] . for large wall velocities ,",
    "the size of the simulated part of the universe mostly influences the total amplitude of the gw radiation .",
    "however , for smaller wall velocities , the produced radiation at high frequencies depends crucially on the size of the universe . for small velocities",
    "the high frequency part of the spectrum approaches the quadrupole approximation , since in this case @xmath28 .",
    "this is not identical to the quadrupole approximation ( only the phase in eq .",
    "( [ eq_aij ] ) vanishes ) , but it turns out that the additional phase in eq .",
    "( [ eq_cij ] ) from the bubble position solely leads to a slight suppression of the low frequency part of the spectrum in our numerical results .",
    "the enhancement of the high - frequency part in the quadrupole approximation can be explained in the following way .",
    "after the nucleation of the first bubble , the phase transition ends when the whole space is in the new phase , which typically takes a time @xmath29 .",
    "however , if the radius of the simulated volume @xmath25 is chosen too small , the simulation ends when the first nucleated bubble covers the whole spherical volume .",
    "this leads to a suppression of the total gw density and also to a rather steep edge in the time profile that amplifies the high frequency part of the spectrum .",
    "this enhancement effect is non - physical and just arises because of the finite size of our test volume and the presence of the boundary .",
    "it disappears for larger volumes , when the phase transition is finished before the first nucleated bubble covers the whole spherical volume and boundary effects are small . for large bubble velocities ,",
    "when the quadrupole approximation does not apply , the enhancement also disappears , since effects from large bubbles are in general reduced due to the fast oscillation of the integrand in eq .",

    "[ fig_comp ] result from the integration over the @xmath27 different directions .",
    "if the number of directions would be further increased , most of the displayed oscillatory features in the spectrum would persist , since they result from the finiteness of the size of the simulation @xmath25 and depend on the specific nucleation positions and times of the randomly generated scenario .",
    "in addition , the amplitude of the low frequency part of the spectrum and the total emitted radiation depend sensitively on the times of the first bubble nucleation and first collision , which are however quite similar in the different scenarios . to decrease these features",
    ", one has to further increase the size of the universe and/or average over several scenarios .",
    "we will do the latter in the following .    our final results , shown in fig .",

    "the given error bars result from this averaging procedure .",

    "this is reflected by the numerical results . for large frequencies , we find that @xmath31 scales as @xmath34 , unlike the two - bubbles case that was discussed in ref .  @xcite .",
    "we parametrize the spectrum as [ res1 ] _ gw*(f _ * ) = _ gw * , with the peak frequency @xmath35 and the peak amplitude @xmath36 and both parameters are functions of the wall velocity .",

    "note that the fit is optimized for a frequency range close to the peak frequency , and does not correctly reproduce the asymptotic low frequency behavior .",
    "cm    the main result of our analysis is that the spectrum scales for high frequencies close to @xmath34 in contrast to the two bubble case presented in ref .  @xcite .",
    "this feature is already present for a rather small volume ( just a few bubbles ) and high wall velocities ( @xmath42 ) as depicted in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_comp ] .",

    "this result is especially interesting in the light of recent investigations  @xcite that indicate that in the case of a first - order electroweak phase transition ( obtained by a singlet sector  @xcite or higher dimensional operators  @xcite ) the peak frequency of the produced radiation is below the best sensitivity range of planed satellite experiments , such as lisa and bbo  @xcite .",

    "<S> we reexamine the production of gravitational waves by bubble collisions during a first - order phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum of the gravitational radiation is determined by numerical simulations using the `` envelope approximation '' . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the spectrum rises as @xmath0 for small frequencies and decreases as @xmath1 for high frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the fall - off at high frequencies is significantly slower than previously stated in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> this result has direct impact on detection prospects for gravity waves originating from a strong first - order electroweak phase transition at space - based interferometers , such as lisa or bbo . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we observe a slight dependence of the peak frequency on the bubble wall velocity . </S>"
