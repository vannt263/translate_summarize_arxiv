    "as by far the nearest supernova to be observed in the modern era , sn 1987a offered a unique opportunity to search for a pulsar at the very beginning of its life .",
    "the detection of a neutrino burst at the time of the sn @xcite was good evidence that a neutron star was formed at the time of the explosion .",
    "if such a pulsar were found , it would of course be of immense interest to study its properties at such an early stage of its life .",
    "the crab pulsar remains the youngest known radio pulsar , with a characteristic age , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the first time derivative of the period , of 1240 years and a true age of about 950 years .",
    "three apparently younger pulsars are known , all detected only at x - ray or @xmath3-ray wavelengths : psrs j1808@xmath42024 , j1846@xmath40258 and j1907 + 0919 .",
    "the first and third are `` soft gamma - ray repeaters '' , with long periods but very large spin - down rates , giving them characteristic ages of just 280 years and 1050 years respectively .",
    "psr j1846@xmath40258 is an x - ray pulsar lying at the center of the supernova remnant ( snr ) kes 75 with a characteristic age of about 720 years .",
    "[ fg : ppdot ] shows the observed distribution of pulsars in the @xmath5 plane .",
    "anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) and sgrs are located in the top - right corner of the diagram with strong implied surface dipole magnetic fields , @xmath6 , and long periods .",
    "there are about 35 plausible , or at least possible , associations of pulsars with supernova remnants and these are all relatively young pulsars , mostly with @xmath7 years .",
    "non - thermal pulsations in the optical , x - ray or @xmath3-ray bands are observed from about 45 pulsars and , apart from a few millisecond pulsars , these pulsars are relatively young .",
    "of the 35 pulsars in the catalogue with characteristic age less than 20,000 years , 21 are detected in one or more of the high - energy bands .",
    "only four or five pulsars have detectable non - thermal pulsations at optical wavelengths @xcite , but these include two of the youngest known pulsars , the crab pulsar and psr b0540@xmath469 .",
    "furthermore , psr b0540@xmath469 is located in the large magellanic cloud , not far from sn 1987a .",
    "one other young pulsar , psr j0537@xmath46910 , which has a period of just 16 ms , is also located in the large magellanic cloud close to sn 1987a .",
    "this pulsar is detected only at x - ray wavelengths and is associated with the snr n157b .",
    "the way pulsars move on the @xmath5 diagram is determined by the time - dependence of the rotational braking torque . for many possible braking mechanisms , the torque can be expressed as a power law @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a constant , @xmath10 and @xmath11 is known as the braking index . for braking by reaction to emission of magnetic - dipole radiation , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the dipole magnetic field strength at the surface of the neutron star , and @xmath14 .",
    "the observed value of @xmath11 is dominated by the secular braking in only the youngest known pulsars and values of @xmath11 between 1.4 and 3.0 have been measured .",
    "if the true age of pulsar , @xmath15 , is known or can be estimated , for example , from an association with a snr , and the braking index @xmath11 is assumed to be constant , the pulse period at birth can be estimated from @xmath16^{1/(n-1)}\\ ] ] where p is the current period .",
    "there are 12 snr ",
    "pulsar associations where a reasonably reliable snr age can be estimated @xcite leading to estimates of birth period which range from @xmath17  ms for psr j0538@xmath46910 to about 420  ms for psr j1210 - 5226 , associated with the large shell snr g296.5 + 10.0 . for the crab pulsar ,",
    "the estimated birth period is about 19 ms .    a statistical study of the pulsars detected in the parkes multibeam pulsar survey ( pmps ) @xcite taking into account the survey selection effects @xcite suggests that 40% of pulsars are born with periods in the range 100  500 ms . from an analysis of pulsars detected in the pmps and the swinburne intermediate - latitude pulsar survey ,",
    "@xcite obtained consistent results with a gaussian initial - period distribution centred at 300  ms and with a standard deviation of 150  ms .",
    "the distribution of initial magnetic magnetic fields is not well known .",
    "@xcite find that pulsars with @xmath18  g account for more than half the pulsar birthrate and an independent analysis by @xcite confirms these results .",
    "on the other hand , fig .",
    "[ fg : ppdot ] shows many pulsars exist with periods of a few hundred milliseconds and @xmath13 in the range @xmath19 to @xmath20  g. these pulsars have very probably been born close to their present location in the @xmath21 plane .",
    "although their observed number is comparable to the number of high-@xmath13 pulsars , their birthrate is much lower because they move across the @xmath21 plane much more slowly .",
    "early searches concentrated on optical wavelengths because x - ray telescopes had insufficient senstivity and the expectation that the surrounding nebula would be opaque at radio wavelengths .",
    "the first australian attempt was made by bruce peterson and the author on 26 february , 1987 , just three days after the sn , using the 4-m anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) with the dust cover nearly closed and a high - speed photometer system previously used for pulsar timing @xcite . in the next few months , several observations were made using an 8-inch celestron telescope on the ground beside the aat with the photometer system and then through 1988 at approximately monthly intervals , again using the aat .",
    "these searches gave a limit on the pulsed fraction of the sn light of about @xmath22 corresponding to an i - magnitude limit of about 20 @xcite .",
    "a similar search was carried out at las campanas , cerro tololo and mt stromlo observatories by @xcite with a similar upper limit on any optical pulsations .    then in march , 1989 , @xcite announced the detection of a periodicity at 0.508  ms based on a 7-hour observation with the 4-m cerro tololo telescope .",
    "the periodicity had a sinusoidal variation with a period of about 8 hours , suggesting the presence of a jupiter - sized planet around the pulsar .",
    "the very short pulse period had major implications for neutron - star models and more than 50 papers were published in the next year or so on the implications of this result .",
    "regretably , in 1990 , it was realised that the periodicity was spurious , due to interference from the tv guider on the telescope @xcite .",
    "a brazilian group claimed detection of optical pulsations at 18.4  ms ( reported by @xcite ) but this was not confirmed @xcite .",
    "an extensive search using various eso telescopes between 1988 march and 1990 april was reported by @xcite with limits of about 22nd magnitude for pulsations at frequencies up to 5000 hz .    in 1992",
    "john middledditch began circulating a series of preprints of an extensive paper , ultimately published in 2000 @xcite , reporting the detection of optical pulsations at a period of 2.14  ms using the las campanas 2.5-m dupont telescope and other telescopes .",
    "although there were numerous detections of a signal near this period , the significance of each was relatively low and the period and amplitude showed significant and largely unpredictable fluctuations . in particular , a modulation of the signal with a period of @xmath23  s was observed .",
    "this modulation was of uncertain origin , sometimes having the appearance of amplitude modulation and sometimes frequency or phase modulation .",
    "[ fg : mkk_freq ] shows the observed variations in amplitude of the signal , its fundamental frequency and the frequency of the modulation .",
    "the amplitude of the pulsed signal was highly variable with i magnitudes in the range 21 to 25 and a persistent spin - down with @xmath24  s@xmath25 was observed .",
    "@xcite suggested that the observations were consistent with precession and spin - down due to gravitational radiation from a neutron star with a non - axisymmetric oblateness of @xmath26 . despite repeated observations by @xcite and others , no evidence for this pulsation",
    "was found after 1996 and its identification with a neutron star in sn 1987a remains doubtful .",
    "an optical search using the high speed photometer system on the _ hubble space telescope _ was reported by @xcite .",
    "four observations in 1992  1993 covering the band 160  700 nm , each of about 40  min duration and with 100 @xmath27s sampling , were searched with both fourier and time - domain folding methods .",
    "no significant pulsations were observed in the period range 0.2  ms to 10  s with an upper limit for the pulsed emission equivalent to a v magnitude of @xmath28 .",
    "a search with similar parameters was made by @xcite using the 3.9-m anglo - australian telescope .",
    "data were obtained on two nights of exceptional seeing and searched for periodicities in the range 0.2  ms to 10  s. no signficant pulsations were observed with an upper limit in v of about 24.6 magnitudes .",
    "most pulsars are detected at radio wavelengths and so , despite the low probability of a detection at least in the first few years , searching for a pulsar in sn 1987a at radio wavelengths was an obvious thing to do .",
    "early searches using the parkes 64-m radio telescope at frequencies between 400 and 5000 mhz were reported by @xcite with the best upper limit @xmath29  mjy at 1.5 ghz .",
    "observations have been made every 1  2 years since then with similar parameters and upper limits .",
    "a more extensive search was carried out at parkes in 2006 december 19  23 using three different receivers and different filterbank systems .",
    "the frequencies and bandwidths used are listed in table  [ tb : radio_limits ] . for all observations",
    "the sum of the power in the two orthogonal polarisations for each frequency channel was one - bit sampled and recorded on digital linear tapes ; see @xcite for details of the data acquisition and recording system .",

    "from dm@xmath30 to 3  dm@xmath32 the trial dms are separated by 2  dm@xmath31 and so on until the maximum dm is reached .",
    "data were processed using the sigproc pulsar search package .",
    "data were first dedispersed at each trial dm and then compensated for the doppler shifts resulting from motion of the observatory relative to the solar - system barycenter .",
    "the resulting time series was then fourier - transformed , harmonics summed and the power spectra searched for candidates above a threshold of @xmath33 .",
    "dm ranges searched and observation times on sn 1987a are given in table  [ tb : radio_limits ] .",
    "transform lengths were @xmath34 samples and the pulse period range searched was between the inverse nyquist frequency and 5  s. observations of 2.3-h duration were also made with each system at a position 30 arcmin south of the sn position to assist with identifying spurious candidates .",
    "no significant candidates with a s / n ratio greater than 9.0 were observed in any system and in no case was there a convincing detection of a genuine candidate in more than one receiver system or in independent observations with the same system .",
    "the flux density limits corresponding to a @xmath35 threshold in each analysis are given in table  [ tb : radio_limits ] . in deriving these limits ,",
    "the pulse duty cycle was assumed to be 0.1 .",
    "many young pulsars drive a pulsar - wind nebula ( pwn ) .",
    "the most famous example is of course the crab nebula , but it is far from being typical . even of the known pulsars associated with snr , only about half have detectable pwn @xcite . with just a few exceptions ,",
    "all of the pulsars with associated pwn have spin - down luminosities greater than @xmath36   erg  s@xmath37 .",
    "only a minority of snr have detectable pwn .",
    "for example , the cambridge snr catalogue @xcite contains 265 snr of which only 39 have evidence for a pwn .",
    "clearly , detectable pwn are only associated with the most energetic young pulsars .",
    "compact central objects ( cco ) have been found in eight or nine snr @xcite .",
    "these objects have thermal x - ray spectra consistent with surface emission from a neutron star .",
    "@xcite searched for ccos in a volume - limited sample of snrs , placing luminosity limits of @xmath38  erg  s@xmath37 on x - ray point sources in four snrs .",
    "limits an order of magnitude higher are placed on a further six snr from the sample by @xcite .",
    "these limits are comparable to the lowest detected luminosities from ccos , for example , rx j0007.0 + 7302 in w44 , which has a luminosity of @xmath39  erg  s@xmath37 @xcite . hence they do not necessarily rule out the presence of a central neutron star in these snr .",
    "although sn 1987a , or more accurately , the resulting snr , is getting brighter at all wavelengths , imaging observations show that the increasing emission is confined to the outer parts of the expanding envelope and , at least in the optical and x - ray bands , primarily to the region of interaction with the inner ring @xcite .",
    "there is no evidence for a central point ( or near - point ) source at any wavelength .",
    "@xcite obtain a luminosity limit in the 2  10 kev band of @xmath40  erg  s@xmath37 using _ xmm - newton _ data and @xcite obtain a limit of @xmath41  erg  s@xmath37 using _",
    "chandra_. in the optical band from 290 to 965 nm @xcite give a limit on the luminosity of any point source of @xmath42  erg  s@xmath37 using the _ hubble space telescope_.    these limits are well above luminosities of detected cco in our galaxy and hence do not preclude the presence of a similar object in sn 1987a . based on a bolometric luminosity limit of @xmath43  erg  s@xmath37 for a central pwn , @xcite find that for a pulsar period of 300  ms , @xmath44  g , not a very restrictive limit .    at radio wavelengths ,",
    "the best limit is obtained from the 9-ghz imaging where the expanding shell is best resolved @xcite . however , even at this frequency , the beamwidth is a signficant fraction of the nebular diameter and it is difficult to limit the flux density of any central pwn or pulsar .",
    "a conservative limit on the flux density of a central source is 1 mjy . if we assume a flat radio spectrum and a radio bandwidth of 20 ghz , then this corresponds to a radio luminosity of @xmath45  erg  s@xmath37 .",
    "let us assume that the entire spin - down energy of a central pulsar is converted to luminosity of a surrounding pwn .",
    "this is the most conservative assumption in the sense of giving a lower limit to spin - down luminosity of any central pulsar .",
    "if we assume a spin period of 200  ms , then for a spin - down luminosity of @xmath46  erg  s@xmath37 , the required surface dipole magnetic field is @xmath47  g. as discussed above , these parameters are within the range of possible birth parameters for pulsars .",
    "if we make the more realistic assumption that only a fraction of the spin - down luminosity goes to powering a pwn , then the pulsar period could be shorter and/or the magnetic field stronger .",
    "it is abundantly clear that a central neutron star , if it exists , does not have the high spin - down luminosity typical of pulsars associated with galactic pwn .",
    "however , it is also true that existing limits on the luminosity of a central point source do not rule out the presence of a perfectly plausible young neutron star with @xmath0  ms and @xmath13 in the range @xmath19 to @xmath20  g at the centre of sn 1987a .",
    "since the optical non - thermal emission from pulsars is evidently a strong function of pulsar period @xcite , optical searches are doomed to failure if the central pulsar has a period of 100  ms or more as suggested above .",
    "the flux density limits given in table  [ tb : radio_limits ] correspond to a radio luminosity ( assuming an effective radiated bandwidth of 1 ghz and a circular beam of width @xmath48 ) of about @xmath49  erg  s@xmath37 , much less than the likely spin - down luminosity for a central pulsar . for a more direct comparison with the radio luminosity of known pulsars , we use the psuedo - luminosity @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the mean flux density at 1400 mhz and @xmath52 is the pulsar distance . for @xmath53jy ,",
    "the upper limit on @xmath54 is about 125  mjy  kpc@xmath55 .",
    "[ fg : rlum ] shows @xmath54 versus age for known radio pulsars with this limit marked by a horizontal dashed line . because of the ( relatively ) large distance to the magellanic clouds , the limit is not very restrictive .",
    "even the crab pulsar is below the line and young but low - luminosity pulsars found in deep searches toward snr such as j1124 - 5916 in g292.0 + 1.8 @xcite and j1930 + 1852 in g54.1 + 0.3 @xcite , both of which have @xmath56 yrs and @xmath57  mjy kpc@xmath55 , are nearly two orders of magnitude below it .",
    "therefore , these radio searches certainly do not exclude the presence of a low - luminosity pulsar similar to many young pulsars in our galaxy at the centre of sn 1987a .     where @xmath51 is the mean flux density at 1400 mhz and @xmath52 is the pulsar distance ) as a function of characteristic age .",
    "the upper limit for a pulsar in sn 1987a is shown by the horizontal dashed line and the crab pulsar is marked by a star .",
    ", width=302 ]    even if a pulsar with a high radio luminosity were present in sn 1987a , there are a number of reasons why we might not be able to detect it .",
    "most obviously , the pulsar may not be beamed toward us .",
    "the beaming fraction ( fraction of the celestial sphere swept over by the beam as the star rotates ) is not very well determined .",
    "beaming fractions are probably larger in the high - energy bands where the emission is incoherent and could be 50% or more . in the radio band , a beaming fraction of 20% is often assumed , but for young pulsars it could be considerably larger .",
    "radio beams are generally quite patchy , so even if the over - all beamwidth is large , there is a finite chance of being missed by the stronger parts of the beam .",
    "it is possible that the pulsar magnetic field takes some time to develop .",
    "most current models assume either that the field a compressed stellar field or that it is generated during the collapse by dynamo action ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but other models exist @xcite in which the field growth takes place after the neutron - star formation .",
    "if the growth timescale is decades , then even a rapidly spinning neutron star could still be undetectable .    even though the outer parts of the sn 1987a nebula are now quite transparent in all relevant bands , it is possible that the immediate environment of the central star still has a relatively high gas density which would cause scattering and/or absorption of emission from the star .",
    "@xcite discuss fallback of stellar ejecta on to the neutron star and show that it will have a very high opacity at early times and will be largely driven off by radiation pressure . however ,",
    "fallback is possible decades after the sn explosion @xcite and this may still form a relatively dense and turbulent nebula surrounding the star .",
    "finally , there is the possibility that a neutron star formed at the time of the sn accreted so much matter from fallback of ejecta that it exceeded the maximum mass of a neutron star and became a black hole @xcite .",
    "@xcite argue that this is unlikely , or at least subject to a restrictive range of conditions .",
    "the enormously exciting prospect of being able to study a pulsar in its earliest years has motivated a large number of searches for a pulsar in sn 1987a .",
    "these searches were primarily at optical and radio wavelengths since our experience with other young pulsars shows that these are the most likely bands for a successful detection .",
    "regretably , despite all this effort ( and several false alarms ) no pulsar has been detected .",
    "furthermore , limits on the luminosity of a central point ( or near point ) source at the centre of sn 1987a show that any central pulsar is not highly energetic like the crab pulsar or psr b0540@xmath469 .",
    "however , all of these limits leave open a region of parameter space for a young neutron star in the centre of sn 1987a .",
    "specifically , a neutron star with a rotation period @xmath0  ms and a surface dipole magnetic field strength @xmath13 in the range @xmath19 to @xmath20  g is not ruled out by any observations so far .",
    "there is clear evidence that some neutron stars are born in the galaxy with parameters in this range",
    ".    therefore , continued searches for a pulsar in sn 1987a are certainly justified .",
    "the greatly increased sensitivity of the proposed square kilometer array will be highly beneficial to radio searches since the current luminosity limits are well above typical luminosities of young radio pulsars .",
    "if the pulse period is relatively long , detection of non - thermal optical or x - ray pulsations is unlikely , but more senstive searches in the future may detect thermal emission from the neutron - star surface and possibly modulation due to rotation of the star .",
