    "<S> bulk charge density modulations , recently observed in high critical - temperature ( @xmath0 ) cuprate superconductors , coexist with the so - called pseudogap and compete with superconductivity . however , its direct observation has been limited to a narrow doping region in the underdoped regime . using energy - resolved resonant x - ray scattering </S>",
    "<S> we have found evidence for such bulk charge modulations , or soft collective charge modes ( soft ccms ) , in optimally doped bi@xmath1pb@xmath2sr@xmath3cacu@xmath4o@xmath5 ( pb - bi2212 ) around the summit of the superconducting dome with momentum transfer @xmath6 reciprocal lattice units ( r.l.u . ) along the cu - o bond direction . the signal is stronger at @xmath7 than at lower temperatures , thereby confirming a competition between soft ccms and superconductivity . </S>",
    "<S> these results demonstrate that soft ccms are not constrained to the underdoped regime , suggesting that soft ccms appear across a large part of the phase diagram of cuprates and are intimately entangled with high-@xmath0 superconductivity .    </S>",
    "<S> a much studied property of high critical - temperature ( @xmath0 ) cuprate superconductors is the opening , below the temperature @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) , of the so - called _ pseudogap _ @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recent experiments have suggested that the pseudogap is accompanied by a special broken electronic symmetry , often indicated as a modulation of the charge density residing in the cuo@xmath10 planes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these charge modulations can be seen as soft charge collective modes ( soft ccms ) , comprising both static charge density waves with no energy loss , and dynamical charge modes having finite mass . </S>",
    "<S> if the pseudogap was connected to a broken translational symmetry , the soft ccms would be truly static . </S>",
    "<S> soft ccms in bulk states have been observed only in a narrow interval of the underdoped regime , there establishing a clear link with the @xmath0 suppression around 1/8 doping ( `` the 1/8 anomaly '' ) . on the other hand , causality links with the opening of the pseudogap </S>",
    "<S> still need to be demonstrated . </S>",
    "<S> how soft ccms shape the fermi surface and how strongly they couple to the phonon dispersion is still actively studied . </S>",
    "<S> further , knowing their doping dependence and how they evolve from static charge order to dynamical charge modes may provide crucial insights about their role in high-@xmath0 superconductivity and about the quantum critical point in the cuprate phase diagram .    </S>",
    "<S> evidence for soft ccms in the bulk states around @xmath11 hole doping was provided first indirectly by inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) , as a magnetic incommensurate peak near the antiferromagnetic points @xmath12 and @xmath13 in la@xmath14nd@xmath15sr@xmath16cuo@xmath17 ( lnsco ) and la@xmath18ba@xmath16cuo@xmath17 ( lbco ) @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> these charge modulations have been observed in a wide doping range , but questions arise about the correspondence of bulk electronic states with those studied at the surface of samples .    in this rapid communication , we have studied optimally doped bi@xmath1pb@xmath2sr@xmath3cacu@xmath4o@xmath5 ( pb - bi2212 ) by high resolution resonant inelastic x - ray scattering ( rixs ) , focusing on the quasi - elastic spectral component that is sensitive to charge modulations @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the direct observation of soft ccms in an optimally doped compound significantly expands the doping range where superconductivity , the pseudogap , and the tendency towards charge ordering coexist , hinting at the universality of soft ccms in the cuprate superconductors and thus stimulating different hypotheses about their role in superconductivity itself .    </S>",

    "<S> is multiplied by a factor of 1.25 .    </S>",
    "<S> the peak of the quasi - elastic signal at @xmath30 r.l.u . suggests the existence of soft ccms with a periodicity of @xmath71 lattice units in the bulk state of optimally doped bi2212 . </S>",
    "<S> the result is very similar to previous scattering reports from underdoped samples . </S>",
    "<S> the only previous observation of soft ccms in an optimally doped sample is on lbco , which however undergoes a structural transition not present for other cuprates . </S>",
    "<S> there the stabilization of static charge order is abrupt across the orthorhombic - tetragonal transition at 56 k @xcite , although the soft ccm signal was detected with rixs up to 85 k @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , these previous results ( see table i ) can not conclusively establish whether soft ccms exist in a wider doping range including optimal doping ( @xmath3216@xmath72 ) .    on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> a short range checkerboard or stripe - like order over a wide doping range has been reported by stm @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the characteristic wave vector is @xmath19 r.l.u . along the cu - o bond direction @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> further , the dispersion in the pseudogap state , determined by arpes , is consistent with short correlation - length charge modulations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , stm and arpes are surface sensitive probes , and can not confirm the bulk electronic states . </S>",
    "<S> our rixs results on bi2212 demonstrate that bulk charge modulations exist at least up to optimal doping , suggesting that the soft ccms are universal in the pseudogap regime of the cuprates . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , the observed characteristic wave vector of @xmath19 and the short correlation length are , though not identical , consistent between the bulk and surface sensitive studies .    the drastic decrease of the @xmath73 r.l.u . </S>",
    "<S> peak below @xmath0 [ fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(b ) ] shows that soft ccms are suppressed by superconductivity and compete with it , in analogy to what has been observed in ybco , where the soft ccm peak weakens and broadens below @xmath0 , but is restored by an external magnetic field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we note that at @xmath0 the soft ccm peak is broader in bi2212 than in ybco , and that the incommensurate wave vector is slightly different . from the data of table </S>",
    "<S> i we see that the soft ccm wave - vector spans the 0.24 - 0.31 r.l.u . </S>",
    "<S> range in various materials , and the peak intensity and width are influenced by compositional disorder . </S>",
    "<S> it is also noteworthy that arpes has suggested a competition between the pseudogap and superconducting order parameters in bi2212 @xcite , establishing an important connection to the competition between soft ccms and superconducting order parameters seen here . </S>",
    "<S> further , such a phase competition could results in the recently proposed phase diagram @xcite where the phase boundary for the competing order bends back in the superconducting dome .    </S>",
    "<S> .comparison of charge modulations in different cuprate compounds measured with soft x - ray scattering . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath74 is the correlation length as deduced from the full width as half maximum @xmath75 of the scattering peak , @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     charge modulations are often driven by fermi surface nesting , as it has been discussed also for the cuprates . however , the fermi surface shape of optimally doped bi2212 determined by arpes @xcite suggests that the soft ccm wave - vector is longer than the distance between the fermi momenta at the brillouin zone boundary ( antinodes ) , so that soft ccms can not be driven by the fermi surface nesting between the antinodes . </S>",
    "<S> this is also in agreement with the non - trivial doping- and material - dependence of @xmath50 ( table i ) and the results of ref . . </S>",
    "<S> the diversity of @xmath50 and the effects of magnetic fields @xcite call for further studies .    </S>",
    "<S> although soft ccms are not related with an obvious fermi surface nesting vector and can not thus directly explain the opening of the peudogap in that region of the @xmath77-space , a link between the two phenomena is likely to exist up to optimal doping and possibly even in the overdoped regime . </S>",
    "<S> these facts suggest that an incipient charge density instability is inherent to the pseudogap regime . </S>",
    "<S> although our result can not conclude whether the soft ccms are fluctuating or static , the short correlation length in the optimally doped sample could be due to an increasingly dynamical behavior of charge modes with the doping level . </S>",
    "<S> the observation of the soft ccm peak gaining mass , decreasing in intensity , and increasing in width as the phase boundary is crossed would be compelling evidence for an underlying quantum critical point and the competition with superconductivity , and awaits further study with more sensitive and selective x - ray probes in the future . </S>"
