    "the study of heavy ion collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) has brought about very strong evidence for the creation of a very high energy density , low baryon chemical potential , medium which can not simply be described in terms of hadrons  @xcite .",
    "prominent demonstrations of this new medium created are : parton energy loss , evidence for very rapid thermalization of the hot plasma created in collisions from the measurement of azimuthal flow , and abundant production of baryons compared to the case of the some yields observed in proton proton collisions . the first effect we mention _ i.e. _ the parton energy loss in the hot plasma results in a suppression of the yield of high pt ( @xmath3 gev / c ) mesons by a factor of @xmath4 5 compared to the one measured in pp collisions .",
    "this is quantified by the parameter @xmath5 given by    @xmath6    and/or the measurement of the disappearance of `` away side '' jets .",
    "@xmath7 is the overlap function between the two nucleons , as function of the impact parameter , @xmath8 .",
    "the measurement of the same ratio for baryons ( @xmath9 , @xmath10,@xmath11 and @xmath12 ) have brought a surprise : the value of @xmath5 was completely different from the one observed for pions indicating a much lesser apparent suppression or , what is more probable , an increase in the baryon production in the range where the excess is observed .",
    "this effect was not predicted by theory contrary to the parton energy loss and the azimuthal flow , and up to date does not have a completely satisfactory explanation .",
    "this somewhat anomalous behavior of the baryon production is called the baryon puzzle and refers to the @xmath13 and @xmath14 ratios measured in the heavy ion collisions and even in pp collisions .",
    "the studies of particle production as a function of @xmath15 , in the momentum regions where identification is possible at rhic , exhibit the following behavior : the @xmath13 and @xmath16 ratios increase with @xmath15 up to @xmath4 2 gev/@xmath17 and then start to decrease for higher @xmath15 in both @xmath1  @xcite and @xmath2  @xcite collisions , reaching a value which corresponds to the fragmentation value observed in @xmath18 collisions for quarks and gluons  @xcite .",
    "+ the spectra at @xmath19 gev/@xmath17 have been observed to follow a @xmath20  @xcite and @xmath21  @xcite scaling , consistent with a transition between soft and hard processes at around @xmath22 gev/@xmath17 .",
    "the surprise lies in the fact that one would expect a ratio that does not exceed the fragmentation value _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath23 as observed in @xmath24 collisions , while in the experiment the ratio rises up to more than one ! + in the literature two possible explanation are prominently put forward :    * the hydrodynamical approach  @xcite where one assumes a local thermal equilibrium of partonic / hadronic matter at an initial time , describing the space - time evolution of thermalized matter by solving the equations for energy - momentum conservation in the hydro picture .",
    "another model , where the radial flow and the size of the system of emitting particles are taking into account  @xcite , can describe the proton to pion ratio for different centralities .",
    "+ the hydrodynamical picture has been used to explain the broad features of the increase in the baryon / meson ratio with limited success by kolb and heinz  @xcite . * a large class of models called generically `` coalescence '' where the particle species ratios observed in the intermediate @xmath25 regime ( 2 - 6 gev / c ) of heavy ion collisions are explained by a collective production mechanism , namely recombination or coalescence  @xcite . in most coalescence models hadrons are assumed to form from essentially collinear partons .",
    "the parton overlap function is sometimes simply assumed to be a delta function , or at best in some cases small finite transverse widths have been used , assuming an @xmath21 distribution like one expects to see in the final state hadron , such that the partons do not have to undergo a change in momentum when forming a hadron .",
    "although the coalescence models have been accepted , they do not provide a satisfactory response to many questions  @xcite .",
    "furthermore in our opinion there also is a fundamental contradiction between the fitting of the spectra with the coalescence approach which involves also some flow contribution and the thermal analysis where , by a simultaneous fit to the slopes of pions , kaons and protons one extracts the temperature and the corresponding flow  @xcite .",
    "since the coalescence approach * does change * the proton slope with respect to the one of the mesons even in absence of flow , the temperature  flow analysis should be reconsidered if the coalescence model is to be accepted .",
    "recently , experimental data measured at two different energies also indicate that the trend of the coalescence models do no fit the data @xcite + it is a fact that none of the models have been tested in a wide centrality and energy range or with different projectiles , so that the success of this approach should be questioned .",
    "+ we present a toy model that illustrates the possibility to reproduce the observed ratios for @xmath13 using a model to incorporate the flow in the existing event generators .",
    "the aim is to demonstrate that the radial flow , as claimed in hydro calculations , does have a considerable influence on @xmath13 ratios in a wide range of centralities starting from @xmath1 collisions .",
    "one might ask why are we including the proton collisions in these considerations - knowing that it is difficult to expect flow in so light a colliding system .",
    "we include the pp collisions because in the conventional radial flow analysis of star  @xcite , making a simultaneous fit to the slopes of pion , kaon and proton spectra an `` _ equivalent flow _ '' of @xmath4 0.2c is found .",
    "the measured value is of course much smaller than the one obtained in the most central @xmath2 collisions where the value of flow reaches @xmath26 .",
    "+ the remainder of this work is organized as follows : in section 2 , we give a brief description of the event generators , the section 3 describes our toy model of flow used to describe experimental data . in section 4 ,",
    "the results of our model and their comparison to experimental @xmath2 and @xmath27 results are presented .",
    "finally some conclusion are drawn in section 5 .",
    "the main tool of comparison of the measured with the existing knowledge is compiled in the so called event generators . among them",
    "the most prominent is the pythia@xcite generator for the proton - proton collisions and the hijing  @xcite generator for the heavy ion collisions . we should mention that even proton - proton collision can be studied using hijing .",
    "the version 6.2 of pythia , does not reproduce the proton to pion ratio  @xcite with its default parameters .",
    "the possibility to improve the situation by including the leading order(lo ) and next to leading order ( nlo ) corrections which are implemented in pythia by the so called k - factor , has been explored .",
    "the requirement of a k - factor may indicate collective phenomena in @xmath1 collisions as in heavy ions data  @xcite .",
    "the k - factor as function of the energy has been extracted  @xcite together with other phenomena as energy loss for hard partons and temperature effects to explain the @xmath15 spectra .",
    "those studies indicate that while the pion spectra can be described with the default pythia settings , ( i.e. qcd processes at leading order ) the proton spectra require the inclusion of a k - factor  @xcite ! !",
    "( qcd processes with higher order corrections ) .",
    "hence it is not possible to reach a consistent reproduction of the experimental data .",
    "the hijing generator dedicated to heavy ion reactions does not reproduce the proton spectra in a similar way as pythia .",
    "one has to add that neither of them includes the radial flow in the simulation , an important issue to describe results of heavy ions collisions .",
    "we use the pythia 6.3 generator with the popcorn baryon production mechanism .",
    "one can change parameters in the event generator , like the fragmentation function , and/or the hadronization mechanism .",
    "recently it has been shown  @xcite that the differences in the proton / pion ratio at 200 gev among different baryon production mechanisms are not very large so that we limit ourselves to the use of the popcorn hadronization mechanism in the pythia generator - the one that is expected to give the best conditions for proton production . the hijing 1.32 event generator has been used to generate @xmath2 and pp events , with default values of the parameters , for instance , including partonic energy loss , shadowing effects , among other phenomena . the pp collision with hijing was generated with the default set of parameters .",
    "the radial flow is understood as representing the azimuthally symmetric collective aspects of the interacting hadronic medium  @xcite , depending on the collision energy .",
    "the relevant observable to study the radial flow is the transverse momentum of the particles . for each particle",
    ", the random thermal motion is superimposed onto the collective radial flow velocity .",
    "consequently , the invariant @xmath15 distributions depends on the temperature at freeze out , the particle mass , and the velocity profile of the flow .",
    "the experimental data on radial flow at rhic indicate that the kinetic freeze out temperature and the observed flow are anti - correlated .",
    "the temperature decreases with centrality while the flow velocity increases  @xcite . from the most peripheral to the most central the flow for heavy ions collisions rises from @xmath4 @xmath28 to @xmath4 @xmath29 .",
    "we propose to introduce radial flow , to event generators as follow : in a first step we generate _ flow - free _ pion and proton spectra using an event generator to produce particles .",
    "+ we are assuming that a fireball , thermalized , and expanding was created in the collision .",
    "the expansion produces an additional momentum to the one created in the collisions using event generators .",
    "this contribution we call momentum of the radial flow @xmath30 given by @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the lorentz factor , @xmath33 is the profile velocity and @xmath34 is the mass of the particle under consideration .",
    "this radial component is generated in a random way in the transverse plane and is added vectorially to the transverse momenta produced by the generators , supposed not to contain flow .",
    "once the vector sum is achieved , the transverse momentum @xmath15 , of each particle generated includes now the radial flow",
    ". then we can select the pions and protons and estimate the ratio comparing the results with and without flow versus experimental data .",
    "+ the radial flow described above can be added to any event generator in order to compare among them and with the experimental data .",
    "the flow contribution considerably alters , as expected , the shape of the momentum spectra in the range 0 to @xmath35 gev / c . the fig .",
    "[ auau - pt ] represents a typical momentum spectrum for pions ( left ) and protons ( right ) , obtained for central @xmath2 collisions with a velocity profile of the flow , @xmath36 . in the same figure",
    "we show the phenix spectra  @xcite to show the degree of agreement between the spectra obtained with our model and data .",
    "spectra for @xmath1 collisions using hijing or pythia shown in the fig .",
    "[ pt - pp - auau ] indicate that there are notable differences above 1  gev / c , between the two generators .",
    "the differences are probably due to the parton distribution functions used and/or the fragmentation functions .",
    "spectra for pions ( left ) and protons ( right ) obtained applying the afterburner to @xmath2 central collisions generated by hijing with a flow of @xmath37.,title=\"fig : \" ]      fig .",
    "[ auau-0 - 10x100a ] shows the results of our calculation including the flow in the generator , for the proton to pion ratio for @xmath2 collisions , compared to two experimental results , phenix  @xcite and star  @xcite for the most central collision .",
    "we also plotted the results without flow ( @xmath38 ) , to illustrate the importance of the flow the contribution to the ratio .",
    "the other centralities are also reasonably described using lower flow parameters , following the experimental results , as shown in fig .",
    "[ auau-0 - 10x100b ] . without trying to get the best fit ,",
    "the distributions show a qualitative agreement with the experimental results with a rise and a subsequent decrease of the ratio at @xmath15 values from @xmath39 gev / c onwards , for the three different centralities .",
    "the data for protons at 62.4 gev are difficult to analyze using hijing . the hijing generator at this energy , namely , overestimates grossly the proton production with respect to pions .",
    "this is due , in our opinion , to the fact that hijing overestimates the contribution of valence quarks at these momenta thus grossly overestimating the proton production compared to the antiproton one , in the same way as it underestimates the @xmath40 ratio at these momenta . in the left part of the fig .",
    "[ auau-0 - 10 - 62 ] , we show the results of the hijing predictions of @xmath0 compared with and without the afterburner versus data .",
    "the results are completely different for anti - proton to pion ratio .",
    "the right part of the fig .",
    "[ auau-0 - 10 - 62 ] , show the @xmath41 data of star@xcite with the hijing predictions with and without afterburner .",
    "it is visible that the two predictions are completely different and that the afterburner again qualitatively reproduces the data although they suggests perhaps a somewhat larger flow .",
    "let us note that the trend of our model is to predict the position of the maximum ratio at lower momenta than at 200 gev in agreement with the data , while the coalescence models used in ref  @xcite show an opposite behavior .",
    "the fact that even the ratios obtained in @xmath1 collisions can not be satisfactorily explained with current generators as discussed by  @xcite , prompted us to apply our model to them since the experimental analysis of the spectra in @xmath1 yields a value of 0.2c like in the case of peripheral @xmath2 collisions .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ auau-60 - 92x100 - 1 ] the results obtained for the very peripheral - quasi @xmath1 like collisions using our afterburner one with hijing ( left ) and one with pythia ( right ) .",
    "we find that pythia requires a very large flow to fit the data while hijing with a moderate flow similar to the one extracted from the experiments , fits reasonably well .",
    "this illustrates that the ratio depends crucially on the `` initial spectrum '' , as discussed in section 2 ( fragmentation functions , parton distribution functions , etc . ) .",
    "also it should be mentioned that the hijing event generator implements the nuclear effects like shadowing , energy loss , etc . even in peripheral collisions .",
    "results from star  @xcite @xmath1 collisions have been compared with hijing events . in fig .",
    "[ auau-60 - 92x100 - 2 ] we show this ratio . as in the case of peripheral data a good agreement is achieved incorporating the radial flow to the hijing spectra , albeit the flow used is somewhat larger than the one found experimentally .",
    "we have introduced radial flow in existing event generators ( pythia and hijing ) via an afterburner . the flow parameters that fit reasonably well the experimental results both in the proton to pion ratio and the @xmath15 spectra are very close to the ones extracted from experiments in a thermal analysis .",
    "the success in reproducing qualitatively the data in a wide range of centralities , and in a large range of transverse momentum indicates that the presence of radial flow should be taken in consideration in any attempt to explain the so called proton puzzle .    in the present work we did not try to reproduce in details",
    "the ratios experimentally observed for two reasons ; first the systematical and statistical errors of the experimental results and second as has been shown the `` initial condition '' of the generator have influences on the shape of the spectra leads to difference in the results after implementation of the radial flow . + the inclusion of a flow in pp reactions is not justified in terms of an expanding thermal system , but since the analysis of the pion kaon and proton spectra do yield something that may be termed ",
    "flow  we can perhaps infer that the outward motion of jets produces an effect which does modify the hadron spectra in pp collisions .",
    "we would like to thank a. morsch for helpful discussions .",
