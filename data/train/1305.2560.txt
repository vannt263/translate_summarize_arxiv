    "squeezing in spin systems  @xcite has been an active research field in atomic , molecular , and optical physics .",
    "squeezing is one of the most promising candidates in precision measurement to go beyond the standard quantum limit ( sql )  @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that spin squeezing can be utilized for magnetometers  @xcite and atomic clocks  @xcite , while squeezed spin states have been demonstrated in several physical systems  @xcite .",
    "a squeezed spin state ( sss ) can be generated from a coherent spin state ( css )  @xcite in which @xmath0 pseudo spin-1/2 particles point the same direction with spin fluctuations perpendicular to the average spin direction being completely random .",
    "therefore , the magnitude of the spin fluctuations of a css is proportional to @xmath1 , which defines the standard quantum limit ( sql ) of spin systems .",
    "this sql can be surpassed by spin squeezing in which spin fluctuations in one direction are reduced at the expense of enhanced fluctuations in the other direction by making individual spin fluctuations quantum - mechanically correlated via nonlinear interactions  @xcite such as one - axis twisting and two - axis counter twisting .",
    "bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) of ultracold atomic gases with internal degrees of freedom , i.e. , spinor becs , are among the ideal candidates to achieve spin squeezing .",
    "becs can naturally be prepared in any desired css and versatile tools for introducing nonlinear interactions necessary for spin squeezing are available .",
    "one - axis twisting can be realized by the josephson coupling between two condensate modes  @xcite and atom - field interactions  @xcite . in the case of pseudo spin-@xmath2 becs",
    ", squeezing has been extensively investigated by utilizing two appropriate magnetic sublevels or two - mode condensates  @xcite .",
    "in fact , quantum fluctuations below the sql have been observed in two - mode becs with the josephson - type one - axis twisting  @xcite .    in the case of pseudo spin-@xmath2 becs ,",
    "spin squeezing is the only possibility for reducing quantum fluctuations since the square of any pauli matrix is equal to the identity operator and the anti - commutator of any two different pauli matrices vanishes .",
    "therefore , only inter - spin correlations can be utilized for suppressing quantum fluctuations . however , other types of squeezing are possible for higher spins .",
    "a systematic investigation of squeezing for the case of spin-1 collective atomic systems is the primary purpose of this paper .    in the case of collective spin-1 systems ,",
    "the square of any spin-1 matrix @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) and the anti - commutator of two different spin matrices are not proportional to the identity matrix but represent the quadrupolar moments , namely , the nematic tensor ( or alignment tensor  @xcite ) , and the other multipolar moments can be expressed in terms of the spin vector @xmath5 and the nematic tensor .",
    "the spin and nematic - tensor operators constitute the su(3 ) lie algebra , which suggests a new trade - off relations between spin and nematic - tensor operators .",
    "this implies that we can control not only quantum fluctuations of the spin vector but also those of the nematic tensor by manipulating various types of correlations between non - commutative spin and nematic - tensor observables . here",
    ", we refer to squeezing on any two components of the spin vector as spin squeezing and that on any two components of the spin vector and the nematic tensor as spin - nematic squeezing  @xcite .",
    "the spin - nematic squeezing was first realized in ref .",
    "@xcite , which was recognized as spin squeezing in the spin and the alignment tensor , that is , the nematic tensor .",
    "recently , spin - nematic squeezing has experimentally surpassed 8db below the sql  @xcite .",
    "such a squeezing can be interpreted as two - mode squeezing involving two of the three magnetic sublevels of each spin-1 particle  @xcite .",
    "the spin - nematic squeezing is also referred to as @xmath6-@xmath7 spin squeezing and isospin squeezing within the su(3 ) framework  @xcite . squeezing induced by other types of correlations such as inter - nematic ones",
    "should also be possible .    in the present paper",
    ", we address the questions of what observables and to what extent we can squeeze beyond the sql for spin-1 becs .",
    "we will show that there exist two qualitatively different ( type-1 and type-2 ) classes of squeezing in spin-1 becs based on their underlying lie algebras .",
    "type-1 squeezing involves spin squeezing , while type-2 does spin - nematic squeezing , implying that type-1 squeezing and type-2 squeezing are unitarily equivalent to spin squeezing and spin - nematic squeezing , respectively . as we see later in details ,",
    "this leads us to a counterintuitive conclusion : we may generate both type-1 squeezing and type-2 squeezing from any css .",
    "a fully - polarized css with no nematicity can be spin - nematically squeezed and a polar css with zero averaged spin can be spin squeezed .",
    "we will also demonstrate that both type-1 squeezing and type-2 squeezing can be generated through one - axis twisting and discuss their squeezing limits .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] , we classify squeezing in spin-1 becs into two types , type 1 and type 2 , based on the underlying lie algebra . in sec .",

    "[ sec:4 ] , we summarize the main results of this paper . some complicated lie - algebraic manipulations are discussed in appendices to avoid digressing from the main subjects .",
    "we consider a bec consisting of @xmath0 identical spin-1 bosons and take a single - mode approximation to the bec , that is , we assume that all the bosons share the same spatial mode . then , the state of the system can be described by space independent one - particle creation and annihilation operators @xmath8 and @xmath9 , where @xmath10 indicates the magnetic sublevels @xmath11 .",
    "the second - quantized forms of the spin vector @xmath12 and the nematic tensor @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) in the basis of the magnetic sublevels are expressed as follows : @xmath15 @xmath16 here , @xmath3 expresses the spin matrix for the spin quantum number @xmath17 . as mentioned in the previous section , quantum fluctuations",
    "can be redistributed via squeezing between two non - commutative observables which can be expressed as linear combinations of @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",

    ", such operators can be expressed as eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 - 8 ] ) within the framework of the su(3 ) lie algebra .",
    "the su(3 ) lie algebra involves su(2 ) subalgebras whose triads of generators satisfy cyclic commutation relations such as @xmath27 = i{\\hat{j}}_z$ ] .",
    "these commutation relations lead to the trade - off relations in quantum fluctuations of the corresponding observables , and hence we can consider squeezing by choosing a triad of su(2 ) generators .",

    "lie algebra , we first construct the root diagram of the su(3 ) lie algebra as discussed in appendix  [ as1 ] .",
    "the root diagram , which uniquely determines the structure of the lie algebra , implies that the su(3 ) lie algebra involves two types of su(2 ) subalgebras , where @xmath28 defined in eq .",

    "similarly , any type-2 su(2 ) subalgebra can be transformed into a set of spin and nematic - tensor observables @xmath43 , in which spin - nematic squeezing has been observed  @xcite , which implies that squeezing in triads of a type-2 subalgebra can be considered to be equivalent to spin - nematic squeezing . here",

    "type-1 and type-2 squeezed states can be generated through one - axis twisting from a css . in the procedure of squeezing , we start with a bec prepared in a css which is nothing but the fock state defined as @xmath48 where @xmath49 can be written in terms of creation operators with magnetic sublevels @xmath11 as @xmath50 both type-1 squeezing and type-2 squeezing can be generated from an arbitrary fock state .",

    "<S> in spin-1 collective atomic systems , the spin and nematic - tensor operators constitute the su(3 ) lie algebra whose su(2 ) subalgebras are shown to give two distinct classes of squeezing which are unitarily equivalent to spin squeezing and spin - nematic squeezing . </S>",
    "<S> we explicitly construct a unitary operator that generates an arbitrary squeezed spin - nematic state from an arbitrary fock state . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we demonstrate that squeezed spin states can be generated from a polar state and that squeezed spin - nematic sates can be generated from a fully spin - polarized state . </S>"
