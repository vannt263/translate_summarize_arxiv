    "despite considerable progress over the last decade the problem of predicting the biological active structure of a protein solely from the sequence of amino acids has remained a formidable problem .",
    "more successful have been attempts to predict only the secondary structure . given the protein sequence it is today possible to determine the distribution and location of @xmath0-helices and @xmath1-sheets with up to @xmath3% probability .",
    "this high success rate indicates a close relation between sequence information and secondary structure .",
    "however , two observations indicate that this relation is not a simple one . first , certain sequences can form either @xmath0-helices or @xmath1-sheets @xcite .",
    "the most prominent example is the 11-residue chameleon peptide @xcite that folds as an @xmath4helix when replacing residue 22 - 32 of the primary sequence of the igg - binding domain of protein g ( 57 amino acids ) , but as a @xmath1-strand when inserted instead of residues 42 - 52 .",
    "secondly , it has become clear over the last years that miss - folding of proteins , often involving formation of @xmath1-sheets instead of @xmath0-helices , and subsequent aggregation is the cause of various illnesses including alzheimer s disease , bse and other prion diseases .",
    "hence , it is important to understand in detail how secondary structure formation and its role in the folding process depends on the intrinsic properties of the protein and the interaction with the surrounding environment .    in order to study these questions",
    "we have simulated a peptide whose sequence of amino acids ekaylrt ( glutamine - lysine - alanine - tyrosine - leucine - arginine - threonine ) appears in natural occurring proteins with significant frequency at positions of both @xmath0-helices and @xmath1-sheets .",
    "our present work differs therefore from previous investigations where we have focused on helix - formation and folding in homopolymers and artificial peptides @xcite .",
    "unlike these molecules that have a strong intrinsic tendency to form one specific kind of secondary structure elements ( @xmath0-helices ) , ekaylrt allows one to research the selection of either helix or sheet , or the transition between these two secondary structures , as a function of external factors .",
    "our work differs from similar approaches @xcite in that we study not minimal models but simulate detailed representations of our peptides where the interactions between all atoms are taken into account .",
    "ekaylrt is simulated both in gas phase and with an implicit solvent .",
    "quantities such as energy , specific heat , sheetness and helicity are calculated as functions of temperature .",
    "we find that both the solvated molecule and ekaylrt in gas phase form an @xmath0-helix when not interacting with other molecules .",
    "however , in the vicinity of a @xmath1-sheet the peptide prefers also to form strand . because of the resulting `` auto - catalytic '' property our peptide may therefore provide a simple model for the @xmath2 transition and the resulting aggregation process in some proteins that supposedly is related to the outbreak to neurological diseases such as alzheimer s and the prion diseases .",
    "our aim here is to research how secondary structure formation and its role in the folding process depend on either the intrinsic properties of a protein or its interaction with the surrounding environment . for this purpose ,",
    "we have considered detailed , all - atom representations of peptides that are based on the sequence of amino acids ekaylrt . to be more specific ,",
    "the peptide nh@xmath5-ekaylrt - cooh is studied both as an isolated molecule and interacting with another ekaylrt peptide that is held in a @xmath1-strand conformation .",
    "since our program package smmp @xcite in its current version allows only the simulation of single peptides we have modeled the latter case by considering the peptide nh@xmath5-ekaylrt - gggg - ekaylrt - cooh , with the c - terminal ekaylrt residues kept as a @xmath1-strand .",
    "the four glycine residues form a flexible chain that hold the two peptides together but allows their relative positions to vary .",
    "the underlying assumption is that the interaction between the two ekaylrt chains is the dominant term and their interaction with the glycine residues can be neglected .",
    "the intra - molecular interactions are described by a standard force field , ecepp/3,@xcite ( as implemented in the program package smmp @xcite ) and are given by : @xmath6 here , @xmath7 ( in  ) is the distance between the atoms @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the @xmath11-th torsion angle .",
    "the peptide bond angles are set to their common value @xmath12 .",
    "we further assume for the electrostatic permittivity in the protein interior @xmath13 ( its common value in ecepp simulations ) .",
    "simulations of our peptide ekaylrt in gas phase are compared with such where the interaction of the peptide with surrounding water is approximated by an implicit solvent @xcite : @xmath14 here , @xmath15 is the solvation energy and thought to be proportional to the solvent accessible surface area @xmath16 of the @xmath8th atom .",
    "the parameters @xmath17 are experimentally determined proportionality factors",
    ".    simulations of such detailed protein models are extremely difficult .",
    "this is because the various competing interactions lead to multitude of local energy minima separated by high barriers .",
    "hence , in the low - temperature region , canonical monte carlo or molecular dynamics simulations will get trapped in one of these minima and not thermalize within the available cpu time . only with the introduction of new and sophisticated algorithms such as _ generalized - ensemble _",
    "techniques @xcite , is it possible to alleviate this problem in protein simulations @xcite .",
    "for this reason , our investigations rely on the use of one of these techniques , multicanonical sampling @xcite , where conformations with energy @xmath18 are assigned a weight @xmath19 ( @xmath20 is that is the density of states ) .",
    "a simulation with this weight will generate a 1d random walk in the energy space and lead to a uniform distribution of energy : @xmath21 since a large range of energies are sampled , one can use the reweighting techniques @xcite to calculate thermodynamic quantities over a wide range of temperatures @xmath22 by @xmath23 where @xmath24 stands for configurations and @xmath25 is the inverse temperature .",
    "estimators for the multicanonical weights @xmath26 can be calculated with the iterative procedures described in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in our case we needed between 100,000 and 200,000 sweeps for the weight factor calculations .",
    "all thermodynamic quantities are then estimated from one production run of @xmath27 monte carlo sweeps that followed @xmath28 sweeps for `` thermalization '' .",
    "our simulations start from completely random initial conformations ( hot start ) and one monte carlo sweep updates every torsion angle of the peptide once . at the end of every 4th sweep , we store the total energy @xmath29 , the ecepp/3 energy @xmath30 , its partial terms @xmath31 and @xmath32 , the solvation energy @xmath33 , the corresponding end - to - end distance @xmath34 , and the number @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) of helical ( sheet ) residues . here , we follow previous work @xcite and consider a residue as helical if its backbone angle @xmath37 are within the range @xmath38 .",
    "similar , a residue is assumed to be `` sheet - like '' if @xmath37 are within the range @xmath39 .",
    "we start with presenting our results for a single ekaylrt molecule that is not interacting with other molecules .",
    "we display for this peptide in fig .",
    "1 the average helicity @xmath40 as a function of temperature . shown",
    "are data obtained in gas - phase ( gp ) and such for simulations that rely on a solvent accessible surface area term ( asa ) to approximate protein - water interactions .",
    "we observe in both cases a steep helix - coil transition that separates a high - temperature region with little helicity from a low - temperature region where most of the residues are part of an @xmath0-helix .",
    "the location of this transition can be determined from the corresponding peaks in the specific heat @xmath41 that are drawn in the inlet .",
    "we find as the helix - coil transition temperature of ekaylrt in gas phase @xmath42 k. the more pronounced peak for the solvated molecule indicates a temperature @xmath43 k that is considerably lower than the one in gas phase .",
    "unphysiologically high helix - coil transition temperatures in gas phase , and their shift toward a more sensible temperature range when an implicit solvent is introduced , have been also observed in our earlier work on homopolymers @xcite .",
    "we show in fig .  2 as an example for the helical configurations that dominate below @xmath44 the lowest energy configuration found in a simulation of the solvated peptide ( @xmath45 kcal / mol ) .",
    "the lowest energy configuration in gas phase ( @xmath46 kcal / mol ) is also a helix ( structure not shown ) .",
    "the energy of these helical structures is by @xmath47 kcal / mol lower than the ones of the lowest found `` sheet - like '' configurations : @xmath48",
    "kcal / mol for the solvated peptide and @xmath49 kcal / mol for ekaylrt in gas phase .",
    "the preference for helical structures can be also seen in fig .",
    "3a where we display the free energy @xmath50 at @xmath51 k as a function of helicity @xmath35 and `` sheetness '' @xmath36 .",
    "note that for convenience we have chosen a normalization where the minimum in free energy takes a value of zero .",
    "both in gas phase and for the solvated molecule a funnel - like free - energy landscape is formed , with the free energy minimum at @xmath52 , i.e. for maximal helicity ( since the two terminal ends are flexible and will usually not be part of an helix , a fully formed helix has a length @xmath53 instead of @xmath54 ) .",
    "the absolute value of the free energy difference between coil and helix is much larger for the peptide in gas phase ( @xmath55 kcal / mol ) than it is for the solvated molecule ( @xmath56 kcal / mol ) indicating that the helix - coil transition is stronger for ekaylrt in gas phase than for the molecule in an implicit solvent .",
    "this is in agreement with earlier work where we have found similar results for polyalanine chains @xcite .",
    "the corresponding projection of the free energy landscape on the `` sheetness '' @xmath36 in fig .",
    "3b shows the opposite picture ; the free energy increase with the number of residues whose backbone dihedral angles takes values that are common in a @xmath57-sheet .",
    "coil structures are at @xmath51 k favored over sheet - like structures by @xmath58 kcal / mol in the implicit solvent and by @xmath59 kcal / mol in gas phase .",
    "the observed form of the free - energy landscape is caused solely by the intra - molecular interactions .",
    "this can be seen in fig .  4 where we plot for solvated ekaylrt the total energy @xmath29 , the internal energy @xmath30 and the solvation energy @xmath33 as a function of temperature . here , we have normalized all energy terms in such way that their value at @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) is zero .",
    "both @xmath29 and @xmath30 decrease with growing number of residues that are part of a helix while @xmath33 increases ( fig .  4a ) .",
    "hence , the protein - water interaction term opposes helix - formation .",
    "this result is reasonable as the protein - water hydrogen bonds compete with the intra - molecular hydrogen bonding in an @xmath0-helix and therefore weaken helix - formation in solution .",
    "however , the loss in solvation energy of @xmath62 kcal / mol with helix - formation is small when compared with the gain in @xmath63 kcal / mol , and on average , a completely formed helix ( @xmath64 ) has a total energy that is by @xmath65 kcal / mol lower than a coil configuration ( @xmath66 ) . not surprisingly , we observe the opposite behavior in fig .",
    "4b where we plot the same three energies as a function of `` sheetness '' @xmath36 .",
    "sheet - like configurations with large numbers @xmath36 have higher internal energy @xmath30 than such with @xmath67 while the solvation energy @xmath15 is lower .",
    "hence , while at @xmath51 k the protein - water interaction seems to favor strands and opposes helix - formation , the physics of our molecule is dominated by the intra - molecular energies that lead to a strong preference for @xmath0-helix formation .",
    "5 indicates that this behavior is mainly due to the van der waals interaction between the atoms in the peptide . in this figure",
    ", we display as a function of temperature besides the van der waals term @xmath68 also the other partial energies that together make up @xmath69 : the average electrostatic energy @xmath70 , the hydrogen - bond energy @xmath71 and the torsion energy @xmath72 .",
    "our results so far indicate that the peptide ekaylrt has a intrinsic tendency to form helices .",
    "strands have of order @xmath73 kcal / mol higher free energies and are rarely observed .",
    "this result is independent on whether the molecule is in gas phase or simulated with an implicit solvent .",
    "however , ekaylrt appears _ within _ proteins both in helices and @xmath1-sheets .",
    "it follows that sheet formation has to be due to the interaction of the peptide with its surrounding .",
    "we conjecture that ekaylrt forms a @xmath1-sheet if it is in the proximity of another strand .",
    "especially , we assume that this process also happens if the peptide is close to another ekaylrt peptide that is already in a strand configuration .",
    "unfortunately , the present version of smmp does not allow the simulation of two interacting proteins .",
    "hence , in order to test our conjecture , we have studied instead the peptide nh@xmath5-ekaylrt - gggg - ekaylrt - cooh with the c - terminal ekaylrt residues kept as @xmath1-strand .",
    "the four glycine residues form a flexible chain that hold the two ekaylrt - units together but allows their relative positions to vary .",
    "we refer to the so constructed peptide as molecule  a  .",
    "the end - to - end distance @xmath34 is a measure for the separation of the two ekaylrt chains .",
    "our conjecture implies that for large values of @xmath34 the n - terminal ekaylrt assumes an @xmath0-helix while for small values of @xmath34 ( i.e. close proximity to the c - terminal ekaylrt that forms a strand ) it should assume a @xmath1-sheet - configuration",
    ". we have therefore calculated from the multicanonical simulation of molecule  a  the helicity and sheetness of the n - terminal ekaylrt at @xmath74 .",
    "both quantities are displayed in fig .",
    "two regions are observed . for @xmath75   the n - terminal ekaylrt",
    "chain forms a complete helix and strands are rarely observed .",
    "hence , for these distances the n - terminal chain has a similar behavior as the isolated ekaylrt - peptide .",
    "however , for decreasing end - to - end distance , the helicity also decreases and vanishes for @xmath76  . at the same time",
    ", the sheetness increases and the peptide forms a @xmath1-sheet for @xmath77  .",
    "note that the average potential energy of helical configurations is with @xmath78 kcal / mol within the errorbars equal to that of sheet - like configurations ( @xmath79 kcal / mol ) .    in fig .",
    "7 , the projection of the free - energy landscape at room temperature ( @xmath51 k ) on the helicity and sheetness of the n - terminal ekaylrt residues is drawn . for convenience ,",
    "we have set in this figure the lowest - found value of the free - energy to zero as energies are only defined up to an additive constant .",
    "the contour lines are spaced by 2 kcal / mol .",
    "the free - energy landscape is only plotted for values of @xmath80 kcal / mol as values of the free energy grow rapidly outside of the drawn area .",
    "we observe again two minima , corresponding to fully formed helix and @xmath1-strands .",
    "examples of configurations that correspond to the two minima are shown in fig .",
    "both minima have comparable free energies and are separated by barriers of only 2 kcal / mol allowing an easy interchange between the two forms .    in order to understand in more detail why ekaylrt forms a @xmath1-strand when close to a molecule that is already in a @xmath1-sheet form , we have performed further simulations of nh@xmath5-ekaylrt - gggg - ekaylrt - cooh holding now not only the c - terminal ekaylrt - residues as a @xmath1-strand but forcing also the four connecting glycine residues into a turn .",
    "we refer to the so defined peptide as molecule ` b ' .",
    "the n - terminal ekaylrt - residues are now by construction in close proximity to the c - terminal ekaylrt - strand .",
    "hence , we expect that at room temperature the n - terminal ekaylrt chain will also form a @xmath1-strand .",
    "this conjecture is supported by fig .",
    "9 where we plot the average `` sheetness '' @xmath36 of the n - terminal ekaylrt - residues as a function of temperature .",
    "both in gas - phase and for simulations with a solvent accessible surface term , we find that on average more than 5 of the 7 residues are part of a sheet - like structure .",
    "@xmath81 decreases smoothly with growing temperature and the maximum in the specific heat is shallow .",
    "the transition is more pronounced for the peptide in an implicit solvent than for the one in gas - phase , and shifted toward lower temperatures .    unlike our previous simulations where the glycine residues could freely move , a large percentage of configurations are now at room temperature in a sheet - form .",
    "the increased statistics of these configurations allows for a better analysis of the factors that help to overcome the intrinsic propensity of ekaylrt to form an @xmath0-helix and lead to a @xmath1-sheet .",
    "table 1 lists the differences of various energies between structures where the n - terminal ekaylrt unit is a @xmath1-strand with structures where these residues form an @xmath0-helix .",
    "values are listed for the whole molecule ` b ' and such restricted to the n - terminal ekaylrt chains .",
    "also listed are the differences of both terms .",
    "the latter quantity is a measure for the interactions between these seven residues and the rest of the molecule ( that is kept fixed ) .",
    "we see from this table that at @xmath51 k configurations with the n - terminal ekaylrt chain in a sheet are energetically favored by 7 kcal / mol over such where these residues form an @xmath0-helix .",
    "this energy - bias is found for all partial energies with the exception of the solvation energy term @xmath33 and the torsion energy term @xmath82 . while their values seems to indicate a slight preference for helical over sheet - like configurations , they are within the errorbars compatible with zero suggesting that both terms show no preference for one of the two forms .    because of the bias in the internal energies @xmath83 of the whole molecule ` b ' , @xmath1-sheet - like conformations of the n - terminal ekaylrt chain dominate at room temperature . however , the behavior of the various energy terms is different when one considers only the contributions by these seven residues . with the exception of the solvation energy @xmath84 , that favors @xmath1-strands , all energy terms favor now a helix . on average ,",
    "helical structures have at @xmath51 k a @xmath85 kcal / mol lower energy @xmath86 than strands when only the interaction between atoms in these seven residues are considered .",
    "hence , their behavior is qualitatively the same as for the isolated ekaylrt - peptide where we also observed a strong bias toward helical conformations .",
    "again , we find also that the van der waals energy @xmath87 is the dominant term .",
    "it follows that the @xmath1-sheet configurations that dominate when the ekaylrt residues are build into molecule ` b ' are caused by the interaction between this chain and the `` background '' of the rest of the molecule .",
    "since energies are additive , we can calculate this `` background''-field by @xmath88 the strength of the interaction between the peptide and the `` background field '' of the rest of molecule ` b ' can be seen from the large energy - difference of @xmath89 kcal / mol by that these interactions favor a strand .",
    "the main contribution comes from the van der waals term ( @xmath90 kcal / mol ) which is almost three times as large as the electrostatic and torsion energy terms .",
    "note that eq .",
    "[ background ] tell us also that the `` background '' given by the fixed parts of molecule`b ' raises the solvation energy difference @xmath91 kcal / mol of the ekaylrt - chain by @xmath92 kcal / mol to a value of @xmath93 kcal / mol for the whole system .",
    "this is because the term @xmath94 is due to the competition between hydrogen - bond formation in an @xmath0-helix and hydrogen - bond formation between the peptide and the surrounding water .",
    "however , in molecule ` b ' the peptide is geometrically constraint in such a way that this competition is replaced by one between hydrogen - bond formation in an @xmath0-helix of the n - terminal ekaylrt on one side , and formations of hydrogen - bonds between the peptide and the c - terminal ekaylrt - residues on the other side ( see also the opposite sign in the terms @xmath95 and @xmath96 in table 1 ) . as a result ,",
    "both the solvation energy difference @xmath97 and hydrogen - bond energy difference @xmath98 are marginal .",
    "instead , the preference of @xmath1-sheet configurations for ekaylrt in the `` background '' of the fixed rest of molecule ` b ' seems to be mainly due to the electrostatic and van der waal s energies .",
    "this is reasonable : a @xmath1-sheet conformation allows for an average closer distance between the atoms of the n - terminal ekaylrt - chain and the existing @xmath1-strand of the c - terminal ekaylrt - residues , decreasing in this way the van der waals energy . at the same time",
    ", the alignment of the two @xmath1-strands leads also to a favorable alignment of the dipole moments associated with each residue lowering therefore the electrostatic energy .",
    "we conjecture that without the stereometric constraints imposed by the connecting glycine residues the two strands would move together and aggregate as the energy gain increases with decreasing distance between them .",
    "our above presented results for molecule ` a ' and molecule ` b ' suggest auto - catalytic properties for ekaylrt : if the peptide forms a strand , in becomes energetically favorable for other nearby ekaylrt molecules to transform themselves into a sheet ( instead of the normally preferred helix ) , and eventually to aggregate with the first one .",
    "this behavior is similar to the mechanism thought to be responsible for the outbreak of neuro - degenerative illnesses such as alzheimer s or the prion diseases .",
    "outbreak of theses illnesses is associated with the appearance of a miss - folded structure that differs from the correctly folded one by a @xmath1-sheet instead of an @xmath0-helix .",
    "the miss - folded structure is thought to be auto - catalytic , that is its presence leads to a structural transition by which the correctly folded ( helical ) structure changes into the harmful @xmath1-sheet form .",
    "hence , peptides that contain the sequence of amino acids ekaylrt can serve as simple models to study these @xmath2-transition and the mechanism of prion diseases .",
    "for instance , our investigation suggest that the formation of @xmath1-sheets can be minimized by shielding the surface area of already existing @xmath1-sheet forms minimizing in this way the van der waals interaction",
    ". another possibility may be to introduce metal ions that alter the electrostatic interaction decreasing in this way the energy bias toward @xmath1-sheets .",
    "we have performed multicanonical simulations of peptides that contain the sequence of amino acids ekaylrt .",
    "we find that the ekaylrt - peptide itself has both in gas - phase and in solution an intrinsic tendency to form an @xmath0-helix .",
    "however , the peptide assumes a @xmath1-sheet form when close to another strand .",
    "the transition from an @xmath0-helix toward a @xmath1-sheet is caused by strong van der waals und electrostatic energy terms that favor the @xmath1-sheet form when ekaylrt is in close proximity to another strand .",
    "this `` auto - catalytic '' property of ekaylrt , that induces strand - formation in other ekaylrt molecules when in a @xmath1-sheet configuration , suggests that the ekaylrt based peptides can serve as a simple model for the @xmath2-transitions and successive aggregation that are supposed to be related to the outbreak of various illnesses such as alzheimer s or the prion diseases .",
