    "we summarize the present work in section [ sec : concs ] and compare our new values of @xmath3 with other constraints on @xmath0-variation .",
    "the relative wavelength separation between the two transitions of an alkali doublet ( ad ) is proportional to @xmath18 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . @xcite first analysed ad separations seen in seyfert galaxy emission spectra to obtain constraints on @xmath0-variation .",
    "absorption lines from intervening clouds along the line of sight to qsos are substantially narrower than intrinsic emission lines and therefore provide a more precise probe .",
    "@xcite first used ad absorption lines which seemed to be intrinsic to the qso",
    ". narrower still are absorption lines arising from gas clouds at significantly lower redshift than the background qso .",
    "@xcite first analysed mgii doublets from a damped lyman-@xmath0 system at @xmath19 . since then , several authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have applied the ad method to doublets of several different species ( e.g.  civ , siii , siiv , mgii and aliii ) .    in @xcite",
    "we obtained the strongest current ad constraint on @xmath3 by analysing 21 siiv doublets observed towards 8 qsos with keck / hires .",
    "we found a weighted mean @xmath20 the systematic error due to uncertainties in the @xcite siiv laboratory wavelengths is @xmath21 .",
    "recently , @xcite analysed 44 [ oiii ] doublet qso emission lines from the sloan digital sky survey early data release @xcite .",
    "their constraint , @xmath22 , is an order of magnitude weaker than equation [ eq : si ] .",
    "however , if one allows or expects spatial variations in @xmath0 , such a simplistic comparison is difficult since the two results constrain @xmath3 in very different environments ( i.e. qso emission regions and intervening absorption clouds ) .",
    "the many - multiplet ( mm ) method was introduced in @xcite and @xcite as a generalisation of the ad method .",
    "the mm method constrains changes in @xmath0 by utilizing many observed transitions from different multiplets and different ions associated with each qso absorption system .",
    "the full details behind this technique are presented in @xcite .",
    "we presented a summary in and listed the many important advantages the mm method holds over the ad method , including an effective order - of - magnitude precision gain .",
    "therefore , we only outline the salient features of the method below .    for small shifts in @xmath0 ( i.e.  @xmath23 ) , the rest wavenumber , @xmath24 , of a transition with a measured redshift , @xmath4 , in a qso spectrum , can be written as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the wavenumber measured in the laboratory with respect to @xmath0 is required for @xmath27 ( i.e.  for @xmath24 sufficiently close to @xmath26 ) . ] . if @xmath28 then @xmath29 are non - zero and the magnitude and sign of @xmath30 and @xmath31 determine the shift in the transition wavenumber . since we only consider @xmath23 , we may write @xmath32 where we consolidate @xmath30 and @xmath31 into @xmath33 . the @xmath34 coefficient represents all the relativistic corrections for the transition of interest and varies both in magnitude and sign from transition to transition .",
    "that is , if @xmath35 , the qso absorption lines will be shifted in a distinct pattern with respect to their laboratory values .",
    "[ fig : q_vs_wl ] illustrates the distribution of @xmath34 coefficients for the different transitions used in the mm method .",
    "the @xmath34 coefficients are calculated in @xcite using many - body techniques to include all dominant relativistic effects .",

    "the uncertainties in @xmath34 are typically @xmath36 for the mg , si , al and zn transitions but are @xmath37 for those of cr , fe and ni due to the more complicated electronic configurations involved . however , it is important to note that , in the absence of systematic effects in the qso spectra , the form of equation [ eq : omega_z ] ensures that errors in the @xmath34 coefficients can not lead to a non - zero @xmath3 .",
    "@xcite first applied the mm method to 30 keck / hires qso absorption systems ( towards 14 qsos ) in the absorption redshift range @xmath38 , fitting only the transitions of mgi , mgii and feii .",
    "the large positive @xmath34 coefficients for the feii transitions are in sharp contrast to the small values for the mg transitions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : q_vs_wl ] ) : the mg lines act as anchors against which the large shifts in the feii lines can be used to constrain @xmath3 .",
    "the difference in @xmath34 values ( @xmath39 ) is much larger than for the siiv transitions in the ad method ( @xmath40 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and so the mm method allows significantly increased precision .",
    "additionally , analysing the 5 feii and 3 mg transitions allows a statistical gain over the ad method .",
    "@xcite explicitly demonstrated this increased precision , obtaining tentative evidence for a smaller @xmath0 in the absorption clouds : @xmath41 .",
    "in we analysed 18 independent keck / hires absorption systems in the range @xmath42 . at these higher redshifts , shorter ( rest )",
    "wavelength transitions are shifted into the optical bandpass .",
    "[ fig : q_vs_wl ] shows the range of @xmath34 coefficients available and their complex arrangement compared to the low-@xmath4 mg / feii systems .",
    "such an arrangement should provide more robust estimates of @xmath3 since any systematic effects in the qso spectra will have a different effect on systems containing different transitions . despite this",
    ", the high-@xmath4 sample also yielded evidence for a smaller @xmath0 in the past , consistent with the low-@xmath4 systems . combining this with a re - analysis of the @xcite data and including 3 low-@xmath4 mg / feii systems from the new data",
    ", we found 4.1@xmath7 evidence for a variable @xmath0 with 49 absorption systems over the range @xmath43 : @xmath44    such a potentially fundamental result requires extreme scrutiny and warrants a thorough examination of possible systematic errors .",
    "we carried out a detailed search for both instrumental and astrophysical systematic effects in but were unable to identify any which explained the result in equation [ eq : m01a_res ] .",
    "upper limits were placed on potential effects from atmospheric dispersion and possible isotopic abundance evolution but we indicated that further exploration of these possibilities was required .    in the present work we analyse a new , large sample of keck / hires absorption systems using the mm method .",
    "we also re - analyse the previous datasets and significantly improve the analysis of potential systematic errors .",
    "the qso observations were carried out by three independent groups , all using the high resolution spectrograph ( hires , * ? ? ? * ) on the keck i 10-m telescope on mauna kea , hawaii .",

    "we have reanalysed these samples ( section [ sec : analysis ] ) in a way consistent with the new , larger dataset described in the next section .",
    "the main improvement on our previous results is due to a new dataset kindly provided by w.  l.  w. sargent .",
    "the observations were carried out during numerous observing runs from 1993 november to 1999 november .",
    "the spectral resolution for most spectra was @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "all spectra were reduced with the makee package written by t. barlow .",
    "qso exposure times ranged from 10006000s depending on the qso magnitude and between 316 separate exposures were combined to form the final spectrum .",
    "thorium  argon ( thar ) emission lamp spectra , taken both before and after the qso exposures , were used to calibrate the wavelength scale .",
    "makee uses an internal list of thar air wavelengths derived using the @xcite formula from the measured vacuum thorium atlas of @xcite and the argon atlas of @xcite .",
    "makee then converts the final wavelength scale to vacuum wavelengths using the cauchy formula from @xcite and not the ( inverse of the ) edlen formula . as we noted in",
    ", this distortion of the wavelength scale could lead to systematically non - zero values of @xmath3 .",
    "for example , the effect on a @xmath50 mg / feii system would be a spurious @xmath51 .",
    "we have corrected the wavelength scales of the reduced spectra to avoid such a distortion ( see for details ) .",
    "we test the accuracy of this wavelength scale in section [ ssec : thar ] .",
    "the effect of slight miscalibrations ( if any are present ) on the overall @xmath3 values is found to be negligible .",
    "for each qso spectrum we identified all absorption systems which contained enough mm transitions to yield meaningful constraints on @xmath3 .",
    "we selected @xmath52500-kms@xmath53 sections around each transition and defined a continuum by fitting a legendre polynomial .",
    "1@xmath7 error arrays were generated assuming poisson counting statistics . the average s / n per pixel for these spectral regions of interest ranged from 4240 , with most sections having @xmath54 ( see fig .  [",

    "the new sample comprises 78 absorption systems , observed towards 46 qsos , covering a wide redshift range , @xmath1 . like the previous samples , the new sample conveniently divides into low-@xmath4 ( @xmath55 ) and high-@xmath4 ( @xmath56 ) subsamples .",
    "table [ tab : samples ] shows the number of times each transition is used in the different subsamples .",
    "mg / feii systems dominate the low-@xmath4 region : 35 out of the 44 systems below @xmath57 contain only feii and mgi or ii , and , out of the remaining 9 , only 1 system does not contain transitions of these ions .",
    "we provide an example mg / feii absorption system , together with our voigt profile fit , in fig .",
    "[ fig : q1437 ] . note that fitting a large number of transitions allows the velocity structure of the absorption system to be reliably determined .",
    "this is further facilitated by the range in feii oscillator strengths and the presence of the weak mgi line .",
    "the high-@xmath4 systems are characterized by a diverse range of transitions from different ionic species .",
    "table [ tab : samples ] shows that the strong siii @xmath581526 , alii @xmath581670 and feii @xmath581608 transitions are the most common .",
    "[ fig : q0528 ] illustrates a particularly high column density absorber which contains the lower abundance species , crii , niii and znii .",
    "theoretically , the large magnitude of the @xmath34 coefficients for the transitions of these species makes them very important for constraining @xmath3 ( see fig .  [",

    "the results are binned in the same way as the simulations but the error bars represent the 1@xmath7 error in the weighted mean of values within each bin .",
    "of particular note is the large scatter in the post - removal values compared to the size of the rms error bars in the simulations .",
    "the scatter is also large compared to the post - removal shift in @xmath3 seen in the compression simulations .",
    "we explained the origin of the extra scatter at high-@xmath4 in section [ ssec : scat ] and formed the fiducial sample by adding an additional random error to the systems likely to be most strongly affected .",
    "we expect this scatter to significantly increase as transitions are removed from the fit , as in the present case .",
    "the degree of extra scatter is , to some extent , represented by the large uncertainties in the unweighted means presented in table [ tab : comp ] .",
    "these values should therefore be far more reliable in such circumstances .",
    "it is therefore clear that the potential power of the compression test ( demonstrated in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : cps_comp_exp]a ) is undermined by the extra scatter in the high-@xmath4 values .",
    "unfortunately , one can draw no conclusions about potential systematic errors from the compression test without a significant increase in high-@xmath4 sample size .",
    "if simple systematic errors are responsible for our measured non - zero @xmath3 , it is surprising that @xmath3 is so consistent between the low- and high-@xmath4 samples .",

    "it would also be surprising if we were to take subsets of the qso absorption lines , grouped according to the sign and magnitude of @xmath34 , and find consistent values of @xmath3 .",
    "we can apply such a test to the high-@xmath4 sample only , since it contains transitions with several distinct types of @xmath34 coefficient ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : q_vs_wl ] ) .",
    "we have applied this high-@xmath4 @xmath34-type removal test to 26 absorption systems .",
    "these contained at least one transition of each of the highly delineated @xmath34-types , i.e.  anchors , positive- and negative - shifters .",
    "21 of these systems also contain at least one mediocre - shifter .",

    "although removing the anchors , mediocre - shifters and negative - shifters produces only small changes in @xmath3 , removing the positive - shifters seems to cause to a significant change .",
    "however , two important caveats should be noted : ( i ) the pre- and post - removal values of @xmath3 are not independent of each other .",
    "this also applies to the 1@xmath7 error bars .",
    "( ii ) after removing the positive- and negative - shifters , the errors in the unweighted mean values are large , indicating a large scatter in @xmath3 .",
    "both these points make the results in table [ tab : hizq ] difficult to interpret . as in the previous section ,",
    "the unweighted mean values should be far more reliable than the weighted means due to the extra scatter .",
    "this is confirmed below .    as for the high-@xmath4 compression test , comparison with simulations",

    "we have applied the @xmath34-type removal test to the 3 simulations described in section [ sssec : rem_comp ] .",
    "the results are shown in the lower three panels of fig .",

    "also , in the simulations of compressed spectra , we see that removing the anchor transitions [ panel ( b ) ] does not significantly affect the values of @xmath3 . however , the effect is more significant when the positive- and negative - shifters are removed .",
    "overall , we see @xmath3 decrease when the positive - shifters are removed whereas removing the negative - shifters increases @xmath3 .",

    "[ fig : cps_comp_exp ] , the results are confused by the significant scatter in the post - removal qso values .",
    "we even observe extra scatter when removing the anchors from the real qso data .",
    "again , this extra scatter is expected .",
    "we also expect it to be worse here than for the compression test since ( i ) removing the positive- or negative - shifters significantly reduces the sensitivity of the mm method to @xmath3 , ( ii ) less absorption systems contain all three of the necessary @xmath34-types than systems contributing to either the compression or expansion samples and ( iii ) many combinations of transitions can be used for each absorption system in the compression test . also , by selecting systems which contain anchors , positive- and negative - shifters , we tend to select systems with transitions of very different line strengths ( e.g.  transitions of alii , crii and znii ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : q_vs_wl ] ) .",
    "we explained how this leads to extra scatter in values of @xmath3 in section [ ssec : scat ] and defined a ` high - contrast ' sample of 22 systems at high-@xmath4 .",
    "18 of these systems are contained in the sample of 26 systems where @xmath34-type removal is possible .",
    "the extra scatter is clearly apparent in fig .",

    "simulations indicate that removing transitions , grouped according to the magnitude and sign of @xmath34 , is a potentially powerful test for simple systematic errors in the high-@xmath4 data .",
    "however , the extra scatter in the values of @xmath3 for the relevant 26 absorption systems precludes any conclusion about the existence or magnitude of such systematic effects .",
    "we have used the mm method to analyse 3 samples of keck / hires qso spectra containing a total of 128 absorption systems over the redshift range @xmath61 . all 3 samples independently yield consistent , significantly non - zero values of @xmath3 ( table [ tab : stats ] , fig .",

    "the velocity structure is primarily constrained by the low optical depth transitions .",
    "any velocity components too weak to feature in low optical depth transitions may , nevertheless , subtly affect the fitted line positions of nearby velocity components in the high optical depth transitions .",
    "we have therefore increased the errors on @xmath3 for these systems to match the observed scatter .",

    "we have searched for possible instrumental and astrophysical systematic effects which could mimic the above evidence for varying @xmath0 . as we found in ,",

    "moreover , as discussed in section [ ssec : tempvar ] , one can not reliably compare these local limits with mm constraints on @xmath3 without a detailed theory giving both temporal _ and _ spatial variations of @xmath0 .",
    "the early universe constraints come from analysis of the cmb anisotropies ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and light - element ( e.g.  d , he , li ) big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) abundances @xcite .",

    "the least model - dependent limits are those of @xcite , @xmath107 , who , like @xcite , considered all light elements up to @xmath108li , thereby avoiding this problem .",

    "all the alternative methods discussed in the previous two sections constrain @xmath0 in ( sometimes model - dependent ) combination with other constants .",
    "therefore , the only current avenue for confidently ruling out the present evidence for varying @xmath0 is to obtain _ independent mm constraints from qso spectra_. the present work has shown that no known systematic errors can mimic the effect of varying @xmath0 in the keck / hires spectra .",
    "however , if subtle , unknown instrumental effects cause the line - shifts we observe , the high quality spectra now available from the vlt / uves and subaru / hds will bear this out",
