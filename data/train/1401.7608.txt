    "the most prominent example , recently realized experimentally @xcite , is the two - component fermi gas . in the mott phase with one atom per site",

    "the mott transition in a bosonic hubbard model is dramatically modified by the presence of such a field @xcite , and deep in the mott phase the gauge field supports phases with exotic magnetic ordering @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite that the internal degrees of freedom can also be used for simulating an `` extradimension '' , once the internal states are properly coupled to provide the hopping between the synthetic sites given by the atomic species .    in this paper",
    ", we study the case of a spatially homogeneous coupling of the atomic states , and analyze the mott phases in an @xmath0-component bose - hubbard model in the presence of coherent transfer between the internal states . in the extradimension picture of ref .",

    "@xcite , by shaking the optical lattice it is even possible to reverse the sign of the hopping term . in combination with spin - dependent lattices , this technique becomes species - selective and allows for generating non - abelian hopping terms @xcite .",

    "however , the main features of the ground - state of the effective hamiltonian in the mean - field approximation can be understood without calculations . in particular , the phase diagram of the model can be read off by comparing the different terms that are competing and the relative strength of the corresponding coupling constant @xmath142 , @xmath44 ( which are controlled by @xmath35 and @xmath5 ) , and @xmath284 .",
    "let us start by describing the term sourced by @xmath142 .",
    "within the gutzwiller ansatz it can written as @xmath285 , where the negative sign in the expectation value eq .  ( [ hgutz ] )",
    "is cancelled by the negative sign of @xmath142 .",

    "this tells us that whatever such term in the hamiltonian dominates over the others the ground - state is not translational invariant .",

    "this time we have @xmath289 . as the @xmath290 are normalized to 1",
    ", the modulus square of the scalar product can be at maximum 1 , when the vectors are parallel or anti - parallel .",
    "this implies that the minimization of @xmath291 appoints to translational invariant configurations . in view of the above considerations , it is crucial to determine which of the two terms , and under which conditions , wins over the other .",
    "it is worth to notice that if translational invariance of the ground - state is assumed , this corresponds to uniform superposition of @xmath258 states , i.e @xmath292 for any @xmath293 , as obtained analytically by minimizing the fourth order polynomial .",
    "as the phases of the @xmath294 are irrelevant we may choose for simplicity @xmath295 . such observation allows us to derive an not rigorous argument to decide which is the actual ground - state depending on the relative values of @xmath142 and @xmath44 when @xmath105 .",
    "the total energy per site of the translational invariant configuration above , @xmath296 , will be @xmath297 .",

    "depending on the value of @xmath42 , it is a certain eigenvector of the circulant matrix , @xmath302 , where @xmath303 is identified with 1 .",
    "for instance , for @xmath304 and @xmath305 , it is the one corresponding to its maximal and minimal eigenvalues , respectively . as maximal eigenvalue and the corresponding eigenvector for any number of species are 2 and @xmath295 for any @xmath293 , respectively , the ground - state at @xmath304 is @xmath298 for any @xmath64 ( by definition @xmath41 ) .",
    "in fact , the situation is more interesting for @xmath305 , or for any other value providing a degeneracy of two eigenvalues .",
    "the former is equivalent to reverse the sign of @xmath64 , and the eigenvector corresponding to the minimal eigenvalue has a non - trivial dependence on @xmath5 . in particular , for @xmath5 odd there are two degenerate states with minimal intra - species hopping term , @xmath306 , while for @xmath5 even the state is unique , @xmath307 , with @xmath308 .",
    "it is worth to notice that in the @xmath7 picture , where the different species correspond to layers in the _ compact _ extra - dimension ( as the hopping in @xmath64 acts as a circular matrix where @xmath303 is identified with 1 ) , a negative @xmath64 implies the presence of a magnetic @xmath309-flux in the compact dimension .    in view of the above consideration",
    ", the existence of at least one phase transition is predicted within the mean - field approximation due to the hopping term between species .",
    "indeed , starting with @xmath64 positive and decreasing it to negative values , the stable translational invariant phase determined by @xmath298 , becomes metastable and a new translational invariant state takes over . if @xmath5 is even , the ground - state is simply determined by @xmath310 . for @xmath5 odd",
    "the situation is slightly more involved : the minimal local state is given by the linear combination of the two minimal eigenvectors of the circulant matrix that minimizes the effective hamiltonian at @xmath105 .    at this stage",

    "@xmath314 , the main difference is that @xmath312 is replaced by the linear combination of two minimal eigenvectors of @xmath315 which minimize @xmath286 and @xmath291 .",
    "in fact , contrary to the su@xmath59-symmetric case , @xmath316 , the interaction part of the hamiltonian @xmath13 is not invariant under a change of basis to the eigenvalues of @xmath15 for generic @xmath35 .",
    "we conclude with two key observations .",
    "first , as in the su@xmath59-invariant case , checkerboard - like solutions can be achieved by considering species - dependent hopping term @xmath14 .",
    "second , again for any values of @xmath35 , the different states and phases can be distinguished by time of flight experiment combined with a stern - gerlach one .",
    "one of the major results we present here is that su@xmath59-breaking spatial hopping together with species mixing terms can induce inhomogeneous phases , i.e. the magnetization displays a crystal structure .",
    "note that in the extradimension picture , in which the different pseudo - spin states become different sites , such pattern becomes a density pattern .",
    "hence , the existence of mott states of such sort suggests the presence of superfluid phases respecting the same crystal structure , i.e. supersolid phases . such appearance is not totally surprising as the su@xmath59-symmetric interaction is long - range in the extradimension picture .",
    "in fact , a practical advantage of the synthetic dimension is that the long - range interaction is naturally not small .",
    "it is worth to notice that such scenarios naturally extend to approximately su@xmath59-symmetric interactions , which is more realistic for bosons .",
    "for @xmath317 , the hamiltonian reduces to @xmath13 , i.e.to the sum of local terms @xmath318 with @xmath319 where @xmath320 and @xmath321 . as minimizing @xmath322",

    "@xmath332 is unbounded from the below as the system tries to acquire as many particles as possible for any value of the chemical potential . precisely at @xmath338 , the energy of the system is not depending on the number of particles per site but only on their distribution between the different species .    for @xmath339 ,",
    "both the terms in @xmath336 and @xmath255s are convex . if @xmath340 is such that @xmath341 , for @xmath214 , @xmath342 , the minimum is achieved at @xmath343 for any @xmath344 , i.e. for a uniform distribution of particles @xmath345 , @xmath293 . for",
    "a generic value of @xmath340 , the terms in @xmath336 and @xmath255s compete .",
    "it can be shown that for @xmath346 the system admits only the commensurable filling @xmath341 with uniform distribution per species , while for @xmath250 the system explores configurations with exceeding particles over the uniform distribution . in practice , if we increase @xmath340 starting from @xmath347 , in the latter case the configuration with one particle added in any one of the species becomes less energetic than uniform configuration before @xmath340 reaches @xmath348 while in the former case it does not occur . indeed , by relabeling the species to have the extra particle in last one , @xmath343 , @xmath349 , @xmath350 , and the energy of such configuration is @xmath351 where @xmath352 is the energy of the uniform distribution with @xmath10 particle per species , and @xmath353 and @xmath354 are the gaps with respect to it of the configuration with an extra particle , and of the uniform distribution with @xmath11 particles per species , respectively .",
