    "however , this association is not quite one - to - one ; if @xmath16 is a quadratic extension unramified away from @xmath2 , then the set on the right can not distinguish between a curve @xmath10 and its quadratic twist by @xmath17 .",
    "the subscript `` twists '' indicates that the association is a bijection up to this family of twists ; of course , recovering the distinct twists is trivial once one curve in the family is known , since there are only a finite number of extensions @xmath16 with the necessary properties .",

    "once this correspondence is established , the search for picard curves with good reduction away from @xmath3 follows smart s program in many important respects .",
    "however , the project diverged from smart s work in the more delicate nature of the curves involved , which necessitated developing modified algorithms for determining all equivalence classes .",
    "this paper also includes one theoretical improvement to smart s approach : lemma [ lemma : infinite place ] makes the use of a @xmath26-adic lll reduction unnecessary .",
    "we may avoid using the bounds on @xmath26-adic logarithmic forms established by yu @xcite , as well as the @xmath26-adic lll algorithm used by smart @xcite .",
    "the primary result of the paper is the following :    up to @xmath0-isomorphism , there are exactly @xmath27 picard curves @xmath9 with good reduction away from @xmath3 . moreover , up to cubic twists , there are @xmath28 classes of such curves ; each of these contains exactly @xmath3 @xmath0-isomorphism classes of picard curves ( corresponding to the twists by @xmath29 ) .      in  [ sec :",
