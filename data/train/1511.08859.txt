    "in astrophysics there is a plethora of interesting questions related to the evolution of the universe , of processes responsible for energy generation in stars and how the nuclei that are observed on earth are formed .",
    "particularly , one is concerned with various processes in the pp - chain , cno - cycle , @xmath0-process , @xmath1-process , etc . ,",
    "through which elements are created in the universe .",
    "the knowledge of cross sections of some specific nuclear reactions such as capture reactions ( @xmath2 ) , ( @xmath3 ) , ( @xmath4 ) give important information about these processes .",
    "although direct experiment are preferable , in a large number of cases they are difficult to carry out .",
    "this is mainly due to the following reasons :    1 .",
    "experiments have to be performed at stellar energies which are usually very small ( of the order of tens or hundreds of kev / u ) .",
    "the cross sections for the reactions involving charged particles are very small ( nano barns or pico barns ) .",
    "often , even after long hours of data collection only a few events are obtained .",
    "background and stability problems have to be taken care of @xcite .",
    "direct measurements at low energies can also be affected by electron screening , requiring a difficult and uncertain treatment .",
    "an alternative way is to perform experiments at higher energies ( few mev / u ) and then extrapolate the results down to the desired energies .",
    "but this procedure also involves considerable uncertainties .",
    "2 .   many of the stellar reactions involve unstable nuclei with very short life time .",
    "to mitigate these problems , alternate indirect methods ( a combination of experimental and theoretical analysis ) are currently being used where equivalent information can be extracted by performing reactions at much higher beam energies .",
    "the indirect methods depend upon the type of reaction involved . of these",
    ", three indirect methods stand out in present day nuclear astrophysics : ( a ) asymptotic normalization coefficient method , ( b ) trojan horse method and ( c ) coulomb dissociation method .",
    "see , e.g. , the review articles @xcite .",
    "the asymptotic normalization coefficient ( anc ) method is based on the normalization of the tail of the quantum overlap of bound state wave functions of the initial and final nuclei @xcite .",
    "capture reactions in stellar environments take place either by direct capture or by resonant capture .",
    "direct capture reactions of charged particles usually involve systems with small binding energies and they are mostly peripheral at stellar energies . on the other hand , neutron capture reactions may contain contributions from the nuclear interior and are very sensitive to the spectroscopic factor ( sf ) of the final state @xcite .",
    "the presence of the coulomb barrier for charged particle capture causes the reaction to be peripheral .",
    "classically , if the incident particle energy is below the barrier then no capture will occur , however quantum mechanical ` tunneling ' gives a probability of barrier penetration .",
    "therefore , the capture in such case proceeds through the tail of the nuclear overlap of the initial and final bound state wave functions whose shape is completely determined by the coulomb force and the amplitude of the tail is given by the anc .",
    "although the anc method has been mostly used for charged particle direct capture reactions , it can also be used for neutron capture ( @xmath5 ) reactions , as explained in ref .",
    "one can extract the anc from differential cross section data of peripheral particle transfer reactions having the same vertex or from the one - nucleon breakup reaction of loosely bound nuclei .",
    "consider the virtual decay process @xmath6 .",
    "if @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the bound state wave functions for respective nuclei with @xmath10 s being the internal coordinates , then the overlap function is given by @xmath11 in the asymptotic limit ( when the nuclear forces are vanishingly small ) , the radial part @xmath12 of the overlap function can be expressed in terms of whittaker function ( @xmath13 ) , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the nuclear interaction radius of @xmath16 and @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the anc .",
    "it defines the amplitude of the tail of the radial overlap integral and it depends upon the structure of nucleus @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath20 and @xmath21 are the wave number and the coulomb parameter for the bound state @xmath22 , respectively . @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the orbital and total angular momentum of @xmath19 .    the above formalism of anc is based on the overlap integral and is also called schrdinger formalism as it involves wave functions and potentials",
    ". however , there is another way to incorporate anc in the theory of direct reactions .",
    "this formalism is based on general scattering theory and it is valid both in non - relativistic quantum mechanics as well as in field theory . here , the anc can be used to find the residues at the poles ( for bound or resonance states ) of the @xmath25-matrix for elastic scattering of the @xmath26 system . for more details about this method , see ref .",
    "the cross section for the direct radiative capture reaction @xmath27 can be written as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a kinematic factor , @xmath30 is the scattering wave function in the initial channel and @xmath31 is the electromagnetic transition operator connecting the initial and final channel and it does not involve the structure of the core @xmath16 . in the asymptotic limits the capture cross section [ eq .",
    "( [ a3 ] ) ] can be written as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a function independent over the bound state structure of @xmath19 .",
    "thus , the direct capture cross section completely depends upon the anc . by determining the anc from some other direct reaction experiment ( e.g. , from elastic scattering )",
    ", one can calculate the capture cross section at stellar energies .",
    "however , one should keep in mind the necessary conditions that the reaction chosen for extracting the anc should have the same vertex and also that it should be peripheral in nature .",
    "the common choices are ( i ) a transfer reaction between the heavy ions , having one of the vertices kept the same as the vertex for the desired direct capture reaction and ( ii ) a breakup reaction of loosely bound nuclei .",
    "consider the transfer reaction @xmath34 , with @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the vertex ( vertices ) for the direct radiative capture ( transfer ) reaction . the distorted - wave born approximation ( dwba )",
    "is used to analyze such type of peripheral transfer reactions .",
    "the dwba cross section ( @xmath37 ) for the transfer reaction can be related with the measured angular distribution of the nuclei by means of the relation @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) are the sf , and the orbital and total angular momentum of the respective nuclei .",
    "these sf s are related to the corresponding anc s of the overlap function by @xmath44 where @xmath45 s are the single particle anc s of the particle @xmath17 in the nuclei @xmath43 and @xmath19 whereas , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the anc s of the initial and final nuclei .",
    "therefore , eq . ( [ a5 ] ) can be written in terms of anc s as @xmath48    when more than one orbital participate , a summation over all the orbitals is required .",
    "for peripheral reactions , the ratio in eq .",
    "( [ a6 ] ) is independent of the single particle anc s ( @xmath45 s in the denominator ) , which also gives a criterion for peripheral reactions .",
    "therefore , by comparing the dwba cross section with the experimental result one can extract the spectroscopic factor and hence the anc ( @xmath49 ) for the vertex of interest ( @xmath50 ) , provided that the information about the other vertex ( @xmath51 ) ( i.e. @xmath52 ) is already known from other independent measurements .",
    "this method has been tested in several direct capture reactions to obtain astrophysical s - factors @xcite .    * * .",
    "it is a well known fact that loosely bound nuclei have one or two nucleon(s ) well detached from core nucleons and that they can be easily removed in the nuclear field of a target .",
    "such reactions are usually peripheral even at energies of few hundred mev / nucleon and they are dominated by the asymptotic tail of the removed nucleon wave function . from the measurement of momentum distributions of the core , one can extract the spectroscopic information about the relative orbital angular momentum of the fragments and contribution of the different single particle states @xcite . from the measured one - nucleon removal cross section one",
    "can also extract the anc for the capture process of interest @xcite .",
    "the one - nucleon removal cross section ( @xmath53 ) for the reaction @xmath6 can be written as @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the calculated single particle removal cross section .",
    "one has to take the sum over all the orbitals contributing to the total cross section .",
    "the advantage of this technique is that the one - nucleon removal cross sections are usually large even at high energies and therefore a beam of lesser quality can be used .",
    "this is an another indirect method , where the cross section of a suitable two - body to three - body reaction ( @xmath56 ) is used to extract the cross section for a relevant two - body reaction ( @xmath57 ) at stellar energies .",
    "this specific type of reaction ( two - body to three - body ) is called trojan horse ( th ) reaction and hence the method is known as the trojan horse method ( thm ) @xcite .",
    "a th reaction is chosen in such a way that nucleus @xmath43 contains @xmath17 in its cluster structure ( @xmath35 ) and this cluster @xmath17 interacts with @xmath16 , whereas the other cluster @xmath58 remains as a spectator .",
    "for this to happen , one has to keep quasi - free ( qf ) kinematical conditions for the clusters @xmath58 and @xmath17 , which is based on the consideration that the relative momentum between these clusters in the three - body phase space should be zero or small compared to the wave number of bound state ( @xmath59 ) @xcite . in that case",
    "the interaction between @xmath58 and @xmath17 would be small and hence they will stay at maximal distance from each other . in the above reaction",
    "if @xmath60 stands for @xmath61 then it represents a radiative capture reaction .",
    "in fact , this method is very flexible and can be used to study many other type of reactions and is not only limited to the radiative processes , such as the coulomb dissociation and the anc method . while performing an experiment with a th reaction",
    ", one has to pay attention to all the other possible reactions which can be triggered and that can act as background with respect to the desired reaction event .    as mentioned earlier ,",
    "the direct measurement of a capture cross section for the binary process @xmath57 at stellar energies is difficult because one has to take into consideration the electron screening effect and the extrapolation to low energies is not reliable because of unexpected resonances @xcite .",
    "however , one can use the thm to obtain cross sections down to the relevant ultra - low stellar energies .",
    "this is because the th reaction between @xmath43 and @xmath16 takes place at energies above the coulomb barrier so that @xmath16 can dig into @xmath43 and there is no possibility of additional an coulomb barrier between @xmath16 and @xmath17 . here",
    ", @xmath17 acts as a virtual particle and hence does not obey the energy - momentum relations for a free particle .",
    "therefore , the cross sections of the binary sub - process extracted from the th processes do not contain the related coulomb barrier and are free from electron screening .",
    "consequently , with this method one can determine the astrophysical s - factor s(e ) of the binary process @xmath62 at low relative kinetic energies of the particles @xmath17 and @xmath16 without being affected by electron screening .",
    "in addition , comparing the direct capture cross section with those obtained from the thm , one can determine the screening potential .    as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , in spite of the high energy ( @xmath63 ) of a projectile @xmath16 ( above the coulomb barrier of @xmath64 ) , the binary reaction @xmath65 still takes place at low relative energies @xmath66 because of the qf condition .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] describes the mechanism for the thm .",
    "if @xmath67 is the binding energy of intercluster @xmath68 in nucleus @xmath43 then the relative energy of @xmath69 is given by @xmath70 where @xmath71 s and @xmath72 s are the relative momenta and reduced masses of the respective pair .",
    "with the qf kinematics , @xmath73 , and also considering target @xmath43 at rest ( i.e. momentum @xmath74 ) in the lab system , the relative energy @xmath66 from eq ( [ a8 ] ) is @xmath75 with @xmath76 s being the masses of respective nuclei .",
    "thus , it is clear that due to the presence of the factor @xmath77 and the binding energy @xmath78 , the relative energy @xmath66 for the binary reaction remains very small and even negative in spite of high @xmath63 .    as mentioned earlier , in the qf kinematics ,",
    "there is negligible interaction of the spectator @xmath58 with @xmath19 and @xmath60 and hence in the final three - body state only the scattering of two fragments @xmath60 and @xmath19 is important .",
    "therefore , the plane - wave - impulse approximation ( pwia ) is used to analyze the experimental results in the thm . in this approximation",
    ", the three - body triple differential cross section for the th reaction is factorized as @xcite @xmath79 where    1 .",
    "@xmath29 is the kinematical factor which contains the final state phase space factor in terms of masses , angles and momenta of outgoing particles ( see ref .",
    "@xmath80 is the fourier transform of the bound state wave function of @xmath43 which describes the momentum distribution of @xmath43 at the final momentum of @xmath68 intercluster . for a nucleus @xmath43 having ground state angular momentum @xmath81 ,",
    "the application of this method is much simpler as the fourier transform of the ground state wave function peaks at zero momentum and is well known .",
    "this helps in determining the qf scattering angles . on the other hand , for high-@xmath82 nuclei",
    ", the momentum distribution becomes much broader and hence the internal separation of the fragments @xmath68 will be small and @xmath58 can no longer be treated as spectator .",
    "therefore , high-@xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) nuclei are less suitable for thm ( see ref .",
    "@xmath84 is the half - off - energy - shell ( hoes ) differential cross section for the two body reaction @xmath85 at relative kinetic energy @xmath86 of the @xmath69 system , such that @xmath87 . here",
    ", @xmath88 is the kinetic energy of the relative motion of @xmath60 and @xmath19 and @xmath89 is the @xmath89-value of the binary reaction .",
    "it is clear from eq .",
    "( [ a10 ] ) that after calculating the factors @xmath29 and @xmath90 , the hoes binary cross section can be obtained from the measured triple differential cross section of the th reaction as @xmath91 this binary hoes cross section is then used to extract the quantity of interest , namely , the on - energy - shell cross section by normalization to the direct data available at higher energies .",
    "the thm has been used in many theoretical and experimental studies of capture reactions with success .",
    "although , initially it has been used for charged particle capture reactions , now it has also been extended to study direct neutron and resonant capture reactions .",
    "the coulomb dissociation / breakup method ( cd ) is an another indirect method proposed by baur _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "as coulomb induced dissociation is an inverse to the radiative capture process , one can relate the measured coulomb dissociation cross section ( which can be measured at high beam energies and are larger in magnitude ) to the relevant radiative capture cross section of astrophysical interest . in this method",
    "the composite projectile @xmath17 consisting of two sub - structures @xmath45 and @xmath60 , is broken up in the coulomb field ( or electromagnetic field ) of a heavy target nucleus @xmath92 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) , @xmath93 where @xmath45 is the core nucleus and @xmath60 is a valence nucleon which can be charged or uncharged .",
    "the advantage of the cd method is that the measurements are performed at even higher beam energies and the cross sections are considerably larger as the energy increases",
    ". also at sufficiently high incident velocities the fragments @xmath45 and @xmath60 emerge with high energies which in turn facilitates their detection . with adequate kinematical conditions in coincidence measurements",
    "the study of low relative energies of the final state fragments is still possible @xcite .",
    "however , for the viability of the method one has to be ensure that the nuclear breakup effect should be negligible or should be known accurately . for a pure coulomb breakup ,",
    "a large impact parameter or small scattering angle is often required .",
    "furthermore , the breakup process is considered to be elastic , so that there will be no excitations in the target , although this condition can be relaxed if the energy transferred to the excitation is small compared to the bombarding energy , what is usually the experimental choice .    the coulomb breakup process [ eq . ( [ a12 ] ) ] ,",
    "is then related to the photodisintegration reaction @xmath94 , where one calculate the photodisintegration cross sections ( @xmath95 ) as @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the relative energy spectra in the coulomb breakup at relative energy @xmath98 of @xmath99 system , @xmath100 stands for either electric or magnetic transition of multipolarity @xmath101 , @xmath102 is the photon energy with @xmath103 as the @xmath103-value of the reaction and @xmath104 is the equivalent photon number ( also called virtual photon number ) and depends on the @xmath105 system ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . similar to eq .",
    "( [ a13 ] ) the angular differential cross section of the coulomb breakup can also be related to photo disintegration cross section as @xmath106 @xmath107 being the scattering solid angle .",
    "it has been found that relativistic effects , higher order and higher multipole s contribution can influence the reaction process @xcite and hence make it difficult to use eqs .",
    "( [ a13])-([a14 ] ) .",
    "one has to take these effects into account while using the cd method .",
    "when a single multipolarity of either type ( electric or magnetic ) dominates , the above equations can be easily used to find the photodisintegration cross section for the dominating multipolarity ( @xmath101 ) . using the ` principle of detailed balance ' the capture cross section ( @xmath108 ) for the desired capture process @xmath109 ,",
    "can be obtained from @xmath95 as @xmath110 where @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 are the spins of particles @xmath17 , @xmath45 and @xmath60 , respectively . @xmath114 and @xmath115 are the wave numbers of the photon and that of relative motion between @xmath45 and @xmath60 , respectively . as a word of caution ,",
    "the principle of detailed balance can not be used for the situations where capture leads to the bound excited states having unknown branching ratios of @xmath61-ray emission @xcite .",
    "the cd method has been used to determine the capture cross sections for numerous radiative capture stellar processes using both experimental and advanced theoretical studies ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in fact",
    ", there are different theoretical models used to study the coulomb dissociation . in refs .",
    "@xcite , a pure quantum mechanical model @xcite using the post - form dwba is used to calculate the radiative neutron capture cross section on @xmath116li , @xmath117c and @xmath118n from the coulomb breakup of @xmath119li , @xmath118c and @xmath120n , respectively . for @xmath118n(@xmath121)@xmath120n",
    ", there are large contributions from the capture to the low - lying bound excited states of @xmath120n .",
    "therefore , although theoretically such a study is possible , experimentally it is difficult as it requires additional information on the @xmath61-ray branching ratios for the excited states , similar to what was done in ref .",
    "recently , in refs .",
    "@xcite , the theory of coulomb dissociation @xcite ( for neutron exotic nuclei ) has been extended to include the projectile deformation .",
    "this further opens the door to study the affect of deformation on the neutron capture cross sections and subsequent rates for medium mass nuclei .",
    "in surrogate reactions such as ( d , p ) reactions , the neutron is brought to react with a nucleus inside a trojan , or surrogate nucleus ( here , the deuteron ) .",
    "such reactions are thought to give information on neutron - induced reactions , often not available in direct measurements .",
    "the neutron inside the deuteron has angular momentum and other quantum numbers that are not equal to those of free neutrons at the same energy .",
    "if angular momentum is not relevant in the reaction of interest ( a rare situation ) , the desired neutron - induced reaction can be extracted from the surrogate equivalent .",
    "( d , p ) reactions are not as simple as one might initially think because they involve at least three particles in the incoming and outgoing channels . assuming it can be treated as a three - body reaction",
    ", one may use the _ alt - grassberger - sandhas _",
    "( ags ) @xcite formalism to describe the reaction .",
    "the ags equations are a branch of the faddeev formalism to treat the @xmath122 system , and its rearrangements @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "the three - particle scattering in each channel is obtained from the transition operators @xmath125 , where @xmath126(@xmath127 ) corresponds to channel permutation combinations .",

    "the two - body transition operator @xmath133 for each interacting pair with inter - potential @xmath134 is determined from the lippmann - schwinger equation @xmath135 additional approximations are often necessary and the correct treatment of the coulomb interaction poses a major difficulty to solve the ags set of equations @xcite .",
    "one can treat the coulomb interaction with help of screened coulomb potentials , but this method works only for light nuclei since wild oscillations in the asymptotic region jeopardizes the accuracy of the solutions @xcite .",
    "in charge - exchange reactions , such as ( p , n ) reactions , one seeks information on gamow - teller matrix elements which can not be studied in @xmath127-decay experiments .",
    "the method is useful to obtain cross sections for inelastic neutrino scattering and electron capture reaction rates in stars . not only ( p , n ) , but ( @xmath136he , t ) and other charge exchange reactions at energies around 100 mev / nucleon have been used @xcite .",
