    "we wish to investigate whether localized burning can occur in the accreted atmosphere of a neutron star .",
    "a summary of the observations of type i x - ray bursts is presented by cumming ( 2002 ) in this proceedings .",
    "fryxell & woosley ( 1982 ) made some estimates of how fast a deflagration can travel through a fuel layer , considering multidimensional effects .",
    "we look to see whether it is possible to setup such a deflagration to begin with .",
    "given a temperature perturbation at the base of the fuel layer , a pressure gradient will result , which will act to smooth out this initial perturbation .",
    "this gradient will drive velocities which will spread out the initial perturbation .",
    "we want to determine whether it is possible for nuclear burning to act on a timescale that is faster than this spreading timescale .",
    "the nuclear rise time for a region of fuel is computed as @xmath0 if we can not burn faster than the spreading time of a perturbation , then the burning will not be localized .",
    "figure [ fig : nuc ] shows the nuclear timescales for several different densities of pure helium as a function of temperature , using the 3-@xmath1 reaction .",
    "we see that the fastest burning timescale is @xmath2s-this is long compared to the dynamical timescales that we consider in the next section .",
    "-0.25 in    we want how long it takes for two regions of fuel ( hot and cool ) to show differences  we want to compare the rates of the burning @xmath3 two regions of fuel that have nearly the same temperature will have very close nuclear rise times ( @xmath4 ) , so @xmath5 will be large ",
    "it takes a long time to see any differences .",
    "we can ignite locally if the time for the temperature perturbation to spread away is longer than @xmath6 . for each density",
    ", we need to find the initial conditions ( if they exist ) that result in a spreading time that is slower than this nuclear timescale .",
    "any temperature gradient on the grid will produce a pressure gradient , that will lead to a lateral acceleration .",
    "the acceleration laterally through the atmosphere can be integrated to yield an estimate for the spreading velocity , @xmath7 an initial 20% temperature perturbation is a @xmath8 pressure perturbation ( at a density of @xmath9 ) , which leads to a velocity of @xmath10 . if our initial perturbation is 1000 cm across , this would spread in @xmath11 .",
    "note that @xmath12 decreases as the material spreads , so this is the fastest case .",
    "rotation can have a stabilizing effect on the spreading of an initial perturbation ( spitkovsky , levin , & ushomirsky 2002 ) .",
    "there is a scale ( rossby deformation length ) at which the coriolis force will balance a pressure gradient : @xmath13 where f is the coriolis force and @xmath14 is the scale height .",
    "perturbations smaller than this scale will spread until they reach this length . for a 300 hz rotation speed ,",
    "this scale is about 10 km .",
    "this means that any temperature perturbation will spread out until it reaches 10 km .",
    "this allows us to define what we mean by non - rotation ",
    "the maximum size for @xmath15 is the circumference of the neutron star , so if the rotational frequency is less than @xmath16 , then rotation will not matter .",
    "this is the regime that we are considering presently .",
    "-0.25 in    the initial model we use to study the spreading of a perturbation through a neutron star atmosphere consists of a fuel and ash region , in hse vertically , and in lateral pressure equilibrium in the ash region .",
    "it is impossible to put an initial model in hse vertically and pressure equilibrium laterally if the temperatures at the bases differ .",
    "the initial conditions are created by computing separate initial models for each column of zones on the grid .",
    "the fuel is pure @xmath17he with a ( possible ) temperature perturbation at its base .",
    "the ash is pure @xmath18ni and completely isothermal .",
    "the model is completely specified by the ash temperature ( @xmath19 ) , the temperature and density at the base of the fuel layer , and the height of the interface .    for the present simulations , we choose the density at the base of the fuel layer to be @xmath9 .",
    "the temperature in the fuel region is specified by @xmath20 and @xmath21 is a constant multiplier ( we choose 0.9 , making it just sub - adiabatic ) .",
    "we pick an ash temperature of of @xmath22 .",
    "-0.25 in    the temperature at the base of the fuel layer is perturbed with a gaussian profile , @xmath23    we integrate the equation of hse outward from the fuel / ash interface using a second - order polynomial reconstruction for the zone - averaged density and a third - order reconstruction for the pressure : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the zone width , and @xmath26 represents the average value of the pressure in zone 0 .",
    "this reconstruction greatly suppresses any transients when an unperturbed model is evolved on our grid .",
    "figure [ 1d_models ] shows the vertical structure of the initial models at the maximally perturbed base temperature .",
    "each column of our computational domain is given a unique initial model , according to the fuel base temperature specified by eq .",
    "( [ eq : temp_perturb ] ) .",
    "the material up to the base of the fuel layer is in lateral pressure equilibrium .",
    "figure [ temp_init ] shows the temperature perturbation in the initial model ( with a peak temperature of @xmath27 ) we note that there is only a pressure gradient in the @xmath28 direction in the fuel layer .",
    "the calculations were performed with the flash code ( fryxell et al . 2000 ) , solving the euler equations with the piecewise - parabolic method ( ppm ) ( colella & woodward 1984 ) .",
    "cylindrical geometry ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 ) were used to exploit the axisymmetric symmetry of the problem .",
    "modifications to ppm were made to better evolve a hydrostatic atmosphere , and are discussed in zingale et al .",
    "we use a helmholtz free energy based tabular equation of state ( timmes & swesty 2000 ) , which allows for degenerate / relativistic electrons .",
    "no burning was used for these calculations  we only wish to determine the hydrodynamical effects .",
    "the accurate solution of the spreading problem requires us to extend the physics of the atmosphere into the boundary conditions . in the absence of any perturbations ,",
    "the euler equations reduce to the condition of hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "when the flow is hydrostatic , the boundary conditions are very influential .",
    "we use a hydrostatic boundary at the base of our model that provides pressure support to the material above it , while allowing sound waves to flow out .",
    "the material velocities are reflected in the boundary and the temperature is held constant .",
    "the density and pressure in the boundary are computed using the second - order zone - averaged differencing of hse eq.([eq : second_order_diff ] ) coupled with the eos ( see zingale et al .",
    "2002 ) .    at the upper boundary ,",
    "we extend the domain for several 10s of meters above the surface of the atmosphere , to allow for the differences in the pressure scale heights of the perturbed and unperturbed regions .",
    "the density of this material above the atmosphere is small so as not to be dynamically important .",
    "-0.25 in    we ran 3 different temperature perturbation simulations , 5% , 10% , and 20% ( corresponding to 1.6% , 3.2% , and 6.4% pressure perturbations ) .",
    "shortly after the simulation begins , a roll develops , with material comings towards the symmetry axis on the bottom , and flowing away on the top .",
    "this is shown in figure [ fig : vel ] for the 20% temperature perturbation . the maximum spreading velocity we find as a function of time",
    "is shown in figure [ vel_time ] .",
    "we see that , as expected , the spreading speed is greatest for the largest perturbation .",
    "it is difficult to determine from the data whether it follows the @xmath31 dependence that we estimated in  [ spread_timescale ]",
    "figure [ temp_time ] shows the maximum temperature on the grid as a function of time for the 3 runs .",
    "we expect the burning to be most vigorous at the peak temperature on the grid at any time , so this is in effect a measure of the nuclear timescales . recall that in all cases , the ambient temperature is @xmath32 .",
    "we see that in all cases , the temperature decreases very rapidly down to a level slightly higher than the background . in some instances",
    ", it even appears to increase slightly at long times ",
    "the reason for this is not known presently .",
    "the timescales of the decrease is @xmath33much faster than the nuclear timescale , and in agreement with our estimates in  [ spread_timescale ]",
    "all of these estimates are much faster than the burning timescale , so this perturbation is unlikely to result in localized ignition .",
    "we can try longer perturbations  but the maximum length is the circumference of the star .",
    "work is underway to generalize these results for different densities and perturbation sizes to determine whether a set of initial conditions exist under which we can locally burning the accreted fuel on a non - rotating neutron star .",
    "+ these simulations were carried out with flash 2.1 ( http://flash.uchicago.edu/ ) .",
