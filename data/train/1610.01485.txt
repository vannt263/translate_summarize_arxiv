    "the feedback - control method presented in this paper mimics the `` run - and - tumbling '' of _ escherichia coli _ but combined with active steering , thus it is a simple but more efficient method to transport microscopic swimmers under thermal fluctuations .",
    "the added ability of deterministic `` active '' reorientation achieves more efficient transportation of particle than the natural `` run - and - tumbling '' .",
    "it also has several advantages over other conventionally used micro - manipulation techniques : laser tweezers for example uses high power laser that could damage fragile samples and can be tricky to use as particles often jump out of the confining potential@xcite .",
    "+ we have also addressed the problem of optimizing the feedback and observed some interesting insights .",
    "the active reorientation decouples the abm and the reorientation process , in contrast to passive reorientation . due to this decoupling",
    ", we showed that the optimal acceptance angle is a function of @xmath14 .",
    "remarkably , since the timescale of passive reorientation is determined by @xmath15 , which scales in the cubic order of the radius , our method becomes particularly effective when the particles are relatively large .",
    "for instance in the case of a particle of diameter @xmath16 , @xmath17 in water whereas it can be as small as @xmath18 s in our experiments , as shown in fig .",
    "[ u0_omega ] , leading to more than 10 times enhancement of peclet number . for even smaller particles ,",
    "the gain of active reorientation becomes less significant as @xmath19 approaches @xmath20 , though the magnitude of @xmath20 is tunable by the applied electric field .",
    "+ although the optimal tolerance angle is determined by @xmath14 , our theory also predicts the robustness of the proposed algorithm .",
    "this is guaranteed by the fact that @xmath7 has a quite shallow shoulder towards large @xmath0 , at least for the range of parameters relevant to this experiment . in real world , individual particle may possess variable @xmath20 or experience an inhomogeneous @xmath19 from the environment .",
    "it may also be possible that the exact position of the target might not be known , or estimation of the orientation might not be precise , contributing to a poor resolution of @xmath21 .",
    "the final pclet number however , is weakly affected by these noises thanks to the broad tolerance of optimal @xmath0 . that allowed us to control the motion of particles in spite of the strong variability in their behavior .",
    "+ the key of our method lies in our finding of the peculiar rotational motion of janus particle that can be switched on and off by changing the parameters of the electric field .",
    "although the mechanism of this rotation is not yet fully understood , experimental measurements of @xmath20 showed that it was proportional to @xmath22 , implying that the torque @xmath23 as well as the force @xmath24 may originate from an asymmetric flow field around the particle generated by iceo .",
    "the other parameter , @xmath25 , has been poorly explored in the framework of icep .",
    "further experimental studies , as well as theoretical works , should be addressed .",
    "our results also suggested that geometrical factors such as chirality of the particle can play an critical role in determining the swimming behavior of the particle .",
    "an interesting challenge would be to find a way to artificially fabricate `` brahma particles '' , which as the hindu god would have four `` heads''@xcite .",
    "these swimmers would have two well - designed axis of asymmetry , one used to propel the particle and the other to induce `` switchable '' rotations .",
