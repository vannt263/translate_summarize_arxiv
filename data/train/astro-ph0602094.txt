    "the supernova remnant ( snr ) 1e0102.27219 ( hereafter e0102 ) is the brightest x - ray snr in the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) and was discovered with _ einstein _  @xcite . in x - rays , it has a ring - like appearance and its emission is dominated by h - like and he - like ions of o and ne .",
    "it consists of a bright x - ray ring and a much fainter plateau with a sharp outer edge that surrounds the ring ( fig.[images ] ) .",
    "this bright x - ray ring is caused by the reverse shock of the snr , while the outer boundary of the faint plateau marks the location of the blast wave .",
    "the diameter of the bright ring is @xmath6.03em28 , and the diameter of the outer rim is @xmath6.03em44 .",
    "the radio emission in the 6 cm wavelength band @xcite is located outside the bright x - ray emission but within the outer faint x - ray rim @xcite .    in the optical band",
    ", there is diffuse h@xmath1 emission surrounding the remnant , but a distinctive h@xmath1 ` hole ' at the location of the snr .",
    "a filamentary shell of optical [ oiii ] emission with a diameter of @xmath6.03em30  is seen @xcite , which is presumably emission from the ejecta .",
    "further outwards , the remnant is surrounded by a faint , diffuse , partial shell of [ oiii ] with a diameter of @xmath6.03em60  that is thought to be the result of photoionization by the precursor .",
    "emission lines of o , ne , c , and mg have been detected in the uv and optical spectra @xcite , but h , he , and fe are notably absent .",
    "@xcite estimated an age of @xmath6.03em1000  yrs for the remnant based on the optical diameter and the line of sight velocity range .",
    "based on abundance estimates from optical and uv data , @xcite suggested that the progenitor was possibly a massive o star that , after becoming a wolf - rayet star , exploded as a type ib supernova .",
    "more recently , @xcite argued that e0102 is the remnant of a type iil / b supernova with a progenitor that lost most of the h envelope before the explosion .",
    "we present new observations with the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _",
    "( _ fuse _ ) to study the ovi  emission in regions in the x - ray bright ring with differing distributions of [ oiii ] and x - rays .",
    "in addition , we analyze x - ray observations with _ xmm - newton _  and _ chandra _  and compare the o emission in the far - uv ( fuv ) to the x - ray emission .",
    "the _ fuse _  satellite was launched in june 1999 ; details of its operation and on - orbit performance are provided in the papers by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the _ fuse _  instruments cover the 905  1187    band with a nominal point source spectral resolution of @xmath7 .",
    "the _ fuse _  telescope has four optical channels , each with its own mirror and grating .",
    "two mirrors and gratings are coated with silicon carbide ( sic channels ) , and the other two mirrors and gratings are coated with al and a lithium fluoride overcoat ( lif channels ) .",
    "one sic / lif channel pair is sensed by one microchannel plate intensified detector , and the other channel pair is sensed by a second detector .",
    "the sic channels provide wavelength coverage from @xmath6.03em905    to 1100   , whereas the lif channels cover the wavelength range of @xmath6.03em1000    to 1187   .",
    "each of the two detectors is divided into two segments ( 1a and 1b , 2a and 2b ) , so that 8 spectra are obtained for each pointing ( lif1a / b , sic1a / b , lif2a / b , sic2a / b ) .    at the focal plane of each channel is an assembly holding three spectrograph apertures , dubbed lwrs , mdrs , and hirs . in time - tag data mode ,",
    "spectra through all three apertures are recorded simultaneously , but only one aperture is designated as primary .",
    "the primary science apertures for our program are the 4  @xmath8 20  mdrs apertures .    after launch",
    ", small thermally - induced distortions were discovered that cause misalignments of these apertures . while periodic alignment activities are performed to keep the channels approximately aligned ,",
    "motions of 3  8  occur on an orbital timescale ( @xmath6100 minutes ) , preventing detailed co - alignment during a given integration .",
    "the lif1 channel was used for guiding in the data presented here , so that the location of the source is fixed for this channel .",
    "due to the drift , not all the counts from the source fall on the detector .",
    "as this is not taken into account when the flux of the calibrated spectrum is computed , the flux of the sic and lif2 channels become lower than the real flux which is measured in the lif1 channel .",
    "the spectra of the sic and lif2 channels can be corrected by scaling the continuum flux to the correct continuum flux as determined in the lif1 spectrum .",
    "we observed three positions around the bright x - ray ring of e0102 .",
    "the positions were selected to have differing distributions of [ oiii ] in the optical and ovii , oviii  in the x - ray ( table [ obstab ] ) .",
    "the observations were scheduled at times where the aperture position angles could be tailored to the positions being observed .",
    "figure [ images ] shows the projected positions on a _ chandra _  image and on an _ hst _",
    "wfpc2 [ oiii ] image .",
    "the net _ fuse _  integration times are 12.4  ksec for the north pointing ( n ) , 15.6  ksec for the northeast pointing ( ne ) , and 8.2 + 5.2  ksec for the southeast pointing ( se , two visits ) .",
    "we also performed a dedicated off - source position with mdrs for estimating the background .",
    "however , the spectra from the background pointing show more significant contamination by background starlight than the on - source positions .",
    "therefore , the background observation has not been subtracted from the source spectra .",
    "the data have been processed by the calfuse 3.0 pipeline , and the resulting spectra are shown in figure [ fusespec ] .",
    "the only emission lines detected from the snr are the broadened ovi  doublet lines .",
    "we have modeled these spectra using functions available in idl and routines from an idl library including the fitting function mpfit.03emcraigm / idl / idl.html _ ] that performs least - squares curve fitting .",
    "line fluxes and derived surface brightnesses in ovi  are provided in table [ oneovi ] ( see sect.[ovidoublet ] for more details ) .",
    "there are numerous public archival x - ray data sets for e0102 obtained with _",
    "chandra _",
    "@xcite and _ xmm - newton_. we first considered using the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) data from the _ chandra _  archive .",
    "_ chandra _  data have far superior spatial resolution in comparison with _ xmm - newton_. however , we have determined that the brightest portions of e0102 as observed with the acis - s array in full frame mode are affected by pile - up , while the acis - s sub - array data and acis - i array data with the remnant on - axis have poor photon statistics .",
    "pile - up causes two or more photons to be detected as a single event . as the observed energy is the sum of the energies of two or more photons , the energy spectrum is thus distorted .",
    "compared to _",
    "chandra _",
    "observations , _ xmm - newton _  observations are less affected by pile - up due to shorter frame - times and lower spatial resolution ( thus smearing emission from bright sources over a larger region of the detector ) .",
    "_ xmm - newton _  is equipped with three european photon imaging cameras ( epic ) ; one is a pn - type ccd ( epic - pn ) and two are mos - type ccds ( epic - mos1/2 ) .",
    "both the acis and the epics are sensitive in the energy band of @xmath6.03em0.3  10.0  kev",
    ". for snrs , we are in general interested in soft x - rays ( @xmath9  kev ) .",
    "because the sensitivity of _ xmm - newton _  in the energy range of 0.5  2.0  kev is higher and the spectral resolution of epic - mos detectors is better than that of acis , we decided to use _ xmm - newton _  data primarily , except for the examination of the faint outer rim .",
    "the outer rim is much fainter than the bright ring and has much less pile - up .",
    "_ chandra _ s spatial resolution helps to isolate the rim emission from the bright ring emission .",
    "we selected archival data of three _ xmm - newton _  observations which were taken early in the mission ( april 2000 and april 2001 ) : obsids 0123110201 , 0123110301 , and 0135720601 .",
    "because we want to study the emission lines , we use epic - mos1 and mos2 data which have better spectral resolution than epic - pn .",
    "the net exposure times after removing times with soft proton flares are @xmath6.03em16  ks , 13  ks , and 20  ks for the observations 0123110201 , 0123110301 , 0135720601 , respectively .",
    "the data were obtained in small window mode resulting in a short frame time ( 0.3  s ; for comparison , frame time of the _ chandra _  acis full frame mode is 3.2  s ) and negligible pile - up .",
    "the data are processed with xmmsas 6.1.0 .",
    "we extracted spectra of the reverse shock at the positions of the _ fuse _   apertures ( fig.[xmmspec ] ) .",
    "the brightest lines in the x - ray spectra at these positions are the ovii  triplet lines and the oviii  ly@xmath1 line .",
    "although the diffuse ovi  emission lines are broad and faint , these line features are well detected in the _ fuse _  lif1a and lif2b spectra .",
    "the sic1a and sic2b spectra also cover the spectral range around the ovi  lines , however , the statistics of those data are poor due to the lower effective areas . also , the sic channels are more affected by the misalignment of the channels than the lif2b channel and the emission from the brighter parts of the remnant may have largely moved out of the aperture .",
    "we see significant ovi  emission in both lif1a and lif2b data .",
    "the rescaling of the lif2b spectra by effective area and continuum flux shows that the lif2b seems to have mainly covered the same ovi  emission as the guiding lif1a channel .",
    "therefore , we combine the lif1a and lif2b spectra for each pointing and analyze the co - added spectra around the ovi  lines ( 1020 to 1050 ) .",
    "the strongest emission lines in the spectra of the e0102 pointings are terrestrial airglow lines . in the wavelength band around the ovi  doublet @xmath01032 , 1038 ( 1031.926 , 1037.617 , respectively )",
    ", there is a strong hi  airglow line at 1025.7 , while the ovi  emission is relatively faint , in part because of the broadening of the lines .",
    "we use this hi  airglow line to calibrate the wavelength and to confirm that the spectral resolution is consistent with the aperture size . the ovi  doublet fluxes are derived by modeling the emission features between @xmath6.03em1030  and 1040 .",
    "interstellar absorption is significant in the far - uv and needs be taken into account when determining the line fluxes .",
    "we include absorption lines of  and cii and correct the flux for reddening through extinction .",
    "the  absorption has been derived using h2ools developed by @xcite . for the column density of  we use the milky way ( mw ) and smc values from @xcite ,",
    "i.e. , median values from 13 stars in the northern part of the smc .",
    "there is an evident absorption feature at @xmath6.03em1036  which is a cii  @xmath01036.3367 , 1037.0182 doublet .",
    "we model this feature as a line at @xmath6.03em1036   with free width .",
    "we also model absorption by ovi  along the line of sight , including both the mw and the smc components .",
    "we combine night and day data ( instead of using only night data to reduce the airglow emission ) because of the poor photon statistics .",
    "nevertheless , the sensitivity of _ fuse _  allows the broad oviemission lines from this faint diffuse source to be well detected ( see fig.[fusespec ] ) .",
    "the spectra are binned with 0.3   bins ( corresponding to @xmath6.03em87  km  s@xmath10 ) . using the fitting routine mpfit",
    ", we fit the ovi  @xmath01032 , 1038 lines with two broad gaussians , and the continuum is modeled as a constant .",
    "the widths of ovi  @xmath01032 , 1038 gaussian lines are tied together , and the relative positions of the lines are fixed to the wavelength separation : i.e.  we fit the ovi  @xmath111032 line ( free wavelength ) and tie the ovi  @xmath111038 line to the ovi  @xmath111032 wavelength + 5.691 .",
    "we also considered fitting each line with many zero - width gaussians which fill the observed width of the broad lines , to see if we can find different velocity components in the lines .",
    "the zero - width gaussians form pairs with fixed separation between the ovi  @xmath111032 and the ovi  @xmath111038 components . however",
    ", the fits did not improve significantly .",
    "the normalization of each line is a free parameter except for the n pointing data , which have much poorer statistics . in the case of the n data",
    ", the normalization of the @xmath111038 line is fixed at half of the @xmath111032 line normalization ( corresponding to the optically thin limit ) . from the line energy and width",
    ", we derive a velocity shift and fwhm .",
    "the flux is corrected for extinction , using the galactic extinction curve of @xcite and @xcite as well as extinction curves of the magellanic clouds from @xcite . to obtain the de - reddened flux , we use @xmath12 = 0.08 , assuming that the extinction is caused half by the smc and half by the mw , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "we compute the 90% confidence errors for the line energy , width , and flux .",
    "the fwhm , shifts , and fluxes are listed in table [ oneovi ] .",
    "figure [ fusespec ] shows the spectra around @xmath111036 with the fits overplotted and fit residuals .",
    "the ovi  emission is faintest in the n pointing and brightest in the se pointing . in both the ne and se pointings ,",
    "the fits show that the gas has a velocity dispersion of about 900  km  s@xmath10 , while the faint ovi  line feature in the n pointing spectrum has a fwhm of @xmath13  km  s@xmath10 .",
    "this is most likely not thermal line broadening , but instead indicates a velocity structure in the remnant ( see sect.[specresult ] ) .",
    "the rest smc velocity is @xmath6.03em165  km  s@xmath10 @xcite , so the broad ovi  emission lines are blue - shifted by @xmath6.03em100  km  s@xmath10 in the ne pointing and by @xmath6.03em330  km  s@xmath10 in the se pointing .",
    "however , in the n pointing , the broad ovi  emission line feature is red - shifted by @xmath6.03em220  km  s@xmath10 .",
    "this might indicate a non - symmetric expansion of the remnant .      to combine the x - ray data with the fuv data , we perform an x - ray emission line analysis using the h - like and he - like lines of o , ne , and mg",
    ". the x - ray spectra have been binned with a minimum of 20 counts per bin to allow the use of @xmath14 statistics .",
    "we fit the epic - mos1/2 spectra using the x - ray spectral fitting package xspec .",
    "the model consists of gaussian lines at the known line energies of o , ne , mg , and si ( i.e.   ovii  triplet at @xmath6.03em0.57  kev , oviii  ly@xmath1 at 0.654  kev , neix  triplet at @xmath6.03em0.91  kev , nex  ly@xmath1 at 1.022  kev , mgxi  triplet at @xmath6.03em1.34  kev , mgxii  ly@xmath1 at 1.473  kev , sixiii  triplet at @xmath6.03em1.84  kev , sixiv  ly@xmath1 at 2.006  kev ) , a continuum - only model using the astrophysical plasma emission code ( apec , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and line - of - sight absorption .",
    "the foreground absorption model consists of a component for the foreground mw absorption with a fixed  of @xmath15  @xmath16 and a component with smc abundances @xcite to be fit .",
    "all the ly@xmath1 lines are well fit with zero - width gaussians .",
    "the ccd resolution does not allow the components of the triplet lines ( ovii , neix , and mgxi ) to be resolved , but at least two zero - width gaussians are necessary to reproduce the line features .",
    "therefore , we fit the triplet emission with two gaussians at the energies of the forbidden and the resonance lines which are the two stronger lines and span the energy range of the triplet . the forbidden and the resonance lines are fit separately ,",
    "i.e. , their flux ratio is free in the fits , and the flux of the intercombination line is included in the fluxes of the fitted lines .",
    "we use the sum of the fluxes as the flux of the triplet .",
    "oxygen lines are the strongest lines in both the _ fuse _  and the _ xmm - newton _   spectra of e0102 .",
    "we compare line fluxes obtained from _ fuse _  ( ovi  doublet ) and epic - mos ( ovii  triplet and oviii  ly@xmath1 ) to line fluxes predicted by models .",
    "the observed line ratios are listed in table [ ratiotab ] . for the comparison with the observed lines , we use line fluxes computed with neiline , which evaluates line emissivities for an ionizing or recombining plasma .",
    "line fluxes are calculated by evolving the plasma at a given initial temperature for a given ionization timescale . as this calculation assumes a single ionization timescale for the plasma",
    ", we also model line fluxes using a plane - parallel shock model with a single temperature and a distribution of ionization timescales appropriate for a plane - parallel shock ( vpshock model in xspec ; see * ? ? ?",
    "we assume smc abundances for all elements except for o , ne , and mg for both models .",
    "for the elements o , ne , and mg with enhanced abundances we use the numbers obtained from the global fits of the x - ray spectrum ( see sect.[vneifit ] ) .    the diagrams in figure [ linediagn ] show the line ratios ovii  triplet / oviii  ly@xmath1 , ovi  doublet / ovii  triplet , and ovi  doublet / oviii  ly@xmath1 derived from _ fuse _  and _ xmm - newton _  spectra and the error estimates based on the 90% confidence intervals for the line fluxes as a function of the ionization timescale @xmath17 and temperature @xmath18 for the two models . in the vpshock model ,",
    "the parameter @xmath2 is the upper limit of the ionization timescale that has a distribution characteristic for a plasma shocked by a steady plane - parallel shock .",
    "for the three line ratios for o , we evaluate confidence regions for the ratios as a function of @xmath18 and @xmath2 .",
    "the lines in black show the ratio between ovii  and oviii  observed in x - rays ( ovii  triplet / oviii  ly@xmath1 ) .",
    "the cyan and orange lines compare ovi  in far - uv with ovii  and oviii  ( ovi  doublet / ovii  triplet and ovi  doublet / oviii  ly@xmath1 ) .",
    "the results show that in the case of the neiline model , the confidence regions for the ratios ovii  triplet / oviii  ly@xmath1 , ovi  doublet / ovii   triplet , and ovi  doublet / oviii  ly@xmath1 intersect , yielding a well - defined @xmath18 vs.  @xmath17 region for each aperture : for n , @xmath19  kev and @xmath20  s  @xmath4 , for ne , @xmath19  kev and @xmath21  s  @xmath4 , and for se , @xmath22  kev and @xmath23  s  @xmath4 . while the @xmath18-@xmath2 regions for ne and se overlap , the result for n indicates higher @xmath18 and lower @xmath2 .",
    "however , the diagrams for the plane - parallel shock model show no overlap between the confidence regions of the line ratios .",
    "we also computed and compared the line ratios of ovii  triplet / oviii  ly@xmath1 , neix  triplet / nex  ly@xmath1 , and mgxi  triplet / mgxii  ly@xmath1 to check whether different elements might indicate different plasma conditions .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ tripladiagn ] .",
    "as the diagrams show , for neiline , the confidence regions for o , ne , and mg have little overlap and there are no conditions where all three intersect .",
    "there seems to be no single set of temperatures and ionization timescales that simultaneously describes the o , ne , and mg ratios .",
    "this is consistent with previous results . in analyzing _",
    "asca _  data for e0102 , @xcite have found it necessary to introduce separate plasma components for each element .",
    "analysis of _ chandra _  high energy transmission grating spectrometer ( hetgs ) data has shown that the dispersed line emission images have different radii for lines of different elements , suggesting progressive ionization by the reverse shock propagating through the ejecta @xcite .",
    "another explanation for the lack of overlap between the ions is that the x - ray emission arises from a distribution of shocks with different velocities as suggested for snr 1987a by @xcite . in the case of a plane - parallel shock model ( vpshock )",
    "the three confidence regions overlap for @xmath24  kev and @xmath25  s  @xmath4 .",
    "however , when the ovi  line results from _ fuse _  are included , there is no region of common temperatures and ionization timescales which satisfies the o line ratios .",
    "this might be indicating that the bulk of the ovi  emission arises from a different location with different plasma conditions than the location from which the bulk of the ovii  and oviiiemission arises .",
    "to analyze the global x - ray spectra of the three regions , we first fit the spectra in xspec using the vnei model with nei version 2.0 for a plasma in non - equilibrium ionization ( nei ) with variable abundances .",
    "this model assumes a single ionization timescale for the emitting plasma and is a simplification compared to the plane - parallel shock model ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the nei version 2.0 models use a newer atomic database ( astrophysical plasma emission database , aped , * ?",
    "* ) than the versions 1.0 and 1.1 and reproduces more accurate line emissivities .",
    "however , they do not contain inner - shell processes .",
    "for the absorption we include two components : one component represents the foreground mw absorption with a fixed  of @xmath15  @xmath16 and the other represents the smc absorption . for each region ,",
    "the epic - mos1 and mos2 spectra for the three observations are fit simultaneously with a single model .",
    "although we fit the spectra with various sets of initial parameters , models with a single vnei component fail to fit the spectra adequately . in all cases ,",
    "the model predicts a lower flux than the observed spectrum next to the mgxi  triplet line feature , exactly where the mgxii  ly@xmath1 line would be expected .",
    "because the fits for the x - ray bright ring are dominated by the strong ovii , oviii , neix , and nex  lines , we conclude that the elements o , ne , and mg might not be ionized to the same extent , with mg being more highly excited than the other elements .",
    "we therefore try a model with additional vnei components to represent different plasma components .",
    "first , we include a component for the ism shocked by the blast wave : to estimate this component , we use _ chandra _  acis - s3 data ( obsids and ) and extract a spectrum in the x - ray plateau covering the outer blast wave , i.e.  a ring centered on ra = 01@xmath26  04@xmath27  02.0@xmath28  , dec = 72  01  53.2 with inner radius of 19  and outer radius of 23 .",
    "this emission is very faint and not affected by pile - up . in the _ xmm - newton_epic - mos1/2 data it is not possible to separate clearly the emission from the blast wave and the ejecta because of the poor spatial resolution of _ xmm - newton_. fitting the blast wave spectrum extracted from _",
    "chandra _  data with one vnei component ( absorption component as above ) ,",
    "we obtain : @xmath29  kev , @xmath30  s  @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , we fit the _ xmm - newton _  spectra of parts of the bright x - ray ring with a model including a vnei component for the ism with @xmath18 and @xmath2 fixed , and all the abundances set to the smc ism abundances @xcite . for the ejecta emission , we include two vnei components : a component for the emission dominated by o , fixing the parameters for @xmath18 and @xmath2 to the results from the line diagnostics ( see fig.[linediagn ] ) with all other element abundances set to zero , and a component accounting for the rest of the ejecta emission , consisting of ne and mg ( with abundances for the other elements set to zero ) , with free @xmath18 and @xmath2 . the same set of absorbing columns ( galactic and smc as described above ) is used for both components .",
    "the fits are better than with a single vnei model , and the fit parameters are listed in table [ xmmpar ] .",
    "the spectra of the obsid 0123110201 data and the best fit model , obtained by a simultaneous fit of all spectra of the three obsids , are shown in figure [ xmmspec ] .",
    "if the line broadening in the _ fuse _  spectra were due to thermal motion , the fwhm of about 900  km  s@xmath10 would correspond to an unreasonably high temperature of 3@xmath31  k. the analysis of the epic - mos data shows that the plasma temperature is about 10@xmath32  k. there are at least three scenarios that can explain this discrepancy .",
    "first , it is possible that the collisionless heating of the electrons behind the reverse shock front is negligible .",
    "@xcite argue that this is the case at the outer blast wave and that significant particle acceleration is required there . in such a case ,",
    "the oxygen ions , and thus also ovi , have a much high temperature than the electrons which are responsible for the x - ray emission .",
    "second , the electron temperature might have been underestimated by applying a single ionization timescale model ( vnei ) .",
    "third , the broadening might be caused by turbulence or by bulk motions rather than by thermal motions .",
    "@xcite derive expansion velocities of about @xmath331000  km  s@xmath10 from _ chandra _  hetgs data for the bright x - ray ring .",
    "the velocities measured from the hetgs data could be explained by geometric effects , if e0102 has , e.g. , a tilted , expanding ring geometry or a distorted shell with density variations .",
    "@xcite suggest that the difference in velocity shifts in different parts of the remnant might indicate that the southeastern part of the remnant shell is approaching and the northwestern part is receding .",
    "this is consistent with the velocity shifts obtained for the broad ovi  emission lines which show blue - shifts in the ne and se pointings , whereas the lines in the n pointing indicate a red - shift ( sect.[ovidoublet ] ) .",
    "the x - ray emission of the bright x - ray ring is mainly ejecta emission .",
    "because the spectra in all three regions are not well fit by a single component nei model , we have fit the spectra with two nei model components with variable abundances of o ( first component ) and ne and mg ( second component ) for the emission from the ejecta shocked by the reverse shock , and an additional nei model to account for the emission from the ism shocked by the blast wave .",
    "we calculate the unabsorbed flux ( 0.3  10.0  kev ) of the ejecta and shocked ism for each region and compare the flux fraction : the ratio between the surface brightness of the total ejecta emission and the ism emission , @xmath34 , is 6 , 3 , and 3 for regions",
    "n , ne , and se , respectively .",
    "the surface brightness of the ism component is @xmath35  erg  @xmath16  s@xmath10  arcsec@xmath36 in all three regions . for comparison , the surface brightness of the emission of the shocked ism in the outer rim is @xmath37  erg  @xmath16  s@xmath10  arcsec@xmath36 , in good agreement with the estimated ism component for the emission of the x - ray bright ring at the positions of the _ fuse _  pointings .",
    "the differences between the total flux of the three regions in the x - ray bright ring seem to be caused by differences in the emission from the ejecta shocked by the reverse shock as well as by variations in absorption as obtained from the spectral fits .",
    "the line ratio diagrams in figure [ linediagn]a show that the ovi   seen in fuv and the ovii  and ovii  x - ray emission are compatible with the assumption of an ionizing plasma with a single ionization timescale @xmath2 , as calculated by neiline . in this case , the line diagnostics of the o emission obtained with _ fuse _  and _",
    "xmm - newton _  show that the ionization timescale of the o gas differs in the three regions , increasing from n to se : @xmath38  s  @xmath4 in the n region , @xmath39  s  @xmath4 in the ne region , and @xmath40  s  @xmath4 in the se region .",
    "the temperatures in the three regions are comparable : @xmath18 = 0.3  0.5  kev .",
    "this result may indicate that the density in the ejecta is higher in the southeastern part of the x - ray bright ring , consistent with the optical data which show that the [ oiii ] emission is strongest in the se .",
    "if we instead assume a plane - parallel shock with a distribution of ionization timescales using the vpshock model , we do not obtain a consistent set of @xmath18 and the upper limit of @xmath2 for the ovi , ovii , and oviii   lines .",
    "however , the diagrams in figure [ tripladiagn]b indicate that the flux ratios of emission lines of o , ne , and mg in x - ray , and thus also ovii   and oviii , are consistent with a common temperature and ionization timescale assuming the plane - parallel shock model .",
    "as the diagrams in figure [ linediagn]b compare ovi  in fuv with the oxygen emission in x - ray , the fact that ovi , ovii , and oviii  show no overlap might suggest that the oxygen line emission in the fuv and the oxygen line emission in x - rays together are not consistent with the assumed model . as copious [ oiii ] emission is observed in the optical , there must also be denser shocked material and the ovi  emission might be related to it as well .",
    "therefore , multiple shocked plasmas or a range of velocities are possibly involved in the fuv and x - ray emission of e0102 .",
    "these results show that we find a few possible scenarios for the emission from this snr .",
    "however , as we are limited by the size of the aperture of _ fuse _  and the spatial resolution of _ xmm - newton _ we are not able to constrain whether the emission arises from a single shock or multiple shocks . moreover",
    ", the shock can be ionizing or recombining and thus radiative .",
    "although we have optical [ oiii ] images and x - ray images with ovii  and oviii  emission of high spatial resolution , we lack spatial information on ovi . if it were possible to obtain ovi  imaging data we would be able to compare the distribution of o in the remant and thus to determine if the shock is ionizing or recombining .",
    "furthermore , hydrodynamical models for reverse shocks are necessary to understand the distribution of elements as well as physical parameters like @xmath18 or @xmath2 in relatively young snrs like e0102 .",
    "to derive the ejecta mass , we numerically estimate the volume of the snr included in the slit , assuming that the snr emission is from a thick shell . the outer radius of the shell is assumed to coincide with the outer edge of the bright x - ray ring :",
    "@xmath41 = 160@xmath3310 = 4.7@xmath330.3  pc ( for @xmath42  kpc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; the inner radius of the bright x - ray ring is taken to be @xmath43 = 120@xmath3310 = 3.5@xmath330.3  pc .",
    "the resulting volume , @xmath44 , of the observed emitting gas is the intersection between this thick shell and a projected rectangle with the slit size ( @xmath45 4@xmath820  = 6.77  pc@xmath46  @xmath47 ) .",
    "the results are listed in table [ esttab ] .",
    "we assume an error of @xmath6.03em20% for the estimated volumes , as there are systematic uncertainties including the actual shape of the shell .",
    "the _ chandra _  hetgs spectra show that the plasma mainly consists of o , ne , and mg @xcite .",
    "the epic - mos fits also show that the ejecta emission results from o , ne , and mg .",
    "therefore , we assume a metal - rich plasma consisting of o , ne , and mg excited to h - like , he - like , or fully ionized states .",
    "the xspec vnei emissivity normalization ( table [ xmmpar ] ) is @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the distance to the source [ cm ] , @xmath50 is the hydrogen number density [ @xmath4 ] , and @xmath52 is the electron number density [ @xmath4 ] . in the case of a plasma with high overabundance of elements other than hydrogen , @xmath50 needs to be replaced by a reference density , @xmath53 , that is a sum over the number densities of the included elements , thereby taking the abundances into account .",
    "the electron density is @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the density of element i. the factor @xmath56 depends on the assumed mean charge state for each element ; we assume @xmath57 , for o , ne , and mg , respectively . assuming @xmath42",
    "kpc@xmath58  cm and uniform density in the thick shell , we estimate @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 for the two components for each region ( see table [ esttab ] ) .",
    "using these number densities , we obtain the o , ne , and mg mass for the entire remnant .",
    "we include a filling factor @xmath62 to account for the unknown volume fraction of the x - ray emitting plasma .",
    "the densities are proportional to @xmath63 .",
    "assuming a thick shell with an outer radius of @xmath41 = 4.7@xmath330.6  pc and an inner radius of @xmath43 = 3.5@xmath330.6  pc , we obtain @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 .",
    "if we assume a thick ring with @xmath67  @xmath4 as estimated by @xcite , we derive : @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath66 .",
    "we estimate a few @xmath70 in o , indicating a massive progenitor .    if we assume a volume fraction of unity , the oxygen mass @xmath71 is consistent with the result from _ chandra _  hetgs by @xcite who also assumed @xmath72 . by comparing their @xmath71",
    "estimate with the models of @xcite , @xcite suggest that the mass of the progenitor of e0102 was @xmath6.03em32  @xmath70 .",
    "@xcite compare abundance ratios based on optical and uv lines to values derived by @xcite and conclude that the e0102 progenitor is best described by a 25  @xmath70 model .",
    "our mass estimates for o and mg as well as the mass ratios agree well with the 25  30  @xmath70 model @xcite , while the ne mass estimate is slightly higher than the model prediction . even for a filling factor as low as @xmath73 ,",
    "the mass estimates are consistent with a massive progenitor @xcite .    in these calculations , there are still some uncertainties that we have to be aware of . as the reverse shock",
    "has not yet reached the center of the remnant , there is still unshocked material interior to the reverse shock . if the unshocked material has the same abundance distribution as the shocked material ( i.e. , well - mixed ejecta ) the ratios will not be much altered , but the estimated masses would be lower limits .",
    "furthermore , the ionization potential increases with the atomic number ; the shock might be strong enough to ionize o all the way up to the he - like and h - like stages , but not as efficient in ionizing mg .",
    "therefore , a part of mg could be in lower ionization stages and not emitting in x - rays . finally , assuming a too high volume filling factor can result in overestimating the total masses .",
    "numerical calculations have shown that the ejecta shocked by the reverse shock form thin layers that can be deformed by rayleigh - taylor instabilities , decreasing the fraction of the observed ejecta in the apertures @xcite .",
    "we have observed three regions in the bright x - ray ring of the o - rich snr 1e0102.27219 in the smc using the _ fuse _  mdrs ( 4@xmath820 ) aperture .",
    "these three regions cover parts of the remnant ring with varying distributions of [ oiii ] in the optical , and ovii  and oviii  in the x - ray .",
    "the ring is caused by the reverse shock propagating into the ejecta . in the northern region ( n ) , the _ fuse _  spectrum shows very faint but velocity broadened ovi  emission . in the northeastern ( ne ) and the southeastern ( se ) parts of the snr ring",
    ", there is significant ovi  emission with broad ovi@xmath01032 , 1038 lines , indicating a velocity dispersion of about 900  km  s@xmath10 .",
    "the emission from the se pointing appears to be blue - shifted by @xmath6.03em200  km  s@xmath10 relative to the emission from the ne pointing .",
    "we have also analyzed the _ xmm - newton _",
    "epic - mos1/2 spectra of e0102 in the same regions as in the _ fuse _",
    "observations . for the combined analysis of the fuv and x - ray data , we consider two cases : 1 .",
    "shocked plasma described by a single temperature and single ionization timescale ( using the models neiline and vnei ) and 2",
    ".   plane - parallel shock with a distribution of ionization timescales ( using the vpshock model ) . in the first case , combining ovi  doublet emission from _ fuse _  data with ovii  triplet and oviii  ly@xmath1 in epic - mos1/2 spectra yields @xmath74  kev and @xmath38  s  @xmath4 for the n region , @xmath74  kev and @xmath75  s  @xmath4 for the ne region , and @xmath76  kev and @xmath5  s  @xmath4 for the se region .",
    "the ionization timescales of the o gas seem to increase towards the south ( @xmath77 ) , suggesting a higher density in the south .",
    "the total epic - mos1/2 spectra are well fit with a three component non - equilibrium ionization model ; two vnei components are necessary to describe the ejecta emission ( one for the o plasma , one for ne + mg plasma ) and an additional vnei component is used to model the emission from the shocked ism .",
    "the temperature of the ne + mg component is higher ( @xmath78  kev ) than the o component .",
    "for the plane - parallel shock model , however , the observed ratios of ovi / ovii  and ovi / oviii  are not consistent with the ovii / oviii  ratio , in that there is not a common region of allowed temperatures and ionization timescales .",
    "when the triplet and ly@xmath1 ratios are considered for o , ne , and mg in the x - ray bandpass alone , the observed ratios do have significant overlap in temperature ( @xmath79 1.0  kev ) and ionization timescale ( @xmath80  s  @xmath4 ) .",
    "these results might indicate that the _ fuse _  and _ xmm - newton _  data are sampling multiple shocks with different conditions . to better understand these results in the future",
    ", we still require information on the spatial distribution of ovi  in fuv as well as hydrodynamic models describing the structure of the reverse shock .    from the x - ray emission , we estimate the mass of o , ne , and mg in the entire remnant . making the assumption that the remnant is a thick shell , we obtain @xmath81 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 .",
