    "a large collection of coupled oscillating components of different natural frequencies getting spontaneously synchronized to oscillate at a common frequency is a phenomenon commonly observed in a variety of biological and physical systems , e.g. , yeast cell suspensions @xcite , networks of pacemaker cells in the heart @xcite , groups of flashing fireflies @xcite , arrays of superconducting josephson junctions @xcite , and many others @xcite .",
    "the kuramoto model provides a simple setting to investigate the physics of synchronization @xcite .",

    "the oscillators are globally coupled with coupling strengths that are equal and independent of their spatial distribution .",

    "it is known that above a critical coupling strength @xmath10 , the stationary state that the system attains at long times is a synchronized state . for @xmath11 , however , there is no synchronization at long times , and each oscillator keeps running at its own natural frequency .    although the kuramoto model has been studied extensively in recent years , much less is known about the case in which the oscillators are coupled with a strength that is a function of their spatial distribution , e.g. , an inverse power law in the separation .",
    "such a form of interaction is relevant for many situations , for example , in the study of long - range synchrony in a network of coupled neurons @xcite or in modeling flashing fireflies where the intensity of light signals carrying information from one firefly to another falls off in the three - dimensional space as the inverse of square of the distance from the source .",
    "a simple modification of the kuramoto model ( [ timeevolution ] ) to include a power - law interaction is to consider a one - dimensional periodic lattice of @xmath12 sites , with each site containing one oscillator , and with the oscillators interacting with one another with a strength that decays as a power law of the separation along the lattice length @xcite .",

    "the unsynchronized state , uniform both in the phase @xmath38 and in the spatial coordinate @xmath34 , solves the continuity equation in the stationary state . by performing a linear stability analysis of such a state ,",
    "we show that when it is unstable , different spatial fourier modes of fluctuations have different stability thresholds beyond which they grow exponentially in time with different rates . however , numerical simulations show that at long times , all the non - zero fourier modes decay in time , while the zero mode ( the  mean - field \" mode ) grows in time and dominates the instability process , thereby driving the system to a synchronized state .",

    "<S> we study synchronization in a system of phase - only oscillators residing on the sites of a one - dimensional periodic lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the oscillators interact with a strength that decays as a power law of the separation along the lattice length and is normalized by a size - dependent constant . </S>",
    "<S> the exponent @xmath0 of the power law is taken in the range @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the oscillator frequency distribution is symmetric about its mean ( taken to be zero ) , and is non - increasing on @xmath2 . in the continuum limit </S>",
    "<S> , the local density of oscillators evolves in time following the continuity equation that expresses the conservation of the number of oscillators of each frequency under the dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> this equation admits as a stationary solution the unsynchronized state uniform both in phase and over the space of the lattice . </S>",
    "<S> we perform a linear stability analysis of this state to show that when it is unstable , different spatial fourier modes of fluctuations have different stability thresholds beyond which they grow exponentially in time with rates that depend on the fourier modes . </S>",
    "<S> however , numerical simulations show that at long times , all the non - zero fourier modes decay in time , while only the zero fourier mode ( i.e. , the  mean - field \" mode ) grows in time , thereby dominating the instability process and driving the system to a synchronized state . </S>",
    "<S> our theoretical analysis is supported by extensive numerical simulations .    </S>",
