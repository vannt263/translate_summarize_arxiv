    "the nature of extremely red objects ( eros ) remains an open question in understanding the faint galaxy population at @xmath2 .",
    "first identified by elston et al .",
    "( 1988 ) , the identity of these objects , defined by their extreme optical / ir colors ( @xmath3 ) , has proven elusive due to the optical faintness of the population .",
    "the few eros with spectroscopic redshifts form a motley @xmath4 collection , including both ultraluminous dusty star - forming galaxies like hr  10 ( graham & dey 1996 ; dey et al.1999 ) and passively - evolving luminous ellipticals like lbds  53w091 ( dunlop et al .",
    "both of these types of systems are of great utility in learning about the formation of galaxies and clusters of galaxies .",
    "we are conducting an on - going study of eros , using ground - based optical and near - ir imaging to assemble large samples amenable to statistical studies and keck optical / near - ir spectroscopy to determine redshifts and physical properties . deciphering",
    "the identity of eros from broad - band colors alone is ambiguous  spectroscopy is essential .",
    "in addition , given the population s apparent heterogeneity , a reasonably large sample of objects needs to be studied to understand the nature and relative abundances of the subsets , instead of the spectroscopy of individual eros which has been done to date .",
    "we have discovered a concentration of eros in the field of qso  12130017 , a quasar at @xmath5 . in this proceedings , we highlight some of our results . the complete analysis and its details are presented in liu et al .",
    "figure [ twopanel ] shows optical and ir images obtained from kpno of the 12130017 field .",
    "a population of objects with red ( @xmath6 ) colors are seen , with the brightest ones being @xmath7 .",
    "these are as red as the expected appearance of @xmath4 passively evolving ellipticals .",
    "most of the sources are resolved in hst @xmath8 imaging so they are certainly galaxies and not m  stars .",
    "we also have @xmath9 and @xmath10-band images for a subset of the galaxies ; their optical / ir colors are also consistent with @xmath0 ellipticals ( liu et al .",
    "1999 ) .    to gauge the significance of these red galaxies , we compare with field ero counts of thompson et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . after accounting for the difference between our @xmath11 filter ( @xmath12   ) and the @xmath13 filter of thompson et al .",
    "( @xmath14   ) , we find 4 galaxies with @xmath15 and @xmath16 in the deepest 6.2  arcmin@xmath17 of our images .",
    "compared to the 0.24 objects expected from the field counts , this is a factor of @xmath1815 excess , with a factor of 6 being the 95% confidence value .    0.45 in",
    "we identified spectroscopic features for 5 of the red galaxies ( table  [ table - spectra ] ) .",
    "two of them are emission line galaxies .",
    "galaxy r6 shows a single narrow emission line which we identify as [ o  ii ] at @xmath19 .",
    "the spectrum of r7 reveals the presence of an active galactic nucleus , showing strong lines of [ o  ii ] and c  ii ] with intrinsic widths of @xmath181800  km  s@xmath20 .",
    "the other 3 red galaxies are devoid of strong emission lines , but they do show continuum breaks identifiable as the rest - frame mid - uv breaks at 2640    and 2900    ( figure  [ absrestframe ] ) .",
    "at least two of the red galaxies may also have mg  ii in absorption .",
    "the uv break features are characteristic of the oldest stellar populations , such as galactic and m31 globular clusters and the cores of local elliptical galaxies .",
    "they have also been identified in high - redshift ellipticals , e.g. , lbds  53w091 at @xmath21 . for old stellar populations , this spectral region",
    "is expected to be dominated by light from stars near the main sequence turnoff so , in principal , the strengths of these features can be used to infer the age of the population  at least the portion emitting the bulk of the mid - uv flux  by basically measuring the turnoff mass ( e.g. , spinrad et al .",
    "we do not attempt this , but we do point out that real variations exist in the uv colors and spectral break amplitudes of r1 , r8 , and r10 , suggesting heterogeneous stellar populations and star formation histories even though they are at a common location in the universe and have similar @xmath22-band luminosities .",
    ".spectroscopic redshifts in the 12130017 field [ cols=\"<,^,^,<,^ , < \" , ]     -0.4 in",
    "we have found a significant excess of eros in this field , and of the 5 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts , 4 lie close together . moreover , the spectrum of qso  12130017 shows mg  ii absorption at @xmath24 , similar to r7 s redshift .",
    "it is unlikely that r7 is the absorber as it is 15from the qso ( 65  @xmath25  kpc for @xmath26 ) , too large compared to expected sizes of absorbers ( steidel 1993 ) .",
    "in addition , our hst images show some faint galaxies closer to the qso , making them better candidates for the absorber .",
    "we therefore have a total of 5 galaxies close in redshift and within @xmath27  mpc on the sky .",
    "their unweighted mean redshift is 1.309 with a standard deviation of @xmath28  km  s@xmath20 and a full range of 3800  km  s@xmath20 in the mean rest frame .",
    "this is the highest redshift concentration of old , red galaxies published to date which has been spectroscopically confirmed .",
    "further data are needed to gauge if this is a genuine massive cluster , both x - ray images to search for hot intracluster gas in a deep potential and more redshifts to ascertain the velocity distribution . finally , we point out that galaxies r8 and r10 lie at @xmath29 while the other 3 are at @xmath30 , i.e. , there is a `` gap '' of 2500  km  s@xmath20 in the mean rest frame , though there is no clear segregation on the sky",
    ". these may be two separate physical entities ( e.g. , filaments / sheets / sub - clusters ) , but this speculation lies beyond the available data ."
