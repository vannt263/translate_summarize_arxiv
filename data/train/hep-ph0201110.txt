    "the gauge interaction properties of the standard model ( sm ) have been measured quite precisely in the last decade .",
    "however , the higgs particle has not yet been discovered in spite of much effort .",
    "the physics behind the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) and the origin of masses of quarks and leptons are left as unresolved problems .",
    "the idea of the top quark condensate  @xcite , in which the 4-top - quark interaction is introduced to trigger the ewsb , explains naturally the large mass of the top quark at the ewsb scale .",
    "( see also the earlier attempt  @xcite . )",
    "this model is often called the `` top mode standard model '' ( tmsm ) , because the scalar bound state of @xmath16 plays the role of the higgs boson in the sm .",
    "it is known that the original version of the tmsm has some difficulties : the top quark mass @xmath17 is predicted about 10%30% larger than the experimental value ( @xmath18 gev ) , even if we take the ultraviolet cutoff ( or the compositeness scale ) to the planck or the gut scale  @xcite .",
    "in addition , such a huge cutoff causes a serious fine - tuning problem . in topcolor models ( tcms )",

    "@xcite if we assume that the coloron mass @xmath4 is @xmath19 , we need not tune the coupling of the 4-top - quark finely to its critical value . although the mass generated by the dynamics of colorons ( the dynamical mass @xmath5 ) becomes quite large , typically @xmath20 tev , in tcms where only the top - condensate is responsible for the ewsb , the problem @xmath21 can be resolved in some classes of models such as topcolor assisted technicolor models ( tc2 )  @xcite and top - seesaw ( tss ) models  @xcite . in tc2",
    ", we introduce techni - fermions in addition to colorons .",
    "we assume that the topcolor interaction is responsible for the top - quark mass , while the ewsb occurs mainly due to technicolor interactions .",
    "namely , the dynamical mass itself is adjusted to @xmath22 with a small vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the top quark condensate @xmath23 , where @xmath24 denotes the ewsb scale .",
    "the top - yukawa coupling in tc2 is about @xmath25 times larger than the value in the sm .",
    "this enhancement of the top - yukawa is quite important to the higgs boson production via the gluon fusion process . in tss models ,",
    "we introduce a vector - like heavy colored fermion @xmath26 , whose mass term has nothing to do with the ewsb , in order to have a seesaw - type mass matrix .",
    "the dynamical mass @xmath5 in tss models does not correspond to the mass eigenvalue of the top - quark .",
    "the experimental value @xmath22 is obtained after diagonalization of the mass matrix for the top - quark via the seesaw mechanism .",
    "namely , the large dynamical mass of the order of 0.6 tev can be realized in tss models consistently with @xmath22 . here ,",
    "we note that the mixing between @xmath27 and @xmath28 is severely constrained from the custodial symmetry violation , i.e. the @xmath29-parameter , which usually requires @xmath26 to have a mass of the order of several - tev . although the tmsm with extra dimensions proposed by arkani - hamed et al .",
    "@xcite is also a candidate to resolve the fine - tuning problem etc . , it is a pure bulk gauge theory without 4-fermion interactions in the bulk rather than a tcm  @xcite .",
    "the phenomenology of the tmsm with extra dimensions will be studied elsewhere  @xcite .    in this paper , we study the production of the higgs boson in tcms .",
    "we regard the higgs boson as the tightly bound state of @xmath16 ( or @xmath30 ) and do not consider direct signatures of other bound states .",
    "the higgs boson can be searched for at the tevatron  @xcite or at the lhc  @xcite . in the sm ,",
    "the leading contribution to the higgs boson production at hadron colliders comes from the gluon fusion process via loops of heavy quarks  @xcite .",
    "the gluon fusion process is thus sensitive to the top - yukawa coupling and the number of heavy quarks .",
    "in addition , it is possible that extensions to qcd affect the gluon fusion process .",
    "especially , colorons are strongly coupled to the top quark , and the dynamical mass @xmath5 is very large for tcms with a single vev triggering the ewsb , so that the effect of colorons can be expected to be sizable . in order to evaluate roughly the size of the contribution of colorons",
    ", we first derive the low - energy effective theory by eliminating colorons by using the equation of motion ( eom ) for colorons .",
    "we then find that the effective gluon - gluon - higgs- ( @xmath1- ) operator is induced in the low - energy effective theory and that the coefficient is proportional to @xmath3 .",
    "in the situation of @xmath31 and @xmath8 , the contribution of colorons becomes comparable to the top - loop effect .",
    "next , we estimate quantitatively the size of the effective @xmath1-coupling including the contributions of the top - quark loop , other heavy - quark loops , and colorons in tss models and tc2 . we find that the contribution of colorons can be sizable in tss models with the coloron mass @xmath7 and the mass of @xmath26 , @xmath32 , and that the effect of the top - loop is almost same as in the sm .",
    "we estimate numerically the effects of colorons and the top - loop as @xmath33 \\times 10^{-2 }   ( \\rm tev^{-1})$ ] and @xmath34 \\times 10^{-2 }   ( \\rm tev^{-1})$ ] for @xmath35 tev , respectively .",

    "we also note that the @xmath10 amplitude has the imaginary part above the threshold of the top - pair production ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "the gluon fusion process is obviously sensitive to the top - yukawa coupling and the number of heavy quarks . in this paper",

    "we hence classify nonstandard contributions to the @xmath10 amplitude into three categories :    ( a ) : :    _ loop effects of the top quark ; _ +    in the sm , the lowest order amplitude for the gluon fusion arises from    the triangle diagram of the top quark . on the other hand",
