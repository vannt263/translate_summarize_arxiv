    "wind energy is a ubiquitous resource and is a promising alternative to meet the increased demand for energy in recent years . unlike traditional power plants ,",
    "wind generated power is subject to fluctuations due to the intermittent nature of wind .",
    "the irregular waxing and waning of wind can lead to significant mechanical stress on the gear boxes and result in substantial voltage swings at the terminals , @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is important to build suitable mathematical techniques to understand the temporal behavior and dynamics of wind speed for purposes of modeling , prediction , simulation and design . attempts to identify the features of wind speed time series data were described in @xcite and @xcite . to our knowledge ,",
    "the first paper to bring out an important feature of wind speed time series was @xcite .",
    "in @xcite , the authors examined long term records of hourly wind speeds in ireland and pointed out that they exhibited what is known as _ long memory dependence_. seasonal effects , spatial correlations and temporal dependencies were incorporated to build suitable estimators .",
    "trends in long term wind speed records were also suggested in @xcite .",
    "however , in @xcite , short memory temporal correlations were suggested by an examination of the autocorrelation function .",
    "evidence for the presence of long memory correlations was provided by inspecting the periodogram of the residuals from a fitted and autoregressive model of order nine i.e. ar(9 ) , @xcite .",
    "+ in this paper , we provide a systematic method to identify , more importantly quantify the index of long range correlations in wind speed time series data .",
    "we make use of a fairly robust and powerful technique called _ detrended fluctuation analysis _ ( dfa ) in our analysis , @xcite . the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sec.2 ,",
    "the acquisition of wind speed data is described . in sec.3 , traditional analysis of the hourly wind speed using power spectral techniques and hurst estimators",
    "is discussed along with some of their limitations . detrended fluctuation analysis ( dfa )",
    "is used to capture the crossover phenomena in wind speed .",
    "finally , the conclusions are summarized in sec .",
    "in this section , we provide a brief description of the wind speed data acquisition system .",
    "the wind speeds at three different wind monitoring stations in north dakota are recorded by means of conventional cup type anemometers located at a height of 20 m. wind speeds acquired every two seconds are averaged over a 10 minute interval to compute the 10 minute average wind speed .",
    "the 10 minute average wind speeds are further averaged over a period of one hour to obtain the hourly average wind speed . in this procedure , the computed hourly average wind speed is simply equivalent to averaging the observations every two seconds for one hour .",
    "the hourly average wind speeds are preferred over the 10 minute speeds to minimize storage requirements for several years of data .",
    "the site details of the monitoring stations are provided in table 1 . in our analysis",
    ", we consider a period from 11/29/2001 to 03/28/2003 for the wind speed records .",
    "fig.[wspd ] shows the wind speed ( @xmath4 in @xmath5 ) variability at the three locations .",
    "the aim of the present study is to characterize and quantify the apparently irregular fluctuations of the wind speed in fig.[wspd ] . in the following section ,",
    "the analysis of wind speed data using three different techniques is provided .",
    "[ tab1 ]    .",
    "station locations [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     from table 3 , we note that the choice of linear detrending ( dfa1 , i.e. @xmath6 ) yields estimates of @xmath7 consistently at all three locations . whereas , higher order detrendings ( @xmath8 ) indicate an exponent @xmath9 consistently at all three locations which suggests a possible @xmath10 type behavior . for the surrogate data sets ( @xmath11 ) in table 3 , we note that all four choices of detrending yield exponents very close to @xmath12 at all three locations which shows that scaling in the original data is an outcome of the correlations present in it and not due to its distribution .",
    "+ we further note from figs .",
    "[ dfa_alp01 ] , [ dfa_alp03 ] and [ dfa_alp05 ] that unlike the surrogates , the log - log plot of the original data sets at all three locations is not linear . for low orders of detrending @xmath13 , the slope of the fluctuation functions of the original data set gradually changes as seen in figs [ dfa_alp01 ] , [ dfa_alp03 ] and [ dfa_alp05 ] .",
    "however , for @xmath14 ( fourth order detrending ) , the transition of slope is comparatively abrupt in the fluctuation function around @xmath15 which suggests the existence of more than one scaling exponent . in this case , the global scaling exponent shown in table 3 is insufficient to capture the change in scaling exponent .",
    "therefore , the scaling region is partitioned in to two regions around @xmath16 . in the region",
    "@xmath17 , the slope of the fluctuation function is given by @xmath18 and in the region @xmath19 , the slope is given by @xmath20 .",
    "these represent what we call  local scaling exponents \" .",
    "thus , the  crossover \" from one scaling exponent ( @xmath18 ) to the other ( @xmath20 ) is seen to occur at approximately at a time scale @xmath21 hours .",
    "the local scaling exponents @xmath22 estimated by dfa for these two regions , using different order polynomial detrending for the three data sets are summarized in table 4 . as a comment",
    ", we would like to mention that such intricacies are not evident from the power spectrum , fig .",
    "[ prelim_figs ] and hurst analysis ( sec 3.2 ) .",
    "+ recall from sec .",
    "[ hurst ] that while some of the methods ( variance method , r / s and absolute moments ) yielded exponent estimates in the range ( 0.6 - 0.8 ) , the abry - veicht method produced an estimate close to 1.4 . on the other hand , dfa in addition to identifying the exponents also helps in demarcating the regions ( time scales in the signal ) where these exponents are contained .",
    "+ from table 4 , we note that dfa1 yields an exponent @xmath18 close to 1.2 whereas dfa2,3,4 yield exponents close to 1.45 at all three locations . for the exponent @xmath20",
    ", we note that while dfa1 yields estimates close to 0.6 , dfa2,3,4 yield exponents close to 0.7 .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to say that the original signal possesses _ at least _ two scaling exponents over two time scales . at short time scales ( @xmath23 hours ) , the data exhibits behavior similar to brown noise @xmath24 , whereas for longer time scales @xmath25 hours ) one observes persistent long - range correlations @xmath26 .",
    "interestingly , the results obtained across the data obtained from different geographical locations seem to exhibit a similar behavior .",
    "long term records of hourly average wind speeds at three different wind monitoring stations in north dakota are examined .",
    "preliminary spectral analysis of the data indicates that wind speed time series contain long range power - law correlations .",
    "analysis using hurst estimators were inconclusive .",
    "a detailed examination using _ dfa _ indicated a crossover and revealed the existence of _ at least _ two distinct scaling exponents over two time scales .",
    "while the data resembled brownian noise over short time scales , persistent long range correlations were identified over longer time scales .",
    "the scaling behavior was consistent across the three locations and were verified using different orders of polynomial trending .",
    "it is interesting to note that despite the inherent heterogeneity across spatially separated locations , certain quantitative features of the wind speed are retained .",
    "while several factors including friction , topography and surface heating are known to contribute towards wind speed variability , the present report seems to indicate that the combined effect of these factors may themselves be subject to variability over different time scales . a possible explanation for the crossover may be that on short time scales ( tens of hours ) , the fluctuations in wind speed may be dominated by atmospheric phenomena governed by the ",
    "local or regional \" weather system whereas on longer time scales ( extending from several days to months ) , the fluctuations may be influenced by more general  global \" weather patterns .",
    "while the present study indicates two distinct scaling exponents , a closer inspection of longer records of wind speed at finer resolutions may possibly reveal a spectrum of scaling exponents characteristic of multifractals . however , this is more of a conjecture at this point .",
    "we plan to investigate this in greater detail in subsequent studies .",
    "we thank the reviewers for their constructive comments and useful suggestions which have helped us enhance the quality of the manuscript .",
