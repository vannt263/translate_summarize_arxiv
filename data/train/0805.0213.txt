    "the polarizabilities of a composite system such as the pion are elementary structure constants , just as its size and shape .",
    "they can be studied by applying electromagnetic fields to the system .",
    "the physical content of the polarizability can be visualized best by effective multipole interactions for the coupling of the electric @xmath0 and magnetic @xmath1 fields of a photon with the internal structure of the pion .",
    "this structure can be accessed experimentally by the compton scattering process @xmath2 or the crossed - channel reaction @xmath3 . when expanding the compton scattering amplitude in the energy of the photon , the zeroth- and first - order terms follow from a low - energy theorem and can be expressed solely in terms of the charge and mass of the pion .",
    "the second - order terms in the photon energy describe the response of the pion s internal structure to an external electric or magnetic dipole field , they are proportional to the electric ( @xmath4 and magnetic ( @xmath5 ) dipole polarizabilities , respectively . expanding the compton amplitudes to higher orders in the energy , one obtains higher - order polarizabilities , e.g. , the quadrupole polarizabilities at fourth order .",
    "+ from the theoretical side there is an extraordinary interest in a precise determination of the pion polarizabilities . within the framework of the partially conserved axial - vector current ( pcac ) hypothesis and current algebra the electromagnetic polarizabilities of the charged pion",
    "are related to the radiative decay @xmath6",
    "the result obtained using chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) at leading non - trivial order ( @xmath7 )  @xcite is equivalent to the original pcac result , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is a linear combination of scale - independent parameters of the gasser and leutwyler lagrangian  @xcite . at @xmath7",
    "this difference is related to the ratio @xmath10 of the pion axial - vector form factor @xmath11 and the vector form factor @xmath12 of radiative pion beta decay  @xcite , @xmath13 .",
    "once this ratio is known , chiral symmetry makes an _ absolute _",
    "prediction for the polarizabilities . using the most recent determination @xmath14 by the pibeta collaboration  @xcite ( assuming @xmath15 obtained from the conserved vector current hypothesis ) results in the @xmath7 prediction @xmath16 in units of @xmath17 , where the estimate of the error is only the one due to the error of @xmath18 and does not include effects from higher orders in the quark mass expansion .",
    "+ corrections to the leading - order pcac result have been calculated at @xmath19 in chiral perturbation theory and turn out to be rather small  @xcite .",
    "contrary to the situation of the nucleon , no `` matter fields '' with their own mass scale are present , and therefore the calculations can be performed in the original formulation of chpt  @xcite .",
    "this makes the following predictions for the polarizabilities a very significant test of this theory  @xcite : @xmath20 the error for @xmath21 is of the order 0.1 , mostly from the dependence on the scale at which the @xmath19 low - energy coupling constants are estimated by resonance saturation .",
    "the forward polarizability could also obtain relatively large contributions at @xmath22 . on the other hand , there is as yet no indication of large higher - order effects for the backward polarizability @xmath23 .",
    "for further information on low - energy @xmath24 reactions we refer to the recent review by kaiser and friedrich  @xcite .",
    "+ the pion polarizability has been studied in lattice qcd  @xcite . the valence - quark contribution to the electric polarizability",
    "was shown to yield only the small value @xmath25 , one order of magnitude smaller than the value predicted by chpt .",
    "it is , of course , not surprising that sea quarks and their correlations must play an important role , most likely configurations with the quantum numbers of the pion . in a recent contribution , hu  _ et al . _ also conclude that polarizabilities are difficult to predict in lattice qcd because of ( partial ) quenching and volume effects  @xcite . however , these authors point out that forthcoming lattice qcd results can be used as a diagnostic for chpt",
    ". + the results of chpt are in sharp contrast with the predictions of filkov and kashevarov  @xcite who obtain @xmath26 in recent work  @xcite based on dispersion relations ( drs ) .",
    "the dispersion integrals are saturated by various meson contributions in the @xmath27 and @xmath28 channel .",
    "the free parameters are essentially fixed by the known masses , total widths , and partial decay widths of these mesons at resonance .",
    "however , the extrapolation to energies below and above the resonance is performed with specific resonance shapes whose analytic properties leave room for a considerable model dependence . + the very small value predicted by eq .",
    "( [ eq:1.1 ] ) , that is baldin s sum rule applied to the pion , makes a measurement of this observable close to impossible .",
    "the experiments are therefore analyzed with the constraint @xmath29 .",
    "unfortunately , the experimental situation is rather contradictory , see refs .",
    "@xcite for recent reviews of the data and further references to the experiments .",
    "there exist basically three different methods to measure @xmath30 : ( i ) the reactions @xmath31 , ( ii ) the primakov effect of scattering a relativistic pion in the coulomb field of a heavy nucleus , and ( iii ) the radiative pion photoproduction , @xmath32 , which contains compton scattering on an off - shell pion as a subprocess .",
    "the latter reaction was recently investigated at the mainz microtron mami with the result  @xcite @xmath33 which is at variance with the prediction of gasser _ et al . _",
    "@xcite by two standard deviations . in view of the theoretical uncertainties from the fact that the photon is scattered by an off - shell pion",
    ", the deviation from theory is an open problem . in particular , we point out that the model error in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1.3 ] ) is estimated by comparing the analysis with 2 specific models .",
    "this does not exclude that a wider range of models will lead to larger model errors . because the pion polarizability is extremely important for our understanding of qcd in the confinement region , it is prerequisite to check the given arguments by a full - fledged chpt calculation of the reaction @xmath34 .",
    "+ the second method to determine the polarizability , the primakov effect , has been studied at serpukhov with the result  @xcite @xmath35 in agreement with the value from mami .",
    "recently , also the compass collaboration at cern has investigated this reaction , and the data analysis is underway  @xcite .",
    "+ unfortunately , the third method based on the reactions @xmath36 , has led to even more contradictory results in the range @xmath37 , as listed in the work of gasser _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "therefore , one has to wait for an improved analysis of the data before final conclusions can be drawn . at the same time",
    "new and independent experimental effort is invaluable , such as the planned experiment at jefferson lab after the 12  gev upgrade .",
    "+ in this work we address the conflicting results obtained by chpt and drs .",

    "let us consider the kinematics of compton scattering , the reaction @xmath38 , where the variables in brackets denote the 4-momenta of the participating particles .",
    "the familiar mandelstam variables are @xmath39 which are constrained by @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the pion mass .",
    "the crossing - symmetric variable @xmath42 is defined by @xmath43 the two lorentz - invariant variables @xmath42 and @xmath28 span the mandelstam plane shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : mandelstam ] .",
    "they are related to the initial ( @xmath44 ) and final ( @xmath45 ) photon lab energies and to the lab scattering angle @xmath46 by @xmath47 the scattering matrix of compton scattering on the pion , @xmath48 , can be expressed by 2 independent amplitudes @xmath49 , @xmath50 .",
    "these structure functions depend on @xmath42 and @xmath28 , they are free of kinematic singularities and constraints , and because of the crossing symmetry they satisfy the relation @xmath51 .",
    "we further note that the functions @xmath52 are real in the interior of a triangle formed by the dashed lines @xmath53 in fig .",
    "[ fig : mandelstam ] . in the following we use these amplitudes to set up drs .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath52 are related to the amplitudes @xmath54 of prange  @xcite as follows : @xmath55 with @xmath56 . in terms of these amplitudes ,",
    "the @xmath48 matrix takes the form @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the photon polarization four - vectors in the initial and final states , respectively .",
    "furthermore we have defined the following 4-vectors @xmath60 with @xmath61 .",
    "the differential cross section for compton scattering is constructed from the @xmath48 matrix by @xmath62 where latexmath:[\\ ] ] figure  [ fig : tot(pi+pi-)_vm ] displays the total @xmath232 cross section given by the subtracted drs of eq .",
    "( [ eq : swave_sub ] ) with subtraction constants fixed by chpt and the model of ref .",

    "( [ eq : swave_uns ] ) .",
    "we note that all the results are obtained with an energy - independent coupling constant @xmath233 .",
    "the same results are shown over a larger energy region in fig .",
    "[ fig : tot(pi+pi-)_vmf2 ] .",
    "the @xmath217 resonance contribution is clearly visible near @xmath234  gev .",
    "however , the contribution of this resonance to the polarizability is very small , as has been noted before .",
    "+ the corresponding results for the @xmath235 cross section are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tot(pi0pi0)_vm ] . for this reaction",
    "the differences among the models are much more pronounced , and at energies above the @xmath217 resonance the discussed method fails completely , most likely because of the inelasticities due to more - pion and heavier systems . in order to highlight the importance of the vector mesons , fig .",
    "[ fig : tot(pi0pi0 ) ] presents the results of the previous figure without the vector - meson contributions .",
    "a correct unitarization of the full amplitude will be required in order to describe the higher - energy region .",
    "such a more consistent treatment has been developed , for instance , in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "the large model dependency for the neutral pion channel has also been observed in the recent work of oller and roca  @xcite . finally , we present our predictions for @xmath223 in table  [ table6bis ] , as obtained from unsubtracted drs .",
    "the value for the charged pion is in excellent agreement with chpt , whereas we fail to get close to the chpt prediction for the neutral pion . in view of the previous figures ,",
    "this result is not too surprising .",
    "whereas our unitarized amplitude describes the @xmath236 cross section quite well up to energies of about 2  gev ( see the solid lines in figs .",
    "[ fig : tot(pi+pi-)_vm ] and [ fig : tot(pi+pi-)_vmf2 ] ) , the corresponding results for the @xmath237 cross section are unsatisfactory ( see the solid lines in figs .  [",
    "fig : tot(pi0pi0)_vm ] and [ fig : tot(pi0pi0 ) ] ) .",
    "a comparison of the two latter figures shows the large dependence on the background from meson exchange .",
    "furthermore , the results for the @xmath237 cross section from unsubtracted drs do not describe the data for energies above 500  mev . a much better description of the data is obtained by the subtracted dr with the subtraction constant as predicted by chpt at the two - loop level  @xcite ( dashed line in fig .  [",
    "fig : tot(pi0pi0)_vm ] ) .",
    "the polarizabilities of the pion are elementary structure constants and therefore fundamental benchmarks for our understanding of qcd in the confinement region .",
    "moreover , these polarizabilities have been calculated in chpt to the two - loop order with an estimated error of less than 20  % .",
    "it is therefore disturbing that predictions based on dispersion theory  @xcite yield @xmath23 in the range of @xmath238 , whereas chpt  @xcite predicts @xmath239 , all in units of @xmath240 .",
    "this discrepancy originates from huge contributions of intermediate meson states in the approach of ref .",
    "in particular , the @xmath147 exchange in the @xmath28 channel provides about 10 units for both neutral and charged pions . for neutral pions ,",
    "this @xmath147 contribution is canceled by vector mesons , notably @xmath106 exchange yielding a value of @xmath241 , with the result of @xmath242 .",
    "the large positive value for charged pions results because ( i ) the @xmath106 does not contribute in this case and ( ii ) axial vector mesons provide additional positive contributions of about 4 units . in chpt ,",
    "on the other hand , the vector mesons enter only at @xmath243 through vector - meson saturation of low - energy constants .",
    "they are usually treated in the zero - width approximation and estimated to yield a much smaller effect for the polarizability , e.g. , the @xmath106 contributes only about 1 unit to the neutral pion polarizability  @xcite .",
    "the apparent discrepancy between the two approaches can be attributed to the specific forms for the imaginary part of the compton amplitudes  @xcite , which serve as input for the dispersion integrals determining the polarizability at the compton threshold ( @xmath244 ) . in order to quantify the strong model dependence of this procedure ,",
    "we have studied six different analytical forms including the model of refs .",
    "we recall that all these models are fitted to the same masses and widths of the exchanged mesons , and in this sense they represent the experimentally known information in the same way . concentrating on the important @xmath106 meson and the forward polarizability , we find from table  [ table3 ] that the models @xmath119 , @xmath120 , and @xmath121 ( with a constant coupling strength ) predict a contribution of about 0.7 for the sum of @xmath27 and @xmath80 channel , in reasonable agreement with ref",
    ".  @xcite .",
    "the energy dependence of the coupling constant in models",
    "@xmath113 , @xmath114 , and @xmath115 leads to an unphysical left cut ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : modelc ] ) and increases the contribution to the real part by a factor @xmath245 . however , all the models agree if only the right cut is accounted for .",
    "if we now turn to the backward polarizability , we expect from eq .",
    "( [ eq : models ] ) that the paramagnetic dipole transition involved leads to a mere sign change compared to the forward polarizability , as is indeed reproduced by the real part in table  [ table4 ] .",
    "however , the right - cut integral has increased to large absolute values . as a consequence",
    ", the dispersion integral over the right cut from two - pion threshold to infinity does not converge to a ( plausible ) continuation of the real part to the compton threshold .",
    "the missing contributions to yield the real part are provided by unphysical features of the models .",
    "we conclude that the strong singularities in the form of poles ( e.g. , photon - pion `` bound states '' ) or unphysical cuts on the first riemann sheet are disturbing , because they violate the basic prerequisites of dispersion theory . for this reason we do not see any conflict between dispersion theory",
    "_ per se _ and chpt . of course",
    ", this does not exclude the possibility of unexpected higher - order corrections in chpt .",
    "however , our present knowledge on vector mesons and their coupling to the electromagnetic field does not indicate such large higher - order effects .",
    "+ the arguments about the @xmath147 exchange in the @xmath28 channel are more subtle . in sec .",
    "[ sec : models ] we have used the parameters of ref .",
    "@xcite who put the pole position at @xmath246  gev .",
    "the more recent analyses of pion - pion scattering find such a resonance at @xmath247  gev  @xcite and @xmath248  gev  @xcite .",
    "its large width of at least 500  mev and low mass ( only about 300  mev above two - pion threshold ) lead to a complicated line - shape .",
    "however , we consider it dangerous to model this resonance with @xmath249 factors  @xcite because of the divergence exactly at the point @xmath86 where the polarizability is determined .",
    "instead we prefer the method outlined in sec .",
    "[ sec : t - channel ] , which follows ref .",
    "@xcite and also previous calculations using @xmath28-channel drs to determine the nucleon s polarizability  @xcite . in this way",
    "the amplitudes are directly constructed from the pion - pion phase shifts , at least in the region below four - pion threshold .",
    "our numerical results yield an s - wave contribution of about 6 units for both charged and neutral pions , that is , only half of the value predicted for the @xmath147 contribution by ref .",
    "+ our calculations based on unsubtracted drs for the compton amplitudes are in reasonable agreement with chpt for the charged pion , whereas some agent is missing to reduce the backward polarizability of the neutral pion to the small values predicted by chpt .",
    "contrary to the charged pion , the neutral - pion cross section is not well described by unsubtracted drs , and therefore no reliable prediction for @xmath250 is possible at present .",
    "the open questions in this field deserve further studies along the lines presented in recent and ongoing work  @xcite . at the same time also",
    "new and independent experimental information as well as improved analysis of existing data are necessary .",
    "we repeat that the polarizability of the pion is a fundamental benchmark of qcd in the realm of confinement .",
    "it is therefore of utmost importance to clarify the yet existing discrepancies among the predictions of experiment and theory .",
