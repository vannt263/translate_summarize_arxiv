    ", the data is acquired with a series of measurements performed on a large number of identically prepared copies of a quantum system .",
    "the fact that this transformation is linear , makes it strongly dependent of any experimental error that may occur while recording the data .",
    "it can appear as a consequence of the experimental noise or misalignment and therefore , the reconstructed state is only a reasonable approximation of the real quantum state .",
    "the density matrices obtained may have properties that are not fully compatible with a quantum state .",
    "another alternative that has been considered for the state determination is the numerical technique called maximum likelihood estimation @xcite .",
    "it is based on a relation between the measured data and the quantum state that could have generated them . even though it generates only possible density matrices , it has the drawback of enhancing the uncertainty on the state estimation .    in this article",
    "we are interested in the determination of the state of a composite system . in our experiment",
    ", the system corresponds to two photons generated by spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) . in this nonlinear process",
    "a photon from a pump laser beam incident to a non - linear crystal originates probabilistically two photons , signal and idler @xcite .",
    "the photons of this pair are also called twin photons for being generated simultaneously @xcite .",
    "recently , we have demonstrated that by placing @xmath0 symmetric slits at the path of each twin photon it is possible to use the transverse correlations of the photon pair to generate maximally entangled states of two effective @xmath0-dimensional quantum systems @xcite .",

    "we show both theoretically as well as experimentally , that one can implement the process of qtr to obtain the density operator of a state composed of two spatial qubits .",

    "each qudit is represented by a state in a hilbert space of dimension @xmath0 , being @xmath0 the number of available paths for its transmission through the multi slits array .",
    "it can be seen from ( [ stgeral ] ) and ( [ wlm ] ) , that it is possible to create different pure states of spatial qudits if one knows how to manipulate the pump beam in order to generate distinct transverse profiles at the plane of the multi slits ( @xmath18 ) @xcite .",
    "let us now assume that , before reaching the crystal , the pump beam pass through an unbalanced mach - zehnder interferometer where the transverse profile of the laser beam is modified differently in each arm .",
    "if the difference between the lengths of these arms is set larger than the laser coherence length , we will obtain an incoherent superposition of the spatial qudits states generated by each arm .",
    "we show in the following section how to use the qtr technique to determine the density matrix of these composite systems .",

    "however , if the laser beam cross only arm 2 , the state of the twin photons transmitted by these apertures will be given by @xmath42 where @xmath43 . and",
    "now the correlation of this spatial qubits is different since we can also have both photons of the pair generated , crossing their upper or lower slits , simultaneously .",
    "therefore , the two - photon state generated in our experiment when the two arms are liberated , is a mixed state of the spatial maximally entangled state shown in ( [ qubittomo ] ) and the state of ( [ prodtomo ] ) .",
    "it is described by the density operator @xmath44 where a and b are the probabilities for generating the states of arm 1 and arm 2 , respectively .",
    "now , we show how qtr can be experimentally implemented to reconstruct the density operator of the state ( [ opdenstomo ] ) generated in our setup without the use of any information about the scheme used for this generation .",
    "let us briefly review the process of quantum tomography .",
    "the diagonal elements of any density operator can be measured directly .",
    "therefore , quantum tomographic reconstruction is a protocol to determine the non - diagonal elements .",
    "it consists in the use of known unitary transformations on the system .",
    "each transformation generates a new density operator whose diagonal elements are a combination of the coefficients of the transformation and of the non - diagonal elements of the original density operator . these new diagonal elements can be measured .",
    "the iteration of this procedure creates a set of equations which allows the determination of the non - diagonal elements of the initially unknown density operator . for a detailed account on this subject",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "to characterize the density operator generated in our experiment , we first adopt a general form for it    @xmath45    as we are dealing with two qubits states , the total number of measurement basis necessary for the qtr is nine @xcite .",
    "they can be generated by using three basis for each qubit . since we have spin 1/2 like systems , these basis are the eigenvectors of the pauli operators @xmath46 . in our case ,",
    "the eigenvectors of @xmath47 are the slit s states given by ( [ base ] ) .",
    "they form the logical base , such that @xmath48 .",
    "measurements in basis @xmath49 in mode @xmath12 require local unitary operations @xmath50 , which allow us for going from @xmath51 eigenvectors to @xmath52 eigenvectors , respectively",
    ". the density operator under these local transformations can be written as    @xmath53    with @xmath54 .",
    "since the @xmath47 eigenvectors are the slit s states , the question which remains is : how one can implement the above discrete local operations in these slit s states to perform the qtr of @xmath55 ?",
    "for answering this , we first consider the state of a photon crossing a given slit @xmath14 ( @xmath56 ) along mode @xmath12 ( @xmath57 ) , and propagating through the free space to a detection plane located at position @xmath58 .",
    "this state can be calculated by the method presented in @xcite and is described by    @xmath59    it corresponds to the free evolution of the state @xmath60 generated by the unitary operator @xmath61 ( restricted to the one - photon subspace ) , that is @xmath62 .",
    "the operator @xmath61 is given by @xmath63 where @xmath64 .    therefore , if we propagate the state @xmath55 from the plane-@xmath65 to plane-@xmath58 the result is    @xmath66    and it becomes clear that @xmath67 and @xmath68 have the same coefficients , and thus , that one can reconstruct @xmath55 by determining @xmath69 , i.e , by doing the measurements in the detection plane - z",
    ".    it can be deduced from ( [ g+- ] ) that photons spread out along the measurement plane , so that we have passed from discrete variables , states @xmath70 , to a continuously distributed state @xmath71 .",
    "thus , for carrying out the measurement in discrete basis in plane-@xmath58 , we need to implement an adequate postelection process , which will allow us to recover the discrete nature of the logical states .",
    "as we shall show in the following lines , this can be properly done by allocating at the detection plane two new slits for each mode j.    in order to explicitly show how the transformations @xmath72 and @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) can be implemented to do the qtr for @xmath75 , we first write an arbitrary two photon pure state in the transverse plane-@xmath58 as    @xmath76    the transmitted state through the double slits placed at the detection plane is    @xmath77    where the transmitted state biphoton amplitude is given by @xcite    @xmath78    @xmath79 is the fourier transform of the double slits transmission function at mode @xmath12    @xmath80    where @xmath81 is the position of the slit @xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) in mode @xmath12 at the plane-@xmath58 . by replacing the expressions for the states",

    ", we obtain @xmath86 . after a straightforward derivation ,",
    "we can rewrite the two photon transmitted state ( [ transmitted s ] ) as    @xmath87    where    @xmath88    the states of the post - selected photons which crossed this additional pair of slits are described by    @xmath89    where @xmath81 is the position of the slit @xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) in mode @xmath12 at the plane-@xmath58 .",
    "the transversal position of these slits determines which effective unitary operation was performed at the transmitted photon .",
    "we have also defined    @xmath90    here , by comparing ( [ psi_transmitted ] ) and ( [ psizg+_g- ] ) , it can be observed that the post selection process acts on the @xmath91 states with the following effective transformation @xmath92 where @xmath93 state denotes the post selected state arising from @xmath94 state . by considering the value of the experimental parameters : @xmath95 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath96",
    ", it can be shown that the states @xmath97 and @xmath98 are orthogonal when the condition @xmath99 is satisfied .",

    "we remark that we refer to the transformations done by these slits as effective transformations , due to the fact that they act as unitary transformations only for the photons in mode @xmath12 which were transmitted through the pair of slits at the detection plane .",
    "because of the linearity of quantum mechanics and because we are performing only local operations to the twin photons , we know that the diagonal elements of @xmath108 operators are linear combinations of the coefficients @xmath109 of ( [ pz ] )",
