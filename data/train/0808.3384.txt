    "the consensus of the astrophysics community is that a large fraction of the universe s mass consists of non - luminous , non - baryonic material , known as dark matter @xcite .",
    "although the nature of this substance or substances remains unknown , weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) represent a particularly attractive and well motivated class of possibilities .",
    "although the most studied wimp candidate is the lightest neutralino @xcite in supersymmetric models , many other possibilities have also been proposed , including kaluza - klein states in models with universal @xcite or warped @xcite extra dimensions , stable states in little higgs theories @xcite , and many others .    in each of the above mentioned cases",
    ", many new particle species , in addition to the wimp itself , are expected to lie within the discovery reach of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , making the task of deducing the nature of the wimp immeasurably simpler . in supersymmetry , for example , gluinos and squarks",
    "are expected to be produced prolifically . by studying the cascades produced in the decays of such particles , the masses of several superparticle masses , including the lightest neutralino ,",
    "are likely to be determined",
    ". if squarks , gluinos , and other additional superpartners are too heavy to be produced , however , the lightest neutralino will also be very difficult to study at the lhc , even if rather light itself .",
    "more generally speaking , in the absence of heavier particles with shared quantum numbers , wimps will not be easily detected or studied at the lhc .",
    "although an electroweak scale , cold thermal relic particle , if it exists , would almost certainly be produced at the lhc , identifying and characterizing the nature of the wimp simply from missing energy studies is a daunting , perhaps impossible , task @xcite .",
    "although the usual list of prospective wimps mentioned above contains some very attractive and well - motivated candidates for dark matter , there are certainly many possible forms of dark matter that have not yet been considered .",
    "as the first observations of particle dark matter might well come from direct and/or indirect detection experiments , it is possible that these results may be misinterpreted as a result of theoretical bias , anticipating dark matter to have the properties of a neutralino or other often studied candidates . to avoid such confusion ,",
    "model - independent studies of dark matter phenomenology can play an important role ( for previous work in this direction , see refs.@xcite ) .    in this article , rather than consider a wimp candidate from a specific theoretical model , we study model - independent wimps with different combinations of spins and interaction forms with standard model particles .",
    "these interactions are limited only by the requirements of lorentz invariance and a consequent wimp abundance consistent with cosmological observations . for each spin and interaction form",
    ", we evaluate the constraints from and prospects for direct and indirect detection of wimps in current and future experiments .",
    "although we will be forced to adopt some assumptions in order to make the problems at hand tractable , we attempt to be as general as possible throughout our study . beyond the starting point",
    "that the dark matter is a wimp in the form of a single species of a cold thermal relic , we adopt only two assumptions :    1 .",
    "any new particle species in addition to the wimp has a mass much larger than the wimp .",
    "the wimp interactions with standard model particles are dominated by those of one form ( scalar , vector , _ etc . _ ) .",
    "an implication of the first assumption is that the wimp s thermal abundance is not affected by resonances or coannihilations . at a later stage of this paper",
    ", we will discuss the impact of relaxing these assumptions .",
    "the remainder of this paper is structured as follows . in sec.[fermion ] we explore the phenomenology of a generic fermionic wimp , including its annihilation cross section and relic abundance , elastic scattering cross section and direct detection prospects , and indirect detection prospects in the form of a neutrino flux from the sun and gamma rays and charged particles produced in galactic annihilations . in sec .",

    "we also consider dark matter candidates from specific particle physics frameworks and discuss how they fit into our model - independent analysis . in sec .",
    "[ conclusion ] we summarize our results and present our conclusions .",
    "we begin with the case of a fermionic wimp , and study five types of interactions consistent with the requirement of lorentz invariance . as mentioned in the introduction , we assume that the wimp is the only new particle at the electroweak scale .",
    "this enables us to describe the interaction between wimps and standard model fermions in terms of an effective field theory , in which we keep only the first term in the @xmath0 expansion of the heavy propagator term ( here , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the momentum and mass of the propagator , respectively ) .",
    "we note that the effective interaction lagrangians are not invariant under the standard model @xmath3 gauge symmetry ; however , this is acceptable as our theory need only be valid at energy scales below the scale of electroweak symmetry breaking .    to begin , we only consider wimp annihilations to fermion - antifermion pairs , neglecting for the moment the possibility of final states that include gauge or higgs bosons .",
    "in particular , we consider the following interaction lagrangians between two fermionic wimps ( @xmath4 ) and two standard model fermions ( @xmath5 ) : @xmath6    we will now proceed to calculate the annihilation cross section , relic density , and elastic scattering cross sections for a fermionic wimp .      in each of the cases listed above",

    "<S> despite compelling arguments that significant discoveries of physics beyond the standard model are likely to be made at the large hadron collider , it remains possible that this machine will make no such discoveries , or will make no discoveries directly relevant to the dark matter problem . in this article </S>",
    "<S> , we study the ability of astrophysical experiments to deduce the nature of dark matter in such a scenario . in most dark matter studies , </S>",
    "<S> the relic abundance and detection prospects are evaluated within the context of some specific particle physics model or models ( _ e_.g . , supersymmetry ) . here </S>",
    "<S> , assuming a single weakly interacting massive particle constitutes the universe s dark matter , we attempt to develop a model - independent approach toward the phenomenology of such particles in the absence of any discoveries at the large hadron collider . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we consider generic fermionic or scalar dark matter particles with a variety of interaction forms , and calculate the corresponding constraints from and sensitivity of direct and indirect detection experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the results may provide some guidance in disentangling information from future direct and indirect detection experiments . </S>"
