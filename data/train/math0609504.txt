    "the purpose of these notes is to introduce the reader to the techniques of exterior differential systems ( eds ) in the context of a problem in billiards .",
    "the approach in this article is different from that of @xcite and @xcite , which begin with a study of linear pfaffian systems , an important special class of eds .",
    "the billiard problem results in an eds that is not a linear pfaffian system , so these notes deal immediately general eds . for the interested reader , two references regarding eds",
    "are @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the first is a definitive reference and the second contains an introduction to the subject via differential geometry . for more details about anything regarding eds the reader can consult either of these two sources .",
    "cartan s book on eds @xcite is still worth looking at , especially the second half , which is a series of beautiful examples .",
    "we generally will work in the real analytic category , although all the non - existence results discussed here imply non - existence of smooth solutions .      if @xmath0 is a differentiable manifold we let @xmath1 denote its tangent and cotangent bundles , @xmath2 the set of differential forms on @xmath0 of degree @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "if @xmath5 is a subbundle ( more precisely , subsheaf ) , then we let @xmath6 denote the differential ideal generated by @xmath7 , i.e , all elements of @xmath8 of the form @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath12 denotes the linear span of the vectors @xmath13 if they are vectors , and the subbundle of @xmath14 they generate if they are one - forms .",
    "let @xmath15 be a convex domain with its flat metric .",
    "let @xmath16 denote the standard laplacian on @xmath17 .",
    "then weyl @xcite conjectured and ivrii @xcite proved @xmath18 where more precisely , weyl proved the first term is indeed the leading term and ivrii proved the correction term ( @xmath19 with dirchlet , @xmath20 with neumann boundary conditions ) , but subject to the following possibly extraneous hypothesis :    _ that there does not exist a two parameter family of periodic billiard trajectories in @xmath17 . _    in fact weyl and ivrii work in @xmath21 dimensions but we have restricted to @xmath22 for notational simplicity .",
    "also , ivrii s actual restriction was that there was not a set of positive measure of periodic billiard trajectories in the space of all trajectories , but for the problem at hand , that is equivalent to the statement above , as remarked in @xcite .",
    "i will report on joint work with y. barishnikov and v. zharnitsky investigating whether this additional hypothesis is actually necessary or not . but",
    "first , i must explain the hypothesis .",
    "let @xmath23 be a smooth curve . a _ billiard trajectory _",
    "is defined by a particle traveling in straight lines in the interior of @xmath24 and reflecting at the boundary subject to the law that the angle of incidence with the tangent line to the curve equals the angle of reflection .",
    "a trajectory is _ periodic _ if it closes up and repeats itself .",
    "the number of collisions it has with the boundary of @xmath24 before repeating is called its _",
    "period_.    for example , if @xmath24 is a circle , then there are many periodic trajectories .",
    "moreover , given a periodic trajectory in the circle one can construct a one parameter family of such by varying the initial point and keeping the angle constant .",
    "it is also true that given an ellipse and a periodic trajectory on it , one can still obtain a one parameter family of periodic trajectories if one moves the angle just right as one displaces the initial point .",
    "one can locally parametrize the space of trajectories by putting a local parameter on the curve ( e.g. arclength ) and measuring the angle of the trajectory with the tangent line to the curve ( one thinks of shooting out a trajectory from that point ) .",
    "in particular , the set of trajectories is a two dimensional space and the existence of a two parameter family of periodic trajectories would mean that there is some point on the curve @xmath24 such that no matter what small perturbation of the initial angle and initial point one makes , the resulting trajectory is still periodic .    _ sound preposterous ?",
    "_    ivrii thought so .",
    "in fact , legend has it that ivrii was attempting to prove the correction term to weyl s formula and realized it he could prove it under the assumption that there are no periodic billiard trajectories in the domain .",
    "fortunately for him ( he thought ) , he was at moscow state university , where there were many world experts on billiards .",
    "allegedly he went in to ask them if there could be such a curve - they quickly answered : of course not ! , so he said great !",
    "may i please have a proof?- they said certainly .",
    "they had trouble coming up with a full argument immediately so they told him to come back later in the afternoon .",
    "he returned later that afternoon and they told him that perhaps it would be better to return the next day ... then it became the next week , ...",
    "all this was nearly 30 years ago and the question is pretty much as open today as it was then .",
    "some things are known : for a similar problem the answer is that there _ are _ such things : there exist compact surfaces with riemannian metrics , all of whose geodesics are closed @xcite .",
    "these are called _ zoll surfaces",
    "_ and there are more of them than was originally expected .    the progress on ivrii s question is as follows : we may break it up into a series of questions based on the period of the trajectory .",
    "it is easy to see that there can be at most a @xmath25-parameter family of two - periodic trajectories .",
    "( hint : what happens when you change the angle a little ? )    in 1989 rychlik @xcite proved that there are no curves supporting an open set of @xmath26-periodic trajectories .",
    "now there are three published proofs of rychlik s theorem @xcite , and in these lectures i will give you a fourth . the four periodic case is still open and that is the subject of my current research with baryshnikov and zharnitsky .",
    "( the results in this section are joint work with baryshnikov and zharnitsky . )",
    "the problem is local .",
    "if we want an @xmath21-periodic trajectory , we only need @xmath21 bits of curve .",
    "we can later close up the bits any way we please ( as long as it closes convexly ) .",
    "let @xmath27 .",
    "we want to construct @xmath21 ( germs of ) curves , one passing through each point .",
    "the initial points determine an initial @xmath21-gon which in turn tells us what the tangent lines to the curves must be at the @xmath28 .",
    "i.e. , the @xmath21 points immediately determine the zero - th and first order terms of the taylor series for the curves .",
    "let @xmath29 and note that @xmath30 points in the direction of the tangent line to the curve we are trying to construct .",
    "let @xmath31 .",
    "let @xmath32 denote the rotation counterclockwise of @xmath33 by @xmath34 .",
    "we have the following picture        the tangent line at @xmath28 must be perpendicular to @xmath35 .",
    "let @xmath36 denote the nave configuration space ( the actual space is an open subset of this ) where @xmath37 is our initial point .",
    "define @xmath38 and for future reference set @xmath39 , let @xmath40 be the angle between @xmath41 and @xmath32 , and let @xmath42 be the length of the section from @xmath28 to @xmath43 .",
    "we have a _ distribution _",
    "@xmath16 on @xmath44 , namely @xmath45    any two parameter family of @xmath21-periodic trajectories corresponds to an immersed surface @xmath46 which is everywhere tangent to @xmath16 and subject to some additional genericity conditions .",
    "more precisely , we have    @xcite[blzprop ] there exists a one to one correspondence between ( segments of ) curves admitting an open subset of @xmath21-periodic trajectories and immersed surfaces @xmath47 tangent to @xmath16 satisfying    1 .",
    "no two points coincide 2 .",
    "no three points are colinear 3 .",
    "any two consecutive points move independently   in the manner made precise in condition described below .",
    "note that the first two conditions are zero - th order conditions regarding the initial point in @xmath44 about which we want to construct the surface .",
    "the last is a first order condition which may be described as follows :    note that @xmath48 gives a basis of @xmath49 and that this basis varies smoothly - one says @xmath50 form a _ coframing _ of of @xmath44 .",
    "the precise form of condition ( 3 ) for proposition [ blzprop ] is that @xmath51 where we use the convention that for indices @xmath52 .",
    "_ how can we determine the existence of such surfaces ?",
    "_    were we looking for @xmath21-folds , the answer would be given by the frobenius theorem :    given pointwise linearly independent one - forms @xmath53 on a manifold @xmath54 , there exists an immersed submanifold @xmath55 passing through @xmath56 on which @xmath57 for all @xmath58 ( i.e. , with @xmath59 for all @xmath60 ) if in a neighborhood of @xmath61 there exist one - forms @xmath62 such that @xmath63    the condition is often expressed as @xmath64 .",
    "in fact the individual forms do nt matter , just their span , so we could write @xmath65 and @xmath66 another way to express it is that locally if , @xmath67 are vector fields lying in @xmath16 , that @xmath68 $ ] also lies in @xmath16 .",
    "( exercise : verify that this is indeed equivalent . )",
    "note that all these conditions involve beginning with first order information and differentiating it once - if everything is ok , then we are guaranteed solutions .",
    "that is , we can stop working after taking two derivatives .    were we in the situation that there was just a single one - form , then _",
    "pfaff s theorem _",
    "( see , e.g. , @xcite  1.3 ) guarantees existence of submanifolds of dimension roughly half the dimension of the manifold .",
    "moreover , by computing the exterior derivative of the one - form one can determine the precise maximal dimension of a submanifold on which the form pulls back to be zero .    to deal with the general setting of determining existence of submanifolds",
    "on which an ideal of differential forms pulls back to be zero , an explicit algorithm was developed by cartan and others .",
    "the algorithm also gives a rough estimate of the size of the space of such manifolds .",
    "( e.g. , in the frobenius theorem , there is a unique such manifold through a point but for pfaff s theorem , there will be functions worth of solution manifolds through a point . )",
    "the essential question is : given a candidate tangent space ( a first order admissible taylor series ) , can we extend it ? - i.e. , can we fit together   potential tangent spaces to obtain a solution submanifold ?",

    "in fact one can solve explicitly for all the remaining @xmath288 in terms of @xmath289 .",
    "thus the space of integral elements satisfying the genericity condition is of dimension @xmath290 .",
    "the system @xmath291 has @xmath292 , @xmath293 , @xmath294 and thus fails cartan s test by one .",
    "here @xmath295 is just the codimension of the space of one - dimensional integral elements at a point of @xmath44 . to calculate @xmath186 ,",
    "one needs a sufficiently generic vector , @xmath296 will do .",
    "one then sees that @xmath297 is contained in a unique two - dimensional integral element .",
    "if one ignores the genericity conditions , as @xmath21 increases the dimensions of integral manifolds can be arbitrarily large ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the next proposition states that with the genericity conditions , this fails even at the infinitesimal level .    for all @xmath21 ,",
    "there are no @xmath26-dimensional integral elements to @xmath298 satisfying the genericity conditions .    on a three dimensional integral element",
    ", we must have say @xmath299 independent where @xmath300 and the @xmath301 s are some constants .",
    "first note that @xmath302 must be zero by considering @xmath303 , @xmath304 respectively .",
    "but we also must have @xmath305 independent , and since @xmath306 , this implies @xmath307 must be independent , which , using @xmath308 implies that @xmath309 .",
    "continuing in this fashion one obtains that all the @xmath301 must be zero .",
    "here the space of integral elements satisfying the billiard conditions is a single point . taking @xmath274 as our independence condition , writing @xmath310 , @xmath311 , we see that on integral elements @xmath312",

    "given an analytic riemannian manifold ( @xmath318 , does there exist a local isometric immersion into euclidean space @xmath319 ? the cartan - janet theorem states that for any analytic metric the answer is yes as long as @xmath320 .",
    "if the metric is special one can sometimes do much better , see @xcite for the cases of space forms and generalizations .      using eds bryant @xcite showed that there exist non - symmetric riemannian manifolds with holonomy @xmath321 and @xmath322 , settling the last open local existence questions in the riemannian case of berger s 1953 thesis @xcite .",
    "the abundance of special lagrangian and other calibrated submanifolds was first proved by harvey and lawson @xcite using the cartan - khler theorem .",
    "while describing the first two examples would involve too many definitions , we will explicitly describe two cases of applying the cartan - khler theorem to prove existence of calibrated submanifolds .",
    "a _ calibration _ on an oriented riemannian manifold @xmath44 is a closed differential form @xmath323 such that for all unit volume @xmath324 , @xmath325 .",
    "there are many variants on the definition .",
    "calibrations are a tool for finding volume minimizing submanifolds of @xmath44 because the fundamental lemma of calibrations says that if @xmath76 is an immersed submanifold on which @xmath326 then @xmath0 is volume minimizing in its homology class ( assuming @xmath0 is compact , there are variations when @xmath0 is noncompact ) , see @xcite .",
    "recently calibrated manifolds have become of central importance because of applications to physics .",
    "see , e.g. , joyce s lectures in @xcite .",
    "calibrations may be thought of as generalizations of normalized powers of the khler form , which itself gives rise to an involutive system ( the cauchy - riemann equations ! ) .",
    "we will discuss two additional calibrations , the _ special lagrangian calibration _ and the _ associative calibration_.    sometimes a calibration @xmath327 has a complementary form @xmath328 such that latexmath:[\\[\\label{comp }    @xmath128 . in such cases",

    "moreover , it is easy to see any submanifold calibrated by @xmath195 is lagrangian , so @xmath335 is an eds whose integral manifolds are the special lagrangian submanifolds .",
    "given @xmath134 , we can change coordinates so that @xmath128 is annihilated by @xmath228 .",
    "( this is because the system is @xmath336 invariant and @xmath336 acts transitively on the special lagrangian planes at a point and even transitively on flags in special lagrangian planes . )",

    "the requirement that @xmath340 is one additional equation ( @xmath341 ) on the set of lagrangian @xmath21-planes so the codimension of @xmath122 is one greater than the lagrangian case and the system is involutive , with solutions depending on two functions of @xmath264 variables .",
