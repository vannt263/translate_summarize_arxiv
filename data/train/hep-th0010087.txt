    "orbifolds describe an interesting category of compactification schemes likely to provide useful physical models based on _ m_-theory .",
    "the fundamental example of an _",
    "m_-theory orbifold , based on @xmath1 , was presented in @xcite , and examples based on @xmath2 were presented in @xcite . since these incorporate nonperturbative aspects of related models , an algorithm for sifting through the various possibilities would complement and extend the perturbative string orbifold models classified more than ten years ago @xcite .",
    "indeed , nonperturbative _",
    "m_-theory orbifolds could overcome the phenomenological shortcomings endemic in the string perturbative case .",
    "in two previous papers @xcite , we outlined much of the technology needed to ascertain microscopic properties of _ m_-theory orbifolds , emphasizing the role of local anomaly cancellation in the determination of local  twisted \" sector gauge groups and matter content . in those papers , as in this present one , we concentrate on the case of @xmath3 orbifolds compactifications see e.g. @xcite .",
    "] , since these encorporate most of the fundamental issues which attend more general cases . in @xcite",
    ", we described special constraints which arise at fixed - plane intersections , and delineated the various contributions to both the quantum and inflow anomalies .",
    "in particular , we introduced the necessity for an intersection anomaly in orbifolds .",
    "this allows one to determine twisted gauge groups localized on odd - dimensional orbifold planes , which do not themselves support a local anomaly .",
    "subsequent papers @xcite then supplied additional and complementary input to this technology . in @xcite , we also explained how fivebranes may mediate transitions linking different ",
    "phases \" describing separate solutions to the local anomaly cancellation requirements .    in this paper , we extend our previous results and technology to include non - prime orbifolds",
    ". we present a detailed local analysis of anomaly cancellation in all four @xmath3 orbifolds describing degenerations of the sort @xmath4 .",
    "( these exist for the cases @xmath5=2,3,4 and 6 . )",
    "this rounds out the presentation in @xcite and complements the analysis in @xcite .",
    "some of the results in this paper were previously presented in @xcite .",
    "however , our technology differs , and we also have new results which more fully unify the overall discussion . specifically , we find a systematics associated with the orbifold projection of seven - dimensional gauge groups onto cartan subgroups .",
    "this enables a discussion of possible phase transitions , and indicates smooth interconnections linking various possible phases of the moduli space .",
    "we expect that intersection anomalies will play a crucial role in eventual studies of _ m_-theory phenomenology . in this paper",
    ", we present a comprehensive list of models describing portions of the low - energy moduli space corresponding to _ m_-theory compactified on @xmath3 orbifolds , and we discuss a number of technical and conceptual issues associated with these . the technology is developed with the expressed intent of enabling a search for phenomenologically more interesting compactifications to four dimensions .",
    "our aim is to partially delineate how nonperturbative effects , particularly those involving fivebrane - mediated phase transitions , can modify phenomenological predictions based on perturbative orbifolds , and also to facilitate the search for a more fundamental description of _ m_-theory .",
    "significant progress along these lines has already been achieved in heterotic _",
    "m_-theory models @xcite .",
    "these are based on the hoava - witten @xmath1 orbifold compactified to four dimensions on suitable calabi - yau threefolds @xmath6 . clearly , new _",
    "m_-theory models can be obtained by replacing these calabi - yau manifolds , and indeed all of @xmath7 , by more general non - perturbative orbifolds .",
    "this paper is a step in that direction .",
    "each of the @xmath8 orbifolds describes a brane world involving a pair of parallel ten - planes linked by some number of parallel seven - planes with six - plane intersections .",
    "the seven - planes correspond to the @xmath9 singularities of the @xmath10 orbifold degenerations . ] . for reasons motivated in @xcite",
    ", one expects that each @xmath9 seven - plane should support an @xmath11 gauge theory . in that paper ,",
    "consistent models were presented with this feature for each of @xmath5=2,3 and 4 , but not for the case @xmath5=6 .",
    "for the case @xmath5=6 , the authors of @xcite present one model",
    "( with gauge group @xmath12 ) which requires that the secondary @xmath13 seven - planes support @xmath14 gauge groups instead of @xmath15 . in that case , the @xmath14 factor is invisible in the infrared limit , and all anomalies do cancel .",
    "an observation pointed out in @xcite is that whenever infrared - visible @xmath14 factors appear there exist non - cancelled anomalies .",
    "they present only one example of this case , which is an @xmath5=4 model with gauge group @xmath16 , which has non - cancelled local gravitational , mixed _ and _ gauge anomalies in both the abelian factors as well as the nonabelian factor . in this paper",
    ", we present a new class of @xmath5=6 models , with gauge group @xmath17 , for @xmath18 , in which all gravitational and mixed anomalies , as well as all nonabelian gauge anomalies do cancel . furthermore , our model has @xmath19 gauge groups on each of the @xmath20 seven - planes , including all secondary planes .",
    "we see the ( highly nontrivial ) cancellation of all gravitational , mixed and nonabelian gauge anomalies as an encouraging sign .",
    "we relegate the resolution of the remaining abelian gauge anomalies to a future paper .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in section 2 , we review the basics of _ m_-theory orbifold anomaly analyses for the case of prime orbifolds .",
    "we also introduce streamlined conventions relative to our previous papers and present a generalized proof , based on anomaly cancellation , that certain orbifold fixed planes can sequentially absorb ( or emit ) fivebranes from ( or into ) the eleven - dimensional bulk while maintaining consistency .",
    "this requires that the fivebrane tensor fields involve interesting dynamics which allow a localized version of the green - schwarz mechanism . in section 3 , we extend our technology to include nonprime orbifolds . in section 4 , we explain how to reduce the anomaly calculation to a set of very efficient equations which only involve rational data parameterizing the orbifold geometry , magnetic and electric charges , and various group theory factors .",
    "this enables an algorithmic search for consistent orbifold vertices . in section 5",
    ", we explain the various consistent models which we have obtained by applying our technology to the orbifolds mentioned above , and explain how these models are interconnected by virtue of fivebrane - mediated phase transitions . in section 6 , we explain the microscopic details of the models described in section 5 .",
    "this is done by use of  vertex diagrams \" and  ladder diagrams \" which conveniently depict the salient geometric properties .",
    "we also include an appendix which tabulates all of the rational parameters needed to verify the consistency of each of the vertices presented in the main text .",
    "in this paper , we concentrate on the four @xmath8 orbifold limits of @xmath21 , corresponding to @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "we refer to these succinctly as the @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 orbifolds , respectively .",
    "the first two of these are prime orbifolds ( since @xmath5 is a prime integer in these cases ) and the second two are non - prime .",
    "each of these orbifolds has a pair of fixed ten - planes ( associated with the universal @xmath24 factor ) and , additionally , some number of parallel fixed seven - planes ( associated with the factor @xmath28 ) .",
    "each of the seven - planes transverally intersects each of the ten - planes once , at a particular six - plane .    for prime orbifolds ,",
    "the fixed seven - planes are indistinguishable .",
    "for instance , the @xmath24 orbifold has sixteen and the @xmath25 orbifold has nine of these . for non - prime orbifolds , there are distinguishable sets of fixed seven - planes .",
    "( we describe this in more detail in the following section . ) as a consequence , the analysis of local anomalies in non - prime orbifolds is more complicated , and requires a greater systematics , than in the case of prime orbifolds . in this section ,",
    "we recapitulate the systematics involved in analyzing prime orbifolds , so that we can readily extend the analysis to include both prime and non - prime orbifolds in subsequent sections .",
    "local anomaly matching on the two ten - planes uniquely determines that these planes each support a ten - dimensional @xmath29 super yang - mills multiplet @xcite .",
    "as explained in @xcite , additional , more stringent , constraints follow from local anomaly matching at each of the six - planes describing intersections of the ten - planes and the seven - planes . resolving these constraints allows one to determining various elements of data .",
    "these include local breaking patterns for the @xmath29 factors , a magnetic charge ( denoted @xmath30 ) associated with each six - plane , electric parameters ( denoted @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) associated with seven - dimensional chern - simons interactions , , @xmath31 and @xmath32 . ] a _ seven_-dimensional gauge group @xmath33 , and additional  twisted \" fields .",
    "the twisted fields can include seven - dimensional yang - mills multiplets and also six - dimensional @xmath34=1 vector , hyper and tensor multiplets .    in general , on a given ten - plane ,",
    "the associated @xmath29 factor is broken to a subgroup @xmath35 on the embedded intersection six - planes by the nontrivial action of @xmath28 on the components of the @xmath29 multiplet .",
    "we assume that @xmath36 is a direct product of simple and/or @xmath14 factors .",
    "we define @xmath37 as the number of such factors , so we can write @xmath38 . the field strength associated with @xmath39",
    "is described by a matrix - valued two - form @xmath40 .",
    "the twisted gauge group @xmath33 can likewise be broken on the intersection six - planes to a subgroup ( for instance , its cartan subgroup ) by the action of the universal @xmath24 factor .",
    "thus , we can write @xmath41 , where we define @xmath42 as the number of such factors . the field strength associated with @xmath43",
    "is described by a matrix - valued two - form @xmath44 .    on a given intersection six - plane ,",
    "the anomaly involves only those gauge field strengths associated with one of the @xmath29 factors and one of the @xmath33 factors .",
    "we concentrate on a particular six - plane and safely suppress any labelling which distiguishes which six - plane we are considering .",
    "it is convenient to describe all of the @xmath45 field strengths collectively using a notation @xmath46 , where @xmath47 . in this case , the anomaly on a given six - plane is described by an eight - form polynomial which we can write as = atrr^4 + b(trr^2)^2 + c^itrr^2f_i^2 + d^ijtrf_i^2f_j^2 + e^itrf_i^4 , [ ihat]where the various coefficients @xmath48 and @xmath49 are determined by summing each of the various quantum and inflow anomalies as explained in @xcite .    if there are no tensor fields in the local twisted spectrum , then the anomaly ( [ ihat ] ) must vanish identically . in this case , each of the coefficients @xmath48 and @xmath49 must independently vanish .",
    "if there is one twisted tensor field , then a local green - schwarz mechanism can cancel the anomaly provided @xmath50 factorizes as a product of two identical four forms . in this case , the requirement that @xmath50 be a complete square follows from supersymmetry ( since tensor multiplets contain anti - self dual tensor fields ) . in the general case , if there are @xmath51 local tensor multiplets , then anomaly matching requires that @xmath50 be a sum of @xmath51 complete squares . in any case ,",
    "cancellation or factorization of @xmath50 each requires that @xmath52 and @xmath53 , since these correspond to non - factorizable terms in the anomaly .",
    "henceforth , we assume that @xmath52 and @xmath53 , as required by the preceeding discussion .",

    "[ bcd]various mnemonics are involved in ( [ bcd ] ) .",

    "traces denoted  trace@xmath57 \" are _ weighted _ quantum traces which also involve divisors related to orbifold - plane multiplicity .",
    "for the prime orbifolds , this is defined simply f^r=_i=1^p _",

    "( thus , for hypermultiplets @xmath61 and for vector multiplets @xmath62 . )",
    "terms in ( [ bcd ] ) involving @xmath63 describe anomalies arising from ten - dimensional fields .",
    "terms involving @xmath64 describe anomalies due to additional six or seven dimensional twisted fields . and @xmath33 , the terms in ( [ bcd ] ) mnemonically involving @xmath64 will , in fact , include contributions from both @xmath40 and @xmath65 . ]",
    "finally , terms involving @xmath66 are inflow contributions involving only the seven - dimensional twisted group @xmath33 .",
    "note that the cancellation of @xmath49 is implicit in the last equation of ( [ bcd ] ) , since the right hand side can only factorize if this condition is satisfied .",
    "if @xmath67 , then we require that @xmath68 .",
    "if @xmath69 then , according to the discussion in the preceeding paragraph , we have a weaker requirement that the anomaly factorize as a complete square .",
    "this is only possible if 4bd^ij = c^ic^j .",
    "[ bdc]since this requirement includes the stronger case where all coefficients vanish , equation ( [ bdc ] ) describes a generic constraint valid when @xmath70 .",
    "_ horizontal hierarchy _ : + note that if we locally increment the hypermultiplet multiplicity and the tensor multiplet multiplicity each by one gauge singlet , and simultaneously increment the magnetic charge by one such that @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , then equation ( [ bcd ] ) tells us that b & & b-18 + c^itrf_i^2 & & c^itrf_i^2 + 12trf^2 + d^ijtrf_i^2f_j^2 & & d^ijtrf_i^2f_j^2 -12(trf^2)^2 . [ shift]furthermore , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are invariant under this shift as well .",
    "therefore , if we substitute the modified values of the coefficients back into ( [ ihat ] ) , we determine & & -18(trr^2)^2 + 12trr^2f^2 -12(trf^2)^2 + & = & -18(trr^2 - 2trf^2)^2 .",
    "so we observe that the net anomaly changes by the addition of one complete square .",
    "but , since the local twisted sector changes by the addition of one tensor multiplet , the net anomaly can be cancelled by a local green - schwarz mechanism mediated by the anti self - dual tensor field in this multiplet .",
    "we interpret this process as describing the absorption of a fivebrane onto the relevant intersection six - plane .",
    "+    this analysis generalizes to include the absorption of any integer number @xmath5 of fivebranes . in this general case",
    ", we have @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , and we determine & & -(trr^2 - 2trf^2)^2 + & = & -_i=1^m 18(trr^2 - 2trf^2)^2 .",
    "so , regardless of how many fivebranes we sequentially pile onto the six - plane , we can maintain anomaly freedom at the vertex provided each successive tensor multiplet independently mediates a green - schwarz mechanism .",
    "the process of two fivebranes successively absorbed onto a particular intersection six - plane is depicted in figure 1 , which employs the sort of  vertex - diagrams \" which were introduced and explained in @xcite .",
    "we aim to classify sets of consistent local vertices . for reasons also explained in @xcite , these are conveniently assembled into arrays such that each column contains vertices with a specific number @xmath51 of twisted tensors , and each row contains vertices with a specific value of the difference @xmath77 , where @xmath30 is the magnetic charge .",
    "the consistent sequential absorption of fivebranes therefore implies a horizontal motion in such an array of vertices , and we refer to the set of solutions in a given row of this array as describing a horizontal hierarchy .",
    "non - prime orbifolds have more than one type of fixed plane .",
    "hyperplanes fixed under the full discrete group we call _ primary_. _ secondary _ fixed planes are invariant under some subgroup of @xmath28 but comprise nontrivial multiplets under @xmath28 .",
    "for instance , the @xmath26 orbifold has four primary fixed planes invariant under @xmath26 and six additional secondary planes , each describing a @xmath26 doublet of planes invariant under @xmath78 . finally ,",
    "the @xmath27 orbifold has one primary fixed plane invariant under @xmath27 , four @xmath79 secondary planes assembled as @xmath27 doublets and five more @xmath80 secondary planes assembled as @xmath27 triplets .    for the case of prime orbifolds , it is straightforward to determine the untwisted contribution to the local anomaly .",
    "this is obtained by determining the _ total _ untwisted anomaly via index theorems and then distributing this result uniformly over the indistinguishable fixed planes . for the case of nonprime orbifolds ,",
    "the untwisted contribution is less straightforward to determine due to the distinguishability of the fixed planes . as explained in @xcite , it is nevertheless clear how to resolve this problem . in a nonprime orbifold ,",
    "the secondary planes are each identical to a primary fixed plane in a corresponding prime orbifold .",
    "( for instance , in the case of the @xmath27 orbifold the secondary @xmath79 fixed - planes are locally identical to the primary fixed planes in the @xmath25 orbifold . ) but , since we know the untwisted anomaly for the prime orbifolds , we can readily determine the total anomaly due to all secondary fixed - planes in the nonprime orbifolds . to determine the untwisted contribution to the local anomaly on the primary fixed planes of a nonprime orbifold , we first determine the total anomaly via index theorems , and then subtract off the net contribution from all of the secondary fixed - planes .",
    "what remains is then uniformly distributed over the set of primary fixed - planes , which are indistinguishable .",
    "it is straightforward to systemetize the process described in the previous paragraph .",
    "however , the analysis is facilitated if we first define a few useful conventions .",
    "we refer to a primary fixed - plane as a  1-type \" fixed - plane and a secondary fixed - plane as  2-type \" .",
    "if there are two distingishable types of secondary fixed - planes ( as in the case of the @xmath27 orbifold ) , then one of these is denoted  2-type \" and the other is denoted  3-type \" , with the distintion left as a choice of convention . and so forth .",
    "we then define @xmath81 as the number of @xmath82-type fixed - planes in the orbifold in question and @xmath83 as the number of primary - fixed planes for a prime orbifold of @xmath82-type .",
    "finally , @xmath84 is the number of ( untwisted ) hypermultiplets derived from the bulk supergravity in a prime orbifold of @xmath82-type . for each type of fixed plane",
    ", we can then define an  effective \" number of @xmath82-type fixed planes as f_(n)=b_n .",
    "each of the parameters defined so far plays a special role in the determination of the local anomalies .",
    "also useful are the  effective \" fixed plane multiplicity and the  net effective hypermultiplet ratio \" , respectively defined by f & & ( -_n1)^-1 + h & = & -_n1 .",
    "[ fh]furthermore , the @xmath28 projection can act to leave different subgroups @xmath85 invariant at the different @xmath82-type fixed planes , owing to the fact that on secondary planes only a subgroup of @xmath28 induces the projection on the @xmath29 root lattice .",
    "the relevant projection is partially accounted for by the multiplicities of vector and hyper multiplets which remain from the @xmath29 fields on the fixed six - planes of @xmath82-type .",
    "these are defined as @xmath86 and @xmath87 , respectively .",
    "cancellation of the @xmath88 anomaly locally , on a given intersection six - plane , requires n_h - n_v=30g-29n_t+p+q [ nhnv]where @xmath89 is the supergravity contribution and @xmath90 is the contribution deriving from the ten - dimensional @xmath29 fields .",
