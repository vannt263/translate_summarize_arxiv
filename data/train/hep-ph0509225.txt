    "in string theory , the moduli - mediation @xcite has been known for some time as a natural mechanism of supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking in low energy 4d effective theory .",
    "however , any reliable predictions can not be derived before all the moduli are stabilized and cosmological constant is fine - tuned to the observed vanishing value @xcite .",
    "recently , kklt have proposed an interesting set - up in which all the moduli are stabilized by flux and nonperturbative dynamics on branes @xcite .",
    "resultant susy ads vacuum is uplifted to ds vacuum by introducing additional source of susy breaking .",
    "soft susy breaking of visible sector in kklt set - up has been examined carefully under the assumption that the visible sector is sequestered from the susy - breaking uplifting sector .",
    "it is noticed that in this class of models the moduli - mediated susy breaking is typically @xmath0 and the loop - suppressed anomaly - mediation @xcite can play equally important roll .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss that this mixed modulus - anomaly mediation is equivalent to reducing the mediation scale in the moduli - mediation up to non - negligible yukawa interactions and realizes distinct pattern of susy breaking at low energy scale , which leads to its characteristic phenomenology .",
    "let us first define the kklt set - up following @xcite . throughout this paper ,",
    "we assume @xmath1 otherwise explicitly specified .",
    "we consider type iib string theory compactified on calabi - yau ( cy ) orientifold .",
    "dilaton , @xmath2 and complex structure moduli , @xmath3 are stabilized by introducing ns and rr three form fluxes , while khler moduli @xmath4 remain light at this stage . integrating out @xmath2 , @xmath3 and assuming a single khler modulus @xmath5 , low energy 4d effective action in superconformal formulation of n=1 supergravity is given by , @xmath6,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 denotes the chiral compensator superfield .",
    "4d metric in superconformal frame , @xmath8 is related to metric in the einstein frame , @xmath9 by @xmath10 .",
    "khler potential and superpotential are given by , @xmath11 where @xmath12 are chiral matter superfields while @xmath13 denote chiral field strengths of gauge supermultiplet .",
    "they can live on d3 brane or d7 brane wrapping on the 4-cycle of the cy orientifold .",
    "their kinetic functions are given by , @xmath14 where ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) for d3 and ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) for d7 @xcite .",
    "matter fields also originate in an intersection of two ( three ) d7 branes with @xmath19 ( @xmath15 ) @xcite .     in kklt",
    "set - up ]    in the minimal kklt setup , we introduce a gaugino condensation on d7 brane to stabilize the khler modulus @xmath5 .",
    "the nonperturbative dynamics generates exponential @xmath5 dependence in the superpotential and it breaks the no - scale structure of the model : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is original constant superpotential induced by the fluxes . the lower solid curve in fig .",
    "1 shows potential for @xmath5 obtained by integrating out @xmath22 in the einstein frame : @xmath23 the potential minimum is given by susy ads vacuum , @xmath24 with @xmath25 and the khler modulus is stabilized at @xmath26 .",
    "kklt propose to uplift this ads vacuum to ds vacuum by introducing an explicit source of susy breaking .",
    "this is done by @xmath27 brane trapped in a warped throat with a red - shift factor @xmath28 @xcite . in low - energy action",
    ", its effect is described by a spurion operator up to corrections further suppressed by @xmath29 @xcite : @xmath30 where @xmath31 with @xmath32 .",
    "dependence like @xmath33 can be introduced in ( [ n=0 ] ) by the exchange of kk modes besides @xmath34 , however it is expected that the coefficient x is further suppressed by the small warp factor , so its contribution to the sfermion mass can be ignored compared to the soft masses induced by @xmath35 and @xmath36 . ] integrating out c in the einstein frame , we obtain the following uplifting potential : @xmath37 strictly speaking , uplifting by @xmath27 brane predicts constant @xmath34 ( @xmath38 ) , however we leave @xmath39 free to cover potential extensions . desired ds vacuum can be achieved by fine - tuning @xmath40 as shown by the upper solid curve in fig.1 .",
    "this uplifting process slightly shifts the position of the minimum from the original susy preserving vacuum and induces non - zero @xmath41 .",
    "while @xmath42 is almost constant and @xmath43 is canceled by the uplifting .",
    "this leads to a hierarchy : @xmath44 actual minimization of the uplifted potential gives , @xmath45 suggesting that the loop - suppressed anomaly mediation is comparable to the moduli - mediation @xcite . here",
    ", we define @xmath46 which parameterizes their relative significance : @xmath47",
    "we calculate low energy mass - spectrum of visible fields in kklt set - up .",
    "their soft susy breaking is written as where @xmath48 denote fermions and @xmath49 is a generator of gauge group .",
    "] , @xmath50 where @xmath51 denote gauginos , @xmath52 represent sfermions and @xmath53 are canonically normalized yukawa couplings . just below the cut - off ,",
    "the standard calculation @xcite gives , @xmath54 where @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 for the moduli - mediated contribution and , @xmath58 for the anomaly - mediated contribution . note that interference terms appear due to non - zero @xmath59 @xcite . if visible gauge fields originate in d3 and no yukawa coupling with d7 singlets , the above formulas reduce to the pure anomaly - mediation . because it has been examined extensively by the literature and",
    "is plagued with tachyonic slepton , we assume d7 visible gauge fields ( @xmath18 ) which naturally lead to gauge coupling unification .",
    "surprising new feature of this mixed modulus - anomaly mediation arises from correspondence between renormalization group ( rg ) running in the moduli - mediation and the anomaly - mediation itself .",
    "they have precisely same form at one - loop if @xmath60 and yukawa couplings are vanishing except for fields satisfying @xmath61 .",
    "thus we can obtain analytic solutions for the soft terms in the mixed modulus - anomaly mediation up to corrections coming from yukawa couplings with @xmath62 : @xmath63 where @xmath64 and we used @xmath65 and ( [ alpha ] ) .",
    "have @xmath66 charges @xmath67 and @xmath68 is non - zero , @xmath67 components in @xmath69 behave as an effective d - term .",
    "thus further corrections appear for these components due to running of the @xmath66 coupling . ]",
    "these solutions show that net effect of the anomaly mediation is shifting messenger scale in the moduli - mediation from @xmath70 to _ the mirage messenger scale _ , @xmath71 .",
    "it is noted that this scale is not associated with any physical threshold and cut - off of the theory still stays at @xmath70",
    ". this new feature of the anomaly - mediation does not depend on detail of the co - existing mediation scheme as far as the above conditions are satisfied .",
    "fig . 2 , 3 show the results of numerical calculation for the gaugino and sfermion mass squares at @xmath72 tev .",
    "gauge and yukawa couplings at @xmath73 are estimated using 2-loop rg equations in the sm and subsequently evolved to @xmath74 gev by 1-loop rg equations in the mssm . the soft susy breaking terms are calculated by solving 1-loop rg equations imposing the boundary conditions ( [ soft1 ] ) at @xmath70 .",
    "we choose all the visible fields originating in d7 ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "shaded regions at @xmath75 correspond to the cases , @xmath76 assuming @xmath77 ambiguity .",
    "the minimal kklt predicts @xmath78 and @xmath79 gev .",
    "reduced mediation scale generally leads to squeezed ( compressed ) mass spectrum , which is distinct from any known mediation mechanisms .",
    "in particular , we have unified gaugino and the 1st and 2nd generation sfermion masses at @xmath80 because of @xmath81 .",
    "higgs and the third generation masses ( dashed curves ) are disturbed by yukawa couplings .",
    "note that these predictions are different from those of lower cut - off models because here gauge couplings still unify at @xmath70 .",
    "these distinct pattern of the spectrum can be tested by coming lhc and future ilc .",
    "let us examine the electroweak ( ew ) symmetry breaking in the mixed modulus - anomaly mediation .",
    "here we assume the minimal model with @xmath82 and @xmath83 terms : @xmath84 they can be solved by minimizing the tree - level higgs potential for fixed @xmath85 , latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned } \\label{eq : rewsb_condition } \\mu^2 & = & -\\frac{m_z^2}{2 } + \\frac{m^2_{h_1}-m^2_{h_2}\\tan^2\\beta}{\\tan^2\\beta-1 } , \\nonumber\\\\    figure 4 .",
    "shows @xmath82 and @xmath83 in the unit of @xmath87 . here",
    "all the visible matters live in the intersection ( @xmath88 ) and we fix @xmath89 .",
    "the dashed ( thin solid ) curves indicate the case , @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "@xmath92 in ( [ eq : rewsb_condition ] ) ensures that there s no ew symmetry breaking above the thin solid @xmath93 curve .",
    "increasing @xmath46 , lowered messenger scale weakens the radiative ew symmetry breaking @xcite and reduces @xmath94 .",
    "eventually @xmath95 is driven into negative and ew symmetry is restored .",
    "while the bino mass increases with @xmath46 , again because of the reduced messenger scale .",
    "these effects drive the lightest neutralino into a mixed state of bino and higgsino ( @xmath96 ) or pure higgsino ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "this qualitative feature is robust for different choices of matter fields although precise position of the mixed region and nature of the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) depend on the models .",
    "generally , heavier initial higgs mass or lower @xmath98 tends to introduce stop lsp and d3 slepton or large @xmath99 likely leads to stau lsp .",
    "if they are stable , they will pose severe constraints on the models . if the mixed or pure higgsino neutralino is lsp , faster annihilation rate and stronger interaction with nuclei will dramatically change the cold dark matter physics based on the conventional bino lsp scenario @xcite .",
    "thus the mixed modulus - anomaly mediation can have a considerable impact on cosmology as well as with hierarchically heavy gravitino and moduli fields @xcite .",
