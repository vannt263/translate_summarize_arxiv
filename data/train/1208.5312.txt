    "infinite dimensional morse theory ( see @xcite for a a systematic exploration ) is very useful in obtaining multiple solutions for nonlinear variational problems .",
    "the central concept in this theory is the critical group @xmath0 for a @xmath1-functional @xmath2 at an isolated critical point @xmath3 .",
    "the critical group describes the local property of @xmath4 near the critical point @xmath3 .",
    "on the other hand , bartsch and li @xcite introduced the critical group @xmath5 of @xmath4 at infinity , which describes the global property of the functional @xmath4 .    with these concepts we have the morse inequalities@xmath6 where @xmath7 is a formal series with nonnegative integer coefficients,@xmath8 in most applications",
    ", we may distinguish critical points using critical group , and we may find new critical points using the morse inequality .",
    "therefore , the study of the critical group is very important .    in 1979 , amann @xcite established the theory of saddle point reduction ( also called lyapunov - schmidt reduction in some literature ) .",
    "since then , saddle point reduction becomes an important method in critical point theory , and has been widely applied to various nonlinear boundary value problems @xcite .",
    "let @xmath9 be a separable hilbert space with norm @xmath10 , and @xmath11 .",
    "the basic assumption in saddle point reduction is the following    @xmath12 : :    @xmath13 are closed subspaces of @xmath14 such    that @xmath15 , and there exists a real number    @xmath16 such    that@xmath17    for all @xmath18 and    @xmath19 .",
    "then by saddle point reduction , there exist @xmath20 and @xmath21 such that @xmath22 is a critical point of @xmath23 if and only if @xmath24 is a critial point of @xmath4 ; moreover we have@xmath25 for case @xmath26 and with ` @xmath27 ' replaced by ` @xmath28 ' for case @xmath29 , see @xcite for a good proof of these results .",
    "thus , to find critical points of @xmath4 we may consider the reduced functional @xmath23 . since @xmath23 is defined on a subspace , it should be easier to study .",
    "as mentioned before , morse theory is a powerful tool in the study of variational problems .",
    "if we want to apply morse theory , naturally we need to study the relation between the critical group of @xmath23 and that of @xmath4 . in our previous work @xcite",
