    "ptcda deposited on ag(111 ) forms a highly ordered metal - organic interface , the electronic and geometric structure of which has been well - characterized using a variety of both experimental and theoretical techniques.@xcite the ptcda molecules form long - range ordered commensurate monolayers on the ag(111 ) substrate with two flat - lying chemisorbed molecules per unit cell in a herringbone arrangement ( see ref .  ) .",
    "the chemisorption results in the former lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) of the isolated molecule being shifted below the fermi level of the silver surface , so that there is charge transfer from the substrate to the molecule thus producing a net negative charge on the molecule.@xcite    in previous experiments we have found that it is possible to form a chemical bond between the carboxylic oxygen atoms and the stm tip , if the latter is approached towards the molecule above one of the carboxylic oxygen atoms:@xcite the oxygen atom , followed by part of the carbon skeleton of the ptcda molecule , jumps into contact with the tip .",
    "the most likely distance for this single switch to happen ( without applying a bias voltage ) is 6.65.@xcite in a theoretical analysis , carried out by calculating potential profiles of relaxed ptcda molecules between tip and surface as a function of oxygen - surface separation for a range tip sample separations , we found the spontaneous jump into contact at 6.2,@xcite in good agreement with experiment .",
    "once the molecular junction with the tip has been formed , there are two possible ways for the molecule to behave when the tip is retracted : either the molecule is peeled off from the surface completely or it falls back to the surface.@xcite we have further observed that , under certain conditions ( see below ) , the current fluctuates in time between a high- and a low - conductance state , see e.g. fig .  [ figure_1](b ) in which the telegraph noise in the current is evident .",
    "these two - state fluctuations can be explained by the switching of the molecule in and out of contact with the tip ( see fig .",
    "[ figure_1](a ) ) . in the high - conductance state , one of the carboxylic oxygen atoms of the molecule forms a chemical bond with the tip ( `` up - state '' ) , establishing a two - terminal molecular junction , while in the low - conductance state the molecule is bonded exclusively to the surface ( `` down - state '' ) so that a tunnel barrier is now present between the tip and the molecule .",
    "these switching processes of the molecule can also be seen in the topographic images taken with the tip very close to the surface.@xcite",

    "the ptcda molecules have been evaporated from a knudsen cell at 580 k onto the surface at room temperature .",

    "[ figure_1](b ) ) .",
    "the reason for choosing these molecules is that the ptcda molecules in the midst of a compact layer are more difficult to pick up due to strong intermolecular interactions with neighboring molecules via hydrogen bonds,@xcite while isolated molecules do not always fall back to the same position on the surface when they switch from the up- to the down - state , thereby leaving the junction and precluding the continued measurement of the switching time trace .",

    "[ experiments](b ) .",
    "we observe the following : ( 1 ) repeated switching occurs for both bias voltage polarities above a threshold of approximately @xmath5mev . in contrast , for @xmath6mev a single jump into contact occurs@xcite ( not indicated in fig .  [ experiments](b ) ) ; for these bias voltages , the junction may only ( but does not necessarily ) switch back from the up- to the down - state if the tip is retracted again beyond the tip - surface separation at which the jump into contact has originally occured ( hysteresis ) .",
    "( 2 ) repeated switching occurs in a narrow bracket of tip - surface separations in the range from 7.34 to 7.14 .",
    "( 3 ) the range in which repeated switching is observed appears at slightly larger tip - surface separations for negative bias than for positive bias .",
    "this latter fact may be related to the negative polarization of the carboxylic oxgen atoms in ag(111)-adsorbed ptcda .",
    "> from the i(t ) curve in fig .",
    "[ experiments](a ) one can see that for the chosen bias and tip - surface separation , the up - state is preferred : the statistical residence time analysis ( figs .",
    "[ experiments](c ) and ( d ) ) reveals a difference of more than one order of magnitude in the residence time values for the high- and low - conductance states .",
    "the single exponential behavior of the curves indicates a two state markovian switching process where the residence time probability density @xmath7 is given by the expression @xmath8 here , @xmath9 is the transfer rate between the two conductance states .",
    "it is obtained by fitting the equation for @xmath7 to the corresponding residence time histogram . by performing such a transfer rate analysis for different bias voltages",
    "one can determine the transfer rates as a function of bias for every measured tip - surface separation .",
    "the rates for three typical tip - surface separations are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fit_pioa ] .",
    "the tip@xmath10surface transfer rate increases monotonically with applied bias in the given voltage range , but the surface@xmath10tip transfer rate appears to have a maximum around 180mv .",
    "finally , both rates are dependent on the tip - surface separation , as can also be seen in the experimental data in fig .",
    "[ experiments](b ) .",
    "to gain insight into the observed current switching , we first focus on the nature of the coupling between ptcda and the surface , and then provide a link to the experimental data by applying a model calculation .",
    "the mechanisms of the chemical bonding of ptcda to ag(111 ) includes hybridization of the molecular orbitals with the substrate states , charge transfer between the substrate and the molecule , local bonds of the carboxylic oxygens to silver atoms below and an extended bond of the molecular @xmath11-system to the surface.@xcite assuming that the two meta - stable positions can be well - represented by a ( not necessarily symmetric ) double - well potential , the transfer of an adsorbate between the two minima may involve a variety of physical processes , such as ( i ) thermal activation , ( ii ) quantum tunneling , ( iii ) a transition through an electronic excited state with no conformational bi - stability , or ( iv ) vibrational heating .",
    "process ( i ) is of minor interest in this work , since the experiments are performed at very low temperatures ( 5 - 6 k ) and the barrier height is larger than 100mev , which excludes the thermal activation .",
    "due to the relatively large mass of the part of the molecule involved in the switching process , process ( ii ) is also very improbable . assuming a tunneling barrier of 100mev height ( measured from the vibrational ground state ) and 1 width ( cf .",
    "[ fig_overview](a ) ) the corresponding tunneling rate for the carboxylic oxygen atom was estimated to be of the order of @xmath12hz .",
    "for process ( iii ) , which involves an excited state of the molecule , the residence time of the tunneling electrons has to be sufficiently large to induce this excitation .",
    "however , since the molecule is chemisorbed on the ag(111 ) surface , this residence time is expected to be quite small , so that process ( iii ) also seems unlikely in this case .",
    "thus , we suggest that the microscopic mechanism leading to switching is related to vibrational heating , where the transition is induced by progressive vibrational excitation of the relevant chemical bond ( i.e. , either the oxygen - surface bond for the surface@xmath10tip process or the oxygen - tip bond for the reverse process ) by the inelastic scattering of tunneling electrons , eventually leading to bond breaking .",
    "the transition rate is then mainly determined by the competition between energy gain from the tunneling charges and energy losses due to electron - hole pair generation and/or coupling to the substrate phonon continuum .    in ref .",
    "gao et al .",
    "developed a theoretical model to describe atomic switching by vibrational heating .",
    "they concluded that the switching rate should exhibit a power law dependence @xmath13 on the bias voltage @xmath2 where @xmath14 is the number of vibrational levels that have to be climbed before the switch can occur . in our experiments",
    "we observe a striking difference between the tip@xmath10surface and surface@xmath10tip switching processes as far as the bias dependence of the switching rate is concerned ( cf .",
    "[ fit_pioa ] ) . while the tip@xmath10surface process shows an almost linear @xmath15 behavior in the double logarithmic plot , in essential agreement with the prediction of ref .  , a reasonable description within the model of gao _ _ et al.__@xcite for the surface@xmath10tip process is very unlikely , because @xmath15 deviates from a simple power law , showing a saturation of the transfer rate at approximately 120mv , with even a possible maximum around 180mv",
    ". moreover , a ( rather poor ) fit of the data in fig .",
    "[ fit_pioa](a ) with @xmath13 would only be possible by assuming @xmath16 ( cf . dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fit_pioa](a ) ) , which is in contrast to the calculated potential energy surfaces , see fig .  [ fig_overview](a ) .",
    "below we show that if the energy dependence of the density of states around the fermi level is taken into account explicitly , and if in particular _ different _ transport orbitals for the two configurations ( i.e. up- and down - states ) are used , the evident differences between the surface@xmath10tip and tip@xmath10surface processes can be rationalized and both the data in figs .",
    "[ fit_pioa](a ) and ( b ) can be fitted with parameters which are in qualitative agreement with dft results for the electronic structure of the molecular junction . in our model",
    ", we will neglect the coupling to the substrate phonon continuum , since the anharmonic coupling is , in general , very small at low temperatures .",
    "our model is a minimal approach based on that used in ref .   to describe the vibrational heating .",
    "the hamiltonian describing the tunneling of electrons between the stm tip and the surface via an adsorbate level ( in this case , the adsorbate being the ptcda molecule ) has the following form : @xmath17 here @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 label one - electron states @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 of the surface , the tip and the molecule , respectively , with the corresponding energies @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 . the hopping between the surface and the tip via the molecular level is described by the two terms including @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the coupling between the vibrational motion of the molecule and the electron propagating through it can be modeled by : @xmath29 where , @xmath30 the coupling is modeled by assuming that @xmath26 is a linear function of the vibrational coordinate @xmath31 , @xmath32 ; @xmath33 is the frequency of the molecular vibration with the normal coordinate @xmath34 and mass @xmath35 , and @xmath36 at @xmath37 .",
    "since the effect of the electron - vibration interaction on the adsorbate electronic states is in general weak , it can be treated by first - order perturbation theory .",
    "the assumed linearity in the charge - vibron coupling simplifies the problem since only the excitation and relaxation rates , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , between the vibrational ground state and the first excited state are required ( cf .",
    "[ fig_overview](b ) ) . in first - order perturbation theory",
    "these transition rates are given by fermi s golden rule : @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the vibrational ground state and the first excited state respectively , while @xmath43 and @xmath44 denote any of the stationary one - electron states of the tip or the substrate with corresponding fermi - dirac distributions @xmath45\\right\\}$ ] , and @xmath46 denotes the electron - vibration interaction ( eq .",
    "( [ h_ev ] ) ) .",
    "these rates describe the vibrational excitation and relaxation induced by the tunneling electrons .",
    "since the initial and final states of a tunneling electron can be located either in the tip or the substrate , these rates can be decomposed into four different terms : @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , which sum up to give @xmath51 . here , the first ( second ) superscript denotes whether the final ( initial ) state belongs to the surface or the tip .",
    "in contrast to ref .  , we will not assume that the adsorbate local dos is constant over the relevant energy range , but rather we model it by a lorentzian shape , @xmath52 , where @xmath53 , with @xmath54 and @xmath55 describing the coupling between the molecular level and the substrate and tip electronic states , respectively .",
    "using this function , the excitation and relaxation rates can be calculated analytically in the low temperature limit .",

    "the vibrational energies @xmath60 ( _ i.e. _ the size of the steps on the `` vibrational ladder '' ) were determined from the curvature of the calculated potential energy surfaces , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_overview](a ) .",
    "they lie around 19mev for the shallower well of the down - state , and around 40mev for the deeper well of the up - state . the dependence of these vibrational frequencies on the tip ",

    "[ table_full ] are consistent with the potential energy surfaces obtained from dft calculations shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_overview](a ) , which exhibit a highly asymmetric double well , with a shallow well for the down - state and a deep one for the up - state .",
    "the asymmetry increases as the tip - surface separation is reduced . in particular , the depth of the potential well of the up - state ( @xmath61 ) , which according to tab .",
    "[ table_full ] amounts to 0.53ev at 7.3 , agrees quite well with that calculated within dft , whereas the model predicts a down - state well of 0.17ev at 7.3 that is slightly deeper than that derived from the _ ab - initio _ calculations ( cf . fig .",
    "[ fig_overview](a ) ) .",
    "this may be due to the fact that the potentials in fig .",
    "[ fig_overview](a ) were calculated for a single ptcda molecule , whereas in the switching experiments edge molecules were used ; their hydrogen bonds to neighboring molecules will lead to a significant increase of the barrier height .",
    "note , however , that the model does correctly predict the decrease in depth of the down - state well as the tip - surface separation is decreased ; this tendency is due to the reduction of the potential minimum to a saddle point for tip - surface separations of less than about 6.2 ( cf .",
    "[ fig_overview](a ) ) .",
    "a further important parameter in our model for the transfer rate is the position of energy level @xmath63 through which the electron current that causes the vibrational heating passes ( i.e.  the transport level ) , because this influences the energy dependent density of states that enters the rate via eqs .",
    "( [ rate_up ] ) and ( [ rate_down ] ) .",

    "hamiltonian we can only take one transport level into account .",
    "it turns out that the qualitatively different behavior of the two processes surface@xmath10tip and tip@xmath10surface requires the use of two different transport levels , depending on the switching direction .",
    "this is reflected in tab .",
    "[ table_full ] by negative values @xmath65 for the tip@xmath10surface process , while the surface@xmath10tip process has positive @xmath66 values ( the spectral density of the levels @xmath65 and @xmath66 are shown in fig .  [ dos ] ) . in other words",
    ", we have to assume that in the up - state the switching current passes mainly through occupied dos of the junction , whereas in the down - state it passes predominantly through the empty dos of the adsorbed molecule .",
    "note that due to the way in which the bias voltage drops between tip and substrate , both molecular levels @xmath65 and @xmath66 are within the bias window and may in principle contribute to the transport , but in our minimal model we can  as mentioned above  only take one into account at a time .            the fitted values @xmath65 show a clear tendency to move up towards the fermi level as the tip - surface separation",
    "is increased .",
    "this tendency is known very well both from experiment@xcite and dft calculations,@xcite although the precise level positions in experiment and _ ab initio _ theory differ from those in tab .",
    "[ table_full ] .",
    "this is not too surprising since our minimal model only allows for a single lorentzian level whereas the actual density of states is much more complicated .",
    "the fitted values @xmath66 range between 0.24ev and 0.30ev , whereas the dft calculation has this level fixed at 0.2ev .",
    "the small decrease in the transfer rate of the surface@xmath10tip process at about 220mev ( fig .",
    "[ fit_pioa](a ) ) is due to the molecular level @xmath66 entering into resonance with the fermi energy of the stm tip , which leads to a reduction of the vibrational lifetimes of the ptcda molecule in the junction ( _ i.e. _ the rate @xmath67 at which the molecular vibrational energy dissipates into the electrodes is increased , cf .",
    "( a1 , a4 ) ) .",
    "this in turn reduces the transfer rate of the molecule between the surface and the tip . further raising the bias voltage beyond this point results in the transfer rate increasing once again due to non - resonant tunneling .",
    "we stress that this behavior can only be obtained if an energy - dependent dos is used ; a constant dos could not yield such a behavior .",
