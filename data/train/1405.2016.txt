    "the nature of stellar noise related to activity gives rise to aperiodic and/or quasiperiodic variations that can mimic periodic doppler signals of keplerian origin and thus prevent the detections of low - amplitude planetary signals by littering the posterior densities ( or periodograms ) with spurious signals that can be mistaken for genuine signals of planetary origin . in order to increase the sensitivity of radial velocity surveys ,",
    "it is necessary to develop statistical models ( e.g. for correlated noise : * ? ? ?",

    "* ) accounting for these irregular variations .",
    "furthermore , it should only be accepted that a weak planetary signal is detected if it is necessary in describing the radial velocity variations and that these variations can not be explained by stochastic variability that might be connected to measures of stellar activity and/or intrinsic correlations in the data ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "however , determination of the mass of this planet based on high - precision radial velocities has proved difficult ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) due to the difficulties in detecting the signal in the precense of at least equally significant variations related to stellar activity and rotation @xcite and because modelling approaches based on different assumptions and approaches  pre - whitening or high - pass filtering corresponding to the removal of periodicities estimated to correspond to activity - related phenomena @xcite or modelling starspot - induced radial velocity variations @xcite  have provided a wide range of estimates that are consistent at best but sometimes very diverse ( see the estimates listed in * ? ? ?",
    "in this work we obtain the harps spectra of corot-7 from the european southern observatory archive , process them with the _ template - enhanced radial velocity re - analysis application _",
    "( harps - terra ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and obtain velocity products together with activity indicators .",
    "we aim to filter out the activity - related variations from the corot-7 radial velocity data with our noise model .",
    "spurious quasiperiodic signals related to the stellar rotation of roughly 23 d @xcite corresponding to the `` dominant frequency in the power spectrum '' according to @xcite , have been affecting the obtained solutions to the radial velocities .",
    "our goal is the detection of the signal of the transiting planet without any prior knowledge of its orbital period and , more generally , to be able to distinguish between activity - related variability and genuine doppler signals of transiting planets .",
    "stellar activity can contribute considerably to the variations in precision radial velocity data ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is thus necessary to account for these variations with the statistical model in order to detect low - amplitude signals of planetary origin .",
    "our key point is that activity variations are not strictly periodic and comprise quasi- and/or aperiodic variability that is unlikely to be modelled accurately by using keplerian periodicities or sinusoids .",
    "this is the case even when such variations appear as periodicities in the commonly used lomb - scargle periodograms @xcite , although such an interpretation might be tempting in practice ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in the context of so - called `` pre - whitening '' that aims at removing periodogram powers related to activity and/or rotation by subtracting the corresponding sinusoids from the data .",
    "since such variations can not be expected to be strictly sinusoidal , this procedure gives rise to harmonics of the subtracted signals that need to be subtracted as well in order to decrease the contribution of such features to the data .",
    "such an approach can not be considered very satisfactory in practice because such a subtraction of sinusoids that are not orthonormal in the case of unevenly sampled time series causes biases to the genuine signals in the data ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but also , because it requires prior knowledge of the nature of the signals seen in the periodograms , e.g. information from transit observations , such that activity - related spurious signals are subtracted but planetary signals are left intact @xcite .",
    "we note that more sophisticated periodogram - based methods have been proposed as well , including the generalised log - likelihood periodograms ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) that evaluate the significances of signals based on likelihood - ratio tests and can be applied to arbitrary noise models , and the minimum mean squared error technique for determining the optimal number of signals in a data set @xcite that also provides means for testing whether the signals are stationary in time .    instead , we adopt the approach of @xcite and assume that a large fraction of activity - induced variability can in fact be filtered out from the velocities by accounting for intrinsic correlations in the data . in practice , this means that the radial velocity noise is not white but has a significant red - noise component even for stars that are known to be rather inactive @xcite",
    ". however , such models for correlated noise might not be sufficient in explaining the variations in radial velocities of moderately active stars such as corot-7 .",
    "well - known measures of stellar activity , obtained from the same spectra as the velocities themselves , can be useful ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to estimate how much the stellar activity contributes to the radial velocity variability .",
    "in particular , we consider using the line bisector span ( bis ) that respond to spots and other surface inhomogeneities co - rotating on the stellar surface @xcite , line full - width at the half - maximum ( fwhm ) , and the @xmath6-index based on the caii h&k lines as reasonable measures of activity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the above considerations suggest , as a first - order approximation , a model for the radial velocities that can be written ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as @xmath7 where the measurement @xmath8 made at time @xmath9 is modelled by using the reference velocity @xmath10 ; a linear trend quantified by using the parameter @xmath11 that is can be present in the radial velocities of any given target due to the possible existence of a long - period stellar and/or substellar companion ; a white - noise component @xmath12 that we assume to have a gaussian density with a zero mean and a variance of @xmath13 , where @xmath14 represents the estimated instrument noise and @xmath15 is a free parameter of the model ; a correlated noise component that we describe according to a @xmath16th order moving average ( ma ) model with an exponential smoothing in the time - scale of @xmath17 @xcite ; and linear correlations with the activity indices @xmath18 quantified by using the parameters @xmath19 .",
    "although it is possible that the linear correlations between velocities and activity indices described above are not sufficient as the relationship between those two can not be expected to be linear ( or in fact to follow any simple functional description ) , we adopt such a description as a first - order approximation .",
    "while we do not expect this model to be optimal , if velocity variations are indeed impacted by activity this will be better than modelling the velocity variations without such a component .",
    "moreover , the ma(@xmath16 ) term might not be an optimal description of the correlated noise either .",
    "for instance , @xcite and @xcite describe the noise such that they set all @xmath20 equal and take the summation over all @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "we do not consider this a realistical description .",
    "first , such a model corresponds to a violation of causality as the measurements made after the @xmath23th one contribute to its noise , although this might be justifiable as simply a statistical description without such an interpretation .",
    "second , the assumption that the parameter @xmath20 is the same for all @xmath21 might be too restrictive .",
    "furthermore , using such models requires inversions of @xmath24 matrices , where @xmath25 is the number of measurements , which becomes computationally heavy even for moderately high @xmath25 .",
    "we choose an ma(1 ) model that does not increase the computational requirements and appears to be a reasonably good noise model in practice @xcite and because increasing the number of ma components did not improve the model .",
    "moreover , as we measure activity - related information based on three activity indicators , namely bis , fwhm , and @xmath6-indices , we set @xmath26 and @xmath27 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : model ] ) .",
    "the model described in eq .",
    "[ eq : model ] implies a likelihood model for the measurements that can be calculated for the @xmath23th measurement based on the obtained values @xmath28 , where @xmath29 .",
    "we used the priors as discussed in @xcite such that the eccentricity prior was defined as @xmath30 and the jitter prior as @xmath31 , where @xmath32 2 ms@xmath33 .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite for discussion and justification .",
    "we analyse the radial velocity data sets by applying the delayed - rejection adaptive - metropolis ( dram ) algorithm @xcite that is a generalisation of the adaptive - metropolis algorithm @xcite based on the metropolis - hastings algorithm @xcite .",
    "the basics of the dram algorithm are as follows .",
    "we first draw a proposal ( @xmath34 ) from a proposal density @xmath35 .",
    "this density is a function of the current state of the chain @xmath36 ( typically centered at it ) .",
    "the proposal is then accepted with the probability @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the posterior density given the data @xmath39 .",
    "if the proposal density is a symmetric one , as is the case when applying a multivariate gaussian density , the acceptance probability depends only on the posterior ratio of the two vectors because @xmath40 . assuming that the new vector @xmath34 is rejected , another vector @xmath41",
    "can then be proposed by using another proposal density @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "in addition to the current state @xmath36 and the newly proposed vector @xmath41 , this new proposal density can depend on the rejected vector @xmath34 as well .",
    "the new proposal is then accepted with probability @xmath43}{[1 - \\alpha_{1}(\\theta_{0 } , \\theta_{1 } ) ] } \\bigg\\ } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this process can be repeated for an arbitrary number of rejected proposals in the above manner .",
    "the equation for the general case , i.e. @xmath44th acceptance probability , can be found in @xcite .",
    "analyses of radial velocity time series in a search for periodic signals are typically complicated because the period parameter ( its logarithm in our analyses ) has a highly multimodal likelihood function and thus posterior density .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to perform the dram samplings in such a way that the chains visit all the modes in the posterior regularly and that the highest maxima are identified robustly in the samplings .",
    "for this reason , we choose the proposal densities such that @xmath45 is a multivariate gaussian density with a covariance matrix @xmath46 .",
    "the second proposal is then a multivariate gaussian as well with a covariance of @xmath47 that is obtained by multiplying the row and the column corresponding to the period parameter of the signal by a factor of @xmath48 such that the width of the proposal density is decreased in the dimension of the period to enable the chains to find the narrow probability maxima in the period space .",
    "we allowed three delayed - rejection steps before finally rejecting a proposed vector .",
    "such a practice has been proposed by @xcite albeit in a different context .    when searching for periodic signals in the data , we used tempered samplings such that a posterior raised to the power of @xmath49 was used instead of the original posterior .",
    "this ensured , by decreasing the relative heights of the modes in the posterior , that the corresponding markov chains visited all the relevant areas in the period space .",
    "this is important because the posterior density is typically highly multimodal in such examples of analyses of radial velocity data ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "dram samplings were not used to obtain point and uncertainty estimates for the model parameters but only for ensuring that there were no additional significant maxima in the period space . for parameter estimation purposes ,",
    "we set @xmath50 to draw samples from the original posterior density with the adaptive - metropolis algorithm .",
    "the corot-7 doppler data have been obtained over two rather distinct observing runs between 2454527 - 2454885 jd and between 2455939 - 2455965 jd .",
    "we call these simply the first ( @xmath51 after removing few measurements corresponding to fwhm outliers ) and second observing run ( @xmath52 ) , respectively .",
    "these velocities are tabulated in the appendix . because there is a gap of almost three years between these two observing runs",
    ", we believe that it can not be expected that the noise properties , including all possible correlations as modelled according to eq . ( [ eq : model ] ) , are equivalent in these runs due to differences in stellar activity , e.g. the evolution of spot patterns , and the designs of the observations in terms of e.g. cadence and exposure time .",
    "therefore , we assume that the noise parameters of these two observing runs are independent of one another .",
    "even if they are not strictly independent , we believe that treating them as free parameters for each run , as one would for data from different instruments , enables us to determine whether there are indeed differences that should be accounted for and to obtain a better statistical model than when making the much stronger assumption that the noise properties were not evolving as a function of time , which is unlikely to be the case ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "due to this choice , our model contains eight independent and two common parameters for the two observing runs , which yields a baseline model with 18 parameters when there are no keplerian signals in the model .",
    "we started the analyses of the harps velocity data by performing tempered samplings of a one - keplerian model .",
    "these samplings enabled us to identify a signal at 3.7 d as a unique probability maximum in the period space together with local maxima corresponding to its double and a daily alias at a period of 1.4 d ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dram_searches ] , right hand panel ) .",
    "similar samplings , albeit with parameter @xmath53 set to values closer to unity , of a two - keplerian model yielded a maximum at a period of 9.0 d for the second signal ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dram_searches ] middle panel ) together with local maxima at 0.86 d and 22 d. after this , additional samplings revealed a unique third signal in the data at a period of 0.86 d ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dram_searches ] , right hand panel ) without considerable local maxima .",
    "this sequence of signal detections was consistent with the signal detection criteria of @xcite as the log - bayesian evidences were increased at these steps by 43.0 , 13.2 , and 19.0 .",
    "these log - bayesian evidences correspond to model probabilities that increase by factors of @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 , respectively , when assuming equal prior probabilities for each model .",
    "the phase - folded signals are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : signals ] .",
    "we did not detect any additional signals in the data .",
    "the observed rotation period of the star of 23 d that has been detected in the radial velocities in earlier studies @xcite did not correspond to the global maximum for any of the models used in our analyses .",
    "although it can be seen as a local maximum in the dram search for the second most significant signal ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dram_searches ] , middle panel ) , it did not correspond to a significant solution even when we started additional samplings in its vicinity . furthermore",
    ", we did not observe significant signals at that period even after accounting for the three candidate planets orbiting the star .",
    "this indicates that the statistical model ( eq . [ eq : model ] ) accounts for the aperiodic and quasiperiodic variations corresponding to the stellar activity sufficiently well and makes it unnecessary to model the rotation period ( and/or its harmonics ) as additional signals in the data @xcite .",
    "we interpret this result as a suggestion that the noise model is an adequate description of the activity - related variations and , more generally , that it might be possible to remove such variability from radial velocity data of at most moderately active stars .",
    "this could therefore help in the detection of low amplitude radial velocity variations corresponding to low - mass planets around such stars .",
    "we did not find significant correlations between the radial velocities and bis values or the @xmath6-indices .",
    "however , the fwhm appears to be connected to the velocity variations as we obtain @xmath57 0.094 [ 0.016 , 0.198 ] for the first observing run and",
    "@xmath57 0.065 [ -0.013 , 0.192 ] for the second when using the maximum a posteriori ( map ) estimates and the 99% credibility intervals .",
    "the former correlation is significantly present in the data considering that the 99% interval does not overlap with zero but the latter is significant in this sense with respect to only a 95% credibility interval .    the excess noise , as measured by obtaining estimates for the parameters @xmath58 , is likely different between the two observing runs .",
    "we obtained estimates of 3.89 [ 3.07 , 4.97 ] ms@xmath33 and 1.88 [ 1.42 , 3.21 ] ms@xmath33 for the first and second observing runs , respectively .",
    "similarly , the first observing run contained significant intrinsic correlations because we obtained @xmath59 0.88 [ 0.68 , 1 ] , whereas the same parameter was consistent with zero for the second observing run .",
    "the time - scale ( @xmath17 ) of these intrinsic correlations was found to be roughly 6 d ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "not accounting for these differences might weight the first observing run too much and the second one too little and lead to biased results ."
