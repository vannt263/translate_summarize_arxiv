    "except for the radio galaxies m87 and centaurus a , all 27 currently known very high energy ( vhe , @xmath0 gev ) @xmath1-ray emitting active galactic nuclei ( agns ) are blazars,@xcite assumed to have a close alignment of their highly relativistic outflows ( jets ) with our line of sight . their spectral energy distributions ( seds ) are characterized by a synchrotron peak at optical to x - ray energies , and a second peak at gev to tev energies .",
    "the latter can be either due to inverse - compton ( ic ) emission from accelerated electrons , which up - scatter synchrotron photons to high energies.@xcite in hadronic models , instead , interactions of the jet outflow with ambient matter , proton - induced cascades , or synchrotron radiation off protons , are responsible for the high - energy photons.@xcite another defining property of blazars is the high variability of their emission .",
    "for some vhe @xmath1-ray blazars , also correlations between the x - ray and @xmath1-ray emission were established on various time scales.@xcite for sources with a large angle between the jet and the line of sight ( e.g. , the radio galaxy m  87 ) , classical ic scenarios can not account for the vhe @xmath1-ray emission .",
    "models that depend less critically on beaming effects are required instead.@xcite",
    "magic@xcite is currently the largest ( 17m -  ) single - dish imaging air cerenkov telescope .",
    "its energy range spans from 5060  gev up to tens of tev .",
    "magic is sensitive to @xmath2  1.6% of the crab nebula flux in 50 observing hours .",
    "operation during moderate moonshine extends its duty cycle substantially,@xcite which is particularly important for observing variable @xmath1-ray sources like agns .",
    "a second magic telescope@xcite is going to be operational from april 2009 on . by stereoscopic observations ,",
    "the sensitivity of magic phase ii is increased considerably .",
    "magic detected a strong 9.9-@xmath3 signal from m87 from 2008 january 30 to 2008 february 11.@xcite the highest flux ( 15% that of the crab nebula ) was recorded on 2008 february 1 at a significance of 8.0 @xmath3 .    our analysis revealed no variability in the 150350 gev range , while a variable ( significance : 5.6@xmath3 ) @xmath1-ray flux above 350 gev on night - to - night basis confirmed the @xmath4 variability reported earlier.@xcite the variability restricts the vhe emission region to a size of @xmath5 ( doppler factor @xmath6 ) , and suggests the core of m87 rather than hst-1 , the brightest knot in the m87 jet , as the origin of the @xmath1-rays .",
    "the rapid variability alone can not dismiss hst-1 as possible origin of the tev photons . in early 2008 , however , hst-1 was at a low x - ray flux level , whereas the luminosity of the m87 core was at a historical maximum.@xcite to further elucidate the location of the vhe emission , the h.e.s.s . , veritas , and magic collaborations performed an extensive campaign on m87 in 2007/8.@xcite    for the first time , the energy spectrum below 250 gev could be assessed .",
    "the hardness of the spectrum , described by a power law with a spectral index @xmath7 is unique among the vhe agns , which show either curved or softer spectra .",
    "no high - energy cut - off was found , but a marginal spectral hardening , which may be interpreted as a similarity to the vhe blazars , where such hardening has often been observed.@xcite",
    "during a high - flux phase of mkn 501 in summer 2005 , this blazar revealed rapid flux changes with doubling times as short as 3 minutes or less.@xcite for the 2005 july 9 flare , a time delay ( zero - delay probability of @xmath8 ) between the flare peaks at different @xmath1-ray energies of @xmath9 towards higher energies was found.@xcite such a delay can be produced by a gradual acceleration of the underlying electron population.@xcite other explanations are the observation of the initial acceleration phase of a relativistic blob in the jet@xcite or , within an ssc scenario , a brief episode of increased particle injection.@xcite an energy - dependent speed of photons in vacuum,@xcite as predicted in some models of quantum gravity,@xcite can also result in a delay : when assuming a simultaneous emission of the @xmath1-rays ( of different energies ) at the source , a lower limit of @xmath10  gev ( 95% c.l . ) , among the best from time - of - flight measurements,@xcite can be established,@xcite which increases further if any delay towards higher energies in the source is present .",
    "observations following high optical states of potential vhe blazars have proven very successful@xcite with the detection of mkn 180 , 1es 1011 + 496 , and recently s50716 + 71 .",
    "the 18.7-h observation of 1es 1011 + 496 was triggered by an optical outburst in march 2007 , resulting in a 6.2-@xmath3 detection@xcite at @xmath11 .",
    "an indication for a long - term optical ",
    "vhe correlation is given , in that in spring 2007 the vhe @xmath1-ray flux was @xmath12% higher than in spring 2006 , when magic had observed this blazar for the first time.@xcite    in april 2008 , the supporting optical kva telescope reported a bright optical state of the blazar s5  0716 + 71 , triggering vhe observations , which resulted in a 6.8-@xmath3 detection , corresponding to a flux of @xmath13 .",
    "the source was also in a high x - ray state.@xcite",
    "magic observed the region around 3c  66a for 54.2h in fall 2007 , resulting in the discovery@xcite of the @xmath1-ray source magic  j0223 + 430 at ( ra , dec ) = ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) , coinciding with the catalog position of 3c  66b , a nearby ( @xmath16 ) fanaroff - riley type i radiogalaxy .",
    "3c  66a , @xmath17 away from the detected excess , can be excluded statistically as being the @xmath1-ray source with a probability of 95.6% .",
    "when allowing for a systematic pointing uncertainty of @xmath18 , the exclusion probability is 85.4% .",
    "the @xmath1-ray flux was found to be constant on the level of 2.2% the crab nebula flux .",
    "the energy spectrum of magic  j0223 + 430 extends from 75 gev to 3 tev , following a power law with a photon index of @xmath19 .",
    "given the likely association of magic  j0223 + 430 with 3c  66b , our detection would establish radio galaxies as a new vhe @xmath1-ray source class . in view of the recent detection of 3c  66a as vhe @xmath1-rays emitter,@xcite",
    "we note that if 3c  66a was emitting @xmath1-rays in 2007 august to december , then its flux was at a significantly lower level than in 2008 .",
    "also it can not be excluded@xcite that the observed spectrum is a combination of emission from 3c  66b ( dominating at @xmath20gev ) and 3c  66a ( at lower energies ) . given the measured spectral index , in the improbable case that the _ total _ signal originates from 3c  66a , the redshift of this blazar is likely to be significantly lower than previously assumed@xcite ( @xmath21 and 0.321 ) .",
    "vhe @xmath1-rays were detected from 3c  279 at a 5.77-@xmath3 post - trial significance on 2006 february 23 , supported by a marginal signal on the preceding night.@xcite a zero - flux lightcurve of the full 10-day observation can be rejected on the 5.04-@xmath3 level .",
    "this makes 3c 279 at @xmath22 the most distant vhe @xmath1-ray source .",
    "the observed vhe spectrum can be described by a power law with a differential spectral index of @xmath23 between @xmath24gev .",
    "it is sensitive to the extragalactic background light@xcite ( ebl ) between @xmath25 .",
    "the reconstructed intrinsic spectrum is difficult to reconcile with models predicting high ebl densities ( e.g. , the fast - evolution model in ref . ) , while low - level models@xcite are still viable . assuming a maximum intrinsic photon index of @xmath26 , an upper ebl limit was inferred,@xcite leaving a small allowed region for the ebl . the results support , at higher redshift , indications@xcite that _ hubble space telescope _ and _ spitzer _ data correctly estimate most of the background light in the universe .",
