    "graphene , a novel two - dimensional form of carbon,@xcite displays exciting new physics , distinct from that of the two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) .",
    "a striking example in the presence of a magnetic field is the anomalous integer quantum hall effect , which has been observed at room temperature.@xcite the treatment of electronic interactions is also challenging in graphene , due to the structure and symmetry of the dispersion relations at the two inequivalent dirac points .",
    "when scattering between these points is negligible , the chirality of the electrons results in a suppression of backscattering.@xcite this together with graphene s reduced level of defects and impurities , makes it highly efficient at charge transport and a promising candidate for use in nanotechnology.@xcite however , in order for this potential to be realized , we need to better understand the precise nature of defects in graphene .",
    "optical measurements are a particularly useful tool for probing this.@xcite         in this paper , we study the _ magneto - optical _ response of graphene in a strong perpendicular magnetic field in the presence of a low density of charged impurities . infrared studies of landau level ( ll ) transitions have reported significant departures from the bare ( non - interacting ) cyclotron resonance.@xcite whether this can be attributed solely to interaction effects and a possible role of disorder remains unclear . here",
    "we develop a general formalism for studying localized collective modes of magnetoplasmon and spin - wave types and determine their optical signatures .",
    "we treat the electron - electron ( @xmath3-@xmath3 ) interactions beyond the conventional mean - field / rpa level and the electron - impurity interaction exactly in the high magnetic field regime .",
    "our results are robust for a range of impurity screening strengths .",
    "we establish the existence of an exact symmetry for collective excitations , which should be observable by magneto - optical spectroscopy.@xcite this symmetry , briefly speaking , connects the magneto - optical _",
    "electron_-like excitations of , e.g.  a _ positively _ charged donor @xmath0 , with _",
    "excitations for a _ negatively _ charged acceptor @xmath1 .",
    "this duality is a consequence of the electron - hole symmetry between single - particle states in the lower and upper cones of graphene.@xcite furthermore , we establish exact optical selection rules , which demonstrate that the `` dual '' collective excitations with total angular momenta @xmath4 are active in two different circular polarizations @xmath5 and , besides having the same energies , exhibit the same oscillator strengths .",
    "therefore , a qualitative distinction of graphene from the conventional 2deg,@xcite is that there are strong dipole - allowed transitions in _ both _ circular polarizations sensitive to the charge of impurity .",
    "we show an example of this symmetry for the lowest ll @xmath6 in fig .",
    "[ fig - emz ] .",
    "each ll in graphene consists of four sublevels , due to spin and valley ( pseudospin ) splitting .",
    "we denote by @xmath7 a many - electron ground state corresponding to the sublevel filling factor @xmath8 of a particular ll .",
    "for sublevels @xmath9 of ll with number @xmath10 , the eigenstates and eigenenergies of excitations localized on the @xmath0 with @xmath11 , coincide precisely with those with @xmath12 formed at filling factor @xmath13 of the ll with number @xmath14 , localized on the @xmath1 .",
    "this effect represents what remains of the electron - hole symmetry after it has been broken by a charged impurity .",
    "we consider collective excitations in a system of electrons interacting via a screened coulomb potential @xmath15 [ ] in the presence of an additional external field @xmath16 .",
    "all the results presented here are for a coulomb impurity , @xmath17,@xcite but the method is applicable for any non - singular axially symmetric potential @xmath18 . the parameters @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the effective dielectric constants for @xmath3-@xmath3 interaction and electron - impurity screening,@xcite respectively . a composite index @xmath21 is used to designate the ll number @xmath10 , the spin @xmath22 , and pseudospin @xmath23 projections .",
    "low - energy collective excitations correspond to the promotion of one electron from one of the uppermost filled levels @xmath24 to a higher lying empty level @xmath25 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - emz ] ) .",
    "electrons in graphene follow a linear dispersion relation close to the zeroes of energy ( dirac points ) , which occur at two inequivalent points in the brillouin zone , the @xmath26 and @xmath27 valleys.@xcite we describe a perpendicular magnetic field @xmath28 by the symmetric gauge @xmath29 , consistent with the axial symmetry of @xmath18 . a single electron wavefunction in , e.g.  the @xmath30 valley ( pseudospin @xmath31 ) , is a four - component spinor @xmath32 here",

    ", there are sixteen possible inter - ll excitations involving the @xmath6 ll as an initial or final state and which have single particle energies of magnitude @xmath78 . here",
    "we concentrate on the four excitations for which no spin or pseudospin - flip occurs ( see the insets in fig .",
    "[ fig - emz ] ) , as these are the only excitations which are optically dipole active .",
    "these have the same single particle energy @xmath79 and , therefore , are strongly ( resonantly ) mixed .",
    "let us discuss some general features of our approach . in the absence of an external potential",
    "all magnetoplasmon states are extended and the corresponding hamiltonian matrix is infinite , see eq.([hamd ] ) .",
    "the magnetoplasmons can be labeled by a continuous quasimomentum @xmath80 and their eigenenergies fill a band of width @xmath81.@xcite in the presence of an impurity , however , some states become localized .",
    "importantly , the basis states are localized two - particle orbitals whose distances from the impurity increase @xmath82.@xcite hence , for localized excitations the scheme is convergent so that the basis can be truncated .",
    "we include the first @xmath83 basis states for each excitation @xmath84 with the total matrix size being @xmath85 for four strongly mixed excitations .",
    "the achieved accuracy in eigenergies of bound states is better than @xmath86 .",
    "figure  [ fig - emz](a ) shows for @xmath87 four low - energy branches of magnetoplasmons bound on the @xmath0 for @xmath88 ; two of these branches are degenerate .        for large positive @xmath11 ,",
    "the hole is on average much farther from the impurity than the electron , see eq .  .",
    "therefore , the @xmath89-@xmath0 attraction dominates over the @xmath90-@xmath0 and @xmath3-@xmath70 interactions . generally ,",
    "for an excitation with the electron in the @xmath91 ll , we find branches with asymptotic @xmath92 energies equal to @xmath93 , when counted from the corresponding renormalized cyclotron energy . as an example , notice the three branches approaching energy @xmath94 and the single branch approaching zero energy in fig .",
    "[ fig - emz](a ) .",
    "these originate , respectively , from the three @xmath95 transitions ( denoted hereafter as @xmath96 ) and from the single @xmath63 transition for @xmath97 .",
    "similar asymptotic behavior can be seen for other filling factors .",
    "the high - energy ( i.e. , above the band ) magnetoplasmons develop for @xmath98 , when the hole is on average closer to the @xmath0 than the electron .",

    "the spectra of bound states are qualitatively similar to those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - emz ] . for @xmath103",
    ", the states can be classified according to the total spin and pseudospin , so the states are either spin and pseudospin singlets or triplets.@xcite only spin and pseudospin singlets are optically active .",
    "let us consider the magneto - optical response in graphene.@xcite in the electric dipole approximation , the interaction of electrons with light of frequency @xmath104 and left ( @xmath105 ) and right ( @xmath106 ) circular polarizations is described by the hamiltonian @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the electric field amplitude and @xmath109 are the pauli matrices acting in the space of the graphene crystal sublattices .",
    "the exact optical selection rules for the collective excitations that follow are : only those with no spin or pseudospin flips and with @xmath4 and @xmath110 are optically active in the two circular polarizations @xmath111 .",
    "we quantify the rate of microwave absorption in the @xmath111 polarization by calculating the dipole transition matrix elements @xmath112 to final states of magnetoplasmons obtained by numerical diagonalization .",
    "figure  [ fig - enu ] shows optical properties of states bound on @xmath0 for the @xmath113 and @xmath114 polarizations .",
    "the results for the @xmath1 at @xmath100 can be obtained from those reported here with the change @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "two types of localized states can be optically observed : ( i ) truly bound states , which are split off the continuum and have normalizable wavefunctions , ( ii ) quasibound states within the continuum , which have high probability amplitudes on the impurity and long - range oscillating tails .",
    "the latter may exhibit _ asymmetric _ fano - type optical signatures.@xcite    for both polarizations , the upper branch originates mostly from the @xmath63 transitions with some small ( zero at @xmath103 ) admixture of the @xmath96 . with increasing @xmath8 , the number of @xmath63 transitions increases , which leads to the enhanced contribution of the repulsive @xmath3-@xmath70 exchange interactions",
    "this explains the _ blue shift _ of the upper branch to higher energies with increasing @xmath8 . also , its optical strength @xmath117 increases ( fig .",
    "[ fig - enu]a ) while @xmath118 decreases ( fig .  [ fig - enu]b ) .",
    "this is explained by the fact that in the @xmath113 ( @xmath114 ) polarization only the electron - like @xmath63 ( hole - like @xmath96 ) transitions are optically active .     for the @xmath0 in @xmath113 polarization for @xmath99 .",

    "screening was shown to be relevant in graphene,@xcite although the situation is not yet fully understood , particularly for a strong magnetic field .",
    "coulomb impurities with charge @xmath119 belong to the subcritical regime and hence screening effects due to the substrate and the electron system in graphene can be modelled via an effective charge @xmath120,@xcite or by an effective dielectric constant @xmath20 .",
