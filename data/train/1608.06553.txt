    "one of the most popular explanations of accelerated expansion of the universe is that it is caused by some scalar field , for which the strong condition of energy domination is nt satisfied : @xmath0 .",
    "different models of scalar field are considered : quintessence , phantom , quintom , tachyon and other more exotic models of scalar field ( see for example , @xcite and citations there in ) . to describe its impact on expansion of the universe or other components the hydrodynamics approximation is used -",
    "the field represented by some ideal fluid with equation of state @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is called the parameter of equation of state . in the simplest case",
    "the quantity @xmath3 is a constant , but there are more general models , where parameter of equation of state changes with time . beside this , there are models , in which scalar field non - gravitationally interacts with other fields @xcite . in the lagrangian of scalar field and fields with which it interacts the additional term appears . in the general case",
    "this lagrangian can be written in the form : @xmath4 , where @xmath5 - kinetic term of field , @xmath6 - the variable of scalar field , which is the dark energy , @xmath7 - the fields of other types of matter .",
    "in general , the form of @xmath8 is unknown .",
    "there are no any physical principle or any experimental data , from which it is possible to derive the lagrangian of interaction of scalar field of dark energy with other fields yet . nowadays ,",
    "the attempts to build unified theory of field are being made , and the scalar field some how must be coupled with other fields .",
    "one can read about possibility of such interaction and observational data which points on it in works @xcite .",
    "below we analyse the impact of non - gravitational interaction between dark energy and dark matter on the dynamics of the expansion of the universe and on the evolution of the densities of these components . as we do nt know the form of the lagrangian of scalar field we describe its behaviour phenomenologically .",
    "evolution of homogeneous and isotropic universe and its components are described by system of einstein s equations and by equations which express the conservation laws of energy and momentum considering additional interaction between components .",
    "we assume that dark energy interacts gravitationally and non - gravitationally with dark matter only and interacts gravitationally only with baryonic matter or relativistic matter .",
    "all components are described by ideal fluid approximation . as the basis we took the model of dark energy @xcite which had been studied as minimally coupled , which gives the possibility to distinguish the impact of interaction between dark components on dynamics of the expansion of the universe and evolution of their densities .",
    "the following features have been generally accepted as properties of the observational universe : homogeneity , isotropy , flatness of 3-space and the accelerated expansion at large scales .",
    "the metric of 4-space of such world is the friedmann - lemaitre - robertson - walker metric ( flrw ) , which in comoving spherical coordinates in conformal representation have such form : @xmath9,\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the diagonal metric tensor with only one unknown function @xmath11 , the scale factor , which describes the expansion of the universe .",
    "hereafter indices @xmath12 take the values 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , where @xmath13-component will be always a time variable . in the model of universe with zero curvature of 3-space",
    "it is convenient to normalize it by 1 at the present epoch : @xmath14 .",
    "the first and second time derivatives of this factor describe the rate and the acceleration of the expansion of the universe , i.e. the dynamics of such expansion .",
    "the variable @xmath15 is conformal time , which is related with physical cosmological time @xmath16 by the simple differential relation : @xmath17 , @xmath18 - the speed of light .",
    "the large set of independent observational data ( see the chapter 1 in the book @xcite ) indicates that @xmath19 and @xmath20 , or in conformal time @xmath21 and @xmath22 , hereafter the dot denotes the derivative @xmath23 . traditionally in cosmology the expansion rate of the universe",
    "is described by relative quantity @xmath24 , which is called the hubble parameter , and the acceleration by the dimensionless quantity @xmath25 , which is called the deceleration parameter : @xmath26 the equations for them are given by the einstein s equations ( 1915 ) , which in general case have the form @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the ricci tensor of covariant curvature , @xmath29 is its convolution , the scalar of 4-space curvature and @xmath30 is the total covariant energy - momentum tensor of the components of the universe .",
    "we specify the energy - momentum tensor in the following way : consider that the universe is uniformly filled by non - relativistic matter - baryonic matter ( @xmath31 ) and dark matter ( @xmath32 ) , relativistic one ( @xmath33 ) - cosmic microwave background and relict neutrino , and also dark energy ( @xmath34 ) . each of it will be described by energy - momentum tensor of ideal fluid , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the ( energy ) density of @xmath37-component , @xmath38 - its pressure , and @xmath39 - 4-vector of velocity .",
    "then the einstein s equations give the equations for @xmath24 and @xmath25 @xmath40 called the friedmann equations . hereafter the variables , in which @xmath41 , was used .",
    "to solve those equations one would need to specify the equations of state of each component and non - gravitational interaction between them , if such is present .",
    "lets take the equation of state in the form @xmath42 , with the given known parameters of equation of state for non - relativistic and relativistic components ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) and unknown for dark energy @xmath45",
    ". we shall find it for scalar - field dark energy from the condition that the ratio of variations of pressure to density is constant and from specific form of non - gravitational interaction with dark matter .",
    "to find the dependencies of densities on time @xmath15 ( or on scale factor @xmath46 ) the equations ( [ h2])-([qh2 ] ) must be complemented by the conservation equations for each component . in general case ,",
    "if there is any other interaction between components besides gravitational one , the equations of conservation of energy and momentum will be written in such form : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the 4-vector of the change of density flow of energy - momentum to / from component @xmath37 as the result of interaction with other components , and `` ; '' - denotes the covariant derivative with respect to @xmath49 .",
    "for minimally coupled components @xmath50 .",
    "the second equation in ( [ jin ] ) is the result of bianchi identities .",
    "hereafter we will suppose that non - gravitational interaction is present only between dark energy and dark matter , so the non - zeros are only @xmath51 - for dark energy and @xmath52 - for dark matter .",
    "from the second equation in ( [ jin ] ) it follows that @xmath53 then the conservation laws for dark energy and dark matter will be written in following form : @xmath54 for baryonic matter and relativistic matter the conservation laws will be with zero flow of energy - momentum , caused by interaction , because we shall analyse the dynamics of expansion of universe in the epoch after recombination , when their motion is free and they interact only gravitationally : @xmath55 the conservation equations ( [ tei_dedm ] ) and ( [ tei_br ] ) for homogeneous isotropic universe contain only the equations of discontinuity , which in the metrics ( [ ds ] ) have the form @xmath56 since the universe is homogeneous and isotropic on large scales and the perturbations are absent , the 4-vector of energy - momentum flow @xmath57 has only one non - zero component @xmath58 - the change of energy density per unit time .",
    "similarly to ( [ eq de ] ) and ( [ eq dm ] ) the equations for baryonic and relativistic components with zero right hand side give the well known expressions : @xmath59 , @xmath60 , hereafter up or down index ( 0 ) will mean the quantity at the present epoch .",
    "now let us consider the dependence of parameter of equation of state @xmath61 on scale factor @xmath46 .",
    "for this we shall introduce the new parameter - the adiabatic speed of sound @xmath62 .",
    "then , using equation ( [ eq de ] ) , we shall obtain such differential equation for @xmath63 : @xmath64 in general case the quantity @xmath65 can depend on time , which must be given or obtained from known or given other physical properties of dark energy . in this work we shall consider it as constant : @xmath66 @xcite",
    ". this equation must be solved together with equations ( [ eq de ] ) , ( [ eq dm ] ) , but for this the @xmath58 must be given or to derived from some considerations ( see the reviews @xcite ) .",
    "as we do nt know anything about such interaction , it is naturally to suggest that it is a function of energies of these two components : @xmath67 for small values of densities it can be represented as @xmath68 where @xmath69 - the constants , which give the strength and sign of interaction .",
    "we suppose , that interaction between dark energy and dark matter must nt depend on the expansion rate of the universe and conformal time @xmath15 explicitly .",
    "therefore the expression for interaction @xmath58 we took in the form ( [ jahf ] ) and ( [ jah ] ) with factor @xmath70 , which removes the explicit dependence of interaction between dark components on the hubble parameter @xmath24 and the conformal time @xmath15 , as such factor is present in the right hand side of equations ( [ eq de ] ) , ( [ eq dm ] ) .",
    "this is obviously , if one switches from the differentiation with respect to @xmath15 to the differentiation with respect to @xmath46 in these equations : @xmath71 the change of dark components energy densities in this case is described by integral - differential equation , which can be solved numerically . in this article",
    "we consider only some partial cases of such interaction , for which the analytical solutions exist : @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the critical density at present epoch . the component s densities at present epoch are convenient to represent in the units of critical one with the dimensionless parameter of density @xmath74 : @xmath75 .    in literature also",
    "the other kinds of interactions are considered , in particular , @xmath76 , where @xmath6 is the dark energy scalar field .",
    "it can be rewritten in the form @xmath77 , where @xmath78 now depends on @xmath46 .",
    "the models with such interaction and interaction ( [ jdm ] ) are considered in @xcite .",
    "further we shall consider the three cases of interaction ( [ j0 ] ) , ( [ jde ] ) and ( [ jdm ] ) between dark energy and dark matter ( the de - dm interaction ) , which are reduced to analytical solutions of conservation equations ( [ eq de ] ) and ( [ eq dm ] ) for energy densities de and dm and the equation ( [ dw ] ) for equation of state parameter of dark energy .",
    "henceforth we shall call the dark energy as quintessence , if its density decreases in the process of expansion of universe , and the dark energy , the density of which increases in the process of expansion of universe - the phantom .",
    "consider the interaction ( [ j0 ] ) , which does not depend on the densities of dark components . in this case from equations ( [ eq de ] ) and ( [ dw ] ) for arbitrary @xmath79 we obtain @xmath80 and as the result we have obtained such equation for @xmath61 : @xmath81 this is the riccati equation , which has the partial solution : @xmath82 .",
    "with its help we find the general solution : @xmath83}{(1+w_0)\\omega_{de}-(w_0-c_a^2)\\omega_{de}a^{3(1+c_{a}^{2 } ) }    + \\alpha(1-a^{3(1+c_{a}^{2})})}-1.\\ ] ] one can see , that the character of equation of state parameter s evolution depends on the values of all parameters of dark energy and parameter of interaction @xmath84 .",
    "moreover , if @xmath85 , then @xmath61 goes to @xmath86 , the equation of state parameter of minimally coupled dark energy @xcite : @xmath87 thus , the introduction of the even simplest interaction have changed the character of equation of state parameter s evolution significantly , which can be found from the comparison of fig .",
    "[ fig : rcr1 ] with fig . 1 in @xcite and fig . 1 in @xcite .",
    "in particular , the quintessence dark energy can gain in the future such properties , in which @xmath88 , while remaining the quintessence , namely such that density of which decreases in the process of expansion of the universe . and vice versa for phantom . considering ( [ rw ] ) and ( [ wc ] ) the conservation equations ( [ eq de ] ) and ( [ eq dm ] ) have exact analytical solutions : @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the known solution for minimally coupled dark energy ( @xmath91 ) @xmath92 which is smooth function of @xmath46 for the arbitrary parameters @xmath93 and @xmath94 @xcite .",
    "the solutions ( [ r de0 ] ) and ( [ r dm0 ] ) are also the smooth functions for @xmath95 and arbitrary parameters of dark energy .",
    "they allow the negative values of density of dark components for certain values of parameters of dark energy and the parameter of interaction .",
    "the condition of positivity of density of dark matter for all @xmath46 is @xmath96 .",
    "the conditions of positivity of density of quintessence dark energy for all @xmath46 are @xmath97 , and of phantom - @xmath98 .",
    "thereby , the interaction ( [ j0 ] ) provides the positive values of density of dark components only in the range of values of parameter of interaction @xmath99 in the models with quintessence and phantom dark energy accordingly .",
