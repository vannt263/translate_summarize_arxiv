    "galactic x - ray sources that contain accreting black holes are among the most interesting objects in high energy astrophysics .",
    "an x - ray source is classified as a black hole x - ray binary ( bhxb ) if the observed mass function , or other less direct dynamical evidence , places the mass of the compact object above @xmath1 ( examples are a0620@xmath000 , 4u 1543@xmath047 , v404 cyg , nova muscae 1991 , gro j1655@xmath040 , gs 2000 + 251 , cyg x-1 , gro j0422 + 32 , h1705@xmath0250 and lmc x-3 ) , or if the spectral and temporal characteristics of the source are similar to those of the well established bhxbs ( e.g. gx 339@xmath04 , 1e 1740.7@xmath02942 , grs 1915 + 105 , gro j1719@xmath024 ) .",
    "recent reviews of this subject are given by tanaka & lewin ( 1995 ) , tanaka & shibazaki ( 1996 ) , and liang ( 1997 ) .",
    "bhxbs are known to exhibit five distinct x - ray spectral states , distinguished by the presence or absence of a soft blackbody component at @xmath2 kev and the luminosity and spectral slope of emission at harder energies .",
    "systems in the _ low / hard state _ have hard power - law spectra with a photon index @xmath3 , an exponential cutoff around 100 kev , and no ( or only weak ) evidence of a soft thermal component . on the other hand , _ high / soft state _",
    "spectra are dominated by a blackbody component with a characteristic temperature @xmath2 kev ( tanaka & shibazaki 1996 ) . at higher energies ,",
    "high state spectra show a power - law tail , softer than in the low state ( @xmath4 ) , but often extending above 500 kev without an obvious turnover . of these two spectral states ,",
    "the high state is generally more luminous , with @xmath5 , while systems in the low state have x - ray luminosities below @xmath6 ( e.g. nowak 1995 ) ; this trend is of course based on systems for which distance and black hole mass estimates are available .",
    "recently , _ intermediate state _",
    "spectra have been seen in several systems ( e.g. nova muscae , ebisawa et al .",
    "1994 ; gx 399@xmath04 , mendez & van der klis 1997 ; cyg x-1 , belloni et al .",
    "1996 ) , which , as the name suggests , are intermediate both in spectral shape and luminosity between the high and low state spectra .",
    "two other spectral states have been seen in some bhxbs .",
    "at least two sources , nova muscae and gx 339@xmath04 ( ebisawa et al . 1994 ; miyamoto et al 1991 ) , have been observed in the _ very high state _",
    ", with luminosities close to the eddington limit .",
    "this state has similar spectral properties as the high state , but is characterized by higher bolometric luminosity and more prominent hard tail , stronger variability and the presence of @xmath7 hz qpos ( e.g. van der klis 1994 ; gilfanov et al .",
    "in addition , all transient bhxbs ( e.g. nova muscae , a0620@xmath000 , v404 cyg ) spend most of their time in a _ quiescent / off state _ , characterized by a very low x - ray flux ( e.g. mcclintock , horne & remillard 1995 ; narayan , barret & mcclintock 1997a ; narayan , garcia & mcclintock 1997b ) .    in the past several decades x - ray and @xmath8-ray observations",
    "have considerably improved our understanding of bhxbs , and significant progress has been made in theoretical modeling of different spectral states .",
    "it has been generally accepted that the soft thermal component originates in an optically thick , geometrically thin accretion disk ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ; novikov & thorne 1973 ) , while the power - law high energy emission is produced by comptonization of soft photons in a hot corona ( e.g. shapiro , lightman , & eardley 1976 ; haardt et al .",
    "1993 ; melia & misra 1993 ) . however , the spatial relationship between the hot and cold medium in the accretion flow has until recently been unclear .",
    "narayan , mcclintock & yi ( 1996 ) and narayan et al.(1997a ) showed that to produce the observed optical and x - ray emission in quiescent soft x - ray transients ( sxts ) , the accreting gas must be primarily in the form of an optically thin hot flow which extends out to a large radius , of order several thousand schwarzschild radii ; beyond this radius , the accretion occurs via a thin disk .",
    "these authors modeled the hot accreting gas as an optically thin advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) .",
    "this is an accretion solution which was discovered by ichimaru ( 1977 ) and rees et al .",
    "( 1982 ) , and then rediscovered and further studied by narayan & yi ( 1994 , 1995a , 1995b ) , abramowicz et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , chen ( 1995 ) , chen et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and others .",
    "hot optically thin adafs exist only below a certain critical accretion rate , @xmath9 in eddington scaled - units . because the density of the gas is low",
    ", the flow is unable to cool efficiently . instead ,",
    "most of the viscously dissipated energy is stored in the gas as thermal energy of the gas particles and is advected into the black hole through the event horizon . as a result ,",
    "the radiative efficiency of an adaf around a black hole is significantly lower than that of a standard thin disk .",
    "this makes the adaf model especially appropriate for modeling under - luminous quiescent systems .    the model proposed by narayan et al .",
    "( 1996 , 1997a ) for quiescent sxts was used by hameury et al .",
    "( 1997 ) to explain the light curve of the transient source , gro j1655 - 45 , during its recent outburst .",
    "previously , mineshige & wheeler ( 1989 ) and huang & wheeler ( 1989 ) had suggested that outbursts in transients are due to a thermal instability in the thin accretion disk and extended a model developed previously for dwarf novae to black hole transients .",
    "however , if the thin disk extends down to the last stable orbit in quiescence , the predicted recurrence time between outbursts is inconsistent with observations ( lasota , narayan , & yi 1996 ; mineshige 1996 ) .",
    "the predicted and observed time scales are in better agreement if the thin disk is truncated at a large transition radius , @xmath10 .    in adaf models of quiescent sxts ,",
    "the mass accretion rate is fairly low , @xmath11 in eddington units ( narayan et al .",
    "1996 , 1997a ) .",
    "narayan ( 1996 ) proposed that at higher accretion rates the same model might naturally explain the more luminous spectral states of black hole binaries .",
    "this suggestion was worked out in detail by esin , mcclintock & narayan ( 1997 , hereafter emn ) .",
    "they showed that the low state is similar to the quiescent state in its flow configuration , but with a mass accretion rate roughly two orders of magnitude higher , namely @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is in eddington units .",
    "similar models were proposed for the low state of cyg x-1 by shapiro et al .",
    "( 1976 ) and ichimaru ( 1977 ) .",
    "in particular ,",
    "ichimaru ( 1977 ) was the first to recognize the importance of advection dominated accretion for understanding bhxbs ; sadly , his paper was forgotten for many years . at yet higher accretion rates ,",
    "an adaf can not be maintained at large radii ; the transition radius ( i.e. the inner edge of the thin disk ) then comes closer to the black hole .",
    "the spectra produced by such models resemble well the intermediate state spectra observed in some systems .",
    "finally , for yet higher mass accretion rates , the thin disk extends all the way down to the last stable orbit and the adaf is restricted to a corona above the disk .",
    "such a configuration describes the high state .",
    "emn demonstrated that their model , consisting of an inner adaf surrounded by an outer thin disk , can reproduce the low , intermediate and high state spectra of bhxbs .",
    "moreover , they showed that the existence of the critical accretion rate @xmath14 above which the adaf solution disappears provides a natural explanation for spectral transitions between the high and low state .",
    "emn modeled the outburst of nova muscae 1991 using this scenario and showed that the model successfully reproduces the observations of the system in the three spectral states .",
    "recent observations of several bhxbs have confirmed the basic conclusions of emn . by studying the fluorescent fe k@xmath15 line and compton reflection component in the low state spectrum of cyg x-1 , gierliski et al .",
    "( 1997a ) concluded that the cold reflecting medium does not extend down to the marginally stable orbit ( for a non - rotating black hole ) in the low state .",
    "the same conclusion was also reached by dove et al .",
    "( 1997a , 1997b ) , who found that the reprocessing of the hot radiation in the cold medium is too weak , and , therefore , that the cold disk must be truncated relatively far outside @xmath16 .",
    "a more direct confirmation came from zhang et al .",
    "( 1997a , 1997b ) and @xmath17ycki et al .",
    "( 1997 ) who studied the transition between the low and high spectral states in cyg x-1 and nova muscae respectively , and found a larger value for the transition radius in the low state than in the high state .",
    "this confirms the overall qualitative features of the emn model .",
    "we begin this paper in  2 with a review of the predictions of the emn model ; in particular , we discuss the spectral signatures predicted for various state transition , and show how they can be used as diagnostics when the available spectral information is incomplete . in ",
    "3 we concentrate on the recent hard  soft spectral state transition in cyg x-1 . we show that the data are consistent with the basic scenario described above , namely that during the transition cyg x-1 went from the low state , with a relatively large inner radius for the thin disk and an accretion rate near the critical value , to a series of intermediate states with smaller transition radii , and culminated in the high state with @xmath18 .",
    "we show that this model convincingly explains the overall spectral evolution of the system , as well as reproduces its hard and soft state spectra fairly well .",
    "in  4 we discuss the application of the model to another black hole system , gro j0422 + 32 , during its 1992 outburst .",
    "we demonstrate that the spectrum of gro j0422 + 32 near the peak of the outburst is well modeled by a low state spectrum with @xmath19 .",
    "we then argue that since the spectrum remained a hard power - law throughout the outburst , the accretion rate never increased significantly above its critical value .",
    "thus gro j0422 + 32 never went into an intermediate or high spectral state .",
    "we show that this conclusion is consistent with the observed anti - correlation between the cutoff energy and the x - ray luminosity during the decay after the outburst .",
    "finally , in  5 we show that the emn model also provides some clues to the secondary outbursts observed in gro j1719@xmath024 ( also known as grs  1716 - 249 or nova ophiuchi 1993 ) .",
    "though the spectral evolution of the system since its discovery in september 1993 is not well - documented in the literature , we show that the known facts are consistent with an outburst from the quiescent to the very high spectral state , like those seen in `` typical '' sxts ( e.g. nova muscae or a0620@xmath000 ) , followed by a series of low - high state transitions , similar to those observed in cyg x-1 .",
    "we conclude in  6 with a summary .",
    "we begin with a brief description of the model geometry and the calculations ( see emn for details ) .",
    "we consider a schwarzschild black hole of mass @xmath20 accreting matter from its binary companion at a rate @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the eddington accretion rate computed for @xmath23 radiative efficiency .",
    "the binary orbital angular momentum vector is inclined at an angle @xmath24 to the observer s line of sight .    the basic picture of mass accretion via an adaf in the context of bhxbs",
    "was worked out in a series of papers by narayan and collaborators ( narayan et al .",
    "1996 ; narayan 1996 ; narayan et al . 1997a ; hameury et al . 1997 ; emn ) . in this scenario ,",
    "the accretion flow is divided into two distinct zones .",
    "the inner part is modeled as a hot optically thin adaf extending down to the black hole horizon , while the outer part consists of an optically thick , geometrically thin disk with a hot corona ( modeled as an adaf ) above it .",
    "the transition radius between the two zones , @xmath25 ( hereafter all radii are in schwarzschild units ) , is one of the model parameters .",
    "another less important parameter is the radius of the outer edge of the accretion flow , @xmath26 .",
    "though the total mass accretion rate in the disk and corona is constant at each radius ( this is not strictly true in time - dependent flows , but we make this assumption for simplicity ) , it is not possible to determine from first principles the fraction of mass accreted through the corona .",
    "this is because the coupling between the hot corona and the cold disk through evaporation and thermal conduction ( see e.g. meyer & meyer - hofmeister 1994 ) , is poorly understood .",
    "we simply assume that the coronal mass accretion rate is inversely proportional to the radius , i.e. _",
    "c(r ) = ( ) ,  r > . (",
    "the results are not very different if we assume other radial profiles for @xmath27 . )",
    "once the total accretion rate @xmath13 and accretion rate in the corona @xmath28 are set , all the relevant properties of the hot flow can be computed .",
    "the adaf is treated as a collection of spherical shells , truncated near the pole to mimic the flattening of the density profile .",
    "each shell is characterized by its radial and azimuthal velocity , gas density , electron and proton temperatures , magnetic field strength , etc .",
    "these quantities are determined by solving the global dynamical conservation laws of mass , angular momentum , radial momentum and energy , together with the radiative transfer problem .",
    "the manner in which the solutions are obtained is described in detail in narayan , kato & honma 1997c , narayan et al .",
    "( 1997a ) and emn ; here we present a brief summary and introduce the model parameters .    in each shell",
    "the viscous energy dissipation is computed using the standard @xmath15-prescription .",
    "we assume that most of the energy is deposited in the protons ( see bisnovatyi - kogan & lovelace 1997 , quataert 1997 , gruzinov 1997 and blackman 1997 for recent discussions of this assumption ) ; the protons then reach nearly virial temperature through viscous heating and adiabatic compression .",
    "we further assume that the electrons and protons are coupled only through coulomb collisions , which is inefficient in a hot , low - density plasma .",
    "thus , only a fraction @xmath29 of the viscous energy is transferred to the electrons , and the rest is carried inside the black hole horizon as entropy of the gas .",
    "the quantity @xmath30 is called the advection parameter , and is solved for self - consistently .    the electrons in the flow cool via three processes : bremsstrahlung , synchrotron radiation , and inverse compton scattering . to compute the synchrotron emissivity of the gas ( mahadevan , narayan & yi 1996 ) , we assume that the tangled magnetic field is roughly in equipartition with the hot gas , so that the ratio of the gas to total pressure , @xmath31 , is of order 0.5 . in calculating the rate of cooling due to compton scattering we take into account the coupling between different shells of the adaf , as well as the interaction between the hot flow and the thin disk ( narayan et al .",
    "1997a , emn ) .",
    "the radial profiles of electron and proton temperature in the adaf are determined by demanding that the energy equations for both protons and electrons are satisfied in each radial shell .",
    "the rate of change of entropy of the protons is set equal to the viscous energy dissipation minus losses through coulomb collisions with electrons .",
    "for the electrons , the entropy change is set equal to the energy gain through coulomb coupling with the protons , plus the fraction @xmath32 of the viscous energy dissipation that goes directly into heating the electrons , minus radiative cooling . in our calculations",
    "we adopt @xmath33 , though the results are not sensitive to the exact value of this parameter as long as @xmath34 .",
    "the emission from the thin disk is calculated using the standard multicolor blackbody method ( e.g. frank et al .",
    "1992 ) corrected for graybody effects due to electron scattering ( e.g. shimura & takahara 1995 ) ; in addition , we include the compton reflection component due to the scattering of hot adaf photons incident on the disk surface , and fluorescent iron k@xmath15 line emission . in emn",
    "the thin disk was treated as an infinitely thin plane . here",
    "we take into account the finite disk thickness , which we assume to be equal to the local pressure scale height .",
    "the scale height itself is calculated self - consistently including the effect of irradiation of the disk by radiation from the adaf .",
    "the modified blackbody spectrum of the disk is computed using the standard expression : l_,disk(r ) dr = ( ) ^4 b_(f_mbb  t_eff(r ) ) 2 2",
    "r dr , where @xmath35 is the planck function , @xmath36 is the effective surface temperature of the disk at radius @xmath37 ( which includes both the local viscous dissipation as well as the fraction of the irradiating flux which is absorbed ) , and @xmath38 is a factor which allows for modified blackbody effects ; we set @xmath38 equal to 1.7 following shimura & takahara ( 1995 ) .",
    "not all photons incident on the thin disk are absorbed and reprocessed .",
    "a significant fraction of the incident energy is compton scattered in the upper disk layers and is effectively reflected back with lower energy than that of the incident photons .",
    "the result is a broad peak centered at around 30 kev .",
    "we compute this part of the spectrum by convolving the incident spectrum with the angle - averaged greens function for compton reflection of monoenergetic photons from a cold , neutral , optically thick medium ( white , lightman & zdziarski 1988 ; lightman & white 1988 ) . the metal abundances are taken from morrison & mccammon ( 1983 ) .    finally , we compute the strength and shape of the fluorescent iron line produced through photoelectric absorption of the incident x - ray photons with energies above the k - shell absorption edge , @xmath39 .",
    "we compute the line strength using the empirical formula given by george & fabian ( 1991 ) , and the line profile taking into account gravitational redshift and doppler shifts due to rotation ( fabian et al .",
    "however , we ignore the effects of ray bending in the vicinity of the black hole ; this effect becomes important only when the transition is below @xmath40 ( fabian et al .",
    "1989 ) .",
    "emn calculated the spectra of the above model as a function of the two main parameters , @xmath13 and @xmath41 , and identified different regions of parameter space with the known spectral states of black hole systems . here",
    "we summarize their scenario for the quiescent , low , intermediate and high spectral states .",
    "we ignore the very high state , which is not relevant for this paper ( this state was in any case , not explained very convincingly by emn ) .    at low mass accretion rates ( @xmath42 ) and relatively large transition radii ( @xmath43 ) the model spectra",
    "strongly resemble the quiescent states of transient black hole systems ( e.g. a0620 - 00 , v404 cyg , gro j1655 - 40 ; see narayan et al . 1996 ,",
    "narayan et al .",
    "1997a ; hameury et al .",
    "1997 ) . in this region of parameter space ,",
    "the optical / uv part of the spectrum is dominated by self - absorbed synchrotron emission from the adaf ( nbm ) and the x - rays are produced by bremsstrahlung emission and comptonized synchrotron photons .",
    "the contribution from the thin disk is negligible .",
    "the spectral slope in the x - ray band varies strongly with the accretion rate ( see figure 1a ) . for @xmath11 ,",
    "bremsstrahlung dominates and the spectral slope is roughly constant with photon index @xmath44 ( n.b . in emn",
    "the photon index was denoted by the symbol @xmath45 ) . in the range @xmath46 ,",
    "the x - ray spectrum is dominated by compton scattered synchrotron photons , and the photon index increases to @xmath47 , producing a steeper spectrum .",
    "the radiative efficiency of the adaf is proportional to @xmath13 ( narayan & yi 1995b ) , so that the quiescent state spectra have very low luminosities , @xmath48 , consistent with what is observed .    models with @xmath49 and @xmath50 are associated with the low state of bhxbs . in this regime ,",
    "the x - ray part of the spectrum is formed by comptonized synchrotron photons .",
    "therefore , with increasing @xmath13 as the optical depth and compton @xmath51-parameter increase the spectral slope flattens ( figure 1a ) .",
    "the emission is dominated by high energy photons at @xmath52 kev .",
    "the thin disk may contribute significantly to the observed emission in the optical / uv band , though the exact contribution depends on the value of @xmath41 ( compare figures 1a and 1b ) .",
    "however , the shape of the x - ray spectrum is not sensitive to the location of the transition radius , as long as @xmath53 .",
    "in fact , even with @xmath54 , the slope in the 1 - 10 kev range remains hard , and the only noticeable difference is in the appearance of an ultrasoft disk component below 1 kev , the presence of a reflection bump at @xmath55 kev and the strength of iron fluorescent line .",
    "it has been demonstrated in several papers that two - temperature adafs exist only for accretion rates below some critical value @xmath14 ( ichimaru 1977 , rees et al .",
    "1982 , narayan & yi 1995b , chen et al .",
    "1995 , emn ) . above @xmath14",
    "the accreting gas cools so rapidly , that the flow cools down to form the standard optically - thick shakura - sunyaev disk .",
    "emn demonstrated that @xmath14 is a function of the transition radius between the hot and cold flow , increasing slightly with decreasing @xmath41 .",
    "thus , they proposed that when the accretion rate in bhxbs increases above the critical value for a given value of @xmath41 , the outer parts of the hot flow start cooling down to form a thin disk , i.e. @xmath41 decreases in an attempt to keep @xmath13 at @xmath14 .",
    "when @xmath41 falls below about 30 , the model spectra resemble the intermediate state spectra observed in several black hole systems , e.g. nova muscae ( ebisawa et al .",
    "1994 ) , cyg x-1 ( belloni et al .",
    "1996 ) , gx 339@xmath04 ( mendez & van der klis 1997 ) .    since @xmath14 changes by at most @xmath56 while @xmath41 decreases by a large factor",
    "the bolometric luminosity is roughly the same for all intermediate state spectra .",
    "the spectral shape , however , is strongly dependent on the value of @xmath41 .",
    "for @xmath57 the x - ray spectra are similar to those in the low state ( large @xmath41 ) , with @xmath58 , while by the time @xmath59 , the spectrum is dominated by the soft blackbody component from the disk at @xmath2 kev , with a steep power - law tail characterized by @xmath60 .",
    "when the thin disk extends down to the last stable orbit , the adaf is restricted to the corona above the disk .",
    "emn associate this flow configuration with the high state , in which blackbody radiation from the disk dominates the spectrum and the corona produces only a weak high energy tail . because the electron temperature in the adaf is rather low in the high state configuration , the power - law tail in our model spectra turns over at @xmath52 kev , while the observed spectra extend to @xmath61 kev without a cut - off ( e.g. grove et al .",
    "this discrepancy either indicates the presence of non - thermal electrons , or more likely is due to bulk motion comptonization of the thin disk photons , as suggested by ebisawa , titarchuk & chakrabarti ( 1996 ) .",
    "the radial velocity of the adaf gas is on the order of the free fall velocity , and since the electron temperature in the high state decreases , the bulk motion comptonization ( which we do not take into account in our model ) might become more important than thermal comptonization .    in their model for the spectral evolution of nova muscae during its 1991 outburst",
    ", emn assumed that the plateau in the lightcurve of the system observed between days 130 and 200 , corresponds to the transition from the high to the low spectral state , with @xmath41 increasing from 3 to @xmath62 ( the upper value was determined from the quiescent state spectrum , see narayan et al .",
    "this assumption was made for the sake of simplicity , since the data used in the paper were not good enough to place better constraints on @xmath41 in the low state .",
    "recent detailed analysis by @xmath17ycki et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , seems to imply that by day 200 , @xmath41 increased only up to @xmath63 . to reconcile this result with the value of @xmath41 in quiescence",
    ", we must conclude that the thin disk continued to evaporate after day 200 , while the mass accretion rate dropped from its value in the low state , to that in quiescence .",
    "as pointed out above , as long as @xmath64 in the low state , the exact position of the transition radius does not significantly change the x - ray spectrum ( compare figures 1a and 1b ) .",
    "thus this slight modification of the model has no effect on the main results of emn .    in the discussion above we have outlined how the spectrum of the adaf plus the disk changes as a function of @xmath13 and @xmath41 .",
    "the other parameters , such as @xmath65 , @xmath26 , @xmath24 , @xmath15 and @xmath31 , do not significantly affect the main features of the model spectra .",
    "for example , changing the mass of the accreting black hole affects only the normalization of the spectrum and the effective temperature of the thin disk ( @xmath66 , frank et al .",
    "larger values of @xmath15 and @xmath31 produce slightly harder low state spectra , and raise the value of @xmath14 ( see narayan 1996 ; narayan et al .",
    "1997a and emn for detailed discussion ) , but the overall behavior of the model is unaffected .    in the calculations presented below , we generally set @xmath67 and @xmath68 , which we consider to be the most natural values for these parameters .",
    "the former simply restates our assumption of equipartition between magnetic and gas pressure , a common assumption in many areas of high - energy astrophysics . for the viscosity parameter @xmath15",
    "we follow the prescription suggested by hawley & balbus ( 1996 ) , @xmath69 with @xmath70 between 0.5 and 0.6 . for the other two parameters , @xmath65 and @xmath24",
    ", we adopt values suggested by observations of the systems we model .      though some black hole candidates are always observed in the same spectral state ( e.g. lmc x-3 and 1e 1740.7@xmath02942 ) , the majority of observed bhxbs exhibit some degree of long - term spectral variability .",
    "the most dramatic behavior is observed in soft x - ray transients ( also known as `` x - ray novae '' ) , which in some cases have been detected in all five spectral states , including the `` very high state '' not discussed in this paper .",
    "a typical example of such a system is nova muscae ( e.g. ebisawa et al .",
    "1994 , emn ) .",
    "most other black hole systems exhibit two or three spectral states .",
    "for example , cyg x-1 routinely switches between the low state and high state , passing through a series of intermediate states ( e.g. phlips et al .",
    "1996 ; zhang et al .",

    ", one can follow the spectral evolution all the way to the luminous high state .",
    "apart from the monotonic increase in the overall luminosity , the most striking changes are seen in the spectral slope in the x - ray band .",
    "the spectrum is hard in the quiescent state , becomes softer as the mass accretion rate increases ( the photon index reaches its maximum @xmath47 for @xmath73 ) , and switches again to a very hard spectrum in the low state . during the transition from the low to the high state",
    ", the spectrum softens again and continues to soften with increasing @xmath13 in the high state .",
    "note that the exact value of @xmath41 in the low and quiescent states changes only the characteristic frequency of the thin disk component ( generally located in the uv or optical part of the spectrum ) and not the shape of the x - ray emission .",
    "a less obvious , but nonetheless important change takes place in the position of the high energy thermal cut - off in the spectrum . in the quiescent state ,",
    "the cooling of the flow is very inefficient and the electron temperature in the inner regions of the adaf is relatively high , reaching @xmath74 k. however , with increasing @xmath13 the electron temperature drops due to increased cooling , and the exponential cut - off occurs at lower energies .",
    "the resulting relationship between the average electron temperature of the flow inside @xmath75 , and the x - ray luminosity at 100 kev ( the band which is most sensitive to changes in @xmath13 ) , is shown in figure  2 .",
    "clearly , during the transition from the quiescent to the low state , @xmath76 and the hard x - ray luminosity are _ anti - correlated_.    during the transition through the intermediate states , when @xmath41 decreases without significant change in @xmath13 , @xmath76 continues to fall .",
    "as the blackbody disk component becomes more prominent , the hot accretion flow is cooled progressively more efficiently by the soft photons from the thin disk . both the hard x - ray flux and the temperature decrease .",
    "therefore , in the intermediate spectral state , the flux at 100 kev and @xmath76 are _ correlated _ with each other , as clearly shown in figure 2 .    though the spectra corresponding to different states are very distinct when compared over a wide range of frequencies , say from optical to x - rays , in real life one generally has much more limited information , e.g. just the hard x - ray flux . when the data are restricted to a relatively narrow energy band",
    ", different spectral transitions may look rather similar .",
    "the relationship between @xmath76 and the hard x - ray flux illustrated in figure 2 could then be used as a diagnostic to determine the nature of the transition .",
    "cyg x-1 , discovered by bowyer et al .",
    "( 1965 ) , is one of the oldest known x - ray sources and perhaps the most thoroughly studied galactic black hole candidate .",
    "the system consists of a compact object orbiting around an o9.7  iab supergiant ( walborn 1973 ; gies & bolton 1986a ) with a period of 5.6 days .",
    "the x - ray emission is most likely powered by focused wind accretion from the optical companion ( gies & bolton 1986b ) .",
    "the extinction towards cyg x-1 places this system at a distance of @xmath77 kpc ( margon & bowyer 1973 ; bregman et al .",
    "1973 ) ; we use 2.5 kpc for comparisons between the model and observations .    from the orbital motion of the primary",
    ", the mass function of the compact object is measured to be @xmath78 ( gies & bolton 1982 ) , and recent estimates ( e.g. herrero et al . 1995 ) place the mass of the optical companion at @xmath79 .",
    "unfortunately , the orbital inclination of the system is not well known ; the values quoted in the literature vary between @xmath80 and @xmath81 ( e.g. dolan 1992 ; ninkov et al .",
    "1987 and references therein ) .",
    "this uncertainty implies that the mass of the black hole candidate can be anywhere in the range between @xmath82 and @xmath83 . for our calculation",
    "we adopt @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "cyg x-1 spends most of its time in the hard state , which is characterized by a hard power - law x - ray spectrum with a photon index @xmath84 .",
    "the power - law is modified by an exponential cutoff with e - folding energy @xmath85 kev ( e.g. phlips et al .",
    "1996 ; dove et al . 1997b ; gierliski et al . 1997a , and references therein ) , and perhaps some soft blackbody emission with characteristic temperature @xmath86 kev ( e.g. balucinska - church et al .",
    "1995 ; ebisawa et al .",
    "1996 ) . in some hard state spectra of cyg x-1",
    "there is also a strong indication of spectral hardening above 10 kev , usually interpreted as a compton - reflection component from a cold disk ( done et al .",
    "1992 ; gierliski et al .",
    "another evidence for the presence of the disk is the detection of an fe k - edge at @xmath87 kev as well as a narrow fe k@xmath15 fluorescence line ( e.g. barr , white & page 1985 ; ebisawa et al . 1996 ; gierliski et al .",
    "1997a ) .    historically , the combination of hard power - law continuum and reflection features has been interpreted in terms of a cold disk with a slab - like hot corona model ( e.g. haardt et al . 1993 and references therein",
    "; though see also shapiro et al .",
    "1976 and ichimaru 1977 ) , where the hard x - ray emission is produced by inverse compton scattering of the disk photons in the corona , and the irradiation of the thin disk by the hot photons from the corona generates the reflection component and the iron line .",
    "however , recent observations and theoretical work have shown that this geometry is not appropriate for explaining the hard state spectra of cyg x-1 .",
    "for example , the covering factor inferred by gierliski et al .",
    "( 1997a ) is too small to be consistent with the slab corona geometry .",
    "similarly , the observed fe k@xmath15 line is too narrow to allow the disk to extend close to the black hole ( ebisawa et al .",
    "more detailed theoretical modeling of the standard disk - corona configuration show that models in which the disk extends all the way to the last stable orbit do not allow a high enough electron temperature in the corona to reproduce the observed hard power - law slope and high energy cut - off ( dove et al .",
    "1997a , 1997b ; poutanen , krolik & ryde 1997 ) .",
    "the logical conclusion is that the thin disk is truncated at a radius equal to at least a few tens of @xmath88 , and that the inner region of the accretion flow is filled with hot gas .",
    "qualitatively , this conclusion is in perfect agreement with the prediction of the emn model for the low spectral state of accreting black hole systems ( see  [ transition ] ) .",
    "figure 3 shows that there is also a reasonable quantitative agreement between the model and the hard state spectra of cyg x-1 .",
    "the data shown on the figure correspond to nearly simultaneous ginga and osse observations made on july 6 1991 ( gierliski et al .",
    "for the spectral fitting we used a grid of adaf model spectra , characterized by three parameters : @xmath41 , the hi column density along the line of sight to cyg x-1 , @xmath89 ( since the data does not extend below 3 kev , we did not obtain any meaningful constraint on @xmath89 ) , and the overall normalization . in each model we fixed @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and set the mass accretion rate to its critical value .",
    "the best fitting model spectrum corresponds to @xmath90 and is shown in figure 3 as a solid line .",
    "clearly , this model does a reasonable job of reproducing both the spectral slope and the shape of the exponential cut - off .",
    "the value of the transition radius derived from this fit is consistent with the observed narrow width of the iron fluorescence line ( e.g. ebisawa et al . 1996 ) . to illustrate how sensitive the spectrum is to the value of @xmath41",
    ", we show the spectrum corresponding to @xmath91 , keeping the other parameters the same ( dashed line ) .",
    "this curve produces a slightly worse fit in the high energy end of the spectrum , but the difference between the two model spectra above 2 kev is no greater than @xmath23 , comparable to the uncertainty introduced by the approximations made in our current calculations .",
    "for example , using the relativistic global flow solutions in the kerr geometry ( e.g. gammie & popham 1997 ) instead of those based on newtonian physics , will produce higher electron temperatures in the adaf ( as demonstrated by narayan et al .",
    "1997d ) , and therefore may well change the shape of the high energy cut - off .",
    "we would therefore say that cyg x-1 in the low state must have a transition radius @xmath92 .",
    "the exact value of the black hole mass does not affect the overall shape of the x - ray spectrum above @xmath93 kev , but the inclination of the system does have a significant effect both on the shape and normalization of the spectrum ( e.g. see emn ) .",
    "since the density profile in an adaf is slightly flattened ( narayan & yi 1995a ) , for lower values of @xmath24 the observer sees deeper into the flow , i.e. the observed photons are produced in a hotter medium .",
    "moreover , because of lower optical depth near the pole , the scattered photons escape preferentially in that direction . as a result , systems observed at lower inclination are significantly brighter , and have higher exponential cut - off energies .",
    "we find that our fit above 100 kev becomes significantly worse for @xmath94 , which forces us to adopt @xmath95 , to be consistent with the other known binary parameters .",
    "with @xmath71 and @xmath96 the model spectrum shown on figure 3 is @xmath97 times more luminous than the data .",
    "this normalization error is most likely the result of the simplified way we have modeled the flattening of the accretion flow ( see  [ dynamics ] and narayan et al .",
    "1997a , emn ) .",
    "because we have truncated our model near the poles , the effect of changing the inclination in the vicinity of @xmath98 is very dramatic , but perhaps not very realistic . in view of this limitation in the model ,",
    "as well as possible uncertainty in the distance to cyg x-1 , we feel that the error in the normalization does not represent a serious problem .",
    "our simplified treatment of the adaf density profile is also one of the causes for the slight discrepancy between our model spectra and the data in the region around @xmath99 kev .",
    "figure 3 shows that the iron k@xmath15 line equivalent width and the depth of the corresponding fe edge predicted by the model fall short of what is observed , implying that the covering factor of the cold disk is too small . by allowing the photons scattered in the adaf to escape preferentially in the direction away from the thin disk ,",
    "the truncation of the hot flow near the poles is at least partially responsible for this discrepancy .",
    "another effect we have not included is partial ionization of the gas in the thin disk .",
    "since highly ionized iron ions have significantly larger fluorescent yields than neutral atoms , taking into account the ionization state of the thin disk may significantly increase the predicted strength of the fe line ( e.g. @xmath17ycki & czerny 1994 ) .",
    "occasionally , cyg x-1 undergoes a transition from the hard to the soft spectral state , and the spectrum switches to one which is dominated by an ultrasoft component with a temperature @xmath100 kev ( cui et al .",
    "1997a ; dotani et al .",

    "cui et al .",
    "discovered that the observed time lag between the soft and hard energy bands is roughly @xmath102 times smaller in the soft state than in the hard state .",
    "if this time lag is due to compton scattering of soft disk photons in the hot `` corona '' , its magnitude must be strongly correlated with the optical depth of the hot region .",

    "moreover , the presence of the intermediate state , during which @xmath41 changed from its large low state to its small high state value , was clearly inferred both from the spectral and temporal evolution of the system ( cui et al .",

    "because of this , we feel that our distance estimate is quite robust .",

    "the rapid rise and decline of the x - ray luminosity occurred through a dramatic change in the mass accretion rate , caused perhaps by an instability in the outer thin disk ( e.g. cannizzo 1993 ; hameury et al .",
    "however , since the spectrum of the system remained hard , and none of the published spectra show any indication of the compton reflection component or iron fluorescence ( e.g. see figure 6 ) , we conclude that the transition radius between the hot and cold emission regions was at all times greater than @xmath132 , and that the mass accretion rate remained at or below its critical value , @xmath9 .",
    "thus , this outburst of gro j0422 + 32 is significantly different from that of nova muscae 1991 , in which the accretion rate apparently reached the eddington limit and the system went from the quiescent to the very high spectral state ( emn ) . in gro j0422 + 32 ,",

    "moreover , the numerical values for the gas temperature plotted in figure 2 do not exactly correspond to the e - folding energy of the observed spectrum ( though we expect the two to be proportional to each other ) , since @xmath146 is in a sense a measure of the _ average _ electron temperature in the adaf .",
    "the transient system gro j1719@xmath024 was discovered in outburst on 1993 september 25 by batse and sigma ( harmon et al .",
    "1993 ; ballet et al . 1993 ) .",
    "the hard x - ray flux ( 20 - 100 kev ) reached its maximum of @xmath149 crab ( e.g. van der hooft 1996 ) five days after the original detection , and for the next @xmath150 days the flux level remained high , declining by no more than @xmath151 .",
    "this was followed by an abrupt drop , during which the source flux dipped below the batse 1 day detection limit of 0.1 crab . for the next @xmath152 days the flux level remained undetectable by batse . however , between september 1994 and september 1995 , the light curve of the source exhibited five separate flare events , with maximum amplitude roughly @xmath153 of the original outburst ( e.g. hjellming et al .",
    "these secondary flares were characterized by slow , almost linear rises and abrupt decays , opposite to what is typically observed in x - ray novae ( e.g. see a review by tanaka & shibazaki 1996 ) .",
    "the optical counterpart for gro j1719@xmath024 was found by della valle , mirabele & cordier ( 1993 ) . from the interstellar absorption ,",
    "della valle , mirabele & rodriuez ( 1994 ) estimated the distance to be @xmath154 kpc , which together with the upper limit on the brightness of the system in quiescence , allowed them to conclude that the companion is a main - sequence star of spectral type later than k. interpreting the prominent optical period of @xmath155 as a superhump phenomenon , masetti et al .",
    "( 1996 ) estimated that the mass of the compact object must be @xmath156 .",
    "thus , gro j1719@xmath024 appears to be a low - mass black hole system .    on september 25 - 26 1993",
    "the source spectrum was hard , similar to the low state of cyg x-1 , with a power - law photon index @xmath157 in the hard x - ray ( 20 - 100 kev ) band , and @xmath158 in the softer ( 2 - 27 kev ) band ( harmon et al . 1993 ; kaniovsky , borozdin , & sunyaev 1993 ) .",
    "van der hooft et al .",
    "( 1996 ) report that the 20 - 100 kev spectrum softened to @xmath159 during the rise to the first maximum and continued to soften gradually thereafter .",
    "the spectral behavior of gro j1719@xmath024 during the secondary flares ( as we will denote the five smaller events to distinguish them from the original outburst ) in 1994 - 95 is rather uncertain .",
    "osse observations at the trailing edge of the first flare ( 1994 november @xmath160 ) showed a power - law spectrum with no high energy cut - off and photon index @xmath161 ( grove et al .",
    "the same team observed a hard exponentially truncated power - law spectrum with @xmath109 near the peak of the second flare ( 1995 february 1 - 14 ) .",
    "just two days later , the source was detected by the mir / kvant team , who reported a power - law spectrum ( in the energy band 2 - 27 kev ) with a photon index @xmath162 .",
    "to summarize , it appears that gro j1719@xmath024 was observed in three distinct spectral states , two of which are similar to the soft and hard states of cyg x-1 .",
    "when the source was bright in the hard x - ray band during the flares , its spectrum was best characterized as a hard power - law with an exponential cut - off at @xmath163 kev ( low state ) , while the periods of lower hard x - ray flux during the flares seemed to be associated with the appearance of a steeper power - law component with @xmath164 and no cut - off below @xmath61 kev ( high state ) .",
    "the third spectral state appeared during the first and largest outburst , and is characterized by high hard x - ray flux and a rather soft spectrum with @xmath165 , reminiscent of the very high state seen in nova muscae and gx 339@xmath04 ( e.g. ebisawa et al .",
    "1994 ; miyamoto et al .",
    "1991 ) .",
    "how can this behavior be interpreted in terms of the emn spectral state model ? since the rise to peak intensity during the first outburst was very similar to the outbursts exhibited by other black hole transients ( e.g. nova muscae , a0620 - 00 ) , we speculate that during this time the system made a rapid transition from the quiescent to the very high spectral state , following a dramatic increase in the mass accretion rate .",
    "the 20100 kev flux from gro j1719@xmath024 peaked at roughly @xmath166 ( van der hooft et al .",
    "1996 ) , which corresponds to @xmath167 ( for a source with a photon index @xmath159 at a distance of 2.4 kpc ) , comparable to the luminosity of nova muscae in the very high state ( ebisawa et al .",
    "1994 ; emn ) .",
    "the rapid drop in the hard x - ray flux @xmath168 days after the peak luminosity , is also very similar to that seen in the lightcurve of nova muscae ( emn ) , and we interpret it as the transition from the very high to the high state .",
    "after that , the hard x - ray flux remained below the batse threshold until the accretion rate dropped low enough for an adaf to form , i.e. the system entered an intermediate state and moved into the low state .",
    "the most straight - forward interpretation of the data during the secondary flares directly follows from grove et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . at the time of flare maxima ,",
    "the system was in the low ( or perhaps intermediate ) spectral state , characterized by a hard power - law spectrum with a thermal cut - off .",
    "unfortunately , the data are not good enough to place constraints on the presence of the compton reflection component , so that the position of the transition radius is uncertain , though it is likely that @xmath64 .",
    "we propose that the rapid decay which accompanied each secondary flare was caused by an increase in @xmath13 which precipitated a corresponding decrease in @xmath41 , or a disk instability of some sort which caused @xmath41 to decrease suddenly .",
    "thus , during the times when the flux in the batse band was low , we propose that the system was in the high spectral state , with @xmath41 close to the last stable orbit .    in figure 8",
    "we plot the e - folding energy obtained from the osse data taken on 1995 february 1 - 14 near the peak of the second flare , against the integrated osse flux . during this time , the x - ray luminosity was decreasing nearly monotonically with time .",
    "as in figure  6 , the values of @xmath146 were derived using an exponentially truncated power - law model with a fixed photon index , @xmath169 .",
    "we see that the hard x - ray luminosity and the e - folding energy are correlated .",
    "a comparison with figure 2 shows that this behavior is expected if the system is in the intermediate state and is switching from the low to the high state .",
    "thus , the data in figure 8 confirms the proposal we have made for the secondary flares .",
    "a detailed comparison of figures 7 and 8 shows that the values of @xmath146 in gro j1719@xmath024 are somewhat higher compared to gro j0422 + 32 .",
    "according to the model , the minimum @xmath146 in figure 7 must be roughly equal to the maximum @xmath146 in figure 8 ( see figure 2 ) . instead the latter appears to exceed the former by @xmath55 kev , though the errorbars are large .",
    "if this result is real it might imply that gro j1719@xmath024 has smaller inclination , or perhaps larger black hole spin .",
    "since during the high spectral state most of the system luminosity comes out as ultrasoft blackbody disk emission , observations in the energy range below 10 kev would provide the most direct test of our interpretation of the data on gro j1719@xmath024 .",
    "unfortunately , we are not aware of any such observations made during the times when the source was `` off '' in the batse energy band . according to our interpretation",
    ", the system should have been in the high state and , therefore , very bright around 1 kev .    in conclusion , we emphasize that the behavior of gro j1719@xmath024 is qualitatively quite similar to that of nova muscae 1991 . both sources showed a rapid increase in the 20 - 100 kev flux , followed by an abrupt drop , and followed later by a secondary maximum",
    ". however , there are two important differences between the lightcurves of the two systems .",
    "firstly , the complete outburst in gro j1719@xmath024 lasted at least twice as long as that in nova muscae , indicating that the time scale for the decrease of the mass accretion rate was different in the two systems .",
    "secondly , gro j1719@xmath024 showed five secondary flares , instead of just one observed in nova muscae .",
    "according to our interpretation , these flares were caused by oscillations of the transition radius , either as a result of fluctuations in the mass accretion rate or because of a disk instability .",
    "nova muscae , perhaps because of the mare rapid decline of @xmath13 , did not undergo such oscillations .",
    "the adaf solution ( ichimaru 1977 ; rees et al . 1982 ; narayan & yi 1994 , 1995b ; abramowicz et al . 1995 ; chen et al .",
    "1995 ) is currently the only known stable accretion model that explains the observed x - ray spectra of bhxbs with a self - consistent treatment of gas dynamics and radiative transfer .",
    "the model satisfies mass and momentum conservation at each radius , solves for the electron and ion temperatures through the use of appropriate energy equations , and includes a fairly sophisticated treatment of radiative processes .",
    "narayan ( 1996 ) and emn used the adaf solution to develop a unified picture of the quiescent , low , intermediate and high spectral states observed in bhxbs . in their model , the accretion flow consists of two distinct parts , a hot adaf inside some transition radius @xmath41 ( in schwarzschild units ) , and a standard thin disk with a hot corona outside @xmath41 .",
    "the different spectral states then correspond to different values of the two main parameters , @xmath13 and @xmath41 .",
    "the basic scenario that emerged from the work of narayan ( 1996 ) and emn is summarized in  2 . in the quiescent and low spectral states",
    "the transition radius is relatively large , @xmath53 , and variations in the observed spectrum result solely from changes in the mass accretion rate , @xmath13 . in the quiescent state",
    ", we have @xmath170 , while in the low state @xmath13 can be as high as about 0.1 ( in eddington units ) . the low state survives only until @xmath13 reaches a critical value @xmath9 .",
    "when @xmath171 , the outer parts of the adaf can no longer be in thermal equilibrium and the cool disk begins to encroach into the adaf . when the transition radius lies between @xmath90 and 3 ( with @xmath111 ) we have the so - called intermediate state . finally , above a certain @xmath13 , @xmath41 comes down to the marginally stable orbit , @xmath172 , and the adaf is restricted to a corona above the disk .",
    "this is the high state .",
    "some of the basic features of the emn model are similar to other models that have appeared previously in the literature .",
    "shapiro et al . ( 1976 ) and ichimaru ( 1977 ) suggested that the low state of cyg x-1 correspond to an optically thin , hot accretion flow , rather than the standard thin disk .",
    "ichimaru further speculated that the transition between the hard and soft states in cyg x-1 might be caused by a change in the outer boundary conditions of the accretion flow , which determines whether the accreting gas assumes the standard thin disk configuration or forms a hot optically thin flow .",
    "however , the model proposed by emn is the first successful attempt to unify the quiescent , low , intermediate and high spectral states within the framework of a single self - consistent calculation ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "application of the model outlined above to the outburst of nova muscae 1991 ( emn ) demonstrated that it reproduces well the individual low , intermediate and high state spectra of this system .",
    "moreover , the theoretical light curve based on a simple mapping between the mass accretion rate , transition radius and time is in good agreement with the observed x - ray and @xmath8-ray light curves .",
    "further confirmation of the main results of emn came from more detailed analysis of the spectra of nova muscae observed while the system was in the intermediate state ( @xmath17ycki et al .",
    "1997 ) . from detailed fitting of the fe k@xmath15 emission , @xmath17ycki et al .",
    "concluded that the inner edge of the thin disk did increase during this period , as predicted by emn .",
    "@xmath17ycki et al . also showed that there is a discrepancy in the exact value of @xmath41 during the intermediate state , but this is not a serious problem , as we have argued in  2.2 .",
    "the present paper describes further tests of the emn model on other black hole systems . in ",
    "3 we analyze data taken during the 1996 hard  soft state transition of cyg x-1 and compare with the predictions of the model .",
    "the results are encouraging .",
    "the hard and soft spectra of cyg x-1 are reasonably well fitted by low state and intermediate state model spectra ( figures 3 and 4 ) .",
    "the best fit value of the transition radius for the hard state is @xmath90 , consistent with the narrow width of the iron fluorescence line observed by ebisawa et al .",
    "( 1996 ) in the low state .",
    "the spectrum corresponding to @xmath173 is somewhat too soft to reproduce the data , though we feel that the uncertainties in our model ( e.g. use of newtonian dynamics and radiative transfer , as well as a simplistic treatment of the flattening of the adaf density profile ) are comparable to the difference between those two curves .",
    "we would thus say that the low state in cyg x-1 is consistent with any @xmath174 .",
    "the soft state spectrum is best described by a model with @xmath175 , i.e. close to the marginally stable orbit .",
    "we have also compared a sequence of intermediate and high state spectra computed for several values of @xmath41 between 100 ( its value in the low state ) and 3 ( the marginally stable orbit for a non - rotating black hole ) , to observations made by batse and rxte / asm during the 1996 transition in cyg x-1 . from figure 5 , it is clear that in addition to explaining the broad qualitative features of the transition , the model reproduces very well several details seen in the observations .",
    "the range of photon indices obtained with the model , @xmath176 , is very similar to that seen in the data .",
    "the model and the data both show anti - correlation between the soft and hard x - ray flux .",
    "the model also reproduces the pivoting around 10 kev seen in the data as well as the nearly constant bolometric luminosity throughout the transition .",
    "the striking similarity between the model and observations indicates that the general picture ( narayan 1996 , emn ) in which the low ",
    "high state transition arises from a change in the transition radius ( perhaps as a result of a minor fluctuation in the mass accretion rate ) must be close to the truth .    in  2.3 we review the main spectral signatures of the state transitions predicted by the emn model , and discuss how they can be used to deduce the physical changes in the accretion flow that accompany such transitions .",
    "we show that in both the low state and in the intermediate state a decrease in hard x - ray luminosity must invariably be accompanied by a softening of the overall spectrum .",
    "thus , from the point of view of an observer , if all one has is hard x - ray data , it is difficult to distinguish between a decrease of @xmath13 in the low state and a decrease in @xmath41 in the intermediate state .",
    "we show , however , that the position of the high energy cut - off is a much better diagnostic . in the low state ,",
    "the e - folding energy and the hard x - ray luminosity are anti - correlated , since at lower mass accretion rates the adaf is hotter .",
    "the exact opposite happens in the intermediate state , where a decrease in @xmath41 causes both the hard x - ray flux and the temperature of the hot flow to drop .",
    "the two effects are illustrated in figure 2 .",
    "to show how these properties of the model could be exploited in interpreting observations of real systems , in   4 and 5 we discuss the transient systems gro j0422 + 32 and gro j1719@xmath024 .",
    "we find that the observed spectral evolution of gro j0422 + 32 after the peak of its 1992 outburst must have corresponded to a transition between the low and quiescent spectral states .",
    "this interpretation arises from the fact that the cut - off temperature was anti - correlated with the x - ray luminosity during the first 30 days of the decline when osse observed the source ( figure 7 ) .",
    "moreover , we find that the spectrum observed at roughly half maximum luminosity is very well fitted by a low state model spectrum computed with @xmath71 , and @xmath177 .",
    "thus , gro j0422 + 32 seems to have been very different from a more `` typical '' transient like nova muscae or a0620@xmath000 . in gro j0422 + 32",
    "it would appear that the mass accretion rate even at the peak of the outburst was at or below the critical rate @xmath14 , i.e. @xmath178 .",
    "thus , gro j0422 + 32 was dominated by an adaf all through its outburst .",
    "interestingly , the accretion rate in this system in quiescence is estimated at @xmath179 ( menou 1997 , private communication ) , significantly lower than quiescent values in other transient systems ( narayan et al .",
    "1996 , 1997a ) .",
    "on the other hand , the outburst of gro j1719@xmath024 appears to have been closer to that of nova muscae .",
    "we make a tentative proposal that the first and largest peak corresponds to a transition from the quiescent to the very high state , characterized by high x - ray luminosity and a power - law spectrum with photon index @xmath180 ( hooft et al .",
    "the sharp drop in the batse flux two month after the initial outburst is very similar to that observed in nova muscae , which emn identified as the transition from the very high to the high state . according to our proposal ,",
    "the secondary flares correspond to a series of transitions between the high and intermediate spectral states .",
    "both the shapes of the spectra and the observed correlation between the e - folding energy and x - ray flux support this interpretation .",
    "of course , the fact that gro j1719@xmath024 oscillated five times between the high and intermediate state differentiates this source from nova muscae and a0620@xmath000 which had only one such transition .",
    "perhaps the decline of @xmath13 was not monotonic in gro j1719@xmath024 , or more likely the outer thin disk underwent some kind of a disk instability .",
    "although we have been quite successful in applying the emn model to cyg x-1 , gro j0422 + 32 and gro j1719@xmath024 , we would like to emphasize that the main results presented in this paper are still somewhat qualitative , and the uncertainties in the model are still too large to draw meaningful quantitative conclusions .",
    "the accretion flow calculations employed here take into account most of the relevant physical processes in a self - consistent way , and are superior to other analyses in the literature .",
    "nevertheless , a number of improvements need to be made before we can attempt detailed comparisons between our models and the observational data .",
    "the main avenue of future work lies in incorporating relativistic effects into the calculations .",
    "relativistic global flow solutions in kerr geometry ( abramowicz et al . 1996 ; peitz & appl 1997 ; gammie & popham 1997 ) and gravitational redshift have already been used in modeling the spectrum of sgr  a@xmath181 ( narayan et al .",
    "1997d ) . in calculating radiative transfer in an adaf , we need to include the effects of ray bending and doppler boosts due to the motion of the gas ( jaroszynski & kurpiewski 1997 ) , and to modify our treatment of compton scattering to take into account the bulk radial motion of the gas ( titarchuk et al .",
    "1996 , 1997 ) .",
    "our treatment of the thin disk spectrum must also be modified to include relativistic effects .",
    "the strength and shape of the iron fluorescence line and the corresponding absorption edge have recently been used as a successful diagnostic to probe the geometry and physical characteristics of the accretion flow ( e.g. @xmath17ycki et al .",
    "1997 ; cui et al .",
    "however , in order to use these features to constrain our model we must assume a more realistic density profile of the adaf in the vertical direction , instead of truncating the flow near the poles .",
    "we also need to compute self - consistently the ionization state of the thin disk .",
