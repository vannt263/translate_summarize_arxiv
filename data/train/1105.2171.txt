    "determine whether a graph @xmath0 is a pcg seems in general difficult even if at the beginning , when the problem arose in a computational biology context @xcite , it was conjectured that every graph was a pcg .",
    "nowadays it is known that this conjecture is false @xcite , while it is proved that some specific classes of graphs e.g. , graphs with five nodes or less @xcite , cliques and disjoint union of cliques @xcite , chordless cycles and single chord cycles @xcite and some particular subclasses of bipartite graphs @xcite , are pcg .",

    "if we relax these conditions , requiring only that the distance between some pair of leaves is smaller than or equal to @xmath17 ( i.e. we set @xmath10 ) then we are considering a particular subclass of pcg graphs , namely the _ leaf power _ graphs ( lpg ) .",
