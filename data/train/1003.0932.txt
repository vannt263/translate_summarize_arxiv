    "advanced nanostructuring techniques permit the creation of specific superconducting structures for controlling vortex motion in type - ii superconductors . experiments and simulations for square and triangular artificial pinning arrays",
    "demonstrate that pronounced commensurability effects occur when the number of vortices is an integer multiple of the number of pinning sites , and that these effects can be observed as peaks in the critical current.@xcite above the first matching field , multiple vortices may occupy individual pinning sites,@xcite or only a portion of the vortices may be captured by the pinning sites with the remaining vortices located in interstitial sites where they can still be pinned by the repulsive interactions with vortices at the pinning sites.@xcite vortex matter in these periodic pinning arrays can also exhibit a remarkably rich variety of distinct dynamical phases originally predicted in simulations.@xcite these include one - dimensional flow of interstitial vortices between immobile vortices in the pinning sites , disordered or turbulent phases where the number of moving vortices fluctuates strongly , and laminar states where the vortex flow can organize along the rows of pinning sites . the transitions between these different states appear as specific features in the voltage - current curves , including negative differential conductivity where the number of moving vortices or the average vortex velocity decreases with increasing drive . in very recent experiments , these dynamical phases were observed in both low temperature @xcite and high temperature @xcite superconductors with periodic pinning arrays .",
    "it is also possible to create periodic pinning arrays that contain intrinsic asymmetry , such as with asymmetric thickness modulation,@xcite funnel geometries,@xcite composite pinning sites,@xcite or arrays of triangular traps.@xcite this asymmetry can produce a diode effect when the depinning force is higher in one direction , and can give a ratchet effect in which a net dc vortex flow occurs upon application of an ac drive.@xcite reversals of the ratchet flow from the easy asymmetry direction to the hard asymmetry direction can occur as a function of magnetic field and other parameters @xcite due to various collective interactions of the vortices .",
    "one of the earliest proposals for a vortex ratchet involved a periodic asymmetric channel or funnel,@xcite and such geometries have now been experimentally fabricated.@xcite the first experiments on this system verified the existence of ratchet effects , but also detected boundary effects caused by the disordered injection of vortices at the edge of the sample.@xcite the edge effect can be overcome by using sample geometries where the vortices flow in annular asymmetric channels so that vortices need not enter or exit the sample.@xcite such a technique may also provide the resolution required to investigate individual vortex motion through the channels.@xcite    in this work we study the dynamics of vortices in a periodic asymmetric channel geometry or funnel array and show that a variety of new types of vortex dynamics and behaviors can arise , including a jamming effect and flow patterns that are organized such that only one vortex at a time passes through the funnel tip .",
    "such a geometry could be realized by etching the edge of a single superconducting strip into a periodic funnel shape so that the vortices would flow in a true single channel .",
    "funnel geometries created with periodic channels in two - dimensional superconducting samples should also exhibit many of the same properties we observe ; however , in these systems vortices located between the asymmetric channels could be important and under high drives could depin .",
    "the presence of vortices in the regions between the channels can be deduced from the onset of hysteresis in the critical current curves @xmath1 at fields higher than the fields at which many of the ratchet effects are observed.@xcite although our study focuses on interacting vortices in type - ii superconductors , we expect that the same dynamics will occur for other systems of repulsively interacting particles in funnel geometries .",
    "these include charged colloidal assemblies,@xcite magnetic colloids,@xcite charged metallic dots,@xcite and classical electron crystals.@xcite additionally , in recent experiments of ion flow through a single funnel , effects such as negative differential conductivity were observed.@xcite our results suggest that the same type of clogging effect we observe could be occurring in these artificial ion channels .",
    "an important feature that differentiates funnel geometries from the other vortex ratchet geometries is that in the funnel the vortices are forced to move through a narrow bottleneck . at this constricted point ,",
    "the repulsive vortex - vortex interactions are very important and favor the organization of the vortex flow into a pattern that permits only a single vortex to pass through the bottleneck at a time .",
    "the bottleneck has many features in common with granular hopper geometries where grains flow through a funnel . in the granular case",
    ", it is known that decreasing the width of the hopper aperture can cause the flow of grains to be impeded or jammed .",
    "@xcite systems that become immobile due to particle - particle interactions are often referred to as jammed .",
    "the physics of jamming has attracted growing interest as a way to understand many types of loose particle assemblies such as grains , colloids , and emulsions in situations where these systems exhibit a sudden onset of resistance to shear , with possible connections to the glass transition.@xcite in a granular hopper where grains flow through a thin funnel , the jamming effect occurs when some grains block the motion of other grains .",
    "the interaction between the grains is short ranged and has a sharp cutoff .",
    "vortices also experience a repulsive interaction ; however , it is significantly longer in range and smoother than the interaction among grains .",
    "understanding how systems with intermediate range or longer range interactions can develop a jammed state is an open question .",
    "generally , in a vortex system , increasing the effective vortex - vortex interaction strength reduces the effectiveness of the pinning and causes the depinning force to decrease .",
    "if vortex matter can exhibit a jamming effect , the opposite behavior would occur and the system would become more immobile with increasing vortex - vortex interaction strength .",
    "we note that in the peak effect phenomenon , the effective pinning force increases with increasing vortex density or temperature . many explanations of this effect involve the reduction of the effective vortex - vortex interaction force with increasing density or temperature due to changes in the penetration depth or softening of the vortex lattice near @xmath2 or @xmath3 @xcite in order to match the normal expectation of increased pinning force caused by decreased vortex interaction strength .",
    "superficially , however , the increased pinning force generated by increased vortex density resembles a jamming effect . in simulations of vortex systems with more vortices than pinning sites,@xcite gradually increasing the strength of the vortex - vortex interactions initially increased the depinning force since the vortices at the pinning sites blocked the free vortices from moving , similar to a jamming effect . on the other hand ,",
    "when there are more pinning sites than vortices , the depinning force monotonically decreases as the vortex - vortex interaction strength increases.@xcite this shows that if vortices are to exhibit jamming behavior , it must arise from the collective interactions of the vortices rather than from vortex - pin interactions alone . in our system",
    "we fix the bare vortex - vortex interaction strength and study the appearance of jamming and clogging effects due to density - induced changes in the effective importance of the vortex - vortex interactions .",
    "following previous techniques for simulating vortices in periodic pinning geometries , we employ langevin dynamics in a two - dimensional system.@xcite we consider a sample containing a single channel composed of @xmath4 funnels .",
    "each funnel has a small aperture size of @xmath5 , a wide aperture size of @xmath6 , and a length of @xmath7 , where lengths are measured in units of the london penetration depth @xmath8 .",
    "the funnels are aligned in the @xmath9 direction and the sample has periodic boundary conditions along the @xmath9 direction only .",
    "a total of @xmath10 vortices are placed only inside the funnel channel and the region outside the channel is empty .",
    "the motion of the vortices is calculated by integrating the following overdamped equation of motion : @xmath11 here the damping constant is @xmath12 in a crystal of thickness @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the elementary flux quantum , @xmath15 is the superconducting coherence length , and @xmath16 is the normal state resistivity . the vortex - vortex force is repulsive with a potential @xmath17 , where @xmath18 , @xmath19 is a modified bessel function , @xmath20 is the position of vortex @xmath21 , and @xmath22 .",
    "if a vortex approaches one of the channel walls sufficiently closely , it experiences a wall force @xmath23 .",
    "the channel walls are constructed out of @xmath24 repulsive elongated potential barriers which are inverted versions of the potential wells employed in ref .",
    "each barrier has a central rectangular region which repels vortices in the direction transverse to the long direction of the rectangle , along with two half - parabolic cap regions which repel vortices from the ends of the barrier .",

    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the barrier lengths are @xmath34 for the vertical walls and @xmath35 for the slanted funnel walls .",
    "the central portion of the channel is featureless and the vortices experience confining forces only from the barrier walls and not from the channel itself .",
    "the barriers are sufficiently strong that vortices can never cross them under the conditions considered in this work .",
    "the initial vortex positions are obtained by placing the vortices evenly throughout the funnel and performing simulated annealing .",
    "temperature is modeled as langevin kicks @xmath36 with the following properties : @xmath37 and @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "after the vortex positions are initialized , we apply an external drive @xmath40 representing the lorentz force from an applied current in the positive @xmath9 or easy - flow direction and measure the average vortex velocity @xmath41 .",
    "the drive is slowly increased in small increments with a fixed waiting time between each increment .",
    "the waiting time is taken sufficiently long that the system always reaches a steady state velocity at each drive before we make our measurements . the depinning force @xmath42 is defined as the drive at which @xmath43 . in this work",
    "we examine only the dynamics in the easy flow direction and note that in general @xmath44 is higher for driving in the hard or negative @xmath9 direction so that a diode effect is possible , in agreement with experiments.@xcite for driving in the hard direction , clogging type dynamics occur which will be explored elsewhere.@xcite    in our system the penetration depth @xmath8 is less than the funnel size , so many of our results should carry over to typical colloidal systems with optical trap arrays . in the vortex ratchet experiments of ref .",
    "@xcite , the size of the triangular traps is less than @xmath8 so we are working in a different regime from the experiment , although we expect that many of the same effects can appear in both systems .",

    "the varying sizes and shapes of the commensuration peaks are consistent with the existence of distinct arrangements of singly quantized vortices within the funnel plaquettes at different matching fields .",

    "the magnitude and shape of the commensuration peaks show striking variations when different types of vortex crystals form at different matching fields .",
    "for example , in square pinning arrays , a square vortex lattice forms at @xmath55 , a less stable dimer lattice with a smaller critical current peak appears at @xmath54 , a very stable triangular lattice with a strong critical current peak is present at @xmath53 , and the partially disordered vortex structures at @xmath61 and @xmath62 produce no peaks in the critical current.@xcite    for the asymmetric funnel array , the quasi - one - dimensional nature of the system might be expected to produce identical commensuration effects at each matching field ; however , it is possible for the vortices within each funnel to distort in both the @xmath9 and @xmath63 directions in order to try to form triangular ordering on a local scale , and thus the response of the system differs at different matching fields .",
    "simulations and experiments on single mesoscopic triangular superconducting samples have shown that the vortices can form triangular or partially ordered configurations at magic fillings such as @xmath64 , 6.0 , and @xmath65.@xcite at these matching fields , we find weak or missing commensuration peaks in the funnel geometry , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the high symmetry of these well ordered states results in poor pinning of the vortices in the easy - flow direction since it allows some vortices to simultaneously align along the @xmath9 axis of the channel while closely approaching the narrow aperture of the funnel .",
    "the alignment of the vortices produces an additional @xmath9-direction force on the vortex closest to the funnel tip , permitting it to flow out of the funnel at a relatively low driving force .",
    "in contrast , at commensurate fillings where the vortices adopt partially disordered configurations or have degenerate ground states , the critical current is high .",
    "this is likely due to the lack of a well - defined easy shear direction for the disordered vortices .",

    "the experiments of ref .",
    "@xcite revealed a finite critical depinning force at low fields .",
    "since the experimental channels are less than @xmath8 wide , this finite critical force could be the result of a bowing effect in the center of the funnel channel that creates some effective pinning even for very low fields .",
    "the edge barrier may also be playing a role at low fields , and it is likely that some intrinsic random pinning exists throughout the entire sample which would create a finite @xmath44 at all fields . if the intrinsic pinning is weak , it should be possible to observe the commensuration effects shown in fig .",

    "the peaks in @xmath42 that appear at @xmath125 and @xmath135 for @xmath186 are absent at @xmath185 , indicating that for finite temperatures , pronounced peaks are only observable at the matching fields whereas submatching field peaks are less robust .",
    "the general trend of increasing @xmath44 with increasing @xmath45 also remains robust at finite temperature .",
    "although our work is focused on a superconducting vortex system , we expect our results to be general for other systems of particles with repulsive interactions",
    ". for example , in colloidal systems where the volume density is sufficiently low that steric contact of the colloidal particles does not occur , many of the same results should still apply .",
    "one aspect of the vortex system that we do not take into account is the possibility of multi - quanta vortex formation under certain conditions . in static systems ,",
    "the formation of giant vortices has been observed in cases where the giant vortices produce a higher symmetry of the vortex configuration , such as in quasiperiodic pinning arrays.@xcite it is possible that dynamical multi - quanta vortices could form in a funnel geometry .",
    "for example , if two vortices are forced into close proximity near the funnel tip , they could merge to form a two - quanta vortex which would then pass through the funnel tip .",
    "the formation of such dynamical multi - quanta vortices could produce interesting signatures in the transport curves .",
    "the experimental system closest to the system studied here is periodic asymmetric channel geometries @xcite where small oscillations in the critical current due to commensuration effects were observed . since these commensuration effects were very weak , it is possible that they were due to edge effects .",
    "more recent experiments with geometries that avoid the effect of edges have now revealed much more prominent commensuration effects,@xcite indicating that some of the phases we observe may be occurring in this system .",
    "in summary , we have used numerical simulations to examine the vortex configurations and dynamics in a periodic funnel array .",
    "the vortex configurations we observe are generally different from those found for a single isolated triangular sample due to the coupling between vortices in adjacent funnels . as a function of field",
    "we find a series of depinning threshold peaks at the matching fields where the vortex configurations are ordered . in some cases , matching peaks are missing due to the fact that the vortex configuration contains pairs of vortices that are located close together near the funnel apertures .",
    "we also observe a general increase in the depinning threshold with increasing vortex density , which is opposite from the normal trend for vortices in two - dimensional pinning arrays where the vortices are directly trapped by pinning sites . in the funnel geometry ,",
    "the pinning is a result of the repulsive vortex - vortex interaction forces , and as the vortex density increases it becomes more difficult for the vortices to overcome these repulsive forces and flow through the funnel tip .",
    "we also find a rich variety of dynamical phases , including ordered elastic and ordered plastic phases where the vortices follow fixed trajectories and disordered phases where vortices mix chaotically .",
    "the phases generally organize in such a way that only one vortex passes through the tip of the funnel at a time . due to this constraint",
    ", the average velocity of an individual vortex decreases with increasing field such that the sum of the velocities of all of the vortices at fixed drive remains close to constant for increasing field rather than increasing with increasing field .",
    "this behavior is similar to the response of grains in an hourglass .",
    "transitions between the different dynamical phases appear as jumps or cusps in the velocity - force curves , and there are even regimes where the average vortex motion decreases with increasing drive , producing a negative differential conductivity . at higher fields , moving states can form in which a single vortex remains immobile at the center of a funnel while other vortices flow around it",
    ". in general , ordered flow phases occur at the matching fields , while at non - matching fields the flow is disordered for at least some regime of driving forces .",
    "the ordered phases are associated with sharp narrow band or washboard velocity noise signals while the disordered phases have @xmath187 velocity noise spectra .",
    "our results should also be generalizable to other systems of repulsively interacting particles moving through a funnel geometry , such as colloids or wigner crystals .",
