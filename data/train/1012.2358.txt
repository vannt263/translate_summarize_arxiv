    "the experimental total cross sections  @xcite in the bragg - scattering region display a  certain number of pronounced peaks .",
    "their heights decrease when sd@xmath2 temperature is rising from 8  k to 18  k. however , for a fixed crystal , the structure of bragg peaks does not practically change with varying temperature . it is well known that sd@xmath2 at such temperatures and under low pressure has the hcp structure  @xcite , which has been confirmed using the raman spectroscopy  @xcite",

    "the magnitudes of the theoretical peaks are too large .",
    "also , these peaks are sharp , while the experimental peaks are quite broad . moreover , the observed and calculated locations of the bragg peaks do not fully coincide .",

    "a calculation of the cross sections presented in this paper includes both the elastic and inelastic processes in the sd@xmath2 lattice and in d@xmath2 molecules .",
    "rotational and vibrational transitions in these molecules , which are due to collisions with neutrons , are taken into account .",
    "interactions of neutrons with phonons are described in the incoherent approximation while the incoherent and coherent elastic cross sections are treated separately . the coherent elastic scattering of neutrons is considered both for the random polycrystalline hcp structure and for different orientations of the hcp monocrystal .",
    "the calculated total cross sections are compared with the available data for the neutron wavelengths @xmath0  19    @xcite , with the experimental uncertainty of neutron wavelength taken into account . since this uncertainty is much smaller than the observed widths of the bragg peaks  @xcite , an explanation of this effect by the presence of mosaic imperfections in the sd@xmath2 crystals",
    "is studied .",
    "most crystals are perfect only in very small domains ( mosaic blocks ) on the order of 1000   , which are separated by displacements and distortions in the lattice .",

    "such angular deviations are usually well - described by a gaussian distribution  @xcite .",
    "the mosaic spread may reach even a  few degrees in certain crystals .",

    "the experimental bragg cross sections for the sd@xmath2 crystals , obtained by freezing d@xmath2 gas and two samples of liquid d@xmath2 , are different  @xcite . in this paper",

    "the partial differential cross section for neutron scattering in sd@xmath2 can be expressed in terms of the van hove response function  @xmath3  @xcite , which depends on the target properties for fixed momentum transfer and energy transfers .",

    "a  contribution from the bragg scattering to the calculated total cross section at @xmath117  k is scaled by the factor of  0.5 .",
    "[ fig : monotemp],width=340 ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : monotemp ] , the calculated total cross sections for the `` liquid  2 '' sample at 8  k and 18  k are compared with the experimental cross sections . a qualitative agreement of theory and experiment is achieved here by scaling the 8-k bragg cross section by a factor of  0.5 .",
    "the calculated cross sections for cold neutron scattering in solid deuterium are in a reasonable agreement with the experimental data , if it is assumed that the sd@xmath2 targets are composed of limited numbers of mosaic monocrystals with the mosaic spread of about  @xmath1 .",
    "in particular , this naturally explains the presence of different bragg patterns in the sd@xmath2 samples which are grown separately , although under very similar conditions .",
    "such patterns are due to various orientations of the monocrystals , with respect to the impinging neutron beam . the magnitude of incoherent cross section and its variation with temperature is well described by the theory . on the other hand , the magnitude of measured coherent elastic cross section decreases strongly with rising temperature , which is not revealed by the theory .",
    "a  possible explanation of this disagreement is that the kinematic diffusion theory is not valid for comparison of the theoretical cross sections with the experimental cross sections , which are determined using the neutron - beam attenuation method .",
    "although the presented cross sections have been calculated in the bragg - scattering region , the conclusions regarding the sd@xmath2 structure are of importance for scattering of ultracold neutrons and thus for developing high - intensity ucn sources .",
    "the phonon annihilation in ortho - d@xmath2 is a  crucial process which leads to ucn upscattering and , therefore , limits the effectiveness of sd@xmath2 converters .",
    "since the amplitude of neutron scattering from deuterium is mostly coherent , it is necessary to take into account a real target structure in the ucn - energy region . in estimations of the coherent phonon annihilation , the polycrystalline approach and neglecting crystal imperfections",
    "may lead to strong disagreement between theory and experiment .",
    "figure  2 of ref .",
    "@xcite , which shows strong changes of the ucn cross sections for different 5-k sd@xmath2 samples , is an example of such disagreement .",
