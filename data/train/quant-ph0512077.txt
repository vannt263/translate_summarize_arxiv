    "if the lower bound in an uncertainty relation is state dependent , states satisfying the equality in the uncertainty relation need not give a minimum in the uncertainty product .",
    "this contrasts to the heisenberg uncertainty principle for position and momentum @xcite , where the lower bound is a constant . here ,",
    "states which satisfy the equality in the uncertainty relation , that is intelligent states @xcite , also minimize the uncertainty product .",
    "the uncertainty relation for angular momentum and angle @xcite however , has a state dependent lower bound requiring a distinction between intelligent states and minimum uncertainty product states @xcite .",
    "these two kinds of states are defined as solutions of two different eigenvalue equations . for",
    "linear momentum and position the solutions to the two differential equations are the same gaussians . in the angular case",
    "the two eigenvalue equations have two distinct solutions .",
    "additionally , the angle is defined on a finite interval , allowing solutions to the differential equation which are disregarded in the linear case on the grounds that they do not represent physical , normalisable states on the infinite range on which position and linear momentum are defined .",
    "these solutions are peaked at the edges of the @xmath0 radian interval for the angle and consequently the angle uncertainty of these states tends to be larger than for cases where the wavefunction is peaked in the middle of the interval and decays towards the boundaries .",
    "the intelligent and minimum uncertainty product states thus appear in two varieties with small and large angle uncertainties .",
    "the distinction is most apparent for the uncertainty product , which is bounded from above by @xmath1 for the states with small angle uncertainty , but has no upper bound in the large - uncertainty case .",
    "we should stress that in this work we will consider only the uncertainties in the angular momentum and in the associated angular coordinate @xcite .",
    "this form of the uncertainty relation has been demonstrated to hold in a recent experiment @xcite and underlies the security of a lately developed free - space communication system @xcite .",
    "a range of other uncertainty relations have been derived in which measures of angular spread other than the angle uncertainty are used .",
    "these includes uncertainties based on trigonometric functions of the angle @xcite , discrete versions of the uncertainty relation @xcite and entropic uncertainty relations @xcite .",
    "the family of states related to the angular uncertainty relation has been investigated in a series of previous articles .",
    "the form of the angular uncertainty relation has been experimentally verified using intelligent states with small angle uncertainties @xcite .",
    "the distinction between intelligent states and minimum uncertainty states with small uncertainties has been presented in a second article @xcite , where the possibility has been discussed to distinguish between these in an experiment .",
    "intelligent states with large uncertainties have been introduced in a third article @xcite , in which we have compared the analytically exact expression for the wavefunction in terms of a special function with approximate expressions for two limiting cases .",
    "the present article completes the study of this family of states by expounding minimum uncertainty product states with large uncertainties .",
    "as the angle is defined on a finite interval its uncertainty is bounded from above and the uncertainty product reaches the global minimum for eigenstates of the angular momentum operator @xmath2 with uncertainty @xmath3 .",
    "but one can also consider states which minimize the uncertainty product under the constraint of a given uncertainty in either the angle or the angular momentum .",
    "it has been shown that states minimizing the uncertainty product are the same whether the additional constraint is a given uncertainty in the angle @xmath4 or a given uncertainty in the angular momentum @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "these states are called constrained minimum uncertainty product ( cmup ) states .    in this article",
    "we will extend the analysis of cmup states to the large - uncertainty regime .",
    "an exact analytical solution for the wavefunction of these states will be given in terms of complex confluent hypergeometric functions , but we also present an approximate solution in terms of airy functions for the limiting case where the given angle uncertainty @xmath4 tends to its upper bound @xmath6 . in particular we will compare this kind of cmup states with the large - uncertainty intelligent states .",
    "it is physically impossible to distinguish between two rotation angles differing by @xmath7 radians . within the quantum mechanical description of rotation angles ,",
    "this restricts angle eigenvalues to lie within a @xmath7 radian interval [ @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "choosing @xmath9 determines a particular @xmath7 radian interval and with it a particular angle operator @xmath10 and hence a basis set of angle eigenstates . in the following we adhere to the choice of @xmath9 used in previous work @xcite by setting @xmath11 and dropping the label on the angle operator @xmath12 .",
    "the lower bound in the general form of the uncertainty relation for two hermitian operators is given by the expectation value of the commutator of these operators @xcite .",
    "the commutator for angle and angular momentum operator is rigorously derived in a finite state space @xmath13 of @xmath14 dimensions , spanned by the eigenstates @xmath15 of the angular momentum operator @xmath2 with @xmath16 ranging from @xmath17 @xcite . only after physical results",
    "have been calculated in the finite dimensional space @xmath13 , @xmath18 is allowed to tend to infinity .",
    "it is in this limit of @xmath19 that the expectation value of the commutator @xmath20 $ ] can be approximated to an excellent degree for all physical preparable states , which results in the angular uncertainty relation @xmath21 here , we are using units in which @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the angle probability density at the edge of the chosen @xmath7 radian interval .",
    "this corresponds to our choice of @xmath11 , as the probability density is periodic in the angle and @xmath24 . in general different states",
    "used to calculate the uncertainties @xmath5 and @xmath4 will have a different angle probability density @xmath23 rendering the lower bound in the uncertainty relation ( [ eq : aur ] ) state dependent . from the uncertainty relation ( [ eq : aur ] ) it is evident why angular momentum eigenstates give a global minimum for the uncertainty product . for an eigenstate of the angular momentum operator the angle probability density takes on the constant value of @xmath25 for @xmath26 in @xmath27 .",
    "the lower bound in the uncertainty relation thus is equal to zero and so is the uncertainty product as the angular momentum uncertainty vanishes and the angle uncertainty has the finite value of @xmath28 .",
    "this global minimum in the uncertainty product is also the dividing point between small - uncertainty and large - uncertainty states .",
    "away from this point the constrained minimum uncertainty product ( cmup ) states give a minimum in the uncertainty product for a given @xmath4 or a given @xmath5 .",
    "seeking states which minimize the uncertainty product for a given uncertainty in the angle or for a given uncertainty in the angular momentum is equivalent to minimizing the uncertainty that is not given .",
    "the corresponding equation for cmup states has been derived in @xcite using a variational method @xcite . in this approach",
    "it is required that a cmup state @xmath29 minimizes the uncertainty product , but with the constraint of keeping the given variance constant and obeying the normalisation condition @xmath30 .",
    "the additional constraints are taken into account by introducing undetermined lagrange multipliers @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it has been shown that for a cmup state @xmath29 the mean values of angular momentum and angle can be set to zero , that is @xmath31 .",
    "therefore , the variances @xmath32 and @xmath33 simplify to @xmath34 and @xmath35 respectively .",
    "the variation of the uncertainty product with the given constraints thus results in a linear combination of the variations @xmath36 and @xmath37 , in which the lagrange multipliers are the coefficients : @xmath38 the linear combination is the same whether @xmath34 is given and @xmath35 is minimized or @xmath35 is given and @xmath34 is minimized .",
    "furthermore , it has also been demonstrated @xcite that it is admissible to consider only real coefficients @xmath39 in the angular momentum decomposition of @xmath29 in the state space @xmath13 @xmath40 this allows us to write the variation @xmath41 for any hermitian operator @xmath42 as @xmath43 @xcite . in particular this",
    "applies to the operators @xmath44 and to the identity operator @xmath45 corresponding to the variations @xmath46 and @xmath37 .",
    "the linear combination of variations in ( [ eq : lincombvar ] ) thus turns into a linear combination of operators applied to @xmath29 .",
    "this leads to an eigenvalue equation of the form @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the lagrange multipliers .",
    "the identification of the angular momentum operator @xmath2 as derivative with respect to @xmath26 sets additional requirements on the wavefunction representing cmup states @xcite .",
    "the wavefunction in the angle representation @xmath50 has to be an element of @xmath51 , which is the set of continuously differentiable functions .",
    "the question of differentiability is of particular importance at the boundaries of the @xmath7 radian interval , on which the angle wavefunction is defined .",
    "whereas intelligent states are continuous , they do not have a continuous first derivative at @xmath52 .",
    "cmup states , however , do have a continuous first derivative at the boundaries , and therefore representing @xmath53 by the differential operator @xmath54 is well defined . the eigenvalue equation ( [ eq : eigenvaleq ] )",
    "may thus be turned into a differential equation for the cmup wavefunction @xmath55 : @xmath56 for the small - uncertainty case a solution of this equation has been given in terms of a confluent hypergeometric function in reference @xcite .",
    "the angle wavefunction in this regime is peaked at @xmath57 and @xmath58 such that the curvature of the wavefunction around @xmath57 is negative .",
    "for the large - uncertainty case the curvature around the central region is positive and the multipliers @xmath59 .",
    "formally we can give the solution to ( [ eq : cmupdiffeq ] ) in terms of confluent hypergeometric functions with complex arguments : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is kumer s function @xcite .",
    "this solution is obtained from ( [ eq : cmupdiffeq ] ) by setting @xmath62 and @xmath63 for @xmath64 and using the same scaling as in @xcite , independent of the sign of @xmath48 and @xmath49 : @xmath65 and @xmath66 . with these substitutions ( [ eq : cmupdiffeq ] ) takes on the form @xmath67 of which ( [ eq : comphypergeo ] ) is a solution with the appropriate change of variables . to evaluate the wavefunction and to calculate the angle and angular momentum uncertainty we have solved the scaled differential equation ( [ eq : scaleddiffeq ] ) numerically using a series expansion . in the scaled form",
    "the wavefunction is characterized by the parameter @xmath68 which takes on positive values for large - uncertainty cmup states .",
    "the appropriate scaling is determined by the condition that the position @xmath69 of the first maximum of @xmath70 corresponds to @xmath71 , such that @xmath72 the value of @xmath69 is determined numerically , so that the scaled wavefunction can be normalised between @xmath73 and @xmath69 allowing a calculation of the expectation value @xmath74 by numerical integration .",
    "the transition of the wavefunction for the cmup states from the small - uncertainty regime to the large - uncertainty regime is shown in figure [ fig : wavefunction ] . in connection with figure [ fig : wavefunction ]",
    "it is useful to discuss qualitatively the consequences of the positive curvature in the central region of the wavefunction for the large - uncertainty cmup states on the angle uncertainty . in @xcite",
    "it has been shown that for cmup states with small @xmath4 the single - peaked wavefunction has approximately the form of a gaussian .",
    "on increasing the scaling parameter @xmath68 towards zero the wavefunction becomes flater and deviates from the gaussian form . for @xmath75 the wavefunction is uniformly distributed between @xmath76 and @xmath6 and the angle uncertainty takes on the value of @xmath77 .",
    "this is the dividing point between the small - uncertainty and large - uncertainty regime .",
    "if the parameter @xmath68 is further increased then the curvature turns positive and the wavefunction is peaked at @xmath78 .",
    "calculating the uncertainty or for such a cmup state from the variance @xmath79 yields values for @xmath80 . in the limit of @xmath81",
    "the angle uncertainty approaches the maximum value @xmath6 @xcite . in this limit",
    ", the @xmath7-periodic angle probability distribution has a narrow peak centred at @xmath71 .",
    "the width of this peak is _ not _ @xmath4 but rather the uncertainty in a different angle variable having a different range of allowed angles ( for example @xmath82 to @xmath7 ) .",
    "the angle uncertainty for a given state depends on this choice of allowed angles in precisely the same way as does the phase uncertainty for a harmonic osscillator or a single electromagnetic field mode @xcite .",
    "plot of the wavefunction of cmup states showing the transition from the small - uncertainty regime to the large - uncertainty regime .",

    "the variance of the angular momentum operator is given by ( [ eq : cmupdiffeq ] ) in terms of @xmath86 and @xmath35 , which results in the following expression for the product of the variances @xmath35 and @xmath34 : @xmath87 the limiting behaviour of the uncertainty product is directly connected to the behaviour of the ratio @xmath88 . for @xmath68 tending to zero , @xmath49 and @xmath48 tend to zero individually but their ratio @xmath89 ( see figure [ fig : mulambda ] ) .",
