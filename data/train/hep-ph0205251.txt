    "strange quark matter has attracted a lot of interest since witten suggested that it could be absolutely stable even at zero temperature and pressure @xcite .",
    "the investigation of such a possibility is relevant not only for high energy physics , but also for astrophysics .",
    "for example , the core of a neutron star may be composed of quark matter .",
    "the possible existence of strange stars which are made entirely of deconfined u , d and s quarks is one of the most intriguing aspects of modern astrophysics .",
    "there have been some reports of events with a @xmath1 350 - 500 and z @xmath1 10 - 20 in cosmic ray experiments @xcite-@xcite , the so - called exotic cosmic ray events .",
    "also , recent studies have shown that x - ray burst sources are likely strange star candidates @xcite-@xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to produce strange quark matter ( strangelets ) in the laboratory because they could serve as a signature of the formation of the quark - gluon - plasma which is a direct demonstration of qcd @xcite-@xcite .",
    "many ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collision experiments at brookhaven and cern @xcite are proposed to search for ( meta)stable lumps of such kind of strangelets .",
    "recently , ardouin et al.@xcite presented a novel method which can be applied to characterize the possible existence of a strange quark matter distillation process in heavy - ion collisions . up to now",
    ", there is no experiment which confirms the existence of strangelets .",
    "for example , the e864 collaboration found that there is no evidence for strangelet production in 11.5gev / c per nucleon au+pb collisions @xcite .    besides the experimental efforts , there are also a lot of theoretical investigations of the stability of strange quark matter .",
    "the earliest discussions are based on the mit bag model @xcite which assumes that quarks are confined by a phenomenological bag . within the bag quarks",
    "are asymptotically free .",
    "calculations @xcite within this model indicate that there is a range of parameters in which strange quark matter is absolutely stable , i.e. the energy per baryon is less than @xmath2 mev .",
    "the stability of strange quark matter with finite volume ( strangelets ) was also discussed in the mit bag model .",
    "berger and jaffe @xcite discussed the surface correction for the strangelets , where they found that the surface tension destabilizes strangelets .",
    "the curvature contribution was considered by madsen @xcite which is dominant for strangelets with small baryon numbers .",
    "though the bag model is simple , it is an incomplete description of confinement .",
    "results from lattice calculations @xcite show that quark matter does not become asymptotically free and some hadronic degrees of freedom remain within the quark matter immediately after the phase transition .",
    "fowler , raha and weiner @xcite suggested another description of the confinement mechanism via the introduction of a density - dependent quark mass .",
    "this quark mass - density - dependent ( qmdd ) model was first employed to study the properties of ordinary quark matter @xcite and then applied to the investigation of strange quark matter @xcite-@xcite . as was pointed in our recent paper @xcite , their thermodynamic treatment was not correct .",
    "we reconsidered strange quark matter in the self - consistent quark mass density dependent model and found a region of parameters in which the strange quark matter is absolutely stable .",
    "in the qmdd model , the concept of a density dependent quark mass has no dynamical origin . in recent years",
    ", some approaches for strange quark matter based on dynamical models were developed .",
    "alberico et al .",
    "@xcite utilized the color dielectric model to calculate the energy per baryon of strange quark matter .",
    "they found that while the double minimum version of the color dielectric model allowed the existence of strangelets , the single minimum version of this model excluded the possibility .",
    "stability of strange quark matter was also investigated using the effective 4-quark interactions @xcite , the su(3 ) nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model with and without 4-quark vector type interactions @xcite . in studying hadronic matter , we proposed a chiral su(3 ) quark mean field model .",
    "this chiral quark model was applied to investigate the properties of strange hadronic matter and multi - strange hadronic systems @xcite . in this paper , we want to use this model to discuss the stability of strange quark matter .",
    "the difference between quark and hadronic matter is that in quark matter , the u , d , s quarks are deconfined and not combined into baryons by the confining potential .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we introduce the basic model features .",

    "the stable strange quark matter can only exist in the core of these objects where the pressure is high enough to force the transition from hadronic matter to quark matter to occur .",

    "compared to the qmdd model , here the effective quark masses are obtained dynamically .",
    "the quark masses are not only density dependent but also strangeness fraction dependent which are not present in the qmdd model .",

    "the solid and dashed lines are for parameter sets a and b , respectively .",

    "this is close to the qmdd model or su(3 ) njl model with only scalar type 4-quark interactions . in fig.4 , for parameter set a , there exists a local minimum of energy per baryon for any @xmath93 .",
    "the baryon density at the minimum of energy per baryon first increases and then decreases when @xmath93 increases .",
    "for nonstrange quark matter , though there is a local minimum , the system has no positive binding energy compared to the vacuum mass of nonstrange quarks . for strange quark",
    "matter , the energy per baryon is lower than the masses of hyperons with the same strangeness number . when @xmath95 , the binding energy is about 45 mev compared to the vacuum constituent quark mass .",
    "the maximum binding energy is about 60 mev and the corresponding @xmath93 is about 2.0 .",
    "metastable strange quark matter is therefore favored to have a large strangeness fraction ( high negative charge ) . for the parameter set b",
    ", the system has a local minimum of energy per baryon only for some range of @xmath93 , that is @xmath96 .",
    "the maximum binding energy is about 5 mev , when @xmath93 is around 2.0 .",
    "when the interactions between quarks and vector mesons are included , the system is destabilized .",
    "in fig.5 , we plot the energy per baryon versus baryon density with the vector coupling constant half of that in hadronic matter . compared to fig.4 ,",
    "the energy per baryon becomes higher .",
    "for parameter set a , there exists a local minimum for @xmath97 .",
    "the maximum binding energy is only about 10 mev with @xmath98 1.0 .",
    "the corresponding density is also much lower compared to fig.4 . for parameter set b",
    ", there is no local minimum for any strangeness fraction .",
    "if the vector coupling is the same as in hadronic matter , as is shown in fig.6 , the energy per baryon will increase monotonously with the baryon density for both parameter sets a and b. the vector meson couplings are also discussed in ref . @xcite .",
    "though these two models are quite different , the results are comparable to each other .    if vector interactions are included , even when the strength is only half of that in hadronic matter , the binding energy of metastable strange quark matter becomes small or negative . at the minimum of the energy per baryon , the pressure p of",

    "this kind of objects with finite volume are called strangelets .",
    "if the vector interactions are fully considered , the metastable strangelets can not be formed at zero pressure .    up to now",
    ", we did not consider the additional coupling between strange quark and scalar mesons @xmath38 , which is important to obtain reasonable hyperon potentials in hadronic matter @xcite .",

    "the result for the strange quark mass evidently change , especially for large strangeness fraction , when compared to fig.3 . in nonstrange",
    "quark matter , the effective mass of s quarks almost stays constant .",
    "when the strangeness fraction is high , the strange quark has a lower mass when compared to fig.3 , where @xmath38 is not included    the effective quark masses will affect the energy of the system . in fig.8 we plot the energy per baryon versus density with the vector coupling constant half of that in hadronic matter .",

    "the results of these two cases are close . for large strangeness fraction ,",
    "the additional term @xmath38 will produce larger binding energy .",
    "if the vector coupling strength is as big as in hadronic matter , there is no local minimum for both cases , with or without @xmath38 .",
    "therefore , the inclusion of the additional term @xmath38 does not affect the main results of fig.1 .",
    "this is because when the @xmath0-equilibrium is achieved , the strangeness fraction of the system is smaller than 1 .",
    "the additional term @xmath38 only gives sizable contributions for systems with a large strangeness fraction .",
    "we investigate strange quark matter in a chiral su(3 ) quark mean field model .",
    "the effective quark masses are obtained dynamically by the quark meson interactions and they are both density and strangeness fraction dependent . the stability of strange quark matter is studied for different values of the vector coupling constant and for different parameter sets .",
    "the effect of the additional term @xmath38 is also discussed .",
    "if the strange quark is stable and can survive a long time , the @xmath0-equilibrium can be achieved . the strangeness fraction @xmath93 is smaller than 1 . in the chiral su(3 ) quark model , at the density where the system has a local minimum for the energy per baryon , no strange quarks appear . even without the vector meson coupling ,",
    "this nonstrange quark matter has a negative binding energy and can not be bound .",
    "therefore , opposed to the suggestion by witten , stable quark matter at zero pressure can not exist even without vector meson interactions .",
    "if quark matter can be produced in heavy ion collisions , the @xmath0-equilibrium may not be achieved .",
    "this metastable strange quark matter can have a high strangeness fraction ( high negative charge ) .",
    "when we do not take the vector meson interaction into account , as in the qmdd model or su(3 ) njl model with only scalar type 4-quark interaction , the maximum binding energy is about 5 mev - 60 mev and the corresponding strangeness fraction is about 1 - 2 . if we assume that the strength of vector meson coupling is half of that in hadronic matter ( in this case , the strength of vector coupling is comparable to the one of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , the maximum binding energy decreases .",
    "inclusion of the additional term @xmath38 will forces the system to have a larger strangeness fraction and binding energy . when the vector coupling constant is the same as for hadronic matter , no metastable strange quark matter ( strangelets ) can be formed in heavy ion collisions .",
    "however , strange quark matter can still exist in the core of a neutron star .",
    "the phase transition from hadronic matter to quark matter can occur at high density and pressure which is caused by gravity . because both hadronic and quark matter can be described in the su(3 )",
    "quark mean field model , it is of interest to investigate this phase transition in this model .",
