    "the idea of using gravitational lenses with time delays between the various images of a background quasar as a cosmological probe was first suggested by refsdal ( 1964 ) .",
    "null geodesics originating with distant variable sources have different optical paths and pass through dissimilar gravitational potentials .",
    "their deflection angles and time delays can thus be used to infer lens - system dependent angular - diameter distances , which can then be compared to theoretical predictions from general relativity to test the background cosmological expansion and offer the possibility of testing competing models ( see , e.g. , petters et al .",
    "2001 ; schneider et al .",

    ", time delays have been observed from 21 lensed quasars , a relatively small subset of the several hundred known strong - lens systems .",
    "but this is only the beginning . in the near future , observational programmes , such as the cosmological monitoring of gravitational lenses ( cosmograil ; eigenbrod et al .",
    "2005 ) and perhaps also the international liquid mirror telescope ( ilmt ) project ( jean et al .",
    "2001 ) , which is now in the final phases of construction in the kumaun region of the himalayas ( sagar et al .",
    "2013 ) , should increase this sample considerably .",
    "new strong gravitational lens systems will also be discovered by cosmic structure surveys , including the dark energy survey median fwhm in the r , i , and z band images for its wide survey . at the end of the first year , the quality is close to this , though not yet meeting expectations .",
    "in addition , g and y bands are observed in poorer seeing conditions so their quality is even lower ( bernstein 2014 ) .",
    "this is an important consideration in any discussion concerning anticipated sample size , given that even sdss has discovered only @xmath7 of the originally expected lens systems . ]",

    "; blandford et al . 2006 ; marshall et al .",
    "2011 ; chang et al .",
    "2014 ) project , and the vst atlas survey ( koposov et al .",
    "2014 ) , and time delays will be measured for a sub - sample of these with subsequent monitoring observations .",
    "oguri & marshall ( 2010 ) carried out a detailed calculation of the likely yields of several planned surveys , using realistic distributions for the lens and source properties and taking magnification bias and image configuration detectability into account .",
    "they found that upcoming wide - field synoptic surveys should detect several thousand lensed quasars . in particular , lsst should find more than @xmath88,000 lensed quasars , some 3,000 of which will have well - measured time delays .",
    "several attempts have already been made to demonstrate the usefulness of these data for constraining the cosmological parameters in the standard model , @xmath0cdm ( see , e.g. , paraficz & hjorth 2009 , 2010 ; balms & corasaniti 2013 ; and suyu et al . 2013 ) . in this paper",
    ", we broaden the base of support for this cosmic probe by demonstrating its usefulness in testing _ competing",
    "_ cosmological models .",
    "in particular , we show that the currently available sample of time - delay lensing systems favors the @xmath2 universe with a likelihood of @xmath1 of being correct , versus @xmath3 for @xmath0cdm .",
    "though this result is still only marginal , it nonetheless calls for a significant increase in the sample of suitable lensing systems in order to carry out more sophisticated and higher precision measurements .    in   2 , we describe the key theoretical steps used in the application of time - delay lenses for cosmological testing , and we apply this procedure to the currently known sample of 12 systems in   3 .",
    "we discuss the results of our one - on - one comparison between @xmath0cdm and @xmath2 in ",
    "as we shall see , model selection tools favor the latter , but the distinction , given the relatively small number of lenses , is still not strong enough to completely rule out either model .",
    "we therefore estimate the sample size required from future surveys to reach likelihoods of @xmath4 and @xmath9 , for a @xmath10 confidence limit , and we present our conclusions in   6 .",
    "the measurement of time delays in strong gravitational lenses is not straightforward , due in part to the uncertainty associated with the lens mass distribution and the possible presence of other perturbing masses along the line - of - sight . to this point ,",
    "two principal methods have been employed to model the lens itself , which may be characterized as either simple - parametric ( see , e.g. , oguri et al . 2002 ; keeton et al .",
    "2003 ) or grid - based parametric ( see , e.g. , warren & dye 2003 ; bradac et al . 2008 ; coles 2008 ; suyu et al .",
    "2013 ) approaches .",
    "the former uses simply - parametrized forms for the mass distribution of the deflector , while the latter uses as parameters a grid of pixels , to describe either the potential or the mass distribution of the deflector , and/or the source surface brightness distribution .",
    "some have also used a hybrid approach , in which pixellated corrections were made to a simply parametrized mass model ( suyu et al .",
    "2010 ; vegetti et al . 2010 ) .",
    "the grid - based methods are regularized , often by imposing physical priors , otherwise they would just fit the noise .",
    "the simply parametrized methods can even be computationally more intensive , depending on the choice of the parameters . if an appropriate sub - sample of homogeneous systems can be identified  meaning a set of lenses whose properties provide evidence that the same lens model description may be used with the same level of statistical significance ",
    "the simply parametrized method can serve as an ideal first attempt at gauging whether the image - inversion effort is warranted with follow - up analysis .",
    "this is the method we will be using in this paper .    for a given image @xmath11 at angular position @xmath12 , with the source position at angle @xmath13 ,",
    "the time delay , @xmath14 , is the combined effect of the difference in path length between the straight and deflected rays , and the gravitational time dilation for the ray passing through the effective gravitational potential of the lens , @xmath15 : @xmath16\\ ] ] ( see , e.g. , blandford & narayan 1986 , and references cited therein ) , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the lens and source redshifts , respectively , and @xmath19 is the angular - diameter distance between redshifts @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "if the lens geometry @xmath22 and the lens potential @xmath23 are known , the time delay measures the ratio @xmath24 also known as the time - delay distance , which depends on the cosmological model .",
    "it has been known for over a decade that lens spiral and elliptical galaxies have a mass distribution that is well approximated by power - law density profiles ( witt et al .",
    "2000 ; rusin et al . 2003 ) , for which the lens potential may be written @xmath25 in terms of the deflection scale @xmath26 and index @xmath27 .",
    "the single isothermal sphere ( sis ) is the special case corresponding to @xmath28 , for which @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the velocity dispersion of the lensing galaxy .",
    "though some systems have shallow profiles with @xmath31 , measurements of galaxy density distributions suggest that @xmath27 is generally close to the isothermal value .",
    "thus , in addition to the sis model being convenient for its simplicity , it is actually also a surprisingly useful and accurate model for lens galaxies ( guimaraes & sodr 2009 ; koopmans et al .",
    "2009 ) . and for such systems with only two images at @xmath32 and @xmath33 ,",
    "the time delay is given by the expression @xmath34    treu et al .",
    "( 2006 ) found that the ratio @xmath35 is very close to unity , where @xmath36 includes systematic errors in the rms deviation of the velocity dispersion and a softened isothermal sphere potential ( see additional details below ) .",
    "note that if the velocity dispersion @xmath30 of the lensing galaxy could also be observed , and assuming a ratio @xmath37 , two of the angular - diameter distances appearing in equation  ( 2 ) could be replaced with the measured value of @xmath30 and the einstein radius @xmath38 .",
    "an alternative approach would be to impose some prior ( see , e.g. , oguri 2007 ) , or to compute @xmath30 from a dynamical model ( see , e.g. , treu & koopmans 2002 ) . as shown by paraficz & hjorth ( 2009 ) , the quantity @xmath39 is more sensitive to the cosmological parameters than @xmath40 or @xmath41 separately , so this additional datum would improve the reliability with which this approach could distinguish between competing models . as of today , however , there are simply too few time - delay lenses with the corresponding measure of @xmath30 , so all of the analysis we carry out in this paper will be based solely on the use of equation  ( 4 ) . even looking to the future , velocity dispersions are particularly difficult to measure for these systems precisely because they are crowded by quasars that make the time delay measurement possible .    in @xmath0cdm ,",
    "the angular - diameter distance depends on several parameters , including @xmath42 and the mass fractions @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 , defined in terms of the current matter ( @xmath46 ) , radiation ( @xmath47 ) , and dark energy ( @xmath48 ) densities , and the critical density @xmath49 . assuming zero spatial curvature , so that @xmath50 , the angular - diameter distance between redshifts @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( @xmath51 ) is given by the expression @xmath52^{-1/2}\\;dz\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is the dark - energy equation of state .",
    "thus , the essential free parameters in flat @xmath0cdm are @xmath42 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( since radiation is insignificant at gravitational lensing redshifts ) . in the @xmath2 universe ( melia 2007 ; melia & shevchuk 2012 )",
    ", the angular - diameter distance depends only on @xmath42 . in this cosmology , @xmath56",
    "in their careful bayesian approach to constraining @xmath42 within the framework of @xmath0cdm , balms & corasaniti ( 2013 ) collected a sample of time - delay lenses for which bayesian selection techniques can identify the lens mass model with the highest probability of describing the lens system .",
    "rather than attempting to model individual lenses in all their complexity , the goal was to identify the model whose parameters significantly influence the time - delay , allowing them to average over individual mass model parameter uncertainties on a homogeneous mass sample .",
    "the first selection criterion in such an approach is therefore a restriction to two - image lenses , listed in table 1 , which seem to be more likely than other lens systems to be consistent with a simple power - law ( or even sis ) profile .",
    "paraficz & hjorth ( 2010 ) followed the alternative method of using inversion techniques with each individual intensity image to map the mass distribution in each individual lens system , and produced a very useful comparison of their mass profiles , shown in figure  1 of that paper .",
    "indeed , the two - image lenses are significantly more symmetric than the rest .",
    "but though the object constituting the lens has been identified unambiguously in all the entries listed in table 1 , it is not yet clear whether these are part of a group or whether perturbators contribute along the line - of - sight .",
    "thus , at this stage , an important caveat to our conclusions is that external shear may yet be contributing to some selection bias .",

    "the logarithmic penalty in this model selection tool strongly suppresses overfitting if @xmath144 is large ( the situation we have here , which is deep in the asymptotic regime ) . with @xmath218 , our analysis of the simulated sample shows that the bic would favor the @xmath2 universe over @xmath0cdm by an overwhelming likelihood of @xmath219 versus only @xmath220 ( i.e. , the prescribed @xmath10 confidence limit ) .      in this case , we assume that the background cosmology is @xmath0cdm , and seek the minimum sample size to rule out @xmath2 at the @xmath10 confidence level . we have found that a minimum of 135 time - delay lenses are required to achieve this goal . to allow for the greatest flexibility in the @xmath0cdm fit , here",

    "up to now , these approaches have been used to optimize parameters in @xmath0cdm itself , but not for an actual one - on - one comparison between competing cosmological models .",
    "this must be done because the results we have presented here already indicate a strong likelihood of being able to discriminate between models such as @xmath0cdm and @xmath2 .",
    "such comparisons have already been made using , e.g. , cosmic chronometers ( melia & maier 2013 ) , gamma - ray bursts ( wei et al . 2013 ) , and type ia sne ( wei et al . 2014 ) .",
    "the use of time - delay lenses introduces yet another standard ruler , with systematics different from those encountered elsewhere , thus providing an invaluable tool with which to cross - check the outcomes of these other important tests .",
    "but though time - delay lens observations currently tend to favor @xmath2 over @xmath0cdm , the known sample of such systems is still too small for us to completely rule out either model .",
    "we have therefore considered two synthetic samples with characteristics similar to those of the 12 known systems , one based on a @xmath0cdm background cosmology , the other on @xmath2 . from the analysis of these simulated lenses ,",
    "we have estimated that a sample of about 150 lenses would be needed to rule out @xmath2 at a @xmath4 confidence level if the real cosmology is in fact @xmath0cdm , while a sample of at least 1,000 systems would be needed to similarly rule out @xmath0cdm if the background cosmology were instead @xmath2 .",
    "the difference in required sample size results from @xmath0cdm s greater flexibility in fitting the data , since it has a larger number of free parameters .",
