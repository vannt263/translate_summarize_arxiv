    "in this paper we study some aspects of physics of fields living and interacting in a manifold @xmath22 . we introduce two different geometrical spacetime structures that we can form starting from the manifold @xmath10 which is supposed to be a vector manifold , i.e. , a submanifold of ( @xmath23 with @xmath24 and @xmath2 a metric of signature @xmath3 .",
    "if @xmath25 is the inclusion map the structures that will be studied are the lorentzian de sitter spacetime @xmath26 and teleparallel de sitter spacetime @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath13 is the levi - civita connection of @xmath5 and @xmath14 is a metric compatible teleparallel connection ( see section 4.1 ) .",
    "our main objective is the following : taking @xmath4 as the arena where physical fields live and interact  how do we formulate conservation laws of energy - momentum and angular momentum for the system of physical fields . in order to give a meaningful meaning to this question we recall the fact that in lorentzian spacetime structures that are models of gravitational fields in the * grt * there are no genuine conservation laws of energy - momentum ( and also angular momentum ) for a closed system of fields and moreover there are no genuine energy - momentum and angular momentum conservation laws for the system consisting of non gravitational plus the gravitational field .",
    "we discuss in section 2.1 a pure mathematical result , namely when there exists some conserved currents @xmath29 @xmath30 in a lorentzian spacetime associated to a tensor field @xmath31 and a vector field @xmath32 . in section 2.2",
    "we briefly recall how a conserved energy - momentum tensor for the matter fields is constructed in special relativity theories and how in that theory it is possible to construct a conserved energy - momentum _ _ covector _ _ _ _ f__or the matter fields . after that we recall that in * grt * we have a covariantly conserved  energy - momentum tensor @xmath33",
    "( i.e. , @xmath34 ) and so , using the results of section 2.1 we can immediately construct conserved currents when the lorentzian spacetime modelling the gravitational field generated by @xmath35 possess killing vector fields .",
    "however , we show that is not possible in general in * grt * even when some special conserved currents exist ( associated to one timelike and three spacelike killing vector fields ) to build a conserved _ covector _ for the system of fields , as it is the case in special relativistic theories . immediately after showing that we ask the question :    is it necessary to have killing vector fields in a lorentzian spacetime modelling a given gravitational field in order to be possible",
    "to construct conserved currents ?",
    "well ,  we show that the answer is _",
    "no_. in * grt * there are an infinite number of conserved currents .",
    "this is showed in section 2.4 were we introduce the so called komar currents in a lorentzian spacetime modelling a gravitational field generated by a given ( symmetric ) energy momentum tensor @xmath35  and show how any diffeomorphism associated to a one parameter group generated by a vector field @xmath17 lead to a conserved current .",
    "we show moreover using the clifford bundle formalism recalled in appendix a that @xmath19 @xmath36 where @xmath37 satisfy , ( with @xmath38 denoting the dirac operator acting on sections of the clifford bundle of differential forms )  a maxwell like equation @xmath39 ( equivalent to @xmath40 and @xmath41 ) .",
    "the explicit form of @xmath42 as a function of the energy - momentum tensor is derived  ( see eq.([kocurr ] ) ) together with its scalar invariant .",
    "we establish that denotes the the dirac operator acting on sections of the clifford bundle @xmath43 .",
    "see appendix a. ] @xmath39 encode the contents of einstein equation .",
    "we show moreover that even if we can get four conserved currents given one time like and three spacelike vector fields and thus get four scalar invariants these objects _ can not _ be associated to the components of a momentum _ _ covector _ _ for the system of fields producing the energy - momentum tensor @xmath35",
    ". we also give the form of @xmath16 when @xmath17 is a killing vector field and emphasize that even if the lorentzian spacetime under consideration has one time like and three spacelike killing vector fields we can not find a conserved momentum covector for the system of fields .",
    "this paper has several appendices necessary for a perfect intelligibility of the results in the main text .",
    "thus it is opportune to describe what is there and where their contents are used in the main text . to start , in appendix a we briefly recall the main results of the clifford bundle formalism used in this paper which permits one to understand how to arrive at the equation @xmath44 in section 2.2 .",
    "using * dhsfs * is given in @xcite . ] .",
    "lie derivatives and variations of tensor fields is discussed in appendix b. in section c1 we derive from the lagrangian formalism conserved currents for fields living in a general lorentzian spacetime structure and the corresponding generalized covariant energy - momentum conservation  law .",
    "we compare these results in section c2 with the analogues ones for field theories in special relativistic theories where the lorentzian spacetime structure is minkowski spacetime .",
    "we show that despite the fact that we can derive conserved quantities for fields living and interacting in @xmath45 we can not define in this structure a genuine energy - momentum conserved covector for the system of fields as it is the case in minkowski spacetime .",
    "a legitimate energy - momentum covector for the system of fields living in @xmath46 exist only in the teleparallel structure @xmath47 .",
    "this is discussed in section 5.2 after recalling the lie algebra and the casimir invariants of the lie algebra of de sitter group in section 5.1 . in appendix",
    "e we derive for completeness and to insert the remark [ dtt=0 ] the so called covariant energy - momentum conservation law in * grt*. appendix d recalls the intrinsic definition of relative tensors and their covariant derivatives .",
    "appendix e present proofs of some identities used in the main text .    as we already said",
    "the main objective of this paper is to discuss the physics of interacting fields in de sitter spacetime structures @xmath15 and @xmath47 .",
    "in particular we want also to clarify some misunderstandings concerning the roles of geodesics in the @xmath48 .",
    "so , in section 3 we briefly recall the conformal representation of the de sitter spacetime  structure @xmath15 and prove that the one timelike and the three spacelike translation  killing vector fields of @xmath4 defines a basis for almost all @xmath10 . with this result",
    "we show in section 4 that the method using in @xcite to obtain the curves which extremizes the length function of timelike curves in de sitter spacetime with the result that these curves are not geodesics is equivocated , since those authors use _ constrained variations _ instead of _ arbitrary variations _ of the length function .",
    "even more , the equation obtained from the constrained variation in @xcite is according to our view wrongly interpreted in its mathematical ( and physical ) contents . indeed , using some of the results of section 5.2 and the results of section 6 which briefly recall papapetrou s classical results @xcite deriving the equation of motion of a probe single - pole particle in * grt * , * * we show in section 7 that contrary to the authors statement in @xcite it is not true that the equation of motion of a single - pole obtained from a method similar to papapetrou s one  in @xcite but using the generalized energy - momentum tensor of matter fields in @xmath15 gives an equation of motion different from the geodesic equation in @xmath15 and in agreement with the one they derived from his constrained variation method .",
    "indeed , we prove that from the equation describing the motion of a single - pole  the geodesic equation follows automatically .",
    "finally , in section 8 we present our conclusions .",
    "let @xmath49 be a general lorentzian spacetime .",
    "let @xmath50 be an open set covered by coordinates @xmath51 .",

    "we introduce also @xmath62 and @xmath63 respectively as the reciprocal bases of @xmath64 and @xmath65 , i.e. , we have @xmath66    next we introduce in @xmath53 the tetrad basis @xmath67 and in @xmath55 the cotetrad basis  @xmath68 which are dual basis .",
    "we introduce moreover the basis @xmath69 and @xmath70 as the reciprocal bases of @xmath71 and @xmath72 satisfying @xmath73    moreover recall that it is @xmath74      let @xmath76 with @xmath77 and @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 . for the applications we have in mind we will say that @xmath81 and @xmath82 are physically equivalent .",
