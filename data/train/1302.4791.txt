    "according to band theory , the resistivity of an insulator rises exponentially with decreasing temperature because thermally activated carriers are being frozen out .",
    "the resistivity of a metal , in contrast , falls with decreasing temperature , because the density of carriers is fixed while thermally excited scattering is frozen out",
    ". however there are exceptions  ` non - metallic metals '  where the resistivity rises at low temperature as the temperature falls , but without a gap opening in the electronic excitation spectrum .",
    "some of these exceptions are well understood , for example kondo systems or disordered metals showing weak or strong localization according to whether they have high or low carrier densities .",
    "there are also exceptions that are not understood , such as the underdoped cuprates @xcite , and some disordered heavy fermion compounds @xcite .",
    "these systems may have high carrier density yet display strongly non - metallic resistivity as the temperature is varied between room temperature and @xmath3 k. moreover , in the @xmath3 k limit the non - metallic heavy fermion systems show non - fermi - liquid properties in their resistivity , linear specific heat coefficient , and magnetic susceptibility @xcite : @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "recently , the high temperature resistivity of some iron - pnictides has also been found to be flat , or slowly rising , with decreasing temperature , even in undoped parent compounds where disorder levels are low @xcite . in these systems , however , the resistivity generally begins to fall , and becomes metallic , when magnetic order sets in , typically around 100 k to 200 k. it has been suggested that many - body effects , arising from orbital degeneracy @xcite or spin - fluctuations @xcite , may be responsible for the anomalous temperature dependence of their high - temperature resistivity",
    ".     rises monotonically with decreasing temperature , while the rise in @xmath7 is interrupted by a peak at the nel temperature @xmath0 k. as @xmath3 k the resistivity has a negative slope with a sub - linear , non - fermi - liquid power law .",
    "the inset shows that , in contrast , the specific heat is fermi - liquid - like at low temperature .",
    "the data are from reference @xcite .",
    ", width=377 ]    we recently showed that the hexagonal iron - pnictide , fecras , is an extreme example of such behaviour @xcite : over four decades of temperature from above 800 k to below 80 mk , single crystals show a resistivity in the hexagonal plane that rises monotonically with decreasing temperature , but without showing the presence of a gap ( see figure [ fig : ambient ] ) .",
    "the @xmath8-axis resistivity is similar , except for a local maximum at a nel ordering transition near 125 k. in the limit as @xmath3 k , the resisitivity shows a non - metallic rise with a non - fermi - liquid power law dependence on temperature .",
    "in contrast , the specific heat , @xmath9 , and the ac - susceptibility , @xmath10 , obey fermi liquid power laws as @xmath11 k. this combination of non - fermi - liquid transport with fermi - liquid thermodynamic properties is very unusual .",
    "moreover , the linear coefficient of specific heat is large , @xmath12 mj/(molek@xmath13 ) , as is the pauli susceptibility , showing that fecras has a large density of states at the fermi energy .",
    "if the carrier density were small , as in some non - metallic metals , this value of @xmath14 would require extremely massive quasiparticles , which would itself be unusual for a @xmath15-electron system .",
    "band structure calculations , however , predict a large carrier density @xcite , with three large , three - dimensional fermi surfaces @xcite . according to neutron diffraction measurements , levels of disorder in our single crystals are low @xcite .",
    "the physics behind the non - metallic resistivity of fecras is not known .",
    "its general behaviour is somewhat reminiscent of systems that are on the border of anderson localization , in which the fermi energy is close to the mobility edge separating extended from localized states in disordered semiconductors @xcite .",
    "such materials can show a non - metallic resistivity combined at low temperature with a linear @xmath9 , however the carrier density in fecras seems much too high , and the level of disorder much too low , for it to be in this regime .",
    "thus , for example , in well - known cases with a non - metallic resistivity such as phosphorus - doped silicon or non - stoichiometric ce@xmath16s@xmath17 @xcite the resistivity on the border of anderson localization is over 100 times larger than we see in fecras , while in si : p which has a linear specific heat at low temperature , @xmath14 is 300 times smaller than we see in fecras @xcite .",
    "an obstacle to understanding the physics of fecras is the antiferromagnetic transition near 125 k. as samples are cooled through this transition , the @xmath8-axis resistivity falls abruptly in the highest quality crystals , before continuing to rise again at lower temperature , as shown in figure [ fig : ambient ] .",
    "this behaviour suggests that there is some spin - fluctuation scattering , but it might also be compatible with an orbital mechanism .",
    "the @xmath18-plane resistivity does not fall upon cooling below @xmath2 , indeed if anything the slope of @xmath19 is steepest just below @xmath2 ( see figure [ fig : ambient ] ) , producing a weak ` bump ' , or concave downwards region , below @xmath2 .",
    "it would be interesting to know the low temperature limiting behaviour of the resistivity in the absence of antiferromagnetic order .",
    "a possible scenario is that the resistivity would saturate , or even begin to fall , as @xmath3 k in the absence of magnetic order that opens a spin - density - wave gap over part or all of the fermi surface . or , at the other extreme ,",
    "perhaps a full gap would open over the entire fermi surface , leading to diverging resistivity as @xmath3 k , but antiferromagnetism prevents the opening of this gap and leaves a semi - metallic state with a small fermi surface .",
    "the antiferromagnetic order in fecras is itself unusual , and indicative of some level of frustration due to the p@xmath202 m crystal structure , which can be viewed as a triangular lattice of iron ` trimers ' , plus a distorted kagome sublattice of cr ions .",
    "magnetic order is found only on the cr sublattice , in the form of a commensurate spin - density wave that triples the unit cell in the hexagonal plane , while along the @xmath8-axis the moments are parallel @xcite .",
    "the nel temperature is low compared with the comparable tetragonal systems fe@xmath21as and cr@xmath21as , which have @xmath22 k @xcite and @xmath23 k @xcite respectively . in fecras ,",
    "the iron site is tetrahedrally coordinated by as , as in the iron - pnictide superconductors , and even below the antiferromagetic transition it does not display a measurable magnetic moment in neutron scattering or mssbauer spectroscopy .",
    "this is in agreement with band - structure calculations @xcite that found that the partial density of states on the iron sites is too low to meet the stoner criterion for magnetic moment formation , and indeed in a recent paper the iron k@xmath24 x - ray emission spectrum from fecras was used to provide a non - magnetic reference @xcite .",
    "it should be noted , however , that in the related tetrahedral compound fe@xmath21as the iron moment on the tetrahedrally coordinated site is 1.28 @xmath25 @xcite , suggesting that this site is close to the magnetic / non - magnetic moment - formation boundary , and that frustration may also play a role in moment suppression on the iron site .",
    "the physics of frustrated metallic magnets still has many open questions @xcite .",
    "based on the frustrated magnetic sublattices and the absence of a magnetic moment on the iron sites , rau et al .",
    "have put forward a theory that the anomalous behaviour of fecras arises from a ` hidden spin liquid ' on the iron sublattice @xcite . in this picture , the conduction electrons fractionalize , and anomalous transport is due to scattering of bosonic charge degrees of freedom off of strong gauge fluctuations .    in this paper",
    "we try to determine whether the antiferromagnetism is playing an important role , particularly in the @xmath11 k limit , by using pressure to adjust @xmath2 .",
    "we find that , despite suppressing @xmath2 by more than a factor of two , and possibly all the way to 0 k in our highest pressure measurements , the general behaviour of the anomalous resistivity is not dramatically modified , suggesting that the opening of a spin - density - wave gap does not play an important role in the non - metallic resistivity of fecras .",
    "we have carried out four - terminal resistivity measurements on single crystal samples of fecras at high pressure .",
    "crystals were grown from a stoichiometric melt in an alumina crucible within a sealed quartz tube .",
    "the material was melted twice , and then annealed at 900@xmath26c for 150 hours .",
    "sample quality in fecras is revealed by the sharpness of the resistive transition at @xmath2 , the value of @xmath2 , and the temperature at which glassy behaviour in the magnetic susceptibility sets in .",
    "the crystals used in these measurements were from our highest quality batch @xcite , in which @xmath0 k in susceptibility measurements , @xmath27 k according to the cusp in the @xmath8-axis resistivity , and in which glassy behaviour is very weak and only sets in below 10 k. details of crystal growth and characterization can be found in reference @xcite .",
    "electrical contacts to the samples were made with dupont 6838 epoxy .",
    "these had high resistivities at ambient pressure , but under pressure they fell to the range of a few ohms .",
    "we pressurized two single crystals , one with @xmath28 which measures @xmath7 , and the other with @xmath29 , measuring @xmath30 .",
    "the @xmath7 sample had dimensions @xmath31 .",
    "it was pressurized in a moissanite anvil cell with 800 @xmath32 m culets .",
    "the gasket was beryllium - copper , with a 400 @xmath32 m hole , insulated with a mixture of alumina - powder and stycast 1266 epoxy .",
    "the @xmath30 sample had dimensions @xmath33 and was pressurized in a diamond anvil cell with 600 @xmath32 m culets , using a fully hardened t301 stainless - steel gasket .",
    "daphne oil 7373 was used at the pressure medium .",
    "the pressure was determined at room temperature using ruby fluorescence ; the pressure may shift by up to @xmath34 gpa while the cell is cooled .",
    "the @xmath7 sample survived up to 10 gpa before an anvil broke , while the @xmath30 sample survived up to 17 gpa .    in order to track the pressure dependence of @xmath2 we made use of the peak in @xmath7 at @xmath2 .",
    "unfortunately , @xmath30 does not have a well - defined anomaly at @xmath2 , as can be seen in figure [ fig : ambient ] , so we could only follow @xmath2 vs.  pressure with confidence up to 10 gpa .",
    "a possible concern with all high pressure measurements is pressure - induced structural phase transitions . among the 111 pnictides however",
    ", fecras should be relatively immune to such transitions .",
    "the 111 pnictides come in three main crystal structures : tetrahedral , hexagonal and orthorhombic , in order of decreasing unit cell volume @xcite .",
    "both fe@xmath21as and cr@xmath21as have the tetrahedral structure , and there is only a narrow range of stability of the hexagonal phase around the fecras stoichiometry , thus fecras must be just barely below the volume criterion of stability for the hexagonal phase .",
    "we thus expect it to be able to withstand quite a lot of compression before it transforms to the orthorhombic phase , and indeed in our measurements we did not see any abrupt changes in resistivity that would indicate a change of structure .",
    "resistivity measurements were carried out at many pressures , as shown in figures [ fig : rhocvsp ] and [ fig : rhoabvsp ] . at each pressure",

    "the main features of this plot are : 1 ) although the curves shift downwards with increasing pressure , showing that the sample becomes more conducting with increasing pressure , the overall effect is small ; 2 ) @xmath2 is suppressed by pressure , as shown by the shift to lower temperature of the peak in @xmath7 , which is known from our previous measurements to coincide with @xmath2 @xcite ; and 3 ) the overall shape of @xmath7 vs.  @xmath37 does not change markedly .",

    "the resistivity remains non - metallic with little change in slope .",
    "the @xmath3 k slope is also roughly independent of pressure , remaining non - fermi - liquid like at all pressures , with the same power law behaviour within the error , @xmath39 , as was observed at ambient pressure .    in figure",

    "nevertheless , it is clear from figure 3 that @xmath2 falls roughly linearly with pressure .",
    "fitting a straight line to the points in figure 3 gives @xmath41 k / gpa .",
    "if we extrapolate this linear behaviour to estimate the pressure at which the quantum critical point , @xmath42  k , would be reached , then we find @xmath43 gpa .",
    "it should be noted , however , that such extrapolations are not always reliable : @xmath2 vs.  @xmath40 curves can turn downwards @xcite or saturate @xcite , so that @xmath44 may be significantly smaller or larger than this value .",
    "the inset of figure [ fig : tnvsp ] shows that the high temperature slope of @xmath7 vs.  @xmath37 is unaffected by pressure , within the error , emphasizing that pressure has little effect on the non - metallic resistivity at @xmath38 .    ,",

    "unfortunately , @xmath30 does not have a sharp feature at @xmath2 ( see figure [ fig : ambient ] ) , so we can not continue our @xmath2 vs.  @xmath40 curve using this data . as with @xmath7 , @xmath30 decreases with increasing pressure , the overall effect is small , and the non - metallic temperature dependence is relatively unaffected by pressure up to 17.3 gpa .",
    "the high - temperature slope , shown in the inset , is unchanged within the error .",
    "the @xmath3 k non - metallic behaviour of @xmath30 vs.  @xmath37 also persists to high pressure , however the slope is smaller in the two highest - pressure curves , and the unusual sub - linear temperature dependence crosses over to become more linear in @xmath37 . at intermediate temperatures the concave region , seen at ambient pressure below @xmath2 , seems to have been suppressed in these highest pressure curves .",
    "this would be consistent with the extrapolation of @xmath2 in figure [ fig : tnvsp ] , so antiferromagnetism may indeed have been suppressed by 17.3 gpa . as a result of the suppression of this",
    "concave downwards section , @xmath30 at 17.3 gpa looks quasilinear over the whole temperature range .",
    "we have seen no indication of superconductivity in any of our data .",
    "in these measurements we have suppressed @xmath2 by at least a factor of two , and if the extrapolation of @xmath2 vs.  @xmath40 beyond 10 gpa can be trusted , then in our measurements up to 17.3 gpa on the @xmath30 sample @xmath2 may have been suppressed to 0 k. despite this suppression of antiferromagnetic order , the overall shape of the resistivity curves is not dramatically affected : the high temperature resistivity remains non - metallic with minimal change of its large , negative slope , while the @xmath3 k resistivity also remains non - metallic , with non - fermi - liquid power laws persisting to all but the two highest pressures , and with remarkably little change of slope . the most notable changes that we do observe are the gradual disappearance of the concave downward regions in @xmath47 vs.  @xmath37 that are associated with antiferromagnetic order , and an indication in the @xmath30 sample that for @xmath48 gpa the @xmath3 k resistivity crosses over from sublinear to linear dependence on @xmath37 .",
    "this latter change may have to do with the antiferromagnetic quantum critical point being approached .",
    "linear resistivities are typical of antiferromagnetic quantum critical points , although in all of the cases that we know of , the slope of @xmath47 vs.  @xmath37 is positive , not negative as in fecras .     sample as a function of temperature , from 300 to 2 k. the low temperature data ( @xmath35k ) fit to a sub - linear power law with nearly the same exponent ( @xmath36 ) for the two lowest - pressure curves , but become nearly linear at 13.7 and 17.3 gpa .",
    "the inset shows the pressure dependence of the @xmath38 slope @xmath46 as a function of pressure , obtained by fitting a line to the data between 150 and 300 k. no significant pressure dependence is observed .",
    ", width=377 ]    there are few materials to which we can compare these results .",
    "the robustness of the non - metallic resistivity of fecras under pressure is in sharp contrast to that of cecuas@xmath21 @xcite , whose strongly non - metallic resistivity between room temperature and 1.8 k is completely suppressed at 10 gpa to produce a metallic resistivity over the entire temperature range .",
    "lafeaso is the iron - pnictide superconductor whose resistivity most closely resembles fecras : for @xmath49 k its ambient - pressure resistivity is nearly flat , although unlike fecras its resistivity becomes metallic for @xmath50 k. as pressure is increased up to 12 gpa , the magnitude of the high - temperature resistivity falls , but the non - metallic slope remains flat @xcite .",
    "thus , the behaviour is like fecras in that the resistivity vs.  temperature curves are displaced downwards by pressure but their slope is not changed .",
    "another 1111 pnictide , cafeaso , has a quasi - linear , weakly metallic , slope at high temperature , and again this slope is nearly independent of pressure while the resistivity curves displace downwards @xcite .",
    "the 122 pnictides are even more metallic at high temperature , and in these systems pressure increases the metallic slope somewhat , so pressure makes these materials more metallic , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "one major difference between fecras and all of these systems however is that pressure suppresses the total resistivity much more slowly in fecras .",
    "for example , in lafeaso @xcite , the non - metallic resistivity at room temperature falls by 55% between 0 and 12 gpa  from from @xmath51 to @xmath52 m@xmath53 cm  while in fecras @xmath30 at room temperature falls by only 10% between 4 and 17 gpa  from @xmath54 to @xmath55 @xmath56 cm .",
    "while our results rule out magnetic long - range order as an important factor in the non - metallic resistivity of fecras at low temperature , they do not necessarily exclude spin - fluctuations as playing a role .",
    "the iron - pnictides superconductors are believed to be incipient mott insulators . in a theoretical study based on this picture , dai et al .  decomposed the electronic excitations into a coherent part near the fermi energy and an incoherent part further away @xcite .",
    "the latter comprises incipient lower and upper hubbard bands , which accommodate localized fe moments .",
    "this model supports a magnetic quantum critical point as a result of the competition between magnetic ordering of the local moments and the mixing of the local moments with the coherent electrons . the spectral weight of the coherent quasiparticle peak changes as a result of mixing and once it exceeds a critical value , magnetism disappears . in analogy with this model , the non - metallic behaviour of fecras could be a manifestation of incipient mott insulating behaviour .    however , there are good reasons for thinking that the physics of fecras may be different . in fecras ,",
    "local moments reside on the cr and not the fe sites , so the incoherent carriers would have to be released from cr @xmath57-orbitals while the coherent part of the spectrum most likely would stem from fe @xmath57-orbitals hybridized with as @xmath58-orbitals .",
    "non - fermi - liquid behaviour could then arise due to a coupling between the two species of carriers . within this theoretical framework",
    ", we naively expect that , because pressure increases the mixing between the coherent and incoherent parts of the spectrum , at some critical pressure the magnetic order must vanish .",
    "this model has not been worked out for fecras , and as far as we know it would not explain the fermi liquid specific heat and magnetic susceptibility that are seen at ambient pressure .",
    "morever , it is far from clear that fecras is close to a mott transition .",
    "as noted in the introduction , band - structure calculations predict three large fermi surfaces , and would seem to place the system far from a mott state .",
    "alternative models , for example involving orbital effects @xcite , a hidden spin liquid @xcite , microscopic phase - separation @xcite , or even some exotic form of kondo effect may more accurately capture the physics .",
    "it would be of interest to carry out optical conductivity and nmr measurements to see if a pseudogap is forming as the resistivity rises with decreasing temperature , and to investigate the spin dynamics . in terms of possible spin - liquid states",
    "@xcite , thermal conductivity measurements at low temperature may be enlightening .",
    "we have found that suppression of antiferromagnetic long - range order does nt strongly affect the non - metallic resistivity seen across several decades of temperature in fecras , while the the non - fermi - liquid power law behaviour of the resistivity as @xmath3 k , at most crosses over from sublinear below 10 gpa , to linear above 10 gpa .",
    "these results rule out the formation of spin - density - wave gaps on the fermi surface as playing an important role in the anomalous non - metallic resistivity of this material .",
