    "the concept of a polaron as a charge carrier bound to a self - created lattice distortion ( polarisation ) as a result of electron - phonon ( ep ) interaction has been introduced long ago by landau @xcite . in recent decades , experimental work on a variety of materials has revealed the existence of such quasiparticles in many cases .",
    "of particular interest in this context are colossal - magnetoresistive manganites , in which there is ample experimental evidence for the polaronic character of the charge carriers @xcite .",
    "more recently , a lot of work on polaron physics has been driven by technological realization of nanostructures such as quantum wells or dots , in which the confinement of carriers usually enhances lattice effects ( see @xcite and references therein ) .    until recently ,",
    "the bulk of theoretical work on polaronic systems was concerned with the zero - density case ( one or two electrons ) for which , within the framework of the one - dimensional ( 1d ) holstein model considered here , it is now well understood that a crossover takes place from a large polaron ( extending over more than one lattice site ) to a small polaron ( with the lattice distortion essentially being localised to the same lattice site as occupied by the electron ) upon increasing the ep interaction strength @xcite ( for a review of spectral properties see @xcite ) .",
    "the critical coupling for the crossover sensitively depends on the ratio of the phonon frequency and the electronic hopping integral . despite a noticeable increase in",
    "effective mass in the strong - coupling regime , in a strict sense , polarons remain itinerant quasiparticles at zero temperature .",
    "quantum phonon fluctuations  not to be neglected in any reliable calculation  strongly affect the transport properties , especially in low - dimensional systems .",
    "although a detailed understanding of the process of polaron formation in the low - density limit was a necessary first step , real materials are usually characterised by finite charge - carrier densities , so that residual interaction between individual polarons ( due to overlap of the phonon clouds ) becomes important . for parameters",
    "relevant to experiment , a rigorous treatment of density effects @xcite gives rise to interesting new results  @xcite , substantially different from those for a gas of weakly or non - interacting polarons realised , e.g. , in the non - adiabatic regime .",
    "these discrepancies may also hint at an explanation of the difficulties and inconsistencies arising when fitting experimental data on , e.g. , the manganites by using results valid for independent polarons or weak coupling @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we review and extend recent results on the so - called many - polaron problem in the framework of the 1d spinless holstein model . to this end , we report on numerical data from exact diagonalisation , cluster perturbation theory and the density - matrix renormalisation group , as well as analytical self - energy calculations , to study photoemission and phonon spectra , optical conductivity as well as static correlation functions .",
    "the numerical methods fully take into account quantum phonon effects , and are capable of describing the most important regime of intermediate ep coupling at finite charge - carrier densities .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "the model is introduced in section  [ sec : model ] , and a quick overview of the methods employed and a definition of observables is given in section  [ sec : methods ] .",
    "section  [ sec : results ] is devoted to a discussion of previous and new results on the density dependence of the physics .",
    "finally , we conclude in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "as we shall see in section  [ sec : results ] , the density dependence of , in particular , the photoemission spectra is quite complicated .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to begin with a simple yet physically reasonable model for a many - polaron system . in this way , the density effects may be understood without additional complications due to , for example , mott - hubbard physics occurring in the spinful case @xcite .",
    "hence we shall consider the hamiltonian @xmath0 here @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) creates ( annihilates ) a spinless fermion at lattice site @xmath3 , @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) creates ( annihilates ) a phonon at site @xmath3 , and @xmath6 .",
    "the first term of hamiltonian  ( [ eq : model : h ] ) describes the hopping of spinless fermions between neighbouring sites @xmath7 on a 1d lattice .",
    "the lattice constant is taken to be unity .",
    "the second term accounts for the elastic and kinetic energy of the lattice ( @xmath8 ) and , finally , the last term constitutes a local coupling of the lattice displacement to the fermion occupation number which can be zero or one .",
    "the model parameters are the hopping integral @xmath9 , the phonon frequency @xmath10 , and the coupling constant @xmath11 .",
    "the relation of the atomic - limit polaron binding energy to the latter reads @xmath12 . introducing the dimensionless quantities @xmath13 and @xmath14",
    "we are left with two independent parameter ratios .",
    "in order to achieve a thorough understanding of the carrier - density dependence of the holstein model , it is beneficial to make use of both numerical and analytical methods . whereas large - scale numerical simulations yield exact results for finite systems , approximate analytical calculations yield additional insight into the problem .",
    "the methods to be used here have been described in detail elsewhere @xcite .      in this paper",
    "we use exact diagonalisation ( ed ) in combination with cluster perturbation theory ( cpt ) @xcite and the kernel polynomial method ( kpm ) @xcite , as well as the density - matrix renormalisation group ( dmrg ) ( for adaption of these techniques to coupled ep systems see  @xcite and references therein ) . in all cases",
    "we employ parallel codes to obtain reliable results for the complex many - body problem under consideration .",
    "furthermore , for most calculations , the homogeneous @xmath15 lattice distortion has been treated separately to reduce the phonon hilbert space @xcite .",
    "all results of this work are for zero temperature .",
    "note that we have in the past also applied a ( finite - temperature ) quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) algorithm to the present problem  @xcite .",
    "although the results are consistent with the findings from other approaches , it turns out that the subtle details of the crossover are difficult to see in the calculated single - particle spectra due to temperature effects and the use of the maximum entropy method .",
    "the main observable of interest here is the one - particle spectral function , which provides us with valuable information about the character of the quasiparticles in the system , as well as about the existence of excitation gaps , etc .",
    "the transition amplitude for removing ( @xmath16 ) ( adding ( @xmath17 ) ) a free electron  corresponding to ( inverse ) photoemission  is determined by the imaginary part of the retarded one - particle green function @xmath18 and hence by the wavevector - resolved spectral function @xmath19 here @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 denotes the ground state of hamiltonian  ( [ eq : model : h ] ) .",
    "the spectral functions  ( [ eq : akw ] ) can be calculated exactly on small clusters with @xmath23 lattice sites ( and hence for a finite number of wavevectors ) with periodic boundary conditions using the kpm .",
    "alternatively , using cpt , we may calculate the real - space cluster green function @xmath24 of a @xmath25-site cluster with open boundary conditions for all non - equivalent combinations of @xmath26 , from which an approximation for the spectrum of the infinite lattice can be obtained by treating the inter - cluster hopping in first - order strong - coupling perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "then the partial densities of states ( doss ) are obtained from @xmath27 the phonon spectral function @xmath28 is calculated by using a cluster approximation @xcite for the phonon green function @xmath29 with the phonon coordinates @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 .",
    "we shall also present kpm results for the linear optical response @xmath33 to a longitudinal electric field , with the regular part @xmath34    \\,.\\ ] ] here @xmath35 is the energy of the @xmath36-th eigenstate @xmath37 of the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : model : h ] ) defined on an @xmath23-site lattice with periodic boundary conditions , and the current operator @xmath38 .",
    "finally , we consider the fermion - boson and fermion - fermion correlation functions @xmath39 and @xmath40 respectively . here",
    "@xmath41 , and we have introduced the notation @xmath42 for the carrier density , where @xmath43 denotes the number of fermions in the ground state .      on the analytical side , we shall present recent results from second - order self - energy calculations valid in the weak- and strong - coupling regime , respectively @xcite .",
    "this approach allows us to calculate the coherent ( `` c '' , infinite lifetime ) and incoherent ( `` ic '' , finite lifetime ) contributions to the one - particle ( polaron ) spectral function given by @xcite @xmath44 where all energies are measured relative to the fermi energy @xmath45 .",
    "from previous work @xcite ( see also references in @xcite ) , the basic effects of variations of the carrier density in the framework of the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : model : h ] ) are known .",
    "it turns out that the physics is particularly simple in the non - adiabatic regime @xmath46 , where the quasiparticles are small polarons at all densities at intermediate ( @xmath47 ) and strong ( @xmath48 ) ep coupling  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , in the experimentally often realised adiabatic regime @xmath49 , recent studies have revealed important new effects to be discussed in detail below .",
    "apart from providing a unified discussion of previous work , we present new results to extend the present knowledge about the 1d spinless holstein model .",
    "we shall begin with the limiting cases of weak and strong ep coupling , respectively , for which the calculated spectral functions are rather simple .",
    "due to the shortcomings of the qmc method used previously , we apply ed and cpt with significantly better energy resolution . following previous work",
    ", we set @xmath50 .    the one - electron ground state of the holstein model is a ( weakly - dressed electron ) large polaron at ( very ) weak ep coupling , and a small polaron at strong coupling . for @xmath51 ,",

    "it is known from the spinful holstein model that real - space pairing of electrons into bipolarons can occur if the ep - mediated attraction overcomes the kinetic and coulomb energy .",
    "hence , one might expect aggregation of polarons in one region of the system , i.e. , a clustering of polarons ( polaron droplets ) or bipolarons .",
    "phase separation might also appear when doping the system away from the half - filled ( charge - ordered ) band case .    to approve or rule out this possibility ,",
    "we calculate the ground - state energy as a function of carrier density using the dmrg .",
    "the latter approach permits us to consider a large cluster with @xmath101the number of fermions @xmath119so that we can increment @xmath66 in rather small steps .",
    "any tendency toward phase separation should manifest itself by non - convex behaviour of @xmath120 as a function of @xmath66 .",
    "the results , presented in figure  [ fig : dmrg_energy ] , provide strong evidence for the absence of phase separation in the model considered here . as a consequence of the very small binding energy in the model with two electrons @xcite , the tendency towards pairing",
    "is also suppressed as compared to the spinful case .",

    "using a variety of different and in many aspects complementary methods , we have obtained a rather complete understanding of the many - polaron problem in the framework of the one - dimensional spinless holstein model . whereas the physics is simple in the limiting cases of weak or strong electron - phonon interaction , or in the non - adiabatic regime  the charge carriers being either weakly renormalised electrons or small polarons ",
    "substantial density effects are observed in the ( adiabatic ) intermediate - coupling case .",
    "starting from low densities @xmath121 ( the single - polaron problem ) , the nature of the charge carriers changes from large polarons to renormalised electrons , resulting in a metallic system at intermediate carrier densities @xmath122 .",
    "this crossover has been investigated by studying photoemission spectra , phonon spectra , optical response , fermion - lattice and fermion - fermion correlation functions .",
    "all these observables support the hypothesis of dissociation of large polarons in a conclusive way .    furthermore , by calculating the ground - state energy as a function of @xmath66 up to @xmath115 , we can strongly argue against phase separation of polarons .",
    "interestingly , the results point toward the occurrence of lattice instabilities accompanied by charge ordering at commensurate fillings other than 0.5 , but this issue needs further investigation .",
    "the present work is restricted to a rather simple model .",
    "however , the density effects on the nature of the charge carriers arise from the residual interaction ( overlap ) of extended polarons . such a basic mechanism may be expected to be important also in more involved models ( e.g. , with long - range interactions and spin , or in higher dimensions ",
    "large polarons exist in frhlich models also for @xmath123 ) .",
    "there is also no reason to expect the absence of similar physics in dense polaronic systems such as the manganites , especially as recent experimental work points towards the existence of large polarons in these materials @xcite .",
    "the relevance of the effects discussed in this work to realistic materials is further substantiated by the fact that intermediate densities , small but finite phonon frequencies and intermediate couplings are widely regarded as the experimentally most relevant parameter region .    finally , since existing weak - coupling or low - density theories on the same or similar models",
    "do not exhibit the crossover considered here due to the neglect ( or insufficient treatment ) of density effects , future work on more general many - polaron systems is highly desirable . despite the greater complexity",
    ", it would be important to take into account the spin degrees of freedom , as well as a finite coulomb repulsion between charge carriers .",
    "the rapid increase in computer power opens up the perspective of such studies in the near future .",
