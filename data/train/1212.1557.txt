    "the possibility of obtaining the heaviest superheavy elements @xmath9119 and @xmath10120 by using the @xmath0ca beam in the @xmath0ca+@xmath11es and @xmath0ca+@xmath12fm reactions , respectively is restricted by difficulties in obtaining a thick enough of @xmath11es and @xmath12fm actinide targets because the other es and fm isotopes are radioactive with shorter lifetimes . therefore , in order to reach heavier superheavy elements ( she ) , the beams heavier than @xmath0ca ( as for example @xmath13ti , @xmath14cr , @xmath15fe , @xmath16ni , and other heavier projectiles ) against the above - mentioned actinide targets should be used .",
    "but , unfortunately , the evaporation residue ( er ) cross sections decreases strongly by decreasing the charge ( mass ) asymmetry of reactants in the entrance channel .",
    "this is connected with the strong hindrance to formation of compound nucleus due to the dominant role of the quasifission process which competes with complete fusion .",
    "quasifission is the decay of the formed dinuclear system ( dns ) into two fissionlike fragments after the charge and/or mass exchange between its components without reaching the compound nucleus stage .",
    "the capture events that survive quasifission populate the complete fusion formation from which the deformed mononucleus may reach the statistically equilibrated shape of compound nucleus ( cn ) .",
    "another hindrance to formation of compound nucleus appears in collisions with large impact parameter - orbital angular momentum . although dns can survive against quasifission at large values of angular momentum @xmath17 and it should be transformed into complete fusion , the mononucleus still not statically equilibrated can split into two fragments ( fast fission process ) if the fission barrier of this nuclear system disappears for high values of @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) . therefore , the fast fission process is present in reactions only at high angular momentum values ( @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is a characteristic value for each nucleus ) , while the quasifission process takes place at all @xmath18 values contributing to the capture reaction",
    ".    the first experiment which were performed at flerov laboratory of nuclear reaction of joint institute for nuclear reaction ( @xmath15fe+@xmath22pu @xcite ) and at gsi of darmstadt ( @xmath16ni+@xmath23u and @xmath14cr+@xmath24 cm @xcite , and @xmath13ti+@xmath6cf @xcite ) to explore the synthesis of the @xmath25=120 superheavy element did not identify any event of synthesis of the expected superheavy element . in our previous papers ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) , we presented results of calculation on the above - mentioned reactions which could lead to the @xmath25=120 superheavy element , but we found values of the evaporation residue cross sections lower than 0.1 pb . predictions of other authors are approximately near this value @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to improve the experimental conditions in order to be able to reach measurements of cross sections of the order of fb .",
    "the dominant role of the quasifission process in reactions with massive nuclei is connected by the increase of the intrinsic fusion barrier depending on the shell structure of interacting nuclei and rotational energy of dns which is formed at the given beam energy and orbital angular momentum in the entrance channel . moreover , due to the fast fission process taking place at high orbital angular momentum values of the complete fusion system and the nearly fusion - fission process of excited and rotating compound nucleus , the possibility to synthesize in future superheavy elements with @xmath26 by very massive nuclei reactions appears a very difficult task .",
    "we presented and discussed our results in refs .",
    "@xcite about such perspectives",
    ".    the aim of this paper is to study four reactions induced by @xmath0ca on the @xmath2cf targets in order to analyze the effect of mass number and structure properties of nuclei in the entrance channel on the capture , quasifission , and complete fusion processes . for that we compare the capture , quasifission , and fusion cross sections for these considered reactions in order to analyze the influence of the odd or even neutrons present in target on the above - mentioned cross sections .",
    "the study and comparison of such cross sections allows us to reveal the sensitivity of the model and results on the dynamical effects of the entrance channel , while the determination and analysis of the evaporation residue cross sections for the four reactions reveal the influence of the different structure of the formed @xmath3118 superheavy compound nuclei in the @xmath0ca+@xmath2cf reactions with different neutron rich targets .",

    "@xcite .    from this analysis",
    "we can conclude that the difference between capture cross sections presented in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] is caused by difference in occupation single - particle states in different isotopes of cf .",
    "this difference quantitatively appears in the friction coefficient of the radial motion and nucleus - nucleus interaction .    in calculation of the fusion cross section we use the potential energy surface of dinuclear system which includes the binding energies of the interacting nuclei ( @xmath76 and @xmath77 ) and compound nucleus ( @xmath78 ) : @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the nucleus - nucleus interacting potential .",
    "therefore , the landscape of the potential energy surface determines competition between complete fusion and quasifission during evolution of dns @xcite . as discussed in these papers , during evolution to compound nucleus , the dinuclear system must overcome the intrinsic fusion barrier @xmath81 which is determined by its mass and charge asymmetry , as well as shell structure and orientation angles of symmetry axes of its constituents .",
    "therefore , the fusion probability of the dinuclear system into compound nucleus @xmath82 at the given excitation energy @xmath83 is calculated as a sum of fusion probabilities from different configuration with different charge asymmetries : @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the excitation energy of dns for a given value of its charge - asymmetry configuration @xmath86 and @xmath87 ; @xmath88 is the collision energy in the center - of - mass system ; @xmath89 and @xmath90 are the minimum value of the nucleus - nucleus potential well and its position on the relative distance between centers of nuclei ; @xmath91 is the change of @xmath92value by changing the dns charge asymmetry from the initial value @xmath93 ; @xmath94 and @xmath95 are the probabilities of population of the configuration @xmath96 at @xmath97 and decay from this configuration , respectively . @xmath98 and @xmath99 corresponds to the point where the driving potential reaches its maximum value @xmath100 ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    the theoretical results presented in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] show that the behaviours of the quasifission excitation functions for the reactions under discussion are similar to the corresponding capture excitation functions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , while the difference fusion excitation functions ( the formalism is shortly presented in appendix a and references therein ) calculated for these reactions is not so much as for capture excitation function : the values of the fusion excitation functions are closer ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "the reason for which the advance in capture of the @xmath0ca+@xmath55cf reactions with even isotopes of cf in comparison with the @xmath0ca+@xmath56cf reactions has been lost is explained by the opposite behaviour of the charge distribution between constituents of dns which is formed in the initial stage of the reactions .",
    "as one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] the maximum of the charge distribution in dns formed in the reactions with isotopes of cf with larger ( @xmath53=251 and 252 ) mass numbers moves to the charge symmetric direction while the charge distribution of ones formed in the reactions with isotopes of cf with smaller mass numbers ( @xmath53=249 and 250 ) moves to charge asymmetric direction .",
    "it is known from theoretical models based on the dns concept @xcite and our calculations that hindrance to complete fusion increases for the more charge symmetric configurations because in this case intrinsic fusion barrier increases and quasifission barrier decreases making system less stable against decay into two fissionlike fragments ( we call them quasifission fragments ) @xcite .",
    "therefore , although the capture excitation function of the @xmath0ca+@xmath6cf reaction was lower but its fusion excitation function grows more fastly than the ones of the other reactions by increasing the beam energy and becomes even higher ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .    the fusion probability @xmath82 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) determines fusion cross section at the given capture cross section and , therefore , its behaviour is similar of the behaviour of the fusion excitation function presented in fig .",
    "the close values of the calculated fusion cross sections of all reactions mean that the difference in the evaporation residue cross sections for the @xmath0ca+@xmath2cf reactions may appear in dependence of the survival probability of compound nucleus and excited intermediate nuclei along the de - excitation cascade of cn on its mass number @xmath101 .",
    "the excitation function of the individual evaporation residues ( er ) along the de - excitation cascade of compound nuclei formed in the investigated @xmath0ca+@xmath102cf reactions are calculated by formula ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the partial formation cross - section of the excited intermediate nucleus of the @xmath105th step and @xmath106 is the survival probability of the @xmath105th intermediate nucleus against fission along the de - excitation cascade of cn .",
    "it is clear that @xmath107 .",
    "the maximum value @xmath108 of partial waves contributing to capture events is found by solving the equations of motion ( 1)-(7 ) for the given initial values of the energy @xmath88 and orbital angular momentum @xmath109 of collision , at each value orientation angle @xmath33 of the axial symmetry of the deformed target nucleus ( in details see ref .",
    "we should stress that the real number of partial waves contributing to the er formation is much smaller than @xmath108 because @xmath106 depends on the fission barrier being a sum of the parameterized macroscopic fission barrier @xmath110 depending on the angular momentum @xmath111 and the microscopic ( shell ) correction @xmath112 @xmath113 in our calculations , superheavy isotopes of element @xmath114 have not macroscopic barrier , @xmath115 and we took into account damping of the shell correction by increasing the excitation energy @xmath116 and @xmath18 angular momentum of fissioning nucleus by the functions @xmath117 and @xmath118 , respectively . these functions are @xmath119\\}^{-1 }   \\label{hoft}\\ ] ] and @xmath120\\}^{-1 } , \\label{hofl}\\ ] ]    where , in eq .",
    "( [ hoft ] ) , @xmath121  mev is the rate of washing out the shell corrections with the temperature , and @xmath122  mev is the value at which the damping factor @xmath123 is reduced by 1/2 ; analogously , in eq . ( [ hofl ] ) , @xmath124 is the rate of washing out the shell corrections with the angular momentum , and @xmath125 is the value at which the damping factor @xmath118 is reduced by 1/2 .",
    "this procedure allows the shell corrections to become dynamical quantities , also .",
    "therefore , if the capture of @xmath0ca by an isotope of cf takes place up to values @xmath126 the fission barrier disappears at @xmath127 due to damping the shell correction by @xmath118 .",

    "[ fig12 ] .",
    "it seems to be not realistic that the 2n- and 3n- excitation functions are peaked at 35 and 36 mev of excitation energy , respectively . in the formation of evaporation residue with about 0.1 pb cross section 2",
    "emitted neutrons take away 42 mev from the @xmath136118 cn against about 13 mev requested for the neutron binding energy of 2 neutrons .",
    "it means that each neutron should move with a kinetic energy of about @xmath158 mev while in average the neutron kinetic energy is close to the cn temperature in this case which is about 0.9 mev .",
    "analogously for the 3n channel where at 0.1 pb of er cross section the 3 emitted neutrons take away 48 mev from the compound nucleus against about 19.5 mev requested for the neutron binding energy of 3 neutrons .",
    "also in this case each neutron moves with a kinetic energy of about 10 mev in comparison with the nuclear temperature of the compound nucleus that is about 1 mev .",
    "that is an unrealistic result .",
    "in fact , in our evaporation residue excitation functions reported in figs . [ fig8]-[fig14 ] , the results always lead to an average neutron kinetic energy of about 0.9 - 1 mev .    in conclusion of the present discussion",
    ", we can affirm that our complete model is able to describe the evolution of dinuclear system during reaction up to the cn formation and cn s de - excitation cascade .",
    "this model leads to reliable results of individual excitation functions of evaporation residue nuclei as a function of energy and orbital angular momentum for each projectile - target combination ( see refs .",
    "we investigated the formation of the heaviest evaporation residue nuclei from the @xmath3118 cn which are formed in reactions induced by collision of the @xmath0ca projectiles with the heaviest accessible actinide targets @xmath2cf .",
    "if in future it will be possible to prepare targets of @xmath11es and @xmath12fm , then the @xmath9119 and @xmath10120 cn s may be formed , but these targets are in every way the extreme limit of possibility of synthesizing she s by using the @xmath0ca beam because other heavier es and fm nuclei as well as other heavier actinide nuclei are radioactive with shorter lifetimes .",
    "therefore , it is impossible to prepare useful targets with the aim to synthesize superheavy elements heavier than @xmath9119 and @xmath10120 by @xmath0ca induced reactions .    by analyzing the 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 neutron emission channels along the de - excitation cascade of compound nuclei formed in the @xmath0ca+@xmath2cf reactions we studied the possibilities of synthesizing the @xmath159118 er nuclei . in addition , by considering the experimental conditions nowadays available in laboratories , the more convenient and accessible reaction channels of observing evaporation residue nuclei are the 3 and 4 neutron emission channels in the @xmath0ca+@xmath2cf reactions at beam energies corresponding to the @xmath160  mev excitation energy range of compound nuclei .    moreover , we found higher capture cross sections for the @xmath0ca+@xmath55cf reactions in comparison with the ones of the @xmath0ca+@xmath56cf reactions .",
    "we discussed the influence of the entrance channel dynamics on the capture , quasifission , and fusion cross sections by considering the mass asymmetry parameter , shell effects of reactants , dynamical deformation of nuclei in the dns formation , interaction angle between the axial symmetry axes at collision of projectile and target nuclei .",

    "@xcite regarding the observation of the @xmath4118 evaporation residue nucleus , we conclude that the better description of the experimental results is that the observed @xmath4118 synthesis events @xcite registered at two different beam energies are contributed by the the 3n - channel in the @xmath0ca+@xmath6cf reaction and 4n - channel in the @xmath0ca+@xmath138cf reaction , due to the inevitable presence of the @xmath138cf isotope in the @xmath6cf enriched target .",
    "moreover , the comparison of results obtained for the er nuclei in the investigation of the @xmath0ca+@xmath27cf reaction suggest to use one target only constituted of all the cf isotopes of more long lifetimes .",
    "it is more convenient the procedure for its preparation , and in one experiment only it is possible to observe and study a wide set of er nuclei formed by 2n , 3n , 4n , and 5n emission channels , only changing the @xmath0ca beam energy in the about @xmath161  mev range .",
