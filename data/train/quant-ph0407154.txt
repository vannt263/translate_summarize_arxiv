    "a large body of spectra of the bound levels and resonances is available in nuclear physics wherein the nuclear interaction hamiltonian is unknown . the well - known prime numbers 2,3,5,7,9,11,13,17,19 , ... do not have a representation so far .",
    "one may wonder if there is a hermitian hamiltonian that can yield them as its discrete eigenvalues .",
    "the zeta function , @xmath1 , which is real on real line as per the hypothesis of riemann ( 1859 ) has _ all _ its non - real zeros as @xmath2 ( @xmath3 being real ) [ 1 ] .",
    "the marathon and accurate computation of more than @xmath4 zeros of @xmath1 by odlyzko [ 2 ] testifies rh the best , with not even a single exception so far .",
    "first few zeta - zeros ( riemann - zeros : rzs ) are given by @xmath5 hilbert and polya have conjectured that @xmath3 could be like the eigenvalues of a hermitian hamiltonian .",
    "consequently the completeness of the spectra will lead to the proof of one of the most enigmatic and formidable problems called rh .    in nuclear spectroscopy ,",
    "the pressing need was to identify the universality that underlies the nuclear levels .",
    "the nearest neighbour level spacing distribution ( nnlds ) is the statistical distribution of the fluctuations around the mean level spacing of a collection of spectra under a class of fixed parity or other quantum numbers .",
    "random matrix theory ( rmt ) was discovered in the late 1950s to predict universalities of nnlsd in various situations . among the notable names we have wigner , landau , dyson , gaudin , mehta , porter , ginibre and pandey to associate with rmt [ 3 ] .    since the interaction hamiltonian",
    "is not known it would rather be taken as non - integrable , then there are three types of nnlsds obtained by wigner and dyson .",
    "these are given as in eq .",
    "( 4 ) ( see below ) and called as goe , gue and gse spacing - statistics [ 3 ] .",
    "most remarkably the nuclear levels with same @xmath6 are well - known to follow goe statistics .",
    "the energy levels of the chaotic sinai - billiard are known to follow the same statistics .",
    "this has supported the idea that chaos may be there in nuclear dynamics too .",
    "sinai - billiard refers to a particle in a square region with hard , reflecting edges along with a hard , reflecting circle in its center .",
    "well before the advent of rmt , hilbert had prophesied that the real part of rz are distributed as the eigenvalues of certain random hermitian matrices .",
    "in fact , in terms of rmt it means that the real parts of rzs obey nnlsd corresponding to gue .",
    "over a hundred years old , this prophecy of hilbert has been testified by odlyzko [ 2 ] as late as 1989 using more than @xmath4 rzs .",
    "montgomery in 1973 ( see in mehta [ 3 ] ) analytically derived two - point correlation function of the real parts of rzs which turned out to be the same as that of gue .",
    "dyson had already expected this and it has also been confirmed numerically by odlyzko [ 2 ] .",
    "these two remarkable affirmations have strengthened the hilbert - polya conjecture to look for a hermitian hamiltonian for the rh .",
    "last few years have witnessed an interesting phenomenon whereby the real discrete eigenvalues need not necessarily be possessed by hermitian hamiltonians .",
    "non - hermitian , pt - symmetric [ 4 ] or pseudo - hermitian [ 5,6 ] hamiltonians too can possess real discrete spectrum . in rmt ,",
    "the matrix ensembles goe , gue , gse refer to hamiltonians with tri ( time reversal invariance ) , without tri , and with tri including kramer s degeneracy respectively .",
    "recently , we have developed the gaussian - random ensembles of pseudo - hermitian matrices , that give rise to new  universalities \" of nnlsd .",
    "we have called the new ensembles as gpue [ 7,8 ] which are expected to represent the cases where parity ( p ) and time - reversal ( t ) symmetries are individually broken but preserved jointly .    in this paper",
    ", we would like to present gpue with more refinements and reorientations . in section 2 ,",
    "we briefly introduce rmt with the ensembles of wigner and dyson .",
    "we then find a natural scope to go in for new ensembles . in section 3 and 4",
    "the new ensembles are described . in section 5 ,",
    "we report two interesting dichotomies where spacing statistics are like goe and gue , despite hamiltonians being pseudo - hermitian .",
    "following one of these dichotomies , in section 6 , we speculate on the possible features of hamiltonian corresponding to rh .",
    "we present a summary of conclusions in section 6 .",
    "an eigenspectrum is ( practically ) an outcome of the diagonalization of a hamiltonian matrix .",
    "since the analysis of nnls requires at least two eigenlevels , in rmt , one begins with @xmath7 hamiltonian matrix for simplicity .",
    "the rmt takes an important note of the fact that for systems with tri , the matrix hamiltonians are real - symmetric @xmath8 ; for systems without tri , the hamiltonians are hermitian matrices @xmath9 and for systems with tri plus kramer s degeneracy , the hamiltonians are even ( at least 4 ) dimensional @xmath10 .",
    "these hamiltonian matrices are given as [ 3,9 ] : @xmath11 , ~~h^h = \\left [ \\begin { array } { cc } \\alpha   & \\gamma \\\\ \\gamma^\\ast & \\beta \\end { array } \\right ] , h^k = \\left [ \\begin { array } { cccc } \\alpha & 0 & \\gamma^\\ast & -\\delta \\\\ 0 & \\alpha & \\delta^\\ast & \\gamma\\\\ \\gamma & \\delta & \\beta & 0\\\\ -\\delta^\\ast & \\gamma^\\ast & 0 & \\beta \\\\ \\end { array } \\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 . in order to have a large collection of eigenvalue pairs",
    ", we assume the entries @xmath13 are real and drawn independently from a gaussian - random population .",
    "notice that respective eigenvalues for ( 1 ) are @xmath14 in rmt , to reemphasize , the energy eigenvalues for tri systems turn out to have the form as @xmath15 , for non - tri systems they are as @xmath16 and for tri systems with kramer s degeneracy are as @xmath17s .",
    "the level - spacings ( @xmath18 ) in various cases are @xmath19 now the question to be asked is : what is the probability distribution of the level - spacing @xmath20 , when @xmath21 are gaussian - random variables ?",
    "more importantly one wants to know whether the levels have tendency to repel or attract each other and then what the degree of repulsion / attraction is .",
    "the real - symmetric matrices have an orthogonal symmetry which corresponds to so(n ) : goe .",
    "the hermitian matrices have unitary symmetry which corresponds to su(n ) : gue .",
    "the matrices @xmath22 have symplectic symmetry corresponding to symplectic group @xmath23 : gse .",
    "these facts are used to derive wigner - dyson universalities in nnlsd as [ 3,9 ] @xmath24 here @xmath25 is a scaled spacing ( @xmath20 ) with respect to its mean value ( @xmath26 ) . for smaller values of spacing @xmath20 , notice the tendency of level repulsion as @xmath27 .",
    "the degree of repulsion is linear , quadratic and quartic respectively for goe , gue and gse .",
    "most importantly these distributions ( 4 ) turn out to be excellent approximants to @xmath28 for @xmath29 matrices [ 3,9 ] .",
    "an alternative intuitive way of looking into these nnlsd is to see that the three statistics ( 4 ) correspond to the following multidimensional integral @xmath30 and similarly others for goe and gse .",
    "+ the common feature of the eigenvalues ( 2 ) or spacings ( 3 ) lies in their absolute reality .",
    "let us ask the following questions : firstly , can there be hamiltonians possessing conditionally real eigenvalues or spacings e.g. , @xmath31 ( real iff @xmath32 ) and @xmath33 ( real iff @xmath34 ) ?",
    "secondly , what are the symmetries of such hamiltonians ?",
    "thirdly , what are new universalities of nnlsd ?",
    "such questions have led us to think of new gaussian - random ensembles of pseudo - hermitian hamiltonians [ 7,8 ] . by a gaussian ensemble",
    ", we would mean that the probability distribution of hamiltonian @xmath35 is commonly given as @xmath36",

    "when @xmath53 , the pt - symmetry is spontaneously broken .",

    "the new `` universality '' shows a distinctly different behaviour as compared to the usual ones ( see fig .",

    "consider a transformation @xmath98 which preserves the pseudo - norm as @xmath99 , where @xmath100 .",
    "in doing so @xmath98 would satisfy an interesting condition i.e , @xmath101 which is called pseudo - unitarity .",
    "( see e.g. , [ 7 ] )    a general three parameter @xmath102 matrix , @xmath98 , which is pseudo - unitary under the same metric @xmath40 ( 14 ) can be written as @xmath103 , 0 \\le \\phi,\\psi \\le 2\\pi , 0 <",
    "\\theta < \\infty.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this constitutes a lie group @xmath67 [ 12 ] with generators as @xmath104 .",
    "however , in order to construct the pseudo - hermitian matrix ( 14 ) we require only two parameters in @xmath98 .",
    "the same situation arises [ 3,9 ] in case of gue , where two out of three parameters suffice in writing the unitary matrix @xmath105 , nevertheless it requires three - parameters to have @xmath106 .",

    "( 10 ) to ( 13 ) , leads us to a new nnlsd as @xmath112 if we write as @xmath113 where @xmath114 .",
    "its linear dependence on @xmath25 is deceptive , its behaviour near small values of @xmath25 is actually curved ( short dashed line in fig .",
    "1(b ) ) lying below the curve corresponding to @xmath85 ( see solid line in fig .",
    "1(b ) ) . for @xmath115",

    "these matrices , despite being pseudo - hermitian possess absolutely real eigenvalues . by constructing one and two parameter pseudo - unitary transformation matrices and by carrying out the procedure outlined in sections , 3 and 4 ,",
    "the spacing distributions have been obtained .",
    "interestingly , for @xmath120 the wigner surmise , @xmath85 has been recovered identically [ 8 ] !",
    "even more interestingly , by defining @xmath121 , we find a new analytic expression [ 13 ] for @xmath28 that hardly differs from @xmath122 for @xmath123 from 0 to 0.5 .",
    "for other values of @xmath123 the differences between are also not considerable .    for @xmath124 ,",
    "the hamiltonian is hermitian , by changing @xmath125 it becomes non - hermitian such that the spacing distribution does not change appreciably .",
    "we may therefore take such hamiltonians and interpret them as a smooth perturbation of the hermitian hamiltonian .",
    "we feel that the display of @xmath122 by a certain class of spectra , though the underlying hamiltonian is not hermitian ( instead it is quasi - hermitian ) is a very remarkable result .",
    "recall that rzs display @xmath122 so the prospective hamiltonian is expected to be both hermitian and tri - breaking . in the light of our dichotomous result",
    ", we speculate that the hamiltonian relevant to rh could also be a pt - symmetric ( hamiltonian ) .",
    "since complex - conjugate eigenvalues are found for a pt - symmetric hamiltonian when pt - symmetry is spontaneously broken , so @xmath126 would naturally follow from a pt - symmetric hamiltonian .",
    "furthermore , the vanishing of the norm ( pt - norm ) of the eigenstates in the domain where spontaneous breaking of symmetry occurs can be seen to be directly connected to a crucial criterion proposed by alain connes [ 1 ] for a hamiltonian which could be relevant to rh .",
    "recently , we have found [ 13 ] that for rh a few hermitian hamiltonians proposed so far [ 14 ] do not even possess a discrete spectrum .",
    "the present work tries to answer the basic question as to what could be the random matrix theory of currently researched pseudo - hermitian hamiltonians . the new  universalities \" in eqs .",
    "( 13 ) and ( 17 ) as displayed in fig",
    ". 1 are distinctly different from the usual ones , resulting in weaker repulsion among the energy - levels .",
    "like the well established goe , gue and gse , here it remains to be proved that the claimed results for @xmath117 matrices would actually stay on at least as good approximants for the @xmath29 case .",
    "this is an open challenge an answer to this would actually take us from `` universalities '' to universalities .",
    "however , we feel that ` the weaker level repulsion for small spacings ' is the essence of pseudo - hermiticity . and",
    "since the pseudo - hermiticity has been re - cast in terms of more physical pt - symmetry , an observance of weaker level repulsion at small spacings would suggest an individual violation of p and t symmetries and joint invariance of pt .",
    "pt - symmetric ( pseudo - hermitian ) hamiltonian as a physical model may now be far , nevertheless signature such as weaker level repulsion would give way to such hamiltonians .",
    "two interesting dichotomies have also been presented  -   owing to one of them we have speculated that the prospective hamiltonian for the riemann hypothesis would rather be pt - symmetric ( pseudo - hermitian ) .",
    "lastly , we would like to point out that in contrast to the ginibre matrix ensembles and some more suggested by haake [ 9 ] , we consider such complex matrices ( pseudo - hermitian ) which give conditionally real eigenvalues and we define level spacing as @xmath127 and _ not as modulus of difference of two complex eigenvalues_.",
