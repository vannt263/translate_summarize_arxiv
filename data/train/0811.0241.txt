    "spatial multiplexing for the multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) systems , employing multiple transmit and receive antennas , has been recognized as an effective way to improve the spectral efficiency of the wireless link @xcite .",
    "more recently , the multiuser schemes have been investigated for the spatial multiplexing mimo systems .",
    "this paper focuses on the downlink multiuser schemes in which each user can not cooperate with the others thus suffers from the interference from them .",
    "mainly , there are two kinds of multiuser schemes .",
    "one is the precoder or the transmit beamforming , such as the dirty - paper coding ( dpc ) @xcite and the zero - forcing ( zf ) @xcite , etc . , which mitigates the multiuser interference only by processing at the transmitter .",
    "the other is the joint transmitter - receiver ( tx - rx ) design , such as the nullspace - directed svd ( nu - svd ) @xcite and the minimum total mean squared error ( tmmse ) @xcite , etc . in general , the former possesses lower complexity but more performance penalty . with the great development of signal processors , the",
    "latter gradually draws more attention .    for the joint tx - rx design , the schemes proposed in @xcite@xcite minimize mean squared error ( mmse ) , or maximize the capacity under the transmit power constraint . whereas on some occasions , such as the multimedia communication",
    ", it is required to minimize the total transmit power while guarantee the quality of service ( qos ) .",
    "@xcite@xcite investigate the beamforming and the power allocation policy when all users are subjected to a set of post - processing signal - to - interference - and - noise ratio ( post - sinr ) constrains in the uplink simo and the downlink miso .",
    "@xcite@xcite extend this work to the downlink mimo and the mimo network , however the mimo systems discussed in @xcite@xcite are assumed that there is only one substream between each pair of the transmitter and receiver .",
    "in other words , only the multiuser interference appears in the so - called diversity mimo system in @xcite@xcite . for the multiuser spatial multiplexing mimo system ,",
    "however , both the multiuser interference between individual users and self - interference between individual substreams of a user should be mitigated .",
    "for the downlink , the transmit beamforming affects the interference signature of all receivers , whereas the receive beamforming only affects that of the corresponding user .",
    "@xcite@xcite construct a dual system , called the virtual uplink , and indicate that the virtual uplink can obtain the same post - sinr as the primary downlink .",
    "moreover , the receive beamforming matrix of the virtual uplink is identical with the transmit beamforming matrix of the primary downlink .",
    "the design of the downlink , therefore , can resort to the virtual uplink .    in this paper",
    ", we extend the duality derived for mimo network in @xcite to the multiuser spatial multiplexing mimo system . according to the uplink - downlink duality",

    "furthermore , @xmath81 is the post - sinr of ms@xmath27 s @xmath10-th substream in the virtual uplink @xmath82 ( 14 ) maximizes the weighted sum power under the maximum post - sinr constraints , however , it has no physical meaning @xcite .",
    "but it can be shown that ( 14 ) is equivalent to the following optimization problem @xmath83    _ theorem 1 _ : at the optimal point , the post - sinr constraints in ( 15 ) and ( 18 ) are active . and the solutions of ( 15 ) and ( 18 ) are identical .",

    "the beamforming matrices of the virtual uplink and the primal downlink are common .    _ proof",
    "_ : let @xmath103 be the global minimum of ( 2 ) .",
    "according to _ theorem 2 _ , ( 19 ) has the solution @xmath104 .",
    "moreover , this solution is definitely the global minimum .",
    "otherwise , a better solution of ( 2 ) would be found by applying _",
    "theorem 2 _ again .",
    "so the virtual uplink and the primal downlink have the common beamforming matrices .",
    "the weight vector @xmath99 decides whether @xmath66 and @xmath105 are used to strengthen the useful signals or alleviate the interference to other users .",
    "when a user s weight turns higher , its transmit power will decrease . in this occasion , it benefits to apply the beamforming to increase the signal gain , as the interference to other users is much less important .",
    "on the other hand , once the weight gets lower , the beamformer should try to suppress interference to others @xcite .    to mitigate the adjacent cell interference",
    ", we can increase the weights of edge users in a cell , which would induce the declining of the transmit power from the bs to them . in order to hold the post - sinr under this circumstance ,",
    "obviously , the beamforming matrices would be used to boost up the signal gain .",
    "it is rather difficult to solve the joint optimization problem ( 2 ) directly .",
    "however , it is easy to obtain @xmath106 in the primal downlink , and so does @xmath107 in the virtual uplink .",
    "moreover , it is proved in the previous section that the primal downlink is equivalent to the virtual uplink , and they have the common beamforming matrices @xmath97 and @xmath101 .",

    "[ fig 3 ] , @xmath145 , @xmath144 does not hold any more . consequently",

    "the left vertical axis is corresponding to the transmit power of ms@xmath135 and the right one is to the total transmit power . obviously , as the @xmath137 is increasing , the transmit power of ms@xmath135 is decreasing while the total power is increasing , because the optimization object is to minimize the weighted sum power @xmath153 .",
