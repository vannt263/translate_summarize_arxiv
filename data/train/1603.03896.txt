    "the problem has been resolved recently @xcite with the demonstration that the classical binomial result applies everywhere , far away as well as close to the scatterer , at least for the case of a spin or flux qubit device .",

    "note that the measurement of fcs differs from the measurement of current correlators , e.g. , current noise or higher order correlators .",
