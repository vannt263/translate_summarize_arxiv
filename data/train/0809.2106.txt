    "many motivations exist for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) of particle interactions .",
    "much of the research in high - energy physics for the past decades has been driven by the principle of naturalness .",
    "this idea states that widely disparate scales in nature , such as the electroweak and planck scales , should not exist without some symmetry principle or dynamical mechanism to explain their ratio .",
    "additional motivations to believe in physics beyond the sm have recently been found .",
    "these include the experimental discovery of neutrino masses and the strong indication of tev - scale dark matter .",
    "recent study of physics beyond the sm has focused on the tev scale , both because of dark matter and because of the imminent start of the experimental program at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "significant effort has focused on brainstorming all possible scenarios that might be observable at the lhc .",
    "two possible questions to ask are the following . are there forms of new physics whose observability at the lhc has not been studied ?",
    "do current experimental data motivate certain types of tev - scale physics ?",
    "several interesting answers to the second question have recently been given .",
    "an example relevant to the discussion here is the experimental absence of flavor - changing neutral currents , which suggests that new physics should satisfy the principle of minimal flavor violation ( mfv ) .",
    "this states that the flavor structure of physics beyond the sm should be completely determined by the sm yukawa structure  @xcite .",
    "another question that arises is whether measurements at the lhc can be used to understand details of high - scale theories .",
    "both the seesaw mechanism for neutrino masses and the near unification of sm gauge couplings suggest new physics near @xmath2 gev .",
    "effort has been devoted to determine whether lhc results can indirectly probe these high energies .",
    "an interesting scenario of physics beyond the sm suggested by the above questions is the possibility of a scalar sector containing more than the single higgs doublet of the sm .",
    "one motivation for considering extended scalar sectors is purely phenomenological .",
    "additional scalars can cause large deviations in the branching fractions of the standard higgs boson , modifying experimental search strategies  @xcite .",
    "their lhc signatures have not been extensively studied .",
    "another motivation is that certain seldom studied scalar representations naturally satisfy the principle of minimal flavor violation ( mfv ) .",
    "a recent analysis showed that scalars transforming as either @xmath3 or @xmath4 under the gauge group @xmath5 can naturally have fermionic couplings proportional to the sm yukawa structure  @xcite . while the first representation is just that of the higgs doublet , the second denotes a color - octet scalar boson not found in the sm .",
    "color - octet scalars also potentially provide a window to high - scale physics .",
    "the unification of the gauge interactions is one of the main motivations for physics beyond the sm , and it occurs naturally within grand unified theories ( guts ) .",
    "recently , in the context of adjoint @xmath1  @xcite , the possibility of light color octets in agreement with the constraints coming from the unification of gauge couplings and proton decay was pointed out  @xcite .",
    "the couplings of these states may therefore probe physics at the gut scale .",
    "while observation of color - octet states at the lhc would not prove the existence of a gut in nature , it would offer the interesting possibility of correlating measurements from the lhc with future searches for proton decay .",
    "several studies regarding the discovery of color - octet scalars at the lhc have been performed  @xcite .",
    "the most promising channel appears to be pair production of either two neutral scalars or a charged pair through the partonic channel @xmath6 , where @xmath7 denotes either a neutral or charged state  @xcite .",
    "discovery of color - octet scalars of at least 1 tev and likely much higher is possible at the lhc .",
    "as the qcd couplings of the scalars to the gluon are fixed by their octet representation , this mode has the advantage of being model - independent .",
    "while this is a nice feature for discovery of the state , it does not allow the structure of the yukawa couplings to be measured .",
    "the situation is similar to the study of the top quark at the tevatron .",
    "the discovery mode @xmath8 does nt probe the underlying yukawa structure of the top quark .",
    "the measurement of @xmath9 requires the study of single top production .    in analogy with single top production , we investigate the use of single production of charged scalars through the partonic channel @xmath10 to probe the yukawa structure of the @xmath0 scalar and the connection to the relation between @xmath11 and @xmath12",
    "it is likely that the dominant decay of the scalar is through @xmath13 , leading to the production process @xmath14 .",
    "we expect the dominant background to this signal to be @xmath15 , as we discuss later in more detail .",
    "we perform an analysis indicating that the signal can be seen over background at the lhc , and identify the relevant kinematic features that make this possible",
    ". we also study neutral scalar resonance production through the partonic channel @xmath16 , which can become sizable for a large scalar yukawa coupling to the bottom quark .",
    "this channel provides another window into the yukawa sector of the color - octet scalar .",
    "we illustrate that this can also be observed over background at the lhc .",
    "we discuss how well the scalar yukawa couplings can be measured in these channels .",
    "our paper is organized as follows .",
    "we present our notation and setup , and explain how color - octet scalars provide a window to gut - scale physics , in section  [ sec : setup ] .",
    "we discuss the various production and decay mechanisms for color - octet scalars in section  [ sec : prod ] . in section  [ sec : sim ] we describe the details of our simulation procedure .",
    "we apply this analysis procedure to the study of single charged scalar production and neutral scalar production through the @xmath17 initial state in section  [ sec : analysis ] , and demonstrate how to separate signal from background in these two channels .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : conc ] .",

    "after the scalar decay , the final state is @xmath108 .",
    "we decay the top quarks fully using the ` decay ` routine of madevent , which does not preserve spin correlations .",
    "madevent allows spin correlations to be kept throughout the entire decay chain ; we have checked on a smaller sample than that used in our full analysis , that they have a negligible effect given the cuts we use .",
    "we set @xmath109 to illustrate the analysis procedure .",

    "we mimic lhc capabilities for tagging heavy flavor jets by assuming @xmath114-jets are tagged with 60% efficiency , and that other jets fake @xmath114-jets with a 3% fake rate .",
    "an alternative to the above smearing of parton - level events is to run these events through the pythia parton - shower  @xcite and pgs detector simulation  @xcite .",
    "we have tested that using this other technique of showering the parton - level events with pythia and then using pgs to reconstruct observable objects leads to qualitatively similar results as found with the procedure described above ; a slight degradation of our figure of merit @xmath110 occurs with the alternate procedure .",

    "since the final state contains two top quarks , their reconstruction becomes an important part of the analysis . with @xmath121 ,",

    "if the invariant mass of any single jet falls within the top mass window @xmath126 gev , indicating the possibility that all of the top decay products have been combined by the jet algorithm , this jet is tagged as a top quark .",

    "these scalars appear in realistic @xmath1 grand unified theories where the @xmath165 representation is used to generate fermion masses for the charged fermions .",
    "one of their couplings is defined by the difference between the down quark and charged lepton yukawa couplings . in the case of adjoint @xmath1",

    "we study observation of tev - mass scalars using the two partonic modes @xmath166 and @xmath97 .",
    "we carefully analyze whether the signal can be seen over standard model top - quark backgrounds at the lhc , and devise a set of cuts based on the kinematics of the signal that facilitate observation .",
    "as the final state contains boosted top quarks , we discuss their reconstruction in both semi - leptonic and hadronic decay modes .",
    "we find that observation of the charged scalar with @xmath167 is possible with slightly more than @xmath168 if only semi - leptonic @xmath133 modes are used , while less than @xmath169 is needed if fully hadronic top decays can be utilized .",
    "observation of the @xmath97 channel requires less than @xmath169 in both cases .",
    "we roughly estimate the effect of systematic errors on the measurement of the yukawa parameters that lead to the signal cross section , and find obtainable precisions of 1030% , depending on the size of the couplings .    in summary , probing the color - octet scalar yukawa structure through bottom - quark initiated processes at the lhc may potentially provide a window to gut - scale physics , and create an interesting synergy between collider measurements and future proton - decay searches .",
