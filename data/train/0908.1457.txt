    "network coding was introduced by ahlswede , cai , li and yeung @xcite to send multiple messages efficiently through a network .",
    "usually , the network itself is given as a weighted , directed acyclic graph with the weights denoting the capacities of the edges .",
    "a typical example is the butterfly network in figure  [ fig : classicalbutterfly ] . in this example",
    "the task is to send one bit from @xmath1 to @xmath2 and another bit from @xmath3 to @xmath4 , where each edge is a channel of unit capacity .",
    "it is obviously impossible to send two bits simultaneously by _ routing _ since the edge between @xmath5 and @xmath6 becomes a bottleneck .",
    "however , using _ coding _ at the nodes as shown in figure  [ fig : classicalbutterfly ] , it is feasible to send the two bits as desired .",
    "two fundamental observations are in order : first , copying classical information is possible . in the example of the butterfly network , this is used for the operations performed at nodes @xmath1 , @xmath3 , and @xmath6 .",
    "second , and perhaps more importantly , information can be encoded . in the example , this is used at nodes @xmath5 , @xmath2 , and @xmath4 where the xor operation ( i.e. , addition over the finite field @xmath7 ) is applied .",
    "after the seminal result @xcite , network coding has been widely studied from both theoretical and experimental points of view and many applications have been found ( we refer to refs .",

    ", all messages at one source node must be sent to each of several target nodes .",
    "ahlswede et al .",
    "@xcite showed that the upper bound on the achievable rate given by the min - cut / max - flow condition is in fact always achievable .",
    "in other words , network coding allows one to send @xmath11 messages if and only if the value of any cut between the source node and each target node is at least @xmath11 .",
    "li , yeung and cai @xcite showed that such a rate is always achievable by _ linear _ coding over a sufficiently large finite field ( in which the operation performed at each node is a linear combination over some finite field ) . furthermore , this result was improved by jaggi et al .",
    "@xcite who showed that such encoding can be constructed in polynomial time with respect to the number of nodes .",
    "this implies that deciding whether a given multicast network has a ( linear ) network coding scheme can be solved in polynomial time .",
    "this contrasts with the general network coding problem for which lehman and lehman @xcite showed that it is np - hard to decide whether there exists a linear coding solution .",
    "another important subclass of network coding problems is the _",
    "@xmath0-pair problem _ ( also called the _ multiple - unicast problem _ ) . in this",
    "setting the network has @xmath0 pairs of source / target nodes @xmath12 , and each source @xmath13 wants to send a message @xmath14 to the target @xmath15 .",
    "notice that figure  [ fig : classicalbutterfly ] can be considered as a solution of a two - pair problem .",
    "it was shown by dougherty and zeger @xcite that the solvability ( resp .",
    "linear solvability ) of any network coding problem can be reduced to the solvability ( resp .",
    "linear solvability ) of some instance of the @xmath0-pair problem . combined with the lehman - lehman result",
    ", this implies that the linear solvability of the @xmath0-pair problem is np - hard .",
    "polynomial - time constructions of linear coding for fixed @xmath0 have been investigated @xcite , but no complete answer has been obtained yet .",
    "recently , network coding has become a topic of research in quantum computation and information , giving rise to a theory of quantum network coding .",
    "the most basic setting is the following .",
    "the messages are quantum states , and the network is also quantum , i.e. , each edge corresponds to a quantum channel .",
    "the question is whether quantum messages can be sent efficiently to the target nodes through the network ( possibly using the idea of network coding ) .",
    "a very basic difficulty immediately arises as opposed to the classical case : quantum information can not be copied @xcite .",
    "hence , multicasting quantum messages is impossible without imposing any extra conditions .",
    "one approach to work around this problem has been developed by shi and soljanin @xcite , who constructed a perfect multicasting scheme over families of quantum networks under the condition that the source owns many copies of quantum states .",
    "a more natural target may be the @xmath0-pair problem since here the number of inputs matches the number of outputs .",
    "for this problem , however , there are already a number of negative results known for the above basic setting . first , hayashi  et  al .",
    "@xcite showed that sending two qubits simultaneously and _ perfectly ( i.e. , with fidelity one ) _ on the butterfly network is impossible .",
    "leung , oppenheim and winter @xcite extended this impossibility result to the case where the messages have to be sent in an asymptotically perfect way , and also to classes of networks other than the butterfly network .",
    "this means that some extra condition is needed to achieve perfect quantum network coding for the @xmath0-pair problem case as well .",
    "the extra condition considered in this paper is to allow _ free classical communication _ to assist with sending quantum messages perfectly through the network .",
    "that is , any two nodes can communicate with each other through a classical channel which can be used freely ( i.e. , at no cost ) .",
    "free classical communication as an extra resource often appears in quantum information theory , e.g. ,  entanglement distillation and dilution ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . also , from a practical viewpoint , quantum communication is a very limited resource while classical communication is much easier to implement .",
    "thus it would be desirable if the amount of quantum communication could be reduced using network coding with the help of classical communication .",
    "another extra resource that may be considered ( and rather popular in quantum information processing ) is _ entanglement _ , such as shared epr pairs .",
    "however , it has the weakness that , once used , quantum communication is needed to recreate it .",
    "therefore , allowing free classical communication arguably is a comparatively mild additional resource for perfect quantum network coding .    the first result of this paper ( theorem  [ theorem1 ] ) can be summarized as follows : if there exists a classical linear coding scheme over a ring @xmath16 for a @xmath0-pair problem given by a graph @xmath17 , then there exists a solution to the quantum @xmath0-pair problem over the same graph @xmath18 if free classical communication is allowed .",
    "the idea to obtain this result is to perform a node - by - node simulation of the coding scheme solving the classical problem .",
    "for example , suppose that , in the classical coding scheme , a node @xmath19 of @xmath18 performs the map @xmath20 where @xmath21 is some function .",
    "in the quantum case , this node will perform the quantum map @xmath22 .",
    "a basic observation is that the first two registers should be ideally `` removed '' in order to simulate properly the classical scheme .",
    "this task does not seem straightforward since the quantum state is in general a superposition of basis states , and this superposition has to be preserved so that the input state can be recovered at target nodes .",
    "our key technique shows that this can be done if free classical communication is allowed , and if the classical scheme to be simulated is linear .",
    "more precisely , these registers are `` removed '' by measuring them in the fourier basis associated with the additive group of  @xmath16 .",
    "an extra phase then appears , but it can be corrected _ locally _ at each target node as will be proved in section  [ section : main ] .",
    "this requires ( free ) classical communication . in our construction",
    "it is sufficient to send at most @xmath23 elements of @xmath16 , where @xmath24 is the maximal fan - in of nodes of @xmath18 .",
    "a classical coding scheme is called _ vector - linear _ if the operation at each node is of the form @xmath25 , where the @xmath26 s are the vectors input to the node and @xmath27 is a matrix to apply to @xmath26 .",
    "the result above can be extended to the vector - linear coding case as well ( theorem [ theorem2 ] ) .",
    "that is , if there exists a classical vector - linear coding scheme over a ring @xmath16 for a @xmath0-pair problem given by a graph @xmath18 , then there also exists a solution to the quantum @xmath0-pair problem over the same graph @xmath18 ( again if free classical communication is allowed ) .",
    "notice that there are examples of graphs over which a vector - linear solution is known but no linear coding scheme exists ( see refs .",
    "there are also examples for which even vector - linear coding is not sufficient @xcite .",
    "however , most of known networks solvable by network coding have vector - linear solutions , and hence our result is applicable quite widely ( and actually is even applicable to the examples in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "recently , the present authors studied a slightly generalized version of the @xmath0-pair problem where the pairs @xmath12 can be chosen at the end of the protocol @xcite .",
    "the strategy there worked only when there is a solution to the associated classical multicast problem , in which each source node @xmath13 has to send its input to all target nodes @xmath28 .",
    "the idea was to simulate a classical multicast coding scheme over a finite field in order to create shared cat states ( and then to convert them into epr pairs so that quantum teleportations can be performed ) .",
    "this paper gives a more direct way of realizing quantum state transmission ( without teleportations ) that is applicable whenever there is a linear solution to the classical @xmath0-pair problem , which is a much weaker condition .",
    "furthermore , we extend a core idea of the protocol of ref .",
    "@xcite , namely , the quantum simulation of a classical linear coding scheme over a finite field , to a finite ring and to the vector - linear case .",
    "there are several papers studying quantum network coding on the @xmath0-pair problem in situations different from the most basic setting ( perfect transmission of quantum states using only a quantum network of limited capacity ) .",
    "hayashi et al .",
    "@xcite and iwama et al .",
    "@xcite considered `` approximate '' transmission of qubits in the @xmath0-pair problem , and showed that transmission with fidelity larger than @xmath29 is possible for a class of networks .",
    "hayashi  @xcite showed how to achieve perfect transmission of two qubits on the butterfly network if two source nodes have prior entanglement , and if , at each edge , we can choose between sending two classical bits and sending one qubit .",
    "leung , oppenheim and winter  @xcite considered various extra resources such as free forward / backward / two - way classical communication and entanglement , and investigated the lower / upper bounds of the rate of quantum network coding for their settings .",
    "the setting of the present paper is close to their model allowing free two - way classical communication .",
    "the difference is that ref .",
    "@xcite considered asymptotically perfect transmission while this paper focuses on perfect transmission . also ,",
    "@xcite showed optimal rates for a few classes of networks while the present paper gives lower bounds for much wider classes of networks .",
    "as mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite , free classical communication essentially makes the underlying directed graph of the quantum network undirected since quantum teleportation enables one to send a quantum message to the reverse direction of a directed edge . in this context",
    ", our result gives a lower bound of the rate of quantum network coding that might not be optimal even if its corresponding classical coding is optimal in the directed graph .",
    "however , even in the classical case , network coding over an undirected graph is much less known than that over a directed one . in the multicast network ,",
    "the gap between the rates by network coding and by routing is known to be at most two  @xcite , while there is an example for which the min - cut rate bound can not be achieved by network coding @xcite .",
    "also notice that , in the @xmath0-pair problem , it is conjectured that fractional routing achieves the optimal rate for any undirected graph ( see for example ref .",
    "however , this conjecture has been proved only for very few families of networks , and remains one of the main open problems in the field of network coding .",
