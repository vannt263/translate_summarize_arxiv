    "understanding the dynamics of multistrain diseases is a key topic in population biology . a suitable model class for such diseases , which include influenza , malaria and dengue  @xcite , must take into account the possibility of interactions among the serotypes or strains .",
    "the nature of multistrain interactions strongly affects the impact of the disease on the population as well as the mechanisms for its control .",
    "one prominent example of an endemic multistrain disease is that of dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever ( dhf ) .",
    "located in africa , the americas , and southeast asia , dengue is one of several emerging tropical diseases @xcite .",
    "there is no vaccine , although clinical trials are underway in order to generate an immune response across all strains @xcite .",
    "approximately 2.5 billion people are at risk for contracting dengue @xcite , and between 50 and 100 million cases are reported each year @xcite .",
    "the dominant four dengue viruses have progressively spread geographically to virtually all tropical countries to create a global pandemic resulting in several hundred thousand hospitalizations every year @xcite . since",
    "dengue is so far reaching and endemic , it is important to understand how it fluctuates in time , so that when proper vaccines are developed , implementation may be guided by a more thorough understanding of the disease .",
    "dengue is known to exhibit as many as four coexisting serotypes ( strains ) in a region such as thailand .",
    "dengue displays a distinctive mechanism of interaction among the strains , called antibody - dependent enhancement . once a person is infected and recovers from one serotype , life - long immunity to that serotype is conferred .",
    "antibodies are developed specifically for the first challenging serotype and not the other serotypes . in the presence of a new secondary infection , low level antibodies developed from the first infection form complexes with the second challenging serotype so that the virus can enter more cells , increasing viral production @xcite .",
    "viral loads are associated with transmissibility , and it is hypothesized that individuals with secondary infection are more infectious than during their first infection .",
    "this increased transmission rate in subsequent infections is known as antibody - dependent enhancement ( ade ) . in vitro studies of dengue fever",
    "suggested that the ade phenomenon may be due to the increasing of the infection of cells bearing the igg receptor ( g - immunoglobulin )  @xcite .",
    "the impact of ade on the modeling of multistrain diseases such as dengue is quite profound @xcite . in general , the first models were of sir type , with ade included , and they showed that for sufficiently high ade , oscillations were possible . in contrast",
    ", single strain sir models only have isolated equilibria and can not show fluctuations without external seasonal drives or noise .",
    "recent work has begun to analyze in detail the effect of ade quantitatively on the dynamics @xcite , as well as the competition between serotypes @xcite .",
    "it is also still unclear if ade increases transmission of the disease or increases mortality , shortening the effective infectious period .",
    "theoretical studies suggested that the former case allows for coexistence of strains with periodic and chaotic disease outbreaks  @xcite , while in the latter the phenomenon may decrease persistence  @xcite . throughout this work",
    "we shall assume the first case to hold .",
    "in addition to ade , another type of interaction between the strains occurs .",
    "recently , cross protection , or cross immunity between serotypes , has been conjectured to play a role in the dynamics of dengue @xcite .",
    "while a primary dengue infection with a particular serotype may confer long - life immunity to that strain  @xcite , it may also confer temporary cross immunity to the other serotypes .",
    "cross immunity may act like a prophylactic to different strains and may also possess different efficacies .",
    "that is , cross immunity may be total ( i.e. , a period of cross immunity always occurs in the event of a primary infection ) , or partial ( i.e. , only a fraction of the actual infected population becomes cross immune before being susceptible again to the disease ) . in general , the length of the cross immunity period may vary depending on the disease .",
    "cross immunity may result from an immunological response to the disease .",
    "it acts to reduce the susceptibility to a secondary infection , lowering the effective probability for reinfection to happen @xcite . in the case of dengue fever ,",
    "cross immunity may last from two up to nine months @xcite , after which the antibodies have dropped to sufficiently low levels that allow infection with other strains and subsequent ade .",
    "cross immunity plays a crucial role in the co - circulation of strains @xcite and the pathogen diversity @xcite .",
    "several studies involving separately cross immunity @xcite and ade @xcite have been published in the past .",
    "the presence of both ade and cross immunity in such models has not been extensively studied , although some recent models have begun to address this interaction . as an example of such a model , ref .",
    "@xcite studied the impact of ade on the dynamics of a multistrain disease with temporary cross immunity , giving particular importance to the `` inverse ade '' hypothesis ( i.e. , reduced infectivity of secondary infections ) .",
    "@xcite considered different types of ade while allowing for lifelong partial cross immunity .",
    "@xcite showed that including both ade and temporary cross immunity is necessary to produce periodicities consistent with epidemiological data . finally , ref .",
    "@xcite included different mechanisms of cross immunity in a model with ade in order to test the impact of a period of cross protection on the incidence of secondary dengue cases .",
    "they found that including clinical cross immunity , in which a challenge with a previously unexperienced serotype results in an increase of immunity towards the challenging serotype , gives incidence patterns of secondary dengue infections that are compatible with collected data .",
    "the aim of our work is to study in detail the impact of both ade and temporary , partial cross immunity on the dynamics of the mutistrain diseases .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in section [ sec : model ] we introduce the model , in section [ sec : weakcrossimmunity ] we analyze the effect of weak cross immunity on the system , in section  [ sec : ci ] we restrict ourselves to the case of no ade to investigate the impact of strong cross immunity on the dynamics , and in section [ sec : ciade ] we include also ade and study the interplay between cross immunity and ade .",
    "section [ sec : conclusions ] concludes with a summary and discussion .",
    "the dynamical system considered in this paper is based on the sir ( susceptible - infected - recovered ) model and is a generalization of a multistrain model with ade studied previously @xcite .",
    "we write the model for an arbitrary number @xmath0 of serotypes , and we include both ade and cross immunity in the dynamics .",
    "a set of ordinary differential equations describes the rate of change of the population in each of the classes .",
    "we assume the population size to be normalized to unity , so each state represents a fraction of the total population .",
    "the quantities that enter the equations are the fraction of susceptibles to all serotypes , denoted by @xmath1 ; the primary infectives with strain @xmath2 , @xmath3 ; the cross immunes that are recovered from strain @xmath2 and have temporary cross immunity to all strains , @xmath4 ; the recovereds from strain @xmath2 that are immune to strain @xmath2 only , @xmath5 ; and the secondary infectives with strain @xmath6 previously infected with strain @xmath7 , @xmath8 .",
    "the flow of an individual through the population in the two strain case is shown in figure [ fig : flow ] .",
    "tertiary infections are not included  @xcite , so all individuals enter the completely immune class @xmath9 after recovery from a secondary infection .",

    "fig : ade_withci ]",
    "in this work we analyzed the impact of two types of strain interactions in a multistrain model for epidemics , cross immunity and ade .",
    "the ade parameter measured an increase in infectiousness of secondary infectives , and the cross immunity strength determined the reduction in susceptibility to other strains during a temporary period after recovering from primary infection with one strain .    the nature of the observed dynamics depended on the strength of the cross immunity .",
    "weak cross immunity was found to stabilize the endemic steady state .",
    "this effect was motivated analytically by studying a reduced model for weak cross immunity with symmetry between strains .",
    "although the analysis was performed for a perturbed system without mortality , both the analytical treatment and numerical simulations of the full system were in good qualitative agreement . since the onset of fluctuations",
    "is determined by hopf bifurcations in models for dengue , the stabilizing effect of cross immunity shows that it is an important parameter to include when modeling disease fluctuations about equilibria .",
    "in addition , since cross immunity has a strong effect on the period of oscillation , it will play a role in determining the timing of efficient disease control strategies .",
    "when considering strong cross immunity , most of the parameter regions predict unstable steady state behavior , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2_hb_branches_strongci ] .",
    "in fact , when the cross immunity parameter @xmath14 is greater than 0.65 , stable endemic behavior was achieved only for unrealistically large values of ade . as a result , strong cross immunity destabilized the system , and we observed complicated aperiodic fluctuations , such as quasiperiodic behavior and chaotic outbreaks .",
    "in contrast to the synchronized periodic behavior seen for weak cross immunity , we observed that both quasiperiodic and chaotic attractors exhibited strains that were unsynchronized .",
    "asynchrony in chaotic outbreaks has also been observed in multistrain models with ade and no cross immunity @xcite .",
    "because time series data for dengue fever show asynchronous outbreaks for the different strains and non - periodic behavior @xcite , our work suggests possible refined parameter ranges for dengue in terms of ade and cross immunity .",
    "specifically , either the ade or the temporary cross immunity must be strong enough to put the system in the chaotic , desynchronized region , where certain types of unstable steady states were observed .",
    "there is now a need to quantify multistrain models against existing data sets ( such as @xcite ) and further refine parameter estimates .",
    "it should be noted that the model presented here does not include seasonality . because dengue is carried by mosquitoes and",
    "displays outbreaks with a seasonal component , including annual variations in the contact rate will likely be necessary for good quantitative agreement between models and data .",
    "however , other longer period components exist in the data , and are probably due to the interaction between the seasonal contact rate fluctuations and the instabilities induced by the ade and cross imunity parameters . from the ade model analyzed in @xcite",
    ", it was observed that the mean period of oscillations was very sensitive with respect to the ade parameter . in the current work ,",
    "we have also done a preliminary sensitivity analysis of the mean oscillation period on the cross immune response parameter .",
    "here we found that small changes in @xmath14 may yield very large changes in the oscillation period .",
    "therefore , in order to connect the model with measured mean periods from data , both antibody enhancement and cross immunity will play an important role in model prediction and control . in closing , there are many other modeling variations which we have omitted but will refine model fidelity in future work .",
    "these include inhomogeneity in contact rate due to spatial density variation in the mosquito populations , fluctuations in the sociological parameters such as contact , birth and death rates , as well as general stochastic fluctuations in the population itself .",
    "such stochastic effects in finite populations , which can lead to fadeout of the disease , may also impact future disease controls .",
