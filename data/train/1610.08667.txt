    "the rich phenomenology of granular matter , usually defined as systems composed of macroscopic particles that undergo inelastic collisions , is frequently exemplified using grains inside containers and silos @xcite . at mechanical equilibrium ,",
    "all particles stay at rest and the system resembles a solid .",
    "if we open an orifice at the bottom of the silo , grains may start flowing and the system would behave as a fluid .",
    "even more , the system may become a _ granular _ gas if we shake the silo and grains gain enough energy .",
    "the static properties as well as the discharging process of silos has attained much attention in the last years , mostly through experimental and numerical investigations @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , little theoretical results for the silo problem can be found in the literature , even at the dilute limit where there is a fundamental theory of granular matter based on kinetic theory .",
    "one of the objectives of the present work is to contribute to the theoretical study of confined grains by considering a special state of a granular gas inside a curved two - dimensional silo",
    ".    under rapid flow conditions , and using different models of the granular gas , kinetic theory of molecular gases has been modified to account for the inelastic collisions @xcite .",
    "this mesoscopic description , together with an approximate method of solution to the kinetic equation , provides a hydrodynamic or macroscopic one , that usually involves the number density @xmath0 , the velocity flow @xmath1 , and the mean kinetic energy or granular temperature @xmath2 .",
    "as expected , the equation for the temperature contains a sink term that accounts for the energy loss in collisions .",
    "less intuitively , the constitutive relation of the heat flux also modifies as @xcite @xmath3 apart from the term proportional to the temperature gradient ( @xmath4 being the thermal conductivity ) , another one proportional to the density gradient appears ( @xmath5 is known as diffusive conductivity ) .",
    "this new term is purely inelastic in origin , as can be heuristically argued @xcite . under most flow conditions , the contribution of the temperature gradient to the heat flux is dominant .",
    "however , the term proportional to the density gradient becomes important in regions of the system where the temperature gradient is small enough , situation that usually requires the application of an external force .",
    "the presence of the new term in the heat low explains , for example , the non  monotonic temperature dependence on position observed in simulations and experiments @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we identify and fully study the limiting case , namely , a state with homogeneous granular temperature and non  homogeneous density .",
    "it turned out that a very specific external position ",
    "dependent force , or a uniform external force with a curved two  dimensional silo with a very specific form , is required .",
    "this work is divided into several parts . in the next one , the model of a granular gas in a curved two - dimensional silo",
    "is introduced , and equations for three different levels of description are obtained .",

    "this result is exactly demonstrated for the case of a bgk model @xcite , and approximately using the inelastic boltzmann equation for hard spheres .",
    "the last two sections deal with the comparison between theory and numerical simulations and the conclusions , respectively .",
    "the appendixes give extra information about the mathematical calculations and how the numerical simulations were performed , namely event  driven with non  homogeneous external forces .",

    "in this work a steady state of a granular gas with homogeneous granular temperature , zero mean flow , and nonzero heat flux was identified and studied .",
    "the study has been carried out using three complementary approaches : hydrodynamics at navier  stokes order , kinetic theory , and molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "the analysis of the navier ",
    "stokes equations for the granular gas reveals that for the system to reach the desired state , an external position ",
    "dependent force directed along one direction of the system is required . moreover",
    ", the state corresponds to a bulk one , in the sense that it may be reached by the system far enough from the boundaries ( provided hydrodynamic boundary conditions are used ) . since it is experimentally difficult to have a non  homogeneous force acting on the grains without introducing forces among grains , we propose a way to _ create _ the external force by applying an homogeneous external force ( gravitation ) and making the grains live inside a curved two  dimensional silo .",
    "a general position dependent forces can be generated by tuning the form of the silo .",
    "it is worth to mention that the possible frictional force among grains and walls are removed , otherwise other approaches like the ones in @xcite may be required .",
    "moreover , the energy injection needed for the steady state to be reached by the system is done through walls on the bottom and top of the system @xcite , and hence the confined system is not globally fluidizid like in recent studies @xcite .",
    "as the usual navier  stokes description of the granular gas is based on a particular way of applying the chapman - enskog method to solve the inelastic boltzmann equation , and hence its applicability is reduced , we also addressed the direct study of the botlzmann  like equation .",
    "the results of the navier ",
    "stokes equations is completely different from the corresponding mesoscopic description : for a given value of the parameters of the system and for the same form of the external force or shape of the silo , the hydrodynamics supports only one possible values of the macroscopic profiles , given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : c31])([eq : c33 ] ) , while the kinetic equations provide infinite number of them , now given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : c48])([eq : c50 ] ) .",
    "the way the system chooses one of the possible solutions is not only determined by values of the hydrodynamic magnitudes at the boundaries , but also through the specific form of the distribution function . in other words , with the same external force or shape of the silo , we can have infinite situations where the temperature is uniform , the inverse of the number density is linear with @xmath18 , an the scaled distribution function is the same all over the system .    in order to give more support to the theoretical results of the general formulation , we considered not only the usual way of addressing the problem , consisting in solving the boltzmann equation approximately , but also a bgk model and event  driven simulations . on the one hand , for the bgk model , we obtained exact and explicit results for all the macroscopic profiles and the heat flux , eqs ( [ eq : c56 ] ) and ( [ eq : c57 ] ) , and also for the distribution function , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : c53 ] ) and ( [ eq : c54 ] ) . on the other hand , the numerical simulations of the present work",
    "confirm the theoretical predictions at least for weak dissipation , namely @xmath158 .",
    "apart from the important limitation of the simulations , discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] , there is another one related to the nature of our state .",
    "actually , the state we have studied has the particularity of a bulk solution , and for that , the distribution function obeys a scaling form for any position . if we generate at the boundaries a distribution function that is close , but not equal , to the desired one , the system takes more space to transform it into the correct one , since the nature of the state is to keep the scaled distribution function as it is , the boundary layers being bigger and more difficult to remove in this case than in other states .",
    "finally , it is worth to emphasize that the results of the present work seem to reflect an important limitation of the usual inelastic navier ",
    "stokes equations , not only when the system has shear @xcite , but also when nonuniform external forces are applied .",
