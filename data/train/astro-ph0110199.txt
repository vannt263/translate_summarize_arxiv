    "the direct simulation monte carlo method was originally developed to treat rarefied gas flow ( see bird 1994 ; matsuda , mizutani & boffin 2001 ) . in dsmc ,",
    "microscopic molecular motions and their mutual collisions are calculated .",
    "macroscopic quantities such as density , velocity and temperature of fluids are calculated by taking some mean of microscopic quantities . in dsmc ,",
    "molecular collisions are handled in a stochastic manner , hence the monte carlo denomination of the method . the collision model in dsmc is such that the molecules are assumed to be hard billiard balls . since we solve the molecular motions , molecular viscosity and molecular thermal conduction are automatically included in the system .",
    "this physical viscosity may mimic a turbulent viscosity ( @xmath0 viscosity ) assumed in the standard theory of accretion disk .",
    "we consider a binary system with mass ratio @xmath1 .",
    "we work in the rotational frame .",
    "we restrict our computational region to a square , the center of which is the primary and just including the l1 point from which gas particles are injected constantly into the computational region .",
    "the region is divided into @xmath2 cells .",
    "the cell size is such that @xmath3 .",
    "we start injection of gas particles at a constant rate per time step and follow the time evolution of the system .",
    "the number of particles in the computational region increases with time and reaches a steady state . after a steady state",
    "is reached , we further calculate to take a time average .",
    "typically we computed up to t=60 - 100 in dimensionless unit , that is about 10 - 15 orbital periods .    in accretion discs , radiative",
    "cooling must occur , and some mechanism of cooling is essential in our calculation .",
    "we here consider a simple model of cooling : we reduce the thermal speed of the molecules by a factor @xmath4 at each time step .",
    "figure 1 displays the time averaged iso - density surface , on which temperature distribution is pasted , and velocity vectors in the rotational plane of our simulation .",
    "two cases of injected particles number , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , are compared .",
    "we can observe the gas stream from the l1 point , the accretion disc and spiral - shaped shocks . in the case of @xmath5 , we find that the accretion disc is very circular . the l1 stream hitting at the disc is deflected from its direction downward by the disc flow . because of the collision between the l1 stream and the disc flow , the iso - density surface is elevated and the temperature on the elevated area is raised ( a hot line or heated wall ) . in the case of @xmath6 ,",
    "the l1 stream is so strong that the direction of the disc flow is deflected and the disc shape is elongated .",
    "we may observe a pair of spiral shocks in this case .",
