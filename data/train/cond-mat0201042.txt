    "note that for @xmath129 , the quantity @xmath128 is much larger than @xmath130 , which we would expect if the tension were of molecular origin .    in terms of these dimensionless quantities , the filament s tension , @xmath131 ,",

    "the low - resolution , apparent shape of the filament is thus the _ straight line _ joining the two fixed extremities ( fig.[highetlow ] ) .",
    "the filament , described at such low resolutions , behaves therefore effectively as a tense string of tension @xmath148 .",
    "as one pulls on the `` string '' , the apparent contour - length increases ( @xmath149 ) and so does the tension .",

    "for real wormlike chains and in the high tension case , we should actually take into account the finite stretching elasticity of the filament : this would modify our results . we shall therefore concentrate on the medium tension states of the tense regime . the relation @xmath151 yields @xmath155 this represents the free - energy we have to pay in order to increase the apparent contour - length of the filament by a unit amount .",
    "it is worth noticing the intrinsic character of this expression : it is independent both of the microscopic cutoff  @xmath35 and of the resolution  @xmath76 at which the filament is observed . for eq.([sigmalow ] ) to hold , it is necessary that @xmath156 in order to be well into the tense regime ( @xmath157 ) .",
    "we have shown that at spatial resolutions  @xmath76 much less than the wavevector  @xmath158 defined above , a wormlike chain , i.e. , a filament with a bending elasticity  @xmath1 and a fixed contour - length  @xmath0 , behaves as a _",
