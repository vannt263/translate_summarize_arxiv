    "furthermore , rr  lyr stars offer the opportunity to study the morphology of the horizontal branch and the oosterhoff dichotomy @xcite .",
    "current empirical evidence indicates that the mean period of fundamental mode ( rrab or fu ) rr  lyr stars in galactic globular clusters ( ggcs hereafter ) shows a dichotomous distribution at 0.55 ( ooi ) and 0.65 ( ooii ) days @xcite , where the latter group is more metal - poor .",
    "there is also evidence that the dichotomy is the aftermath of the hysteresis mechanism suggested by @xcite , i.e. that the pulsation mode depends on the direction of the evolution inside the instability strip @xcite . @xcite",
    "employed the rr  lyr stars as a probe to identify the two main stellar populations in the galaxy , as well as to study the stellar content of the galactic bulge through low - reddening regions @xcite .    beyond stellar evolution ,",
    "rr  lyr variables have also played a key role in providing estimates of cosmological parameters , and have been instrumental in measuring the distances to a sizable sample of ggcs .",
    "this allowed the estimation of absolute cluster ages , and in turn set the lower limit on the age of the universe @xcite .",
    "moreover , rr  lyr variables have been used to estimate the primordial helium content using the a - parameter , i.e. the mass to luminosity relation of low - mass central helium - burning stars @xcite .",
    "rr  lyr stars are also the most commonly adopted population ii distance indicator . with a lower mass than classical cepheids",
    ", they have the key advantage to be ubiquitous , and have been identified in both early and late type stellar systems @xcite .",
    "their individual distances can be evaluated using multiple diagnostics , including a visual magnitude - metallicity relation @xcite and a statistical parallax @xcite .",
    "more importantly , they obey to well defined near - infrared ( nir ) period - luminosity ( pl ) relations @xcite .",
    "these pl relations extend to mid - infrared ( mir ) bands where they have the potential of being very accurate distance indicators due to lower extinction and smaller intrinsic scatter @xcite . the use of the i , v - i reddening free period - wesenheit ( pw ) relation to estimate the individual distances of rr  lyr stars dates back to @xcite and to @xcite .",
    "a more recent theoretical framework developed by @xcite further supports the use of optical , optical - nir , and nir period - wesenheit - metallicity ( pwz ) relations to determine individual distances of rr  lyr stars .",

    "rr  lyr mir pl relations will be used as the foundation of an independent population ii cosmological distance scale to calibrate trgb distances for nearby distances , which in turn can be used to calibrate type ia supernova distances . to achieve this goal , we observed over 1,700 rr  lyr variables in 31 selected ggcs , as well as @xmath2 rr  lyr stars in strategically distributed areas in the galactic halo and the bulge .",
    "in addition , we observed 48 of the nearest , brightest and less reddened rr  lyr stars intended to be used as zero point calibrators .",

    "the results of our ground - based optical and nir monitoring of the stellar population in m4 have been published in @xcite and @xcite . in this paper",
    "we extend our wavelength coverage to the mir , by including multi - epoch 3.6 and 4.5   photometry of a large portion of the cluster .",
    "our irac observations of m4 were executed on 2013 june 2 - 3 as part of the warm spitzer space telescope cycle  9 ( pid 90088 ) .",
    "the cluster was observed at irac 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath5 bands at 12 equally spaced epochs over @xmath6 hours . for each epoch we obtained 30 frames with a medium scale five - point gaussian dither pattern and a @xmath7 mapping , taken using the irac full frame mode with a frame time of 30 seconds to provide a median total exposure of 804  seconds per pixel .",
    "an @xmath8 area at the center of the cluster was covered in both the 3.6 and 4.5   bands . due to the irac focal plane array configuration , in the outer regions of the cluster",
    "only one band is available , with the area just north of the center of the cluster only covered at 3.6   and the region south of the center only covered at 4.5  .",
    "the total area mapped by our observations covers a strip of @xmath9 , roughly cutting north - to - south through the center of the cluster , as shown in figure  [ fig : map ] .",
    "this is about one third of the total cluster area that was mapped in our ground - based optical and nir observations , but is still @xmath10 the size of the half - mass radius of m4 ( @xmath11 according to @xcite ) .",
    "the crrp irac data were reduced starting from the basic calibrated data ( bcds ) generated by the spitzer irac pipeline version s19.1.0 .",
    "photometry was performed using the most recent version of the daophot / allstar / allframe suite of programs for crowded - field stellar photometry @xcite . in order to mitigate the effect of blending in the photometry of the m4 crowded field , we used an input source catalog derived by the higher angular resolution optical and nir images described in @xcite .",
    "in addition to higher resolution , this input source catalog is also deeper . for the optical and nir ,",
    "accurate photometry was achieved down to 24 and 22 magnitudes respectively , compared to 17 mag for the mir images .",
    "this catalog was matched to the spitzer data after applying higher order geometric corrections to the individual irac bcds than the default ones provided by the spitzer irac pipeline . with this procedure",
    "we matched 17,595 sources at 3.6   and 16,313 sources at 4.5  , for which we measured an instrumental magnitude with variable point spread function ( psf ) fitting .",
    "the astrometric accuracy of our final source catalog is of the order of @xmath12 .    for the optical and nir images , good photometry",
    "was achieved down to 24 and 20 magnitudes respectively    the photometry was calibrated to standard irac vega magnitudes using aperture photometry on mosaic images .",
    "the mosaics were generated using the iracproc package @xcite , a perl data language wrapper script for the standard spitzer science center mosaicking software mopex @xcite .",
    "we adopted a mosaic pixel scale of 0.61@xmath13/pix , or half the native irac pixel scale .",
    "the stars we selected for aperture photometry calibration are far from the center of the cluster to reduce blending .",
    "in addition , we removed any possible variable stars , by avoiding sources with a welch & stetson variability index @xcite greater than @xmath14 from the median .",
    "we selected a total of 38 stars at 3.6   and 44 at 4.5  .",
    "we used an aperture of 3 native irac pixels ( @xmath15 ) with an annulus of 3 to 7 pixels ( @xmath16 to @xmath17 ) .",
    "the aperture corrections necessary to convert magnitudes derived with this aperture / annulus combination to the standard irac 10 pixel aperture photometry are 1.1284 and 1.1274 for 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath5 respectively , calculated on isolated stars in the mosaics .",
    "the calibrating stars cover a range of 4 magnitudes and are distributed randomly across the array , outside of the central region .    despite the relatively small size of our adopted photometric apertures , the crowding of the field even outside the center of the cluster ( m4 is projected behind the scorpius - ophiuchus cloud complex ) still results in blending contamination of aperture photometry for our calibration sources .",
    "these blended sources are however in many cases resolved by the psf fitting procedure performed in daophot on the higher resolution visible and nir images , from which our input catalog is derived .",
    "we thus used our point source photometric catalog to improve the photometric zero point calibration by subtracting from the calibrator aperture photometry the flux ( measured from the psf - fitting photometry ) of any blended sources found within our chosen aperture . for each blended source we estimated the contaminating flux by measuring the fraction of its flux falling within our 3 pixel aperture , as a function of its centroid distance from the aperture s center .",
    "for this task we used the irac psf described in @xcite , taking advantage of its higher sampling ( @xmath18 of the native irac pixels ) to derive corrections for fractional pixel shifts . at 3.6   17 of our 38 calibrators",
    "were found to be contaminated by an average of 0.03 mag .",
    "the 4.5   region was less crowded , resulting in only 7 out of 44 contaminated calibrators , but contaminated by 0.11 mag on average .",
    "the magnitudes of the de - blended calibrators were then subtracted from their daophot instrumental magnitudes to derive the final calibration zero point .",
    "we found no trend in the calibration zero point with either brightness or array location .",
    "the uncertainty in our final calibration is 0.018 mag at 3.6   and 0.017 mag at 4.5  , based on the standard deviation between the instrumental and measured magnitudes .",
    "this standard deviation of the calibration increases dramatically for the fainter stars in our calibration sample . if we select only calibrating stars brighter than 14 mag , then the error in the calibration is reduced to 0.015 at 3.6   and 0.013 at 4.5  .    at the end of this process",
    ", we obtained a photometric catalog in both irac bands for all point sources detected in our field of view . from this catalog we matched 37 of the 45 rr  lyr stars with optical photometry derived by @xcite , 26 of them fundamental mode ( fu , rrab ) pulsators , and 11 pulsating in first overtone ( fo , rrc ) .",
    "of the remaining eight rr  lyr stars in the cluster , seven are outside the area mapped in at least one of the two irac bands , and one ( v64 ) is a field variable in the background of the cluster , too faint to be detected by irac .",
    "all m4 rr  lyr stars are indicated in figure  [ fig : map ] by squares , with open red and filled blue symbols for fu and fo rr  lyr stars detected in at least one irac band .",
    "the final magnitude of each non - variable star was derived by averaging the value measured in all epochs and in all dithers . for the rr",
    "lyr variables we instead preserved the photometry for each epoch , averaging only on the individual dithers , after correcting the photometry in each dither for the warm spitzer location - dependent photometric corrections available at the spitzer science center web site .",
    "the photometric uncertainty in each epoch is given by the standard deviation of all of the available measurements .",
    "a sample of the individual data points for one star , v1 , is given in table  [ tab : phot ] ; all data is available in the online version of this article .",
    "a few rr  lyr stars were covered in only one of the five dither positions , and one magnitude measurement was available in each epoch . for these stars",
    "( v1 , v42 , v2 , and v29 ) the photometric uncertainty is instead derived from the _ repeatability _ parameter provided by daophot , which tends to be larger than the photometric error based exclusively on photon and background noise .",
    "our mir sample of m4 rr  lyr variables consists of 37 stars , whose location is shown in figure  [ fig : map ] . of those , 26 are pulsating in fundamental mode ( fu , rrab ) and 11 are first overtone pulsators ( fo , rrc ) .",
    "not all sources have complete coverage in the irac dataset : of the 37 rr  lyr stars in the area mapped by at least one irac band , only 28 have photometry at both 3.6 and 4.5  , with six sources covered only at 3.6   and three covered only at 4.5  .",
    "the periods of our rr  lyr stars range between 0.2275  days ( v49 ) to 0.6240 days ( v39 ) , plus a long - period fu rr  lyr ( v52 ) with a period of 0.8555 days .",

    "the fo and fu rr  lyr stars are represented by filled blue and open red squares respectively .",
    "we see a clear separation of the fo and fu rr  lyr stars in the horizontal branch of the cmd , with the fo bluer than the fu variables ( _ right panels _ ) .",
    "we derived mir light curves for each rr  lyr in our catalog by phasing their multiple - epoch photometry based on the epoch of maximum ( @xmath21 ) and the period derived by @xcite using the lomb - scargle method from the visible data .",
    "sample light curves are shown in figure  [ fig : fo - lightcurves ] for fo variables and [ fig : fu - lightcurves ] for fu variables .",
    "the light curves are shown in order of increasing period . following @xcite , for each star we derived a smoothed light curve using a gaussian local estimation ( gloess ) algorithm , a method where a second - order polynomial is fit locally and points are weighted by their gaussian distance from an interpolation point .",
    "a full description of the gloess method is given in @xcite .",
    "the mean magnitude for all stars was then determined by integrating the smoothed light curve flux intensity over one period , then converting the result back into a magnitude . the variability amplitude in magnitude",
    "was also derived from the smoothed light curve , and the uncertainty is calculated using only the data points that lie within the gaussian window of the maximum and minimum of the smoothed curve .",
    "the uncertainty in the mean magnitude is calculated by the sum in quadrature of photometric uncertainty of each observation ( @xmath22 ) and the uncertainty in the fit ( @xmath23 ) where @xmath24 is the number of observations , @xmath25 is the photometric uncertainty , @xmath26 is the peak - to - peak amplitude , and @xmath27 is the number of uniformly spaced points ( following * ? ? ?",
    "the value of @xmath27 ranges from five to twelve ; five",
    "( e.g. v41 ) when our observations cover more than two periods and twelve when our observations cover one complete period ( e.g. v5 ) .",
    "some light curves however were randomly sampled ( e.g. v52 , where the observations do not cover a full period ) , and the uncertainty in the fit is instead @xmath28 where n is the total number of observations .",
    "table  [ tab : smean ] gives the 3.6 and 4.5   irac mean magnitudes and amplitudes for the 37 rr  lyr stars in the irac field .",
    "figure  [ fig : bailey ] shows the luminosity amplitude vs. period ( bailey diagram ) for all rr  lyr stars : filled blue squares for fo and open red squares for fu pulsators .",
    "black crosses indicate fu rr  lyr stars identified in @xcite as blazhko variables ( the blazhko effect is characterized by a conspicuous modulation of amplitude and phase ; @xcite ) .",
    "recent long - term monitoring of blazhko rr  lyr by the kepler satellite has provided evidence of not only period - doubling @xcite but also the possible occurrence of additional periodicities on a time - scale longer than the typical blazhko period @xcite .",
    "as expected the fo and fu rr  lyr variables are well separated in both period and amplitude , and the amplitude of the fu pulsators show a clear trend of decreasing with period .",
    "figure  [ fig : ap ] shows instead the amplitude ratio between optical bands and the irac 3.6   band .",
    "the amplitude ratio plot can be used as a diagnostic for blends of stars with different color temperature .",
    "two fo rr  lyr stars ( v40 and c1 ) show an unusually high optical to mir ratio , possibly indicative of the presence of a faint optically - bright ( hot ) companion or blend .",
    "another fo rr  lyr ( v49 ) shows instead an unusually low amplitude ratio , possibly the consequence of having an infrared - bright ( cool ) companion ( or blend ) .",
    "it is also interesting to note that several ( four out of seven at 3.6   and four out of six at 4.5  ) of the fu rr  lyr stars that lie below the general amplitude ratio trend are blazhko variables , possibly due to these stars being observed at different phases in their amplitude modulation cycle ( the optical and mir data were not acquired simultaneously ) .",
    "if this is the case , the remaining fu rr  lyr stars in the same amplitude ratio group ( v5 , v3 , and v52 ) could also be blazhko stars that were missed by the period studies ( or they could be stars with a faint cool companion or blend ) .",
    "the left panels of figure  [ fig : pl - warm ] show the irac pl relation for fo ( filled blue squares ) and fu ( open red squares ) rr  lyr stars in m4 .",
    "blazhko variables are indicated by black crosses .",
    "the statistical uncertainties of the mean magnitudes are smaller than the size of the plotted symbols , and are not shown .",
    "residuals from the pl relation were used as a diagnostic for blended variables .",
    "the central regions of m4 are not particularly dense , and no clear cutoff in radial distance from the center was apparent .",
    "instead we employed a threshold in sigma to identify candidate blends .",
    "two stars , v20 and v21 , in the central regions of the cluster fall outside the threshold .",
    "the variable v20 was over @xmath29 above the fitted pl relation , and as shown in figure  [ fig : fu - lightcurves ] , has a very poor quality light curve .",
    "the average magnitude of v21 was more than @xmath30 above the fitted relation .",
    "these stars were not included in the final fit of the pl relations , and are shown in figure  [ fig : pl - warm ] as open circles .",
    "all average magnitudes are corrected for extinction ; albeit mir extinction corrections are small compared to optical wavelengths , they still can not be ignored given the high photometric accuracy provided by irac .",
    "we used the total - to - selective extinctions of @xmath31}/e(b - v ) = 0.203 $ ] and @xmath32}/e(b - v ) = 0.156 $ ] from @xcite and a color excess of @xmath33 from @xcite .",
    "this results in extinction corrections of @xmath34 and @xmath35 mag at 3.6 and 4.5  , respectively .",
    "we calculated the zero point and slope ( with their uncertainties and the best fit standard deviation ) for the pl relation using an unweighted least squares fit .",
    "an unweighted fit is preferred to avoid biasing by brighter longer period variables , which tend to have smaller photometric uncertainties .",
    "the pl relations take the form @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are representative of the mean period of the fo and fu variables respectively .",
    "the scatter between the fo and fu pl relations is comparable . due to the small number of fo variables",
    ", we also derived the global pl relations for all rr  lyr stars ( figure  [ fig : pl - warm ] , _ right _ ) , having _ fundamentalized _ the periods of the fo variables using the relation @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "the fundamentalized pl relation takes the form @xmath40 where @xmath41 is representative of the mean fundamentalized period of all rr  lyr stars in our sample .",
    "the zero point @xmath42 , slope @xmath43 , their errors , and the standard deviations for all pl relations are given in table  [ tab : pl ] .",
    "note how the secondary modulation of the candidate blazhko variables seem to have no measurable effect on their average magnitudes , as they fit well on the pl relation .",
    "figure  4 in @xcite showed that , using available data , the slope of the rr  lyr pl relation is a monotonically increasing function of wavelength , and asymptotically approaches a wavelength - independent slope . in figure  [ fig : pl - parameters ] , we recreate this plot by adding the optical and near - infrared slopes from @xcite , the irac mir slopes calculated above , and the results from @xcite .",
    "our data is consistent with the values found by @xcite and @xcite for the wise w1 and w2 bands , and confirm with a high level of accuracy that the slope approaches the value of @xmath44 at infrared wavelengths , as predicted by the period - radius relation in @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : pc ] shows optical and infrared period - color ( pc ) relations for all m4 rr  lyr variables observed with irac ( as before , filled blue and open red squares indicate fundamentalized fo and fu ) .",
    "we fit the data with an unweighted least squares procedure ; the best fit parameters are listed in table  [ tab : pc ] .",
    "the figure clearly shows how the slope of the pc relation becomes more shallow as the distance between the two passbands decreases , as expected if the color is a temperature effect related to the radius of the pulsator .",
    "the @xmath45 pc relation , in particular , has been singled out for being the least affected by temperature uncertainties when deriving rr  lyr distances with the baade - wesselink method @xcite , as opposed to using the standard @xmath46 color .",
    "our figure shows that pc relationships using mir colors ( and the irac 3.6   magnitude in particular ) are even more advantageous , thanks to the steeper slope ( i.e. @xmath47 for the @xmath48 $ ] relation vs. @xmath49 in the @xmath45 fit ) and slightly smaller dispersion around the best fit relation .",
    "the last panel in figure  [ fig : pc ] shows the irac @xmath50 - [ 4.5]$ ] pc relation . in this case",
    "the slope is very shallow ( @xmath51 ) , consistent with zero within @xmath52 .",
    "the scatter around the best fit pc relation is also quite large ( 0.017  mag ) , three times larger than the uncertainty in the average magnitudes of individual stars .",
    "the lack of a significant @xmath50 - [ 4.5]$ ] pc relation for rr  lyr stars suggests that these stars do not develop variable co molecular absorption in their atmosphere , which is observed in other pulsating stars in the same instability strip ( e.g. classical cepheids ) .",
    "@xcite found a well defined @xmath50 - [ 4.5]$ ] pc relation for large magellanic cloud cepheids with @xmath53 .",
    "the negative slope of the pc relation and blue colors of these stars is explained by the dissociation and recombination of co molecules in the irac 4.5   band , as previously noted by @xcite .",
    "this effect is particularly strong in cepheids with @xmath54  days , and is reflected in a precise phasing of the light and color curve of these stars .",
    "shorter period cepheids are instead characterized by a flat color curve and red colors .",
    "this is further supported by @xcite , which found that co absorption drops off for temperatures greater than 6000 k. given that these rr  lyr stars have higher effective temperatures , earlier spectral types and lower metallicity than cepheids , it is not surprising that we do not find strong co effects in the pc relation and color curve .",
    "the @xmath50 - [ 4.5]$ ] pc relation appears to be flat , even when including galactic rr  lyr stars with very different metallicities .",
    "therefore , rr  lyr observations at 4.5   are not limited by strong metallicity effects as cepheids are , and this band can be successfully used for distance scale measurements with similar accuracy as the 3.6   band .",
    "the weakness of the 4.5   co band in rr  lyr stars , however , prevents this feature from being used as metallicity indicator for this class of variables .",
    "the crrp project relies on establishing rr  lyr variables as highly accurate indicators for the first rung of the cosmological distance scale , by using their mir pl relation .",
    "the zero point of this relation , however , needs to be calibrated .",
    "efforts in this direction have been made in the recent past by using galactic rr  lyr stars observed by wise @xcite , but the accuracy of the calibration has been limited by the uncertainties in the photometry and distance of the calibrators . as mentioned in section  [ sec : intro ] , the crrp project addresses this issue with the observations of 43 galactic rr  lyr stars whose geometric parallax will be determined better than 2 - 3% with gaia , and five bright rr  lyr stars with parallax already determined by @xcite using the hubble space telescope ( hst ) fine guidance sensor ( fgs ) .",
    "ground - based monitoring and spectral observations of the calibrators is ongoing , to ensure the characterization of their pulsation properties and , if required , to allow the calibration of the metallicity dependence of the pl relation .",
    "the observation of a large sample of ggcs ( themselves used as distance indicators ) as part of the crrp program provides a separate avenue to test the calibration of rr  lyr stars and probe for metallicity effects .",
    "the distance of m4 , in particular , has been the subject of intense analysis , most recently by @xcite by using a theoretical and empirical calibration of the rr  lyr optical and nir pl relation for the cluster .",
    "the distance modulus derived in this work can be used as an alternative calibration of the mir pl zero point , as well as to test the effects of metallicity on the zero point derived from the five hst / fgs rr  lyr calibrating stars .",
    "a similar approach will be followed for the remaining 30 gccs in the crrp program ( spanning a wide range in metallicity ) , for which independent distance moduli will be derived in the optical , nir and mir from their population of rr  lyr stars .      as mentioned above , at present",
    "there are only five rr  lyr variables with available geometric parallax , i.e. the aforementioned stars observed with hst / fgs by @xcite : rr  lyr , uv  oct , su  dra xz  cyg ( fu pulsators ) and rz  cep ( fo ) .",
    "the four fu pulsators are the same stars used by @xcite to calibrate the rr  lyr pl relation in the wise bands . even for these stars , however , the uncertainty in their distance modulus is still large ( up to 0.25  mag ) , significantly reducing their effectiveness as calibrators for the distance scale .",
    "all five stars have been observed as part of the crrp program in order to reproduce the @xcite zero point calibration using the irac 3.6 and 4.5   bandpasses , and with better phase sampling and much smaller ( @xmath55 better s / n ratio ) photometric error .",
    "their basic properties ( derived from @xcite ) are listed in table  [ tab : gal ] : their periods range from 0.3086 to 0.6642  days , and their [ fe / h ] ranges from @xmath56 to @xmath57 , significantly more metal - poor than m4 itself . a detailed analysis of the calibration of the zero point using these five rr  lyr stars at multi  wavelengths will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the mean magnitude of each star was computed as explained in section  [ sec : mags ] .",
    "each calibrator was then corrected for extinction , adopting the @xmath58 reddening from @xcite .",
    "the extinction corrections were computed using the same @xmath59 and @xmath60 relations as in section  [ sec : mags ] .",
    "the absolute mean magnitudes , as well as the parallax , lkh correction @xcite , distance moduli , extinction corrections , and apparent mean magnitudes are given in table  [ tab : gal ] .",
    "@xcite contains two conflicting results about the parallax to rz cep and although the value of 2.12 mas is their preferred solution ( benedict , private communication ) , we chose to adopt the 2.54 mas solution with an @xmath61 of 1 ( assuming a mean spectral type of a5 @xcite and @xmath62 ) which appears to be more consistent with the new photometric data .",
    "the dominating factor in the uncertainty of the absolute mean magnitudes is the uncertainty in their distances .",
    "based on theoretical nir pl - metallicity ( plz ) relations , the slope of the rr  lyr pl relation is expected to be only weakly dependent on metallicity @xcite . therefore , for this work we elected to adopt the well constrained slope of the fundamentalized pl relation derived in section  [ sec : pl ] , rather than relying on just five galactic calibrators ( having a smaller range in period than the m4 rr  lyr stars ) to simultaneously fit both slope and zero point .",

    "the largest factor in the uncertainty of the zero point derived above is due to the uncertainty in the distance modulus of the calibrators , but it is a factor of 3 better than the value obtained in @xcite where both the slope and zero point were fit simultaneously and only four stars were used . in both irac bands , the slope we obtain is marginally shallower ( but still consistent , within the error ) than the values published by @xcite and @xcite for the wise w1 and w2 bands .",
    "further improvements in the uncertainty of the zero point will be possible when more accurate parallaxes for all our calibrator rr  lyr stars are obtained with the gaia mission .",
    "from the zero point calibration of the mir rr  lyr pl relation in the previous section , we can derive the true distance modulus of m4 :    @xmath65 } = 11.406 \\pm 0.010 \\ , ( \\textrm{stat } ) \\pm 0.080 \\ , ( \\textrm{syst } ) \\\\",

    "the error on the distance modulus comes from four sources .",
    "the _ statistical _ error is the uncertainty in the zero point of the cluster pl relation , and is derived from the least squares fit to the irac data .",

    "if we exclude the systematic error , which will be significantly reduced once high accuracy geometric parallaxes for a large sample of calibrators will become available from gaia , we have an overall uncertainty better than 0.5% in each band .",
    "the average distance modulus of the two wavelengths then is :    @xmath70    where the statistical error is reduced by a factor of @xmath71 ( since by using both bands we take advantage of twice the number of available datapoints ) .",
    "note that in this case the overall error is reduced to 1% , small enough to allow the study of higher order parameters in the rr  lyr pl relation , first of all the possible dependence on metallicity , once data from more clusters is analyzed .",
    "based on the models presented in @xcite , while the dependence of the pl slope from metallicity is weak , we do expect a larger effect of [ fe / h ] on the pl relation zero point . therefore calibrating the pl relation with galactic rr  lyr stars ,",
    "all with different metallicities , may induce a significant error . figure  [ fig : met ] addresses this issue , by plotting the residual between the absolute mean magnitude of each calibrator and the value predicted by the pl relation , as a function of their metallicity .",
    "the metallicities used in the plot are listed in table  [ tab : gal ] , and are the same listed in @xcite ( see references therein for the original source of the metallicity measurement ) , converted from the original @xcite metallicity scale to the more recent @xcite scale .",
    "for rr  lyr and uv  oct an extra step was necessary to correct for the different solar abundances used by @xcite when measuring the metallicity of these two stars , with respect to the @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : met ] also plots the difference between the m4 distance modulus calculated above for m4 , and the value of @xmath68 derived by @xcite from nir pl relations calibrated using rr  lyr . due to the large uncertainties in absolute magnitude and metallicity of the galactic rr  lyr stars , no trend is apparent ( slope of -0.2@xmath720.3 mag / dex ) .",
    "if we adopt the m4 distance modulus value of @xmath73 derived by @xcite from nir data and _ theoretical _ plz relationships for rr  lyr stars ( to avoid the large uncertainty in the calibrator distance that is affecting the zero point calibration ) , we obtain the following calibrated rr  lyr pl relations for the two irac bands :    @xmath63}=-2.332 ( \\pm 0.106 ) \\log(p ) - 1.054 ( \\pm 0.020 ) \\\\ m_{[4.5]}=-2.336 ( \\pm 0.105 ) \\log(p ) - 1.091 ( \\pm 0.020 ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    an in - depth study of the mir rr  lyr pl relations based on theoretical models calculated for the irac bands will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",

    "accurate irac photometry allows us to reduce the error in the pl slope by a factor of at least two from previous works .",
    "we have also demonstrated that pl relations in the irac bands are consistent with previous calibrations using wise photometry .",
    "we also presented optical and infrared pc relations .",
    "the steeper slope and smaller dispersion of the @xmath48 $ ] relation suggests that it could be preferred over @xmath74 for use in the baade - wesselink method . unlike for cepheid variables ,",
    "the @xmath50 - [ 4.5]$ ] relation is very shallow , indicating that there is no co absorption , and therefore little metallicity effect , in the 4.5   band . as a result",
    ", the 4.5   band can be used as a distance indicator .",
    "we calibrated the zero point of the mir pl relations with five galactic rr  lyr stars with known distances .",
    "the uncertainty in their distances is the largest source of error , and we will be able to provide a much more precise calibration using upcoming results from the gaia mission . due to the uncertainty of the available distances to galactic rr  lyr stars and the influence of metallicity in the pl relation , we provided a separate pl relation , where the zero point is calibrated using a distance modulus to m4 based on theoretical nir plz relations .",
