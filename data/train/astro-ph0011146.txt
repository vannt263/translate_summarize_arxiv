    "in the past kinematic and dynamical studies of disc galaxies have been mainly focused on late - type spirals . with respect to lenticular and early - type spiral galaxies ( defined as those with @xmath3 , following simien & de vaucouleurs 1986 ) ,",
    "the study of late - type spirals has many advantages from both the observational and interpretative points of view .",
    "late - type spirals have small or even negligible bulges , so they are usually described as luminous discs embedded in dark matter halos .",
    "they are on average more gas - rich than early - type spirals .",
    "gas is mainly confined in the galactic disc , considered moving at circular speed and therefore used as direct tracer of the gravitational potential .",
    "since the line - of - sight velocity distribution ( losvd hereafter ) of ionized or neutral hydrogen is easier to measure than the stellar one , the number of spirals of known gaseous kinematics increased faster than that of the galaxies for which stellar motions were measured .",
    "these facts made late - type spirals easy targets , particularly in the search for dark matter ( see sofue & rubin 2001 for a review ) .",
    "only recently heraudeau & simien ( 1998 ) and heraudeau et al .",
    "( 1999 ) measured the stellar rotation curves and velocity - dispersion profiles along the major axis of a large sample of spirals ( more than 60 objects ) ranging from sa to sc . in last years",
    "systematic surveys have been started to derive the stellar and gaseous kinematics in s0 s ( bertola et al .",
    "1995 ; fisher 1997 ; bettoni & galletta 1997 ) and in early - to - intermediate type spirals ( corsini et al . 1999",
    "; vega beltrn 1999 ; vega beltrn et al . 2000 ) .",
    "if the direct comparison of stellar and gaseous kinematics allowed to unveil also in disc galaxies the presence of kinematically - decoupled components ( see bertola & corsini 1999 for a recent review ) , the application of dynamical models showed that in the bulge - dominated region the ionized - gas velocity may fall below the circular speed ( fillmore , boroson & dressler 1986 ; kent 1988 ; kormendy & westpfahl 1989 ) .",
    "these ` slowly - rising ' rotation curves have been interpreted as the signature of the presence of pressure - supported gas ( bertola et al .",
    "1995 ; cinzano et al .",
    "1999 ) , which has been recently expelled by stars of the bulge but not yet heated to the virial temperature of the galaxy .",
    "this discovery poses new questions about the reliability of galaxy mass distributions derived by the decomposition of the observed ionized - gas rotation curve into the contributions of luminous and dark matter .",
    "in fact the inner gradient of the gas velocity curve is usually used to fix the amount of luminous matter , which results to be underestimated if gas velocity rises slowly than circular speed .    in this paper",
    "we present a study of the ionized - gas and stellar kinematics for 3 sa  sb galaxies , namely ngc 772 , ngc 3898 , and ngc 7782 .",
    "we apply a self - consistent dynamical model based on a two - dimensional photometric decomposition method to explain the different kinematical behaviour of gas and stars .",
    "the goal of this work is to derive the mass distribution of these objects and investigate the possible presence of non - circular gas motions in the bulge region .",
    "the paper is organized as it follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec : properties ] we give an overview of the properties of ngc 772 , ngc 3898 and ngc 7782 ; in sect .",
    "[ sec : observations ] we present the broad and narrow - band imaging and major - axis kinematics of stars and ionized gas ; in sect .  [ sec : structure ] we discuss the photometric and dynamical techniques adopted to investigate the light and mass distribution of these galaxies ; in sect .",
    "[ sec : results ] we apply these techniques to the galaxies , deriving their structural and kinematic parameters ; finally , sect .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] is devoted to the discussion of the results and conclusions .",
    "the galaxies studied in this paper are a subset of the 20 disc galaxies observed by vega beltrn et al .",
    "all these galaxies are bright ( @xmath4 ) and nearby objects ( @xmath5 ) with an intermediate - to - high inclination ( @xmath6 ) and their hubble morphological types run from s0 to sc .",
    "since the presence of ionized - gas supported by non - circular motions have been observed only in lenticular or bulge - dominated spiral galaxies , we focused our attention on s0  sb galaxies .",
    "we selected unbarred galaxies according to the classification of both sandage & tammann ( 1981 , hereafter rsa ) and de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "( 1991 , hereafter rc3 ) . to better disentangle the contributions of the bulge , the disc and eventually of the dark matter halo to the total mass of the galaxy we choosed between the sample objects those with the more extended ionized - gas and stellar kinematics ( in units of @xmath7 ) .",
    "at the end of this selection process we remained with five galaxies : an s0 ( ngc  980 ) , two sa ( ngc  772 and ngc  5064 ) and two sb spirals ( ngc  3898 and ngc  7782 ) .",
    "all the selected galaxies display a smooth and regular morphology , except for ngc 772 which is characterized by a strong lopsidedness ( fig .",
    "[ fig : n772_halpha ] ) .",
    "however the symmetry of velocity curves and velocity - dispersion profiles of both ionized gas and stars ( fig .",
    "[ fig : n772_kinematics ] ) suggests us that also ngc 772 has an axisymmetric structure at least in the radial region were the kinematic parameters were measured ( corresponding to @xmath8 ) .",
    "an accurate analysis of the photometric and kinematic properties of the selected galaxies ( see vega beltrn 1999 for details ) showed that the surface brightness of ngc  980 is characterized by a strong twisting of the isophotes and that the losvd profiles of ngc 5064 have a strongly non - gaussian shape .",
    "we interpreted these two phenomena as due to the misalignment between bulge and disc of ngc  980 ( or even to the presence of a triaxial bulge ) and to the possible coexistence in ngc  5064 of two counterrotating components , respectively .",
    "therefore the two galaxies were discarded and are not studied here .",
    "an overview of the properties of the remaining galaxies , namely ngc 772 , ngc 3898 and ngc 7782 which will be the subject of our investigation , is given in table [ tab : properties ] .",

    "the observed velocity dispersion of the ionized gas is comparable to the stellar velocity dispersion and is far higher than expected from the thermal motions or small - scale turbulence , typically observed in a gaseous disc .",

    ", the gas rotation curve of ngc 3898 can be classified as ` slowly - rising ' , since for the inner @xmath91 ionized gas is rotating more slowly than the circular velocity predicted by dynamical modelling .",
    "ngc 3898 is the only galaxy of our sample for which previous determinations of the masses of the bulge and disc components are available in the literature ( kent 1988 ; fillmore et al .",
    "1986 ; moriondo et al .",
    "comparison shows that ngc 3898 is a clearcut example that mass decomposition based only on emission - line rotation curves can be unreliable , at least for bulge - dominated galaxies .",
    "this error was made and discussed by kent ( 1988 ) and moriondo et al .",
    "( 1998b ) , who assumed the gas to be rotating at circular velocity at all radii and found extraordinarily low values for the mass - to - light ratio of the spheroidal component , as if ngc 3898 was an almost ` bulge - less ' galaxy in spite of its overall morphology ( see table [ tab : properties ] and figs .",
    "[ fig : n3898_kinematics ] , and [ fig : n3898_halpha ] ) and bulge - to - disc luminosity ratio ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "the asymmetry of the gas rotation curve of ngc 3898 ( with a maximum @xmath93 between the two sides of about 80  at @xmath94 from the centre ) , and the strong difference between the gas ( @xmath95 ) and the stellar velocity dispersion ( @xmath96  with a central peak to @xmath97 ) in the innermost @xmath98 ( where we observe almost the same velocity gradient for both gas and stars ) are an indication that along with random motions other phenomena could also be contributing to the slowly rise of the gas velocity .",
    "this is the case of other galaxies with slowly - rising rotation curves , such as the sa ngc 2775 ( corsini et al .",
    "1999 ) and the s0 ngc 4036 ( cinzano et al .",
    "the asymmetry of the inner parts of the gas rotation curve of ngc 2775 has been explained as due to a gaseous component which is not rotating in the galaxy plane , and the possible presence of drag forces between the ionized gas and the hot component of the interstellar medium of ngc 4036 has been suggested ( for a discussion of the phenomenon see cinzano et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "finally , in ngc  7782 the gas rotation curve shows small deviations from pure circular rotation only in the transition region between bulge and disc .",
    "any evidence for possible non - circular motions is marginal and the sharp increase of the gas velocity dispersion towards the nucleus can be better explained as due to a seeing effect as in the case of ngc 772 .",
    "as far as the presence of dark matter is concerned , we infer that the mass is essentially traced by light in ngc 772 and ngc 7782 , where gas rotation velocities were observed out to @xmath8 and @xmath99 , respectively . for ngc 3898 the combined stellar and gaseous rotation data ( which extend out to @xmath8 and @xmath100 respectively )",
    "require the presence of a massive dark halo .",
    "this result is based on the idea that gas kinematics at large radii is representative of a dynamically cold disc supported by rotation , as suggested by the high gas rotation velocity and low velocity dispersion ( @xmath101 ) for @xmath102 ( corresponding to about @xmath8 ) .",
    "this result also qualitatively agrees with the general dark matter scenario , with the less massive galaxies being the more dark - matter dominated ( salucci & persic 1999 ) , although these data do not permit a careful measurement of the dark halo properties .",
    "kent ( 1988 ) found that , out of the 14 sa galaxies he modeled , six show gas rotation curves that rise too slowly for a constant mass - to - light ratio implying they are respectively too low for the bulges and too high for the disc components .",
    "according to table  [ tab : slowlyrising ] , the gas motion is not circular in the inner regions of 6 of the 9 early - to - intermediate disc galaxies , for which dynamical modelling allows the direct comparison between the gaseous and circular speeds ( among these only ngc 3898 belongs also to kent s sample ) .    without pretending to draw any statistical conclusion based on so small number of objects",
    ", it nevertheless seems probable that non - circular gas velocities could be a common feature in the central kiloparsec of disc galaxies ranging from s0 s to sb s .",
    "however , according to the available data , it is not possible to derive a straightforward correlation with the galaxy morphological type , total luminosity , bulge - to - disc mass ratio or bulge size .",
    "it seems that even if the gas may be supported by non - circular random motions , this type of dynamical - pressure support may not be the only effect for the ` slowly - rising ' gas rotation curves .",
    "in fact , the central gas velocity dispersion is too low to account for the difference between gas and circular speeds in two of the three galaxies ( namely ngc 2775 , and ngc 3898 ) shown in table [ tab : slowlyrising ] for which the gas velocity falls short of the circular speed and the velocity - dispersion profile of",
    "the gaseous component is available .",
    "dynamical modelling based both on stellar and gaseous kinematics of a larger number of bulge - dominated galaxies is needed to understand the links between slowly - rotating gas and bulge properties , as a first step to put constraints on its physical nature ( e.g. mathews 1990 ) and origin ( e.g. bertola et al . 1995 ) .",
