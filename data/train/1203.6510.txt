    "the detection of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 gauge bosons almost thirty years ago established that the electroweak interactions are successfully described by a @xmath5 gauge group spontaneously broken to @xmath6 .",
    "however , while the higgs mechanism is certainly at work , the precise way in which the electroweak symmetry is broken remains a mystery . even whether the underlying dynamics is weakly or strongly coupled remains unclear .",
    "the simplest option for the weakly - coupled scenario is the introduction of a fundamental scalar doublet . besides the required 3 goldstone bosons , one obtains a massive scalar field , the ( standard model ) higgs boson",
    ", whose mass has to be taken as a free parameter .",
    "fundamental scalar particles however lead to problems of naturalness , and in order to make the theory meaningful an additional stabilization mechanism has to be invoked .",
    "supersymmetry still stands as the most solid theoretical framework to explain the lightness of a weakly - coupled higgs .",
    "the alternative is a scenario with dynamical symmetry breaking . in this case spontaneous symmetry breaking",
    "is triggered by a condensate , which is generated by new interactions that become strongly coupled at the electroweak scale .",
    "this scenario is akin to how chiral symmetry is broken in qcd . therefore , one of the distinctive features of strongly - coupled scenarios is compositeness and the existence of a large number of bound states , naturally starting at the tev scale . in general ,",
    "strongly - coupled scenarios allow for the presence of a light scalar ( with mass around the electroweak scale ) if it is interpreted as a pseudo - goldstone boson of a spontaneously broken symmetry group  @xcite .",
    "the appeal of such models is that this ( composite ) higgs mass is naturally of the order of the electroweak scale  @xcite .",
    "the search for the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking is currently underway at the lhc . at the time of writing , atlas and cms",
    "have already excluded a light higgs boson for a wide range of masses .",
    "the non - excluded area is at present in the range 115 - 130 gev , with some intriguing excess around 125 gev , not significant enough to be conclusive  @xcite .",
    "however , even if the existence of a light higgs is confirmed , we will still be unable to discern whether weakly - coupled or strongly - coupled scenarios are at work .",
    "additional information at the tev scale will be needed .",
    "so far , no signals of tev particles , be it susy partners or bound states of strongly - coupled theories , have been observed .    in this article",
    "we will study strongly - coupled scenarios .",
    "in the past , starting with technicolor models , there has been a huge effort in model - building .",
    "however , finding a viable uv completion of a strongly - coupled scenario has proven a hard task , especially when it comes to match the low - energy experimental constraints from lep . in this paper",
    "we will follow a model - independent approach .",
    "the language we will use is that of effective field theories , with the only assumption that the low energy degrees of freedom reduce to the presently - established particle content of the standard model .",
    "we will show that such an effective theory is renormalizable order by order in a @xmath7 expansion ( @xmath8 tev ) , and will list the full set of operators up to next - to - leading order ( nlo ) .",
    "this might be considered the minimal version of an effective theory of strongly - coupled electroweak symmetry breaking , in the sense that we are including only three goldstone fields , _",
    "i.e. _ the longitudinal modes of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 gauge bosons .",
    "this approach to dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking was first studied in  @xcite , inspired by the methods developed for chiral symmetry breaking in the strong interactions  @xcite . over the years",
    "there have been different steps towards extending the work of @xcite , but a systematic classification of operators is still lacking .",
    "a first analysis of the nlo counterterms for the gauge boson and goldstone sectors was given in  @xcite , which was followed by a more systematic treatment of the operator basis in the cp - conserving  @xcite and cp - violating  @xcite sectors .",
    "the interactions of fermionic operators with goldstone modes were first considered in  @xcite , where the naive dimension-4 operators were listed .",
    "this list was soon enlarged to include also scalar and tensor currents  @xcite . in the absence of experimental constraints , the coefficients of the different operators",
    "were initially estimated with specific uv completions , most prominently technicolor - inspired models . with the advent of lep 1 and 2 ,",
    "several phenomenological analyses were devoted to constraining the electroweak chiral lagrangian with electroweak precision tests , mostly through oblique parameters and triple gauge boson couplings ( see , for instance , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the purpose of this work is twofold : first , we will clarify issues of power counting and provide a consistent framework for the electroweak effective theory .",
    "then we will present a comprehensive classification of operators to nlo in the @xmath7 expansion .",
    "while in the gauge boson sector the list of operators was settled long ago  @xcite , in the quark sector a systematic treatment is still needed .",
    "for instance , ref .",
    "@xcite considered fermion bilinears but dismissed operators proportional to the fermion masses , which is clearly not a suitable approximation for top quark physics .",
    "moreover , a full classification of 4-fermion operators has not been considered so far in the literature .",
    "finally , due care is paid to eliminate possible redundancies and to reduce the number of operators to a minimal basis . in particular , we show that some relations between operators with fermions and gauge bosons can be obtained by direct application of the equations of motion and integration by parts .",
    "those relations have already been pointed out in @xcite and can be of importance in the study of triple gauge boson couplings @xcite .",
    "as already mentioned , the framework we introduce in this article assumes a minimal particle content for the standard model . it would be interesting to consider extensions that include a ( composite ) light ( pseudo)scalar , if lhc eventually unveils its existence .",
    "these extensions would share some similarities with the setting presented in @xcite .",
    "the present article is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : lsmlo ] we review the leading order lagrangian for the electroweak interactions in the absence of a light fundamental higgs boson . the power counting for the effective theory is discussed in section  [ sec : pcount ] and then used in section  [ sec : lsmnlo ] to provide the full list of operators at next - to - leading order . as a simple illustration of",
    "how such operators can be generated from a uv - complete theory , in section  [ sec : smhh ] we consider as a toy model the standard model with a heavy higgs . in section  [ sec : smlh ] we contrast our basis of operators with the corresponding nlo operators in the presence of a light higgs boson .",
    "related issues of decoupling and renormalizability are discussed in section  [ sec : renorm ] .",
    "conclusions are given in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "the power - counting formulas are derived in appendix a. technical details on the construction of the operator basis at nlo are provided in appendix b , while appendix c lists the full set of operators in the unitary gauge .",
    "the field content of the standard model ( sm ) is specified by the left - handed doublets @xmath9 , @xmath10 and right - handed singlets @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 of quarks and leptons , together with the gauge fields @xmath14 , @xmath3 , @xmath15 of @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the fermion fields are @xmath19 with their transformation properties under @xmath20 and @xmath21 and their hypercharge @xmath22 indicated in brackets .",
    "each of the fields carries a generation index @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , which has been suppressed in ( [ ql ] ) .",
    "the effective theory of the gauge and fermion fields is constructed by writing down all possible lorentz - invariant operators , composed of these fields , that are singlets under the sm gauge group .",
    "restriction to operators of dimension less or equal to 4 uniquely determines the renormalizable , unbroken part of the sm lagrangian @xmath26 here and in the following the trace of a matrix @xmath27 is denoted by @xmath28 .",
    "the covariant derivative of a fermion field @xmath29 is defined as @xmath30 the fields are normalized in the canonical way and the fermionic terms can always be chosen to be diagonal in the generation index .",
    "we have not written the topological terms @xmath31 and @xmath32 . the effective lagrangian ( [ lsm4 ] ) describes physics at the electroweak scale @xmath33 , assumed to be small in comparison with a new physics scale @xmath34 .",
    "next , @xmath5 is spontaneously broken to the electromagnetic @xmath6 .",
    "the associated goldstone bosons can be described by the nonlinear @xmath21 matrix field @xmath35 with @xmath36 the generators of @xmath21 .",
    "we further suppose that no additional light fields exist , in particular no physical higgs boson . assuming that the goldstone bosons arise from the spontaneous breaking of a global @xmath37 symmetry to the diagonal subgroup @xmath38",
    ", the field @xmath39 transforms as @xmath40 the transformations @xmath41 and the @xmath18 subgroup of @xmath42 are gauged , so that the covariant derivative of @xmath39 is given by @xmath43 the dynamics of the goldstone bosons can be described in a model - independent way by constructing the most general lagrangian , built from @xmath39 and the remaining sm fields , that is consistent with the sm gauge symmetry . in practice this construction is carried out including all operators that contribute up to a given order in @xmath44 , where @xmath34 is the effective theory cutoff .",
    "this procedure is well - known from chiral perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "the systematics of this expansion has some peculiar features in the case of the electroweak standard model and will be discussed in detail in the next section .",
    "presently we summarize the terms to be included at lowest order in the lagrangian , that is , terms of the same order in @xmath44 as the renormalizable part in ( [ lsm4 ] ) .",
    "to lowest order the lagrangian describing the goldstone bosons and their interactions with the sm fields is given by @xmath45 where the right - handed quark and lepton fields are collected in @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively .",
    "as before , we do not write generation indices explicitly .",
    "the yukawa matrices @xmath48 are understood to denote the usual matrices in generation space .",
    "we define @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 will be needed below .",
    "the first expression in ( [ lulo ] ) is the leading term , of @xmath52 , in chiral perturbation theory .",
    "it contains the kinetic term of the goldstone fields and the mass term of the weak gauge bosons .",
    "it is therefore of the same size @xmath53 as the terms in ( [ lsm4 ] ) and has to be counted as a leading order contribution . in principle , all terms of @xmath52 that are invariant under the sm gauge group @xmath5 have to be included in the effective theory at lowest order .",
    "there are only two such terms , the first operator in ( [ lulo ] ) and @xmath54 in contrast to the first term in ( [ lulo ] ) , the operator in ( [ lub1 ] ) does not respect the global custodial @xmath37 symmetry @xcite .",
    "it contributes to the electroweak @xmath55-parameter @xcite , which is strongly restricted by experimental data .",
    "this implies that the coefficient @xmath56 is constrained to be very small ( @xmath57 ) and suggests that the custodial symmetry is largely respected by the underlying dynamics of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "if this is the case , the operator ( [ lub1 ] ) can in general still be induced through loop corrections .",
    "then @xmath58 and the contribution in ( [ lub1 ] ) amounts to a next - to - leading order correction .",
    "the related power - counting will be discussed in detail in section [ sec : pcount ] .",
    "we have listed this term here for completeness .",
    "the last term in ( [ lulo ] ) gives masses to the sm fermions .",
    "motivated by the case of the top quark , we will count the yukawa couplings @xmath59 as order one .",
    "the fermion mass term then contributes at the same order as the previous terms .",
    "the operators in this term are the most general expressions built from fermion bilinears and @xmath39 fields without derivatives .",
    "the lagrangian @xmath60 thus defines the leading order of the effective theory for the minimal standard model without a light higgs boson .    at the quantum level",
    ", the previous list of leading order operators has to be supplemented with the usual gauge - fixing and faddeev - popov terms .",
    "expressions for both of these terms in the covariant @xmath61 gauges are given in  @xcite .",
    "in this paper , following  @xcite , we will work in the landau gauge .",
    "the main advantage of the landau gauge for the electroweak effective theory we are considering is that ghost and goldstone fields decouple . as a result",
    ", there is no need to include ghosts in the effective operator basis : only goldstones coupled to gauge and fermion fields are needed to renormalize the divergences of the leading - order lagrangian of eq .",
    "( [ lulo ] ) . additionally , because of this decoupling , the ghost term in landau gauge is exactly the one of the standard model .",
    "therefore , the presence of the conventional faddeev - popov term should be implicitly understood in eq .",
    "( [ lulo ] ) .",
    "in this section we discuss the systematics of the expansion that defines the effective theory .",
    "this expansion can not be simply organized in terms of the dimension of operators alone .",
    "this is clear from the lagrangian @xmath60 in ( [ lsm4 ] ) and ( [ lulo ] ) , which contains operators of dimension 2 , 3 and 4 , all contributing at leading order . also ,",
    "while ( [ lsm4 ] ) is renormalizable , ( [ lulo ] ) contains interactions that are non - renormalizable ( in the traditional sense ) .",
    "such a theory can still be renormalized ( in the modern sense ) , order by order in a loop expansion , at the expense of introducing at each order a finite number of new counterterms , whose structure is dictated by symmetry .",
    "a similar discussion has been given previously in the context of the chiral quark model in @xcite .",
    "it will be our goal to construct the complete next - to - leading order lagrangian supplementing the leading order terms in @xmath60 .",
    "the next - to - leading order is understood here to include all operators , allowed by the relevant symmetries , with coefficients of order @xmath2 ( or @xmath62 ) .",
    "a minimal set of operators is defined by the terms required to absorb the ultraviolet divergences generated at one loop by the lowest order lagrangian @xmath60 .    as an example",
    ", we may consider the terms in the lagrangian ( [ lulo ] ) , which induce at one loop the diagram for @xmath63 scattering shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pcexmp ] .",
    "each vertex @xmath64 has a factor of @xmath65 , with @xmath66 a generic yukawa coupling .",
    "the loop integration produces a factor of @xmath67 , and the four powers of loop momentum @xmath68 in the numerator are compensated by the four powers of @xmath68 from the two boson propagators .",
    "this leads to the following schematic expression for the diagram @xmath69 this result indicates a 4-fermion amplitude with a logarithmic divergence by power counting .",
    "the amplitude matches onto a local , gauge - invariant , dimension-6 operator @xmath70 , whose coefficient will absorb the ultraviolet divergence .",
    "we see that this new operator appears with a natural suppression of order @xmath7 .",
    "it is therefore part of the next - to - leading order lagrangian we want to construct .",
    "the example we have just discussed can be generalized .",
    "let us in a first step restrict our attention to the goldstone - fermion sector , neglecting the gauge fields .",
    "this corresponds to taking the leading order lagrangian @xmath60 in the gaugeless limit ( @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 ) . in this case",
    "the interaction vertices are either couplings of an even number @xmath74 of goldstone bosons with two powers of momentum , contributing a factor of @xmath75 , or couplings of @xmath76 ( and @xmath77 ) to an arbitrary number @xmath78 of bosons , contributing a factor of @xmath79 . considering a general diagram @xmath80 with these leading - order vertices , but with any number of loops @xmath81 and an arbitrary number of external lines , we find the power counting formula @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the number of external fermions @xmath29 , @xmath15 is the number of external goldstone bosons @xmath84 and @xmath85 is the total number of yukawa vertices , with @xmath86 the number of such vertices that have @xmath78 boson lines .",

    "to find the required counterterms we proceed as before .",
    "the order in the expansion in @xmath7 is again determined by @xmath81 .",
    "a non - negative power of @xmath68 signals a divergent diagram . at the same time it gives the number of derivatives in the local operator that is needed to absorb the divergence .",

    "we will not provide a complete classification of those operators , but we would like to comment on a few relevant aspects .",
    "to some extent the actual size of the coefficient of a given operator depends on the uv completion of the theory .",

    "a similar consideration applies to the operators @xmath169 and @xmath189 , which are typically loop induced @xcite .",
    "the nnlo classes @xmath169 and @xmath189 are special in that they directly correspond to dimension-6 operators appearing at nlo in the conventional standard model with a linear higgs doublet .",

    "as we have seen above , 4-fermion operators of the form @xmath195 arise as counterterms at next - to - leading order in the effective lagrangian and thus have to be included in our operator basis .",
    "we are thus led to consider the entire class of 4-fermion operators , which may include an arbitrary number of @xmath39 fields .",
    "however , not all of these operators are required as counterterms of the lagrangian @xmath60 at next - to - leading order .",
    "an example is the case of @xmath196 , whose one - loop coefficient is finite by power counting ( @xmath197 , @xmath198 in ( [ ctcond ] ) ) .",
    "it is then natural to expect this term only at nnlo @xmath184 .",

    "in the following section we would like to illustrate how the nonlinear effective lagrangian of electroweak interactions , including next - to - leading order terms , arises in the context of a specific model . for this purpose",

    "the higgs sector of the renormalizable standard model can be written as @xmath297 where the ordinary higgs doublet , written in matrix notation @xmath298 , has been parametrized as ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath299 here @xmath39 is the @xmath21 matrix field defined in ( [ uudef ] ) and @xmath300 is the higgs boson , which transforms as a singlet under the sm gauge group . with ( [ hhu ] )",

    "subleading terms in this lagrangian are generated when corrections from virtual @xmath300 are taken into account . keeping only the effects of single tree - level exchange of the heavy higgs particle , the next - to - leading order terms read @xmath307 the lagrangian @xmath308 arises from the terms @xmath309 in ( [ lhhj ] ) upon completing the square when integrating out @xmath300 in the path integral .",

    "the next - to - leading operators in ( [ lhheff ] ) are a subset of the complete basis listed in section [ sec : lsmnlo ] .",
    "they illustrate how operators of different canonical dimension emerge at a given order of the effective lagrangian . in particular , operators of dimension 4 , 5 and 6 are present in ( [ lhheff ] ) .",
    "specifically , the following terms out of the basis of nlo operators appear : the pure @xmath39-field operator @xmath313 , the fermion bilinear operators @xmath314 , @xmath315 , @xmath316 , and their hermitian conjugates , as well as all 4-fermion operators coming from the square of the yukawa terms . up to hermitian conjugates , there are 12 such 4-fermion operators , which are given by @xmath317 together with @xmath318",
    "in the conventional standard model with a physical higgs field the next - to - leading order corrections to the renormalizable part are given by dimension-6 operators in the effective lagrangian ( up to the single dimension-5 operator that generates majorana masses for neutrinos given in ( [ lvdim5 ] ) ) .",
    "the list of these operators has been compiled by buchmller and wyler in @xcite .",
    "it has recently been revised and updated in a new systematic study by grzadkowski et al .",
    "@xcite . in this section",
    "we show how the complete list of operators in @xcite can be reproduced from the next - to - leading operators in our effective theory .",
    "we have checked the contents of @xcite and fully agree with the results of this paper .",
    "the matrix @xmath298 , where @xmath319 is the linearly transforming higgs field , transforms in the same way as the goldstone field @xmath39 .",
    "we may therefore replace @xmath320 in the operators of the nonlinear theory without affecting the required transformation properties , gauge invariance in particular .",
    "however , introducing the linear field @xmath321 implies two important differences with respect to the nonlinear version based on @xmath39 .",
    "first , we no longer have the constraint @xmath322 , so that factors of @xmath323 can now appear as independent variables in the lagrangian ( note however that @xmath324 ) .",
    "second , since the lowest - order lagrangian becomes renormalizable with the transition to the linear higgs field , the new - physics scale @xmath34 may be taken to decouple from the electroweak scale , @xmath325 .",
    "therefore , the field @xmath321 enters the power counting with its canonical dimension @xmath326 .",
    "the ordering of terms in the effective lagrangian is then governed by dimensional counting alone .",
    "for example , at lowest order , where @xmath327 from ( [ lsm4 ] ) and ( [ lulo ] ) , one has to substitute @xmath328 and add the invariants @xmath323 and @xmath329 to recover all terms up to dimension 4 of the renormalizable standard model .",
    "note that with the replacement @xmath328 the custodial symmetry breaking term in ( [ lub1 ] ) becomes an operator of dimension 6 .    applying this reasoning to the next - to - leading - order terms based on the nonlinear theory",
    ", we first have to include additional operators that involve the invariant @xmath330 .",
    "these are easily enumerated at the dimension-6 level .",
    "the first possibility is the ( unique ) operator with six factors of @xmath319 , @xmath331 ( class @xmath332 in @xcite ) .",
    "next we have @xmath333 in combination with a dimension-2 operator , which can only be @xmath334 .",
    "this gives the operator @xmath335 ( class @xmath336 in @xcite ) , which is unique up to total derivatives .",
    "finally , one may write down the operators with a single factor of @xmath337 , multiplied by any gauge invariant operator of dimension 4 . the candidates for the latter",
    "are just the terms in the leading - order renormalizable lagrangian .",
    "this gives immediately the three operators @xmath338 corresponding to the yukawa terms ( class @xmath339 in @xcite ) .",
    "similarly one has @xmath340 and @xmath341 for the gauge fields @xmath342 , @xmath3 , @xmath15 ( class @xmath343 in @xcite ) .",
    "no new operators arise from the higgs - potential terms @xmath344 and @xmath333 , nor from the fermion kinetic terms @xmath345 , where the leading - order equations of motion can be applied to reduce @xmath346 to structures already listed above . for the only remaining possibility we have , using equations of motion and integration by parts , @xcite @xmath347 the operator on the right is the term in class @xmath336 mentioned before and the ellipsis denotes total derivatives and further operators already encountered above .",
    "if the higgs boson kinetic term is written differently , we would have @xmath348 , which is again not independent upon using the equations of motion . in total , therefore , one finds 11 operators involving factors of @xmath337 .",
    "next , there are the operators of dimension 6 that do not include any factor of @xmath39 and which are thus identical in the nonlinear and in the linear theory .",
    "these are the 4-fermion operators without @xmath39 fields ( @xmath225 ) and the operators with three factors of field - strength tensors ( @xmath165 ) .",
    "a further class of operators are the terms in the nonlinear theory that become operators of dimension larger than 6 upon replacing @xmath320 .",
    "they are therefore absent in the linear higgs theory at order @xmath7 .",
    "the operators of this type are those in our classes @xmath96 , @xmath349 and @xmath111 .",
    "this leaves the cases @xmath161 , @xmath152 , @xmath212 and @xmath169 of next - to - leading operators in the nonlinear theory , as well as the operator in ( [ lub1 ] ) .",
    "they translate into dimension-6 operators of the standard model when @xmath350 , as described in the following .",
    "the custodial - symmetry breaking operator in ( [ lub1 ] ) becomes , up to a total divergence , @xmath351 the first term on the right has already been listed above .",
    "the second term is the remaining operator of class @xmath336 in @xcite .",
    "inspection of ( [ xudev ] ) and ( [ xudod ] ) shows that most of the operators in our classes @xmath161 and @xmath152 translate into operators of dimension higher than 6 .",
    "the exceptions are @xmath352 and the analogous term where @xmath353 .",
    "these two operators complete class @xmath343 in @xcite .    among the operators of class @xmath109 in ( [ psi2d ] ) ,",
    "some contain four factors of @xmath39-fields and become operators of dimension 8 when we replace @xmath320 .",
    "the remaining structures reduce to the eight dimension-6 operators in class @xmath354 of @xcite : @xmath355 @xmath356 @xmath357 finally , since @xmath358 the eight operators in our class @xmath169 ( [ psi2x ] ) reduce to the operators in class @xmath359 of @xcite .",
    "this completes the demonstration of how the full basis of dimension-6 operators given in @xcite can be recovered from the next - to - leading order terms in the nonlinear higgs model .",
    "a comprehensive discussion of renormalization of the effective theory is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "we limit ourselves to a particular example , which should serve to illustrate the essential features of renormalization at next - to - leading order in the electroweak chiral lagrangian .",
    "consider the amplitude for @xmath360 scattering , taking the gaugeless limit for simplicity .",

    "the leading logarithmic approximation will not be accurate .",
    "similar considerations have been given in @xcite .",
    "in this article we have studied an effective field theory ( eft ) description of the standard model assuming that the mechanism for spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking is triggered by strong dynamics at the tev scale .",
    "the resulting theory contains the fields of the standard model but , instead of describing electroweak symmetry breaking by introducing a higgs doublet ( linear sigma model ) , one uses a nonlinear realization for the goldstone modes .",
    "this article focusses mainly on clarifying the systematics of such an approach : in particular , we discuss in detail the power - counting of the @xmath44 expansion , providing the formulae needed to determine the complete list of nlo operators .",
    "this list is presented in landau gauge and , for phenomenological convenience , also in unitary gauge . at nlo",
    "there are 11 operators without fermion fields , 25 operators involving fermion bilinears and 64 four - quark operators .",
    "it is worth recalling that not all of the previous operators are required as counterterms of our effective field theory . while in some cases",
    "it is relatively easy to identify them , a general and systematic identification of the counterterms would require to carry out the full renormalization program for the lo operators , something that lies beyond the scope of the present article .",

    "this is an additional motivation to study the phenomenology associated with our eft basis of operators , especially in electroweak precision observables but also in top - quark physics .",
    "finally , it is worth stressing that the approach undertaken in this article assumes the minimal content of standard model fields : the electroweak symmetry breaking sector is characterized only by three goldstone bosons , which are the longitudinal modes of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 gauge bosons .",
