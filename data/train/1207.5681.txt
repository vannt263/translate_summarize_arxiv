    "the @xmath2 cold dark matter ( @xmath2cdm ) model has been proved to be successful in reproducing structure formation on large scales . in the standard paradigm , a nearly scale invariant power spectrum describes the cosmological primordial density fluctuations . if dm is collisionless , the clustering of substructure is scale - invariant down to the free - streaming scale of the cdm particle ( e.g. , @xcite  @xcite ; @xcite  @xcite ) .",
    "the properties of the subhalos in milky way size galaxies have been studied by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite through collisionless dm simulations .",
    "they found that @xmath3% of their mass reside in @xmath4 subhalos with masses in the range of @xmath5 , following a cdm subhalo - mass function @xmath6 .    at scales of dwarf satellite galaxies ,",
    "a comparison between the model predictions and observations is limited by our poor understanding of the baryonic processes involved in the formation of galaxies .",
    "for instance , supernova feedback and gas heating from cosmic sources can alleviate the inconsistency between the observed number of satellite galaxies in the milky way halo and the much higher number of subhalos predicted using @xmath7-body @xmath2cdm simulations @xcite . in this model , many satellites are either too faint to be detected in surveys or dark matter subhalos devoid of a baryonic counterpart @xcite .",
    "some observational consequences of the existence of substructure within galactic halos have been studied in the literature .",
    "@xcite suggested that long - lived stellar bars can be triggered by a tide from a massive subhalo .",
    "@xcite explored the idea that the interaction of dark matter subhalos with the gaseous disks of galaxies may generate density enhancements in the gas .",
    "@xcite studied the distribution of carbon stars in the stream of the sagittarius ( sgr ) dwarf galaxy and found that the sgr debris is more strongly scattered than would be expected if it would be orbiting in a smooth ( and thus non - substructured ) dm halo , but that is entirely consistent with perturbations by the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) alone . in this line of research",
    ", @xcite modeled the interaction between streams and halo clumps and concluded that stellar streams older than @xmath8  gyr can not survive in the presence of subhalos with the masses and numbers predicted by the @xmath2cdm model .",
    "nevertheless , the density variations in the star stream detected around the globular cluster palomar 5 and in the galaxy m31 appear to be in agreement with the existence of dm subhalos @xcite .",
    "the presence of dark - matter subhalos in dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( dsph ) might have observable consequences and may shed light on the nature of dm particles .",
    "for instance , @xcite and @xcite suggested that compact massive dark objects in the halo of dsph galaxies could resolve some long - standing problems in these systems . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite used analytical and @xmath7-body methods to examine the survival of wide stellar binaries against encounters with dark subhalos orbiting in the dm halos of dwarf galaxies .",
    "they found that a large fraction of wide binaries can be wiped out due to tidal encounters with these dark substructures .",
    "the observations of large separation binaries would impose a strong test to the putative substructure in halos of dwarf galaxies .",
    "also @xcite studied the gravitational scattering effects caused by subhalos on the phase - space distribution of dm particles in main halos .",
    "their numerical experiments indicate that the number and the mass density of subhalos could be high enough to flatten the main halo s inner cusp within a few dynamical times . in this work",
    ", we will focus on dsph galaxy ursa minor ( umi ) .",
    "umi has the peculiarity of showing a second stellar density peak ( or clump ) which is believed to be a cold long - lived structure @xcite .",
    "this clump has survived because the underlying gravitational potential in umi must be close to harmonic , which can be accomplished if the density profile of the dark halo has a large core @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xcite established stringent constraints on the mass and abundance of compact objects in umi in order to preserve the integrity of cold small - scale clumps seen in some dsph galaxies . in the present work ,",
    "our aim is to test whether or not the putative subhalos with a mass spectrum as that found in collisionless cdm is consistent with the stellar clump found in umi .",
    "our work may shed light on the mechanism responsible for the formation of cores in dwarf galaxies because some of them predict dissolution of dark - matter substructures below a scale of @xmath9 kpc .",
    "in fact , the core - making mechanisms proposed so far fall in three broad categories : supernova feedback ( e.g. , mo & mao 2004 ; mashchenko et al .",
    "2006 ; governato et al .",
    "2010 , 2012 ; pontzen & governato 2012 ; macci et al .",
    "2012 ) , dynamical friction from infalling baryonic clumps ( el - zant et al .",
    "2001 ; romano - daz et al .",
    "2009 ; goerdt et al .  2010 ) , or a change in any of the basic properties of dark matter particles [ e.g. , collisional , annihilating , decaying or warm dark matter ] ( spergel & steinhardt 2000 ; kaplinghat , knox & turner 2000 ; cen 2000 ; snchez - salcedo 2003 ; vila - reese et al .",
    "models in the latter category are expected to help erase dark - matter subhalos in dwarf galaxies , e.g. , by mass stripping if dark matter is collisional or by suppression of the power in the mass spectrum at small scales if dark matter is warm , whereas models in the first two categories are expected to preserve them .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in  [ sec : umi ] we describe some properties of umi and its clump .",
    "the initial conditions for our @xmath7-body simulations are described in  [ sec : dark ] .",
    "the results of the simulations are shown in ",
    "[ sec : results ] . finally , we present our conclusions in  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "umi is a dsph galaxy satellite of the milky way , located at a galactocentric distance of @xmath10  kpc @xcite .",
    "dynamical studies suggest that umi has a mass - to - light ratio larger than @xmath11 ( e.g.  @xcite  @xcite ) .",
    "rescaling the results of @xcite and taking a luminosity of @xmath12 @xcite , the total mass within @xmath13  kpc is @xmath14 , which results in a mass - to - light ratio @xmath15 for umi .",
    "it has to be noted that if we take @xmath16 @xcite then we obtain a @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "deeper data for dwarf galaxies often reveal a larger angular extent of their stellar component ( e. g. , @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) ; nevertheless , we adopt the lower luminosity value for umi .",
    "the high value of @xmath18 in umi implies that it is one of the most dark matter dominated dsph galaxies in the local group .",
    "umi s stellar king core radius along the semimajor axis is 17.9 arcmin ( @xmath19  kpc ) @xcite .",
    "umi shows a large ellipticity in the shape of the inner isodensity contours of the surface density of stars ( @xmath20 ) @xcite , but the most remarkable feature in umi s structure is the second off - centered density peak @xcite .",
    "one of these two peaks is located on the north - eastern side of the major axis of umi at a distance of @xmath21 kpc from umi s center .",
    "the radial velocity distribution of the stars in umi is well fitted by two gaussians , one representing the underlying background ( @xmath22  km s@xmath23 ) and the other representing the velocity dispersion of the second peak ( @xmath24  km  s@xmath23 ) .",
    "the stars in the vicinity of this peak comprise a kinematically distinct cold subpopulation : a dynamically cold stellar clump .",
    "the most appealing interpretation of umi s clump is that it is a disrupted cluster @xcite that orbits in the plane of the sky , and that has survived in phase - space because the underlying gravitational potential is harmonic @xcite .",
    "this implies that the dark halo density profile in umi should have a core ( and not a cuspy profile as predicted by the @xmath2cdm paradigm ) and that this core must be large ( @xmath25  pc , see @xcite  @xcite and @xcite  @xcite ) .",
    "the stellar population of the umi dwarf galaxy is very old with an age of @xmath3@xmath26 gyr ; virtually all the stars were formed @xmath3  gyr ago , and 90% of them were formed @xmath26  gyr ago @xcite .",
    "this implies that star formation was halted at a redshift of @xmath27 , probably because supernova explosions were able to remove all the gas .",
    "in fact , deep observations have not detected gas in umi @xcite . gas replenishment from dying stars and stellar winds",
    "is expected to be very small .",
    "if the gas returned to the interstellar medium by intermediate- and low - mass dying stars were distributed across the galaxy as the stars are , the central gas density would reach a value of @xmath28  pc@xmath29 after @xmath3  gyr @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to a particle density of @xmath30  cm@xmath29 , much smaller that the typical lower thresholds for star - forming regions ( @xmath32  cm@xmath29 ) @xcite .",
    "since we are interested here in the dynamical evolution of the stellar clump over the last @xmath3 gyr , once essentially all the gas has been removed , we can discard both gas processes and stellar evolution in our simulations .",
    "we performed @xmath7-body simulations of the umi dsph galaxy , which include a baryonic component ( the bulk stellar component and the stellar clump ) embedded in a spherical ( live ) dark matter halo .",
    "the dark matter halo density profile selected is defined as @xmath33^{(\\beta-\\gamma/\\alpha ) } }   \\mbox {    .}\\ ] ] here @xmath34 accounts for the central density in the case of @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the scale length . a nfw profile @xcite is obtained for ( @xmath37)=(@xmath38 ) .",
    "we have chosen the values ( @xmath37)=(@xmath39 ) in order to have a cored dm mass density profile .",
    "it has been found that cored profiles ( and not cuspy profiles ) are in better agreement with umi dynamics @xcite .",
    "some other dsph galaxies in the local group such as fornax , sculptor , carina , leo i and leo ii are also believed to possess cored dark halos instead of cuspy profiles @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is found from high resolution observations of the rotation curves for dm dominated low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies that dm halos have density profiles compatible with flat central cores @xcite .",
    "we explored two different cored halos ; a small - core halo with a scale length of @xmath40  kpc ( which corresponds to a core radius of @xmath21  kpc ) with a total mass of @xmath41 , and a big - core halo with a scale length of @xmath42  kpc ( core radius @xmath43  kpc ) and a total mass of @xmath44 . for our halo models we have a mass within a radius of @xmath45  kpc ( the clump s orbit ) of @xmath46 for the small - core halo , and a mass of @xmath47 for the big - core halo model .",
    "this is consistent with the results of @xcite ( 2007 , 2008 ) who considered dark halos compatible with the observed stellar kinematics of the classical dsph galaxies , including the dwarf galaxy umi .",
    "they found that , for realistic density profiles , the mass interior to @xmath48 pc is @xmath49 for all dsph galaxies in the milky way halo .    to generate the initial conditions of the dark matter particles of the smooth background distribution , we used the distribution function proposed by @xcite , and the velocity dispersion of the system was taken to be isotropic .    in order to explore the dynamical effects of a clumpy halo , we generated the mass spectrum of substructures in the halo following the power - law mass distribution @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "the values of @xmath51 and @xmath52 are fixed once the lower @xmath53 and upper @xmath54 mass limits of the substructure particles and the fraction ( @xmath55 ) of the halo mass comprised in substructures , are given .",
    "the mass of dark matter particles used in our simulations without subhalos is @xmath56 , which corresponds to our maximal mass resolution for the halo particles .",
    "then it is a natural choice to take @xmath57 as the lower mass limit . adopting the subhalo mass function found in cdm simulations ,",
    "the subhalos are expected to have masses up to @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the virial mass of the halo @xcite .",
    "given that the estimated average virial mass of the dsph galaxies is of the order of @xmath60 @xcite , the upper mass limit could be as large as @xmath61 .",
    "it then becomes reasonable to take the generous upper mass limit as @xmath62 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : substructure ] ) with @xmath55 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 known , determines the number @xmath63 of substructure particles . in order to construct a clumpy dm halo",
    ", we choose from the original smooth dm halo , a number @xmath63 of random particles and replace their masses according to the power - law in equation ( [ eq : substructure ] ) .",
    "the spatial stellar density profiles of elliptical systems are commonly described as a power law in radius @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the total stellar mass and @xmath66 is the scale radius . for @xmath67 ,",
    "these models have simple analytic properties and are called dehnen models ( @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) . in these models",
    "the densities are proportional to @xmath68 at large radii and diverge in the center as @xmath69 . to model the bulk stellar component in umi we used a dehnen model @xcite where @xmath70 .",
    "this slope most closely resembles the de vaucouleurs model in surface density .",
    "we took the scale radius for the underlying stellar component in the umi galaxy to be @xmath71  kpc @xcite .",
    "we set the total mass of the stellar component to be @xmath72 taking the typical value of the mass - to - light ratio @xmath73 .",
    "we performed an @xmath7-body simulation with the dm halo and the underlying stellar components together .",
    "the resulting system was found to be stationary for a hubble time ( i.e. the density profile of the stellar component and the velocity dispersion stayed approximately constant for a hubble time ) .",
    "the stellar velocity dispersion ( @xmath74  km  s@xmath23 ) was in agreement with the velocity dispersion of the stellar component found in umi ( @xmath75  km s@xmath23 ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) .    finally , for the initial density profile of the stellar clump , we take @xmath76 with the clump radius @xmath77 between @xmath78  pc and @xmath79  pc ( @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "the clump s velocity dispersion was set to @xmath80  km s@xmath23 .",
    "the clump was dropped at a galactocentric distance of @xmath45  kpc in a circular orbit in the @xmath81 plane ( see also @xcite @xcite ) . since the clump s stars have the same color as the underlying stellar population in umi @xcite , we assume that the @xmath82-band mass - to - light ratio @xmath83 of the clump is the same as it is for the underlying stellar component ( say , @xmath73 ) .",
    "thus , the mass of the clump @xmath84 is @xmath85 .",
    "since the internal two - body relaxation timescales for the three components ( clump , underlying stellar component and halo ) are much larger than one hubble time , this system can be represented as collisionless @xcite .",
    "we simulated the evolution of the umi dwarf galaxy ( stellar clump , underlying stellar component and dm halo ) using the @xmath7-body code @xcite .",
    "is a highly efficient particle - mesh , collisionless - dynamics code with high resolution sub - grids .",
    "the parameters of each model are given in table [ tab : resultados1 ] . in our case , uses three nested grids centered in the center of density of the umi dsph galaxy .",
    "we used @xmath86 cubic cells for each of the grids .",
    "the inner grid is meant to resolve the inner region of umi and the outer grid ( with a radii of @xmath87  kpc for all cases ) resolves the stars that are stripped away from umi s potential .",
    "the spatial resolution is determined by the number of grid cells per dimension ( @xmath88 ) and the grid radius ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "then the side length of one grid cell is defined as @xmath90 . to study the convergence of the results with different resolutions",
    ", we performed three simulations : a simulation with @xmath86 cubic cells , one with higher ( @xmath91 cubic cells ) and one with lower ( @xmath92 cubic cells ) resolution of model @xmath93 ( see model parameters in table [ tab : resultados1 ] ) .",
    "we obtained practically the same results for the three resolutions .",
    "we conclude that @xmath86 cubic cells suffices to achieve a robust accuracy . for @xmath94 , the resolution , which is of the order of the typical distance between the particles in the simulation ,",
    "is given at the two last columns of table [ tab : code ] .",
    "integrates the equations of motion with a leap - frog algorithm , and a constant time step @xmath95 .",
    "we selected a time step of @xmath96  myr in our simulations in order to guarantee that the energy ( for the isolated components ) is conserved better than @xmath97 .",
    "the properties of the three modeled components of umi ( dm halo , underlying stellar component and stellar clump ) used in the simulation are shown in table [ tab : code ] . also , the radii of the inner , middle and outer grids for each of the components are given .",
    "our @xmath7-body simulations were carried out from a time @xmath98 to @xmath99  gyr using the code described in section [ sec : code ] . in table [ tab : resultados1 ] we list the parameters used in the simulations ( see also  [ sec : barion ] ) . for the models @xmath100 ( small - core halo ) we used @xmath101 particles to represent the halo component , @xmath102 particles for the bulk stellar component , and @xmath103 particles for the stellar clump . for the models @xmath104 ( big core halo ) we used the same particle number mentioned before for the underlying stellar component and for the stellar clump , but we used @xmath105 particles for the halo component .",

    "the destruction times for both clumps in the small - core case are @xmath125 and @xmath126  gyr for @xmath111  pc and @xmath112  pc , respectively ( see last column of table  [ tab : resultados1 ] ) .",
    "this implies that a halo core of @xmath19  kpc is not large enough to guarantee the survival of the clump .",

    "it remains to study a more realistic scenario where the subhalos are not point particles ( in which case resembles more the case of vmos ) but are extended perturbers",
    ". it would be worthwhile to quantify the effect that these extended subhalos would imprint compared to the point mass case studied here , and see in a more general case if subhalos in dsph galaxies impose a strong test to the @xmath2cdm scenario .",
    "preliminary simulations suggest that the disruption timescale of the clump increases by @xmath177@xmath178 if subhalos are extended , which is not enough to account for the survival of the clump . a thorough study will be presented elsewhere .",
