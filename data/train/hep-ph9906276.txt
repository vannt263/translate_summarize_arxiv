    "non - singlet structure functions , i.e. flavour - dependent contributions to the deep inelastic structure functions , have been the object of intensive theoretical investigation . besides being interesting in themselves ,",
    "they are also comparatively technically simple for analysis , and can be regarded as a starting ground for a theoretical description of dis structure functions .",
    "the standard and the most widespread way for theoretical investigation of dis structure functions is the dglap evolution equations @xcite .",
    "as is well known , in the description of dis , these equations provide also good agreement with experimental data @xcite when they are used in the small- @xmath0 region , although they are not expected to work very well in this kinematical region . actually , in the small-@xmath0 region",
    ", a regge - type behaviour for the dis structure functions can not be obtained from dglap , which predicts instead a dependence of the type @xmath2 . in perturbative qcd , such regge - like behaviour",
    "was obtained @xcite a long time ago for structure functions of unpolarized dis and recently @xcite for structure functions of the polarized dis . however , all those results are obtained in the leading logarithmic approximation , which has the unsatisfactory feature that @xmath1 is regarded as a constant .    in the present paper in addition to providing formulae for the asymptotics of the non - singlet structure function at very small @xmath0 , we present also an explicit expression for @xmath3 for small but finite values of @xmath0 , which accounts for both leading ( double - logarithmic ) and subleading ( single - logarithmic ) contributions to all orders in qcd coupling , including running @xmath1 effects . as logarithms of @xmath0 and of @xmath4 are important at small @xmath0 , we account for them both . in order to take running @xmath1 effects into account , we use in the present work the approach of @xcite , with some important changes .",
    "earlier , the running @xmath1 effects were incorporated into the double - logarithmic equations for the non - singlet structure function at small @xmath0 in @xcite , but other single logarithmic contributions were not taken into account in those works . in the present work we take them into account , which makes our approach self - consistent .    in the dglap equations ,",
    "the expressions for the anomalous dimensions take into account a finite number of nlo contributions ; in this approach , the qcd coupling depends on @xmath4 .",
    "after the total resummation of the singular nlo contributions to the anomalous dimensions with the double logarithmic accuracy performed in @xcite , there appeared works on the small-@xmath0 behaviour of the structure functions combining , to a certain extent , the results of the dglap with the results of @xcite .",
    "in particular , the works @xcite treat the running qcd coupling at small @xmath0 , allowing @xmath1 to depend on the incoming photon virtuality @xmath4 .",
    "we arrive at a different conclusion .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "2 we derive the small-@xmath0 evolution equations for @xmath3 and solve them . in sect .",
    "3 we obtain the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath3 and discuss it . finally , sect .",
    "4 contains our conclusions .",
    "in the born approximation , and suppressing unimportant factors , we define the non - singlet structure function as    @xmath5    for the radiative corrections to the born approximation in the kinematical region of small @xmath0 and large @xmath4 , both logarithms of @xmath4 and of @xmath0 are essential and should be taken into account .",
    "therefore , a two - dimensional evolution equation is needed for @xmath3 , combining the evolution with respect to both @xmath0 and @xmath4 .",
    "it is simpler to obtain such an equation for the scattering amplitude @xmath6 , with the @xmath7-channel discontinuity ( imaginary part ) proportional to @xmath3 :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the mandelstam variable corresponding to the squared total energy of the process under discussion . in the born approximation ,",
    "@xmath10 is represented by the two graphs in fig.[born ] , although only graph ( a ) has a non - zero imaginary part in @xmath7 and therefore only that graph contributes to @xmath3 .",
    "this is the reason why there is no difference in the born approximation between the non - singlet contributions to the spin- dependent and to the spin - independent structure functions .",
    "graphs contributing to @xmath10 at higher orders in @xmath1 are obtained from both graphs in fig.[born ] , by adding to them gluon propagators and quark and gluon loops .",
    "starting from the order @xmath11 , the graphs obtained from fig.[born]b , with non - ladder gluon propagators incorporated , contribute in different ways to the non - singlet components of the spin - dependent and the spin - independent structure functions ( see @xcite ) . in the present paper",
    "we consider the non - singlet contribution to the spin - independet structure functions @xmath12 and @xmath13 . in terms of the regge theory",
    "we consider the positive signature contribution to @xmath3 . the first - loop correction to the born graph ( a ) in fig.[born ]",
    "is represented by graphs in fig.[first ] .",
    "having chosen the planar gauge    @xmath14    for the virtual gluon , we make the total contribution of all three graphs in fig.[first ] to be concentrated in the single graph ( a ) . iterating this graph",
    ", we obtain all graphs ( of the ladder type only ) contributing to @xmath3 . in order to avoid the infrared ( ir ) singularities that appear in the radiative corrections , we use lipatov s prescription of compactifying the impact parameter space ( see e.g. @xcite ) , in other words , we introduce the infrared cut - off @xmath15 in the transverse space ( with respect to the plane formed by @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) when integrating over the momenta of virtual particles . with such a cut - off acting as a mass scale , one can neglect quark masses and still be free from ir singularities . until now",
    "the procedure is not different from the one used in the dglap , apart from the infrared regularization , which is a purely technical issue .",
    "the main difference comes when specifying the limits of integration over the transverse momenta of virtual particles . in the dglap , all",
    "ladder transverse momenta @xmath18 are ordered as    @xmath19    with the numeration running from the bottom of the ladder to the top .",
    "+ equation ( [ order ] ) shows that only the integration over @xmath20 has @xmath15 as the lower limit .",
    "the lower limits for other @xmath21 with @xmath22 are expressed through the transverse momenta . as is well known , the ordering of eq .",
    "( [ order ] ) leads to considering the logarithms of @xmath4 only . on the other hand ,",
    "as we investigate the small-@xmath0 region , we will lift this ordering , allowing for the transverse momentum of quarks in any ladder rung to reach the lowest limit @xmath23 .",
    "obviously , this increases the region of integration over @xmath18 .",
    "let us represent any graph contributing to @xmath10 as a convolution of two amplitudes connected by the rung with minimal @xmath24 . in the dglap ,",
    "such a representation is given by the graph in fig.[ladder ] , with the minimal @xmath24 in the lowest rung only ; now , having lifted the @xmath24 ordering of eq .",
    "@xmath25 , in the same graph , the minimal @xmath24 is assigned to any rung .",
    "summing up such graphs to all loops and adding the born graph , one arrives at the equation represented in fig.[equation]a if we use the dglap ordering and at that of fig.[equation]b if one drops the @xmath24 ordering .",
    "the blobs in fig.[equation ] denote that radiative corrections to all orders in qcd coupling are taken into account . as a result of the infrared regularization we have chosen , the amplitude @xmath10 is @xmath15-dependent now and one can evolute @xmath10 with respect to @xmath15 .",
    "it is convenient to use the mellin transform for the amplitude @xmath10 :    @xmath26    as we are going to take into account both logarithms of @xmath27 and of @xmath28 in every order in @xmath1 , we assume that    @xmath29    where    @xmath30    and @xmath31 has to be properly defined . equation ( [ mb ] ) leads to @xmath32 , which agrees with eqs .",
    "( [ fborn ] ) and ( [ defm ] ) .",
    "let us note that @xmath31 must have a non - zero imaginary part , @xmath33 , when @xmath7 is positive and @xmath34 when @xmath7 is negative .",
