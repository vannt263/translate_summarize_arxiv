    "it is well established that the thermodynamic properties of a physical system can be derived from a knowledge of the partition function . since the discovery of statistical mechanics it has been a central theme to understand the mechanism how the analytic partition function for a finite - size system acquires a singularity in the thermodynamic limit if the system undergoes a phase transition . the answer to this quest",
    "was given in 1952 by lee and yang in their famous papers  @xcite .",
    "they considered the partition function of the ising model as a polynomial in activity ( @xmath1 , where h is a magnetic field ) and studied the distribution of zeros of the partition function in the complex activity plane . it was shown that phase transitions occur in the systems where continuous distribution of zeros of the partition function cuts the real axis in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "also proved , was the circle theorem , which states that zeros of the partition function of the ferromagnetic ising model lie on the unit circle in the complex activity plane ( _ yang - lee zeros _ ) .",
    "later , fisher  @xcite initiated a study of zeros of the partition function in the complex temperature plane ( _ fisher zeros _ ) .",
    "fisher showed that complex temperature zeros of the partition function of the ising model in zero magnetic field on a square lattice lie on two circles @xmath2 , where @xmath3 . since that time there has been a considerable body of work studying the partition function zeros of the ising and potts  @xcite models on various regular lattices , most notably in recent years  @xcite .",
    "zeros of the partition function were also studied for spin models defined on hierarchical  @xcite and recursive  @xcite lattices , random graphs  @xcite and aperiodic systems  @xcite , spin glasses  @xcite , percolation and self - organized criticality models  @xcite .",
    "nowadays , the investigation of zeros of the partition function becomes a powerful tool for studying phase transitions and critical phenomena .",
    "recently , much attention has been attracted to the study of zeros of the partition function in one - dimensional systems in connection with helix - coil transitions in biological macromolecules  @xcite .",
    "hence , it is very important to study the general properties of zeros of the partition functions for different one - dimensional systems .    in 1994 ,",
    "glumac and uzelac  @xcite using the transfer matrix method studied the yang - lee zeros of the one - dimensional ferromagnetic potts model for non - integer values of @xmath4 .",
    "they showed that for @xmath5 the yang - lee zeros are located on a real interval and for low temperatures these are located partially on the real axis and in complex conjugate pairs on the activity plane .",
    "later on , monroe  @xcite numerically studied the yang - lee zeros of the potts model for some particular values of @xmath6 .",

    "a classification of yang - lee and potts zeros is given . in section 5 , the fisher zeros in a nonzero magnetic field are investigated .",
    "it is shown that the fisher zeros in a nonzero magnetic field located on several lines in the complex temperature plane and the density of fisher zeros is singular at the edge singularity points with the same critical exponent as that of both the yang - lee and potts zeros , @xmath15 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the one - dimensional @xmath6-state potts model in a magnetic field is defined as follows @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the kroneker delta function , @xmath18 denotes the potts variable at site @xmath19 and takes the values @xmath20 . the first sum in the r.h.s . of ( [ ham ] )",
    "goes over all edges and the second one over all sites on the lattice . for @xmath21",
    "the model is ferromagnetic and for @xmath22 is antiferromagnetic .",
    "note that due to the symmetry , the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) is the same if the external field @xmath23 is applied to any spin state , namely , if @xmath24 in ( [ ham ] ) is replaced by @xmath25 for any @xmath26 . for @xmath14 the potts model corresponds to the ising model and in order to keep the analogy with the ising model we designate @xmath23 as a magnetic field .",

    "@xmath39 does not have a direct physical meaning , but the thermodynamic functions , such as the magnetization , the specific heat and etc .",
    ", may be expressed in terms of @xmath39 .",
    "for example , the magnetization for our model in the thermodynamic limit has the form @xmath43 where @xmath44 is an attracting fixed point of the mapping ( [ xrec ] ) .",
    "it will be shown below how the thermodynamic properties of the model may be defined from the dynamics of the recurrence relation ( [ xrec ] ) .",
    "the mapping ( [ xrec ] ) is a mbius transformation , i.e. a rational map of the form @xmath45 where @xmath46 if @xmath47 , while @xmath48 when @xmath49 .",
    "the dynamics of such maps is well studied  @xcite .",
    "the mapping ( [ xrec ] ) has only two fixed points which are solutions to the equation @xmath50 . according to the theory of complex dynamical systems ,",
    "fixed points are classified as follows : a fixed point @xmath51 is attracting if @xmath52 , repelling if @xmath53 , and neutral if @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is called the eigenvalue of @xmath51 .",
    "it is easy to show that either both fixed points of the mapping ( [ xrec ] ) are neutral , or that one of them is attracting while the other is repelling .",
    "the correspondence between thermodynamical properties of the model and the dynamics of the mapping ( [ xrec ] ) is the following : if for a given temperature and magnetic field ( @xmath56 and @xmath57 ) the mapping ( [ xrec ] ) has an attracting fixed point , then the system is in a stable state and its thermodynamical functions are defined by this fixed point ( see for example ( [ magn ] ) ) . the other fixed point is repelling and does not correspond to any phase . on the other hand , if the iterations of ( [ xrec ] ) do not converge to a fixed point , i.e. the mapping ( [ xrec ] ) has neutral fixed points only , the system undergoes a phase transition .",
    "therefore , the existence of neutral fixed points of ( [ xrec ] ) corresponds to a phase transition in the model .",
    "it was mentioned in the introduction that zeros of the partition function correspond to phase transitions in the model .",
    "thus , zeros of the partition function are associated with neutral fixed points of the corresponding mapping .",
    "these may be found from the conditions of existence of neutral fixed points of the mapping ( [ xrec ] ) .",

    "solutions to this equation for different values of @xmath61 correspond to zeros of the partition function .",
    "hence , the free energy of the model may be written in the form @xmath62 formula ( [ fenergy ] ) may also be derived from the transfer matrix method  @xcite using two non - degenerate eigenvalues of the transfer matrix  @xcite @xmath63 , \\label{eigen}\\ ] ] and the following mathematical identity for any pair of scalars @xmath64 , @xmath65 @xmath66,\\ ] ] where the product is from @xmath67 if @xmath68 is odd ; and from @xmath69 for n even .",
    "moreover , one can easily show that the eigenvalues of fixed points of ( [ xrec ] ) are related to the eigenvalues of transfer matrix  ( [ eigen ] ) as follows @xmath70 hence , the condition of a phase transition @xmath71 ( both @xmath72 and @xmath73 are neutral fixed points ) corresponds exactly to the @xmath74 condition for the eigenvalues of transfer matrix  ( [ eigen ] ) .",
    "it means that the phase transition point based on dynamical systems approach coincides exactly with the phase transition point based on free energy considerations .",
    "this correspondence seems to be general for spin models defined on recursive lattices  @xcite .",

    "we saw that this algorithm is very useful for studying the fisher zeros in an arbitrary magnetic field .",
    "moreover , it is the only method for studying the fisher zeros for non - integer values of @xmath136 , where @xmath136 is the renormalized magnetic field @xmath23 and @xmath158 .    in conclusion",
