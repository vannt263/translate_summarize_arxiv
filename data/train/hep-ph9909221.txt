    "the nucleon spin structure has attracted a lot of attention in the last ten years since the discovery of the so - called  spin crisis \" by the european muon collaboration ( emc)@xcite . during these times , much has been done to understand the spin structure of proton both on the theoretical side and the experimental side ( mostly from the polarized dis data ) .",
    "however , the use of dis data alone does not allow an accurate determination for the polarized parton densities , especially for the polarized gluon distribution , which is crucial important to understand the gluon contribution to the proton spin . and",
    "now , the upgrade of hera collider with polarized electron beam and proton beam at @xmath4 in the near future has been considered for a long time@xcite . with this high energy polarized electron - proton collider",
    ", one can investigate the polarized structure functions in much broader range of @xmath5 and @xmath6 , especially , to very low @xmath5 and high @xmath6 region . and also",
    "the exploration of polarized gluon distribution @xmath7 will become accessible . to determine @xmath7 , various photon - gluon fusion processes can be used .",
    "the typical promising process for this purpose is the large@xmath8 di - jet production@xcite , which is a gluon induced process even in the leading order ( lo ) of qcd calculations .",
    "however , for this process one must deal with the uncertainty arising from the resolved photon contributions . in this paper , we will consider the inelastic @xmath1 production in the polarized photon - hadron collisions . because the inelastic @xmath1 photoproduction is also a gluon induced process",
    ", so this process can be viewed as a possible way to study the polarized gluon distribution in the proton .",
    "furthermore , the resolved photon contribution to this process is negligible in the major kinematical region of the produced @xmath1 .",
    "so , by inducing some kinematical cut , the uncertainties due to the resolved photon contribution can be eliminated safely .",
    "on the other hand , studies of heavy quarkonium production in high energy energies is another hot topic in recent years . in the conventional picture ,",
    "the heavy quarkonium production is described in the color - singlet model@xcite . in this model",
    ", it is assumed that the heavy quark pair must be produced in a color - singlet state in short distance with the same angular - momentum quantum number as the charmonium meson which is eventually observed .",
    "however , with the recent tevatron data on high @xmath9 @xmath1 production appearing , this color - singlet picture for heavy quarkonium production became questionable , the data is larger than the theoretical prediction of the color - singlet model by a factor of about @xmath10@xcite .",
    "this is called the @xmath1 ( @xmath11 ) surplus problem . on the theoretical side ,",
    "the naive color - singlet model has been supplanted by the nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) factorization formalism @xcite , which allows the infrared safe calculation of inclusive charmonium production and decay rates . in this approach",
    ", the production process is factorized into short and long distance parts , while the latter is associated with the nonperturbative matrix elements of four - fermion operators .",
    "so , for heavy quarkonium production , the quark - antiquark pair does not need to be in the color - singlet state in the short distance production stage , which is at the scale of @xmath12 ( @xmath13 is the heavy quark mass ) . at this stage",
    ", it allows the other color configuration than the singlet for the heavy quark pair , such as color - octet .",
    "the later situation for heavy quarkonium production is called the color - octet mechanism . in this production mechanism ,",
    "heavy quark - antiquark pair is produced at short distances in a color - octet state , and then hadronizes into a final state quarkonium ( physical state ) nonperturbatively .",
    "provided this color - octet mechanism , one might provide explain the tevatron data on the surplus of @xmath14 and @xmath15 production@xcite .    even though the color - octet mechanism has achieved some successes in describing the production and decay of heavy quarkonia , more tests of this mechanism",
    "are still needed .",
    "recently , the photoproduction data from hera @xcite puts a question about the universality of the color - octet matrix elements @xcite , in which the fitted values of the matrix elements @xmath16 and @xmath17 are one order of magnitude smaller than those determined from the tevatron data @xcite .",
    "( more recently , possible solutions for this problem have been suggested in@xcite . ) in this situation it is certainly helpful to find other processes to test the color - octet mechanism in the heavy quarkonium production .",
    "so , the inelastic @xmath1 production in polarized photon - hadron collisions can give another independent test of the production mechanism , aside from the unpolarized @xmath1 .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we will give the polarized cross section formula for the inelastic @xmath1 production at the polarized electron - proton collider .",
    "here , we adopt the weizscker - williams approximation to calculate the electroproduction cross section with the photoproduction cross section .",
    "the numerical results are given in sec .",
    "we will display the polarized cross sections for both the polarized photon - proton collisions and the electron - proton collisions .",
    "all of our results are relevant to the energy range of the upgrade polarized hera collider .",
    "we also study the @xmath1 production asymmetry and its dependence on the polarized gluon distributions . in sec .",
    "iv , we give the conclusions .",
    "in photoproduction processes , the electron - proton cross section can be equivalent to the photoproduction cross section convoluted by the photon flux factor from the electron under the weizscker - williams approximation@xcite , @xmath18 here , @xmath19 is the energy fraction of the electron carried by the photon .",

    "@xmath23 is the maximum value of @xmath6 for the photoproduction processes . in the following numerical calculations",
    ", we will adopt @xmath24 .",
    "compared with the original weizscker - williams function , the above equation contains a non - logarithmic term with a singular behavior at @xmath25@xcite",
    ". this term will give non - negligible contributions to the unpolarized cross section .",
    "correspondingly , the polarized electroproduction cross section has the similar form , @xmath26 where the polarized photon flux factor function @xmath27 has been derived in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath28.\\ ] ] this function also contains a non - logarithmic term , which however is not singular at @xmath25 .",
    "the numerical calculations show that this term will contribute about @xmath29 to the total cross section of the inelastic @xmath1 photoproduction at @xmath4 for @xmath24 .",
    "the polarized cross section @xmath30 in the above equation is defined in terms of @xmath31 with definite helicities for incoming particles , @xmath32.\\ ] ]    in our study , we also adopt the weizscker - williams approximation described above to evaluate the inelastic photoproduction of @xmath1 in electron - proton collisions .",
    "that is , the polarized and unpolarized cross sections for @xmath1 production in electron - proton collisions have the following forms , @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the kinematical boundary for the photon energy fraction from the electron beam . in the above equation ,",
    "we do not include the resolved photon contribution to the @xmath1 photoproduction at @xmath2 colliders .",
    "this is because the resolved contribution is important only in the lower @xmath36 region ( @xmath37)@xcite , where @xmath36 is the energy fraction of the produced @xmath1 .",
    "so , by inducing a lower bound cut on @xmath36 , the resolved photon contribution can be eliminated .",
    "@xmath38 is the polarized cross section for the inelastic production of @xmath1 in the polarized photon - proton fusion processes .    at high energies ,",
    "the photoproduction processes proceed predominantly through photon - gluon fusion .",

    "@xmath44 and @xmath45 are the short distance coefficients for the unpolarized and polarized cases respectively for the subprocess @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath47 is the long distance non - perturbative matrix element which represents the probability of the @xmath48 pair in @xmath41 configuration evolving into the physical state @xmath1 .",
    "the short distance coefficients @xmath49 and @xmath50 can be calculated by using perturbative qcd in expansion of powers of @xmath51 .",
    "the long distance matrix elements are still not available from the first principles at present",
    ". however , the relative importance of the contributions from different terms can be estimated by using the nrqcd velocity scaling rules .    in order to suppress the diffractive contribution and higher - twist corrections",
    ", we induced the lower bound cut for the @xmath1 transverse momentum @xmath52 . with this constraints ( non - zero @xmath9 for @xmath1 ) , there are the following @xmath53 partonic processes contributing to @xmath1 inelastic photoproduction in the photon - gluon fusion processes , @xmath54 the first subprocess is the color - singlet process , and the last three processes are all the color - octet processes . the unpolarized cross sections for these processes have been calculated in literature@xcite .",
    "the polarized cross section for the color - singlet process has also been calculated in @xcite .    to calculate the polarized cross sections for the color - octet processes , we employ the _ helicity amplitude _ method . with this method",
    ", one can calculate the cross sections @xmath31 with definite helicities for the incident particles .",

    "we have checked that our results for the unpolarized cross sections are consistent with the results of ref.@xcite . for comparison",

    "the two other color - octet matrix elements , @xmath83 and @xmath84 , are known to be very important in the inelastic @xmath1 photoproduction @xcite . however , their values are not well determined from the present experimental data on @xmath1 productions . here , we just follow ref .  @xcite and take their values tentatively as listed above ( which are also consistent with the naive nrqcd velocity scaling rules ) to see what their contributions to the polarized cross section of the inelastic @xmath1 photoproduction will be .",

    "especially , in the low @xmath76 ( @xmath93 ) region , the production asymmetry @xmath3 for case ( ii ) is very small comparable with zero .    concluding the results displayed in the above four figures ( figs .  1 - 4 ) , we can see that the difference between the color - singlet and color - octet predictions on the distributions behaviors and the absolute sizes of the polarized cross sections @xmath94 and the production asymmetries @xmath3 may provide some information on @xmath1 production mechanism .",
    "that is to say , the inelastic @xmath1 photoproduction in polarized collisions will give another independent test for the color - octet mechanism .",
    "in particular , as shown in the above analysis , the different features of the contributions from the two different color - octet processes may provide further important informations on the mechanism for the inelastic photoproduction of @xmath1 .    comparing the results of figs .  3 and 4",
    ", we can see that the production asymmetries for the polarized electron - proton collisions are all smaller than those for the polarized photon - proton collisions by about one order of magnitude .",

    "the grvs std set give the production asymmetry much larger than those for the other two sets , and the gs - c set and the dds1 set give similar results for the production asymmetry .",
    "we have calculated in this paper the inelastic @xmath1 production in polarized photon - hadron collisions . we have evaluated the polarized production rate and the production asymmetry at polarized electron - proton colliders relevant to the hera energy range .",
