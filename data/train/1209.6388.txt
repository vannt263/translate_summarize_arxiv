    "turbulent fields possess self - similar power - laws , _",
    "i.e. _ , they are fractals @xcite . such power - laws ( _ i.e _ , self - similarity ) are found in systems where the underlying physical processes are the same at all scales ( _ e.g. _ , vortex or flux tube stretching suggested by ) . in these systems , the fields have the same degree of complexity ( look the same ) regardless of the observational resolution . for example , incompressible magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) is expected @xcite and found ( _ e.g. _ , ; ) to display self - similar magnetic energy spectra .",
    "power - law magnetic energy spectra are also seen in compressible , stratified mhd photospheric simulations @xcite including those with realistic radiation and partial ionization @xcite .",
    "power - laws are found in solar observations of the line - of - sight magnetic energy , kinetic energy , and even the granulation intensity @xcite .",
    "power - laws are , of course , fundamental in measurements of the fractal dimension of magnetic structures in both observations and simulations ( _ e.g. _ , ) .",
    "both the observations and simulations above indicate that the quiet sun magnetic field is likely turbulent .    the application of turbulent self - similarity to estimate the true mean unsigned vertical flux from magnetograms was introduced by @xcite ( @xcite , hereafter pgds2009 ) .",
    "define the `` net '' flux ( @xmath4 ) at scale @xmath5 for any vertical field @xmath6 to be the flux remaining after averaging over boxes @xmath7 of edge length @xmath5 : @xmath8 where the boxes partition the total area : @xmath9 .",
    "the unsigned flux of the field is given by @xmath10 the ratio of the net flux at length scale @xmath5 to the true mean unsigned flux ( _ i.e. _ , flux _ cancellation _ ) is called the partition function @xmath11 which follows a power - law for self - similar fields , @xmath12 where @xmath1 is the cancellation exponent @xcite . for a completely self - similar field ,",
    "knowledge of net flux at any scale and of the power - law scaling exponent implies knowledge of net flux at all scales and , hence , the unsigned flux .",
    "the two extreme examples are a unipolar field , for which the net flux always equals the unsigned flux ( @xmath13 ) , and a random field . for a random field ,",
    "the observed net flux equals the unsigned flux times the ratio of the noise correlation length to the diameter of the resolution element ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "see the appendix for a mathematical derivation of the random noise case and of the general formula , equation ( [ eq : extrapolate ] ) , to determine the unsigned flux for a completely self - similar field given @xmath1 and the correlation length below which the field becomes smooth .    under the assumption that the quiet - sun magnetic field is turbulent , the theoretical framework in the appendix applies .",
    "this might suggest that the unsigned quiet - sun flux could be deduced from zeeman - based instruments .",
    "such studies have previously been made ( pgds2009 ; ) .",
    "pgds2009 observed a power - law in @xmath15 ( which they dubbed the `` cancellation function '' when applied to a magnetogram ) down to @xmath16 km with @xmath17 in _ hinode _ spectro - polarimeter ( sp ; ) data .",
    "note that power - laws for @xmath15 have previously been seen in simulations of the electric currents @xcite and in solar observations of current - helicity @xcite .",
    "pgds2009 used equation ( [ eq : extrapolate ] ) to estimate the net flux at a scale of @xmath18 m to be @xmath19 g .",
    "turbulent power - laws ( _ e.g. _ , energy spectra and @xmath15 ) extend only down to the dissipative range , but the magnetic diffusion scale is expected to be significantly smaller than @xmath18 m . thus , the extrapolation was taken as a lower bound , @xmath20 g ( gauss ) .",
    "this result was found to be in agreement with a separate extrapolation from radiative mhd simulations .",
    "other estimates of @xmath1 can be made .",
    "found a 30% increase in flux changing from a resolution of 1@xmath21  to 0.33@xmath21  which indicates @xmath22 . found a factor of 3.7 more flux on doubling of resolution , indicating @xmath23 .",
    "using many instruments with different spatial resolutions , fit @xmath24 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath1=1 .",
    "the data set used by pgds2009 was recalibrated by leading to more pronounced high field strength tails in the flux probability distribution .",
    "the power law from the recalibrated magnetogram yielded a value of @xmath1 that is half of the value derived by pgds2009 .",
    "in addition to the sp magnetogram computed cancellation functions from a set of _ hinode _ narrow - band filter imager ( nfi ) na i @xmath25 magnetograms .",
    "the resulting @xmath1 was found to be 0.127 , _",
    "i.e. _ , very similar to the value for the recalibrated sp magnetogram . in order to agree with hanle - based magnetic field measurements ,",
    "this cancellation function needs to be extrapolated down to a spatial scale of 10100 m.    another application for using the fractal nature of magnetic fields is in flare predictions .",
    "previous works ( , @xcite ; ) have shown it to be promising . however , as in the case of cancellation functions , the data - sample sizes used to study the suitability of the method have been limited .",
    "recently has shown how previous analyses may have been misleading : a statistical comparison of flaring and non - flaring active regions found that the fractal properties of the line - of - sight magnetic field can not distinguish flaring and non - flaring active regions .",
    "many of the previous works , however , used current helicity , not magnetic flux , for the analysis and therefore the conclusions of may not apply to them .    prompted by the results of pgds2009 , , and , we suggest that measurements of the cancellation function do not confront the reality of the observational data . such confrontation is the aim of this paper .",
    "we analyze the statistics of quiet sun cancellation functions using magnetograms from three different instruments .",
    "we test if the cancellation exponent @xmath1 is robust within and among the instruments to point out observational artifacts in the measurement of @xmath1 and to determine if any conclusive values or bounds can be made with existing data .",
    "we use altogether @xmath26800 magnetograms from the helioseismic and magnetic imager ( hmi ; ) on the _ solar dynamics observatory _ ( sdo ) satellite , michelson doppler imager ( mdi ; ) on the _ solar and heliospheric observatory _ ( soho ) sarellite , and _ hinode _ sp . the largest data set , 700 hmi magnetograms , allows us to characterize the variation within a single instrument .",
    "data from mdi and sp allow for inter - instrument comparisons and for identification of possible instrumental artifacts as well as for determination of the effects of spatial resolution and magnetogram noise .",
    "the hmi data consist of daily ( from end of march 2010 to mid - june 2011 ) 4 s integration magnetograms taken around 12:00 ut .",
    "we analyze a @xmath27 pixel ( @xmath28 @xmath21@xmath29 @xmath21 ) area around the disk center . for mdi",
    ", we use @xmath30 pixel ( @xmath31 @xmath21@xmath32 @xmath21 ) sub - regions , excluding active regions , in high resolution magnetograms ( level 1.8 ) near the solar disk center . note that a calibration coefficient ( bscale=2.81 ) is applied to the mdi magnetograms to convert from counts to gauss leading to the magnetograms being quantized in units of bscale .",
    "the sp magnetograms are the longitudinal magnetic field measurements in level 1d data with exposure times varying between 1.6 and 12 s. both @xmath260.16@xmath21  and @xmath260.32@xmath21  pixel size magnetograms are included in the data set .",
    "we choose observations of quiet sun taken near the disk center .",
    "the size of sp magnetograms ranges from @xmath26 @xmath33 to @xmath34 pixels ( @xmath35 @xmath21@xmath36 @xmath21160 @xmath21@xmath37 @xmath21 ) .",
    "cancellation functions [ @xmath15 ] are computed for each magnetogram using the monte carlo technique of .",
    "linear fits to @xmath15 in log - log space are made for three different spatial scales : small scale @xmath392@xmath21   ( exponent @xmath40 ) , intermediate scale 25@xmath21  ( @xmath41 ) and large scale 29 @xmath21(@xmath42 ) . while the physical scales are the same for all instruments , the number of pixels for fitting the exponent varies due to the instruments different pixel sizes ( hmi @xmath260.5@xmath21 , mdi @xmath260.6@xmath21 , sp @xmath260.16@xmath21or @xmath260.32@xmath21 ) .",
    "the spatial scales were chosen to be sensitive to the scales most affected by noise ( @xmath40 ) and scales not dominated by noise , but still below the spatial scale of the network ( @xmath41  and @xmath42 ) .",
    "the overlap of @xmath41  and @xmath42  ensures that enough data points ( 14 for hmi , 11 for mdi and 24 or 47 , depending on pixel size , for sp ) are included in fitting @xmath42  and that the results are not strongly sensitive to the upper cut - off ( 5@xmath21  or 9@xmath21 ) of the fitted spatial scales .",
    "additionally , the mean unsigned flux @xmath43 and flux imbalance @xmath44/@xmath43 are computed for each magnetogram .",
    "the results of the analysis on the hmi cancellation function are summarized in figure [ fig : hmi - all ] and table [ table : hmi - mdi ] .",
    "compared to large spatial scales ( @xmath4510@xmath21 , for which we do not fit a power - law ) , the exponents at the smaller scales are fairly similar : @xmath41  and @xmath42are nearly identical , which indicates that we are fitting a genuine power - law at these scales ( 2@xmath21to 9@xmath21 ) .",
    "@xmath15  turns up at the small scales as is demonstrated by @xmath40  having @xmath2630% higher values than @xmath41  and @xmath42 .",
    "the increase is partially due to contributions from noise becoming more dominant ( see section [ sec : noise ] and note that @xmath46 ;    all exponents decrease as a function of @xmath43 , @xmath43@xmath47 for @xmath48pixel . the more flux there is in the magnetogram , the smaller each @xmath1 is . a linear fit of @xmath1 as a function of @xmath49@xmath43  shows that the decrease is strongest for @xmath42  and weakest for @xmath40 .",
    "no correlation is found for @xmath1 and the global ( full - disk ) unsigned flux , which reflects the overall activity present on the solar disk at a given time : the cancellation functions reflect the local magnetic environment , whose fractal properties do not appear to be influenced by the global field .",
    "@xmath1 does not depend on the flux imbalance at small imbalances ( below @xmath2610% ) . for imbalances greater than @xmath2610%",
    "@xmath1 decreases with increasing imbalance on all spatial scales .",
    "the exponents show no strong temporal evolution or indications of the exponent changing as solar activity increases ( figure [ fig : hmi - ts ] ) .",
    "since the activity in the rising phase of the solar cycle emerges at high latitudes , it is not surprising that no significant change in the exponent is seen near disk center .",
    "the results for mdi are shown in figure [ fig : mdi - all ] and table [ table : hmi - mdi ] .",
    "they are qualitatively similar to hmi , confirming that the trends ( @xmath43 , flux imbalance ) are of solar , not instrumental , origin .",
    "the exponents are larger and have more scatter ( standard deviation is 9% of the mean ) .",

    "cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      an examination of tables [ table : sp ] and [ table : inw ] suggests that the cancellation exponent is larger for noisier instruments and shorter exposures , _",
    "i.e. _ , for noisier magnetograms .",
    "we now demonstrate that this is the case by artificially adding noise to our magnetograms .",
    "the first panel in figure [ fig : noise ] shows how an hmi cancellation function changes as random - distributed noise is incrementally added to the magnetogram prior to computing @xmath15 .",
    "adding noise changes first the smallest scales .",
    "as the amount of noise increases the scales affected by noise also increase .",
    "for hmi adding 1 g ( random numbers with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one ) of noise does not change the cancellation function noticeably and only a small difference is seen for 3 g. in contrast , adding noise at the 6 and 15 g levels , respectively , significantly alters @xmath15 on increasing spatial scales . that no change is visible for @xmath50 g , gives us a measure of noise in the hmi magnetogram : between 3 and @xmath51 g .",
    "the remaining panels in figure [ fig : noise ] show how the small scale cancellation exponents for the different instruments react to increased noise .",
    "( noise was added in units of counts ( 1 count=2.81 g ) to the mdi magnetograms . )",
    "all of the @xmath40 , as a function of noise curves , have the same general shape ( rightmost panel in figure [ fig : noise ] ) : they start with a plateau and after an instrument - specific threshold ( magnetogram noise level ) is reached , @xmath40  begins to increase linearly as a function of added noise .",
    "the nominal noise values ( upper limits ) of the different instruments can be defined as the full width at half maximum of gaussian fits to the magnetic flux histograms .",
    "the widths are 31.6 g for mdi , 21.1 g for hmi , and 13.5 g for sp . in the linear increase regime",
    "the increase in @xmath1 per added noise is 0.01 per g for mdi and 0.02 per g for sp and hmi .",
    "the length of the plateau and steepness of the increase are related to the inherent noise in the data : the less instrumental noise there is , the more sensitive the cancellation function is to added noise .",
    "sp , which has the lowest nominal noise level , has the shortest plateau and steepest increase , while mdi , the noisiest instrument , is less sensitive to noise .",
    "consistent with the noise experiment , sp has the smallest measured exponents and mdi the largest , suggesting that mdi magnetograms are more strongly affected by noise .",
    "figure [ fig : hmi - smooth ] shows how spatial smoothing changes the cancellation function .",
    "the effect of smoothing is opposite to that of increasing the noise ( recall that @xmath13 for a smooth field and @xmath52 for noise ) .",
    "the exponents decrease with increased spatial smoothing .",
    "this demonstrates how seeing conditions and spatial over - sampling can reduce the measured exponents .",
    "significant artifacts in measuring the cancellation function from current observations have been identified .",
    "the cancellation exponent is sensitive to noise level differences between instruments : noise increases both @xmath1 and the scatter between individual measurements of @xmath1 .",
    "not surprisingly , @xmath1 decreases by seeing and spatial over - sampling .",
    "we also find that @xmath1 is sensitive within a single instrument s observations to magnetic flux imbalances and mean unsigned flux .",
    "a simple model suggests that this dependence is the effect of network elements : they reduce @xmath1 .",
    "this simple model also explains why the value of @xmath1 calculated in pgds2009 and differ : the network is enhanced in the latter study , decreasing @xmath1 .",
    "of all the observational artifacts , the effect of the network can be removed by masking network elements out of magnetograms .",
    "we then find values of @xmath53 for hmi and @xmath54 for sp .",
    "( for mdi the removal of network was not fully successful and the dependence of @xmath15  on the presence of network elements was not entirely removed . )",
    "the difference in @xmath1 between hmi and sp is due to hmi magnetograms being demonstrably more noisy : hmi s noise level is @xmath55 g and sp s is @xmath56 g , at least for determinations of the cancellation exponent ( see figure [ fig : noise ] ) . since noise first affects the smallest scales of the cancellation function , high resolution ( diffraction limit , pixel size , and seeing ) observations with minimal noise",
    "are needed to measure the exponent on scales below a couple of arcseconds .",
    "therefore , no conclusive value of the unsigned flux can be given by cancellation function analysis with current instruments .",
    "an upper bound of the unsigned flux is the best that can be done with the available data .",
    "since sp has the lowest noise level , we can safely conclude @xmath2 .",
    "the quiet - sun magnetic field is not a completely self - similar field : it will become smooth over an order - of - magnitude in scales near the magnetic diffusion scale ( below which there is no further cancellation ) .",
    "however , using @xmath2 and that the power - law ends at @xmath57 m ( the magnetic diffusion scale estimate from pgds2009 ) in equation ( [ eq : extrapolate ] ) , we have an upper bound on the true mean unsigned flux .",
    "we find that @xmath58 g ( standard deviation 44 g ) from sp data with exposure times longer than 5 s. ( note that if the power - law for some reason ends at even larger scales than the @xmath59 m beginning of the diffusive range , this bound still holds . )",
    "the noisier instruments , mdi and hmi , give significantly higher values .",
    "both the noise level and sensitivity of the instruments affect the estimates .",
    "sp being the least noisy of the instruments can be considered as an upper bound for the flux .",
    "found a similar upper bound , @xmath60 g from the scattering line polarization of ce ii .",
    "we found no correlation between @xmath1 and global mean unsigned flux : the small scale ( @xmath3910@xmath21 ) field distribution / fractal geometry is not affected by the global magnetic configuration , at least not during a rising phase of the cycle sampled by hmi .",
    "a study of hmi cancellation functions from the end of the previous solar minimum past the next solar maximum may show how flux from decaying active regions affects the flux distribution in the quiet sun , and possibly give indications of the relative importance of possible quiet - sun small - scale dynamo action in different phases of the solar activity cycle .",
    "it should be emphasized that the present analysis and findings are for quiet sun magnetic fields which are known to be turbulent .",
    "issues identified in the analysis most likely do not affect as strongly measurements of active region fractal dimensions .",
    "the significance of noise in the cancellation statistics may extend to the studies of fractal dimensions and flaring probability ( _ e.g. _ , ) .",
    "based on the current analysis , using less - noisy magnetograms , such as hmi , may show the fractal dimension of the magnetic flux to still have some predictive capability for flaring active regions . to establish the usability of fractal analysis for flare forecasting ,",
    "however , a large sample of flaring and non - flaring active region magnetograms with little noise is needed .",
    "a statistical study of flaring and non - flaring hmi vector magnetograms could also be used to address the differences of using line of sight flux and current helicity for predictions .",
