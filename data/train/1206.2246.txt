    "relativistic heavy ion collisions , involving two nuclei moving close to the speed of light , produce thousands of particles .",
    "the collective motion of the outgoing particles is of special interest because it carries important information about the bulk properties of the sytem .",
    "a handle into the study of such collective motion makes use of the azimuthal distributions of detected particles in non - central collisions  @xcite . for a quantitative description",
    ", such distribution is conventionally decomposed  @xcite by a fourier series @xmath2 where @xmath3 denotes the angle between the particle s azimuthal angle in momentum space and the reaction plane angle .",
    "the reaction plane is defined by the collision axis and the line connecting the centers of two nuclei .",
    "the various coefficients in this expansion can be calculated as  @xcite : @xmath4 the first and the second coefficients are refered to as directed @xmath5 and elliptic flow @xmath6 , respectively , and they both play important roles in describing the collective expansion in azimuthal space .",
    "elliptic flow is produced by the conversion of the initial coordinate - space anisotropy into the momentum - space anisotropy , due to the developed large in - plane pressure gradient  @xcite .",
    "directed flow , which is the focus of this study , describes the  side splash \" of particles measured off mid - rapidity@xcite .",
    "it probes the dynamics of the system in the longitudinal direction .",
    "the shape and magnitude of directed flow in the vicinity of midrapidity are of special interest , specially for protons , because they are sensitive to the equation of state ( eos ) and may carry phase transition signal@xcite .",
    "directed flow has been measured at the ags  @xcite , at the cern sps  @xcite , and at rhic  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the directed flow of protons at rhic has been studied in detail by the star collaboration , for au+au collisions at @xmath7 gev  @xcite and at lower energies  @xcite .",
    "it is worthy of notice , that at energies studied by star , protons and antiprotons exhibit different @xmath8 slope in close - to - central collisions ( 5 - 30% at 200 gev and 10 - 40% at low energies ) , and at low energies the proton @xmath8 slope changes its sign from negative as in peripheral collisions to positive as in close - to - central collisions .",
    "the sign - change of @xmath8 slope has been proposed as a possible signal of phase transition , it is thus necessary to identify other causes that may give rise to the similar sign - change of directed flow in the vicinity of y=0 .",
    "indeed it is mentioned in  @xcite that the observed @xmath1 for protons is a convolution of the directed flow of produced protons with that of protons transported from beam rapidity .",
    "since transported protons come from the original projectile and target nuclei , they preserve the directed flow of spectators . produced protons , on the other hand ,",
    "tend to flow with the bulk .",
    "the flow direction of spectators and bulk are not necessarily equal ; the final @xmath1 observed would then be the result of a competition between the two different proton sources .    in this work",
    "we study the interplay between the directed flow of transported protons and that of non - transported protons , within the framework of the ultra - relativistic quantum molecular dynamics model ( urqmd )  @xcite .",
    "note that although @xmath8 calculated with urqmd does not reproduce the measurement from au+au collisions at @xmath7 gev , as already pointed out in  @xcite , the study of the contributions from transported and non - transported protons to the overall proton @xmath1 can offer insights into the competing dynamics which lead to the final observation of the sign of @xmath8 and its slope in the vicinity of midrapidity .",
    "urqmd is a microscopic transport model based on the covariant propagation of all hadrons along classical trajectories in combination with stochastic binary scatterings , color string formation and resonance decay .",
    "this microscopic transport model describes the phenomenology of hadronic interactions at low and intermediate energies ( @xmath9 gev ) in terms of interactions between known hadrons and their resonances . at higher energies(@xmath10 gev ) , the excitation of color strings and their subsequent fragmentation into hadrons dominates the multiple production of particles in the urqmd model  @xcite .        fig .",
    "[ cartoon ] schematically sketches the exitation and subsequent fragmentation ( @xmath10 gev ) of a baryon - string @xcite : in the first case , shown on top of the figure , the exitation energy is too low to produce new quark pair(s ) , and there is only one baryon a in the final state . in the second case ,",
    "one diquark - antidiquark pair and one quark - antiquark pair are created .",
    "one of the initial quarks ( white circle ) combines with a newly produced diquark ( black circles ) to form the baryon b , the newly produced anti - diquark ( brown circles ) combines with a newly produced anti - quark to form the antibaryon c , and the newly produced quark together with the initial diquark form another baryon d. the third case is similar to the second one , and it shows the produced baryons and a meson . at the end baryon a has three initial quarks ( 3 iq , where iq stands for  initial quark \" ) , baryon d and h each have two initial quarks ( 2 iq ) , baryon b has one initial quark ( 1 iq ) , and baryon g has zero initial quark ( 0 iq ) .",
    "the two anti - baryons ( c and g ) each have zero initial quark ( 0 , iq ) .",
    "the more initial quarks can be found in a particle , the more initial information that particle carries . by tracing the number of initial quarks in a particle ,",
    "we classify particles as produced or transported particles . in this article , baryons with three initial quarks",
    "are regarded as transported baryons , and all other baryons that have at least one produced quark are regarded as non - transported .",
    "a particular subgroup of the latter are the produced baryons with zero initial quarks .",
    "produced baryons should be similar to anti - baryons in many respects as both groups are made of produced quarks .",
    "after the process of fragmentation excitation of baryon - strings , baryons produced ( mostly unstable baryons ) are subject to multiple scatterings .",
    "when the energy of a binary collision is lower than 5 gev ( @xmath9 gev ) , there will be no strings involved and there are no new quark pairs produced . during this process",
    "the unstable baryons do decay but the number of constituent quarks does not change .",
    "for example , in the case of a @xmath11 decay into a proton and a pion , one can still identify how many quarks in the daughter proton are originated from initial quarks by tracing the quark constituent of its parent , @xmath11 .",

    "[ yield ] shows the rapidity distribution of protons and anti - protons for au+au collisions at @xmath12 gev and 200 gev , calculated with the urqmd model .",
    "the selection on centrality ( 10%-70% ) and transverse momentum @xmath13 ( @xmath14 gev/@xmath15 ) are chosen to match those used in  @xcite .",
    "the distribution of transported , non - transported , and produced protons are drawn separately .",
    "as expected , the transported protons peak at beam rapidity and the produced ones , at midrapidity . not surprisingly ,",
    "the distribution of produced protons is similar to that of anti - protons ( to first order ) , and the remaining difference comes from their separate production mechanisms .",
    "for example , for each produced baryon there is an accompanying anti - baryon produced but that statement is not necessarily true for anti - baryons .",
    "in addition , antiprotons are subject to annihilation while protons are not .",
    "the transported ( produced ) protons accounts for 12% ( 2.1% ) of inclusive protons at 11.5 gev , and 0.91% ( 50% ) at 200 gev .",
    "the baryon stopping effect is seen at both energies . at midrapidity , transported protons dominate over produced protons at 11.5 gev , while at 200 gev , the opposite is true .",
    "note that the sum of the yield of transported and produced protons does not give the inclusive proton yield because some of the protons can be regarded neither as transported nor produced .",
    "those are protons that have 2 or 1 initial quarks , and they account for a large fraction of the total number of protons . by definition",
    "the inclusive proton yield is a sum of transported and non - transported proton yields .     for protons and anti - protons in au+au collisions at @xmath12 gev for centrality 10%-70% , from urqmd calculation .",
    "see text for explanation on individual protons groups . ]    to illustrate the effect of the mixture of initial and produced quarks on the shape of @xmath8 figure  [ v1_y ] shows @xmath8 plotted for all proton ( antiproton ) groups for au+au collisions collisions at @xmath12 gev .",
    "it is seen that for transported protons ( 3 iq ) , the @xmath8 slope is positive at midrapidity . with the replacement of even only one initial quark by a produced quark ,",
    "as shown by the case ( 2 iq ) , the @xmath8 shape becomes extremely flat at midrapidity . as more initial quarks are replaced , the @xmath8 slope changes sign to negative and continues to decrease monotonically with descreasing number of initial quarks . for",
    "produced protons ( 0 iq ) , the sign of the @xmath8 slope agrees with that of antiprotons as expected because both are produced particles .",
    "the @xmath8 of inclusive protons is a convolution of @xmath8 and the relative yields of each individual proton group . for clarity",
    ", the figures shown below do not display the two intermediate proton groups ( 1 iq and 2 iq groups ) .",
    "slope as a function of centrality for protons and anti - protons for au + au collisions at @xmath16 11.5 ( left ) and 200 ( right ) gev , calculated with the urqmd model . ]    in fig .",
    "[ v1_cent ] we present the centrality dependence of @xmath17 slope at midrapidity in au+au collisions at @xmath12 gev and 200 gev , for transported , non - transported , produced , and inclusive protons .",
    "the slope for antiprotons is also shown for comparison . here",
    "the slope is extracted from the normalized ( @xmath18 ) rapidity distribution , where @xmath19 is the beam rapidity .",
    "our results are obtained by integrating over transverse momentum ( @xmath20 ) from 0.4 to 1.0 gev as done in  @xcite . at 11.5 gev ,",
    "as the overlap between colliding ions range from central to peripheral , the @xmath17 slope of transported protons increases rapidly , reaches a maximum at @xmath2120% centrality and then decreases .",
    "the opposite trend is seen for produced protons .",
    "the slope of @xmath17 extracted from non - transported protons is negative in most centralities , ranges between positive and negative values , as non - transported protons also include intermediate proton groups other than produced protons .",
    "the @xmath17 slope of inclusive protons is the result of competing effects from directed flow between transported and non - transported protons . because the yield of non - transported protons dominate over that of transported protons , in peripheral collisions the sign of the @xmath17 slope agree with that of non - transported protons . as the centrality decreases , transported proton @xmath17 slope increases .",
    "this effect gradually overcomes the effect of directed flow from non - transported protons and change the sign of the @xmath17 slope to positive . in most central collisions , @xmath1 from all groups",
    "vanishes due to the symmetrical shape of the collision .",
    "this explains the sign change of @xmath17 seen in data  @xcite .",
    "similarly , the trend of the @xmath17 slope at 200 gev can be explained with similar arguments .",
    "note that at 200 gev , the @xmath17 slopes are negative at all centralities .",
    "this can be due to the fact that at 200 gev the transported proton yield is too small and the overall effect is driven by non - transported protons . for the same reason , a difference between proton and antiproton @xmath1 is observed as seen in the inset , similar to what is shown in  @xcite .",

    "[ energydependence ] . based on urqmd calculation ,",
    "the slopes of @xmath17 extracted from produced protons are negative and they follow more or less a similar behavior as the one extracted from antiprotons , while the @xmath17 slopes for transported protons are all positive .",
    "the @xmath17 slope for inclusive protons is a convoluted effect produced by transported and non - transported protons .",
    "it is positive at 7.7 , 11.5,19.6 , 27 and 39 gev , decreases monotonically with increasing energy for @xmath011.5 gev and beyond , and becomes negative at 62.4 gev .",
    "the sign change of @xmath17 slope is also seen in experimental data  @xcite , although the energy at which the @xmath17 slope changes sign is lower ( 11.5 gev ) .",
    "these findings suggest that the apparent  collapse \" of @xmath1 , defined by a flat shape of the proton @xmath17 , or the sign - change of the proton @xmath17 slope , can be explained by the interplay between transported protons and non - transported protons .",
    "directed flow of inclusive , transported protons and non - transported protons ( including produced protons ) , as well as antiprotons , have been studied with the urqmd model at rhic energies .",
    "it is found that the integrated directed flow decreases monotonically as a function of collision energy for @xmath011.5 gev and beyond .",
    "however , the sign - change of directed flow of inclusive protons , as a function of centrality and collision energy , can be explained by the competing effect of directed flow between transported and non - transported protons .",
