    "fractal transformations are mappings between pairs of attractors of iterated function systems .",
    "they are defined with the aid of code space structures , and can be quite simple to handle and compute .",
    "they can be applied to digital images when the attractors are rectangular subsets of @xmath0 .",
    "they are termed `` fractal '' because they can change the box - counting , hausdorff , and other dimensions of sets and measures upon which they act . in this paper",
    "we substantially generalize and develop the theory and we illustrate how it may be applied to digital imaging . previous work was restricted to fractal transformations defined using fractal tops .",
    "fractal tops were introduced in @xcite and further developed in @xcite .",
    "the main idea is this : given an iterated function system with a coding map and an attractor , a _ section _ of the coding map , called a tops function , can be defined using the `` top '' addresses of points on the attractor . given two iterated function systems each with an attractor , a coding map , and a common code space , a mapping from one attractor to the other can be constructed by composing the tops function , for the first iterated function system , with the coding map for the second system .",
    "under various conditions the composed map , from one attractor to the other , is continuous or a homeomorphism . in the cases of affine and projective iterated function systems , practical methods based on the chaos game algorithm @xcite are feasible for the approximate digital computation of such transformations .",
    "fractal tops have applications to information theory and to computer graphics .",
    "they have been applied to the production of artwork , as discussed for example in @xcite , and to real - time image synthesis @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we extend the theory and applications .",
    "much of the material in this paper is new .",
    "the underlying new idea is that diverse sections of a coding map may be defined quite generally , but specifically enough to be useful , by associating certain dynamical systems with the iterated function system .",
    "these sections provide novel collections of fractal transformations ; by their means we generalize the theory and applications of fractal tops .",
    "we establish properties of fractal transformations , including conditions under which they are continuous .",
    "the properties are illustrated by examples related to digital imaging .    a notable result , theorem [ goldthm ] , states the existence of nontrivial fractal homeomorphisms between attractors of some affine overlapping iterated function systems .",
    "the proof explains how to construct them .",
    "an example of one of these new homeomorphisms , applied to a picture of lena , is illustrated in figure [ goldenlenna ] .",
    "goldenlenna.png    in section [ ifssec ] we review briefly the key definitions and results concerning point - fibred iterated function systems on compact hausdorff spaces .",
    "since this material is not well - known , it is of independent interest .",
    "the main result is theorem [ mainifsthm ]",
    ". this can be viewed as a restatement of some ideas in @xcite ; it describes the relationship between the coding map and the attractor of a point - fibred iterated function system",
    ".    in section [ topsec ] we define , and establish some general properties of , fractal transformations constructed using sections of coding maps . in theorem [ sectionthm ] we present some general properties of coding maps",
    ". then we use coding maps to define fractal transformations and , in theorem [ ctyfractaltransthm ] , we provide sufficient conditions for a fractal transformation to be continuous or homeomorphic .    in section [ masksec ]",
    "we define two different types of section of a coding map : ( i ) with the aid of a _ masked _ dynamical system ; and ( ii ) with the aid of fractal tops .",
    "theorem [ maskthm ] establishes the connection between the masked dynamical system and a _ masked section _ of the coding map .",
    "theorem [ maskbranchthm ] includes a statement concerning the relationship between the masked section to the coding map and the shift map .",
    "here we also establish the relationship between fractal tops and masked systems .",
    "a key result , theorem [ l : disjoint ] , gives a condition under which the ranges of different masked sections intersect in a set of measure zero .",
    "this enables the approximate storage of multiple images in a single image , as illustrated in figure [ allmasked ] .",
    "in section [ appsec ] we apply and illustrate the theoretical structures of sections 2,3 , and 4 , in the context of digital imaging .",
    "our goal is to illustate the diversity of imaging techniques that are made feasible by our techniques , and to suggest that fractal transformations have a potentially valuable role to play in digital imaging . in section [ appsec1 ]",
    "we illustrate how fractal transformations may be applied to image synthesis , that is to making artificial interesting and even beautiful pictures .",
    "specifically we explain how the technique of color - stealing @xcite extends to masked systems . in section [ fhomsec ]",
    "we apply fractal homeomorphisms , using theorem [ ctyfractaltransthm ] , to transform digital images , for image beautification , roughening , and special effects ; in particular , we present and illustrate theorem [ goldthm ] which extends the set of known affine fractal homeomophisms .",
    "in section [ filtsec ] we consider the idea of composing a fractal transformation , discretization , and the inverse of the transformation to make idempotent image filters . in section [ packsec ]",
    "we apply theorem [ l : disjoint ] to the approximate storage or encryption of multiple images in a single image . in section [ meassec ]",
