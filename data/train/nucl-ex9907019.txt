    "<S> the elastic scattering of @xmath0 has been studied by means of a phase - shift analysis of 21 angular distributions ranging from @xmath1 mev up to @xmath2 mev . a tri - dimensional plot of the reflection coefficient of the s - matrix as a function of the angular momentum and the energy shows a well defined region of energy , which separates two regimes : strong absorption for higher energies and the so called `` anomalous transparency regime '' , recently observed in this system at low energies . </S>",
    "<S> the argand diagrams of the s - matrix in angular momentum space also present very contrasting behaviours in the two regions with very rapidly varying phases in the low energy region , which we associate with a parity dependent term in the s - matrix directly related to significant coupling to the elastic transfer of a @xmath3 nucleus .    </S>",
    "<S> = -1.25 cm    2.0 cm    an anomalous transparency has been observed@xcite in the @xmath0 system at energies around and slightly above the coulomb barrier ( @xmath4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the angular distributions of the elastic scattering are characterized by oscillations and require a very small imaginary part in the optical potential in order to be fitted . </S>",
    "<S> these oscillations are present in practically the whole angular distribution , even at forward and intermediate angles , in contrast to the well - known phenomenon of anomalous large angle scattering ( alas ) , which is observed at slightly higher energies ( @xmath5 ) and is characterized by oscillating angular distributions and excitation functions at large angles@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the oscillations observed in the angular distributions of the systems which exhibit alas phenomenon can be reproduced by a background strong absorption s - matrix plus a localized perturbation normally around the grazing angular momentum . </S>",
    "<S> this is an indication that a peripheral process is responsible for the oscillations observed at large angles . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling of alpha transfer channels to the elastic scattering can be the origin of this perturbation in the s - matrix@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the anomalous transparency at low energies shows a sensitivity of the elastic scattering to the nuclear interior , whose signatures in the s - matrix are a very rapid variation of the phases and strong oscillations in the reflection coefficients , in contrast to a typical strong absorption s - matrix , which is a smooth function of the angular momentum .    in this paper we present the results of an extensive phase - shift analysis of the 21 available angular distributions of the @xmath0 elastic scattering@xcite which show the clear transition that occurs between the two regimes . </S>",
    "<S> the phase - shift analysis was performed using a method we recently developed @xcite , which allows the determination of the elastic s - matrix elements and their associated errors , using a chi - square minimization algorithm specially developed for the scattering problem . </S>",
    "<S> the method has proven to be quite versatile at low energies , where the convergence is achieved very rapidly .    </S>",
    "<S> there are two important aspects in the phase - shift analysis : the starting s - matrix for the search and the maximum number of partial waves used in the search @xmath6 . as a starting point for the analysis </S>",
    "<S> , we used the s - matrix generated by the optical model potential named x3 in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this potential reproduces well the forward angle region and the mean slope of the angular distributions in the range of energy studied , but not the oscillations .    </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath7 we use the s - matrix elements calculated by the x3 optical potential . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath8 the s - matrix elements are obtained by search . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum angular momentum in the analysis was choosen by the condition @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> this analysis is more reliable , as far as ambiguities are concerned due to the fact that the errors of the s - elements are also calculated . </S>",
    "<S> we observed that when the error bars are small , the final s - matrix is practically independent of the starting point of the search and of the maximum number of partial waves used in the analysis . on the other hand , if the error bars are big a large ambiguity in the final s - matrix is observed . </S>",
    "<S> the precision of the final s - matrices is related to the quality and completeness of the experimental angular distributions .    </S>",
    "<S> the result of this analysis is presented in figure 1 in a tri - dimensional plot of the reflection coefficients ( @xmath10 ) as a function of the laboratory energy and of the angular momentum . </S>",
    "<S> we can observe the clear transition between the two regimes occuring at laboratory energies around 28 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the coulomb barrier for this system is @xmath11 mev , calculated using the best fit optical potential of reference @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the reflection coefficients for energies above 28mev show a relatively smooth transition from unity , at high angular momentum values , to very low values at low partial waves . </S>",
    "<S> this is a typical strong absorption behaviour with a well defined value of the grazing angular momentum . </S>",
    "<S> the very small perturbations observed in this s - matrix at low l - values are responsible for the alas phenomenon . </S>",
    "<S> below 28mev the situation is completely different , with strongly oscillating reflection coefficients as a function of the energy and angular momentum . in this situation , </S>",
    "<S> the grazing trajectories are not well defined in the sense that many different values of angular momentum can be assigned to the condition @xmath12 .    in figures 2a , b , c , </S>",
    "<S> d we plot the reflections coefficients(left ) and argand diagrams(right ) @xmath13 of the s - matrices as a function of the angular momentum at four laboratory energies : 40 , 31.2 , 23 and 20mev . at the two higher energies we observe a typical strong absorption behaviour either in the reflection coefficients or in the argand diagrams which start at @xmath14 for high angular momenta and go smoothly to zero for low angular momenta . </S>",
    "<S> the argand diagram is restricted to the first quarter of the complex plane @xmath15 and @xmath16 showing a small positive nuclear phase corresponding to an attractive nuclear potential . at lower energies , on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , one can observe loops in the argand diagrams showing a rapidly increasing real phase for decreasing angular momenta . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of these loops traversed in the anti - clockwise sense , as l decreases , can be due to a parity dependent term in the s - matrix , as we show qualitatively below .    </S>",
    "<S> in fig.2e we plot the s - matrix obtained by the simple parametrization : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a background s - matrix taken to be of the ericsson form : @xmath19    and @xmath20 is a parity dependent term given by :    @xmath21    the values of the parameters are given:@xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> the loops in the corresponding argand diagrams in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2e(right ) , are introduced by the term @xmath20 . in order to have the correct sense </S>",
    "<S> , loop traversed in anti - clockwise sense as l decreases , it is necessary to use a negative nuclear phase parameter @xmath29 . if @xmath29 is positive , the sense of traversing the loops is opposite to the observed in the experimental argand diagrams . as a negative nuclear phase corresponds to a repulsive nuclear potential , </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the interaction responsible for the parity dependence is repulsive . </S>",
    "<S> this is in agreement with the analysis presented in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite where we found a positive form factor .    </S>",
    "<S> the elastic transfer of a @xmath3 between the @xmath30 target and the @xmath3 projectile can be the physical origin of this parity dependence in the s - matrix as suggested in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> another possible explanation for the loops observed in the argand diagrams in l - space is the presence of regge poles , which would come closer to the real axis in the low energy region , where transparency comes in . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of regge poles would be an indication of a resonant regime at these energies , probably due to quasi - molecular states in the @xmath31 composite system . in order to test this hypothesis , we plotted argand diagrams of the s - matrices as a function of energy for fixed angular momentum . </S>",
    "<S> the argand diagrams in the complex energy plane show an apparently chaotic behaviour and no loops were observed for any angular momentum involved in the scattering . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the resonances , if present , must have widths smaller than 330 kev(c.m . ) which is the energy step of the measurements at low energies . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason we discard the hypothesis of molecular resonances of widths greater than 330 kev .    an interesting phenomenon observed in our analysis , </S>",
    "<S> is the sudden onset of strong absorption at energies @xmath32 mev(c.m ) above the coulomb barrier . </S>",
    "<S> this could be associated with a threshold effect related to the opening of the @xmath33 cluster ( hoyle ) resonance channel in @xmath3 .    </S>",
    "<S> recently we have presented evidence , based on optical model analysis , in support of strong coupling of the elastic @xmath34@xmath30 channel to the elastic transfer channel @xmath35@xmath3 near barrier energies which strongly influences the angular distributions . </S>",
    "<S> further evidence in support of a strong two @xmath3 clustering effect in the ground state of @xmath30 is presented here . </S>",
    "<S> this finding has important implications on the two @xmath3 cluster nature of the ground state of @xmath30 and may potentially be significant in nuclear astrophysics .    </S>",
