    "tangles are more general objects than knots and links and in particular diagrams of oriented reidemeister moves may be considered tangles .",
    "the theorem of reidemeister generalizes for tangles : the set of all oriented reidemeister moves is tangle - generating .",
    "therefore a  set @xmath21 is tangle - generating if and only if every oriented reidemeister move ( in both directions ) may be obtained using moves from @xmath21 .",
    "thus we will drop the _",
    "tangle- _ prefix and call such sets _",
    "generating_. moreover , the result of polyak may be phrased as follows : the set @xmath0 is a  minimal ( with respect to size ) generating subset of oriented reidemeister moves .",
    "we now generalize the problem , considering _ directed oriented reidemeister moves _ , that is , distinguishing between _ forward _ and _ backward _ moves",
    ".    we will call a  reidemeister move of type @xmath11 or @xmath12 _ forward _ if it increases the number of crossings and _ backward _ if it decreases the number of crossings .    for an @xmath7 move ,",
    "let us call the triangle formed by the three crossings in the @xmath7 move diagram the _ vanishing triangle_. there is an ordering of its sides coming from the fact that they belong to distinct strands , and we order them bottom - middle - top .",
    "this ordering gives us an orientation of the vanishing triangle .",

    "forward moves are presented in figures  [ fig : omega1 ] , [ fig : omega2 ] and [ fig : omega3 ] , when considering them as moves from the diagram to the left to the diagram to the right .",
    "we denote forward moves using @xmath32 and backward using @xmath33 , e.g. @xmath34 , @xmath35 or @xmath36 .",
    "these notions are motivated by the definitions of _ positive _ and _ negative _ moves on plane curves introduced by arnold @xcite , but slightly modified , as suggested by stlund @xcite . moreover , in subsection [ subsec : mgs-3 ] we present an  equivalent definition of forward and backward moves of type @xmath7 .    this way we obtain @xmath1 distinct moves .",
    "motivated by polyak s work , we seek to find a  minimal generating subset of these .",
    "the only known results concerning this problem are direct consequences of results concerning generating sets of oriented reidemeister moves : a  set @xmath21 of oriented reidemeister moves is generating if and only if the set of both forward and backward types of moves from @xmath21 is generating .",
    "in particular , polyak s results imply that the set @xmath37 @xmath38 which we call _ ( directed ) polyak moves _ is generating , and every generating subset of directed oriented moves consists of at least @xmath14 moves .",
    "these results are not sharp : potentially , there could be a  smaller generating set , in particular a  proper subset of polyak moves could be generating .",
    "we prove that this is not the case :    [ minimal generating set ] the set of directed polyak moves @xmath39 is a  minimal generating set of oriented directed reidemeister moves .    more generally , any generating subset of directed oriented reidemeister moves must contain :    1 .",

    "this problem seems to be much harder to solve and therefore we reduce it to the question whether the set of directed polyak moves has @xmath6-generating subsets .",
    "theorem [ thm : omega1 ] readily implies    [ @xmath11 in @xmath4-generating subsets of polyak moves ] for any link @xmath4 , any @xmath4-generating subset of directed polyak moves contains moves @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",

    ", the set @xmath59 is a  minimal generating subset of ( undirected ) oriented reidemeister moves .",
    "indeed , hagge @xcite proved that for any knot @xmath6 ( and therefore for any link , too ) there exist two diagrams @xmath60 of @xmath6 such that one can not obtain @xmath61 from @xmath62 without using moves of type @xmath12 , and there exist diagrams @xmath63 of @xmath6 such that @xmath64 can not be obtained from @xmath65 without using moves of type @xmath7 .",

    "the article begins with the proofs of theorems [ thm : omega1 ] , [ thm : omega2 ] and [ thm : omega3 ] in section [ sec : mgs ] , from which theorem [ thm : main ] follows .",
    "the key ingredient to the proof of theorem [ thm : omega3 ] is the introduction of the invariants @xmath66 and @xmath67 , which are thoroughly studied . in section [ sec : polyak ] we study knot diagram invariants and their changes under polyak moves , emphasizing the difference between ascending and descending moves of type @xmath7 .",
    "an invariant @xmath68 , which is a  special case of an  invariant defined by hass and nowik , @xcite is introduced and discussed .",

    "the author would like to thank his advisor , maciej borodzik , for his insight and patience .",
    "in this section we prove theorem [ thm : main ] by proving theorems [ thm : omega1 ] , [ thm : omega2 ] , [ thm : omega3 ] .                considering the changes of @xmath75 under polyak moves as written in table  [ tab : hn - p - change ] , we notice that @xmath68 is invariant under @xmath80 and @xmath81 moves and changes by @xmath82 under @xmath83 moves . carefully investigating the change of @xmath75 under @xmath83 moves we can distinguish between two different situations .",
    "[ def : asc - desc ] we will call an @xmath7 move on an oriented knot diagram to be _ ascending _ ( resp . _ descending _ ) , if the order of three strands involved in the move when traversing the knot , in the direction of orientation , is from bottom to top ( resp . top to bottom ) , as shown ( schematically ) in figure  [ fig : ascending ] ( resp .",
    "figure  [ fig : descending ] ) .                            if we smooth a  diagram @xmath90 at crossing @xmath91 , then the value of any link invariant on the smoothing does not depend on reidemeister moves performed on the smoothed diagram @xmath92 .",
    "what follows is that performing any reidemeister move on a  knot diagram @xmath90 does not change either signs @xmath93 or values of @xmath94 for any crossing @xmath91 outside of the changing disc of this reidemeister move .",
    "therefore , in order to calculate the change of @xmath75 , it suffices to check the values of @xmath95 on diagrams obtained by smoothing the crossings involved in the move",
    ".    an @xmath85 move does not create or cancel crossings , or change signs of any crossings , but moves them in a  particular way , giving a  correspondence between crossings before and after performing the move , as depicted in figure  [ fig : correspondence ] .",
    "we will distinguish these three crossings by strands that pass through them : top and middle , middle and bottom , or bottom and top .",
    "smoothing the crossing of top and middle strand we obtain isotopic links before and after the @xmath85 move ( as seen in figure  [ fig:3a - topmid ] ) .",
    "the same is true for the crossing of middle and bottom strand ( figure  [ fig:3a - midbot ] ) .",
    "the situation is different when considering top and bottom strands crossing .",
    "smoothing before and after the @xmath85 move we obtain two distinct links .                    for an ascending move , the middle ( straight ) strand and the upper - right strand of the smoothing ( as seen in figure  [ fig:3a - ascending - topbot ] )",
    "belong to the same component and the lower - left strand belongs to the other component .",
    "the linking number of the smoothing , which is equal to some number @xmath25 , increases by @xmath49 since the two other crossings are positive and while before the move ( and after smoothing ) these were crossings between strands of one of the components , after the move they become crossings between different components of the link diagram .",
    "the crossing of the top and bottom strand contributes @xmath96 to @xmath75 before the move and @xmath97 after the move .",
    "this , up to a  shift of @xmath25 by @xmath49 , proves the first part of the proposition .                    for a  descending move , the middle strand and the lower - left strand of the smoothing belong to one link component and the upper - right strand to the other component ( figure  [ fig:3a - descending - topbot ] ) .",
    "similarly , in this case @xmath5 positive crossings between these components become crossings between strands of the same link component . therefore in this case the linking number of this smoothing decreases after performing an @xmath85 move . before this move the top and bottom strands crossing contributes @xmath96 to @xmath75 and after the move it contributes @xmath99 to @xmath75 , and the proposition follows .",
    "[ condition - hn ] any knot - generating subset of @xmath102 ( i.e. directed polyak moves with distinct ascending and descending moves ) contains at least one move from the set @xmath103 and one move from the set @xmath104 .",
    "the terms _ ascending _ and _ descending _ with regard to @xmath7 moves are taken from the work of stlund @xcite . in his paper , stlund defines three families of knot diagram invariants , namely @xmath105 for @xmath106 and @xmath107 for @xmath108 and @xmath25 odd .",
    "@xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath107 are invariant with respect to @xmath11 and @xmath12 moves .",
    "moreover , @xmath109 is invariant with respect to descending @xmath7 moves and @xmath110 is invariant with respect to ascending @xmath7 moves .",
    "still , having both @xmath84 and @xmath86 moves ( or @xmath115 and @xmath116 ) is sufficient to meet both this condition and the condition presented in corollary  [ condition - hn ] .",
