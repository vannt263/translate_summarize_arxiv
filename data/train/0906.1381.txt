    "when material objects such as electrodes in micro / nanoelectromechanical system are separated by distances of @xmath5 or less forces of quantum origin become operative @xcite .",
    "these are the van der waals ( vdw ) and casimir forces originating from the same physical basis , but having different names due to historical reasons .",
    "the van der waals force is the short - distances asymptotic of this general force , for which one can neglect the retardation of electromagnetic fields , but the casimir force is realized at larger distances where the retardation is important .",
    "the common origin of the forces is nicely explained by the lifshitz theory @xcite , which is able to describe the transition between the two regimes .",
    "it predicts transition between the casimir and van der waals forces at separations @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the plasma wave length and @xmath8 is the plasma frequency @xcite . keeping in mind the common origin of the forces ,",
    "in what follows we will also use a generalized name _",
    "dispersive forces_.    at separations below @xmath5 the casimir force is very strong and becomes comparable to electrostatic forces corresponding to voltages in the range @xmath9 @xcite , while for separations below @xmath10 the van der waals force dominates any attraction @xcite .",
    "these properties make the dispersive force an important player in nanosciencies .",
    "moreover , from the fundamental point of view , measurements of the forces from nano to microscales have attracted strong interest in a search of hypothetical fields beyond the standard model @xcite .    in the experiments the dispersive forces",
    "are usually measured between a sphere and a plate . in the vdw regime",
    "the force depends on distance @xmath11 as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the radius of the sphere .",
    "fits of the experimental data yielded an effective hamaker constant @xmath14 for gold - water - gold systems @xcite . on the other hand , for @xmath15-air-@xmath15 surfaces studies by tonckt et al .",
    "@xcite using the surface force apparatus in the plane - sphere geometry with millimeter size spheres yielded an effective hamaker constant of @xmath16 for separations @xmath17 .",
    "similar values @xmath18",
    "@xcite were obtained from afm force measurements at separations between @xmath19 - @xmath20 .",
    "we are using here the term `` effective hamaker constant '' because in this distance range the van der waals asymptotic regime is not fully reached . fitting the curve force vs distance following from the lifshitz theory in the range @xmath21 one would find the hamaker constant to be @xmath22 as it is expected between metal surfaces @xcite .",
    "however , in this distance range the experimental determination of the constant for @xmath15-air-@xmath15 is problematic due to the strong influence of surface roughness and the strong jump - up - to - contact by formation of capillary bridges due to adsorbed water @xcite .",
    "it was found that even for the lowest attainable relative humidity @xmath23 large capillary forces are still present .    in this paper",
    "we use the term adsorption in sense of physisorption when the electronic structure of atoms or molecules is barely perturbed upon adsorption .",
    "formation of capillary bridges takes place due to water adsorbed on @xmath15 .",
    "we can expect that the surface of @xmath15 is covered with an ultra thin water layer , which is present on almost all surfaces exposed to air .",
    "experiment @xcite suggest that the thickness of this layer is in the nanometer range .",
    "the natural questions one could ask is how thick the water layer is , and what is the influence of this layers on the dispersive force ? at short separations ,",
    "@xmath24 , these questions become of crucial importance because they place doubts on our understanding of the dispersive forces when experiments under ambient conditions are compared with predictions of the lifshitz theory . in this paper",
    "we are performing the first steps to answer these questions comparing experimental data at short separations with the theoretical predictions for @xmath15 covered with a thin layer of water .",
    "the problem is rather nontrivial since surface wettability can be influenced by other adsorbates ( e.g. , hydrocarbons leading to incomplete wetting ) , the optical properties of real films must be measured correctly @xcite , as well as the influence of surface roughness has to be taken into account @xcite .",
    "the latter lead to uncertainties in the separation distance of real surfaces , and its contribution to the force has to be carefully scrutinized @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we provide information on surface roughnesses and force measurements in the afm experiment , and discuss the distance upon the contact deduced from the measured roughness . in sec .",

    "the dispersive force is measured using the picoforce afm @xcite , between a sphere with a diameter of @xmath25 attached on a @xmath26 long cantilever of stiffness @xmath27 ( as given by the manufacture ) , and an @xmath15 coated silicon plate .",
    "both sphere and plate are coated with @xmath28 of @xmath15 , and afterwards their root - mean - square ( rms ) roughness was measured by afm ( see figs .",

    "[ fig1]a , b ) , which increase the rms roughness value . for plates surfaces ( fig . [ fig2 ] ) these spots were absent leading to the rms roughness @xmath30 @xcite . although the high spots within the contact area may increase the contact separation between bodies , @xmath31 , they deform fast when pushing surfaces into contact to determine the deflection sensitivity .",
    "this is demonstrated by inverse imaging ( see @xcite for detailed explanations ) and mechanics calculations also confirm it @xcite . locally without the spots or with the deformed spots the roughness obtained by inverse imaging was @xmath32 rms or @xmath33 within the contact area of size @xmath34 ( fig . [ fig1]c ) .",

    "we used a different procedure .",

    "[ fig1 ] , [ fig2 ] it is clear that the zero roughness level corresponds to the maximum of the distribution . without",
    "the spots mentioned above these distributions are approximately symmetric .",
    "two rough surfaces in contact are separated by the distance @xmath31 , which is half of the distance between lowest and highest points of the rough profile ( full width of the histogram ) for the sphere plus the same for the plate . in this way we found @xmath37 from multiple afm scans at different locations .",
    "it has to be stressed that this direct way ( from the definition ) to determine @xmath31 is in good correspondence with what we would expect from the electrostatic calibration . in refs .",

    "electrostatic fitting in the range of distances @xmath42 and voltage interval @xmath43 yielded the cantilever stiffness @xmath44 ( with the sphere attached ) and contact potential @xmath45 . after calibration ,",
    "the dispersive force was measured and averaged ( using 40 force curves at 20 different locations yielding an average of 800 curves ) .",

    "each experimental point ( circles ) is defined with rather large uncertainty in distance , which are shown by the horizontal bars for some points .",
    "indeed , the main uncertainty @xmath46 in the dispersive force at short distances comes from the uncertainty @xmath47 in the separation upon contact @xmath37 .",
    "the error in the force due to error in @xmath31 can be estimated as @xmath48 , where @xmath49 in the investigated range of distances .",

    "these errors propagated to the force are negligible in comparison with that arising from @xmath52 .",
    "finally , at separations @xmath53 the force is rather weak , and the error is dominated by thermomechanical noise as it was explained in former studies @xcite .",
    "evaluation of the force based on the lifshitz theory requires the use of the optical properties of the interacting materials as input data .",
    "the optical properties of gold films were measured in air with ellipsometry in the wavelength range @xmath54 @xcite . outside of this interval at low frequencies ( @xmath55 )",
    "the data were extrapolated according to the drude model with the plasma frequency @xmath56 and the relaxation frequency @xmath57 .",

    "it must be the free energy if we consider the interaction at finite temperature @xmath60 . here",
    ", however , we will neglect the thermal effect because our intention is to calculate the force in the short - distance range @xmath61 .",
    "it is known that for these separations and at room temperature the thermal correction is small @xcite .",
    "physically it means that the zero - point quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field give the main contribution to the interaction , while thermally excited fields can be neglected . in this case instead of",
    "summation over the discrete set of matsubara frequencies , one can integrate over a continuous imaginary frequency @xcite .",
    "the resulting interaction energy corresponding to zero temperature can be presented in the following form : @xmath62 here the index @xmath63 is running two possible polarization states of the electromagnetic field , and @xmath64 is the product of the fresnel reflection coefficients for plates 1 and 2 : @xmath65 .",
    "the integration variables have the physical meaning of the imaginary frequency @xmath66 , and the wave vector @xmath67 along the plates .    here",
    "it will be assumed that both interacting surfaces are the same : @xmath68 . for what follows it will be convenient to use index _ 2 _ for quantities related to gold .",
    "if no additional layer on the gold surface exists , then the fresnel coefficients can be written as @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are defined as the normal components of the wave vector in vacuum and in @xmath15 , respectively .",

    "for example , thin metallic film transparent for visible light gives very significant contribution to the force @xcite . on the other hand , a hydrogen - switchable mirror that changes from reflection to transmission in visible light",
    "does not give a measurable effect @xcite .    for practical evaluation of the interaction energy",

    "<S> however , a layer of thickness @xmath2 is allowed by the error margin in force measurements . at shorter separations , @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> , the water layer can have a strong influence as calculations show for flat surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , in reality the influence of surface roughness must also be considered , and it can overshadow any water layer influence at separations comparable to the total sphere - plate rms roughness @xmath4 . </S>"
