    "since its inception more than thirty years ago @xcite , the hubbard model has become the canonical model of interacting fermions on a lattice .",
    "although possibly the simplest model to describe competition between electron itinerancy and localization , with attendant implications for a host of physical phenomena from magnetism to metal - insulator transitions , its simplicity is superficial and an exact solution exists only for @xmath5 dimension @xcite .    recently , metzner and vollhardt @xcite have pointed to the importance of the opposite extreme , @xmath6 . in suppressing spatial fluctuations ,",
    "the many - body problem here simplifies considerably , reducing to a dynamical single - site mean - field problem .",
    "motivated in part by the expectation that an understanding of the @xmath6 limit will serve as a starting point for systematic investigation of finite dimensions , and by the knowledge that some important vestiges of finite-@xmath7 behaviour remain inherent in the @xmath6 limit , intense study of the @xmath2-filled @xmath6 hubbard model on bipartite lattices has since ensued ; for recent detailed reviews , see refs @xcite .",
    "the true ground state of the model is an antiferromagnet ( af ) for all interaction strengths @xmath8 .",
    "one aim of the present work @xcite is to develop a theory for the @xmath6 af which , in contrast to previous theories for the af phase @xcite , is reliable over the entire @xmath3-range , and in particular becomes exact in the @xmath9 strong coupling limit both at @xmath2-filling where the hubbard model maps onto the af heisenberg model , and in the one - hole sector where it reduces to the @xmath10-@xmath11 model @xcite    the majority of previous work @xcite on the @xmath6 hubbard model has focused on the paramagnetic ( p ) phase that results , even for @xmath0 , simply by neglecting the magnetic ordering ( or suppressing it via frustration @xcite ) .",
    "one highlight of this work has been the emergence of a detailed description of the mott metal - insulator transition , although here too the picture is not complete : for example , a firm understanding of the mechanism by which the @xmath0 mott insulating solution is destroyed , and even whether it is continuous or first - order , remains elusive @xcite .",
    "a second aim of this paper is to focus on the insulating state of the p phase , and to develop a theory for it on a footing essentially identical to that for the af , which likewise becomes exact in strong coupling and which permits an analysis of the destruction of the mott insulator .    in seeking to develop a ` unified ' description of the af and p insulating phases , we adopt a rather different approach to that taken in previous work @xcite by introducing explicitly , and from the outset , the notion of site local moments . to this end",
    "we consider first a conventional @xmath0 mean - field approach to the problem in the form of unrestricted hartree - fock ( uhf ) , together with a random phase approximation ( rpa ) for transverse spin excitations of the mean - field state . despite the limitations of such an approach _ per se _ , its importance resides in enabling identification of key low energy scales for insulating spin - flip excitations . since spatial fluctuations are suppressed for @xmath6 , the low energy spin - flip excitations are found to be ising - like and ( for each phase ) characterized by a single scale , @xmath12 .",
    "this has a simple physical interpretation . for the af ,",
    "@xmath13 is essentially just the energy cost of flipping a spin in the nel ordered background ; the ubiquity of antiferromagnetism for all @xmath8 leads naturally to @xmath14 for all @xmath3 , with @xmath15 as @xmath9 as one expects in the heisenberg limit . for the p phase by contrast , where magnetic ordering is absent",
    ", the fact that a given spin is equally likely to be surrounded by @xmath16- or @xmath17-spins and thus ( for @xmath6 ) has as many @xmath16- as @xmath17-spin neighbours , ensures that the corresponding spin - flip energy cost @xmath18 for all @xmath3 in the insulating state .",
    "identification of the low energy spin - flip scales , while crucial to the present work , is preliminary : to transcend the limitations of the conventional ` static ' mean - field approach , single - particle processes must subsequently be coupled dynamically to the transverse spin - flip excitations .",
    "it is this which , in leading as we shall describe to a self - consistent description of the single - particle green functions , enables the aims outlined in the preceding paragraphs to be achieved .",

    "uhf+rpa , and the spin - flip scales referred to above , are discussed in  2 .",
    "emphasis is also given here to simple physical arguments which , in highlighting both the deficiencies and virtues of uhf+rpa , indicate what is required to go beyond it ; particular attention being given in this regard to uhf for the p phase , in view of its close relation to the early work of hubbard @xcite and the falicov - kimball model @xcite .",
    "dynamical coupling of single - particle processes to the transverse spin excitations is considered in  3 , leading (  3.1 ) to a renormalized self - consistent approximation for the ( @xmath0 ) single - particle green functions upon which we subsequently concentrate . in ",
    "3.2 the strong coupling behaviour is examined analytically , and shown to be asymptotically exact for both the p and af phases .",
    "results are given in  3.3 , focusing in particular on single - particle spectra for the af from strong to weak coupling , and on a discussion of the localization characteristics of the single - particle excitations the latter being quite subtle , and pointing to the delicacy of the limit @xmath9 for the af phase .",
    "for the p insulator , single - particle spectra are discussed briefly in  3.3 , before considering the destruction of the mott insulating solution in  4 .",
    "the single - particle gap is found to close continuously , with an exponent @xmath23 , at a critical @xmath24 .",
    "the origins of this behaviour are found to stem from inclusion of the @xmath18 spin - flip scale in the interaction self - energies , pointing to the importance of such throughout the entire insulating regime , and not solely in obtaining the exact strong coupling limit .",
    "the results of  4 are in good agreement with recent numerical work @xcite , as discussed in  5 .",

    "which we emphasize is here meant spin _ unrestricted _ hartree - fock ( uhf) is the simplest non - trivial mean field approximation , in which the notion of site local moments ( @xmath35 ) , regarded as the first effect of electron interactions , enters from the outset . in the af case , the local moments are naturally ordered in an a / b 2-sublattice nel state , with @xmath36 for site @xmath37 in the a / b sublattice respectively @xcite . for the p phase by contrast , the local moments are randomly oriented : a site is equally likely to be a - type as b - type @xcite . in either case",

    "we add further that uhf yields the correct atomic limit ( where @xmath49 ) for either phase , as is clear from eqs ( [ 24],[26],[27 ] ) with @xmath50 .",
    "uhf for the af has been widely studied since the early work of penn @xcite . here",

    "the deficiencies of uhf are however most clearly seen in strong coupling , @xmath9 , where for the af the single - particle spectrum reduces to @xmath55 $ ] as for the atomic limit , @xmath50 .",
    "the physical origin of this is simple : consider for example the upper hubbard band in strong coupling , and imagine adding an @xmath56-spin electron to a site ( b - type ) already occupied by a @xmath57-spin . since uhf is an _",
    "( albeit interacting ) electron approximation , only the added @xmath56-spin can potentially hop to nearest neighbour ( nn ) sites .",
    "but it can not do so in the strong coupling limit , since for the af all nn s to the @xmath57-spin b - site are @xmath16-spins ( a - type ) .",
    "the added @xmath16-spin thus effectively ` sees ' the @xmath17-spin site as an isolated site , hence the emergence of atomic limit behaviour as the strong coupling limit at uhf level .",
    "but while physically transparent , this behaviour is wrong .",
    "in strong coupling , and for the 1-hole sector appropriate to the lower hubbard band ( or 1-doublon sector for the upper hubbard band ) , the hubbard model maps onto the @xmath10-@xmath11 model@xcite .",

    "although it is exact in the atomic limit , uhf by itself can evidently say essentially nothing about the strong coupling limit .",
    "uhf for the @xmath0 paramagnetic phase warrants separate discussion , in part because of its very close relation to two other well known approaches .",
    "the first is that due to hubbard @xcite , with ` spin - disorder scattering ' only .",
    "this is often called the hubbard iii ( hiii ) approximation , and we here refer to it thus ( noting that ` resonant broadening ' contributions are additionally included in ref . ) .",
    "hiii is equivalent to uhf , but with a saturated local moment .",
    "thus , with @xmath61 , the resultant cubic equation for @xmath43 on the @xmath1 bl , obtained from eqs ( [ 26],[27 ] ) above , coincides precisely with the hiii approximation for any @xmath3 ; see eg eq .",
    "( 34 ) of ref . .",
    "although hubbard s original formalism is very different , its physical content is that of a static approximation to an alloy analogy description @xcite ; a close relationship to uhf is thus to be expected .",
    "the second connection is to the falicov - kimball ( fk ) model @xcite , a simplified version of the hubbard model in which electrons of only one spin type are mobile , and which for @xmath1 is exactly soluble @xcite .",
    "for the paramagnetic phase of the fk model the single particle green function reduces precisely to that of hiii for any @xmath3 @xcite , ie to the above - mentioned cubic for @xmath43 on the @xmath1 bl ; see eg eqs ( 7.3 ) and ( 4.4 ) of ref . .    for the p phase , fig",
    "1 shows the uhf @xmath52 for @xmath54 on the @xmath1 bl , contrasted to its af counterpart . ordering or otherwise of the preformed local moments",
    "clearly has a significant effect on the spectra . in the af ordered case , for example",
    ", the interior edges of the hubbard bands have characteristic square - root divergences , while for the p phase all band edges vanish with square - root behaviour .",
    "more significantly , while the 2-sublattice structure of the nel ordered state ensures a band gap @xmath62 for all @xmath8 , the single - particle uhf gap vanishes in the p phase at a critical @xmath63 given by @xmath64 or correspondingly @xmath65 for hiii / fk signalling an insulator ",
    "metal transition .",
    "uhf / hiii fails of course in the metallic phase , there being no well - defined fermi surface or quasiparticles @xcite .",
    "this is inevitable for any inherently static approximation with a frequency - independent self - energy @xmath66 , since the essence of fermi liquid behaviour is the inelasticity of electron scattering near the fermi level , @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "however , even in the p insulating phase of interest here , uhf / hiii is deficient . as for the af",
    "this is seen most clearly in strong coupling , @xmath9 , where although the centres of the hubbard bands are separated by @xmath3 , each has a non - vanishing width . in the strong coupling p phase , and for the one hole ( doublon ) sector corresponding to the lower ( upper ) hubbard band , the hubbard model maps onto the @xmath10-@xmath11 model ( eq .",

    "note that this is also the single - particle bandwidth in the other extreme of the non - interacting limit , reflecting physically that in strong coupling the hole / doublon behaves essentially as a free particle @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the strong coupling bandwidth at uhf / hiii level is .",
    "w_^0=2 t _  :  uhf / hiii  . .",
    "uhf or hiii does not therefore give the exact strong coupling limit for the hubbard model , contrary to what has been suggested recently @xcite ; but , as is clear from the above discussion , gives instead the strong coupling limit of the fk model @xcite .",
    "the physical origin of eq .",
    "( [ 210]b ) is however both simple and revealing .",
    "consider again the upper hubbard band in strong coupling , and imagine adding an @xmath56-spin electron to a b - type @xmath17-spin site . within a static approximation such as",
    "uhf / hiii , only the added @xmath16-spin can hop ; and it can do so in the first instance to any of @xmath17-spin nn s ( b - type sites ) only the effective coordination number for which is @xmath68 .",
    "since @xmath69 for the propagating @xmath16-spin electron is reduced by a factor of 2 below the full coordination number , and since the bandwidth of the @xmath1 bl is proportional to @xmath70 , the strong coupling uhf / hiii width is thus diminished by @xmath71 from the corresponding non - interacting value which , as in eq .",
    "( [ 210]a ) above , is also the exact strong coupling limit ; eq .",
    "( [ 210]b ) thus results .",
    "the distinction between eqs ( [ 210]a ) and ( [ 210]b ) is however qualitative , and not solely a matter of degree , reflecting the need to take seriously even in strong coupling the _ correlated _ dynamics of the electrons .",
    "whenever , say , an @xmath16-spin electron is added to a site occupied by a @xmath17-spin electron , the added @xmath16-spin can indeed propagate in the p phase , scattering elastically off successive neighbouring @xmath17-spins ; and as sketched above this is well captured at uhf / hiii level .",
    "but , having added the @xmath16-spin to a @xmath17-spin site , the latter can itself clearly hop off the site to a neighbouring @xmath16-spin site leaving behind it a spin - flip on the original site .",
    "the energy cost for the spin - flip is zero , since we are considering the p phase where , for @xmath1 , a given spin is equally likely to be surrounded by @xmath16 or @xmath17 spins and has as many @xmath16 as @xmath17-spin neighbours ( whence there is no ` exchange penalty ' for a spin - flip ) .",
    "thus , whether the added @xmath16-spin or the @xmath17-spin already present hops off the site , the initially created doublon propagates as a free particle @xcite ; eq .",
    "( [ 210]a ) thus results . to describe correctly the electron dynamics , _",
    "both _ types of process above and therefore the interference between them must be included . a static approximation such as uhf / hiii can not handle this , since such dynamics reside in the frequency dependence of the full interaction self - energy @xmath72 , as considered in  3 .",
    "in contrast to single - particle spectra probing states one hole or particle away from @xmath2-filling rpa probes fluctuations about the mean - field state , and thus excitations of the @xmath2-filled state itself . for the insulating phases , with a gap to charge excitations , _ transverse _ spin excitations are of lowest energy .",

    "the @xmath10-@xmath183 spectrum is discrete , while for @xmath206 ( as in eq .",
    "( [ 315]b ) for the p phase ) the spectrum is continuous : the point @xmath206 thus corresponds to a transition from localized to extended single - particle excitations , and since @xmath207 as @xmath9 it is clear that @xmath208 is a singular point .    while the physical mechanism leading to delocalization of the hole at any finite @xmath3",
    "is not of course inherent in the @xmath10-@xmath183 model eq .",

    "at large but finite @xmath3 there is however a small but non - vanishing probability amplitude , of order @xmath209 , for an @xmath16-spin electron on a _ second _ nn site , also a - type , to hop to site @xmath37 via an intervening @xmath17-spin site : the hole thus moves two lattice spacings , to the second nn a - type site . unlike the `` @xmath10-@xmath183 processes '' above , this does not entail a spin - flip with concomitant exchange penalty : the hole moves freely .",
    "this mechanism evidently leads to hole delocalization and , in tandem with the @xmath10-@xmath183 processes , produces the strong coupling spectrum .",

    "it is these that embody the delocalization described above , and lead to spectral broadening ( contributions to re@xmath213 are @xmath173 and lead simply to residual energy shifts ) .",
    "further , note that since the energetic width of the spectral broadening is naturally the smallest energy scale in strong coupling , the principal effect on the ` bare ' @xmath10-@xmath183 spectrum is a small resonant broadening of the individual @xmath10-@xmath183 lines .",
    "this is seen in fig .",
    "8 , and becomes clearer still with further increasing @xmath3 .",

    "two further renormalizations have been performed to check the veracity of the above results .",

    "( [ 38]a ) , are themselves bare uhf propagators ; see fig . 2 . to ensure the theory is robust , we have thus additionally renormalized the single - particle lines entering @xmath220 in terms of both the ( self - consistent ) full green functions @xmath221 and the host green functions @xmath222 .",
    "the results in either case differ only quantitatively , and at low @xmath3 , from those just described ; see also below .",
    "the second renormalization concerns the local moment @xmath223 which , in the calculations above , has been set to its uhf value @xmath224 . in weak coupling ,",
    "van dongen @xcite has examined perturbatively the nel temperature and the moment magnitude @xmath223 ( the order parameter ) for the @xmath97 hypercubic lattice , and has shown that even for @xmath225 these are reduced by a factor @xmath226 of order unity ( @xmath227@xcite ) below their corresponding uhf values .",
    "the present theory is not of course perturbative ( eg the emergence of the af spin - flip scale is intrinsically non - perturbative ) , but it is certainly closer in spirit to van dongen to renormalize the moment beyond uhf level .",

    "it is apparent that the present theory belongs to a different universality class from that of hiii or its extensions .    in direct analogy to the af phase discussed in  3.3 , we have tested the robustness of our results by further self - consistently renormalizing single - particle lines in the polarization propagator @xmath305 ) that enters the self - energy kernel , eq .",

    "( [ 49a ] ) is itself renormalized to ensure that at each step of the self - consistent iteration scheme @xmath312 ( and we note that throughout the entire insulating regime , the resultant moment @xmath223 is also self - consistent in the sense of eq .",
    "( [ 317 ] ) to @xmath313 accuracy ) . the results of this further renormalization are found to differ negligibly from those we have reported above .    finally , to demonstrate the importance of the @xmath314 spin - flip scale",

    "( [ 38]b ) , retaining only @xmath315 ; and ( b ) replacing @xmath220 by @xmath306 in the self - energy kernel eq . ( [ 38]a ) .",
    "results obtained from ( a ) and ( b ) are very similar , but differ qualitatively from those reported above . in particular , although the self - energy remains @xmath171-dependent , the resultant critical behaviour is found to be that of hiii / hiii@xmath290 the gap closes continuously , but with an exponent @xmath299 .",
    "this points clearly to the necessity of including the @xmath314 spin - flip scale throughout the entire insulating phase : not only in achieving the correct strong coupling limit ( as in  3.2 ) , but also in describing the destruction of the insulating state .",
    "we now discuss the present work , particularly in relation to the iterated perturbation theory ( ipt ) approach @xcite , use and application of which has been extensive @xcite .",
    "although our theory of the mott - hubbard insulating phases , with its explicit emphasis on local moments , is conceptually and technically distinct from ipt , some general points of marked contrast are evident .    for the antiferromagnetic phase we have emphasized the importance of the @xmath94 spin - flip scale , inclusion of which is necessary to obtain even qualitatively reasonable results throughout essentially the entire range of interaction strengths , and in particular to recover exact strong coupling asymptotics",
    ". however ipt does not appear to capture the af spin - flip scale , presumably because it omits repeated particle - hole interactions of the sort shown in fig .",
    "2 ( which , as in  2.2a , are required to pick up the spin - flip ) .",
    "this is seen , for example , from the known inability of ipt to describe correctly the @xmath3-dependence of the nel temperature @xcite , particularly in the ` heisenberg ' regime .    for the paramagnetic insulator",
    ", the results of  4 also disagree qualitatively with those obtained from ipt ; see in particular and the review . within ipt",
    "the paramagnetic insulating solution is found to break down _ discontinuously _ ( at a critical @xmath316 , where the ipt gap @xmath317 ) , and @xmath282 ( eq . ( 4.10 ) ) remains _ finite _ at the transition .",
    "the same authors @xcite have recently examined the insulator via exact diagonalization ( ed ) on clusters of @xmath318 , 5 and 7 sites , extrapolated to @xmath319 assuming @xmath320 scaling behaviour .",
    "the resultant data suggest a continuous closure of the gap at a @xmath321 and are consistent with @xmath322 ; see also .",
    "further , and independently of the gap analysis , the behaviour of @xmath282 has also been examined by ed @xcite , noting ( see eq .",
    "( 4.10 ) ) that a divergence in @xmath282 implies a continuous closure of the gap : @xmath323 is found to show good scaling behaviour , and to scale to zero when @xmath324 is extrapolated to @xmath325 .",
    "the present theory evidently agrees with the inferences drawn from ed .",
    "these concur with our predictions (  4 ) that the gap closes continuously and with an exponent @xmath23 , that @xmath282 diverges , and ( less importantly ) the value of @xmath263 itself ; note moreover that the ed gap @xcite is in rather good agreement with the present work over a wide @xmath3 range .",
    "as described in  4 , inclusion of the @xmath18 spin flip scale is central in describing the destruction of the mott insulator .",
    "that ipt appears unreliable close to @xmath263 @xcite thus suggests an incomplete inclusion of the effects of this spin scale which can not be entirely absent since ipt does give the correct strong coupling spectrum @xcite although in physical terms the origin of the spin - flip scale within ipt is not transparent .    to conclude ,",
    "we have developed in this paper a theory for the @xmath0 mott - hubbard insulating phases of the @xmath97 hubbard model , encompassing both the antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic insulators . the microscopic perspective it affords hinges on the importance of low - energy scales for insulating spin - flip excitations .",
    "their existence is physically natural within the explicit local moment picture intrinsic to the theory , and inclusion of them is required not only to obtain the strong coupling limits of the single - particle spectra which are captured exactly but more generally to describe the entire insulating regimes , including for the paramagnetic phase in particular the destruction of the mott insulator .",
    "let us also note what we have not considered : the metallic state of the paramagnetic phase . but a glimpse of what is required to describe the metal within the present framework is evident from fig .",
    "12 . for @xmath326 ,",
    "close to the critical @xmath263 of  4 , this shows the spectral density of transverse spin excitations im@xmath114 ( here obtained , as described in  4 , with @xmath327 renormalized in terms of the @xmath309 ) .",
    "the @xmath110 spin - flip pole characteristic of the paramagnetic insulator is evident , and persists down to @xmath263 .",
    "clearly , however , the spectral edges of the stoner - like bands are themselves approaching @xmath110 .",
    "this they do at @xmath328 , and for @xmath329 in the metallic phase the insulating spin - flip _ pole _ at @xmath110 is replaced by a _ resonance _ at a small non - zero frequency @xmath330 , indicative of the kondo - like physics known to dominate the correlated metal @xcite .",
    "extension of the present approach to describe the metal , encompassing the kondo spin - scale in such a manner that the correlated state is correctly a fermi liquid , will be described in a subsequent paper .",
