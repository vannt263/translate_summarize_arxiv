    "finding a new solution of einstein field equations from a given solution of the same field equations has a long history and mathematically is related to the problem of finding a solution to a set of nonlinear partial differential equations from another known solution . here",
    "we make use of a very special transformation introduced by ehlers [ 1 ] through which one could start from a static spacetime and end up with a stationary solution .",
    "we apply this transformation to two static spacetimes , namely schwarzschild metric and morgan - morgan disk space [ 2 ] and in the meantime employ the concepts introduced in the gravitoelectromagnetic approach ( 1 + 3 formalism ) to spacetime decomposition to yield a physical interpretation of the spacetime found through the transformation .",
    "the use of the gravitoelectromagnetic concepts are justified by the fact that the main equation of the ehlers transformation includes the gravitomagnetic potential of the stationary spacetime .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce briefly gravitoelectromagnetism and the ehlers transformation and use the latter to derive , as an example , the nut solution [ 3 ] from schwarzschild spacetime and also chazy - curzon - nut ( cc - nut ) solution from chazy - curzom static metric [ 4,5 ] . in section iii",
    "we introduce briefly the static morgan - morgan disk space ( without radial pressure ) and some of its properties . in section iv using ehlers transformation we find the corresponding stationary spacetime representing the spacetime of a finite disk of mass @xmath0 and gravitomagnetic charge @xmath1 . in section v we discuss some of the properties of this stationary disk including its particle velocity distribution , gravitational redshift , stability and energy conditions . in the last section",
    "we summarize the results obtained .",
    "the @xmath2-decomposition ( threading ) of a spacetime by a congruence of timelike curves ( observer worldlines ) leads to the following splitting of the spacetime interval element [ 6 ] ; @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are defined to be _ the invariant spatial and temporal length elements _ of two nearby events respectively .",
    "they are constructed from the normalized tangent vector @xmath6 to the timelike curves in the following way ; @xmath7 @xmath8 where @xmath9 is called the _ projection tensor_. taking @xmath10 and @xmath11 , equations ( 1 ) and ( 4 ) can be written in the following alternative forms ; @xmath12 using the _ preferred coordinate _ system in which the timelike curves are parameterized by the coordinate time @xmath13 of the comoving observers ; @xmath14 and the above spatial and spacetime distance elements will take the following forms [ 6,7 ] ; @xmath15 @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 introducing @xmath19 and @xmath20 as the _ gravitoelectric _ and _ gravitomagnetic _ potentials respectively , their corresponding fields are . ] [ 7 ] ; @xmath21 @xmath22 where the differential operators are defined in the @xmath23 space . on the other hand ehlers transformation , also called _ gravitational duality rotation _",
    ", in its original form states that if @xmath24 with @xmath25 representing the _ conformal _ spatial distance , is the metric of a static exterior spacetime , then , @xmath26 ( with @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) would be the metric of a stationary exterior spacetime provided that @xmath30 satisfies the following equation ; @xmath31},\\eqno(15)\\ ] ] where @xmath32 , @xmath33 being the conformal spatial metric . hereafter we call the above equation the ehlers equation .",
    "+ considering the ehlers transformation and in particular ehlers equation ( 15 ) in the context of gravitomagnetism , then finding a stationary solution corresponding to a given static solution , amounts to finding the gravitomagnetic potential @xmath30 related to a given static ( potential ) function @xmath19 . in what follows , as an example of the procedure",
    ", we derive the nut space [ 8 ] as the stationary spacetime with a radial gravitomagnetic field which is the gravitational dual of schwarzschild space .      starting from the schwarzschild mertic in the form ( 13 ) in which ; @xmath34 and",
    "@xmath35 we find that in this case the ehlers equation ( 15 ) reduces to , @xmath36 in which we set @xmath37 to keep the resulted spacetime single valued and axially symmetric . using ( 16 ) the gravitomagnetic field",
    "is found to be , @xmath38 so the resulted stationary metric is given by ( 14 ) as ; @xmath39 where @xmath40 this is the well known nut space [ 3,11 ] .",
    "to recover the schwarzschild spacetime metric as @xmath41 we need @xmath42 now applying the following changes of variables and redefinitions of constants ; @xmath43 to the line element ( 20 ) we have , @xmath44 which is the nut space in its more common form [ 8,11,12 ] . note that having started from a potential with @xmath45 ( or @xmath46 )",
    "we would have ended up with the _ pure _ ( @xmath47 ) nut space . in other words",
    "although adding the constant @xmath48 in the static case does not correspond to a different spacetime , in the ehlers transformation it does .",
    "this actually answers another question of concern , namely , what is the seed metric ( in ehlers transformation ) of pure nut space ? . by the above argument for both nut and pure nut spaces the seed metic",
    "is the schwarzschild metric .      as another example of the application of the ehlers transforemation in this section we consider a family of solutions for a gravitomagnetic potential of the form @xmath50 ( in the spherical or the schwarzschild - type coordinates @xmath51 ) which according to the @xmath52 formalism [ 7 - 9 ] could , in principle , produce stationary spacetimes with gravitomagnetic field components @xmath53 and",
    ". using ehlers transformation one could easily show that for an @xmath55 of the type ( 25 ) one ends up with the equation @xmath56 for @xmath19 with the general solution [ 11 ] @xmath57 for the simplest case , i.e. @xmath58 we have @xmath59 which , in the static case corresponds to the chazy - curzon metric [ 4,5 ] and in the stationary case ( through ehlers transformation ) to a spactime dual to chazy - curzon with a gravitomagnetic potential of the form @xmath60 [ 13,14 ] .",
    "it is notable that this has exactly the same form as the gravitomagnetic potential of nut space and consequently the parameter @xmath61 could be interpreted as the nut factor ( or magnetic mass ) .",
    "another example in which ehlers transformation is examined on a static spacetime to yield an stationary space is the case of _ cylindrical _ nut space [ 15 ] where it is shown that it could be obtained from levi - civita s static cylindrically symmetric solution .",
    "static axially symmetric spacetimes in the weyl canonical coordinates are given by the following general form [ 11 ] ; @xmath62 - e^{2u}dt^2 , \\eqno(33)\\ ] ] in which @xmath19 and @xmath63 are functions of @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "morgan and morgan [ 2,11 ] found the following solution for a finite disk ( of mass @xmath0 and radius @xmath66 ) without radial pressure in terms of the oblate ellipsoidal coordinates @xmath67 ; @xmath68 ( 3\\eta^2 - 1)\\right),\\eqno(34)\\ ] ] and @xmath69,\\eqno(35)\\ ] ] where @xmath70,\\eqno(36)\\ ] ] in which the connection between the ellipsoidal @xmath71 and weyl @xmath72 coordinates ; @xmath73 . in [ 16 ]",

    "exact thin disk solutions of einstein field equations are discussed extensively in different contexts in the literature .",
    "the above static solution , first derived by morgan and morgan [ 2 ] , is considered to represent the spacetime of a finite disk of counterrotating particles .",
    "properties of static counterrotating disks have been studied in [ 17,18 ] .",
    "superposition of a central black hole with a surrounding thin disk of counterrotating particles is discussed in [ 19 ] and infinite self - similar counterrotating disks were studied in [ 20,21 ] . in the following section using the ehlers transformation we obtain the stationary spacetime corresponding to the morgan - morgan static disk space . to our knowledge the exact nut extension of the above morgan - morgan disk space has not appeared in the literature .",
    "starting with the morgan - morgan static disk space given by equations ( 34 - 36 ) and using the fact that @xmath77 we write ( 34 ) as follows @xmath78 p_2(\\eta)\\right)+c.\\eqno(40)\\ ] ] now choosing an axially symmetric gravitomagnetic potential @xmath79 , by ehlers transformation we have ; @xmath80 @xmath81 where @xmath61 is the ehlers transformation parameter ( duality rotation parameter ) and @xmath66 is the radius of the disk with mass @xmath0 . since the right hand sides of the above two equations include legendre polynomials @xmath82 and",
    "@xmath83 we can expand the gravitomagnetic potential as follows ; @xmath84 by substituting the above potential into the equations ( 41 ) and ( 42 ) we end up with the following solution for the gravitomagnetic potential ; @xmath85 + c_1 , \\hspace{.75 in } ( 44)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where as before @xmath86 is the nut factor . to regain the morgan - morgan space as @xmath87",
    ", we choose @xmath88 where @xmath89 , so that the line element of the stationary spacetime of a finite disk with mass m and magnetic mass ( nut factor ) @xmath1 is given by ; @xmath90 ^ 2   \\\\       & - &   a^2({l^2\\over 4m^2}e^{2u}+e^{-2u})\\left(e^{2k } ( \\xi^2 + \\eta^2)({d\\xi^2\\over 1+\\xi^2 } + { d\\eta^2\\over 1-\\eta^2 } ) + ( 1+\\xi^2)(1-\\eta^2)d\\phi^2 \\right).\\hspace{.4in}(45)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this is verified to be an exact solution to the vacuum einstein field equations using the maple tensor package . as the original morgan - morgan disk space is asymptotically flat , it is not difficult to see that the above stationary spacetime shares the same property",
    ". hereafter we call the above solution the mm - nut disk space",
    ". the presence of the dirac - type ( nut - type ) singularity could be inferred from the form of the gravitomagnetic potential ( 44 ) , as one could not make it vanish simultaneously for both the positive ( @xmath91 ) and negative ( @xmath92 ) half - axes ( @xmath93 ) by any choice of the constant @xmath94 . in other words only half of the axis",
    "could be made regular , either the positive half - axis ( for @xmath95 ) or the negative half - axis ( for @xmath96 ) .",
    "therefore a shrinking loop around the singular half - axis will have a non - zero circumference even when @xmath97 . now consider a @xmath98 hypersurface and take the lower half - axis ( @xmath99 ) to be singular ( i.e. @xmath95 ) . in this case the coefficient of @xmath100 in ( 45 ) becomes positive at sufficiently small @xmath64 ( @xmath101 ) ; hence @xmath102 becomes a timelike coordinate and being a cyclic variable with a period of @xmath103 , this means that the spacetime contains _ closed timelike curves _ in the singular section ; another characteristic of nut - type singularity .",
    "in this section we calculate particle velocity distribution of the mm - nut ( stationary ) disk found in the previous section .",
    "we also discuss its stability and energy conditions and obtain the gravitational redshift suffered by the photons emitted from different radii on the disk .",
    "hereafter we take a disk with unit radius i.e. we set @xmath104 for convenience",
    ".      the general form of the metric for stationary axially symmetric spacetimes ( in cylindrical coordinates ) is given by ; @xmath105 for a zero angular momentum observer ( zamo ) in these spacetimes , the velocity of a particle in a circular motion ( in the @xmath106 plane ) , is given by [ 22 ] ; @xmath107 therefore we need to find @xmath108 , for which , we use the energy - momentum tensor of the particle distribution which in turn could be calculated by the formalism of distributions [ 19,23 ] . using the general form of the energy - momentum tensor of a system of particles [ 7 ] , @xmath109 and the fact that @xmath110 we end up with the folowing final result ; @xmath111 in which , through the einstein field equations , the components of the energy - momentum tensor are given by , plane ) are given by @xmath112 ] @xmath113\\delta(z),\\eqno(50)\\ ] ] where @xmath114 are the components of the discontinuity in the first derivative of the metric tensor ( at @xmath115 ) , @xmath116 computing these elements for the metric ( 45 ) we have ; @xmath117 @xmath118 @xmath119 where @xmath120 and @xmath121^{3\\over 2})^2 .",
    "\\eqno(56)\\ ] ] now substituting ( 52 - 56 ) into ( 50 ) and use the outcome in ( 49 ) and ( 47 ) we obtain the follwoing expression for the particle velocity , @xmath122 where @xmath123 for the disk to be physical we impose the condition that the velocity of the particles at the rim of the disk do not exceed that of the light i.e. , @xmath124 imposing the above constraint in its extreme form ( i.e. with the equal sign ) on ( 57 ) , we find the following relation between @xmath1 and @xmath0 @xmath125 and consequently the following constraint on the maximum value of the disk mass , @xmath126 for @xmath127 .",
    "this is a higher maximum value for the disk mass compared to that obtained by morgan and morgan [ 2 ] , @xmath128 in other words , addition of the nut factor as an extra parameter , not only changes the static character of the spacetime ( to stationary ) but also allows for a higher mass of the disk to be acceptable physically .",
    "note that this maximum value of mass is obtained for a negative value of @xmath1 which , by the form of the metric ( 45 ) , is acceptable . in fig .",
    "1 the diagram of @xmath1 in terms of of @xmath0 , given by the constraint ( 60 ) , is shown and only those pair of values @xmath129 inside the loop formed by the @xmath130 and @xmath131 curves are acceptable physically . for a fixed disk mass @xmath0 the velocity of particles as a function of radius is shown in fig . 2 for different values of @xmath1 .",
    "having discussed the velocity distribution of the disk particles one could also discuss stability of particle orbits under radial perturbations .",
    "to do so we use the extended rayleigh criterion of stability under radial perturbations given by [ 23,24 ] , @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the angular momentum of disk particles . for circular geodesics in @xmath115 plane the specific angular momentum is given by ; @xmath134 substituting for @xmath135 from ( 49 ) it could be seen that @xmath136 is an increasing function of @xmath64 and satisfies the above criterion leading to the stability of circular orbits ( fig .",
    "since we have already confined the domain of the allowed values of @xmath1 and @xmath0 to those respecting the velocity of light barrier , it is expected that the same domain of values respect the energy conditions as well .",
    "this is indeed the case for strong and weak energy conditions as we will see below but not for the dominant energy condition . to consider the energy conditions for mm - nut disk space we diagonalize the stress - energy tensor to find the principal pressures [ 23 ] .",
    "the eigenvalue equation for the stress - energy tensor ; @xmath137 constitutes the following eigenvalues @xmath138 where @xmath139 it could be easily checked that for the discriminant @xmath140 the eigenvalues @xmath141 are the azimuthal pressure @xmath142 and energy density @xmath143 respectively [ 23 ] . in our case , using the non - zero components of the energy - momentum tensor ( 50 ) , the discriminant , @xmath144 ^ 2\\over [ l^2 e^{({3\\pi m \\over 4}(2-\\rho^2 ) ) } + 4m^2 e^{({3\\pi m \\over 4}(2-\\rho^2))}]^4}. \\eqno(68)\\ ] ] is positive definite and the strong energy condition ( sec ) , @xmath145 is always satisfied . on the other hand the weak energy condition ( wec ) and the dominant energy condition ( dec ) could be written equivalently as the following conditions on the magnitude of the gravitomagnetic charge @xmath1 , @xmath146 @xmath147 it could be seen that the most restricted situation happens at the rim of the disk , so , to ensure the above conditions all over the disk we apply them at @xmath148 i.e. , @xmath149 @xmath150 in fig .",
    "4 the dec , wec and velocity conditions are shown in a diagram for the same range of values of @xmath1 and @xmath0 as in fig .",
    "it is noted that the wec is already satisfied by those values of @xmath1 and @xmath0 respecting the velocity condition , but dec could be violated for some values of @xmath1 and @xmath0 already allowed by the velocity condition and vice versa .",
    "we also note from ( 73 ) that , for the static morgan - morgan disk ( @xmath151 ) , dec is equivalent to the velocity condition , in other words , the maximum allowed mass is given by @xmath152 as in ( 62 ) .      using the usual formula for the gravitational redshift in an asymptotically flat spacetime , for the mm - nut disk space ( which is asymptotically flat ) we have , @xmath153",
    "it is seen that the largest redshift occurs for an emitter at the centre of the disk ; @xmath154 which compared to the morgan - morgan disk has the extra @xmath1-dependent term in the right hand side . in fig .",
    "5 redshift of photons emitted from the center of the disk in terms of nut parameter for two different disk masses are given .",
    "we note from the above discussions that in general for each value of @xmath0 there is a range of allowed values of @xmath1 and indeed in fig .",
    "5 the masses and their corresponding nut parameters are chosen such that all are physically acceptable .",
    "in this article using the ehlers transformation as a tool for finding a stationary spacetime from a static spacetime and the @xmath52 approach to spacetime decomposition which yields a physical interpretation of the stationary spacetime in terms of the concepts introduced under the general name of gravitomagnetism , we found the stationary spacetime of a finite disk dual to the static spacetime of a non - rotating disk ( without radial pressure ) introduced by morgan and morgan [ 2 ] .",
    "the exact form of this metric , which we called mm - nut disk space , is given in oblate ellipsoidal coordinates in ( 45 ) .",
    "the axially symmetric nature of the spacetime and the form of the gravitomagnetic potential ( 44 ) , infers a gravitomagnetic field with components along the polar directions @xmath64 and @xmath155 .",
    "the fact that we find the extra parameter of the spacetime in the combination @xmath156 suggests that the parameter @xmath61 could be interpreted as the gravitomagnetic monopole charge per unit mass .",
    "it is shown that the mm - nut stationary disk admits , through the introduction of the nut factor , a higher maximum disk mass than the static morgan - morgan disk for a negative value of @xmath1 .",
    "it is found that this spacetime is singular either in the positive or the negative half axis , leading to the existence of closed timelike curves ( ctcs ) in the singular sector .",
    "we also showed that mm - nut disk has stable particle orbits and satisfies the strong energy condition .",
    "the weak energy condition on the other hand holds as long as the values of mass and nut parameter are such that the particle velocities do not exceed that of light .",
    "interesting enough , it is shown that the dominant energy condition could be violated for some values of @xmath1 and @xmath0 which respect the velocity barrier condition and vice versa . also as a by - product and as an example of the application of the ehlers transformation",
    ", we showed that the seed metric for both nut and pure nut ( @xmath47 ) spaces is the schwarzschild metric .",
