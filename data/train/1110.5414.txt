    "the qualitative behavior of the apex s speed is similar to that reported by charras et al .",
    "the diameter of the neck evolves non - monotonically with time : the sudden localized dissociation of one vertex from its six neighboring strands causes an imbalance of forces on the six neighboring vertices leading to their displacement outward and then an increase of the size of the strands in the ablation region .",
    "meanwhile , this is accompanied by a compression of the overall csk , demonstrated by a decrease in the average length of csk strands . after the initial brief expansion of the neck , during which the bleb has a shape of a cap , the neck starts to retract .",
    "the onset of retraction of the csk strands in the neck region coincides with the transition of the bleb s shape to that of a bud .",
    "interestingly , this transition roughly coincides with a slowing down in the growth rate of the bleb s apex .",
    "we associate this slowing down to the fact that the net current of lipids flowing into the bleb is proportional to the perimeter of the neck .",
