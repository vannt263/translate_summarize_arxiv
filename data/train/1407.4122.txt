    "cataclysmic variables are defined as short - period semi - detached binary stars in which a white dwarf , the primary star , accretes matter via a gas stream and an accretion disc from a donor star , the secondary .",
    "secondary stars are usually low - mass near - main - sequence stars with rare exceptions where the secondary evolved via nuclear processes . a bright spot is formed by shock - heating where the matter stream impacts the accretion disc .",
    "an accretion disc can not be formed in magnetic cvs with highly magnetized white dwarfs in which matter transfer occurs through accretion channels and columns . for comprehensive reviews of cvs ,",
    "see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .    as the orbital period ( @xmath10 ) is the most precisely determined observational parameter for cvs , properties of the orbital period distribution can be easily examined .",
    "the orbital period gap between roughly 2 and 3 h @xcite and a sharp cut - off at about 80 min , period minimum @xcite , are the most striking features of the cv period distribution .",
    "since this distribution is a useful indicator of dynamical evolution of the systems , most studies on the evolution of cvs are mainly concentrated on the explanation of the orbital period distribution .",
    "the standard cv formation and evolution theory successfully explains the orbital period gap and the period minimum , since its predictions on the orbital period gap and the period minimum are supported by observations @xcite .",
    "it should be stated that the evolution of magnetic cvs may be different from non - magnetic cvs @xcite .",
    "in addition to the orbital period distribution , spatial distributions and kinematical analysis could be important to test evolutionary scenarios and their predictions , as the data obtained from stellar statistics must be in agreement with the proposed evolutionary schemes @xcite .",
    "although it is hard to measure the radial velocity variation of a cv and such measurements are affected by the other components and activity level of the system , stellar statistics could give more reliable results depending on the completeness of the samples @xcite .",
    "however , observational selection effects are usually strong , and even a rough estimate of galactic model parameters such as space density and scaleheight obtained from the stellar statistics may be crucial to constrain the evolutionary models @xcite .",
    "for example , observations of cvs and predictions from cv population models give space densities @xmath11 pc@xmath9 @xcite and @xmath12 pc@xmath9 @xcite , respectively . although there is a rough agreement between the observed and predicted space densities , the wide range of the observational values is striking . similarly , the observed luminosity function @xcite of cvs can give clues on evolution and mass distribution as a function of the orbital period . regarding the exponential scaleheight of cvs , @xcite and @xcite found 190@xmath1330 pc and 160 - 230 pc , respectively , while @xcite adopted 120 , 260 and 450 pc for long , for normal short orbital period systems and for period bouncers , respectively , for modeling the galactic population of cvs .",
    "@xcite concluded that scaleheight of cvs is very likely larger than the 190 pc found by patterson ( 1984 ) .",
    "it should be noted that previous measurements for the scaleheight of cvs were made from the samples which are strongly biased towards bright objects . that is why @xcite argued that the 190 pc used by @xcite can be suitable only for youngest cvs .",
    "however , @xcite found from a large sample of cvs including both short and long orbital period systems that the exponential scaleheight is 158@xmath1314 pc for the 2mass ( two micron all sky survey ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath0-band limiting apparent magnitude of 15.8 which was set by authors to obtain a complete sample",
    ".    disagreements of the galactic model parameters in various studies of cvs could originate from selection effects and inadequate numbers of systems with reliable distances , which are encountered in almost all cases @xcite . with the exception of @xcite ,",
    "previous galactic model parameters of cvs were derived from the samples for which distances were estimated using various methods . as the first step of deriving galactic model parameters and a luminosity function is to collect truthful distances of systems in a selected sample , it is crucial to find a single method for estimating cv distances .",
    "near - infrared photometric methods proposed by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite could allow researchers to collect a fairly homogeneous sample of cvs regarding the distances .",
    "all three methods are based on the barnes - evans relation @xcite which states that the surface brightness of the late - type main - sequence stars , such as the secondary stars in cvs , in near - infrared is nearly constant .",
    "an important advantage of these methods is the use of magnitudes measured in the near - infrared wavelengths for which the interstellar absorption is much weaker than that in the optical wavelengths .",
    "several studies to estimate cv distances using the barnes - evans relation have been done @xcite .",
    "@xcite express that the method proposed by @xcite works best overall for all cvs , an expected result as the plcs relation in @xcite is calibrated by the trigonometric parallaxes which is the most reliable distance estimation method .",
    "a new relation similar to ak et al.s ( @xcite ) plcs relation may be re - constructed using the near - infrared 2mass and mid - infrared @xmath3 ( wide - field infrared survey explorer ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) photometries together that comprise a wide range of wavelengths .",
    "such a new relation must be calibrated using corrected @xmath14 parallaxes @xcite and new or re - measured trigonometric parallaxes of cvs @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that absolute magnitudes of the secondary stars in cvs can not be directly calculated from the plcs relation .",
    "although almost all flux in near and mid - infrared comes from the secondary star in a cv @xcite , it is clear that outer parts of the accretion disc or circumbinary dust can contribute to the total infrared flux of the system .",
    "the aim of this paper is to derive the galactic model parameters and luminosity function of cvs in the solar neighbourhood . as the distance is the key parameter for such a study , we first obtain in section 2 a new plcs relation using @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2-band magnitudes in 2mass and @xmath3 photometries and @xmath10 of cvs with new or re - measured trigonometric parallaxes in order to collect a homogeneous sample of cvs regarding to distances .",
    "section 3 includes the estimation of the galactic model parameters of cvs in a sample collected from ritter @xmath15 kolb s ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* edition 7.20 ) ) catalogue .",
    "also , a discussion of the completeness of the sample and the analysis regarding to space distribution and luminosity function are given in section 3 .",
    "we compare and discuss the results of this study in section 4 .",
    "the data sample used in construction of the new plcs relation consists of cvs in table 1 including their classes , orbital periods ( @xmath10 ) , trigonometric parallaxes ( @xmath16 ) , relative parallax errors ( @xmath17 ) , 2mass @xmath0 and @xmath1 magnitudes and @xmath3 @xmath2 magnitudes .",

    "the near - infrared @xmath0 and @xmath1 magnitudes of cvs in this calibration sample were taken from the point - source catalogue and atlas @xcite which is based on the 2mass observations .",

    "coordinates of the systems taken from @xcite and @xmath3 database were matched with 2mass images in aladin sky atlas .",
    "@xmath3 is an infrared space telescope with much higher sensitivity than previous survey missions ( wright et al . , 2010 ) .",
    "the @xmath3 space telescope surveyed the entire sky from 2010 , january 14 to 2010 , july 17 in four mid - infrared bands ( 3.4 , 4.6 , 12 and 22 @xmath18 m ) .",
    "these bands are denoted as @xmath191 , @xmath192 , @xmath193 and @xmath194 with the angular resolutions 6.1 , 6.4 , 6.5 and 12 arcsec , respectively .",
    "@xmath3 goes one magnitude deeper than the 2mass @xmath1-band magnitude in @xmath191 for sources with spectra close to that of an a0 star and even deeper for moderately red sources like k - type stars @xcite .",
    "note that secondary stars in cvs are near , but not necessarily identical to , g - k - m type main - sequence stars @xcite .",
    "systems listed in table 1 have orbital periods 82.4 @xmath20(min ) @xmath21 720 as cvs with @xmath22 720 and @xmath23 82 min have secondaries on the way to becoming a red giant @xcite and a degenerate star @xcite , respectively .",
    "although the cvs in the calibration sample are relatively close to the sun , the total interstellar absorption in the direction of the system in question should be taken into account .",
    "for the determination of the total absorption for @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2-bands , the equations of @xcite and @xcite were used , respectively , i.e. @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 . here ,",
    "@xmath27 is adopted @xcite .",
    "colour excesses @xmath28 were obtained from the schlafly & finkbeiner s ( @xcite ) maps , which is based on the maps of @xcite , by using the nasa / ipac extragalactic database .",
    "as the colour excesses @xmath28 in the directions of the stars are actually given up to the edge of the galaxy by the @xcite maps , reduction of @xmath28 values from the maps according to the actual distance of each system in the calibration sample and estimation of the total interstellar absorption in the photometric band used were done as described in @xcite . after computing total interstellar absorptions @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 in the direction of the star , the de - reddened colours @xmath32 and @xmath33",
    "were obtained from @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "once de - reddened @xmath0-band apparent magnitudes and distances @xmath37 were obtained for the cvs in the calibration sample , their @xmath0-band absolute magnitudes were easily calculated from the well - known pogson s equation , i.e. @xmath38 . the calculated @xmath39 values are given in table 1 .",
    "the data of the 36 systems in table 1 were collected to derive an absolute magnitude calibration , the plcs relation , for cvs . by checking standard deviations and correlation coefficients of the fit equations , after trying various colours and equation forms ,",
    "we preferred to use a fit equation in the following form to find the dependence of the absolute magnitude @xmath39 on the orbital period @xmath10 and colours @xmath32 and @xmath33 :    @xmath40    however , as can be seen from table 1 , the relative parallax errors @xmath17 of some cvs are too high and these systems must not be taken into account in the least square fit procedure .",
    "thus , we preferred to exclude cvs with relative parallax errors @xmath41 0.5 from the calibration sample in table 1 .",
    "these systems are tt ari , lx ser , hx peg , rx and , rw sex and qu car . in addition , we found using the data in the aavso ( american association of variable star observers ) archive that the 2mass colour indices of ss cyg and su uma shift to smaller values during outburst and superoutburst activities , respectively .",
    "for this reason , we also removed ss cyg and su uma from the calibration sample . during the regression analysis , mq dra , ir gem and vy aqr",
    "were also removed from the calibration sample due to high scatter .",
    "it is known that low accretion rate polars like mq dra have lower luminosities compared to cvs with a similar orbital period @xcite .",
    "the mass of the white dwarf in ir gem is somewhat higher than those in cvs whose orbital periods are near this system s orbital period .",
    "thus , the irradiation of the secondary star by the white dwarf in ir gem could be higher than in other cvs near its orbital period @xcite .",
    "regarding vy aqr , various studies assigned different spectral types to the secondary star in this system @xcite . consequently , 25 systems remained in the calibration sample .",
    "a least square fit gives the coefficients and their @xmath131@xmath42 errors listed in table 2 .",
    "the correlation coefficient and standard deviation of the calibration were calculated as @xmath43 and @xmath44 mag , respectively .",

    "studies based on the deep sky surveys showed that scalelength of the thin - disc stars is larger than 2.6 kpc @xcite .",
    "an inspection of the electronic table shows that the distances of 95 per cent of cvs in the sample are smaller than 1 kpc .",
    "this implies that almost all cvs in the sample should be members of the thin - disc component of the galaxy .",
    "thus , they were not classified according to the population types and estimation of scalelength of cvs were not attempted .",

    "it should be noted that the number of novae in the sample is too small to draw firm conclusions .",
    "since the exponential function represents the vertical distribution of all cvs in the sample better , a comparison of @xmath65 with @xmath63 for the model distribution produced using this function reveals that there are 30@xmath138 cvs hiding in the solar vicinity .",

    "<S> in order to determine the spatial distribution , galactic model parameters and luminosity function of cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) , a @xmath0-band magnitude limited sample of 263 cvs has been established using a newly constructed period - luminosity - colours ( plcs ) relation which includes @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2-band magnitudes in 2mass and @xmath3 photometries , and the orbital periods of the systems . </S>",
    "<S> this cv sample is assumed to be homogeneous regarding to distances as the new plcs relation is calibrated with new or re - measured trigonometric parallaxes . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis shows that the scaleheight of cvs is increasing towards shorter periods , although selection effects for the periods shorter than 2.25 h dramatically decrease the scaleheight : the scaleheight of the systems increases from 192 pc to 326 pc as the orbital period decreases from 12 to 2.25 h. the @xmath4-distribution of all cvs in the sample is well fitted by an exponential function with a scaleheight of 213@xmath5 pc . </S>",
    "<S> however , we suggest that the scaleheight of cvs in the solar vicinity should be @xmath6300 pc and that the scaleheights derived using the sech@xmath7 function should be also considered in the population synthesis models </S>",
    "<S> . the space density of cvs in the solar vicinity is found 5.58(1.35)@xmath8 pc@xmath9 which is in the range of previously derived space densities and not in agreement with the predictions of the population models . the analysis based on the comparisons of the luminosity function of white dwarfs with the luminosity function of cvs in this study show that the best fits are obtained by dividing the luminosity functions of white dwarfs by a factor of 350 - 450 .    ,    </S>",
