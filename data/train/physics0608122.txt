    "in recent years , high order harmonic generation ( hohg ) from atom and molecule has been the subject of numerous experimental and theoretical studies , mainly because the emission of high - order harmonics is a promising method to produce coherent x rays and attosecond pulses , and an effective ways to study the internal construction of atom or molecule@xcite .",
    "compared to atom case , the hohg spectrum of molecule systems demonstrates novel properties , e.g. , peak splitting and sideband peaks , rabi or mollow triplets effect , and combination of the atomic - like and molecular - like plateau , molecular alignment effect , and two - center interference , to name only a few@xcite .",
    "symmetric molecular system such as @xmath0 have pairs of electronic states known as the charge - resonance ( cr ) states , ( i.e.,@xmath1,@xmath2 . )",
    "it is known that the cr states are strongly coupled to electromagnetic fields at large internuclear separation @xmath3 .",
    "bandrauk and co - worker first pointed out the importance of these cr states as sources of highly nonlinear laser - induced effects in molecules@xcite .",
    "ivanov , corkum examined the possibility of using the cr states to produce and coherently control hohg@xcite .",
    "zuo , chelkowski , and bandrauk have showed that symmetric molecular ions in general produce more efficient harmonic generation than atoms , especially at large @xmath3 , due to these cr states@xcite . however , in the all above discussions , the theoretical analysis is based on a two - level model where the continuum ( ionization ) states are ignored completely . since the ground - continuum coupling and ionization become important for the strong laser fields of @xmath4 and above , a fully understanding of the whole structure of hohg and the effect of cr states in molecule systems requires to extend to consider the continuum states and ionization process .",
    "in present paper we develop an analytic theory on the harmonic generation of symmetric diatomic molecular ions beyond the two - level model .",
    "our model is capable to produce harmonic structure for the whole range of harmonic order , including the molecular plateau due to cr transition and the atomic - like plateau for a long - wavelength excitation , and agrees well with the numerical results from directly solving the schrdinger equation .",
    "our theory identifies the role of the cr states in the fine structure of harmonic spectrum and shows that the harmonic generation in molecular system can be effectively controlled through cr states by adjusting the internuclear distance .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    "we present our analytical theory .",
    "our analysis is divided into two cases : near - resonance region of intermediate internuclear distance and the strong - coupling region of large internuclear distance .",
    "we will derive the time - dependent amplitudes of the ground , excited and continuum states , then calculate dipolar moments and their fourier transformation .",
    "the analytic expressions of the amplitudes of hohg for the whole range of harmonic order is given in this section .",
    "sec.iii presents our numerical results .",
    "our theory is applied to 1d symmetric diatomic molecule model , making analysis on the structure of hohg and compare with the results from directly solving schrdinger equation .",
    "sec.v is our conclusion .",

    "comparison between fig.1 ( a ) and fig.1(c ) shows that while the external field becomes stronger and although the ground states and the first excited state depletion in fig.1(c ) is only @xmath189 , there is very large difference between @xmath168 time - dependent exact calculation and two - level calculation .",
    "so the continuum state effects on spectrum must be considered in this case .",
    "otherwise , an obvious characteristic , different from atom , for the population of molecule states is the strong - coupling of the ground state and the first excited state .",
    "it shows that it is necessary and reasonable to consider the first excited state effect on harmonic generation to explain the spectrum from symmetrical diatomic molecular ions .    while @xmath190 , the ionization potentials of the ground state and the first excited state are @xmath191 and @xmath192 , respectively .",
    "the energy separation is @xmath193 , which is in the strong - coupling region .",
    "when @xmath194 , and the depletion of ground states and the first excited state is only @xmath195 .",
    "fig.2(b ) exhibits harmonic - generation efficiencies of at least four orders of magnitude greater than that of fig.2(a ) .",
    "it is worth it to be noted that both odd and even harmonic peaks appear although the even harmonic is weak in fig.2 , which accords with our above analysis that with the increasing internuclear separation @xmath3 , the rabi splitting of the odd harmonics should converge towards even harmonics and their intensity should become weaker and weaker . again",
    "the calculation result also shows the strong - coupling of the ground state and the first excited state .",
    "fig.3(a ) and ( c ) show the hohg spectra from the @xmath168 time - dependent calculation and the numerical calculation of the formula ( 14 ) with @xmath3=@xmath196 and assuming the system initially being in the ground state .",
    "fig.3(b ) and fig .",
    "3(d ) show the fine structure of fig.1(a ) and fig.3(c ) , respectively .",
    "the splitting separation is @xmath197 in fig.3(b ) and @xmath198 in fig.3(d ) .",
    "the discrepancy is due to invalidation of rotating - wave approximation in intense field .",
    "a plateau in low - order region is also identifiable in the spectrum in fig.3(c ) with a cutoff at the 5th harmonic order , which agrees with fig.3(a ) .",
    "this corresponds to the maximum energy acquired by the electron in the two - level system in the presence of the field@xcite .",
    "furthermore , a second plateau up to the @xmath199 harmonic order which is associated with the ground - continuum coupling ( referred to as the atomic plateau ) can be identified .",
    "the cutoff position of the atomic plateau can be well explained by a semiclassical model@xcite .",
    "fig.4 shows the hohg spectra from @xmath168 time - dependent numerical calculation and ( 14 ) with @xmath3=@xmath180 and @xmath200 the total depletion of the ground states and the first excited state is @xmath201 .",
    "the splitting separations is @xmath202 in fig.4(b ) and @xmath203 in fig.4(d ) .",
    "the position of cutoff in fig.4(c ) is at the @xmath204 harmonic order that agrees with the order @xmath205 , the cutoff law predicted by the semiclassical mechanism of hohg .",
    "fig5 shows the comparison of the splitting separation(scaled by the frequency @xmath7 with @xmath184 ) between the model prediction of @xmath54=@xmath206(solid curve ) and the @xmath168 time - dependent exact calculation ( dotted curve ) at @xmath3=@xmath196(fig5(a ) ) and @xmath3=@xmath180(fig5(b ) ) .",
    "it is obvious that in the near resonance case(fig5(a ) ) , good agreement is obtained while the field is weak .",
    "however while the field becomes stronger , the difference between the theory one and the numerical one seems smaller in fig5(b ) than in fig5(a ) with the same field intensity .      at intermediate @xmath3 , such as @xmath3=@xmath196 or @xmath3=@xmath180 ,",
    "no matter initially the system is in the ground state or the first excited state , or the coherent superposition state , no distinct difference is found in the spectra from numerical calculations .",
    "however at large @xmath3 , the case is rather different .",
    "fig.6 shows the comparison of harmonic generation spectrum calculated from different initial condition at @xmath3=@xmath207 , where @xmath208 and @xmath209 . in fig.6(b ) , where the system initially is in the coherent superposition state , even harmonics appear although they are weaker than the odd harmonics , however in fig6(a ) , where the system initially is in the ground state , even harmonics hardly are distinguishable .",
    "the result validates our analysis for ( 20 ) , which predicts that at large @xmath3 if the system initially is in the ground state , only odd harmonic can be produced , and if it is in the coherent superposition state , even harmonics also should be emitted although their strength should be weaker than the odd ones .",
    "if initially the system is in the excited state , the case is analogous with the ground state .",
    "other calculations at @xmath3=@xmath181 from different initial conditions also show similar result .",
    "the position of cutoff in fig.6(c ) is at the @xmath210 harmonic order , which agrees with the order @xmath205 .    at intermediate @xmath3 , with the same parameters as in fig4 , fig.7 shows the comparison of contributions to harmonic from the four different terms ( 10)-(13 ) .",
    "it can be seen that all of them give equivalent contribution to hohg in this case .    at large @xmath3 , with the same parameters as in fig6(a ) , fig.8 shows the comparison of contributions to harmonic from the four different terms ( 16)-(19 ) if initially the system is in the ground state .",
    "it is the term of @xmath32 that contributes mostly to hohg in the case .",
    "similarly , the calculation also shows that if initially the system is in the first excited state , the primary contribution to hohg should come from @xmath38 .",
    "fig.9 shows the spectra calculated by our analytic theory and @xmath168 numerical simulation with @xmath3=@xmath211 .",
    "the main difference is that there are weak even harmonic peaks in fig.9(a ) but no even harmonic peaks in fig.9(a ) .",
    "this is because @xmath212 has been adopted in the analytic formulation but actually these two states are not completely degenerated .",
    "the position of cutoff in fig.9(b ) is at the @xmath213 harmonic order , which agrees with the order @xmath214 that is obtained by the semiclassical calculation considering complex trajectories .",
    "this is consistent with the finding that at very large @xmath3 , the molecule has different cutoff law @xcite .",
    "in summary , with considering the continuum states and ionization , the photon - emission spectra of the symmetric diatomic molecule ions in intense laser fields are thoroughly investigated and the role of the cr states is identified .    in the near - resonance region ( @xmath40 ) , it is shown that the multiple mollow triplet structure can be described by an analytic theory based on rotating - wave approximation and the rabi oscillation between the ground state and the first excited state induces the symmetrical splittings of odd harmonics . the splitting separation in weak field",
    "can be approximately denoted by @xmath54=@xmath215 .    in the strong coupling region ( @xmath128 ) , all of the symmetrical splitting sidebands of odd harmonics gradually converge to even harmonics and their amplitudes get weaker and weaker with the increasing internuclear separation @xmath3 . this is explained by our theory in the ultimate condition of @xmath216(@xmath127 ) .",
    "an interesting phenomenon is that in this case if initially the system is in the coherent superposition of the ground state and the first excited states , there are stronger even harmonics emitted than only in the ground or first excited state , and their intensity depends on the value of @xmath217 .    in all above cases , the molecular plateau and the atomic plateau are identifiable in the analytical model and the cutoff positions are accordant with the numerical simulation and semiclassical calculation .",
    "we also find that , for the symmetrical diatomic molecule , the dipole movement includes four terms , those are @xmath32 , @xmath34 , @xmath36 and @xmath38 , respectively , denoting the transitions from the ground state or the first excited state to the continuum state , then back to the ground state or the first excited state .",
    "it is more complicated than atom case because of the existence of the @xmath218 states . at intermediate @xmath3 ,",
    "each process contributes equivalently to molecular hohg .",
    "however , at very large @xmath3 , their contributions depend on the initial condition .",

    "<S> in present paper we develop an analytic theory for the harmonic generation of symmetric diatomic molecular ions beyond two - level model , emphasizing the influence of charge - resonance ( cr ) states those are strongly coupled to electromagnetic fields for large internuclear distance . </S>",
    "<S> with taking into account the continuum states that is ignored in the two - level model and become important for intense laser case , our model is capable to produce spectrum for the whole range of harmonic orders consisting of a molecular plateau due to the cr transition and an atomic - like plateau for a long - wavelength excitation , and in good agreement with numerical results from directly solution of the schrdinger equation . </S>",
    "<S> our theory also identifies the crucial role of the cr states in the fine structure of harmonic spectrum and shows that the harmonic generation in molecular system can be effectively controlled by adjusting the internuclear distance . </S>"
