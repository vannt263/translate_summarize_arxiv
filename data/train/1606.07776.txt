    "<S> using the concepts of slow sound and of critical coupling , an ultra - thin acoustic metamaterial panel for perfect and omnidirectional absorption is theoretically and experimentally conceived in this work . </S>",
    "<S> the system is made of a rigid panel with a periodic distribution of thin closed slits , the upper wall of which is loaded by helmholtz resonators ( hrs ) . </S>",

    "<S> the ability to perfectly absorb an incoming wave field in a sub - wavelength material is advantageous for several applications in wave physics as energy conversion @xcite , time reversal technology @xcite , coherent perfect absorbers @xcite or soundproofing @xcite among others . </S>",
    "<S> the solution of this challenge requires to solve a complex problem : reducing the geometric dimensions of the structure while increasing the density of states at low frequencies and finding the good conditions to match the impedance to the background medium .    </S>",
    "<S> a successful approach for increasing the density of states at low frequencies with reduced dimensions is the use of metamaterials . </S>",
    "<S> recently , several possibilities based on these systems have been proposed to design sound absorbing structures which can present simultaneously sub - wavelength dimensions and strong acoustic absorption . </S>",
    "<S> one strategy to design these sub - wavelength systems consists of using space - coiling structures @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another way is to use sub - wavelength resonators as membranes@xcite or helmholtz resonators ( hrs ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , a new type of sub - wavelength metamaterials based on the concept of slow sound propagation have been used to the same purpose . </S>",
    "<S> this last type of metamaterials @xcite makes use of its strong dispersion for generating slow - sound conditions inside the material and , therefore , drastically decreasing frequency of the absorption peaks . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the structure thickness becomes deeply sub - wavelength . </S>",
    "<S> all of these structures , however , while they bring potentially solutions to reduce the geometric dimensions , face the challenge of impedance mismatch to the background medium .    </S>",
    "<S> the interaction of an incoming wave with a lossy resonant structure , in particular the impedance matching with the background field , is one of the most studied process in the field of wave physics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these open systems , at the resonant frequency , are characterized by both the leakage rate of energy ( i.e. , the coupling of the resonant elements with the propagating medium ) , and the intrinsic losses of the resonator . the balance between the leakage and the losses activates the condition of critical coupling , trapping the energy around the resonant elements and generating a maximum of energy absorption @xcite . in the case of transmission systems , degenerate critically coupled resonators with symmetric and antisymmetric resonances should be used to perfectly absorb the incoming energy by trapping the energy in the resonant element , i.e. without reflection neither transmission @xcite . in the case of purely </S>",
    "<S> reflecting system , either symmetric or antisymmetric resonances that are critically coupled can be used to obtain perfect absorption of energy by a perfect trapping of energy around the resonators @xcite .        in this work , using the concepts of slow sound and critical coupling , we theoretically and experimentally report a prefect and omnidirectional absorbing metamaterial panel with deep sub - wavelength thickness . as shown in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> the hrs , of square cross - section , are characterized by a neck and a cavity widths @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and lengths @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively </S>",
    "<S> . the presence of the hrs introduces a strong dispersion in the slit producing slow propagation , in such a way that the resonance of the slit is down shifted : the slit becomes a deep sub - wavelength resonator . </S>",
    "<S> the visco - thermal losses in the system are considered in both the resonators and in the slit by using effective complex and frequency dependent parameters @xcite . therefore , by modifying the geometry , the intrinsic losses of the system can be efficiently tuned and the critical coupling condition can be fulfilled to solve the impedance matching to the exterior medium .    </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : scheme](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> periodic boundary conditions are assumed at boundaries @xmath10 and @xmath11 . at this stage </S>",
    "<S> we have to notice that through this work several theoretical models are used to analyze the structure : a full modal expansion model ( mem ) , its low frequency approximation that gives the effective parameters , an approach based on the transfer matrix method ( tmm ) and the finite element method ( fem ) ( see supplementary material for more details of the models ) . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig : n3 ]  ( a ) shows the real part of the phase velocity in the slit , calculated both in the lossless and lossy cases , for a metamaterial with parameters @xmath12 mm , @xmath13 cm , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 cm , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig : n3 ]  ( b ) shows the corresponding dispersion relation , where a band gap can be observed above the resonant frequency of the hrs , @xmath19 . due to the presence of this band gap , </S>",
    "<S> slow propagation conditions are achieved in the dispersive band below @xmath19 . in the lossless case , </S>",
    "<S> zero phase velocity can be observed for frequencies just below @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> note also that the maximum wavenumber inside the slit is limited by the discreteness to the value @xmath20 , as shown by the tmm calculations ( dashed blue curve in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : n3](b ) ) . in the lossy case , </S>",
    "<S> the losses limit the minimum value of group velocity @xcite , but in our system slow sound velocity can be achieved in the dispersive band below @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> the average sound speed in the low frequency range is much lower ( 50 m / s ) than the speed of sound in air . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the collective resonances produced by the array of hrs will be in the deep sub - wavelength regime compared with the length , @xmath21 , of the slit .        the resonant scattering problem analyzed in this work can be characterized by the reflection coefficient . a simple way to obtain this reflection coefficient </S>",

    "<S> the reflection coefficient has pairs of zeros and poles that are complex conjugates one from another in the lossless case . in the @xmath42 sign convention , </S>",
    "<S> the zeros are located in the positive imaginary plane . </S>",
    "<S> the imaginary part of the complex frequency of the poles of the reflection coefficient represents the energy leakage of the system into the free space@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> once the intrinsic losses are introduced in the system , the zeros of the reflection coefficient move downwards to the real frequency axis@xcite . for a given frequency , </S>",
    "<S> if the intrinsic losses perfectly balance the energy leakage of the system , a zero of the reflection coefficient is exactly located on the real frequency axis and therefore perfect absorption , @xmath43 , can be obtained . </S>",
    "<S> this condition is known as critical coupling @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig : n3 ]  ( c ) shows the absorption predicted by the different models when the geometry of the system has been tuned to introduce the exact amount of intrinsic losses that exactly compensates the energy leakage of the system at 275 hz for @xmath44 . in this situation , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : n3 ]  ( d ) , the lower frequency zero is located on the real axis , leading to a peak of perfect absorption . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , as we have @xmath44 resonators , other two secondary peaks of absorption are observed at higher frequencies , e.g. 442 hz and 471 hz . </S>",
    "<S> their corresponding zeros are located close to the real axis and , although the critical coupling condition is not exactly fulfilled , high absorption values can be observed at these frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> the differences between the several model predictions observed in the absorption coefficient are due to the fact that the effect of the discreteness is not captured by neither the mem or its effective parameters . </S>",
    "<S> mem leads to an infinite number of zeros and poles close to the resonance , producing the artificial increase of the absorption observed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : n3 ]  ( c ) near @xmath19 . consequently , the prediction of absorption by mem is accurate only if these zeros do not interact with the real axis or if the number of resonators is considerably increased . </S>",
    "<S> the tmm captures this discreteness effect and shows good results in this range of frequencies ( 400 - 500 hz ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the previous sample provides perfect absorption for a thickness of @xmath45 . using an optimization method ( sequential quadratic programming ( sqp ) method@xcite ) the geometry of the system can be tuned in order to minimize the thickness of the material , providing structures with perfect absorption and deep sub - wavelength dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> the tmm was employed in the optimization to consider the discreteness effects on the reflection coefficient . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting structure from the optimization procedure is shown in figure .  </S>",

    "<S> the maximum absorption measured experimentally was @xmath61 , as shown in the inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : n1 ]  ( b ) . </S>",
    "<S> this small discrepancy between the measurements and the models can be caused by experimental reasons including the non perfect fitting of the slit on the impedance tube and the excitation of plate modes of the solid medium that composes the metamaterial .    </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : n1 ]  ( c ) shows the corresponding reflection coefficient in the complex frequency plane calculated with mem . </S>",
    "<S> the color map corresponds to the case in which the critical coupling condition is fulfilled , i.e. , the zero of the reflection coefficient is exactly located on the real frequency axis . </S>",
    "<S> as long as the intrinsic losses depend on the geometry of the resonators and the thickness of the slits , we also represent in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : n1 ]  ( c ) the trajectory of this zero as the geometry of the system is modified . </S>",
    "<S> the crossing of the trajectories with the real frequency axis implies that perfect absorption can be achieved with this system at this particular frequency . </S>",
    "<S> it can be seen that the trajectories linked to the resonators geometry , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 have a strong effect in the real part of the complex frequency of the zero , as they modify the hrs resonant frequency . in the case of @xmath8 , due to the geometric constraint @xmath62 </S>",
    "<S> , increasing the length of the neck implies also the reduction of the cavity and the trajectory of the zero is twisted . </S>",
    "<S> the trajectory of the slit thickness , @xmath1 , shows that the intrinsic losses are excessively increased for very narrow slits and critical coupling condition can not be fulfilled . </S>",
    "<S> for very wide slits the geometrical constraints also imply the reduction of the size of the resonators and therefore the resonant frequency is increased . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the trajectory linked to the lattice size , @xmath5 , shows how the depth of the slit , @xmath63 , is mainly linked to the intrinsic losses of the system : the peak absorption frequency is almost independent of @xmath5 , it mostly depends on the resonator resonant frequency . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , as the slow - sound conditions are caused by the local resonance of the hrs , the periodicity of the array of hrs is not a necessary condition for these perfect absorbing panels . </S>",
    "<S> however , considering periodicity allows us to design and tune the system using the present analytical methods .    finally , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : n1 ]  ( d ) shows the absorption of the metamaterial panel as a function of the angle of incidence . </S>",
    "<S> it can be observed that almost perfect absorption is obtained for a broad range of angles , being @xmath64 for incident waves with @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> the inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : n1 ]  ( d ) shows the absorption in diffuse field@xcite calculated as @xmath66 , where at the working frequency it reaches a value of @xmath67 , showing the omnidirectional behavior of the absorption in this sub - wavelength structure .    </S>",
    "<S> realistic panels for sound perfect absorption with sub - wavelength sizes are designed in this work with simple structures made of bricks with helmholtz resonators . </S>",
    "<S> perfect absorption of sound is achieved at 338.5 hz with a panel thickness of @xmath68 cm and without added porous material . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth noting here that the total panel size in the vertical dimension is also sub - wavelength @xmath69 cm . </S>",
    "<S> the sub - wavelength feature of the presented structure provides perfect absorption for a wide range of incident angles . </S>",
    "<S> this omnidirectional sound absorber can be employed in practical applications where the omnidirectional feature is mandatory . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , several theoretical approaches have been presented and validated experimentally , where their limits of validity are discussed . in order to provide accurate models , </S>",
    "<S> we have presented the design with standard helmholtz resonators . </S>",
    "<S> however , the thickness of the structure can be even reduced by engineering the geometry using coiled - up channels or embedding the neck into the cavity of the hrs . </S>",
    "<S> these promising results open the possibilities to study different configurations based on these metamaterials and to extend the results to broadband and omnidirectional perfect absorption with deep sub - wavelength structures .    </S>",
