    "the multiquark states have been intriguing subjects of researches to study the infrared aspects of qcd beyond those manifested in the usual hadron spectra .",
    "one of the conventional approaches from qcd is to analyze correlators of multiquark currents , which is related to the hadronic spectral functions through the dispersion relation . compared to analyses for usual meson and baryon correlators ,",
    "the multiquark cases are expected to have the following difficulties : ( i ) the complications associated with the many - body system , which make the calculation of correlators much involved .",
    "( ii ) the decays into usual hadrons , whose backgrounds contaminate the signal from multiquark states",
    ". we will show that the use of @xmath0 expansion @xcite greatly reduces both difficulties , and , more importantly , enables to make logically clear statements @xcite .",
    "we perform the correlator analyses using the borel transformed qcd sum rules ( qsr ) for the hadronic correlators @xmath3 @xcite : @xmath4 where lhs is calculated by the operator product expansion ( ope ) and rhs is the integral of the hadronic spectrum . here",
    "@xmath5 characterizes the scale of momentum flow between interpolating fields , and @xmath6 is factorization scale separating high energy calculable part and low energy condenstate part .",
    "usually we are interested in the ground state properties of rhs in eq.([qsr ] ) , and they can be investigated by taking small @xmath7 due to the exponential factor @xmath8 .",
    "but we can not take arbitrarily small @xmath7 value since the ope is basically expansion of @xmath9 and is violated in small @xmath7 region .",
    "thus we must take intermediate region where the integral is well - saturated by ground state contribution and the ope is well - converged .",
    "these are quantified as : pole contribution @xmath10 50% of the total @xcite ( for upperbound @xmath11 ) and highest dimension terms @xmath12 10% of whole ope ( for lowerbound @xmath13 ) .",
    "practically , without these @xmath7 constraints , we will be stuck with the _ pseudo - peak _ artifacts leading to wrong conclusions , as discussed in @xcite .    keeping these constraints in mind ,",
    "let us consider how the first difficutly ( i ) is manifested in the qsr analyses .",
    "the multiquark correlators involve many quark lines , sharing only small fraction of the momentum with a scale relevant to the multiquark states . as a result",
    ", we have to incorpolate more non - perturbative diagrams in the ope calculations than usual hadron analyses , to include relevant low energy correlations . otherwise , we can not find the @xmath7 window due to the lack of sufficient low energy contributions .",
    "here we shall add one remark about the low energy dominance . in the case of multiquark correlator analyses",
    ", it is frequently said that the pole - dominace is spoiled by large continuum ( or high energy part of spectrum ) contributions peculiar to multiquark correlators @xcite .",
    "this is a somewhat misleading expression .",
    "a real problem in the early studies is the lack of low energy correlation .",
    "in fact , in certain tetraquark correlators , inclusion of higher dimension terms enables to take sufficiently small @xmath7 value , achieving the low energy dominance not much worse than usual meson sum rules , and even better than baryon sum rules @xcite .",
    "thus we conclude that a relevant problem is numerical ambiguities in values of higher dimension condensates .    the second difficulty ( ii ) peculiar to multiquark cases arises as follows : even if we take into account the sufficient low energy correlations , they might be contributions from scattering backgrounds which are ground states in most of multiquark correlators .",
    "this prevents us from investigating the multiquark states of our interests .",
    "both difficulties seem profound . however , as we will show",
    ", leading @xmath1 properties of multiquark states are tractable and , in principle , the corrections to them can be treated step by step with identifying origins of contaminations .",
    "in this section , we discuss how useful @xmath0 expansion is in the application of the qsr .",
    "the first merit is presented in the evaluation of the higher dimension condensates .",
    "it is well - known that in large @xmath1 they can be factorized into the products of known condensates , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 .",
    "thus we can extend the ope calculations to sufficiently higher dimension terms needed to include relevant low energy contributions . here",
    "we must make one assumption on the @xmath1 scaling of these low dimension condensates . since @xmath17(@xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath16 ) are known to be @xmath20 , we simply assume @xmath21 .    next , we discuss how to separate the scattering background from the multiquark correlators .",
    "the point is that @xmath1 counting of the quark - gluon graphs is directly related to the qualitative picture of hadronic states .",
    "we will show that with taking appropriate interpolating fields , the multiquark state and background can be assigned in the different order of @xmath1 , and their mixing occurs only in the higher order of @xmath0 than those studied in this work .",
    "then we can concentrate on the quark - gluon graphs which are saturated by the _ isolated _ poles which reflect leading @xmath1 properties of multiquark states .    to make discussions concrete",
    ", we consider the @xmath2 meson with @xmath22 as a candidate of the tetraquark ( 4q ) state .",
    "the 4q operators with the @xmath2 quantum number are given ( assuming the ideal mixing for the @xmath2 meson ) by @xmath23 as products of meson operators @xmath24 , where dirac matrix @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the pauli matrices acting on @xmath27 .",
    "let us start the @xmath0 classifications of quark - gluon graphs in the 2-point correlators , graphs ( a)-(c ) in fig.[fig:2pointgraph ] , where planar - gluon lines are not explicitly drawn .",
    "the leading @xmath1 diagrams start from fig.[fig:2pointgraph ] a ) , which include only 2 planar loops and thus reflect irrelevant free 2-meson scattering states .",
    "this indicates that the studies of 4q components require systematic steps beyond the leading @xmath28 .",
    "thus we must proceed to the next leading order of @xmath29 , @xmath20 diagrams which could include the multiquark states .     and",
    "@xmath20 quark - gluon diagrams for 2 and 3 point correlators.,width=491,height=90 ]    [ fig:2pointgraph ]    for systematic classifications , it is useful to first investigate the overlap strength of the operator @xmath30 with hadronic states by @xmath0 , then to use them in the classification of subleading diagrams of 2-point correlators . for this purpose , we consider the 3-point correlator among @xmath30 and two separated @xmath31 ( fig.[fig:2pointgraph ] , d - f ) .",
    "simple calculations indicate that the overlap strength of the 4q field with 2 meson states is @xmath32 since the leading order diagrams are @xmath33 ( @xmath20 ) for @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) and the overlap strength of @xmath36 with 2q meson state @xmath37 is @xmath38 ) @xcite .",
    "now we can classify the hadronic states in 2-point correlators @xmath39 based on @xmath29 ( see , fig.[fig:2pointgraph ] , a - c ) : ( a ) if @xmath34 , @xmath33 quark - gluon graphs include only the free 2 m scattering states in the region @xmath40 . if @xmath35 , the contributions from these quark - gluon diagrams vanish , indicating the absence of free 2 meson scattering states .",
    "( b ) @xmath20 graphs include the 2 m or 2m scattering and could include 4q poles .",
    "note that if @xmath41 are different from pseudoscalar or axial vector , 2@xmath42 scattering intermediate states are not included up to @xmath20 diagrams .",
    "interactions are needed to transfer initial states into the @xmath43 intermediate states , but such interactions are suppressed by @xmath0 .",
    "then the resonance peaks ( if exist ) _ below _",
    "@xmath44 are _ isolated and have no width _ since the decay channels are absent at this order .",
    "therefore , now we can reduce the @xmath2 spectrum in the 4q correlator into peak(s ) plus continuum _ if we retain only diagrams up to @xmath20 _ for the appropriate currents .",
    "we will study these cases .",
    "this separate investigation of the @xmath33 and @xmath20 parts enables to perform the step by step analyses for each hadronic state .",
    "we relate the ope , _ term by term of @xmath0 _ , to the _ integral _ of the hadronic spectral function through the dispersion relation : @xmath45 the ground state in the reduced @xmath20 spectra @xmath46 can be described as the sharp peak due to the absence of the decay channels . applying the usual quark - hadron duality to the higher excited states , @xmath47 , and taking the moment of borel transform of eq.([disp ] )",
    ", we can express the effective mass as @xmath48 @xmath49 can be uniquely fixed to satisfy the least sensitivity @xcite of the expression ( [ eq : peakmass ] ) against the variation of @xmath5 , since the physical peak should not depend on the artificial expansion parameter @xmath5 .",
    "this criterion is justified only when the peak is very narrow , and our @xmath0 reduction of spectra is essential for its application to allow the qsr framework to determine all physical parameters ( @xmath50 ) in a self - contained way .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     in this section , we show the results of borel analyses .",
    "we concentrate on the @xmath20 results of the off diagonal correlator @xmath51 , whose leading order is @xmath20 thus without the factorization violations at the @xmath20 ope . the ope is carried out up to dimension 12 .",
    "the numerical analyses are performed with the values for @xmath52 case , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 , respectively .",
    "most results shown below will use the central value .",
    "first we show in the left panel of fig.[fig : borelfig ] the results of the large @xmath1 2q correlators ( expanded up to dimension 6 ) for the vector meson as a reference and the scalar meson as the 2q state in the @xmath2 meson .",
    "the downarrow ( upperarrow ) indicates the values of @xmath13 ( @xmath57 ) . following the @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) fixing criterion",
    ", we fix @xmath58 to 1.0 ( 1.4 ) gev for vector ( scalar ) mesons , and determine the mass as 0.65 ( 1.10 ) gev .",
    "now we turn to the @xmath20 part of the 4q correlator , @xmath51 , to investigate the possiblity of 4q states . shown in the middle panel of fig.[fig : borelfig ] are the effective masses for @xmath58=1.0 , 1.2 , and 1.4 gev .",
    "we select the @xmath58=1.2 gev case and evaluate the mass as @xmath600.90 gev , which is obviously lower than that of the 2q scalar meson case , @xmath601.10 gev in large @xmath1 limit , and thus is considered as the mass of 4q state . although these absolute values depend on the details of condensate values , the inequality @xmath61 is insensitive to them . in the right panel of fig.[fig : borelfig ] , we show the @xmath62 and @xmath63 dependence of 2q vector , scalar meson masses , and of the 4q mass deduced from @xmath51 .    we have also investigated both @xmath33 and @xmath20 parts of @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) . as for @xmath33 part",
    ", low energy contribution is almost absent below two meson thresholds .",
    "more precisely speaking , acceptable effective mass plots can be obtained only if we take much larger @xmath58 value than the two meson thresholds , giving large effective masses .",
    "this indicates that @xmath33 part includes only free scattering states consistently with @xmath0 arguments . as for @xmath20 part ,",
    "@xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) give similar values @xmath66 gev , as @xmath51 case , despite of the possible factorization violation in the formers .",
    "we have also investigated 4q correlators with @xmath67 .",
    "they do not allow us to find any stable effective mass plots or any reasonably wide @xmath7 window .",
    "this would indicate the absence of 4q pole in @xmath67 channel , consistenly with experimental observations .    in conclusion",
    ", it is found that the @xmath0 expansion is very useful to analyze the leading @xmath1 properties of multiquark states with separating scattering backgrounds .",
    "the qsr results show consistencies with expectations from @xmath0 arguments , and further provide the prediction on 4q components in the @xmath2 meson without @xmath68 correlations .",
    "the leading @xmath1 analyses for multiquark correlators may be also useful to distinguish two meson molecules and tetraquarks , which is discussed for the recently found charmed mesons ( x , y , z ) .",
    "since initial states are controled by interpolating fields , and @xmath0 countings give observations on intermediate states , the combination of them enables to separate the molecular type contributions in the spectral functions .",
    "further discussions will be made elsewhere .",
