    "the standard model ( sm ) of the electroweak ( ew ) interactions has been developed mostly in the 1960s , where the gauge group @xmath0 was suggested  @xcite , the higgs mechanism for spontaneously broken gauge theories developed , and the model for leptons constructed explicitly  @xcite .",
    "subsequently , key predictions of the sm were observed in the 1970s , including neutral currents and parity non - conservation in atoms and in deep - inelastic electron scattering ( dis )  @xcite .",
    "the basic structure of the sm was established in the 1980s after mutually consistent values of the weak mixing angle , @xmath1 , were determined from many different processes .",
    "the 1990s saw the highly successful @xmath2-factories , lep and slc , and the confirmation of the sm at the loop level .",
    "it thus became clear that any new physics beyond the sm could at most be a perturbation .",
    "the previous decade added precision measurements in the neutrino and quark sectors ( including a 0.5% measurement of the top quark mass  @xcite ) , as well as ultra - high precision determinations of the @xmath3-boson mass , @xmath4 ( to @xmath5 )  @xcite , the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon  @xcite , and the fermi constant , @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "these results suggest that the new physics must be separated by at least a little hierarchy from the ew scale unless one considers the possibility that a conspiracy is at work .",
    "the current decade will elucidate the ew symmetry breaking sector at the lhc and witness a new generation of experiments at the intensity frontier with sensitivities to the multi - tev scale and beyond .",
    "the next section reviews some recent developments in slightly more detail .",
    "interpretations of these and other results for the mass of the higgs boson , @xmath7 , and new physics , are discussed , respectively , in the two sections thereafter .",
    "the mulan collaboration at the psi in switzerland  @xcite has measured the @xmath8-lifetime to parts - per - million precision , @xmath9 , which translates into a determination of @xmath10 the higgs vacuum expectation value is given by @xmath11  gev .",
    "this measurement is so precise that even the error in the definition of the atomic mass unit ( u ) can shift @xmath6 ( mulan quotes @xmath12 ) .",
    "moreover , it is so precise that the effect of the finite @xmath4 in the w - propagator is no longer negligible .",
    "one may either choose to correct for it , _",
    "i.e. , _ absorb it in @xmath13 defined through @xmath14 , or else not to do so  @xcite , _",
    "i.e. , _ absorb it in @xmath15  @xcite defined in terms of the accurately known fine structure constant , @xmath16 , and @xmath2-boson mass , @xmath17 , @xmath18 the latter convention is motivated by an effective fermi theory point of view , and used by mulan and since this year also by the pdg  @xcite .",
    "what @xmath19 is to @xmath6 is the @xmath20-lifetime to the strong coupling constant , @xmath21 .",
    "at least one low - energy @xmath21-value is needed to promote the @xmath2-width and related @xmath2-pole observables from a quantitative measurement in qcd to an ew sm test ( or to constrain physics beyond the sm ) .",
    "perturbative qcd has recently been extended to 4-loop order  @xcite , but there is a controversy whether the perturbative series should be truncated , _",
    "i.e. _ , fixed order perturbation theory ( fopt ) should be used  @xcite , or whether higher order terms from the running strong coupling in the complex plane should be re - summed in what is called contour - improved perturbation theory ( cipt )  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , fopt and cipt appear to converge to different values .",
    "there are also non - perturbative contributions parametrized by condensate terms which can be constrained by experimentally determined spectral functions .",
    "there are two different approaches  @xcite which at present give very similar numerical results . using fopt and the condensates from ref .",

    "the two values can be seen to agree perfectly .",
    "the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon was measured to extreme precision , @xmath23 by the bnl ",
    "e821 collaboration  @xcite .",
    "the prediction , @xmath24 , from the sm includes @xmath25 as well as @xmath20-decay data in the dispersion integral needed to constrain the two- and three - loop vacuum polarization contributions and differs by @xmath26 .",
    "the data based on @xmath20-decays requires an isospin rotation and a corresponding correction to account for isospin violating effects and suggests a smaller ( @xmath27 ) discrepancy , while the @xmath25-based data sets ( from annihilation and radiative returns ) by themselves would imply a @xmath28 conflict .",
    "indeed , there is a @xmath29 discrepancy between the experimental branching ratio , @xmath30 , and its sm prediction using the @xmath25 data  @xcite . in view of this , it is tempting to ignore the @xmath20-decay data and blame the difference to the @xmath25 data on unaccounted for isospin violating effects .",
    "however , there is also a @xmath31 experimental conflict between kloe and babar ( both using the radiative return method  @xcite ) the latter not being inconsistent with the @xmath20-data .",
    "the above results include an additional uncertainty from hadronic 3-loop light - by - light scattering diagrams which contribute , @xmath32  @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the 95% cl upper bound , @xmath33 , found in ref .",
    "one may point out that if the three dominant errors from experiment ( @xmath34 ) , hadronic vacuum polarization ( @xmath35 ) and light - by - light scattering ( @xmath36 ) can be pushed below @xmath37 , then a @xmath38 discovery would be established ( if the central value persists ) .",
    "the nominal @xmath39 error is already there , but it is also the hardest to defend .    as for the question whether the deviation in @xmath40 may arise from physics beyond the sm ( especially supersymmetry  @xcite ) ,",
    "my personal take is that i am less concerned about these hadronic issues than the absence of convincing new physics hints at the tevatron or the lhc .",

    "the bright ( yellow ) bands are excluded by one experiment and the remaining ( black ) regions are ruled out by more than one experiment . ]",
    "the most precise derived and purely ew precision observable is no longer the @xmath2-pole combination of @xmath45 , but rather @xmath46 gev from the cdf and d  collaborations at the tevatron  @xcite which is dominated by a @xmath47  mev determination by cdf using only 2.2  fb@xmath48 of their data .",

    "the prospects for the full 10  fb@xmath48 dataset are a @xmath52  mev @xmath4 determination from cdf alone , even when no reduction of the parton distribution function ( pdf ) ( @xmath53  mev ) and qed ( @xmath54  mev ) uncertainties is assumed . in the most optimistic scenario ,",
    "cdf could shrink the error to @xmath53  mev , which is to be compared with the @xmath55  mev accuracy expected from a threshold scan at a future international linear collider .",

    "values of @xmath44 are also often quoted from @xmath57 , @xmath58 or @xmath59 , which are combinations of @xmath60-dis and @xmath61-dis neutral - current ( nc ) and charged - curent ( cc ) cross sections , @xmath62 it should be cautioned , however , that @xmath44 is affected very differently by variations of @xmath7 and by physics beyond the sm than the quantities defined in eq .",

    "various sm effects have been suggested , such as an asymmetric strange sea , isospin violation ( both , from qed splitting effects  @xcite and through the pdfs  @xcite ) , or nuclear effects ( _ e.g. _ , the so - called isovector emc effect  @xcite ) , as well as qed  @xcite , qcd  @xcite and ew  @xcite radiative corrections .",
    "we stress that the precise impact of these effects need to be evaluated carefully by the collaboration with a new and self - consistent set of pdfs , including new radiative corrections , while simultaneously allowing isospin breaking and asymmetric strange seas .",

    "@xmath71 is similar to the weak charges of heavy nuclei measured in atomic parity violation ( apv ) but at a different kinematics .",
