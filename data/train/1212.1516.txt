    "the su uma stars are dwarf novae in short orbital periods that show two distinct types of outbursts : a short normal outburst with a duration of a few days , and a long superoutburst with a duration of typically two weeks [ see , @xcite and @xcite for dwarf novae in general and for su uma stars in particular ] . in ordinary su uma stars , several short normal outbursts are sandwiched between two long superoutbursts , and a cycle from one superoutburst to the next is called a supercycle .",
    "normal outbursts are believed to be essentially the same as those outbursts observed in ordinary dwarf novae with a longer orbital period , such as u gem and ss cyg stars ; they are now well understood by considering the thermal limit - cycle instability in the accretion disk ( see , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) . during the superoutburst ,",
    "periodic humps , called the superhumps , always appear with a period slightly longer than the orbital period by a few percent .",
    "the superhump phenomenon is now well understood by considering the tidal instability ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) ; superhumps are produced by a periodic tidal stressing of the eccentric precessing accretion disk , which is in turn produced by the tidal 3:1 resonance instability between the accretion - disk flow and the orbiting secondary star .",
    "( 160mm,100mm)fig1.eps    as to the superoutburst and supercycle of su uma stars , three different models have so far been proposed : the thermal - tidal instability model advocated by osaki , the enhanced mass - transfer model advocated by smak , and the pure thermal instability model by cannizzo . no consensus has yet been reached about the cause of the superoutburst .    besides the original planet hunting mission , nasa s kepler observations @xcite with high - accuracy photometry",
    "give an unprecedented opportunity to investigate variable stars .",
    "two su uma stars , v344 lyr and v1504 cyg , in the kepler field have been observed with the short cadence ( sc ) mode , and some of their light curves are now available to the public . in this paper",
    ", we consider the cause of the superoutburst in su uma stars using the kepler light curve of one of them , v1504 cyg , in section [ sec : keplerv1504cyg ] .    before",
    "going into our study of kepler data , we first review three models for superoutbursts and supercycles of su uma stars in section [ sec : models ] . for convenience",
    ", we summarizes in table [ tab : models ] main differences among the three models and what we regard as being consequences of these models to be compared with observations .",
    "about the superoutburst and supercycle of su uma stars , @xcite proposed a model ( now called the thermal - tidal instability model , or tti model in short ) in which the ordinary thermal instability is coupled with the tidal instability [ see , @xcite for a review ] .",
    "the tti model is basically of the disk - instability variety , in which the mass - transfer rate from the secondary is assumed to be constant , and all variability is thought to be produced within the disk .",
    "the tti model explains the supercycle of su uma stars in the following way . in the initial stage of the supercycle ,",
    "the disk is assumed to be compact well below the 3:1 resonance radius .",
    "a successive outburst ( normal outburst ) causes mass accretion onto the central white dwarf , but the accreted mass is less than the mass transferred in quiescence .",
    "the mass and the angular momentum of the disk accumulate and the disk s outer edge therefore grows with a succession of normal outbursts , and the final normal outburst ( a triggering normal outburst ) brings disk s outer edge beyond the 3:1 resonance radius @xmath1 ( where @xmath2 and @xmath3 is the binary separation ) .",
    "the disk then becomes tidally unstable , and a circular disk is transformed to a slowly precessing eccentric disk .",
    "the tidal dissipation of the eccentric disk now enhances the mass flow in the disk , sustaining a hot state of the disk so as to cause a longer superoutburst .",
    "when sufficient mass is drained from the disk , the surface density of matter in the outer edge reaches the critical one , below which no hot state exists .",
    "the disk makes a downward transition to a cool state . the cooling front propagates inward , extinguishing the outburst , i.e. , an end of the superoutburst .",
    "the eccentric disk eventually returns to a circular one because of the addition of matter of low specific angular momentum . because of the enhanced tidal torque during the superoutburst stage , the disk becomes compact in the end .",
    "a new supercycle begins .",
    "this is the basic picture of the tti model , but a minor modification and a further refinement of this model have been proposed by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",

    "as far as the mass accumulated during a supercycle is concerned , the difference between a normal outburst just prior to a superoutburst and the next superoutburst is rather small , as can be seen in the lowest panel of figure [ fig : osaki05fig ] .",
    "however , there is a big difference between these two states concerning the tidal removal of angular momentum from the disk . in the case of a normal outburst",
    ", the disk s outer edge is below the tidal 3:1 resonance radius , and thus the tidal removal of angular momentum is very ineffective . on the other hand , the disk s outer edge exceeds the tidal 3:1 resonance radius in the last normal outburst or the triggering outburst ( which is a part of precursor of a superoutburst ) .",
    "the tidal instability then develops , which is observationally seen as growing superhumps .",
    "as discussed in @xcite and @xcite , in the case of no effective tidal removal of angular momentum from the disk , an expansion of the disk due to the thermal instability immediately returns the surface density at the outer edge of the disk to the critical density below which there exists no hot state .",
    "the disk then makes a downward transition to the cool state and the cooling wave propagates inward and the outburst is short .",
    "this is the reason why the normal outburst just prior to a superoutburst is so short , even if mass is sufficiently accumulated in the disk .",
    "the key point of the tti model lies in the disk - radius variation shown in the middle panel of figure [ fig : osaki05fig ] .",
    "this must be tested observationally but it had been difficult before the kepler observations    @xcite have performed light - curve simulations of the superoutburst and supercycle of su uma stars by using a one - dimensional numerical code based on the tti model .",
    "two different prescriptions for the viscosity in the cold state ( i.e. , @xmath5 ) have been examined there .",
    "one is a case of outside - in normal outbursts where the @xmath6 viscosity has a radial dependence ( called there `` case a '' ) ; the other is an inside - out case ( `` case b '' ) where the @xmath6 viscosity is constant with respect to the radius .",
    "it has been shown that quiescent intervals between normal outbursts increase monotonously with the advance of supercycle phase in case a ( see , their figure 1 ) while they stay almost constant during the supercycle in case b ( see , their figure 2 ) .",
    "this point will be discussed later together with kepler light curves . @xcite",
    "have performed light curve simulations by using their code , confirming that the tti model can account for su uma light curves .",
    "two - dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) code simulations of superhumps and superoutbursts of su uma stars were performed by @xcite and @xcite , confirming that the superoutburst and superhump phenomena are a direct result of the tidal instability .",
    "@xcite made 3d sph simulations of superhumps , and found such enhanced tidal torques as to transfer the angular momentum from the disk to the binary s orbital motion when the eccentric instability develops , as suggested in the tti model .",
    "two alternative models to explain the superoutburst phenomenon have been proposed besides the tti model .",
    "one is the enhanced mass - transfer model ( emt model ) due to irradiation heating of the secondary star , advocated by smak .",
    "the other is the pure thermal instability model by @xcite .      the enhanced mass - transfer model for superoutbursts of su uma stars",
    "was first proposed by @xcite , and discussed by @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the superoutburst of su uma stars is produced by enhanced mass transfer from the secondary star , which is in turn caused by irradiation heating of the secondary star .",
    "@xcite proposed an emt model , a model of the irradiation - induced mass - overflow instability as a possible cause of superoutbursts in su uma stars .",
    "however , @xcite abandoned this model later in favor of the tti model .",
    "smak pursued this model instead .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite has been writing a series of papers in acta astronomica in which he criticizes the tti model , and instead he advocates the enhanced mass - transfer ( emt ) model . in the emt model , the long duration of the superoutburst of su uma stars is thought to be produced by the enhanced mass transfer from the secondary star , which is in turn caused by irradiation heating of the atmosphere of the secondary star due to ultraviolet radiation from the mass - accreting white dwarf and the boundary layer between the accretion disk and the central white dwarf . in the emt model",
    "the superhump phenomenon is not directly related to the mechanism of the superoutburst .",
    "rather , the superhump is thought to be produced by a modulated dissipation of the gas stream due to modulated mass outflow , which is in turn produced by periodically variable irradiation of the secondary star @xcite .    as @xcite ,",
    "@xcite , @xcite clearly stated , he was motivated to pursue the emt model because of following two seeming difficulties in the tti model , to which we address ourselves in this paper :    1 .",
    "observational evidence for enhanced mass transfer : + @xcite argued in his review of vw hyi that the amplitude of its orbital humps increases in maximum or declining stage of normal outbursts if they occur less than 40 d before the next following superoutburst , and interpreted that the mass - transfer rate from the secondary star is enhanced .",
    "@xcite regarded this point as one of the difficulties of the tti model .",
    "2 .   sequence of events that the tti model predicts : + smak raised another question concerning the tti model , which is connected with the sequence of events responsible for superoutbursts and superhumps .",
    "he argued that in the tti model the sequence begins with a tidal instability , leading to the formation of an eccentric disk , and causing a major enhancement of the accretion rate .",
    "accordingly , the superhump should appear at the very early phase of a superoutburst ( certainly not later than maximum ) . in most cases",
    ", however , it appears one or two days _ after the superoutburst maximum_.    as regards point 1 , @xcite already questioned vogt s interpretation of `` orbital humps '' , and suspected that observed humps could be of a superhump nature .",
    "this is the very controversy about the nature of observed humps .",
    "these two problems raised by smak will be discussed while considering the kepler light curve of v1504 cyg .",
    "light - curve simulations based on the emt model were made by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite performed light - curve simulations in both the tti model and the emt model , and they compared their results with multiwavelength light curves of vw hyi , one of the best observed su uma stars before the kepler observations .",
    "all outbursts in their models turned out to be of the inside - out type because of their viscosity prescription .",
    "it was found there that both models can generate precursor outbursts that are more pronounced at shorter wavelengths , which is in agreement with observations .",
    "since there are adjustable free - parameters in the numerical light - curve simulations for both the tti model and the emt model , @xcite stated that it is difficult to decide which model is better for explaining observations .",
    "however , these authors have concluded that the emt model should be favored over the tti model because the emt model is more sensitive to any mass - transfer rate variation , which is supposed by these authors to be responsible for variations seen in different supercycles in one star and in different su uma stars .    in the emt model , the mass - transfer rate",
    "is thought to be greatly increased during a superoutburst .",
    "the response of the secondary s envelope to enhanced mass transfer has to be considered .",
    "that is , the response of the mass reservoir of the envelope of the secondary will affect the recurrence time of the supercycle in su uma stars .",
    "this effect has not been taken into account in the simulations of @xcite , and their results are thus incomplete in this respect .",

    "this is an idea first proposed by @xcite . in this model , not only the short normal outburst , but also the long superoutburst is explained by the standard thermal limit cycle instability , and the tidal instability is not needed to explain the long duration of the superoutburst and the supercycle phenomenon in su uma stars .",
    "the superhump is only an additional phenomenon , and it is of secondary importance . @xcite",
    "performed numerical simulations , demonstrating that the thermal limit cycle instability without any tidal instability is complex enough to produce the superoutburst and the supercycle of su uma stars in which several short outbursts are sandwiched by two long outbursts .    in cannizzo s",
    "pure thermal limit - cycle model , the short normal outburst is explained by an inside - out outburst in which an outburst is started in the inner part of the accretion disk and the heating front propagates outward , but it does not reach the disk s outer edge and is reflected in the middle of the disk as a cooling wave [ see , figures 3 and 4 of @xcite ] .",
    "this type of outburst is called as `` type bb '' in smak s classification , and it is known that the disk s outer edge does not expand in this type of outburst , even when an outburst occurs ( see @xcite ) . in this model , the mass in the outer part of the disk is untapped during short normal outbursts , but only the mass in the inner part is accreted during these outbursts .",
    "the triggering outburst in this model is also the inside - out outburst , but this time the heating front traveling outward finally reaches the disk s outer edge , producing a long superoutburst with the viscous plateau stage ( i.e. , smak s type ba outburst ) .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , an alternation of narrow and wide outbursts can be produced in the case of the inside - out outbursts .",
    "on the other hand , in the case of the outside - in outbursts , the widths of outbursts are more or less similar .",
    "if any normal outburst in su uma stars turns out to be outside - in based on observations , cannizzo s model will meet a serious difficulty .",
    "we discuss below cannizzo s pure thermal instability model as well .",
    "kepler observations now open a possibility of discriminating between these three models of su uma stars from a purely observational point of view .",
    "two su uma - type dwarf novae , v1504 cyg and v344 lyr , were observed with the short cadence mode by the kepler satellite .",
    "these light curves have already been studied by cannizzo and his group , i.e. , concerning quiescent superhumps @xcite , numerical models of the long term light curve of v344 lyr @xcite , studies of both positive and negative superhumps in the long term light curve of v344 lyr @xcite , and a study of the outburst properties of v1504 cyg and v344 lyr @xcite . in this paper",
    "we examine the same kepler data of v1504 cyg , but from a different point of view .",
    "data that we have used in this paper extend over the period from 2009 june to 2011 march .",
    "we discuss three problems : the global light curve ( subsection [ sec : globallc ] ) , the way superoutbursts start ( subsection [ sec : startso ] ) , and the negative superhump ( subsections [ sec : negsh ] and [ sec : negpos ] ) .",
    "as shown below , we have reached quite a different conclusion from that of @xcite concerning the nature of the superoutburst and supercycle .",
    "the kepler light curves of v1504 cyg and v344 lyr , extending over 736 d at 1 min cadence , have been examined by @xcite ; they have studied various correlations , such as quiescence intervals between normal outbursts for the period of one supercycle . here",
    ", we examine the same data set of v1504 cyg from a different standpoint .",
    "the data we used are those of a public release of 632 d at 1 min cadence . since @xcite examined v344 lyr , we examine data of v1504 cyg here .",
    "the kepler light curve of v1504 cyg was already studied by @xcite .",
    "we summarize the basic data of v1504 cyg obtained there ; its orbital period is 0.069549 d ( 1.67 hr or 14.38 c / d ) , the ( ordinary or positive ) superhump period @xmath0 0.072 d ( 13.8 c / d ) , and the negative superhump period @xmath0 0.068 d ( 14.7 c / d ) .",
    "we made a two - dimensional power spectral analysis ( the dynamic spectrum ) of the light curve of v1504 cyg , and show our results together with the light curve in figure [ fig : v1504spec2d ] .",
    "we used the kepler raw data ( sap_flux ) during the period of 632 d from barycentric julian date ( bjd ) 2455002 to 2455635 . in calculating the power spectra ,",
    "we used a locally - weighted polynomial regression ( lowess : @xcite ) to kepler magnitudes ( on an arbitrary zero - point ) for removing trends resulting from outbursts using smoothing parameters ( @xmath8=0.0003 , @xmath9=0.2 ) in r softwarehttp://cran.r - project.org/@xmath7 . ] .",
    "we then estimated the pulsed flux by multiplying the residual amplitudes and lowess - smoothed light curve converted to the flux scale . in calculating the fourier spectrum",
    ", we used a hann window function with a 5 d width of the moving window , and 0.5 d as the time step .",
    "figure [ fig : v1504spec2d ] shows the overall light curve in the top panel , power spectra in a wider frequency range in the middle , and their enlarged portion near the orbital frequency of the star in the bottom , since we are interested in this region .",
    "let us first look at figure [ fig : v1504spec2d ] for light curve of v1504 cyg .",
    "the kepler data of v1504 cyg we use here include five superoutbursts and four supercycles ; we summarize their main characteristics in table [ tab : supercycle ] . here , we define the start of a supercycle as `` the start of quiescence just after the preceding superoutburst  and its end as ' ' the end of the superoutburst .  the first column ( 1 ) of table [ tab : supercycle ] is the supercycle ordinal number of our data , while the next three columns give ( 2 ) bjd of the start of a supercycle , ( 3 ) the start of a superoutburst , and ( 4 ) bjd of the end of the superoutburst counted from bjd 2455000 .",
    "thus the date of the start of a supercycle is the same as that of the end of the preceding superoutburst , as can be seen in the table .",
    "the following three columns give the lengths in days of a supercycle excluding superoutburst ( 5 ) , of the superoutburst duration ( 6 ) , and of the full supercycle ( 7 ) , respectively ; thus the sum of the two columns , ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) , is equal to column ( 7 ) . the next column ( 8) gives number of normal outbursts during a supercycle .",
    "the last two columns , ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) , give comments on the appearance ( or visibility ) of negative superhumps and orbital humps in the power spectrum of figure [ fig : v1504spec2d ] , respectively , where `` no '' means no strong signals in the power spectrum .",
    "we have four complete supercycles no .",
    "25 , while supercycles no . 1 and no . 6 are incomplete because they are lacking in the preceding and the following superoutbursts , respectively .",
    "as can be seen in the light curve of figure [ fig : v1504spec2d ] and in table [ tab : supercycle ] , one of the most outstanding features in supercycles of v1504 cyg is that the number of normal outbursts during a supercycle differs greatly from supercycle to supercycle , i.e. , it varies from 5 ( for supercycle no .",
    "5 ) to 10 ( for supercycles no . 2 and no .",
    "3 ) in the case of v1504 cyg .",
    "although the duration of the supercycle differs among different supercycles ( its average value is @xmath0 110 d in v1504 cyg ) , its difference is small as compared with the difference in the number of outbursts among different supercycles .",
    "the duration of superoutbursts does not differ much in different supercycles , either .",
    "this point will be discussed later in this subsection .",
    "( 160mm,200mm)fig3_sm.eps    ( 160mm,200mm)fig4_sm.eps    let us now examine the power spectra shown in the middle and lower panels of figure [ fig : v1504spec2d ] , and also those of individual supercycles in figure [ fig : v1504spec2dseq ] for more details where a frequency 14.38 c / d for the orbital period is indicated by the dashed line .",
    "we can see that the strongest signal in the power spectrum occurs at a frequency of around 13.8 c / d , corresponding to that of ordinary ( positive ) superhumps whenever a superoutburst occurs  a well - known fact concerning su uma stars .",
    "its higher harmonics are all visible in the middle panel of figure [ fig : v1504spec2d ] , indicating the nonsinusoidal waveform of the positive superhump light variation .",
    "the most interesting aspect of the dynamic spectrum is the appearance of `` negative hump  at frequency around 14.7 c / d . these are humps with a period shorter than the binary s orbital period ( a few percent shorter than the orbital period ) .",
    "although the origin of negative superhumps has not been yet firmly established , the standard interpretation is that of retrograde nodal precession of a tilted disk ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "since there is no viable alternative model , we adopt the model of a tilted disk as a working hypothesis , and examine the kepler data based on this model . in this picture",
    "the negative superhump is produced when the accretion disk is tilted from the binary s orbital plane , and its nodal line precesses retrograde , and the negative - superhump periodicity is produced by the synodic period between the retrograde precessing disk and the orbiting secondary star .",
    "the light variation with the negative - superhump period is thought to be produced by a periodic change in the dissipation of the kinetic energy of the gas stream from the secondary star with varying depth of potential well in the disk as it sweeps around the tilted disk ( see @xcite ) . when the accretion disk is coplanar with the orbital plane , the gas stream collides with the disk at the outer rim and this produces ' ' orbital humps  with the binary s orbital period .",
    "negative superhumps for the kepler data of v344 lyr have been already discussed from the standpoint of a tilted disk by @xcite . in v344 lyr , negative superhumps appeared both in quiescence and in normal outbursts ; on another occasion the signature of the negative superhump disappeared .",
    "a signature of the orbital hump appeared from time to time but these two signals did not seem to exist simultaneously .",
    "we can see in the lower panel of figure [ fig : v1504spec2d ] that a signal of the negative superhump appeared in the middle of supercycle no . 3 in v1504 cyg .",
    "it is not clear when this signal first appeared but a very weak signal is recognized at around bjd 2455250 .",
    "its intensity increased with time , and this signal became very clearly visible after bjd 2455350 in the later half of supercycle no .",
    "4 . it continued to be seen until bjd 2455600 , and then tapered off .",
    "most interestingly , the appearance of negative superhumps is strongly correlated with the duration of the quiescence interval of outbursts ; the quiescence interval between two outbursts becomes longer when the negative superhump appears .",
    "that is , the appearance of negative superhumps tends to reduce the frequency of normal outbursts .",
    "the same type of phenomena has already been observed in other su uma stars with high mass - transfer rates , such as v503 cyg ( @xcite , @xcite ) and er uma @xcite .",
    "@xcite also noticed this in the kepler light curve of v344 lyr . in our kepler data",
    "we basically confirm the findings of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite that the existence of negative superhump suppresses frequent occurrence of normal outbursts .",
    "a similar type of difference in supercycles has already been noticed in light curves of vw hyi ( a prototype su uma star ) . @xcite",
    "has classified them into two types : type l supercycle in which the interval of the last two normal outbursts is longer than 30 d and type s in which it is shorter than 23 d , where the average supercycle length of vw hyi is @xmath0 180 d. the number of normal outbursts in the type l supercycle is small , while that in type s is roughly twice as large as that of type l. in type l supercycle of vw hyi , the quiescence interval between normal outbursts increases monotonously with the advance of the supercycle phase , while in type s it increases till the intermediate phase of supercycle , but decreases in its latter half .",
    "@xcite has found no correlation between these two supercycle types with either preceding or following superoutbursts , and with other supercycle properties .",
    "thus , the origin of these two types remains to be a mystery .    here",
    ", we make use of smak s symbols of type l and type s supercycles in our case of v1504 cyg . we define here that the type l supercycle is that in which the quiescence interval between two normal outbursts is relatively `` long '' , but the number of normal outbursts during a given supercycle is small , while the type s is that in which the quiescence interval between two normal outbursts is `` short '' , but the number of normal outbursts during a supercycle is large . however , we note that smak s distinction for types l and s in vw hyi concerns only the last two normal cycles , while it applies to most of the normal outburst intervals in our case . in figure",
    "[ fig : v1504spec2d ] we find that in v1504 cyg , supercycles no .",
    "4 and no . 5",
    "correspond to type l , while supercycle no .",
    "2 corresponds to type s.    phenomenologically speaking , we may understand from the kepler data that the type l supercycle is accompanied by negative superhumps while the type s supercycle does not have negative superhumps .",
    "furthermore , if we adopt a tilted disk as the origin of the negative superhump , we can understand how the two distinct types of supercycle , type l and type s , are produced , as discussed below .",
    "( 160mm,200mm)fig5.eps    v1504 cyg belongs to su uma stars with high mass - transfer rates since their supercycle lengths are short ( i.e. , its mean value of around 110 d ) , showing frequent normal outbursts .",
    "most normal outbursts in v1504 cyg are expected to be of outside - in type , which has been confirmed by the observed shape of the outburst light curve , i.e. , a rapid rise to the outburst maximum and a slow decline from the maximum [ see , @xcite ; he calls such an outburst `` type a outburst '' ] .",
    "@xcite also mentioned the same view .    if the disk is co - planar with the binary orbital plane , the gas stream leaving the inner lagrangian point of the secondary reaches the outer rim of the disk . on the other hand ,",
    "if the disk is tilted , the gas stream sweeps over the tilted disk , but it hits the outer rim twice during the synodic period between the retrograde preccessing tilted disk and the orbiting secondary star ( i.e. , the negative - superhump period ) and at other times it reaches the inner part of the disk .",
    "in such a case matter reaching the outer edge is effectively reduced , even if the mass - transfer rate from the secondary remains constant . if all normal outbursts during a supercycle are of outside - in types , the normal outburst cycle is then lengthened accordingly , because the recurrence time of normal outburst is essentially determined by the mass - supply rate at the disk s outer edge in the case of an outside - in outburst .",
    "this explains why the number of normal outbursts during a given supercycle is small in the type l supercycle .",
    "we note here that the above discussion is based on an assumption of outside - in type outburst . if mass is supplied to the inner part of the disk via a tilted disk , the probability of occurrence of inside - out outburst will increase",
    ". therefore we must be careful to know whether an outburst is outside - in or inside - out .",
    "thus , it is now understood that whether the negative superhump exists or not makes a distinction between type l and s supercycles in v1504 cyg ; that is , the former is accompanied by negative superhumps and the latter is without them .",
    "however , we should note that there are intermediate types of supercycles between these two extreme cases .",
    "for instance , in our supercycle no . 6 ,",
    "in which our kepler data are incomplete , a signal of negative superhumps is visible in its early phase ( during a period of @xmath0 70 d from bjd 2455530 to bjd 2455600 ) during which a frequent occurrence of normal outbursts is suppressed , but it recovered as the signal of negative superhumps tapered off around bjd 2455600 .",
    "although we understand a general picture concerning negative superhumps and the occurrence of normal outbursts , a big problem remains to be solved : how on earth the negative superhump ( i.e. , a tilted disk ) is produced and how it is maintained for a long time .",
    "we discuss the nature of negative superhumps in subsection 3.4 again .",
    "next , we examine how a superoutburst is initiated in v1504 cyg .",
    "it has turned out that all superoutbursts observed in the kepler data of v1504 cyg are of precursor - main type .",
    "figure [ fig : v1504lclarge ] shows enlarged light curves of five superoutbursts of v1504 cyg in our data and one of such light curves has already been shown in figure 75 of @xcite ; also see the kepler light curves shown in @xcite .",
    "we can see very clearly in figure [ fig : v1504lclarge ] that periodic humps ( which have turned out to be `` superhumps '' based on their period ; see the power spectrum in figure [ fig : v1504spec2dseq ] ) appear around the maximum of the precursor ( that is , a triggering normal outburst ) ; they continue to grow in amplitude passing through the local light minimum to the main superoutburst phase , and the time of maximum amplitude of superhumps agrees fairly well with that of the light maximum of the superoutburst .",
    "this is exactly a picture envisioned in the original thermal - tidal model ( tti model ) proposed by @xcite .",
    "although similar phenomena have been observed before in other stars , e.g. , v436 cen @xcite , and qz vir ( t leo ) @xcite , the kepler light curve shown here in figure [ fig : v1504lclarge ] is unprecedentedly clear in this respect .",
    "it is quite evident from figure [ fig : v1504lclarge ] that superhumps are not a result of superoutburst but rather superhumps ( therefore the tidal instability ) are most likely the cause of the superoutburst since superhumps start to grow near the precursor maximum .",
    "the superhump and superoutburst are so much entwined that one is almost difficult to find any interpretation other than the tti model , that is , the tidal instability triggers a superoutburst in v1504 cyg .",
    "furthermore , @xcite have found transient low - amplitude superhumps in the descending branch of a normal outburst just prior to superoutburst no .",
    "1 ( see their figure 78 ) .",
    "similar superhump signatures are also seen in our power spectrum of figure [ fig : v1504spec2dseq ] for normal outbursts just prior to superoutbursts no . 2 and no .",
    "this phenomenon is very well understood as the failed superhump ( or the aborted superhump ) discussed by @xcite , ( see their figure 4 ) .",
    "it is then natural to interpret the periodic humps in the case of vw hyi discussed by @xcite as the same sort of phenomenon , ( i.e. , `` failed superhumps '' ) .",
    "we believe that the first question concerning about enhanced mass transfer prior of a superoutburst raised by @xcite has been clarified by the kepler light curve of v1504 cyg .    as for the second problem raised by @xcite ,",
    "v1504 cyg shows the precursor - main type superoutburst and the superhump appears in the precursor stage and its amplitude grows with the start of the main superoutburst and it reaches maximum almost with the superoutburst light maximum , that is , the sequence of events observed in v1504 cyg is exactly as predicted by the original tti model .",
    "we do not need to address to cases of other su uma stars in which no precursor is observed and in which superhumps appear in one or two days after superoutburst maximum .",
    "these superoutbursts are understood in the tti model as follows : in such a superoutburst the disk expands to reach the tidal truncation radius , passing the 3:1 resonance radius during a triggering normal outburst and the viscous plateau stage begins first and then superhumps grow later , as discussed in @xcite and in @xcite where such a superoutburst is called `` type b '' superoutburst .",
    "these superoutbursts are expected to occur in low mass - transfer su uma systems , which are more numerous in number as compared with high mass - transfer systems such as v1504 cyg and v344 lyr .",
    "let us now turn our attention to the pure thermal instability model advocated by cannizzo and his group .",
    "@xcite made numerical simulations of light curves based on the pure thermal - viscous limit cycle instability and compared their results to the kepler light curve of v344 lyr .",
    "the kepler light curves of v344 lyr also show precursors in superoutbursts which these authors called `` shoulders '' .",
    "these authors succeeded in reproducing shoulder - like structure in their superoutburst light curve but the duration of the shoulder in their simulations was found to be too long compared with those of v344 lyr .",
    "our criticism to their pure thermal instability model for their explanation of the precursor is not on this point but rather on the following point .",
    "( 160mm,100mm)fig6.eps    in @xcite simulations , a precursor or `` shoulder '' is produced when the thermal instability starts in the inner part of the accretion disk and the heating front propagates outward but stagnates in the middle of disk for a little while . the heating front restarts to propagate outward to reach the outer edge of the disk which lies at the tidal truncation radius .",
    "the long superoutburst ensues .",
    "the shoulder is produced when the heating front stagnates in the middle of accretion disk in this model .",
    "however , the heating front which stagnates should be never reflected back as a cooling front to produce a superoutburst in their model .",
    "this is because the very outburst would have become merely a short normal outburst if it had been reflected .",
    "that is , in order to have a long superoutburst in their model , the heating front has to propagate all the way to the outer edge of disk , never being reflected .",
    "kepler light curves are optical light curves but it is known that the dip between the precursor and main becomes deeper in observations of shorter wavelength , e.g. , in the voyager far - ultraviolet observations of vw hyi @xcite , and in euv observations of oy car @xcite . in shorter wavelength , the precursor looks like a separate normal outburst .",
    "that means that the heating front has to be reflected as a cooling front in the precursor .",
    "this observational evidence clearly contradicts with the pure thermal instability model advocated by cannizzo and his group , because deep dips are never produced in their model .    on the other hand , in the tti model the precursor",
    "is understood as a result of merging of triggering normal outburst with the main body of superoutburst .",
    "the degree of merging depends on individual stars and individual superoutbursts , sometimes a precursor is clearly separated from the main superoutburst and looks almost like a normal outburst , sometimes these two merge into one continuation . as discussed in @xcite , in the case of tti model the heating front",
    "is reflected at the outer edge as a cooling front in the triggering normal outburst in the `` type a '' superoutburst in which the outer edge of the disk exceeds the 3:1 resonance radius but below the tidal truncation radius . the tidal instability ( and thus superhumps ) ensues in this triggering normal outburst . as superhumps grow in amplitude ,",
    "the tidal dissipation is increased in the outer part of the disk and it eventually rekindles hot transition in the outer part of the eccentric disk , which affects most strongly to optical light . a new separate heating front propagates from outer part inward ( i.e. , a superoutburst is initiated ) while the cooling front is still propagating inward . depending on the relative position of these two fronts , the depths of the precursor dip differ .",
    "this explains why the depths of the dip differ in observations of different wavelength and in different stars in tti model .    as discussed by @xcite , in order to explain the precursor observed in su uma stars , the cooling front has to propagate inward .",
    "@xcite model can not satisfy this requirement and thus the pure thermal instability model is not a viable model for precursor - main type superoutburst in this respect .      as can be seen in the power spectrum of figure [ fig : v1504spec2dseq ] , the negative superhump exists almost always during two supercycles no . 4 and no . 5 , and some systematic variation in frequency is barely visible in these figures .",
    "we thus made a detailed analysis of the frequency variation of the negative superhump using the kepler data during the period from day 380 to day 550 covering a complete supercycle , no .",
    "5 . figure [ fig : v1504negshvar ] illustrates the results for the frequency variation of the negative superhump together with the light curve of v1504 cyg .",
    "we calculated its frequency using a data window of 4 d with a time step of 0.5 d. we used phase - dispersion minimization ( pdm : @xcite ) for obtaining the period , and used @xcite and @xcite for estimating 1-@xmath10 errors in the period . during the superoutburst plateau , we first subtracted the signal of positive superhumps and applied the analysis to the residual signal .",
    "since the amplitude of the negative superhumps was smaller than that of positive superhumps , particularly at around the peaks of the superoutbursts , there were relatively large errors in estimating the period of negative superhumps during a superoutburst .    in figure [ fig : v1504negshvar ]",
    "we find a characteristic variation in the negative - superhump frequency during a supercycle , such as is reminiscent of the disk - radius variation in a supercycle of the tti model shown in figure [ fig : osaki05fig ] .",
    "in fact , if we accept a tilted disk model for the negative superhump , its frequency has turned out to be a good measure of the disk radius .",
    "if we use a simplified model for retrograde precession of a tilted disk , the frequency of the negative superhump is given by ( see , @xcite ) @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the frequency for the negative superhump and binary orbital frequency , respectively , @xmath14 is the mass ratio of the binary , @xmath15 the disk radius , @xmath3 is the binary separation , @xmath16 is the tilt angle of the disk to the binary orbital plane .",
    "we assume @xmath17 for a slightly tilted disk .",
    "furthermore if we assume the mass ratio @xmath18 for v1504 cyg , we can estimate the disk radii , @xmath19 0.43 , and 0.52 for @xmath20 and 14.8 c / d , respectively from equation ( [ equ : diskradius ] ) .",
    "( 88mm,110mm)fig7.eps    we can see in figure [ fig : v1504negshvar ] that the disk radius , @xmath15 , shows a saw - tooth pattern with an expansion of the disk in each normal outburst accompanied by contraction during quiescence ; also the average radius of the saw - tooth pattern increases with the advance of supercycle phase .",
    "finally , the last normal outburst ( which corresponds to a triggering outburst , i.e. , a precursor stage of superoutburst ) brings the disk to a critical radius , ( i.e. , the tidal 3:1 resonance instability radius @xmath21 ) .",
    "a superoutburst ensues and a large amount of mass is drained from the disk during a superoutburst and , after the end of the superoutburst , the disk radius returns to a small value of radius , a picture exactly predicted by the tti model as shown in figure [ fig : osaki05fig ] .",
    "figure [ fig : v1504negshvar ] exhibits clearly how the angular momentum is accumulated in the disk during a supercycle .",
    "the most important prediction of the tti model concerns the disk - radius variation during a supercycle , but its observational test was difficult until kepler observations .",
    "the kepler data of v1504 cyg with the negative superhump now opens a new way to the test of this prediction .",

    "the beat period of these two waves is estimated to be about 1.1 d and the amplitude variations with this beat period are seen in the middle panel of figure [ fig : v1504beat ] .",
    "this means that the disk in v1504 cyg develops tilted and eccentric form simultaneously .",
    "figure [ fig : v1504prof ] shows phase - averaged light curves of the positive superhumps ( upper panel ) and of the negative superhumps ( lower panel ) for this superoutburst .    the light curve of the positive superhump shown in figure [ fig : v1504prof ] is a typical one for the ordinary superhump seen during a superoutburst , that is , a rapid rise to maximum and slow decline sometimes accompanied with a secondary maximum . on the other hand , the light curve of the negative superhump shows more or less a sinusoidal waveform . for comparison , we show a phase - averaged light curve of the negative superhump in quiescence with a period 0.068076 d during 8 d of bjd 2455440448 in figure [ fig : v1504negqui ] .",

    "figure [ fig : v1504negqui ] shows the same wave pattern as that of v344 lyr . as discussed by @xcite and mentioned already in subsection [ sec : globallc ] , the quiescence light curve of the negative superhump is understood in terms of gas stream hitting the different part of the disk .",

    "the tidal perturbing potential in the accretion disk by the secondary star is expressed by      where @xmath38 is the angular frequency of the binary orbital motion and @xmath39 is azimuthal wave number .",
    "the tidal perturbation potential produces deformation in the accretion disk which is described by ( see , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite )        the wave - wave interaction of the tilt mode with the tidal deformation mode produces @xmath41 mode . in this interaction ,",
