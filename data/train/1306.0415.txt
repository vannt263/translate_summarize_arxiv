    "we show the mean - field cavity occupation @xmath75 , the photon number @xmath200 , and the cavity amplitude @xmath195 for both the optomechanical system , with zero and finite temperature of the mechanical bath , as well as for the equivalent kerr medium .",
    "the two insets show the second - order correlation @xmath201 and the overlap @xmath202 .",
    "the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] shows the optical wigner density function of the optomechanical system .    at low driving power before entering the region of bistability , @xmath203 , the state of the optical mode is rather well described by a coherent state in both systems , as @xmath204 .    in the range of driving power where two stable mean - field solutions exist , @xmath205 , the master equations   and have _ unique _ quantum steady states .",
    "thus , instead of any bistable behavior , a transition of @xmath206 and @xmath195 , from the lower to the upper branch , occurs , as the driving power @xmath71 increases .",
    "simultaneously , both systems show large fluctuations in the photon number , @xmath207 .",
    "such behavior , in the regime where the mfes lead to bistability , is well - known from the kerr medium @xcite .    in this regime , the wigner function @xmath208 , shown in the lower part of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] , exhibits two separate lobes peaked at the mean - field amplitudes , @xmath209 .",
    "this is another well - known feature of the kerr medium @xcite and shows how classical bistability persists in the quantum regime .",
    "the two lobes are distinguishable if the phase - space separation of the two stable mean - field amplitudes @xmath37 is larger than the fluctuations around them , which is satisfied here since @xmath210 . since @xmath211 everywhere , the optical mode can be regarded as an incoherent statistical mixture of two states with different amplitudes and non - gaussian fluctuations . as the driving power @xmath71 increases from @xmath212 to @xmath213 , the relative weights of the lobes continuously change from the lower branch to the upper one , describing the shift in probability for the system to be found in one or the other .",
    "this effect is robust to finite temperature of the mechanical environment .",
    "the particular situation where the two stable branches are approximately equally likely ( @xmath214 for @xmath215 ) would enable the observation of noise - induced switching between both branches @xcite and constitute a clear signature of the nonlinear interaction between the optical and mechanical mode .    at higher driving power , @xmath216 , when the mfes have only one solution , both the optomechanical system and the kerr medium exhibit sub - poissionian statistics , @xmath217 .",
    "photon blockade in optomechanical systems has already been predicted for @xmath218 @xcite . in our case ,",
    "photon blockade is not very pronounced : we chose @xmath210 to have bistable mean - field solutions that are appreciably distant in phase space . for the parameters of fig .  [",
    "fig : fig3 ] , this effect is slightly suppressed even further due to the finite - temperature bath , @xmath219 .    at various points of the paper , we have already demonstrated that the optomechanical system can be regarded as an effective kerr medium in some range of parameters that we have specified .",
    "in particular , in the present section we have shown numerically that both systems exhibit the same features .",
    "for example , the photon number and the second - order photon correlation function follow the same parameter dependence , the wigner function has a two - lobe structure , and both systems show photon blockade . as a further strong confirmation of this equivalence",
    ", we compare the states @xmath198 and @xmath188 of the optical field in both systems . as can be seen in inset ( c ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] , their overlap @xmath220 is close to 1 even at a finite thermal occupation of the mechanical mode .",
    "all of these calculations clearly establish the equivalence of the optomechanical system and a kerr medium in the appropriate parameter range .",
    "the mean - field equations for the optical mode of a dispersively coupled optomechanical system agree with those of a kerr medium , a paradigmatic quantum optics system whose nonlinearity induces optical bistability .",
    "this raises the question of whether and under which conditions the two systems can be considered to be equivalent .",
    "we have therefore compared the optical bistability in an optomechanical system and a kerr medium .",
    "a stability analysis of the mean - field solutions reveals differences between the two systems : the upper branch of an optomechanical system can become unstable due to position fluctuations of the mechanical degree of freedom .",
    "we have identified the regime of parameters where the two systems are equivalent .",
    "corroborating this semiclassical approach , we have shown that the ( optical ) quantum steady states of both systems , obtained numerically , show large overlap .",
    "our results clarify when an optomechanical system can be used as a kerr nonlinearity in applications of quantum optics and quantum information .",
