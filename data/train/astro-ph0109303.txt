    "the magnetostatic equilibrium of the system of the interstellar gas and magnetic field under the vertical gravitational field of the galaxy has been shown to be unstable @xcite . the physical mechanism for the instability relies on the fact that a light fluid ( represented by the magnetic field ) supports a heavy fluid ( represented by the gas ) and the configuration tends to overturn .",
    "it has similarities to the rayleigh - taylor instability , when a true light fluid supports a heavy fluid . in the rayleigh - taylor instability",
    ", the fastest growing mode has an infinite perturbation wavenumber .",
    "however , taking into account a `` uni - directional '' magnetic field along the azimuthal direction in the galactic disk , @xcite showed that the magnetic tension stabilizes large wavenumber perturbations and results in a preferred , finite wavenumber .",
    "but when the perturbations along the radial direction are allowed , those with an infinite radial wavenumber prevail @xcite . as a result",
    ", the structures formed by the parker instability are expected to be elongated , and @xcite confirmed it through three - dimensional simulations for the nonlinear evolution of the parker instability .",
    "the parker instability in the interstellar medium ( ism ) has been thought to be a viable mechanism in forming giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) in the galaxy ( see , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the work of @xcite raised negative points on that .",
    "in addition to the fact that sheet - like structures with the smallest scale in the radial direction are formed , they found that the enhancement factor of column density is at most @xmath4 . the second density issue is eased by noting that the interstellar gas can be further susceptible to the thermal instability , as pointed in @xcite , followed by the gravitational instability .",
    "however , the first structural issue , which is the direct result of the infinitesimal radial wavenumber , does not easily go away .",
    "several ideas on effects that could suppress the maximally unstable nature of the mode with an infinite wavenumber have been suggested .",
    "one of them is to invoke a `` stochastic magnetic field '' @xcite , which represents the random component of the galactic magnetic field .",
    "using a field composed of the usual mean component and a transverse component whose strength is weak and random , they showed that in `` cold plasma '' ( without gas pressure ) the weak , random component exerts a significant stabilizing effect on the perturbations with small transverse wavelengths .",
    "the physical mechanism is the following .",
    "although weak , the tension of the transverse component that is incurred by the vertical gas motions is strong enough to reinstate the gas .",
    "they suggested the possibility of preferred modes with finite transverse ( radial ) wavenumbers .",
    "such modes would result in broadened structures , which would resemble more the morphology of the gmcs .",
    "their stochastic field model is promising in the sense that i ) it is consistent with the turbulent picture of the ism ( see , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and ii ) it is supported by the observations of magnetic field in our galaxy and spiral galaxies ( see , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , their cold plasma approximation needs to be improved .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to analyze fully the effects of the random component of the magnetic field on the parker instability in a medium with finite gas pressure .",
    "we find rather surprising results that the random component either reduces the growth of the instability significantly or suppresses it completely .",
    "and the most unstable mode has a vanishing radial wavenumber .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "linear stability analysis is carried out by analyzing the dispersion relation in  2 .",
    "summary and discussion follow in  3 .",
    "we consider the stability of an equilibrium system where gas is supported by its own and magnetic pressures against a `` uniform '' gravity , @xmath5 , in the negative @xmath6 ( vertical ) direction . with realistic gravities different growth rates and wavelengths of unstable modes would result ( see , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but they make the analysis much more involved . in addition , we expect the qualitative features of the stability would nt be affected by details of gravity . for the magnetic field configuration , the stochastic model suggested by @xcite is adopted . it is composed of a mean component , @xmath0 , in the @xmath7 ( azimuthal ) direction , and a random component , @xmath8 , in the @xmath9 ( radial ) direction .",
    "@xmath2 is a random function of @xmath6 with zero mean .",
    "one assumption made on @xmath2 is that the correlation length is small compared to the vertical scale height of the system .",
    "so in the equations below , the local average is taken by integrating over @xmath6 for a vertical scale greater than the correlation length of @xmath2 but smaller than the scale height .",
    "then , the dispersion @xmath10 is taken as a constant , which becomes a free parameter of the analysis . with finite gas pressure , @xmath11 ,",
    "the magnetohydrostatic equilibrium is governed by @xmath12 = - \\rho g,\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is gas density .",

    "but in any case the radial wavenumber of the most unstable mode shrinks to zero @xmath69 .",
    "_ that is , the instability basically becomes two - dimensional in the plane defined by the azimuthal and vertical directions .",
    "_ this result is opposite to that of @xmath56 , where the dominant mode of the instability has vanishing radial wavelength @xmath70 .",
    "the parker instability is induced by the magnetic buoyancy of uniform component of magnetic field , while gas pressure and random component exert stabilizing effects . the role of gas pressure is mainly exercising pressure force along the uniform component , and set finite wavenumbers for the instability along the uniform component direction . on the other hand , random component threads rising and sinking slices across the uniform field .",
    "its tension becomes stronger at larger wavenumbers .",
    "so the role of the random field is to suppress the growth of perturbations with large wavenumbers perpendicular to the uniform field .    through the linear stability analysis which includes both gas pressure and random magnetic field , we have found that with the observationally favored values for the strength of the random component , @xmath67 , the tension of the random component that is incurred by the vertical gas motions is strong enough that the growth of the instability is either significantly reduced or completely suppressed . for smaller values , @xmath66 , which are suggested by others ,",
    "the parker instability is still operating but with reduced growth rate and vanishing radial wavenumber . with @xmath66 , by taking @xmath71 pc and @xmath72 km / s @xcite , the growth time scale and the azimuthal wavelength of the most unstable mode are @xmath73 myrs and @xmath74 kpc , respectively .",
    "they are too large for the parker instability to be a plausible mechanism for the formation of gmcs .",
    "but it is known that realistic gravity would reduce both ( see , * ? ? ?",
    "the more serious obstacle in the context of the gmc formation is the fact that the radial wavelength of the most unstable mode is infinity .",
    "this indicates the structures formed would be elongated , in this case , along the radial direction .",
    "but it is not clear whether such elongated structures would persist in the stage of the nonlinear development of the instability .",
