    "the two states @xmath0 and @xmath1 observed in the invariant mass spectrum of @xmath5 in @xmath2 by the lhcb collaboration  @xcite has immediately attracted a lot of attention from the whole community since they could be the long - searching - for pentaquark states in the heavy flavor sector .",
    "recent theoretical studies can be found in refs .",
    "their masses are @xmath6 mev and @xmath7 mev , respectively , and their widths are @xmath8 mev and @xmath9 mev , respectively .",
    "their preferred @xmath10 are either @xmath11 and @xmath12 , or @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively , based on the detailed experimental analysis .",
    "the possible existence of multiquark states has always been regarded as a natural consequence of qcd .",
    "although the conventional quark model has made tremendous successes in the description of the hadron spectroscopy , it also raised questions on why and how those multiquark states kept out of our sight for such a long time .",
    "the lhcb results and the recent results from belle  @xcite and besiii  @xcite certainly make a big step forward to our understanding the multiquark system .",
    "but at the same time , they also give us chances to ask more questions .    in this letter",
    "we will examine the role of the non - perturbative anomalous triangle singularity ( ats ) in the decay of @xmath2 .",
    "as recently pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the pronounced narrow threshold states in the elastic channels should indicate non - perturbative rescatterings which will eventually generate pole structures after sum over all the loops to infinity .",
    "it was also stressed that if the ats is present the threshold peak will be enhanced and mix with the dynamic pole structure in the inelastic channel .",
    "therefore , in order to understand the nature of the threshold enhancements a careful analysis of the triangle process should be necessary .",
    "there are several interesting features arising from the decay channel as the data have shown .",
    "for instance , there are clear structures for @xmath15 resonances in the lower end of the @xmath16 invariant mass spectrum while the higher mass region appear to smooth out . in contrast , the observed @xmath0 and @xmath1 , in particular , the @xmath1 , are clear structures above the phase space .",
    "note that some interferences occur over a rather broad mass range above the @xmath1 in the @xmath5 invariant mass spectrum ( see e.g. fig .  2 of ref .",
    "this feature suggests that there are intermediate processes in @xmath2 which will give rise to final state interactions .",
    "our motivation is to investigate whether the ats will accumulate the events at the two peak positions .",
    "as follows , in the next section we will first analyze the transition mechanisms for @xmath2 and then investigate the loop diagrams where the ats can be present .",
    "a summary will be given in the last section .",
    "the transition of @xmath2 is dominated by the flavor changing weak decay of @xmath17 via the @xmath18 current .",
    "this leads to an intuitive expectation that the @xmath19 and @xmath20 quark in @xmath4 should be a spectator , hence their isospin quantum number @xmath21 should be conserved . as a consequence ,",
    "if the @xmath22 pair is to be combined with a @xmath23 quark to form a charmed baryon , it will favor @xmath24 baryons instead of @xmath25 ones . in refs .",
    "@xcite the authors propose that @xmath0 and @xmath1 are molecular states of @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "but it was not discussed why the production of @xmath3 in the @xmath4 decay should be significant . also , in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors refer one of the pentaquark candidates to a molecular state of @xmath26 with @xmath28 . in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors proposed to produce the @xmath1 via the @xmath5 rescattering to @xmath29 which , however , should be higher order terms . in a followed - up paper  @xcite",
    "the authors investigate other isospin 0 channel recoiled by @xmath30 .",
    "actually , the production of the @xmath3 is not necessarily to be suppressed at leading order .",
    "since the @xmath31 quark decay is a short - distance process , the final @xmath23 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 quark will be created locally .",
    "they can easily split the @xmath22 quark and rearrange them with the created @xmath34 to form , e.g. @xmath35 .",
    "then the rescattering of @xmath29 into @xmath5 can occur .",
    "this process is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] ( c ) with ( a ) and ( b ) the same mechanism analyzed in ref .",

    "we denote the possible @xmath38 and @xmath39 by the ground state symbols and simply write the amplitudes by the final state particles .",
    "the flavor wavefunction @xmath40 for @xmath4 is implied .",
    "similarly , the decomposition for fig .  [ fig-1 ] ( c ) can be written as @xmath41 \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 and @xmath43 would allow the formation of pentaquark states via the @xmath44 rescatterings as studied in refs .",

    "[ fig-1 ] , we can reexpress the transitions as fig .  [ fig-2 ] where three type of rescatterings will contribute .",
    "figure  [ fig-2 ] ( a ) and ( b ) are triangle diagrams while ( c ) is two - point loop interactions .",
    "we note that the creation of @xmath3 via fig .",
    "[ fig-1 ] ( c ) should be driven by short - distance interactions .",
    "this process will favor the formation of @xmath0 and @xmath1 if they are states generated by @xmath47 interactions .    the interesting property of fig .",
    "[ fig-2 ] ( a ) and ( b ) is that given the masses of the involved states located within certain ranges it will allow the internal states to be on - shell simultaneously .",
    "this is different from the kinematic cusp effects which only recognizes the on - shell condition for two internal particles and contributions from such a branch point is subleading compared to the ats  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we do not expect that such cusp effects produce narrow and strongly enhanced structures in the invariant mass spectrum .",
    "in contrast , when the ats condition is satisfied , the singularity behavior of the integral will produce strong enhancements at the singular points of which the effects can be measured in the experiment .",
    "in particular , the singular points will mostly locate in the vicinity of the two - body thresholds but not necessarily to be exactly at the thresholds .",
    "it should be realized that the positions of the singularity will not change even when higher partial waves contribute at the interaction vertices .",
    "the reason is because the singular term will always be kept in the decomposition of the integrand in the feynman parametrization .",
    "in other words , even though the contribution from the singular term relative to other contributions might be small , its enhancement at the singular point may not be negligible .",
    "nevertheless , in the case of @xmath2 there are several thresholds close to each other .",
    "even a small singularity enhancement can build up and produce measurable effects .    since quite a lot of thresholds can appear in the decays of fig .",
    "[ fig-2 ] and we are still lack of information about the vertex couplings , we only consider low partial waves and thresholds which are close to the masses of interest and we discuss separately the properties of those three types of loops in fig .  [ fig-2 ] .     where the ats and kinematic cusp can be recognized . ,",

    "[ fig-1 ] ( a ) where the rescattering between @xmath49 and an exchanged proton from the decay @xmath50 is considered .",
    "note that the mass thresholds for @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) are close to the peak masses for @xmath0 and @xmath1 as listed in table  [ tab - chic ] .",
    "also , the @xmath53-wave scatterings of @xmath54 and @xmath55 is suppressed in @xmath56 decay or any hadron with only one heavy @xmath31 quark without charm or anti - charm quark as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , we can still estimate how large the next leading order contributions are or what is the behavior after considering it .",
    "] can access the quantum numbers of @xmath13 and @xmath12 for the threshold enhancement .",
    "the @xmath57 and @xmath58 scattering can access the quantum numbers of @xmath59 and @xmath13 .",
    "the @xmath60 can reach @xmath61 and @xmath11 via a @xmath62 wave interaction .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the significant enhancement to the @xmath63 ( with @xmath64 via the ats would prefer that the mass of @xmath15 within the mass regions @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , respectively . from fig .  2 ( a ) of ref .",
    "@xcite , it shows that the cross section for @xmath68 is smooth but non - zero .",
    "note that as long as the kinematics approaching the ats condition , all the cross sections will contribute to the threshold singularity .    in fig .",
    "[ fig - chic ] we show the structures in the invariant mass of @xmath5 via the triangle diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig-2 ] ( a ) .",
    "as discussed before , since @xmath69 and @xmath70 can access the possible quantum numbers via the @xmath53 wave , we only consider loops of @xmath57 and @xmath55 at this moment . on the other hand , since the branching ratio of @xmath71 is one order of magnitude smaller than that of @xmath72 , we expect that it is also the case in the @xmath4 decay .",
    "then , the upper limit of the contributions from @xmath55 can be estimated by requiring @xmath73 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - chic ] , the ats can produce significant threshold enhancement of @xmath74 while the effect from the @xmath70 loop is strongly suppressed .",
    "note that the singularity from the @xmath74 loop exactly locates at the mass position of the observed @xmath75 .",
    "the pole trajectories of the @xmath74 loop and the properties of the poles on different riemann sheet were first considered in ref .  @xcite .",
    ".the @xmath76 thresholds which can be enhanced by the ats via fig .",
    "[ fig-2 ] ( a ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for fig .",
    "[ fig-2 ] ( c ) , the kinematic effects will be just cusp structures in the @xmath5 invariant mass spectrum .",
    "we do not discuss the dynamic consequences if the intermediate @xmath47 ( table  [ tab-3 ] ) may have strong couplings , then they may generate dynamic poles near threshold after proper summation over the bubble loops .",
    "instead , we only show the kinematic cusp for which has turned out not to lead to pronounced structures as recently studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . in another word , the observed pronounced peaks may either be produced by possible pole structures or the ats mechanisms .    in order to try to distinguish the behavior from a pole structure and the ats , we generate the invariant mass spectra of @xmath5 in different @xmath16 invariant mass regions the same as fig .",
    "8 of ref .",
    "@xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - cutoff ] ) .",
    "since the ats contributions will vary in terms of different kinematics , such a quantity will be able to distinguish the behavior of the pole and the ats mechanism .",
    "the results for those three loop processes of fig .",
    "[ fig-2 ] ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) are illustrated by the solid , dashed and dotted lines which are different from the symmetric breit - wigner lineshape .",
    "in particular , the structures created by the cusp effects appear to be negligible .",
    "note that the kinematics of higher invariant mass of @xmath16 is favored by fig .",
    "[ fig-2 ] ( a ) .",
    "it means even small couplings for @xmath63 scattering are introduced , the ats enhancement can still be observable .    since we introduce several mechanisms to generate the kinematic singularities , it is also necessary to discuss their similar and different characteristics .",
    "both @xmath74 and @xmath77 thresholds are very close to the mass of @xmath1 .",
    "note that @xmath74 can scatter into @xmath5 via multi - gluon exchange process , while @xmath78 can scatter into @xmath5 via quark interchange process which is a rearrangement of the quark flavors .",
    "the @xmath62-wave scattering between @xmath57 and proton will imply that the quantum numbers of the @xmath5 system can be @xmath79 , but the @xmath62-wave scattering between @xmath80 and @xmath81 will imply that the quantum numbers can be @xmath82 .",
    "some of these quantum numbers are compatible with the experimental fitting results .",
    "if one hopes the rescattering mechanism can favor the @xmath83 assignment of @xmath1 , the @xmath84-wave rescattering of @xmath74 or @xmath77 will be required .",
    "usually the higher partial wave rescattering amplitudes will be suppressed to some extent .",
    "however , the analytic properties of the kinematic singularities will mainly depend on the kinematics of the loop integrals , which will not be affected too much by the coupling forms of the vertices . to clarify whether the @xmath76 rescatterings or the @xmath85 rescatterings would be dominant in producing the resonance - like peaks",
    ", we suggest that @xmath86 would be a promising channel .",
    "namely , the transition @xmath87 would require the heavy quark spin flip , thus , will be suppressed .",
    "in contrast , in @xmath85@xmath88@xmath89 such a spin flip does not necessarily occur . furthermore , since the @xmath89 threshold is much larger than the lower thresholds , some higher resonance - like peaks induced by the rescatterings , similar to @xmath1 , can be expected in the @xmath89 invariant mass distributions .     with different @xmath16 momentum cuts which are same as fig .",

    "in this work we analyze the role played by anomalous triangle singularity in @xmath2 as a possible contribution to the observed hidden - charm pentaquark candidates @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we first show that the @xmath44 can be produced at leading order which seems to be overlooked in the literature .",
    "we then demonstrate that the ats can generate threshold enhancements which can mimic the experimental observations .",
    "we have to admit that more detailed model construction is needed in order to determine better the ats behavior and strengths .",
    "but we emphasize that the kinematics of @xmath2 are in favor of the ats mechanism when intermediate states are involved .",
    "since all the triangle amplitudes can build up the contributions from the ats near the mass region that we are interested in , they seem to be able to produce structures similar to what observed in experiment . meanwhile , we find that the @xmath94 threshold can give rise to a third peak around 4.5 gev .",
    "we also discuss the kinematic feature of @xmath47 which can produce kinematic cusp effects . in this sense ,",
    "the observed pronounced structures can be either produced by pole structures or the ats mechanism .",
    "the kinematic dependence of the ats is investigated by looking at the ats cross sections in different @xmath16 invariant mass regions .",
    "we also show that the ats mechanism should have rather strong dependence of the kinematics by looking at the @xmath5 invariant mass distributions at different energy cuts for @xmath68 .    in brief , since the ats could play a role in the production of threshold states , it may mix with the pole if the singular threshold is close to the pole position .",
    "such a mixing and interference might generate complicated structures such as to distort the lineshape or produce narrower enhancements that behaves very differently from expected pole contributions .",
