    "tha elliptic flow ( @xmath0 ) measured in heavy - ion collision are believed to arise because of the pressure gradients developed in the overlap region of two nuclei collide at nonzero impact parameters . according to hydrodynamical model @xmath0",
    "is an early time phenomenon and sensitive to the equation of state of the system formed in the collision  @xcite .",
    "so @xmath0 can be used as a probe for early system although its magnitude may change due to later stage hadronic interactions .",
    "the @xmath2-meson , which is the bound state of s and @xmath6 quark , has small interaction cross - section with hadrons  @xcite .",
    "so for the @xmath2-meson @xmath0 , effect of later stage hadronic interaction is small .",
    "therefore elliptic flow of @xmath2-mesons can be used as a clean probe to measure early time collectivity of the system created in heavy - ion collision .",
    "recent results from relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) on @xmath7 as function of transverse momentum ( @xmath1 ) shows that at low @xmath1 elliptic flow of identified hadrons follows mass ordering ( lower @xmath0 for heavier hadrons than that of lighter hadrons ) whereas at intermediate @xmath1 all mesons and all baryons form two different groups .",
    "when @xmath0 and @xmath1 are scaled by number of constituent quarks of the hadrons , the measured @xmath0 values are consistent with each other as parton coalescence or recombination models predicted  @xcite .",
    "this observation , is known as number of constituents quark scaling ( ncq scaling ) .",
    "this effect has been interpreted as collectivity being developed at the partonic stage of the evolution of the system in heavy - ion collision  @xcite .",
    "@xmath2-meson has mass ( 1.02 gev/@xmath8 ) comparable to mass of the lightest baryons ( protons,@xmath9s ) and at the same time it is meson , so study of ncq scaling of @xmath2-meson @xmath0 would be more appropriate to understand the collectivity at partonic level and coalescence as mechanism of hadronization at intermediate @xmath1 .",
    "one of the main goal of rhic beam energy scan ( bes ) program is to see ncq scaling of @xmath0 for all hadrons as function of energy . in this program @xmath2-mesons",
    "@xmath0 plays an important role . because violation of ncq scaling by @xmath2-mesons could be considered as a signature of matter dominated by hadronic interactions .",
    "the results presented here are based on data collected in the bes program at @xmath3= 7.7 , 11.5 and 39 gev in au+au collisions with the star detector with minimum bias trigger  @xcite in the year of 2010 .",
    "the time projection chamber ( tpc ) and time of flight ( tof ) detectors with full @xmath10 coverage were used for particle identification in the central rapidity ( @xmath11 ) region ( @xmath12 1.0 ) .",
    "particles are identified from information of specific energy loss as a function of momentum ( using tpc ) and square of mass as a function of momentum ( using tof ) .",
    "a cut on vertex radius ( defined as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the vertex positions along the @xmath16 and @xmath11 directions ) @xmath17 2 cm has been used to reject events from beam pipe interaction .",
    "the total number of minimum bias events analyzed are about 169 million for 39 gev , 10.5 million for 11.5 gev and 4 million for 7.7 gev .",
    "the event plane method  @xcite ( both full and @xmath18-sub event plane ) has been used for the flow analysis . in this method",

    "the event plane resolution  @xcite is estimated by the correlation of the events planes of two sub - events a and b and is given by @xmath34 > = \\it{c } < \\rm{cos}[2(\\psi_{2}^{a } - \\psi_{2}^{b}]>,\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is a constant calculated from the known multiplicity dependence of the resolution .",

    "the two main possibility of @xmath2-meson production are ( a ) kaon coalescence and ( b ) coalescence of s and @xmath6 quarks in the medium .",
    "the recent results  @xcite from rhic and na49 collaboration  @xcite to @xmath2-meson production shows that the contribution from kaon coalescence should be small in this energy range and the @xmath2-mesons production is dominated by partonic interaction .",

    "the study of @xmath2-mesons @xmath0 using a multi phase transport model ( ampt ) shows that , partonic interaction are necessary for ncq scaling of @xmath0 of hadrons  @xcite .",
