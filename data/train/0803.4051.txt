    "the present interest in the physics of strongly correlated fermion systems is accompanied by a ` revival ' of the gutzwiller wave function ( gwf )  @xcite in order to study hubbard - type models . in these hamiltonians ,",
    "doubly occupied sites contribute with an energy @xmath0 to the total energy , though their weight is partially reduced by the gutzwiller projector .",
    "originally , the projector was applied to a slater determinant describing a spatially uniform fermi liquid . along the years , states with long - range order have been considered , including projected bcs wave functions ,  @xcite used in the context of high-@xmath1 .",
    "analytic evaluations of expectation values using the gwf are only possible in one  @xcite and infinite dimensions .",
    "@xcite in the latter limit , one recovers the so - called gutzwiller approximation ( ga ) first introduced by gutzwiller himself in ref .  .",
    "the ga , later on rederived as a saddle - point within a slave - boson formulation of the hubbard model ,  @xcite yields an energy functional for quasiparticles with renormalized hopping amplitude .",
    "therefore , it offers a simple and intuitive picture for the interplay between local correlation and electron kinetics and it is used in a variety of fields including the description of inhomogeneous states in cuprates ,  @xcite band structure calculations ,  @xcite and the theory of he@xmath2 .",
    "@xcite    in the past few years , two of us have developed a scheme which allows the computation of gaussian fluctuations on top of the ga .",
    "@xcite within this so - called time - dependent ga ( tdga ) , it is possible to evaluate dynamical correlation functions in the charge and spin channel , which over a wide parameter regime are in good agreement with exact diagonalization results and constitute a significant improvement over the traditional hartree - fock plus random - phase approximation ( hf+rpa ) .",
    "the tdga has been used in order to compute dynamical properties of inhomogeneous states in cuprates .",
    "results obtained in this way for the optical conductivity  @xcite and magnetic susceptibility  @xcite of stripe ordered phases have turned out to be in excellent agreement with experimental data .    in the present paper",
    ", we generalize the tdga towards the inclusion of pairing fluctuations .",
    "the significance of such correlations is probably most prominent in the context of superconductivity where the appearance of a singularity in the pair susceptibility signals the onset of cooper - pair condensation . here",
    ", we aim to study the spectrum of pairing correlations in the normal state of the hubbard model , an issue which has also been addressed , among others , within exact diagonalization  @xcite and various monte carlo methods .",
    "@xcite in the particle - hole channel , the coupling to an electric or magnetic field yields the optical conductivity and magnetic susceptibility , respectively . in the particle - particle channel , direct measurements of pairing correlations are not so common since they do not couple to a classical field .",
    "however , principles for the measurement of the pair susceptibility in metals have been discussed in refs .  .",
    "the basic idea is to probe the fluctuating pair field of a metal in the normal state which is coupled to a superconductor via the tunnel current - voltage characteristics .",
    "in addition , the pairing correlation function for local pairs is the main ingredient in the theory of auger spectroscopy  @xcite and also has relevance in the field of ultra - cold atom physics .",
    "@xcite    in materials which can be described within hubbard - type models , a strong local repulsion induces so - called antibound states ( also known as two - particle resonances ) , above the two - particle continuum .",
    "the resonances appear as atomic - like features in the auger spectrum . in ref .",
    "we have shown that , despite its computational simplicity , the tdga yields an excellent description of the two - particle response . in particular , it describes well the energy gap between band and antibound states and the relative spectral weight even far from the dilute limit in contrast to the ` bare ladder approximation ' ( bla ) , which is restricted to the low - density regime .",
    "@xcite thus , the tdga allows one to extend ladder - type theories much beyond their supposed limit of validity .",
    "the result is an effective ladder theory where quasiparticles get heavier , as usual due to correlations , and at the same time the effective interactions between quasiparticles become strongly renormalized .",
    "these vertex and self - energy corrections are consistent with each other and do not suffer from the pitfalls frequently found in diagrammatic computations , where an improvement at the level of the self - energy alone leads to a degradation of the overall performance of the theory due to the lack of appropriate vertex corrections .",
    "@xcite    in this paper , besides a thorough derivation of the ` pairing tdga ' , we extend the approach to intersite correlations with extended s - wave and d - wave symmetry .",
    "we will show that the tdga yields an effective interaction between quasiparticles which is renormalized with respect to the bare @xmath0 due to correlations but it does not include enough fluctuation effects to induce a superconducting instability .",
    "this is because we start from a paramagnetic state treated in the ga which does not have enough variational freedom to describe the scale @xmath3 of magnetic fluctuations .",
    "in addition , within the rpa treatment for a paramagnet the particle - particle and particle - hole channel are decoupled and do not influence each other . for spin - density wave ground states ,",
    "the tdga induces attractive interactions between nearest - neighbor pairs which are not present in the hf approach based on bla .",
    "however , these are not enough to produce a superconducting instability .",
    "superconductivity due to an electronic mechanism requires the feedback of particle - hole fluctuations on the particle - particle channel and this goes beyond our approach . on the other hand ,",
    "at the level of spectroscopic quantities this is a minor effect and our approach turns out to be in excellent agreement with exact diagonalizations . here and below we use the terms `` ladder - type fluctuations '' , `` particle - particle rpa fluctuations '' and `` pairing fluctuations '' as synonymous .",

    "in contrast the bla is clearly quite far from being self - consistent in this sense .    for large @xmath0 ,",
    "the exact double occupancy is of order @xmath182 due to the same charge fluctuations that build the double exchange interaction @xmath3 .",
    "@xcite since the ga and the tdga results in fig .",
    "[ fig2s2 ] are for paramagnetic solutions the double occupancy vanishes at the brinkman - rice point .",

    "due to the more accurate estimate for the double occupancy ( see fig .  [",
    "fig2s2]a ) it turns out that the tdga gives a significantly better approximation for the ground - state energy ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2s2]b ) than the bla over the whole range of @xmath0 , before the onset of the brinkmann - rice transition .",
    "this should be compared with an analogous calculation in the particle - hole channel in ref .  .",
    "in the latter case one obtains a singularity in @xmath188 at @xmath189 due to the onset of the antiferromagnetic ground state . since there is no instability in the particle - particle channel , such problems do not arise in the present case .",

    "<S> we present a method to compute pairing fluctuations on top of the gutzwiller approximation ( ga ) . </S>",
    "<S> our investigations are based on a charge - rotational invariant ga energy functional which is expanded up to second order in the pair fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> equations of motion for the fluctuations lead to a renormalized ladder type approximation . both spectral functions and corrections to static quantities , like the ground - state energy , are computed . </S>",
    "<S> the quality of the method is examined for the single - band hubbard model where we compare the dynamical pairing correlations for s- and d - wave symmetries with exact diagonalizations and find a significant improvement with respect to analogous calculations done within the standard hartree - fock ladder approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the technique has potential applications in the theory of auger spectroscopy , superconductivity , and cold atom physics . </S>"
