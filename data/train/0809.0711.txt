    "many theorists have proposed that antiferromagnetic spin correlations should be relevant to the superconducting mechanism in layered cuprates.@xcite to the extent that they reflect the character of the mott - insulating parent compounds , the coexistence of these antiferromagnetic correlations with metallic conductivity in underdoped cuprates requires concepts that go beyond conventional fermi liquid theory .",
    "one solution that has been proposed is the formation of hole - rich stripes separating narrow antiferromagnetic domains.@xcite static stripe order has been experimentally verified in a few special cuprate compounds , such as  ( lbco),@xcite  ( refs .  ) , and  ( refs .  ) .",
    "the stripe picture tends to draw comparisons with conventional charge- and spin - density - wave ( cdw and sdw ) systems , where the formation of density waves is associated with the gapping of electronic states near the fermi level .",
    "such particle - hole gapping removes states that might otherwise contribute to the particle - particle gap that stabilizes the superconducting state .",
    "thus , to the extent that stripe order in cuprates is like conventional cdw / sdw order , one would expect it to compete with superconductivity .",
    "of course , the stripe order in cuprates does not develop as an instability of a fermi liquid , but rather in response to doping a mott insulator",
    ". nevertheless , the experimental observation that the bulk superconducting transition temperature , @xmath3 , is a minimum when the stripe ordering temperature is a maximum@xcite tends to reinforce objections to stripes being relevant to superconductivity.@xcite    one of the first indications that the story might be more complicated came with the observation that an unusual gap appears in the in - plane optical conductivity together with the onset of charge order.@xcite next , a combination of photoemission and tunneling measurements provided evidence for a @xmath4-wave - like gap at low temperatures , within the stripe - ordered phase but above the bulk superconducting transition , @xmath3.@xcite these signatures were quite suggestive of superconductivity , and they motivated a careful examination of transport and susceptibility measurements.@xcite the latter study provided evidence that two - dimensional ( 2d ) superconducting correlations coexist with stripe order in  at temperatures as high as 40  k. thus , it appears that stripe order is quite compatible with pairing and superconductivity ; however , something about the combined superconducting and stripe - ordered state frustrates the usual josephson coupling between layers that one would expect to result in 3d superconductivity .",
    "it has been proposed that a sinusoidally - modulated superconducting state , minimizing overlap with the spin order , in combination with the 90@xmath5 rotation of the stripe orientation from one layer to the next,@xcite can explain the frustrated josephson coupling.@xcite independent analyses also indicate that the energy of superconductivity coexisting with charge - stripe order is competitive with that of a uniform @xmath4-wave state.@xcite    while the theoretical work is encouraging , the claim of 2d superconductivity is still quite surprising .",

    ", we plot the data on linear scales in fig .",
    "[ fg : linear ] .",
    "we can not think of a credible way for such an extremely anisotropic response to be explained by an impurity phase .",
    "for the sake of argument , let us consider the case of isolated , very thin layers extending across the sample in the directions perpendicular to the @xmath84 axis .",
    "( for example , one might imagine some type of stacking fault in the ltt structure that allows stripes in neighboring planes to be parallel,@xcite thus removing the frustration of the interlayer josephson coupling.@xcite ) the volume fraction of such layers would have to be quite small in order to be consistent with the observed resistivity anisotropy .",
    "suppose there were only one such layer , with a thickness of only a few unit cells ( much less than the c - axis magnetic penetration depth ) .",
    "this defect model could potentially explain the resistivity data ; however , it would be inconsistent with the magnitude of @xmath65 measured by zero - field cooling , which is already quite substantial at @xmath134  k. a single superconducting layer would have a very weak effective diamagnetism because of a very large demagnetization factor . on the other hand ,",
    "if there were many very thin layers distributed along the @xmath84-axis direction , it would be more difficult to estimate the diamagnetic response .",
    "of course , as already mentioned , we do have evidence for a very small volume fraction ( @xmath135% ) of a 3d superconducting phase that sets in at @xmath136  k , with possible onset behavior in @xmath125 at @xmath137  k. while such an effective @xmath3 could potentially be explained by dopant inhomogeneity , it also corresponds to what one might expect to find if the structure were lto , as in lsco .",
    "one possibility is that the finite correlation lengths of the spin and charge stripe orders limit the correlation length for superconducting order ; such disorder might also relax the cancellation of josephson couplings between neighboring layers .",
    "this could result in a 3d glass - like development of superconductivity.@xcite one challenge for such a picture is the distinct evolution of @xmath67 and @xmath65 at lower temperatures  one might expect to see more growth in the diamagnetism of @xmath67 on further cooling , following @xmath65 in some fashion .",
    "another possibility would be the presence of a small volume fraction of lto phase , as might be expected based on electron diffraction studies of lbco with @xmath138 which suggest that the twin boundaries of the ltt phase have lto - like character.@xcite the twin boundaries typically extend as sheets perpendicular to the cuo@xmath80 planes ; however , the typical width within the planes might only be a few tens of ngstroms .",
    "thus , there might be only select lto domains that can support coherent superconductivity , which would be necessary in order to be consistent with the experimental fact that the 3d superconducting domains do not short out the resistivity .",
    "in any case , the twin boundary spacing might provide an upper limit for the divergence of the phase coherence length of the 2d superconductivity .    despite the weak 3d superconducting behavior ,",
    "the growth of the diamagnetic shielding response in @xmath65 is remarkable .",
    "the 2d diamagnetism is reversible between 40 k and @xmath139  k , at which point the fc response seems to saturate , perhaps due to a flux - pinning effect associated with the 3d superconducting regions .",
    "nevertheless , the zfc @xmath65 continues to grow , reaching 20%  of full shielding at the nominal @xmath72 .",
    "this diamagnetic susceptibility is huge compared to the fluctuation diamagnetism typically seen in cuprates just above @xmath3,@xcite even for samples where an anomalous nernst response is found to temperatures well above @xmath3.@xcite      all of the cuprate superconductors are dominated by 2d superconductivity ; however , a finite josephson coupling between the planes always leads to a transition to 3d superconductivity at a temperature higher than the nominal berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless temperature .",
    "thus , our observation of a bkt transition ( inherently 2d behavior ) in a 3d crystal is extremely unusual .",
    "( it may not be unique , as nonlinear transport behavior consistent with a bkt transition at 85  k has been reported@xcite in slightly underdoped bi@xmath80sr@xmath80cacu@xmath80o@xmath140 . ) while this is an experimental surprise , it appears to be an example of a theoretically - predicted `` floating '' ( or `` sliding '' ) phase .",
    "ohern , lubensky , and toner@xcite first showed that , for a 3d stack of 2d @xmath141 models coupled by current - current interactions , weak josephson couplings are irrelevant ( in the renormalization group sense ) and the 2d layers behave as if they are decoupled . that analysis applies directly to the case of a stack of 2d superconducting layers .",
    "the stripe problem is another one in which the relative coupling or decoupling of phases in parallel systems is of interest .",
    "it was first proposed over a decade ago that metallic charge stripes in an antiferromagnetic background could develop pairing correlations.@xcite it was assumed there,@xcite and in later analyses,@xcite that the josephson coupling between stripes would be `` in - phase '' , leading , effectively , to uniform @xmath4-wave superconductivity .",
    "it was also recognized that charge - density - wave ( cdw ) correlations within the charge stripes would compete with the superconducting instability .",
    "thus , it was anticipated that dynamic fluctuations or disorder of the stripes might be essential for achieving 2d superconductivity.@xcite    our experiments demonstrate that the static stripes in lbco at @xmath94 do not appear to have succumbed to cdw ordering .",
    "there is , of course , an anomaly in the longitudinal bond - stretching phonon mode consistent with a strong electron - phonon coupling.@xcite this could well correspond to a coupling of bond - stretching vibrations to low - energy electronic excitations along a stripe ; however , the wave vector of the anomaly corresponds to a nesting of the antinodal states at @xmath142 , where @xmath143 is a fermi wave vector obtained from the photoemission results.@xcite the softened phonon remains at a relatively high energy ( @xmath144  mev ) , so the coupling is purely dynamic .",
    "furthermore , the fact that the coupling is at @xmath142 , rather than @xmath145 , suggests that pairing correlations could be involved .",
    "it turns out that this metallic stripe state does not violate theory .",
    "it has been shown by emery _",
    "et al._@xcite that there is a range of parameter values describing the coupling of charge correlations in neighboring stripes for which it is possible to obtain a floating phase  in this case termed a `` smectic metal''in addition to a smectic superconductor .",
    "this result was developed further by mukhopadhyay , kane , and lubensky,@xcite who considered the case of a stack of stripe layers with the stripe direction rotating @xmath146 from one layer to the next , as occurs in our case .",
    "they showed that it is possible to have a floating phase for which , in the limit @xmath147 , one has @xmath148 and @xmath149 , with both of the exponents , @xmath150 and @xmath151 , positive numbers .",
    "we have a limited temperature range , @xmath152 ( not all that close to the @xmath147 limit ) , in which we can compare with the prediction . the dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fg : linear ] correspond to @xmath129 and @xmath133 .",
    "we should note that one can extend the analysis to @xmath153 by applying a @xmath84-axis magnetic field to suppress the superconductivity . in this case ,",
    "extrapolations of the power - law curves deviate quite a bit from the low - temperature resistivities .",
    "the experimental @xmath56 develops upward curvature,@xcite similar to the @xmath154 behavior seen in underdoped lsco and  at high fields and low temperatures.@xcite we also find that , while @xmath57 continues to increase on cooling , the effective exponent @xmath151 decreases .    to understand our superconducting floating phase , we need a mechanism that would frustrate the josephson coupling between neighboring layers .",
    "a possible solution was first proposed by himeda , kato , and ogata@xcite and then independently rediscovered by berg _",
    "the key idea is that the superconducting wave function oscillates sinusoidally , having a large magnitude on the charge stripes but changing sign from one stripe to the next .",
    "such an antiphase superconducting wave function goes to zero where the magnetic order is largest .",
    "( in this sense , it is similar to the modulated superconducting state proposed by fulde and farrell@xcite and by larkin and ovchinnikov@xcite ( fflo ) in the case of coexisting superconductivity and ferromagnetism . )",
    "when the antiphase superconducting state is combined with the orthogonal orientation of stripes in neighboring planes , it is not hard to see that the josephson coupling between nearest - neighbor planes is frustrated .",
    "( a discussion of possible longer - range josephson couplings is given by berg _",
    "et al._@xcite )    several recent calculations have found that the antiphase superconductor , in combination with stripe order , is quite close in energy to the uniform @xmath4-wave state.@xcite also , it has been noted that these distinct superconducting states will tend to compete with each other.@xcite this has interesting implications that will be discussed below .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath56 looks qualitatively similar to the results of hebard and vandenberg@xcite for a granular lead film . in the latter case ,",
    "the initial drop in resistivity was due to the onset of superconductivity within the lead grains , with the second transition corresponding to 2d superconductivity due to josephson coupling between the grains .",
    "our situation has similarities and differences .",
    "the drop in @xmath155 at 40  k indicates the onset of 2d superconducting correlations . to the extent that the phase - coherence length is finite",
    ", one might consider a region within a plane with a radius comparable to the phase - coherence length to be like a grain .",
    "the second transition in each case involves achieving phase coherence throughout a plane / film .    in our case",
    ", the superconducting correlation length , @xmath156 , will be limited by topological defects , such as dislocations , in the stripe order .",
    "if the correlation length for stripe order is determined by topological defects , then the stripe correlation length should provide an upper limit to @xmath157.@xcite of course , stripe correlations are also impacted by non - topological effects such as variations in stripe spacing,@xcite leading to @xmath158 ( as observed ) , so the stripe correlation length measured by scattering techniques might underestimate the limit on @xmath157 .",
    "structural twin boundaries of the ltt phase are also likely to act as topological defects , so the width of a twin domain likely represents an ultimate limit to @xmath157 .",
    "while the change in @xmath56 at @xmath39 is dramatic , there is an equally dramatic change in @xmath13 at the higher - temperature charge - ordering transition .",
    "the drop in the in - plane thermopower signals a major change in the electronic density of states near the fermi level . the states that make the biggest contribution to the density of states are in the antinodal region of the fermi surface .",
    "furthermore , a gap - like feature in the in - plane optical conductivity also appears at @xmath36.@xcite thus , it seems likely that the antinodal states become gapped with the onset of charge order .",
    "the increased magnitude of @xmath159 for @xmath160 is consistent with such a picture .",
    "an analysis of electronic structure in the cuprates@xcite indicates that conduction along the @xmath84 axis should involve cu @xmath161 states , which couple to the planar conduction band only in the antinodal region .",
    "it follows that gapping the antinodal states should cause a substantial increase in @xmath125 .",
    "in contrast , @xmath56 , which is determined largely by near - nodal states,@xcite changes very little at @xmath36 .",
    "thus , it appears that the nodal states are not greatly affected by the charge order , nor is there much impact from the slowing of the spin fluctuations to a virtually gapless state .",
    "note that the nodal wave vector is at 45@xmath5 to the stripe direction , so that these states involve a 2d dispersion , whereas the antinodal states can be associated with states that disperse along the charge stripes.@xcite    to summarize , it appears that states associated with the charge stripes are gapped , but states that propagate at a significant angle to the stripes are relatively unaffected .",
    "the nature of the gap in the optical conductivity does not seem to change on cooling through @xmath39 , which suggests that the gap that sets in at @xmath36 is associated with pairing .",
    "thus , the data appear to be consistent with strong pairing correlations in the ordered charge stripes , but no coherence between neighboring stripes .",
    "such a state appears similar to the smectic metal@xcite discussed above .",
    "previous studies of the temperature dependence of the spin fluctuations on warming through @xmath36 have provided evidence for the presence of dynamic stripes in the lto phase.@xcite based on such evidence , there seems to be an electronic nematic phase@xcite present at @xmath33 .",
    "an estimate of the critical temperature for the nematic phase is @xmath162  k , the point at which the incommensurability of spin fluctuations can no longer be resolved for low excitation energies ( @xmath163  mev).@xcite if we intepret @xmath36 as a transition from the nematic to the smectic phase ( induced by electron - lattice coupling ) , then these results also have important implications for the nature of the nematic phase ( and its differences from the smectic ) . to the extent that the incommensurability of the low - energy spin fluctuations is driven by a spin gap on the hole - rich stripes ,",
    "the spin gap is present in both phases ; however , gapping of the charge properties only shows up in the nominal smectic phase .    on cooling through @xmath39 ( in zero field )",
    ", we have a transition ( or crossover ) from the 1d pairing correlations of the smectic metal phase to the 2d superconducting correlations of a superconducting smectic phase .",
    "the onset of local superconducting coherence , @xmath164 , appears to be limited by the development of spin - stripe order ; as we have shown previously , @xmath164 decreases rapidly as a @xmath84-axis magnetic field is applied,@xcite whereas @xmath39 is slightly enhanced by the applied field.@xcite ( analysis of magnetic susceptibility indicates that @xmath39 increases slightly with magnetic field oriented perpendicular to @xmath84.@xcite ) the neutron diffraction measurements alone do not prove that the spin - stripe order occurs uniformly within the planes ; however , confirmation of uniform stripe ordering is provided by @xmath40sr@xcite and nuclear - quadrupole - resonance@xcite studies .",
    "we have inferred two steps in the development of the 2d superconducting correlations : first , pairing correlations develop within charge stripes , involving antinodal states , and then local 2d phase coherence develops .",
    "( related ideas have been presented previously by perali _",
    "et al._@xcite and by tsvelik and chubukov.@xcite ) the changes observed in @xmath56 are consistent with the idea that the near nodal states are essential for establishing the phase coherence.@xcite this behavior also seems consistent with the two - gap behavior that has been identified in underdoped cuprates,@xcite in which the @xmath4-wave - like gap in the near - nodal region can extrapolate to a smaller energy than the gap observed for the antinodal states",
    ". it would be quite interesting to see with photoemission whether a gapless nodal arc@xcite of electronic states is present at the fermi level for @xmath165 .",
    "it is interesting to consider an older calculation by monthoux and scalapino.@xcite with the assumption that pairing is due to the exchange of spin fluctuations , they considered superconductivity in a 2d hubbard model and how the distribution of weight in the dynamic spin susceptibility should be adjusted to optimize @xmath3 .",
    "they found that antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations at energies of @xmath166 are the best , but that low - energy spin fluctuations are bad for superconductivity .",

    "the superconducting wave function attempts to minimize its overlap with the troublesome spin correlations .",
    "this also has implications for superconducting lsco , where uniform @xmath4-wave superconductivity has been shown to dominate.@xcite as one cools through @xmath3 , it may be favorable to gap the low - energy spin fluctuations .",
    "this is what appears to happen in lsco from optimal to overdoping , with the weight from below the spin gap being pushed up to energies just above the gap.@xcite it is interesting that the size of the spin gap is @xmath167 at optimal doping .",
    "one possibility is that the amount of low - energy magnetic spectral weight determines which type of superconductivity develops .",
    "if the low - energy spin fluctuations are not too strong , then it may pay to spend some energy to gap these so that a uniform @xmath4-wave state can develop . on the other hand ,",
    "if there is a lot of low - energy , spatially - modulated spectral weight , with the extreme case being the presence of spin stripe order , then the antiphase superconducting state may win out .",
    "these two different superconducting orders will compete with each other , but may also coexist.@xcite with this possibility in mind , we consider the case of underdoped lsco . some degree of static magnetic order has been observed by @xmath40sr@xcite out to a hole concentration of at least 10% , and neutron scattering studies@xcite show that there is no true spin gap in the superconducting state for @xmath168 .",
    "furthermore , the ratio of the superfluid density to the normal - state carrier density is observed@xcite to be low in lsco compared to other cuprates such as , and a study@xcite of the magnetic susceptibility of single crystals indicates that the meissner fraction decreases with @xmath107 for @xmath169 .",

    "the difference in phase coherence could be due to the absence of a crystal potential that could pin stripes in orthogonal directions in neighboring layers .",
    "la@xmath80cuo@xmath170 has a different idiosyncrasy : it has one pair of cuo@xmath80 layers that surrounds the interstitial oxygen layer and another pair that is further removed.@xcite the variation of the magnetic scattering with momentum perpendicular to the planes@xcite is consistent with correlated spin order in pairs of planes@xcite ; which of the inequivalent pairs might have the dominant spin order is not determined by experiment .",
