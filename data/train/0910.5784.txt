    "interest in sets of equiangular lines began at least 60 years ago  @xcite and continues to this day  @xcite . in this article",
    "we report on a new computer study of what has now become one of the most urgent unanswered questions : _ do there exist @xmath0 equiangular lines , the maximum possible , in all finite complex dimensions @xmath1 ? _ this question is attracting increasing attention from the quantum physics community  @xcite and , more recently , from the communities of design theory  @xcite and frame theory  @xcite .",
    "the believed affirmative answer , originally conjectured 10 years ago by gerhard zauner  @xcite , has now been confirmed exactly in dimensions @xmath9",
    "@xcite , @xmath10  @xcite , 6  @xcite , 7  @xcite , 8  @xcite @xmath11  @xcite and 19  @xcite , and to high numerical precision in all dimensions @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "the fundamental question remains unresolved , however , inviting speculation as to whether the true answer is negative , with zauner s conjecture failing in some large untested dimension , or simply that the affirmative answer is truly difficult to prove , with zauner s conjecture remaining open for many years to come . in either case ,",
    "a new computer study is timely .",
    "in quantum theory , a set of @xmath0 equiangular lines in @xmath1 complex dimensions is the underlying mathematical object defining a _",
    "symmetric informationally complete positive - operator - valued measure ( sic - povm ) _  @xcite .",
    "these measures describe the measurement - outcome statistics of a particularly attractive choice of a ` standard ' informationally complete quantum measurement , both from a foundational perspective  @xcite and for the purpose of quantum state tomography  @xcite . in precise terms , a sic - povm @xmath13 is a _ positive - operator - valued measure ( povm ) _ ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite ) that maps each of its @xmath0 possible measurement outcomes , denoted @xmath14 say , to one of @xmath0 subnormalised rank - one projectors on the hilbert space of @xmath1-dimensional pure quantum states @xmath15 , @xmath16 with the defining property that equiangularity is enjoyed under the hilbert - schmidt inner product : @xmath17    considering the rays in @xmath15 upon which each @xmath18 projects , a sic - povm is of course equivalent to a set of @xmath0 equiangular lines through the origin of @xmath15 .",
    "it is therefore natural to identify the outcome set as a subset of complex projective space , @xmath19 .",
    "a set of equiangular lines @xmath20 , @xmath21 for all @xmath22 , is then a type of _ complex projective code _ , called a _ @xmath23 1-distance set _ ( see e.g.  refs .",
    "it is known that any such @xmath24 obeys the so - called absolute bound on its size : @xmath25 .",
    "the maximum requires the same common angle enjoyed by sic - povms .",
    "alternatively , in terms of line packings , for any set @xmath26 of size @xmath27 , it is known that @xmath28 with equality only if @xmath29 is equiangular  @xcite .",
    "a dual characterisation of sic - povms comes from design theory ( see e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite or sec .  2 of ref .",
    "@xcite for a concise introduction )",
    ". a finite set @xmath30 is called a _",
    "complex projective @xmath31-design _ if @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the haar measure . in these terms , sic - povms are precisely equivalent to _ tight _ complex projective 2-designs .",
    "these are 2-designs that meet the absolute bound on their size : @xmath34 .",
    "all 2-designs with @xmath35 are necessarily sets of equiangular lines and these are the only 2-designs with this structure .",
    "this characterisation has a straightforward generalisation in terms of _ weighted @xmath31-designs _",
    "@xcite or _ cubature formulas _  @xcite .",
    "a third characterisation of sic - povms is in terms of frame theory ( see e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in this context , a set of unit vectors that specifies a sic - povm , @xmath36 , is called a maximally equiangular tight frame  @xcite .",
    "more importantly , under the projection @xmath37 into the real vector space of traceless hermitian operators ( the natural generalisation of the bloch - sphere representation to higher dimensions  @xcite ) a sic - povm again maps to a tight frame ( in this case a simplex ) , which means the representation @xmath38 is afforded by any quantum state @xmath39 ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for descriptions of such _ tight _ informationally complete povms ) .",
    "this state - inversion formula for @xmath39 in terms of its measurement statistics @xmath40 immediately proves _ informational completeness _",
    "@xcite for sic - povms .",
    "moreover , amongst all _ minimally _ informationally complete povms ( i.e.  those having @xmath0 outcomes ) , this representation is unique to sic - povms .",
    "these considerations have lead some to argue  @xcite that sic - povms should be promoted to the unique status of _ standard _ informationally complete povms , being as close as possible to orthonormal bases for the space of quantum states .",
    "indeed , sic - povms would be the best choice in any bid to standardise experimental reporting in quantum state tomography , being the most robust minimally informationally complete povms against statistical error  @xcite .",
    "the most promising route towards a general construction of sic - povms involves translating a fiducial vector under the _ weyl displacement operators _",
    "@xcite : @xmath41 where @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 ( meaning @xmath45 ) , and we have fixed an orthonormal basis for @xmath15 : @xmath46 . defining the symplectic form @xmath47 these operators obey the relations @xmath48 and together generate a variant of the _ heisenberg group _ :",
    "@xmath49 modulo its center , @xmath50 , the heisenberg group is simply a direct product of cyclic groups , @xmath51 , where @xmath52 .",
    "it was conjectured in ref .",
    "@xcite that , in every finite dimension , a sic - povm can be constructed as the orbit of a suitable _ fiducial vector _",
    "@xmath53 under the action of the displacement operators : @xmath54 the condition for equiangularity ( [ eq : sic ] ) then becomes latexmath:[\\ ] ] where @xmath141\\coloneq \\{e^{i\\xi}u\\}_{\\xi\\in\\r}$ ] .",
    "we then have @xmath151 , giving @xmath152 which is @xmath153 unique sic - povms in dimension 15 , for example .",
    "the stabiliser of each orbit is also given in table  [ tbl : symmetries ] .",
    "the numerical initial fiducial vector @xmath69 and its stabiliser @xmath154 were always chosen in a way that the stabiliser elements take the form @xmath155 ( recall that @xmath156 $ ] ) and , therefore , only the matrices @xmath157 are quoted .",
    "the number of stabilised fiducial vectors in each orbit is also provided , which is further divided into the number of stabilised sic - povms times the number of stabilised vectors per sic - povm . for example , @xmath158 contains 24 sic - povms stabilised by @xmath159 , each containing 3 stabilised vectors ; @xmath160 contains 12 sic - povms stabilised by @xmath161 , each containing a single stabilised vector .    in agreement with appleby s analysis  @xcite of the previous solutions  @xcite , in dimensions",
    "@xmath162 each stabiliser of the new solutions is a cyclic group of order a multiple of 3 , and the vast majority , up to group conjugacy , have the symmetry described by zauner s order-3 unitary @xmath163 , where ( eq .  ( [ eq : fz ] ) )",
    "@xmath164 exceptions occur in dimensions @xmath165 , @xmath166 , @xmath167 , @xmath168 , @xmath169 , @xmath170 , in which case solutions stabilised by the order-3 unitary @xmath171 exist , as indicated in parentheses , where @xmath172 the solution @xmath173 was known previously  @xcite , but the remaining are new . following appleby  @xcite , call an order-3 ( unitary ) element @xmath174 _ canonical _ if @xmath175 and @xmath176 .",
    "note that zauner s unitary @xmath163 is canonical . in fact",
    ", it can be shown that all other canonical elements are conjugate to it when @xmath177 ; otherwise , there are exactly two conjugacy classes of canonical elements in @xmath178 , containing @xmath163 and @xmath171 , respectively .",
    "order-3 canonical unitaries are therefore special , in that , in the dimensions tested , every such unitary stabilises a fiducial vector .    we can deduce two more general symmetries present in the new solutions : in dimensions @xmath179 , @xmath180 , @xmath181 , @xmath182 , @xmath183 , @xmath184 , the order-2 permutation @xmath185 , where @xmath186 stabilises the solutions indicated ; in dimensions @xmath187 , @xmath188 , @xmath189 , @xmath190 , @xmath191 , the order-2 anti - unitary @xmath192 , where @xmath193 stabilises the solutions indicated . as with zauner s symmetry ,",
    "the reason for these extra symmetries is unknown , but their existence assists the discovery of new analytical solutions .    in table",
    "[ tbl : zsymmetries ] we list the total number of fiducial vectors stabilised by zauner s unitary matrix @xmath194 in terms of fiducial - vector orbits .",
    "the number of fiducial vectors contained in each @xmath57-eigenspace is also given ( @xmath61 is as defined above eq .",
    "( [ eq : zeignenspaces ] ) ) , which is further divided into the number of @xmath57-stabilised sic - povms times the number of @xmath57-stabilised vectors per sic - povm .",
    "the latter is 3 when @xmath195 , and 1 otherwise .",
    "the vectors tend to populate the largest eigenspace(s ) only .",
    "this is @xmath196 , except in dimensions @xmath197 , where @xmath196 and @xmath198 have the same largest dimension .",
    "the @xmath57-stabilised vectors then divide evenly between these eigenspaces .",
    "exceptions to this rule occur in dimensions @xmath199 , @xmath200 , @xmath201 , @xmath202 , @xmath203 , @xmath204 , where orbits exist containing only @xmath57-stabilised vectors from @xmath205 , as indicated in parentheses .",
    "it is of some interest whether real fiducial vectors exist  @xcite .",
    "a search through our orbits shows that , for @xmath3 , these exist only in dimensions @xmath206 , @xmath188 , @xmath207 and @xmath208 , of which , those in dimension 39 are new .",
    "since @xmath209 , examples from each of the two orbits can be found by multiplying the vectors given in appendix  [ app : numerics ] by the unitary @xmath210 .    also of interest",
    "are schmidt decompositions of the fiducial vectors for different bipartitions @xmath211 , where @xmath212 are coprime , under the identification @xmath213 .",
    "this choice preserves group covariance of sic - povms by realising the group isomorphism @xmath214  @xcite .",
    "given the singular value decomposition of the @xmath215 matrix @xmath216 ( complex conjugation in the standard basis ) , the schmidt decomposition of @xmath69 is defined as @xmath217 where the @xmath218 are called schmidt coefficients .",
    "when @xmath219 ( and , therefore , @xmath220 must be odd ) , these coefficients can be calculated independently of the fiducial state , @xmath221 , leading to some interest in the approach  @xcite .",
    "this is because , along with normalisation @xmath222 , the schmidt coefficients always satisfy @xmath223 using group covariance ( where the displacement @xmath224 acts on @xmath225 ) , the property of 2-designs [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : tdesign ] ) ] , and ref .",
    "@xcite to evaluate the integral .",
    "some other special schmidt coefficients are apparent from our solutions ( to the numerical precision given ) : when @xmath226 , we find that @xmath227 in dimension @xmath228 , @xmath229 in dimension @xmath230 , and @xmath231 in dimension @xmath232 ; when @xmath233 , we find @xmath234 in dimension @xmath235 .",

    "algebraic solutions for weyl - heisenberg sic - povms have been reported by zauner  @xcite for dimensions @xmath240 , together with a solution for @xmath241 due to hoggar @xcite which is covariant with respect to the three - qubit pauli group .",
    "appleby  @xcite added weyl - heisenberg solutions for @xmath242 and @xmath243 .",
    "the second author has reported on algebraic solutions for dimension @xmath244 and @xmath245 in a series of conference talks @xcite . here",
    "we close the gap at @xmath246 and add new solutions for @xmath247 .    the general approach used for finding algebraic solutions",
    "is to solve the system of polynomial equations for a fiducial vector that lies in an eigenspace of a prescribed symmetry , for example , the zauner matrix ( see e.g.  @xcite for more details ) .",
    "the smaller the dimension of the eigenspace , the fewer the variables that are needed , and the higher the chances are of being able to compute a solution .",
    "the new solutions for @xmath247 have been obtained with the help of the comparatively large symmetry groups identified in these dimensions , upon inspection of the numerical solutions .    in order to be able to express the hermitian inner product and the squared modulus via polynomials , we have to replace each complex variable @xmath248 by two real variables , i.e. , @xmath249 where @xmath250 .",
    "in general , the resulting system of polynomial equations will have both real and complex solutions for the variables @xmath251 and @xmath252 , but we are only interested in those solutions for which all components are real .    note that in an algebraic extension of the rationals @xmath253 , there is no _ a priori _ notion of an element being _ positive _ or _ real_. an element @xmath254 , for example , which is defined via @xmath255 can either be mapped to @xmath256 or @xmath257 .",
    "furthermore , the roots of @xmath258 are @xmath259 . depending on the choice of the sign of @xmath260",
    ", @xmath261 is mapped to a real or a complex number .",
    "now assume that we are given a number field @xmath262 where @xmath263 is a root of an irreducible polynomial @xmath264 $ ] of degree @xmath265 with rational coefficients . without loss of generality , we additionally assume that @xmath266 contains a square root of @xmath267",
    ". we can then identify a subfield @xmath268 such that @xmath269 with @xmath270 and @xmath271 with @xmath272 for an irreducible polynomial @xmath273 $ ] of degree @xmath274 that has at least one real root . a field",

    ", a field automorphism of @xmath266 that commutes with the `` complex conjugation '' @xmath276 and stabilises the weyl - heisenberg group as a set , maps a weyl - heisenberg sic - povm to a possibly different weyl - heisenberg sic - povm .    using the computer algebra system magma @xcite , we have computed at least one fiducial vector for dimensions @xmath279 .",
    "the symbolical fiducial vectors can be found in appendix  [ app : symbolics ] . while the labeling of the orbits is the same as that introduced for the numerical fiducial vectors , the vectors themselves are not necessarily the very same as those given in appendix  [ app : numerics ] .",
    "their lengths are also unnormalised .",
    "note that in addition to basic arithmetic operations we need only to compute square roots , and third or fifth roots .",
    "this is related to the fact that in all cases for which we have been able to compute a solution , the solution can be found in a number field with solvable galois group , and hence the field extension can be expressed in terms of radicals .    as an intermediate step ,",
    "we compute a so - called grbner basis @xmath280 of the ideal generated by the system of polynomial equations .",
    "unfortunately , the polynomials in @xmath280 tend to have large coefficients , and in some cases even a couple of hundred digits , e.g.  for @xmath281 .",
    "likewise , the defining polynomials of the number field containing a solution quite often have large degrees and huge coefficients . in most of the cases , we succeeded in computing a more compact representation of the solution based on the non - unique decomposition of the field . in table",
    "[ tbl : fields ] we give the degree of the number field over which a fiducial vector has been found and which contains the square root @xmath277 of @xmath267 as canonical generator for the extension @xmath282 .",
    "note that this field does not necessarily contain a primitive @xmath1-th root of unity .",
    "one such example is @xmath243 , where the extension degree is @xmath283 , but a @xmath8-th root of unity is defined by an irreducible polynomial of degree @xmath284 .",
    "hence the overall extension degree is at least @xmath285 . in some other cases ,",
    "the field is not closed under all possible automorphisms induced by mapping one root of the defining polynomial to another . in those cases ,",

    "fiducial vectors of both orbits labeled @xmath287 and @xmath288 can be found in an eigenspace of the zauner matrix , and they are defined over the same number field @xmath289 where @xmath290 and @xmath291 are roots of the polynomials @xmath292 and @xmath293 , respectively .",
    "it turns out that the following automorphism of @xmath294 connects the two orbits : @xmath295 and fixes @xmath290 , @xmath291 and @xmath277 .",
    "note that the change of signs of the square roots of @xmath296 and @xmath297 implies the mapping for @xmath298 , since the defining polynomial of @xmath298 then changes as well .",
    "the set of triple products @xmath299 computed for all triples of states in a single weyl - heisenberg orbit , however , is not invariant under @xmath300 .",
    "this implies that the two orbits are not related by a unitary or anti - unitary transformation ( see ref .",
    "similarly , the two orbits @xmath301 and @xmath302 are related by a field automorphism of order @xmath283 , implied by simultaneously changing the signs of @xmath303 and @xmath304 . for dimension @xmath305 ,",
    "the orbits @xmath306 and @xmath307 are related by a field automorphism of order @xmath283 , implied by simultaneously changing the signs of @xmath256 and @xmath308 , while the orbit @xmath309 is unrelated to them .",
    "the orbits @xmath310 and @xmath311 are related by simultaneously changing the signs of @xmath308 and @xmath303 .",
    "it is not yet clear to us when such a relation exists . unlike complex conjugation ,",
    "which is intrinsic to the problem and captured by the extended clifford group , we can not predict which other field automorphisms relate the different orbits since we know the relevant number field only after having found a solution .",
    "ten years have now passed since it was first conjectured , by gerhard zauner  @xcite , that maximal sets of @xmath0 equiangular lines exist in all finite complex dimensions @xmath1 . despite considerable attention",
    "now attracted to this question from the quantum physics community , where sets of @xmath0 equiangular lines define sic - povms  @xcite , zauner s conjecture remains open to this day .",
    "the primary purpose of this article is to report the results of the authors new computer study on sic - povms : numerical solutions for fiducial vectors that generate weyl - heisenberg covariant sic - povms are provided in appendix  [ app : numerics ] for all @xmath2 .",
    "these confirm zauner s conjecture in all such dimensions , except @xmath312 , which remains inconclusive .",
    "moreover , a putatively complete list of solutions is given for @xmath3 .",
    "it is our hope that this list will act as an important resource for the growing community of researchers interested in the sic - povm problem .",
    "a preliminary symmetry analysis has lead to new algebraic solutions in dimensions @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "these are collected with other known weyl - heisenberg covariant algebraic solutions in appendix  [ app : symbolics ] ( see also ref .",
    "additional symmetries are likely to exist in arbitrarily large dimensions , and might help in proving the existence of an infinite series of corresponding sic - povms .",
    "although our confidence in its truth has grown considerably , we seem no closer to a proof of zauner s conjecture than gerhard zauner was at the time of his doctoral dissertation .",
    "the observation by zauner , and subsequently by others , of the apparent deep connection between the heisenberg group and maximal sets of equiangular lines , appears to be born more out of luck than discernment .",
    "our incomplete understanding of the automorphism group of weyl - heisenberg covariant sic - povms is most impoverishing : simplifying to prime dimensions , although the outer automorphism group of @xmath65 is @xmath313 , only members of the subgroup @xmath314 are currently known to naturally define automorphisms of weyl - heisenberg sic - povms ( as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : whsics ] ) .",
    "the relation found in dimension @xmath286 between the two different extended clifford orbits of solutions ( labeled @xmath287 and @xmath288 ) hints of a bigger picture that could paint currently unrelated orbits in the same light ( see sec .",

    "<S> we report on a new computer study into the existence of @xmath0 equiangular lines in @xmath1 complex dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> such maximal complex projective codes are conjectured to exist in all finite dimensions and are the underlying mathematical objects defining symmetric informationally complete measurements in quantum theory . </S>",
