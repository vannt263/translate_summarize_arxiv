    "one of the main research lines in quantum chaos is to investigate the statistics of energy levels of quantum systems whose classical counterpart is chaotic .",
    "a very popular class of systems are euclidean billiards which are classically given by the free motion inside a domain @xmath0 with elastic reflections at the boundary @xmath1 .",
    "the corresponding quantum billiard is described by the stationary schrdinger equation ( @xmath2 ) @xmath3 with dirichlet boundary conditions @xmath4 for .",
    "it has been conjectured that the energy level statistics of integrable systems can be described by a poissonian random process @xcite , whereas classically strongly chaotic systems should obey the statistics of random matrix ensembles like the goe or gue @xcite .",
    "this implies for example that the nearest neighbor level spacing distribution is expected to show level repulsion for chaotic systems , in contrast to integrable systems which are expected to show level attraction .",
    "surprisingly , this means that the statistics of classically chaotic systems are much more rigid than those of integrable systems .",
    "these conjectures have been tested successfully for several systems . however , there are exceptions for both integrable and chaotic systems . for example",
    "the so - called arithmetic systems , which are strongly chaotic , are found to have a level spacing distribution showing level - attraction similar to the poissonian distribution @xcite .",
    "therefore a different statistics , the distribution of the normalized mode fluctuations has been proposed @xcite as a possible signature of quantum chaos .",
    "this statistics was first investigated in the integrable case for the eigenvalues of the laplacian on a torus @xcite and later in @xcite the unnormalized fluctuations , possessing no limit distribution , have been studied for regular and chaotic billiards . for chaotic systems",
    "the limit distribution of the normalized mode fluctuations is conjectured @xcite to show a universal gaussian , whereas integrable systems should exhibit a non - gaussian limit distribution .",
    "this conjecture was tested successfully for several regular and chaotic billiard systems in @xcite .    by using two - dimensional microwave cavities quantum billiards",
    "can be simulated experimentally @xcite .",
    "this is possible because of the equivalence of the stationary schrdinger equation for quantum billiards and the corresponding helmholtz equation for electromagnetic resonators in two dimensions . in three dimensions the electromagnetic helmholtz equation is vectorial and",
    "can not be reduced to an effective scalar form .",
    "thus , it is structurally different from the scalar schrdinger equation",
    ". nevertheless the applicability of the statistical concepts developed in the theory of quantum chaos and random matrix theory is also given for such three - dimensional systems @xcite .",
    "therefore experiments with superconducting microwave resonators provide in general eigenvalue spectra of very high resolution for which an analysis of the distribution of the normalized mode fluctuations is interesting .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ modefl ] the mode fluctuation distribution is introduced .",
    "the experimental set - up and the measurement of the eigenfrequencies using superconducting microwave resonators are described in sec .",
    "[ experiment ] . in sec .",
    "[ application ] the analysis of the mode fluctuation distribution using the experimental data is carried out .",
    "the analysis of the eigenvalue spectrum starts with the spectral staircase function @xmath5 which counts the number of energy levels below a given energy @xmath6 .",
    "the mean behavior of @xmath7 is given by the generalized weyl s law @xcite , which reads for two - dimensional billiards with dirichlet boundary conditions @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the area of the billiard , @xmath10 the length of the boundary , and @xmath11 takes curvature and corner contributions into account .",
    "for three - dimensional electrodynamical billiards we have @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the volume of the billiard , @xmath14 the mean radius of the curvature over the surface @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the dihedral angle along the edges @xmath17 @xcite .    in order to obtain a spectrum which is independent of the system specific constants ,",
    "one considers the unfolded spectrum @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "consequently the unfolded energy spectrum has a mean level spacing of unity .",
    "the counting function for the unfolded spectrum will be denoted for simplicity again by @xmath19 .",
    "thus the fluctuating part of the spectral staircase function is given by @xmath20 in the following we will assume that all spectra have been unfolded and that the systems are completely desymmetrized .",
    "the normalized mode fluctuations are given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the variance @xmath23 ^ 2 \\ ; { \\mbox{\\rm d}}y \\;\\;,\\ ] ] with @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is a correction necessary for integrable systems to obtain for @xmath26 a variance of one , see @xcite for details .",
    "the conjecture put forward in @xcite can be formulated as follows ( see @xcite ) :    _ for bound conservative and scaling systems the quantity @xmath26 , eq .",
    "( [ w(x)-def ] ) , possesses a limit distribution for @xmath27 .",
    "this distribution is absolutely continuous with respect to the lebesgue measure on the real line , with a density @xmath28 defined by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a bounded continuous function , and @xmath31 is a continuous density on @xmath32 $ ] with @xmath33 . _    furthermore , the limit distribution has zero mean and unit variance , @xmath34    now , the basic conjecture of @xcite reads as follows : _ if the corresponding classical system is strongly chaotic , having only isolated and unstable periodic orbits , then @xmath28 is universally a gaussian , @xmath35 in contrast , a classically integrable system leads to a non - gaussian density @xmath28 .",
    "_    for large classes of integrable systems it has been proven that the limit distribution is not gaussian , see @xcite and references therein .    for chaotic systems",
    "this conjecture has been tested numerically in @xcite , and experimentally in @xcite . a review and",
    "a detailed comparison between chaotic and non - chaotic systems is given in @xcite .",
    "a gaussian distribution for chaotic systems corresponds to maximum randomness for the fluctuations , whereas the mode fluctuation distribution for integrable systems is less random @xcite .",
    "berry s semiclassical analysis @xcite gives results for the asymptotic behavior of the saturation behavior of the spectral rigidity . in a similar way one can determine the asymptotic behavior of @xmath22 . for generic integrable",
    "billiards one has @xmath36 for generic classically chaotic systems with anti - unitary symmetry ( e.g. time  reversal symmetry ) one obtains @xmath37    as discussed in @xcite one can extend the conjecture to such chaotic systems , for which @xmath38 is modulated by a long range oscillation @xmath39 . in this case one has to include the additional term in the unfolding process , @xmath40 .",
    "this procedure has been used for instance in the case of the truncated hyperbola billiard , where a prominent contribution to @xmath7 is given by families of closed non - periodic orbits running into a boundary point where the curvature is discontinuous @xcite ; see @xcite for the result of @xmath28 for this system .",
    "the same is also necessary for the stadium billiard , where a family of marginally stable orbits , the bouncing ball orbits ( bbo ) gives rise to a strong modulation @xcite .",
    "taking the contribution of the bbo into account one observes excellent agreement of @xmath28 with the gaussian normal distribution @xcite .",
    "for a precise test of the distribution of the normalized mode fluctuations an accurate measurement of the resonances of all investigated microwave billiards is necessary . since 1991 , we have experimentally studied several two- and three - dimensional systems using superconducting microwave resonators of niobium . in fig .",
    "1 the shapes of some measured billiards with their dimensions are shown . altogether",
    "five desymmetrized two - dimensional systems are investigated : a @xmath41 bunimovich stadium billiard @xcite , a circular billiard ( not desymmetrized ) and three members of the family of limaon billiards , which have first been theoretically studied as billiards in @xcite .",
    "their boundary is defined as the quadratic conformal map of the unit disc onto the complex @xmath42-plane : @xmath43 , where @xmath44 $ ] controls the chaoticity of the system .",
    "the billiards of the limaon family are also called pascalian snails , their shape has already been mentioned by a.  drer in 1525 @xcite .",
    "we also analyzed a desymmetrized three - dimensional sinai billiard @xcite .",
    "the measurements were carried out in a lhe - bath cryostat .",
    "the billiards were excited up to a frequency of , the upper limit of the used hp8510b vector network analyzer , using four capacitively coupling dipole antennas sitting in small holes on the niobium surface and penetrating up to a maximum of 1 mm into the cavity to avoid disturbances of the electromagnetic field inside the resonators . using one antenna for the excitation and either another or the same one for the detection of the microwave signal , we were able to measure the transmission or the reflection spectrum of the resonators .",
    "the spectra were taken in 10 khz - steps and the measured resonances have quality factors of up to @xmath45 and signal - to - noise ratios of up to which made it easy to separate the resonances from each other and from the background even in the higher frequency range , where the level density strongly increases . especially in the case of the circular billiard with mainly twofold degenerated resonances the advantage of using superconducting cavities is obvious . due to mechanical imperfections",
    "the degenerated modes show a very weak splitting , but nevertheless one is able to resolve all resonances . as a consequence , all the important characteristics like eigenfrequencies and widths could be extracted with a very high accuracy @xcite . a detailed analysis of the original spectra yields a total number of 1000 - 1200 resonances for the 2d - billiards ( about 660 resonances for the circular billiard ) , and nearly 1900 resonances for the 3d - billiard .",
    "a detailed comparison with numerical data confirms that the measured spectra are almost complete @xcite .",
    "these eigenvalue sequences @xmath46 ( with @xmath47 and @xmath48 is the speed of light ) form the basis of the present test of the mode fluctuation distribution .",
    "[ htb ]    = 8.6 cm",
    "in this section we study the mode fluctuation distribution discussed in sec .",
    "[ modefl ] for the experimentally investigated systems presented in sec .",
    "[ experiment ] .",
    "first we want to discuss the results for the @xmath41 stadium billiard .",
    "as proven in @xcite the stadium billiard is strongly chaotic ( i.e.  ergodic , mixing , k - system ) .",
    "ergodicity , however , does not prevent a system from having a family of marginally stable periodic orbits , as long as they are of measure zero in phase space . in the stadium billiard",
    "such a family is given by the bouncing ball orbits ( bbo ) , which have perpendicular reflections at the straight line segments .",
    "their contribution dominates the fluctuating part of the spectral staircase function @xcite .",
    "therefore the above stated conjecture is in its basic form not applicable ( see however the refinement given in @xcite and the discussion below ) .",
    "after unfolding the spectrum and calculating the distribution of the normalized mode fluctuation @xmath26 according to eq .",
    "( [ w(x)-def ] ) and ( [ temporal - variance ] ) , a density @xmath28 results as shown in the left part of fig .  2 .",
    "obviously it is not a gaussian , the distribution is shifted to positive @xmath26 due to the existence of the bbo .",
    "in fact , in @xcite it is shown using the results of @xcite that in this case @xmath26 is a bounded function , such that the limit distribution @xmath28 is not gaussian .",
    "= 8.6 cm    since @xmath28 is expected to show gaussian behavior only if the corresponding classical system is strongly chaotic excluding stable or neutrally stable motion , the contribution of the bbo has to be taken into account in the unfolding procedure @xcite , see sec .",
    "[ modefl ] .",
    "finally , the predicted gaussian distribution of @xmath28 is obtained , as can be seen in the right part of fig .  2 .",
    "to have a measure how good the distribution @xmath28 agrees with a gaussian we use the kolmogorov - smirnov test , which gives a significance level computed from the maximum value of the absolute difference between the two cumulative distributions .",
    "for the case with bbo one obtains a significance level of @xmath49 and for the case with extracted bbo of @xmath50 .",
    "the influence of the bbo which are visible in the distributions in fig .  2",
    "is also reflected in the value of the significance level .    to determine the normalized mode fluctuations , eq .",
    "( [ w(x)-def ] ) , we have calculated the fluctuating part @xmath51 of the unfolded experimental spectra according to eq .",
    "( [ n_fluc ] ) . for the variance @xmath22 , eq .",
    "( [ temporal - variance ] ) , we have used the ansatz for bbo - contribution included and after their extraction , see sec .",
    "[ modefl ] .",
    "then @xmath26 was calculated for @xmath52 to @xmath53 randomly distributed values of @xmath54 in the interval @xmath55 $ ] , with @xmath56 being the upper unfolded eigenenergy .",
    "the constant term in @xmath22 was chosen according to eq .",
    "( [ 1st-2nd - moment ] ) to give a unit variance for the obtained distribution @xmath28 .",
    "these results using the experimentally determined set of energy levels confirm our previous analysis using the numerically computed eigenspectrum @xcite .",
    "another investigated system where the bouncing ball orbits play an important role is the 3d - sinai billiard , which is also proven to be strongly chaotic @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the 2d - bunimovich stadium billiard the 3d - sinai billiard possesses families of bbo of dimension two and three . in fig .",
    "3 the mode fluctuation distributions with and without bbo are displayed . in the distribution with bbo ( left part of fig .",
    "3 ) only slight deviations from the gaussian occur , in particular a significant peak at @xmath57 appears .",
    "thus the influence of the bbo is less visible in the considered energy range as in the case of the distribution for the @xmath41 stadium billiard which might be due to the superpositions of different bbo .",
    "this confirms our previous results of @xcite.taking into account the contribution of the bbo modes one obtains the right part of fig .",
    "3 . calculating the significance level for the first case ( with bbo ) one obtains a value of @xmath58 and for the second case ( with extracted bbo ) of @xmath50 .",
    "= 8.6 cm      in this section we test the conjecture stated in sec .  [ modefl ] for the billiards of the limaon family .",
    "we have investigated three billiards of different chaoticity with parameters @xmath59 .",
    "investigations of the classical poincar surface of section for these configurations have shown @xcite that the fraction of the chaotic phase space is @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) , @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) and nearly @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "the quantum mechanical counterpart of these three billiards exhibit the same behavior concerning their chaoticity @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "therefore they are very suitable to study the conjecture .",
    "note that the classical dynamics of the @xmath65 billiard is not completely ergodic , since small stability islands still exist @xcite , see also @xcite for analytical results around @xmath66 .",
    "however the corresponding islands of stability are so small that they do not affect the energy spectrum in the range under consideration .",
    "= 8.6 cm    as can be seen in fig .",
    "4 the billiard with @xmath65 shows indeed the predicted gaussian distribution @xmath28 . for the calculation of @xmath28 we followed the same procedure described for the stadium billiard with an ansatz for the variance  . on the other hand",
    "the two billiards with @xmath61 and @xmath63 belong to the class of mixed systems .",
    "their classical counterparts possess aside from isolated and unstable periodic orbits also stable orbits @xcite . from this",
    "one would expect , that according to this the distribution @xmath28 should show non - gaussian behavior .",
    "however , the histograms in fig .  4 , obtained with assuming @xmath67 , which gives a good description for @xmath22 in the considered enery interval , allow no significant distinction between @xmath28 and the gaussian distribution , see also the lower part of fig .  4 , where the difference @xmath68 between a gaussian and the calculated distribution @xmath28 is shown .",
    "these characteristics are also expressed in the significance levels obtained from the kolmogorov - smirnov test which lie around @xmath69 .",
    "presumably one needs a large number of energy levels to be able to see significant deviations .",
    "finally we have studied the mode fluctuation distribution for the circular billiard .",
    "since this system is integrable , one would expect a deviation of the mode fluctuation distribution from a gaussian due to the existence of neutrally stable periodic orbits . to obtain the distribution",
    "@xmath28 we use the ansatz for the variance @xmath70 . in fig .  5",
    "the distribution @xmath28 is shown , which clearly deviates from the gaussian . for the circular billiard one obtains a significance level of @xmath71 .",
    "this result is in contrast to the result of @xcite , where no difference between the mode fluctuation distribution for the numerical obtained eigenmodes of a regular system and a gaussian for chaotic systems could be found , although nearly the same number of eigenfrequencies ( @xmath72 ) are used .",
    "in this paper we have studied the distribution of the normalized mode fluctuations for experimentally obtained high resolution eigenvalue spectra of several two- and three - dimensional superconducting microwave billiards .",
    "the conjecture for this statistical measure states that the distribution @xmath28 of the normalized mode fluctuations for a given eigenvalue spectrum leads to a gaussian when the corresponding classical system is strongly chaotic having only unstable and isolated periodic orbits .",
    "this has been successfully tested using the eigenvalues of a @xmath41 stadium billiard and a 3d - sinai billiard .",
    "both systems are strongly chaotic , but possess families of bouncing ball orbits , whose contribution has been subtracted for the determination of @xmath28 .",
    "the same result has been obtained with a @xmath65 billiard of the limaon family .",
    "two other investigated billiards of the limaon family , the @xmath61 and @xmath63 billiard , belong to the class of mixed systems .",
    "the fact that no visible difference from a gaussian occurs in the distribution @xmath28 might be due to the finite number of eigenvalues in the given energy range we used to calculate the distribution and the chaoticities of the systems ( 55% resp .",
    "66% ) which are closer to chaotic than to regular dynamics .",
    "a variation of the included number of modes ( 500 , 600 , ... , 1100 ) in the mode fluctuation distribution shows no significant change in the results . in the case of the circular billiard",
    "we get a clear deviation from the gaussian , as one would expect .",
    "this is in contrast to the result of @xcite , where no such difference for a regular system could be found .",
    "therefore characterizing the chaoticity using a small number of energy levels with the help of the conjecture stated in @xcite is very difficult . for regular resp .",
    "chaotic systems the reachable number of eigenvalues obtained by experiments explained in sec .",
    "[ experiment ] is sufficient to have satisfactory results for the mode fluctuation distribution .",
    "but for special regular ( rectangular billiards @xcite ) or mixed systems the needed number of eigenvalues , approximately @xmath73 , can experimentally only hardly be achieved , so that a practical usage of this conjecture to obtain informations about the chaoticity of such systems is limited .",

    "<S> high resolution eigenvalue spectra of several two- and three - dimensional superconducting microwave cavities have been measured in the frequency range below 20 ghz and analyzed using a statistical measure which is given by the distribution of the normalized mode fluctuations . for chaotic systems </S>",
    "<S> the limit distribution is conjectured to show a universal gaussian , whereas integrable systems should exhibit a non - gaussian limit distribution . for the investigated bunimovich stadium and the 3d - sinai billiard </S>",
    "<S> we find that the distribution is in good agreement with this prediction . </S>",
    "<S> we study members of the family of limaon billiards , having mixed dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that in this case the number of approximately 1000 eigenvalues for each billiard does not allow to observe significant deviations from a gaussian , whereas an also measured circular billiard with regular dynamics shows the expected difference from a gaussian .    2 </S>"
