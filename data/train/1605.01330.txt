    "in the most basic model of communication , a sender attempts to communicate with a receiver over a noisy channel , with the goal of achieving _ reliability _ : the receiver should be able to recover the intended message even in the presence of noise .",
    "the wiretap channel , introduced in  @xcite , adds a wiretapper or eavesdropper to the model .",
    "the wiretapper also has access to a noisy version of the sender s transmission , and now the sender also wants to achieve _ secrecy _ : the wiretapper should not learn anything about the intended message .",
    "( these notions will be made precise later . ) typically , the sender is connected to both the receiver and wiretapper by a memoryless broadcast channel , and the dual goals of reliability and secrecy can be met with positive communication rate when the channel to the wiretapper is `` noisier '' than that to the receiver .    in this work ,",
    "we consider the extension of the wiretap model to the adversarial setting .",
    "we not only allow the wiretapper to choose an arbitrary @xmath0 fraction of transmitted symbols to read ( this is the `` wiretap channel ii '' model of ozarow and wyner  ( @xcite ) ) , but also allow the wiretapper to choose an arbitrary @xmath1 fraction of errors to add to the transmission before it reaches the receiver .",
    "we refer to this model as the @xmath4 adversarial wiretap channel .",
    "an incomplete survey of related models and results appears in section  [ sec : prev ] ; this particular model and the name `` adversarial wiretap channel '' were introduced in  @xcite along with an explicit construction for large alphabets .",
    "the authors of  @xcite also show that the capacity of such a channel is at most @xmath5 .",
    "the model of the adversarial wiretap channel represents a natural middle ground between truly adversarial errors ( i.e.  @xmath6 , when the adversary has full knowledge of what is being transmitted ) and fully oblivious errors  ( i.e.  @xmath7 , defined in  @xcite ) , where the adversary has no knowledge of which codeword is being transmitted , but can add arbitrary errors to the codeword . in that respect it is related to the more abstract model of @xmath8-oblivious channels due to  @xcite , where , loosely , the parameter @xmath8 controls how much the channel knows about the transmitted codeword ( see also the discussion in section  [ sec : prev ] ) .",
    "the main theorem of this work is the following , which bounds the rate of a binary code which simultaneously achieves reliability and secrecy in the adversarial wiretap model .",
    "the capacity of the @xmath4 adversarial wiretap channel is at least @xmath9 .",
    "loosely , the loss of @xmath0 in the achievable rate is required to achieve secrecy , and can be matched in constructions by adding some pseudorandom noise to the transmitted symbols .",
    "the loss of @xmath10 in the rate then corresponds to what is necessary to correct a @xmath1 fraction of errors .",
    "the challenge faced by previous work such as  @xcite is that the best known rate for correcting an _ arbitrary _",
    "@xmath1 error fraction is @xmath11 for binary codes . however , there are a few cases when we can achieve a rate of @xmath12 against a @xmath1 fraction of errors , most notably in the case of _ random _ errors ( @xcite ) , and for oblivious errors ( @xcite ) .",
    "the main point of our achievability analysis , which uses random coding , is that the adversary s errors must behave like random or oblivious errors , even with the auxiliary knowledge of a @xmath0 fraction of the codeword .",
    "this allows us to show that correcting such errors only requires a @xmath10 loss in the achievable rate , allowing for a final rate of @xmath2 .",
    "this recalls the work of  @xcite ( `` sufficiently myopic adversaries are blind '' ) , and indeed we build on their techniques to show that the adversary is still `` blind '' after reading his choice of symbols .",
    "our result improves on previous known bounds for binary codes , and comes close to matching the upper bound on achievable rate induced by the random wiretap channel ( theorem  [ thm : rand - cap ] ) when @xmath0 is small .      in section  [ sec : prelim ] , we define some terminology relating to the adversarial wiretap model , including the capacity , and build on this to discuss related work . in section",
