    "they found that a double diffusive instability referred to as thermohaline convection , which has been discussed long ago in the literature ( stern 1960 ) , is important in evolution of red giants .",
    "this mixing connects the convective envelope with the external wing of hydrogen burning shell and induces surface abundance modifications in red giant stars ( lagarde & charbonnel 2009 ) .    in our @xmath0 and stellar mass plot ( fig .",

    "cantiello & langer ( 2010 ) reported that thermohaline mixing is also present in red giants during core he - burning and beyond .",
    "the comparison with theoretical models shows that according to @xmath0 isotope ratios , the stars fall into two groups : the one with carbon isotope ratios altered according to the 1@xmath46 dredge - up prediction , and the other one with carbon isotope ratios altered by extra mixing .",

    "et al .  ( 2006 ) , according to nitrogen abundance values , the authors have suggested 21 helium - core - burning stars , about 54 candidates to helium - core - burning stars and about 100 first ascent giants .      in this work we present @xmath0 determinations in a sample of 34 galactic clump stars as well as abundances of nitrogen ,",
    "carbon and oxygen , obtained using high - resolution spectra observed on the nordic optical telescope ( @xmath11 ) and at the beijing astronomical observatory ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the obtained stellar abundances together with results of other studies of galactic clump stars ( mishenina et al .",
    "2006 ; liu et al .  2007 and luck & heiter 2007 ) and of red - horizontal - branch stars ( tautvaiien et al .",
    "2001 and gratton et al .",
    "2000 ) were compared with determinations of c , n and o abundances in dwarf stars of the galactic disk .",
    "the mean abundances in the investigated clump stars suggest that carbon is depleted by about 0.2  dex , nitrogen is enhanced by 0.2  dex and oxygen is close to abundances in dwarfs .",
    "the stellar positions in the @xmath0 versus stellar mass diagram as well as comparisons to stellar evolutionary sequences in the luminosity versus effective temperature diagram by girardi et al .

    "the stars investigated fall to these groups in approximately equal numbers .    and",
    "finally , we would like to point out that thermohaline convection is a fundamental physical process and is important in evolution of red giants . however , most probably thermohaline mixing is not the only physical process responsible for surface abundance anomalies in red giants ( c.f . cantiello & langer 2010 ) .",

    "<S> the _ hipparcos _ orbiting observatory has revealed a large number of helium - core- burning `` clump '' stars in the galactic field . these low - mass stars exhibit signatures of extra - mixing processes that require modeling beyond the first dredge - up of standard models . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 ratio is the most robust diagnostic of deep mixing , because it is insensitive to the adopted stellar parameters . in this work we present @xmath0 determinations in a sample of 34 galactic clump stars as well as abundances of nitrogen , carbon and oxygen . </S>",
    "<S> abundances of carbon were studied using the @xmath1 swan ( 0,1 ) band head at 5635.5   . </S>",
    "<S> the wavelength interval 79808130   with strong cn features was analysed in order to determine nitrogen abundances and @xmath0 isotope ratios . </S>",
    "<S> the oxygen abundances were determined from the [ oi ] line at 6300   . compared with </S>",
    "<S> the sun and dwarf stars of the galactic disk , mean abundances in the investigated clump stars suggest that carbon is depleted by about 0.2  dex , nitrogen is enhanced by 0.2  dex and oxygen is close to abundances in dwarfs . comparisons to evolutionary models </S>",
    "<S> show that the stars fall into two groups : the one is of first ascent giants with carbon isotope ratios altered according to the first dredge - up prediction , and the other one is of helium - core - burning stars with carbon isotope ratios altered by extra mixing . </S>",
    "<S> the stars investigated fall to these groups in approximately equal numbers .    </S>",
