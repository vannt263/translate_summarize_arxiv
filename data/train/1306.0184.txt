    "any isolated population ultimately goes extinct with probability one .",
    "this happens , even in the absence of detrimental environmental variations , because of the shot noise of elementary processes of reproduction and death .",
    "the noise ( also called demographic stochasticity ) ultimately brings the population to an absorbing state at zero population size @xcite . in",
    "sufficiently large , and therefore long - lived populations , extinction is caused by a rare chain of events when population losses dominate over gains . in this case the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of population size exhibits a long - lived metastable , or quasi - stationary state , and the probability is slowly  leaking \" into the absorbing state , see ref . @xcite and references therein .",
    "a mathematically similar setting appears in many other contexts in physics , chemistry , biology and other fields .",
    "one important example is extinction of a disease from a population following an endemic , under condition that no new infectives arrive @xcite .",
    "it has long been recognized that immigrants from surrounding populations can prevent local extinction of a small population by either recolonization of empty regions or the  rescue effect \" @xcite .",
    "similarly , introduction of new infected individuals into a population , which has recovered from an infection , can reignite the epidemics .",
    "mathematically , by introducing a steady immigration flux , with no matter how small a rate , one eliminates the absorbing state at zero population size and therefore prevents extinction . at too a low immigration rate , however , this prevention is only nominal . indeed ,",
    "if the immigration rate is much lower than the characteristic extinction rate of the isolated population , the observed population size will most likely be zero for any chosen moment of time . how significant should the immigration rate be so that the probability of observing a local population extinct is considerably reduced ?",
    "this question was already posed by macarthur and wilson @xcite who discussed how the equilibrium number of species ( the sum of species - specific occupancies ) , found on an island , depends on the balance of colonization and extinction rates .",
    "more recently , matis and kiffe @xcite considered a nonlinear stochastic population model with immigration and suggested a cumulant truncation procedure to approximate the pdf of the population size in this model .",
    "we will deal with a similar model here , but solve it exactly .",
    "furthermore , we use the exact solution to address two additional questions that have not been addressed before .",
    "the first question is the following : is there any connection between ( i ) the truly stationary pdf of the population size in the case with immigration and ( ii ) the quasi - stationary pdf of the population size without immigration ? the second question is : under what conditions can one justify the simple _ patch occupancy models _",
    "@xcite which ignore the population distribution and its dynamics in a patch , and treat a patch simply as either occupied or empty ?    the model we will be dealing with is obtained by adding a steady immigration process to a variant of the verhulst model : a prototypical model of isolated stochastic population . in sec .",
    "2 we will first outline the verhulst model without immigration , and then add immigration process . in sec .",
    "iii we derive the exact solution for the pdf of the population size .",
    "iv presents the results of asymptotic analysis of the exact solution in the regime of low immigration rate and large mean population size . in sec .",
    "v we discuss the connection between our verhulst model with immigration and a simple two - state stochastic patch occupancy model . in sec .",
    "vi we extend some of our finding to more complicated situations .",
    "the main results are briefly summarized in sec .",
    "we assume a well - mixed single population where individuals undergo reproduction and death . in the absence of immigration ,",
    "the model coincides with a variant of verhulst model @xcite . the reproduction and mortality rates",
    "are given by @xmath0 respectively , and time and the rates are rescaled by the linear in @xmath1 term in the mortality rate .",
    "we will assume throughout most of this paper that the reproduction rate of the population is greater than one : @xmath2 .",
    "in this case the deterministic rate equation , @xmath3 has an attracting fixed point , @xmath4 .",
    "this fixed point describes an established population which , according to the deterministic theory , persists forever . in the stochastic model",
    "the shot noise drives the population to extinction .",
    "correspondingly , the stationary pdf of the population size is equal to the kronecker s delta @xmath5 , so the probability to find the system empty at @xmath6 is equal to 1 . for @xmath7 , the mean time to extinction is exponentially long in @xmath8 : @xmath9 see refs .",
    "the quasi - stationary pdf of the population size can be calculated from the general formulas of ref .",

    "in metapopulation theory , much of work has been based on stochastic patch occupancy models @xcite which ignore the local population distribution and its dynamics in a patch and treat a patch simply as either occupied or empty .",
    "the simplest stochastic patch occupancy model appears in the context of mainland - island model @xcite , where the mainland effectively serves as a stationary reservoir of immigrants .",
    "as we will now show , in the regime where the population is long - lived and the immigration rate is low , the results obtained with a patch occupancy model agree with the results we have obtained from the verhulst model with immigration .    consider a single patch ( island ) that can be either occupied , with probability @xmath75 , or empty with probability @xmath80 , so that @xmath81 . assuming that both immigration events into the patch and extinction events of the patch population are rare , and therefore independent and poisson - distributed , we set the transition rate from the empty state to the occupied state as @xmath82 , and the transition rate of the reverse process as @xmath83 .",
    "the dynamics of this simple two - state system is described by the equations @xmath84 in the steady state one obtains @xmath85 now let us relate the rates @xmath86 and @xmath83 with the detailed model we dealt with in the previous sections .",
    "the transition rate @xmath83 from the occupied state to the empty state is equal to @xmath87 : the extinction rate of the population without immigration .",

    "this is because the immigration rate @xmath14 of the detailed model is merely an _ attempt _ rate of occupying the site , while the rate @xmath86 characterizes _ successful _ attempts . to find @xmath86",
    "we should go back to our detailed model where , at low population sizes , we can neglect the nonlinear term in the mortality rate ( [ verhulst ] ) .",

    "( [ steadysimple ] ) coincide with the predictions from eqs .",
    "( [ finalp0 ] ) and ( [ nonempty ] ) , respectively .",
    "the simple patch - occupancy equations ( [ set ] ) also predict the characteristic relaxation time of the system toward the stationary state ( [ steadysimple ] ) : @xmath105 note that in this regime the relaxation time is quite long .",

    "we expect that eq .",
    "( [ reltime ] ) also holds , for large @xmath8 and small @xmath14 , for the detailed model ( [ master ] ) , where it gives the relaxation time toward the stationary pdf described by eqs .",
    "( [ finalp0 ] ) and ( [ pnappr ] ) [ or ( [ pnappra ] ) ] .",
    "the connection to the patch occupancy model provides a simple , albeit non - rigorous , tool for extending some of our results to more complex situations that those accounted for by the simple verhulst model .",
    "( we should remember , however , to demand a sufficiently low immigration rate , and that the population without immigration is long - lived . )",
    "one immediate extension is to allow the immigrants to arrive in groups .",
    "let @xmath109 be the probability that the arriving group includes @xmath1 individuals , @xmath110 .",
    "then the probability that an arriving group leads to successful establishment is @xmath111 , where @xmath112 , see the paragraph after eq .",

    "for example , let the group size be poisson distributed with mean @xmath113 , @xmath114 , and let the arrival rate of groups be @xmath115 @xcite so that the per - capita arrival rate is @xmath14 as before .",
    "it is easy to see that the rate of successful establishment in this case is @xmath116}{\\nu},\\ ] ] with corresponding results for the steady state values @xmath117 one can see from here that arrival in groups is less beneficial for the population : the probability of the patch being occupied is maximized when @xmath113 goes to zero .",
    "a more important extension is to account for the allee effect , by which population biologists call a group of effects leading to a reduction in the per - capita growth rate at small population sizes @xcite .",
    "when the allee effect is present , a non - zero critical population size for establishment appears already in deterministic theory .",
    "if the initial population size is smaller than the critical size , the population goes extinct quickly , whereas if the initial population size is greater than the critical size , a long - lived population appears .",
    "a simple way to account for the allee effect is to modify the reproduction rate @xmath118 in eq .",
    "( [ verhulst ] ) , so that @xmath119 where the magnitude of the allee effect is governed by the parameter @xmath120 . at low immigration rates , and when the population can be long - lived without immigration , the allee effect changes the quantities @xmath83 and @xmath86 entering eq .",

    "we should solve the recursion equation ( [ recursive ] ) , where we can neglect the density dependence in the mortality rate @xmath127 but must keep it in the reproduction rate @xmath118 from eq .",

    "we obtain a simple formula @xmath131 ( which , in its turn , coincides with our previous result @xmath132 for @xmath133 : when the allee effect is absent )",
    ". therefore , the establishment probability for the single immigrant is @xmath134 , and the rate of establishment is @xmath135 . finally , we use eq .",
    "( [ steadysimple ] ) to predict the stationary probability of observing the population extinct : @xmath136 with @xmath122 from eq .",
    "( [ mte1 ] ) .",
    "as expected , a strong allee effect , @xmath137 , greatly decreases the establishment probability for the single immigrant and increases @xmath15 .",
    "we determined the stationary pdf of the population size in a variant of the verhulst model : a simple stochastic population model with independent births , density - dependent deaths and steady immigration .",
    "we solved this problem exactly , and found the minimal immigration rate @xmath14 needed for bringing the probability of observing the population extinct below some fixed level , for example @xmath48 . in the limit of low immigration this probability ,",
    "( [ finalp0 ] ) , is determined by the ratio of the rate of successful immigration , @xmath138 , and the extinction rate in the same system but without immigration .",
    "we have also established , in this limit , a simple relation between the pdf of the population size in the steady state with immigration and the long - lived quasi - stationary distribution of the population without immigration .",
    "the low - immigration asymptotics enabled us to establish connection between the detailed stochastic population model ( [ master ] ) and the simple patch occupancy model ( [ set ] ) .",
    "finally , we have exploited this connection for predicting the relaxation time ( [ reltime ] ) of the population size distribution toward its stationary state , and for extending our main results to arrivals in groups and to populations exhibiting the allee effect .",
