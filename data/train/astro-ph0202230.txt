    "an important characteristic of type 1 seyfert galaxies ( hereafter seyfert 1s ) is the highly correlated variability of the continuum flux across a wide range of optical and ultraviolet wavelengths .",
    "the short relative lags between the various bands and the observed optical / uv color variations have been interpreted as evidence of thermal reprocessing by the accretion disk of higher energy emission from a single , relatively compact source ( krolik et al .",
    "1991 ; courvoisier & clavel 1991 ; collin - souffrin 1991 ) .",
    "the principal candidate for this emission is the power - law - like x - ray continuum which is believed to be produced via thermal comptonization in regions of hot plasma near the central black hole .",
    "observations of relativistically broadened iron k@xmath2 emission lines and the so - called compton reflection hump provide further evidence that a substantial amount of x - ray flux is intercepted and reprocessed by a thin accretion disk in these systems .",
    "recent multiwaveband monitoring observations of seyfert 1s have shown that the optical / uv emission is not related to the observed x - ray flux in any simple way . in june ",
    "july 1996 , a @xmath3 day uv and x - ray monitoring campaign of ngc 7469 by the _ international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) _ and the _ rossi x - ray timing experiment ( rxte ) _ showed that although the uv and 210 kev x - ray light curves displayed some rough similarities in variability amplitudes and time scales , they were not related in a fashion that would naively be expected from thermal reprocessing ( nandra et al .",
    "in particular , the uv maxima preceded similar features in the x - rays by @xmath4 days , while the minima in both light curves occurred nearly simultaneously .",
    "a more recent analysis of these data revealed , however , that the uv light curve is well correlated with the x - ray spectral index as well as with the extrapolated x - ray flux in the 0.1100kev band .",
    "this suggests that there is a causal connection between the x - ray and uv emission in this object ( nandra et al .",
    "2000 ) . in april 1998 , an intensive 3-day optical / uv / x - ray monitoring observation of ngc 3516 by the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ and _ rxte _ showed optical fluxes which changed only by @xmath5% ( peak - to - peak ) while the 210kev x - ray flux varied by @xmath6%",
    "furthermore , the shapes of the variations in the optical and x - ray light curves were only marginally similar . nonetheless , the variability at optical wavelengths , from 3590  to 5510 , was highly correlated with essentially zero lag between the different continuum bands , consistent with the thermal reprocessing model ( edelson et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "chiang & blaes ( 2001a ; hereafter paper i ) have shown that the 1998 optical and x - ray observations of ngc 3516 can largely be explained by a thermal comptonization / disk reprocessing model similar to that proposed by poutanen , krolik , & ryde ( 1997 ) to account for the differences between the hard and soft spectral states in the galactic x - ray binary cygnus x-1 .",
    "this model was also applied in a simplified form by zdziarski , lubiski , & smith ( 1999 ; hereafter zls ) to both x - ray binaries and seyfert galaxies in order to explain an apparent correlation between the x - ray spectral index and the relative magnitude of the compton reflection component . in paper",
    "i , we found that inversely - related changes in the size and x - ray luminosity of the comptonizing plasma can produce the relatively large variations in the 210  kev band while causing only much smaller variations in the disk thermal reprocessed emission . with the addition of disk emission due to internal viscous dissipation",
    ", we found that the optical and x - ray variations could be roughly matched while simultaneously satisfying an energy balance condition relating the bolometric luminosity to the radiative power available through disk accretion .    in this paper , we refine the calculations for ngc 3516 presented in paper i by explicitly fitting the optical and x - ray continuum data and producing broad band spectral energy distributions ( seds ) for each observing epoch .",
    "in addition , we apply these calculations to the 1996 uv / x - ray monitoring observations of ngc 7469 in order to provide a more complete physical picture for the correlations found by nandra et al .",
    "we proceed by discussing the relevant optical , uv , and x - ray observations in  2 . in  3 , we describe the thermal comptonization and disk reprocessing model including our modifications of the geometry of the comptonizing region and empirical color corrections for the disk emission .",
    "the results for ngc 3516 and ngc 7469 are presented in  4 ; and we discuss these results and conclude in  5 .",

    "the flux measurements at 1360  made by edelson et al .  were not simultaneous with the optical data , and as these authors discuss , the uv measurements are affected by detector gain changes induced by thermal variations .",
    "therefore , we restrict our analysis of the disk thermal emission to the optical bands .",

    "the geometry we consider is similar to that proposed by shapiro , lightman , & eardley ( 1976 ) in their two - temperature disk model of cygnus x-1 : a central , geometrically thick region of hot plasma surrounded by a relatively cold , thin accretion disk . in principle , the hot central region could arise because of a thermal instability as originally envisioned by shapiro et al .",

    "( 1997 ) , our goal is to infer the properties of the disk and comptonizing plasma from the radiation physics and thereby provide constraints for the dynamical models of the inner accretion flow which may help distinguish between the various candidates .",
    "a key feature of the present calculations is the thermostatic feedback effect between the x - ray emission from the comptonizing plasma and the soft photons which are produced by thermal reprocessing of these x - rays by the accretion disk ( haardt & maraschi 1991 ; stern et al.1995 ) .",
    "zls noted that the degree of feedback can be adjusted by altering the geometry of the hot plasma , and they invoked this mechanism to explain the apparent correlation between the x - ray spectral index , @xmath23 , and the relative magnitude , @xmath24 , of the compton reflection component in seyfert galaxies and x - ray binaries .",

    "1997 and similar results zdziarski et al.(1998 ) obtained by applying a similar analysis to the x - ray binary gx339@xmath94 , zls proposed that the region of comptonizing plasma takes the form of a uniform , optically thin sphere centered on the black hole .",
    "the x - ray spectral index variations occur because the disk penetrates the plasma sphere by different amounts due to changes in the sphere radius , @xmath25 , and/or changes in the disk inner truncation radius , @xmath26 .",
    "greater overlap of the disk by the sphere results in a larger fraction of the x - ray emission being intercepted by the disk and also in a larger amount of reprocessed flux .",

    "i , we showed that the near constant optical continuum of ngc 3516 in the presence of large variations in the x - ray flux could be explained in this model if the thermal comptonization luminosity were inversely proportional to the radius of the plasma sphere , @xmath44 .",
    "in addition , we found that the disk inner truncation radius had to be fairly constant on time scales longer than the 3-day observation in order to avoid excessive color variations in the optical and uv bands .",
    "however , if one assumes that the contribution to the disk thermal emission from internal viscous dissipation is negligible , then the amount of x - ray luminosity required to produce the observed optical continuum levels result in 210kev fluxes which exceed the observed values by a factor @xmath45 .",
    "the addition of viscous dissipation in the disk can reduce the needed x - ray luminosity substantially ; and as it turns out , the amount of viscous dissipation required to reproduce the mean x - ray spectrum also satisfies an energy balance condition : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the luminosity of the disk thermal emission due to viscous dissipation assuming that the inner disk is cut - off at the truncation radius @xmath26 , and @xmath48 is the total luminosity from viscous dissipation for an untruncated thin disk extending all the way down to @xmath42 : @xmath49 the difference @xmath50 can be interpreted as the accretion power that would otherwise emerge as local blackbody emission from the inner regions of the disk that is instead being used to heat the comptonizing plasma .",

    "the corresponding fits for ngc 7469 shown in fig .",
    "[ 7469_lcs ] ( solid diamonds ) present a different picture for the inner regions of this object and seem to require additional elements in the model .",
    "first of all , the generally softer x - ray spectra imply values of @xmath25 which are close to the disk inner radius so that the central plasma region is spherical , save for one epoch when the x - ray spectrum is its hardest .",
    "of course , the specific values we fit for @xmath25 also depend on our choice of @xmath41 .",
    "second , the variations in the observed optical fluxes are noticeably smaller than that of the model .",
    "part of the excess variability in the model optical light curves is due to the fact that light travel time effects are not included in these calculations .",
    "the measured time lags of @xmath136 day imply that the model curves should be smeared out on at least this time scale .",
    "however , even if such light travel time effects are included , there will still be excess variability at the @xmath137 day time scale .",
    "nonetheless , given the simplicity of this model , it is encouraging that the shape and magnitude of the uv light curve can be so well reproduced while the relative magnitude of the optical fluxes are approximately matched and the optical variability is not greatly over - predicted .",
    "unfortunately , the relatively large variations in the uv flux seem to require much larger changes in the x - ray luminosity than are found by simply extrapolating the 210 kev flux over even as broad a range as 0.1 to 100 kev ( see nandra et al .",
    "2000 ) . given the measured 210  kev fluxes and photon indices , the size of the @xmath31 variations which are required by thermal reprocessing can only be accommodated by setting the thermal roll - over energy to unrealistically large values  in several epochs , we find @xmath138  kev .",
    "clearly , such large temperatures are not consistent with the underlying assumptions of these calculations .",
    "not only would pair - production and non - thermal emission likely be present at these temperatures ( coppi 1999 ) , the shape of the thermal comptonization continuum at 210 kev would not resemble a power - law as individual scattering orders would become apparent in these spectra for temperatures @xmath139  kev ( e.g. , stern et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "one way of narrowing the required temperature range is by giving the observed x - ray continuum more `` leverage '' in producing a greater amount of variability in the thermal reprocessed disk emission .",
    "this can be accomplished by allowing for anisotropy in the thermal compton emission so that the x - ray intensity that we see directly is less than the x - ray intensity incident upon the accretion disk .",
    "such anisotropy may arise in several different ways .",
    "the strong gravitational field of the central black hole will cause radiation produced near it to follow curved geodesics which may intercept the disk rather than follow straight - line trajectories to infinity ( e.g. , cunningham 1975 ) .",
    "bulk relativistic motion of the comptonizing plasma will beam the radiation along the direction of motion ( beloborodov 1999 ) .",
    "however , in this case , the bulk motion would have to be directed towards the disk instead of away from it as would occur in a mildly relativistic jet .",
    "finally , since the region of comptonizing plasma is not being illuminated uniformly , but rather by the seed photons from the disk encircling its equator , there is a strong preference for the thermal compton photons of the first scattering order to be directed back towards the disk .    ideally , we would have full descriptions of the geodesics followed by the thermal compton radiation in order to account for the aforementioned effects properly , but the use of a simple parameterization will serve to illustrate how large a difference some mild anisotropy can make .",
    "therefore , rather than modeling the various effects in detail , we instead introduce a parameter , @xmath140 , which describes the anisotropy so that the total luminosity of the comptonizing plasma and the luminosity used to compute the thermal reprocessed emission is given by @xmath141 here @xmath142 is the apparent luminosity inferred from the assumed thermal roll - over , @xmath83 , the measured spectral index , and the measured 210  kev flux , i.e. , it is the @xmath31 given by eqs .",

    ", we have recomputed the spectral fits to the ngc 7469 data and plotted the results in fig .",
    "[ 7469_lcs ] ( plus - signs ) .",
    "as expected , a narrower range of plasma temperatures are found which reproduce the optical / uv variability , but the plasma temperatures nonetheless reach values @xmath144  kev , which are still too large to be self - consistent .",
    "we now ease some of the restrictions on the parameters of the x - ray spectrum .",
    "for all previous fits , we have used the best - fit values of the photon indices obtained from the x - ray spectral fitting . since many of the spectral indices for the ngc 7469 observations are near @xmath145 ( see fig .",
    "[ 7469_lcs_fudge ] ) , a given change in the thermal roll - over energy @xmath122 has less impact on the overall x - ray luminosity than it would for a harder spectrum with , say , @xmath146 .",
    "therefore , in order to increase the accessible range of the x - ray luminosities , we allow the x - ray spectral index to vary within the 1-sigma bounds of the best - fit values , and we allow for small variations in the 210 kev flux used to compute @xmath31 ( eq .  [ f210 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we restrict the plasma temperature to be @xmath147  kev @xmath148  kev ; and we set the anisotropy parameter to be @xmath143 , as before . with these additional conditions , we obtain the spectral fits shown in fig .",
    "[ 7469_lcs_fudge ] . for some epochs",
    ", the x - ray spectral indices attain values which are right at the 1-sigma limits , and small deviations from the observed x - ray fluxes and somewhat larger deviations in uv fluxes are now present , but the overall fits of the spectral energy distributions are largely satisfactory while maintaining a consistent range of plasma temperatures .",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "[ 7469_seds ] , the seds for six exemplary epochs of the ngc 7469 data for the three cases we have considered .",
    "the details of these three fitting schemes are given in table  [ 7469_parameters ] .",
    "given the parameters from the above spectral fits , ngc 3516 and ngc 7469 provide contrasting cases for the characteristics of the accretion flow in the inner regions of seyfert galaxies .",
    "ngc 3516 has a high accretion efficiency ( @xmath149% ) , a small disk inner truncation radius , and a flattened , disk - like distribution of comptonizing plasma . on the other hand , ngc 7469",
    "has a substantially lower accretion efficiency ( @xmath1503% ) , a large truncation radius , and a vertically extended hot plasma region .",
    "as we have noted above , the small truncation radius for ngc 3516 is consistent with the relativistically broadened iron k@xmath2 line measured by _",
    "asca _ over the same observing period .",
    "although similar _ asca _ observations were not taken during the 1996 campaign for ngc 7469 , nandra et al .",
    "( 2000 ) found iron k@xmath2 equivalent widths of @xmath151ev from the _ rxte / pca _ data .",

    "as we discussed in the introduction , a similar analysis was performed by poutanen et al .",
    "( 1997 ) for the x - ray binary cygnus x-1 . with respect to the semi - analytic model they used , the main difference between that work and the present is in the empirical relation employed by those authors to characterize the thermal comptonization spectrum in terms of the model parameters",

    "[ gamma(a)_old ] , by only @xmath154% for photon indices ranging from @xmath155 to 2.3 . ] on the observational side , since cygnus x-1 is significantly brighter in the hard x - rays than any seyfert galaxy , both the roll - over energy of the thermal comptonization continuum and the amplitude of the compton reflection component for cygnus x-1 could be measured directly .",
    "these data provided poutanen et al .  with estimates of the plasma temperature as well as the ratio @xmath72 .",
    "in addition , the thermal disk spectrum , which was observable in the soft x - rays , gave them constraints on the accretion disk flux and the inner disk radius .",
    "armed with this information , poutanen et al .",
    "were able to apply the scaling relation and the assumed sphere+disk geometry to determine the mass accretion rate directly in both the hard and soft spectral states rather than to have to assume values for the accretion rates based on `` reasonable '' ranges for parameters such as the plasma temperature , as we have done here .",
    "as the analysis of the cygnus x-1 data demonstrates , more stringent tests of this model in its application to seyfert galaxies will be available when the hard x - ray / soft gamma - ray spectra from these objects can be reliably measured on sufficiently short time scales to detect the changes in the spectral roll - over implied by the temperature curves in figs .",
    "[ 3516_lcs ] , [ 7469_lcs ] , and  [ 7469_lcs_fudge ] .",
    "this will require a hard x - ray telescope with a large effective area at these energies such as that proposed for _ astro - e2_. nonetheless , relevant constraints for the mean properties of the comptonizing plasma may be ascertained from existing longer time scale observations by the _ beppo - sax _ satellite and the _ oriented scintillation spectrometer experiment ( osse ) _ aboard the _ compton observatory _ and from forthcoming observations which will be available with _",
    "integral_. for example , spectral fits of data from _ osse _ observations of ngc 4151 ( johnson et al .",
    "1997 ) and from _ beppo - sax _ observations of ngc 5548 ( nicastro et al.2000 ) suggest that as the x - ray power - law spectrum softens , the cut - off energy ( or equivalently , the plasma temperature ) increases , contrary to naive expectations from thermal comptonization models .",
    "however , since the thomson depth of the plasma may also change simultaneously , a sufficiently large decrease may more than compensate for any spectral hardening which a temperature increase would otherwise imply . in fig .",
    "[ kt_vs_gamma ] , we plot the plasma temperatures versus the measured x - ray spectral indices for the `` optimal '' case fits of the ngc 7469 data ( i.e. , @xmath143 and @xmath23 allowed to vary ) and for the three cases we considered for ngc 3516 .",
    "it is clear that a strict relationship between @xmath156 and @xmath23 is not required .",
    "since changes in @xmath125 will affect both @xmath31 and the thermal reprocessing contribution to the disk emission , simultaneous optical and uv monitoring will be necessary in order for longer term measurements of the hard x - ray spectra of seyfert 1s to constrain thermal comptonization models in which thermal reprocessing plays an important role .",
    "greater spectral coverage in the hard x - ray band will also provide improved constraints on the apparent correlation between the thermal comptonization spectral index and the relative strength of the compton reflection component .",
    "however , the predictions of the zls analysis are altered since the inclusion of disk emission due to viscous dissipation implies quite different estimates for the seed photon luminosities",
    ". the x - ray spectral indices will no longer be solely a function of the geometry , and simultaneous optical and uv monitoring along with broad band x - ray spectroscopy will again be necessary to determine the strength of the compton reflection component implied by this model .",
    "in fact , for the present data , we do find significant differences between the predicted reflection fractions and the values obtained by fitting the pexrav model to the _ rxte / pca _ data .",
    "in addition , the reflection fraction given by this model for a specific viewing angle can differ substantially from the _ average _ compton reflection strength as defined by zls .",
    "following zls , the total thermal comptonization luminosity intercepted by the disk is @xmath157 where the incident flux @xmath158 is given by eqs .  [ finc_sphere ] or  [ finc_ellipsoid ] .",

    "( 2000 ) point out , any apparent correlation between spectral index and compton reflection strength may be partially due to a statistical correlation between the parameters which arise from model fitting rather than from intrinsic properties of the source .",
    "the presence of such a statistical correlation between fitting parameters suggests that the small reflection fractions given by this model may be accommodated by the data if the underlying thermal comptonization spectra are actually somewhat harder than those found by fitting the simple reflection models to the _ rxte / pca _ data . since _ rxte _",
    "observations generally do not provide much useful spectral coverage above @xmath167kev for seyfert galaxies , more sensitive hard x - ray continuum measurements for energies @xmath168kev are required to resolve this discrepancy .    even in the absence of high quality hard x - ray data to measure the thermal roll - over or the compton reflection fraction definitively , certain aspects of this model are indeed tested by the available data , though the constraints are not as direct . for example , if the uv fluxes for ngc 7469 were consistent with an extrapolation of the @xmath169 dependence of the optical data , then a much smaller disk inner truncation radius would be required .",
    "this in turn would imply a much broader fe k@xmath2 emission line that may contradict the observations of a narrow line by guainazzi et al.(1994 ) , or it may require a much smaller black hole mass , which could be in conflict with the reverberation mapping estimates of collier et al .",

    "this accretion rate likely exceeds the critical accretion rate found by narayan & yi ( 1995 ) of @xmath175 , below which advection dominated flow is expected to occur .",
    "the anomalous viscosity parameter is found in magnetohydrodynamic simulations of disks to have values @xmath176 ( e.g. , balbus & hawley 1998 ) .",

    "we could have chosen smaller values of the accretion rates in order to satisfy the limits imposed by @xmath178 , but that would necessitate increasing the plasma temperatures in order to have larger thermal comptonization luminosities , possibly violating our implicit constraint of @xmath179 for ngc 3516 and worsening the situation for ngc 7469 . furthermore , the lower accretion rates would require much greater radiative efficiencies , and for ngc 3516 , the efficiency is already a fair fraction of unity .",
    "we could trade off reductions in the intrinsic disk luminosity with a larger anisotropy factor , but values of @xmath180 would likely be required .",

    "however , wardziski & zdziarski ( 2000 ) have argued that for seyfert 1s the disk thermal emission should be a much more important source of seed photons than thermal synchrotron emission except for very low luminosity sources which have @xmath201 .",

    "<S> using a geometry consisting of a hot central comptonizing plasma surrounded by a thin accretion disk , we model the optical through hard x - ray spectral energy distributions of the type 1 seyfert galaxies ngc 3516 and ngc 7469 . as in the model proposed by poutanen , krolik , & ryde for the x - ray binary cygnus x-1 and later applied to seyfert galaxies by zdziarski , lubiski , & smith , feedback between the radiation reprocessed by the disk and the thermal comptonization emission from the hot central plasma plays a pivotal role in determining the x - ray spectrum , and as we show , the optical and ultraviolet spectra as well . </S>",
    "<S> seemingly uncorrelated optical / uv and x - ray light curves , similar to those which have been observed from these objects can , in principle , be explained by variations in the size , shape , and temperature of the comptonizing plasma . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , by positing a disk mass accretion rate which satisfies a condition for global energy balance between the thermal comptonization luminosity and the power available from accretion , one can predict the spectral properties of the heretofore poorly measured hard x - ray continuum above @xmath0kev in type 1 seyfert galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , forthcoming measurements of the hard x - ray continuum by more sensitive hard x - ray and soft @xmath1-ray telescopes , such as those aboard the _ international gamma - ray astrophysics laboratory _ ( _ integral _ ) in conjunction with simultaneous optical , uv , and soft x - ray monitoring , will allow the mass accretion rates to be directly constrained for these sources in the context of this model . </S>"
