    "the method of high-@xmath0 two - particle azimuthal correlations is a unique probe of the hot , dense medium created in heavy - ion collisions at rhic .",
    "early rhic results on hadron - hadron correlations indicate a strong modification of the away - side jet shape and yield by the medium  @xcite .",
    "these modifications provide valuable constraints on the properties of the hot , dense medium . however ,",
    "the physics interpretations of the away - side modification are complicated as the trigger hadrons mostly come from the surface of the medium . direct photons , due to their weak coupling with the medium , provide a cleaner calibration of the energy and direction of the away - side jets .",
    "thus , direct photon - hadron correlations can provide less biased and quantitative measurements of the away - side modifications .    at rhic energies , identification of direct photons",
    "is difficult due to the large number of background photons from hadronic decays , mostly from @xmath5 decays .",
    "therefore the extraction of the direct photon - hadron per - trigger yields relies on a statistical subtraction of the decay photon - hadron per - trigger yields from the inclusive photon - hadron per - trigger yields .    a two - particle correlation function ( @xmath6 ) as measured in the phenix central spectrometer arms is constructed as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the same - event pair distribution and @xmath9 is the mixed - event pair distribution .",
    "the mixed - event distribution is used to correct for the non - uniform phenix pair acceptance .",
    "the correlation function ( cf ) can be decomposed into a jet function @xmath10 and a underlying flow modulated background term . after subtracting the background , we correct the remaining @xmath10 by the single particle efficiency and the phenix acceptance , then normalize it by the number of triggers , thus obtaining the per - trigger yield  @xcite .",
    "the per - trigger yield distributions are fitted with a double gaussian function to extract the gaussian width for both peaks ( @xmath11 for near - side / away - side ) .",
    "the jet yield is integrated over a @xmath12 region of @xmath13 around each peak .",

    "is a comparison to the nuclear modification factor @xmath20 of high-@xmath0 @xmath5s , the observed @xmath19 is similar to the nuclear modification factor .",
    "while dijet measurements suffer from trigger bias and possible trigger surface bias , an ideal probe for studying the jet modification in medium is the use of direct photon - hadron correlations  @xcite .",
    "this measurement is aided by the fact that phenix has observed a factor of @xmath242 excess of photons above the hadronic decay background at @xmath25 in the most central @xmath4 collisions , which is consistent with direct photon production as calculated by pqcd  @xcite .",
    "we employ a statistical subtraction method to extract direct photon - hadron correlations and per - trigger yields .",
    "first , the inclusive photon - hadron per - trigger yields ( @xmath26 ) are constructed by subtracting the background term ( using the measured inclusive photon @xmath27 ) from the inclusive photon - hadron cf .",
    "then , starting from @xmath5-hadron pairs , we construct the decay photon - hadron cf .",
    "this is done by performing a pair by pair weighted sum to convolute the contributions from feeddown from @xmath5 decays .",
    "the weights applied are derived from the @xmath5 decay kinematics . from the decay photon - hadron cf",
