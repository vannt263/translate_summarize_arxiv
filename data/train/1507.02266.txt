    "we consider several fundamental multi - user network structures under secrecy constraints : gaussian wiretap channel with @xmath0 helpers , @xmath1-user gaussian multiple access wiretap channel and @xmath1-user gaussian interference channel with secrecy constraints .",
    "security of communication was first considered by shannon in @xcite , where a legitimate pair wishes to have secure communication in the presence of an eavesdropper over a noiseless channel , leading to the necessity of secure keys and the one - time - pad encryption method , in that model .",
    "wyner introduced the noisy wiretap channel , and demonstrated that secure communication can be attained by stochastic encoding without using any keys , if the eavesdropper is degraded with respect to the legitimate receiver @xcite .",
    "csiszar and korner generalized his result to arbitrary , not necessarily degraded , wiretap channels , and showed that secure communication is still possible , even when the eavesdropper is not degraded @xcite .",
    "csiszar and korner introduced channel prefixing and rate splitting into the achievable scheme in addition to wyner s stochastic encoding .",

    "is that the cooperation signals should not have too much randomness ( hence the sub - optimality of i.i.d .",
    "gaussian signalling ) , as they hurt both the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper .",
    "therefore , _ weaker _ cooperative jamming signals are needed , and that the received sub - spaces at the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper need to be carefully controlled .",

    "each one of @xmath0 helpers sends a cooperative jamming signal .",
    "all signals , both message carrying and cooperative jamming signals , come from structured pulse amplitude modulation ( pam ) constellations .",
    "each one of the cooperative jamming signals is aligned with a message carrying signal at the eavesdropper ; see fig .  [",

    "this action protects the message by limiting the information leakage to the eavesdropper .",
    "this is akin to _ one - time - pad _ in wired systems @xcite . in one - time - pad ,",

    "the details of the performance analysis in terms of rate and equivocation achieved by this scheme is based on the khintchine - groshev theorem of diophantine approximation in number theory .",
    "the converse developed in @xcite for this channel model has two key steps .",
    "first , the secrecy rate is upper bounded by the difference of the sum of differential entropies of the channel inputs of the legitimate receiver and the helpers and the differential entropy of the eavesdropper s observation . due to the eavesdropper s observation ,",
    "one of the independent channel inputs is eliminated , and that is why this fact is named the _ secrecy penalty _ lemma . in the second step , a direct relationship is developed between the cooperative jamming signal from an independent helper and the message rate .",
    "the motivation of this step , which is named , _ role of a helper _ lemma , is to determine the optimum action ( role ) of a helper : if the legitimate user is to reliably decode the message signal which is mixed with the cooperative jamming signal , there must exist a constraint on the cooperative jamming signal .",
    "this lemma identifies this constraint by developing an upper bound on the differential entropy of the cooperative jamming signal coming from a helper in terms of the message rate . by using these two lemmas , and the achievable scheme described above , @xcite determine the exact s.d.o.f .  of the gaussian wiretap channel with @xmath0 helpers to be @xmath5 .",

    "the converse in this case is by extending the _ secrecy penalty _ and _ role of a helper _ lemmas to a multi - message setting .",
    "the achievability is by real interference alignment , channel prefixing by cooperative jamming , and structured signalling .",
    "specifically , each transmitter divides its message into @xmath7 sub - messages , and sends these messages together with a cooperative jamming signal ; see fig  [ fig : mac_k_ia ] .",
    "all of the signals come from the same structured pam constellation .",
    "each cooperative jamming signal is aligned with @xmath7 message carrying signals at the eavesdropper , protecting all of them simultaneously . at the same time , all of the @xmath1 cooperative jamming signals are aligned in the smallest sub - space at the legitimate receiver .",

    "the major effort in @xcite is to efficiently enumerate all of the extreme points of the converse region , and then to develop an achievable scheme for each extreme point of this region ; the achievability of the entire region then follows from time - sharing .",
    "a crucial property of all of the scenarios considered so far is that the transmitters have full channel state information ( csi ) of all channels in the system .",
    "in fact , these csi are carefully utilized in the corresponding alignment schemes .",

    "<S> we revisit the recent secure degrees of freedom ( s.d.o.f . ) results for one - hop multi - user wireless networks by considering three fundamental wireless network structures : gaussian wiretap channel with helpers , gaussian multiple access wiretap channel , and gaussian interference channel with secrecy constraints . </S>",
    "<S> we present main enabling tools and resulting communication schemes in an expository manner , along with key insights and design principles emerging from them . </S>",
    "<S> the main achievable schemes are based on real interference alignment , channel prefixing via cooperative jamming , and structured signalling . </S>",
    "<S> real interference alignment enables aligning the cooperative jamming signals together with the message carrying signals at the eavesdroppers to protect them akin to one - time - pad protecting messages in wired systems . </S>",
    "<S> real interference alignment also enables decodability at the legitimate receivers by rendering message carrying and cooperative jamming signals separable , and simultaneously aligning the cooperative jamming signals in the smallest possible sub - space . </S>",
    "<S> the main converse techniques are based on two key lemmas which quantify the _ secrecy penalty _ by showing that the net effect of an eavesdropper on the system is that it eliminates one of the independent channel inputs ; and the _ role of a helper _ by developing a direct relationship between the cooperative jamming signal of a helper and the message rate . </S>",
    "<S> these two lemmas when applied according to the unique structure of individual networks provide tight converses . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we present a blind cooperative jamming scheme for the helper network with no eavesdropper channel state information at the transmitters that achieves the same optimal s.d.o.f .  as in the case of full eavesdropper channel state information .    </S>",
