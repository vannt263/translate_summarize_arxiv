    "the initial kinetic energy of colliding bodies is distributed into the internal degrees of freedom in an inelastic collision .",
    "such a collision is characterized by the restitution coefficient @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are , respectively , the relative colliding speed and the relative rebound speed .",
    "although it is believed that the restitution coefficient @xmath3 satisfies @xmath4 for impacts of macroscopic bodies , the anomalous impact with @xmath5 is possible in some special situations for small bodies .",
    "indeed , the prohibition of @xmath5 is originated from the second law of thermodynamics@xcite , but some terms which disappear in the thermodynamic limit play important roles in the description of small systems .",
    "it should be noted that the restitution coefficient projected into the normal direction of the collision can easily exceed unity in the case of oblique collisions.@xcite    the low - speed collisions for macroscopic bodies are believed to be described by the quasi - static theory , which is consistent with some experimental results.@xcite however , it is not obvious whether the quasi - static theory is applicable to the impact of nanoclusters .",
    "indeed , we expect that the effects of cohesive force among atoms can not be ignored for such small systems .",
    "et al._@xcite reported that the dependence of the restitution coefficient @xmath3 on the impact speed for nanoclusters , which contain adhesions , differs from the prediction from the quasi - static theory based on their molecular dynamics simulation ( mds ) .",
    "in a recent paper , brilliantov _ et al . _ extend the quasi - static theory to the theory of cohesive collisions.@xcite the physics of nanoclusters is one of hot subjects . the mds is a standard tool to investigate collisions of nanoclusters such as fulleren .",

    "the other studies discuss the collisions of a cluster with a substrate@xcite , the erosion process on a diamond surface@xcite , and the fragmentation pattern of clusters@xcite .",
    "so far , we do not know any paper to investigate the effects of thermal fluctuations on collisions of nanoclusters except for our preliminary report.@xcite    in this paper , we perform the mds of colliding clusters to investigate the effect of thermal fluctuations . this is the extension of our previous work.@xcite in the first part , we review what model is adequate to describe the collision of nanoclusters . in the next section",
    ", we introduce the generalized langevin equation and the fluctuation - dissipation relation in the first kind . in section 3",
    ", we calculate the velocity autocorrelation function ( vacf ) of a lattice model to apply it to a system of a nanocluster .",
    "then , we justify the quasi - static theory to describe the collisions of nanoclusters . in the second part ,",
    "we show the detailed results of our numerical simulations . in section 4 , we introduce our numerical model of the mds . in section 5",
    ", we explain the results of our simulation , which consist of four subsections . in the first subsection",
    ", we check the relaxation of vacf in our model . in the next subsection ,",

    ", we compare our numerical result of the impact speed dependence of the restitution coefficient with the quasi - static theory of cohesive or noncohesive collisions . in section 5.4",
    ", we show the frequency distribution functions of the restitution coefficient and their dependence on cohesive force between atoms .",
    "we also show the probabilities to appear four categories in our simulation when the cohesive parameter is finite . in section 6 ,",
    "we discuss and summarize our results .",
    "it is well known that we can formally rewrite the newtonian equation of motion as the generalized langevin equation for the ` slow ' variable . when we consider the motion of colliding a pair of small clusters , it is natural to adopt the relative velocity @xmath6 between the center of mass of each cluster as the slow variable@xcite .",
    "we should note that the center of mass is characterized by the total mass of one cluster , while each element of the cluster can be characterized by the mass for the element .",
    "thus , the effective mass of the center of mass is much larger than the mass of the element .",
    "thus , the generalized langevin equation is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 are the memory kernel , the fluctuating force from the fast oscillations , the reduced mass of two clusters , and the systematic force acting on the centers of mass , respectively .",
    "the fluctuation force @xmath9 is believed to be unimportant for the impact problem of two clusters .",
    "the systematic force @xmath11 may be approximated by the hertzian contact force . from the fluctuation - dissipation relation in the first kind ,",
    "the laplace transform @xmath12 satisfies @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the temperature , and the boltzmann constant is set to be unity@xcite .",
    "we should note that @xmath15 can be defined as the usual fourier transform if we assume @xmath16 for @xmath17 .",
    "if the integration of the velocity autocorrelation function ( vacf ) , _ i.e. _ @xmath18 is finite , @xmath19 is finite . in this case , the generalized langevin equation can be approximated by the langevin equation with the white noise satisfying @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the @xmath22-th component of @xmath9 .",
    "it is obvious that this langevin equation is an irreversible equation .",
    "thus , the behavior of vacf is the most important to characterize the macroscopic dissipation .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , the relaxation of vacf plays a key role for the equilibration process of a system .",
    "let us consider the relaxation of vacf in a nanocluster which consists of a regular lattice with equal - mass atoms . when the atoms are confined in attractive potential , the excitation from the ground state is characterized by the harmonic oscillation in a simple cubic lattice . in this section ,",
    "we demonstrate that vacf of a uniform system in the simple cubic lattice exhibits the slow relaxation proportional to @xmath23 .",
    "the analysis presented here is the straightforward extension of the one - dimensional cases.@xcite    let us consider an infinitely large simple cubic lattice system in which the mass points with mass @xmath24 connecting with the linear spring whose spring constant is @xmath25 .",
    "the position of each lattice point can be specified by a set of integer @xmath26 in this system . introducing the characteristic angular frequency @xmath27 , the equation of motion of the deviation from the equilibrium position @xmath28 obeys @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "let us introduce the lattice fourier transform and the inverse fourier transform as @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",

    "we reach @xmath43 where we have used @xmath44 .    here ,",
    "vacf at the center of the mass is defined by @xmath45 where @xmath46 represents the ensemble average over the different initial conditions .",

    "this result is essentially the same as that for one - dimensional case @xmath64 .",
    "this time dependence of vacf can be observed in the direct simulation of nanoclusters in which each cluster is a 13 layer of the spherical cut of face - centered cubic ( fcc ) lattice , _ i.e. _ 682 lennard - jones atoms ( fig.3 ) .",
    "the setup of our simulation will be explained in the latter part .    , where the time is dimensionless time for the mds . , scaledwidth=80.0% ]    , where the time is dimensionless time for the mds .",
    ", scaledwidth=80.0% ]    in spite of this extremely slow relaxation under the absence of @xmath65 , we can approximately define the friction constant in the langevin equation to describe the low frequency behaviors .",
    "actually , if we adopt the approximation @xmath66 with a constant @xmath67 for large @xmath68 , substituting this into ( [ fdr ] ) we obtain @xmath69 for @xmath70 .",
    "thus , we may approximate @xmath71 by @xmath72 where @xmath73 is dirac s delta function and @xmath74 .",
    "thus , the memory term can be approximated by @xmath75 where the last term can be absorbed in the initial condition .",
    "finally , we obtain the effective langevin equation for the low frequency behavior at @xmath76 as @xmath77 which does not have any essential difference from the conventional langevin equation .",
    "this may justify to use the quasi - static theory even when we consider a collision between nanoclusters of a uniform lattice system .",
    "indeed , once we accept to use the langevin equation , it is straightforward to derive the quasi - static theory of macroscopic collisions.@xcite    it should be noted that the motion of the atom at the center of mass can be described by the equation of motion for a harmonic oscillator . in order to use eq.(1 ) , we need to introduce some tricks , such as the mass difference , the contact with the other atoms and the nonlinearity",
    ". however , this argument may be instructive to understand the basis of the langevin equation from the mechanical point of view .",
    "let us introduce our numerical model .",
    "our model consists of two identical clusters .",
    "each of them is the spherical cut from a 13 layered face - centered cubic ( fcc ) lattice and consisted of @xmath78 `` atoms '' .",
    "when we simulate larger size of nanoclusters , the system is fluidized in the vicinity of surface , while the data for the smaller systems strongly depend on the specific orientation of impacts .",
    "the details of system size dependence of the simulation will be reported elsewhere .",

    "[ snap - lj - rep ] ) .",
    "all the `` atoms '' in each cluster are bounded by the lennard - jones potential @xmath79 as @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the distance between two `` atoms '' , @xmath22 and @xmath82 .",
    "the coupling coefficient of the attractive term @xmath83 is treated as a cohesive parameter between atoms on the surfaces of one cluster and those on the surface of another , while the potential act on the atoms within the same cluster satisfies @xmath84 . here",
    ", we will consider collisions for the control parameters @xmath85 and @xmath86 between different clusters.@xcite . in eq.([lj ] ) , @xmath87 is the energy constant and @xmath88 is the lattice constant .",
    "when we regard the `` atom '' as argon , the values of the constants become @xmath89 and @xmath90 , respectively .",
    "@xcite henceforth , we label the upper and the lower clusters as cluster @xmath91 and cluster @xmath92 , respectively . to reduce computational costs , we introduce the cut - off length @xmath93 of the lennard - jones interaction as @xmath94 .",
    "the procedure of our simulation is as follows .",
    "the initial velocities of the `` atoms '' in both @xmath91 and @xmath92 satisfy the maxwell - boltzmann distribution at the initial temperature @xmath14 .",
    "the initial temperature is set to be @xmath95 or @xmath96 in most of our simulations .",
    "sample average is taken over different sets of initial velocities governed by the maxwell - boltzmann velocity distribution for `` atoms '' .",
    "to equilibrate the clusters , we adopt the velocity scaling method  @xcite for @xmath97 steps in the initial stage of simulations .",
    "we have checked the equilibration of the total energy in the initial relaxation process .",
    "after the equilibration , we give translational velocities to @xmath91 and @xmath92 at the relative separation @xmath98 between two clusters to make them collide against each other , where the initial colliding speed is achieved by the acceleration @xmath99 from a stationary state .",
    "the relative speed of impact ranges from @xmath100 to @xmath101 , which are less than the thermal velocity for one `` atom '' defined by @xmath102 , where @xmath24 is the mass of the `` atom '' .",

    "in most of our simulation , we adopt the data at @xmath110 . from our impact simulation for @xmath112 at @xmath113",

    "the frequency distribution function is irregular when the cohesion exists .",
    "it is notable that the anomalous events for @xmath3 to exceed the unity becomes rare when there is the attractive interaction between clusters , though a few percent of the collisions still exhibit the anomalous impacts .",
    "this is because two clusters are coalesced with each other in the slow impacts .",
