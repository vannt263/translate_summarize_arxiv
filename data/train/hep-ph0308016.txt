    "in the nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) factorization approach , the rate of semi - inclusive quarkonium production at large transverse momentum ( @xmath1 ) is given as a sum of products of short - distance coefficients and nrqcd matrix elements @xcite .",
    "the short - distance coefficients are calculable as perturbative series in the strong - coupling constant @xmath2 , while the production matrix elements , at least so far , must be determined by comparison with experimental data .",
    "the field theoretic ingredients that form the basis for the nrqcd factorization approach for quarkonium production are the collinear factorization of hard - scattering processes at large @xmath1 @xcite and the decomposition of the factored semi - inclusive production rate into nrqcd operator matrix elements and short - distance coefficients @xcite .",
    "the nrqcd factorization formalism predicts that the nrqcd matrix elements are universal ( process independent ) , and it also leads to a set of rules @xcite for the scaling of matrix elements and interactions with @xmath3 , where @xmath3 is the heavy - quark or heavy - antiquark velocity in the quarkonium rest frame .",
    "( @xmath4 for the @xmath5 , and @xmath6 for the @xmath7 . )",
    "the confrontations of these expected properties of the nrqcd factorization formulas with experimental data are among the key tests of the nrqcd approach .",
    "the production of quarkonium at large @xmath1 in @xmath8 collisions provides a particularly important test of the nrqcd factorization approach . at a @xmath1 of several times the quarkonium mass ,",
    "the quarkonium production cross section is dominated by a process in which a gluon fragments into a quarkonium @xcite .",
    "other processes are suppressed by at least @xmath9 in the cross section .",
    "furthermore , the process in which the gluon fragments into the quarkonium through a color - octet heavy quark - antiquark ( @xmath10 ) channel dominates because it is enhanced by a factor @xmath11 relative to the color - singlet process @xcite .",
    "it was pointed out by cho and wise @xcite that a quarkonium that is produced through the color - octet process should have a substantial transverse polarization .",
    "the reason for this transverse polarization is that the fragmenting gluon is nearly on its mass shell , and , hence , is nearly completely transversely polarized .",
    "in the color - octet fragmentation process , that polarization is passed on to a produced @xmath10 pair , which then evolves into a quarkonium state . according to the velocity - scaling rules of nrqcd @xcite , the evolution of the @xmath10 pair into a quarkonium state is dominated by non - spin - flip interactions , which preserve the transverse polarization .",
    "spin - flip interactions are suppressed by at least @xmath12 .",
    "the prediction of substantial quarkonium transverse polarization at large @xmath1 relies not only on the validity of the nrqcd factorization formulas for quarkonium production , but also on the universality of the nrqcd matrix elements and the velocity - scaling rules .",
    "therefore , experimental measurements of the polarization prediction test many of the essential features of the nrqcd factorization formalism .",
    "such measurements are also important in that they can discriminate between the nrqcd factorization approach and the color - evaporation model , which predicts zero polarization for the produced quarkonium .",
    "there have been several calculations , based on the nrqcd factorization approach , of the polarization of the produced quarkonium as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "these include calculations of @xmath5 polarization at leading order in @xmath2 @xcite , at next - to - leading order in @xmath2 @xcite , and at next - to - leading order in @xmath2 , including the effects of feeddown from @xmath13 and @xmath14 states @xcite ; calculations of @xmath13 polarization at next - to - leading order in @xmath2 @xcite ; and calculations of @xmath7 polarization at next - to - leading order in @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "these calculations are generally in agreement with each other , although they are subject to large theoretical uncertainties , which arise mainly from uncertainties in the color - octet nrqcd matrix elements . the collider detector at fermilab ( cdf ) data for @xmath5 and @xmath13 polarization @xcite do not support either the prediction of substantial transverse polarization at large @xmath1 or the prediction of increasing transverse polarization with increasing @xmath1 .",
    "however , it must be said that only the points at the highest @xmath1 are more than @xmath15 standard deviations away from the predictions in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the case of the @xmath7 polarization",
    ", the cdf data @xcite agree with the prediction @xcite . however , the experimental error bars are too large to allow one to draw firm conclusions about the presence of substantial transverse polarization .    in light of the possible discrepancy between the predictions for @xmath5 and @xmath13 polarization and the cdf data",
    ", it seems worthwhile to investigate the sizes of uncalculated contributions to the theoretical cross sections . among such contributions",
    "are relativistic corrections , which begin in relative order @xmath12 .",
    "it is known in the case of quarkonium decay rates that such corrections can be of the same size as the leading contribution @xcite .",
    "investigations of relativistic corrections to quarkonium decays of order @xmath16 @xcite suggest that the order-@xmath12 contribution gives the bulk of the correction to the leading contribution .    in this paper",
    ", we calculate the relativistic corrections of relative order @xmath12 to the short - distance coefficients of both the color - octet and color - singlet terms in the fragmentation function for a gluon to fragment into a spin - triplet quarkonium state .",
    "we carry out the calculation at leading order in @xmath2 . in computing the short - distance coefficients ,",
    "we make use of the collins - soper definition of the fragmentation function in terms of a quantum chromodynamic ( qcd ) operator matrix element @xcite . in carrying out this calculation",
    ", we confirm the results for the short - distance coefficients at leading order in @xmath3 @xcite . as a check of our methods",
    ", we also compute the correction of relative order @xmath12 to the three - gluon decay rate of a spin - triplet quarkonium state and find that it agrees with the results of refs .",
    "we find that the relativistic correction to the color - octet fragmentation function is large and negative , while the correction to the color - singlet fragmentation function is large and positive .",

    "in this section we make use of the collins - soper definition of the fragmentation function @xcite to write , in terms of nrqcd operator matrix elements and short - distance coefficients , the fragmentation function for a gluon to fragment into a quarkonium state .",
    "the collins - soper definition was first used in a calculation of a quarkonium fragmentation function by ma @xcite .    here , and",

    "this function can be defined , in a light - cone gauge , in terms of the matrix element of a bi - local operator involving two gluon field strengths @xcite . in ref .",

    "the manifest gauge invariance of expression ( [ eq : d - def ] ) allows us to make use of the feynman gauge in order to simplify the calculation .    the definition ( [ eq : d - def ] ) is invariant under boosts along the longitudinal direction @xcite .",
    "the fragmentation function is defined in a frame in which the transverse momentum of the hadron @xmath23 is vanishes : @xmath40 .",
    "however , the fragmentation function is also invariant under boosts that change the transverse momentum of the hadron , while leaving the @xmath25 components of all momenta unchanged @xcite .",
    "[ this can be seen from the fact that the definition ( [ eq : d - def ] ) is manifestly covariant , except for dependences on the @xmath25 components of some quantities and on the dummy variable @xmath41 . ]",
    "an explicit construction of such a lorentz transformation is given in appendix  [ app : boost ] .",
    "however , for the purposes of this calculation , we find it convenient to work in the frame in which @xmath40 .",
    "in general , the fragmentation function ( [ eq : d - def ] ) involves the long - distance dynamics of the evolution of gluon into a quarkonium state and , hence , is a nonperturbative quantity .",

    "( [ eq : d - def ] ) is given in ref .",
