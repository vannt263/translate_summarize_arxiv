    "physical processes in qcd are gauge independent but unfortunately individual feynman diagrams are not . for that reason calculations",
    "may be greatly simplified with the choice of a convenient gauge , so as to minimize the presence of gauge - dependent terms in the intermediate steps . the background - field ( bf )",
    "gauge @xcite is one such gauge , partly because of its gauge - invariant property with respect to the external lines . the pinching technique @xcite used to simplify calculations is also known to be related to this gauge @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to discuss a graphical method for designing other convenient gauges .",
    "we start by pointing out the advantage and the flexibility of the graphical method over the conventional path - integral or operator technique .",
    "the gluon propagator @xmath3 will be used throughout , thus by a gauge choice we just mean the choice of vertices in making calculations .",
    "the bf vertices are different from the ordinary vertices in that its triple - gluon ( 3 g ) vertex makes a distinction between internal and external gluon lines , with the latter indicated graphically by an arrow ( see fig .",
    "7(a ) of the appendix ) and analytically possessing only four ( see eq .",
    "( 9 ) of the appendix ) rather than the usual six ( eq .  ( 17 ) and fig .  7(i ) ) terms .",
    "the gervais - neveu gauge @xcite would be another possible gauge choice in this sense .    in the usual approach , gauge choice",
    "is implemented by a gauge - fixing term in the path integral . in the bf gauge , for example , this term for the quantized yang - mills field @xmath4 is given by @xmath5 $ ] , with @xmath6 being an external classical yang - mills potential .",
    "the presence of @xmath6 is the reason why external lines play a special role in the bf gauge .    in a previous publication @xcite",
    "we have demonstrated how this and other gauge choices can be obtained in a graphical method , which we will summarize and extend in sec .  2 .",
    "similar techniques have also been employed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "essentially , in the graphical language , the fundamental difference between one gauge and another lies in their 3 g vertices , which differ from one another by a combination of gradient terms . to compensate for this difference changes will have to be made in other vertices as well , changes that can be computed using the graphical method . with this technique it is possible to make different changes on different vertices , each leading to a different compensation .",
    "in contrast , a gauge - fixing term in the path - integral or the operator formalism does not possess this flexibility ; whatever changes made to one vertex must be made on other identical vertices .",
    "hence we can design newer and simpler gauges using the graphical method that can not be obtained using the path - integral method .",
    "the generalized background - field [ gbf ] gauge discussed later is such a gauge , and we are also considering another one that is related to the gervais - neveu gauge @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .  2",
    ", we review and extend the graphical procedure for creating new gauges @xcite .",
    "the gbf gauge will be defined in sec .  3 , and the computation of the 2-loop @xmath0-function using this new gauge is presented in sec .  4 , with a conclusion in sec .  5",
    "to discuss gauge invariance graphically , it is convenient to use the chan - paton color factors @xcite and color - oriented diagrams @xcite .    in the absence of quarks ,",
    "the chan - paton color factors are given by the traces of products of the color matrices @xmath7 , and the products of such traces .",
    "in the presence of quarks , ordered products of the color matrices @xmath7 also enter .",
    "diagrammatic rules can be designed to compute the spacetime amplitudes for each of these color factors , by using _",
    "color - oriented diagrams_. the propagators of the color - oriented diagrams are the ordinary propagators ; their vertices are different but can be derived from the vertices of feynman diagrams .",
    "for one thing , color factors are no longer present in the vertices of the color - oriented diagrams . for another",
    ", the clockwise orientation of the lines emerging from each vertex is fixed in the color - oriented diagrams ( hence the name ) .",
    "these color - oriented vertices are given in eqs  ( 2.1 ) to ( 2.4 ) as well as fig .  1 of ref .",
    "[ 9 ] in the feynman gauge .    in what follows , when we talk about diagrams we mean the color - oriented diagrams , and when we talk about vertices we always refer to these color - oriented vertices .",
    "the graphical rules for gauge transformation of color - oriented diagrams have been discussed before @xcite . using these rules we can create new gauges not reachable in the path - integral formalism . by new gauges in this paper",
    "we shall mean new vertex factors ; the propagators used here will always be the usual feynman - gauge propagators .    to create a new gauge @xmath8 from an existing gauge @xmath6",
    ", we start by subtracting appropriate combinations of gradient terms from the triple - gluon ( 3 g ) vertices @xmath9 of gauge a , _ viz .",
    ", _ terms proportional to @xmath10 , and @xmath11 . such a gradient term will be denoted graphically by a cross ( @xmath12 ) on the appropriate gluon line .    to maintain gauge invariance and the same physical scattering amplitudes , other vertices must also be altered and/or created to compensate for this change . using graphical methods @xcite",
    "they can be computed in the following way .",
    "a gradient term on a 3 g vertex becomes a divergence on the subsequent vertex . to find out the effect of this change on the 3 g vertex",
    ", we need to know the divergence of every vertex possessing a gluon line in the original gauge @xmath6 .    if @xmath6 consists of the vertices of the ordinary feynman gauge given by eqs .",
    "( 2.1 ) to ( 2.4 ) and fig .  1 of ref",

    "( 2.5 ) to ( 2.8 ) and expressed graphically in figs .",
    "2 to 5 of that paper .",
    "if @xmath6 consists of the vertices of the background - field ( bf ) gauge given by eqs .",

    "1 and 18 of that paper , then these divergences can be similarly computed .",
    "the bf vertices are repeated here in the appendix , eqs .",

    "7(a ) to ( k ) .",
    "the result of the divergence computation can be found in figs .",
    "8 to 13 .",
    "the next step is to combine the right - hand side of the divergence relations from different diagrams . on account of local gauge invariance ,",
    "many of these terms add up to cancel one another . starting from the feynman gauge , these cancellation relations can be found in figs .",
    "7 to 16 of ref .",
    "starting from the bf gauge , similar relations can be worked out and they are shown in figs .",
    "14 to 17 in the appendix of this paper .",
    "this general scheme works in qed as well as qcd .",
    "what makes them different is the presence of ghost lines in the latter . among other things ,",
    "it gives rise to the presence of _ propagating diagrams _ in the divergence relation of 3 g and possibly 4 g vertices . these are diagrams in which two of the gluon lines are replaced by ghost lines ( we call them _ wandering ghost _",
    "lines ) , and the divergence ` cross ' at the beginning of a line is moved to the end of the other line , as in figs .",
    "3(d ) and 3(e ) of ref .",
    "[ 9 ] for the feynman gauge , and figs .",
    "8(d ) and 8(e ) of this paper for the bf gauge .",
    "via these diagrams , the divergence ` cross ' propagates along the diagram , dragging behind it the wandering ghost line .",
    "it is the presence of these diagrams that makes the slavnov - taylor identity in qcd different from the ward - takahashi identity in qed .",
    "if the cross propagates in a closed loop to return to its original position , then local gauge compensation will be upset , thus resulting in additional terms or vertices with two ghost lines .",
    "for example , if gauge @xmath6 is feynman and gauge @xmath8 is bf , then this change is given by fig .",
    "20 of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we started with the gradient change of a _ single _ 3 g vertex in gauge @xmath6 for every diagram , as described above , and considered the local cancellations and the new ghost vertices thus created for gauge @xmath8 . having converted one vertex this way , we are now ready to convert a _ second _ 3 g vertex from gauge @xmath6 to gauge @xmath8 .",
    "unless the second vertex is adjacent to the first , the same argument holds and the net change of the second vertex is identical to that of the first . if they are adjacent , additional changes may occur because the first 3 g and ghost vertices are already in gauge @xmath8 , while the second vertex is still in gauge @xmath6 . mixing @xmath6 and @xmath8 , local gauge cancellation",
    "will generally not occur , thus producing yet other new terms or vertices from this mismatch . in getting from the feynman gauge to the bf gauge in ref .",
    "@xcite , for example , this is how the new 4 g vertices are obtained through figs .",
    ".    we can continue this way to change _ all other _ vertices one after another from gauge @xmath6 to gauge @xmath8 . in principle , merging three or more adjacent vertices may produce newer vertices still , but this does not happen when we go from the feynman to the bf gauge , nor from the bf gauge to the gbf gauge as will be discussed in the next section .",
    "in this section we follow the outline of the last section to convert the bf gauge to a new gauge which we shall refer to as the gbf gauge .    in the bf gauge ,",
    "the 3 g vertices involving an _ external _ gluon are different from those without it .",
    "the former has four terms compared to the latter with six terms .",
    "the former is shown in fig .",
    "7(a ) of the appendix , in which the external line is represented by an arrow .",
    "the latter is just the usual 3 g vertex shown in fig .",
    "the aim of the gfb gauge is to convert _ all _ 3 g vertices to the former type with only four terms , so as to simplify the number of terms present and the algebra of the calculations .",
    "it is true that new vertices and diagrams will have to be produced to compensate for this change , but the overall saving turns out to be still substantial . in this paper , we confine ourselves to two - loop diagrams with an arbitrary number of external lines .",
    "in fact , we will carry out the explicit calculation only for two external lines but the technique can easily be generalized to an arbitrary number of external lines . with this restriction",
    "there are at most two internal 3 g vertices in the bf gauge that need be converted into the arrowed type .",
    "we will choose the arrows to appear on both ends of the ` middle propagator ' as shown in figs .",
    "6(a ) and 6(b ) of the next section .    as before ,",
    "let us make this change first on one of the two internal vertices .",
    "the change is identical to what happens when we convert from the feynman to the bf gauge , so nothing new will be produced .",
    "now we convert the second internal 3 g vertex to the arrowed form . via a series of propagating diagrams",
    ", the ` cross ' can return to this vertex via two possible routes .",
    "either it comes back via a line without an arrow , or it returns via the arrowed line .",
    "the former is identical to what happened before so it produces nothing new .",
    "the latter could not happen previously because the arrowed line in the bf gauge is always an external line .",
    "now in the gbf gauge , this new situation produces a new vertex shown in fig .  1 .",
    "in addition , adjacent interaction may now take place when the ghost line returns in a loop , and this produces further changes given by figs .",

    "the disadvantage of this example is that it is not an on - shell process , so the full - fledged simplification of the gbf gauge will not be revealed .",

    "we need 150 seconds for the gbf gauge , and 260 for the bf gauge . for on - shell process , because of the absence of the extra diagrams , the saving of the gbf gauge will be greater and can be expected to be approximately 50 percent .
