    "one of the oldest and still unsolved problems in nuclear physics is that of the determination of the electromagnetic current operator .",
    "the basic difficulty lies on the absence of useful constraints one can impose to this operator . for a long time , siegert theorem @xcite has played an important role in this respect , mainly because its application allows to avoid the consideration of two - body currents in the calculations . after the application of the theorem , the effects of such currents can be evaluated in terms of the charge contributions , the corrections of which are _ a priori _ small",
    ". however , siegert theorem only applies in the long - wavelength limit and then it is irrelevant for the values of the momentum transfers usually observed in electron scattering experiments .    in principle , one can think that current conservation , and more precisely the continuity equation ( ce ) , could provide the needed procedure .",
    "nevertheless , the task can not be accomplished due to the impossibility to fix in a unique manner the operator , because those terms given as the rotational of any function are not constrained by the ce .    using current conservation ,",
    "the longitudinal current is eliminated in terms of the charge operator , and the electron scattering cross section reads @xmath0\\ ] ] where @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 are the coulomb , electric and magnetic multipoles of the transition .",
    "it is common to rewrite the matrix elements of the electric transverse operators in terms of the charge matrix elements , by using the equations @xmath4 here we have defined the transition matrix elements @xmath5 of the multipole operators @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the electromagnetic current operator of the nucleus and @xmath8 labels a vector spherical harmonic .",
    "( [ tclambda ] ) is the multipole expression of the ce .",
    "it relates the charge multipoles to the longitudinal multipoles of the current .",
    "( [ telambda ] ) is the definition of the electric multipoles .",
    "( [ tclambda ] ) it is possible to eliminate one of the multipoles @xmath9 in terms of the coulomb @xmath1 multipole and substitute it in the expression of @xmath2 . in this way one can use the ce constraint even in the calculation of the transverse form factor .",
    "besides , this procedure allows to minimize the errors coming from an insufficient knowledge of the transverse current ( e.g. meson - exchange currents ) in electron scattering calculations .",
    "this method of rewriting the matrix elements of the electric transverse operator in terms of the charge matrix elements , has been applied traditionally in many electron scattering calculations . despite this",
    "ensures that ce is satisfied , the procedure is completely meaningless in models which do not satisfy the ce @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the problem of current conservation in model calculations of electron scattering by nuclei is still under theoretical study @xcite-@xcite .",
    "a similar situation appears in the relativistic treatment of the off - shell @xmath10 vertex in ( e , ep ) reactions .",
    "several prescriptions for the current operators obtained by extrapolating the on - shell currents have been proposed @xcite .",
    "the corresponding off - shell vertex operators violate current conservation , which is enforced by elliminating the 3- or 0-components using the continuity equation .",
    "the problem which arises is that different results are obtained depending on the option chosen @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach is provided by the so - called siegert current ( sc ) developed by friar and fallieros @xcite by extending the siegert s theorem to arbitrary wavelengths .",
    "this procedure is based on isolating the components of the current which are constrained by the ce and replacing them by an adequate combination of the charge multipoles . however , the results are not satisfactory @xcite because they show a pathological behavior for high momentum transfer when the nuclear model considered does not verify current conservation .",
    "this has been also pointed out recently by caparelly and de passos @xcite in rpa and tda calculations .",
    "two main conclusions of the work of friar and fallieros @xcite must be pointed out .",
    "first , the sc appears to be preferable to the traditional forms of the nuclear currents even for model which satisfy the ce , because the size of the exchange current operators is considerably reduced .",
    "second , they suggest that well behaved current operators , satisfying the constraints of current conservation for high momentum transfer , could be determined , but these new forms of the current have not been found up to know .    in this paper",
    "we present a new approach to obtain nuclear conserved currents .",
    "specifically we show that the sc appears as a particular case of a more general family of current operators which can be obtained from the ce . though all of them produce identical results in models conserving the current , they permit to formulate different prescriptions for restoring current conservation in electron scattering model calculations .",
    "besides , our formalism allows us to obtain explicitly the asymptotic behavior of these new currents .",
    "our method deals with the ce written in integral form ( sec .",
    "ii ) from which the new currents can be obtained directly both in coordinate and momentum spaces . our approach generalizes the friar and fallieros procedure and , as a consequence , permits to find , _ a priori _ , infinite ways of restoring the ce in models which do not conserve the current . in sec .",
    "iii we show how to do it and we study in detail the low and high momentum transfer behavior of the conserved currents found as well as that of their multipoles .",
    "to finish , in sec .",
    "iv we show some examples in a simple nuclear model .",
    "the conclusions are drawn in sec .",
    "usually , the ce is written in differential form as @xmath11 \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the hamiltonian and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the nuclear charge and current densities , respectively .",
    "this equation restricts the value of @xmath15 , once the density @xmath13 and the hamiltonian @xmath12 of the system are known , but , as mentioned above , it does not permit to fix completely the current because the rotational terms do not contribute to the divergence .",
    "the key point in our development consists in writing an integral equation equivalent to the ce . to do that , we start with the relation @xmath16 \\ , = \\ ,   2 { \\bf j}({\\bf r } ) + ( { \\bf r}\\cdot\\nabla){\\bf j}({\\bf r } ) \\ , .\\ ] ] taking into account the vector identity @xmath17\\ , = \\ ,",

    "other values of the parameter @xmath33 fulfilling the relation @xmath34 ( such as e.g. @xmath38 ) provide new currents potentially useful to restore the ce in model calculations . on the other hand ,",
