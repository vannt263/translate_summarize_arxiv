    "as compared to the other three methods that have successfully detected extrasolar planets , microlensing has unique features , both positive and negative . unlike pulsar timing @xcite , radial velocities ( @xcite ; @xcite , and references therein ) , and transits @xcite , which rely on the detection of photons from the host star and thus are biased toward nearby systems ,",
    "microlensing is sensitive to mass , and therefore can detect planets many kpc from the sun .",
    "microlensing is potentially very sensitive to extremely low - mass ( e.g. mars - like ) planets because , in contrast to all other methods , the strength of the signal can be quite large ( @xmath2 ) , and the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) falls with the planet mass only as @xmath3 . microlensing is unique in its ability to detect wide - separation planets with periods that exceed the duration of the experiment .",
    "microlensing , like most other indirect methods , is primarily sensitive to the planet - star mass ratio @xmath4 .",
    "however , the microlensing planet host stars are distant and superimposed on a background source star , so the brightness and mass of the host star are often only weakly constrained . just as the @xmath5 ambiguity for radial - velocity planet detections can be broken if the planet happens to transit its host , so microlensing can yield star and planet masses in special circumstances as well @xcite .",
    "microlensing detections occur only at a single epoch , so one measures only the planet - star separation at a particular moment , not the orbit .    to date",
    ", there has been only one robust detection of a planet using the microlensing technique @xcite .",
    "here we report on the second detection of a planet by microlensing , which was enabled by the rapid response of a number of observing teams to high - magnification ( high - mag ) microlensing events , which are intrinsically the most sensitive to planets .",
    "this detection demonstrates that the microlensing method has reached maturity , and that the planets to which the method is sensitive are not rare .",
    "when a stellar lens in a microlensing event has a planetary companion , the binary nature of the lens results in caustics ( closed curves of formally infinite magnification ) in the magnification pattern .",
    "if the source passes over or close to one of these caustics , the light curve exhibits a short - lived deviation from the standard @xcite single - lens form that betrays the presence of the planet @xcite .",
    "the great majority of planetary companions generate two distinct types of caustics : one `` central caustic '' that lies close to the host star and one or two `` planetary caustics '' depending on whether the planet lies outside or inside the einstein ring .",
    "as one moves the planet closer to the einstein ring , both types of caustics grow , and they eventually merge into a single `` resonant caustic '' .",
    "@xcite pointed out that planets in jupiter - like orbits around stars on the line of sight to the galactic bulge would coincidentally lie fairly close to the einstein ring .",
    "hence , they should generate large and so easily detectable planetary caustics .",
    "this optimistic assessment encouraged early efforts to detect planets . because planetary caustics are much larger than central caustics , in an unbiased sample of microlensing events the overwhelming majority of planetary anomalies will be generated by planetary caustics , and for this reason they were the focus of early efforts .",
    "nevertheless , central caustics play a crucial role in current microlensing planet searches .",
    "exactly because they are `` central '' , central caustics can be probed only in very high - mag events , i.e. , events in which the source passes very close to the primary lens and so to the central caustic .",
    "these events are very rare , but when they do occur , the source is essentially _ guaranteed _ to pass over or close to the central caustic if a planet is present @xcite .",
    "since very high - mag events can be identified as they are unfolding , they can be intensively monitored over their peak to a degree that is not feasible for the much more frequent garden - variety microlensing events . as a result ,",
    "modern microlensing followup groups like planet ( @xcite ) and @xmath6fun ( @xcite ) now tend to focus much of their effort on identifying and following the rare high - mag events .",
    "moreover , both of the major survey teams , ogle ( @xcite ) and moa ( @xcite ) , switch over from survey mode to followup mode when events undergo high - mag or other effects that warrant closer monitoring .",
    "the problem of identifying high - mag events is actually quite severe .",
    "the great majority of high - mag sources are faint , and as a result the photometry of the early light curve is generally too poor to accurately predict their high - mag character well in advance . as a result",
    ", fewer than a dozen high - mag @xmath7 events have been intensively monitored altogether @xcite .",
    "the ogle - iii early warning system ( ews , @xcite ) now annually alerts bulge microlensing events at the rate of 600 per year .",
    "this provides a potentially rich source of high - mag events . in order to better",
    "harvest this potential , as well as to react quickly to microlensing anomalies , ogle has now implemented the early early warning system ( eews ) , which detects anomalies in real time .",
    "the original alert on ogle-2005-blg-071 was triggered by ews @xcite on 17 march 2005 based on observations by ogle - iii .",
    "the alert predicted that the event would peak about 1 month later on hjd@xmath8hjd@xmath9 , with @xmath10 .",
    "based on a new ogle point ( hjd@xmath11 3477.9 ) less than 3 days before the lens - source point of closest approach , as well as its own data ( acquired starting hjd@xmath11 3472.7 ) , @xmath6fun issued a general alert ( hjd@xmath11 3478.20 ) that the event was peaking at high magnification .",
    "this triggered more intensive observations the next night by ogle and by @xmath6fun chile .",
    "a single - lens fit to these new observations resulted in substantially worse @xmath12 than previous fits , and so @xmath6fun then issued a second alert ( hjd@xmath11 3478.97 ) saying that an anomaly had begun .",
    "this was confirmed with the first ogle observation on the following night ( hjd@xmath11 3479.73 ) . at this point , both ogle and all @xmath6fun stations attempted to observe the event intensively and continued to do so for the next 4 nights .",
    "ogle was able to obtain data from chile during almost the entire period and indeed issued an eews alert on hjd@xmath11 3481.94 reporting on a second rise .",
    "two new zealand @xmath6fun observatories ( farm cove and auckland ) obtained substantial data including 6 continuous hours on the falling sides of each of the `` twin peaks '' of the light curve , and @xmath6fun observations from palomar observatory yielded coverage of the second peak , thereby bridging the rise and fall covered by ogle and farm - cove / auckland respectively .",
    "a small amount of additional data covering the second peak was obtained from kitt peak .",
    "moa immediately responded to the original high - mag alert to obtain data on the rise toward the first peak as well as all four nights of the anomaly .",
    "planet / robonet , which had already made pre - peak observations beginning hjd@xmath11 3470.1 , responded to the anomaly alert , catching the decline of the first peak from the faulkes north telescope in hawaii and the second from the canopus telescope ( tasmania ) .",
    "it was soon realized that the anomaly was short - lived and on hjd@xmath11 3482.9 the light curve returned to the normal single - microlens shape .",
    "the first results of modeling of the light curve of the event announced on hjd@xmath11 3483.9 by ogle suggested the possibility that the anomaly was due to a low mass companion , well into the planetary regime .",
    "this result was subsequently confirmed by independent modeling conducted by other teams .",
    "we present data from ogle ( 1.3 m at las campanas observatory in chile , operated by the carnegie institution of washington ) , moa ( 0.6 m telescope at mt .",
    "john university observatory in new zealand ) @xmath6fun chile ( smarts 1.3 m telescope at ctio ) , palomar ( @xmath13 robotic telescope ) , mdm ( hiltner 2.4 m at kitt peak ) , auckland ( 0.35 m nustrini telescope at auckland observatory ) , farm cove ( 0.25 m meade telescope at farm cove observatory ) , faulkes north ( 2.0 m in hawaii ) and canopus ( 1.0 m at hobart , tasmania ) .",
    "interval between peaks ( and so between cusps ) is @xmath14days , implying the shear induced by the companion is small , @xmath15 , so the mass ratio @xmath16 of the companion is also small , @xmath17 .",
    "more detailed fitting shows @xmath18 . , title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "figure [ fig : lightcurve ] shows the data from the various observatories together with a binary - lens model .",
    "the model shown has a very small mass ratio , @xmath18 , and is clearly a good fit to the data .",
    "the event is therefore consistent with a planetary lens , however the question remains whether there might be other non - planetary models that fit the data equally well , i.e.  binary - lens models with @xmath19 .",
    "binary lens models have 7 lens parameters plus @xmath20 flux parameters where @xmath21 is the number of observatory / filter combinations .",
    "three parameters are the same as for single lenses , the time of closest approach to the lens `` center '' @xmath22 , the impact parameter ( normalized to the angular einstein radius @xmath23 ) @xmath24 , and the einstein radius crossing time @xmath25 .",
    "three parameters specify the lens geometry , the mass ratio @xmath16 , the separation of the two components ( normalized to @xmath23 ) @xmath26 , and the angle of source - lens relative motion with respect to the binary axis @xmath27 .",
    "in addition , if the source is resolved by the magnification pattern , one must specify the ratio of the source size to the einstein radius , @xmath28 .",
    "finally , for each observatory / filter combination , there is a source flux @xmath29 and a background flux @xmath30 such that the total flux is @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the magnification .    given that the parameter space is obviously very large and somewhat complex , how do we know that there are no non - planetary solutions ?",
    "one way to tell is to conduct a wide search for solutions , which we have done .",
    "however , it is also useful to have analytic arguments to ensure that a solution is not lurking in a corner of parameter space that one did not try .",
    "the following argument rests just on the gross features of the light curve .",
    "first , the anomaly occurs near the peak of an otherwise normal event , when it is 3 magnitudes above baseline , so @xmath33 i.e. , the normalized source - lens separation is @xmath34 .",
    "this already implies that the caustic is small , and so must be either a central caustic ( generated by a wide or close companion ) or the `` central - caustic end '' of a resonant caustic .",
    "the central caustics of wide and close binaries ( with @xmath35 ) are mathematically nearly identical @xcite , and the central - caustic end of a resonant caustic is very similar to these .",
    "the twin - peaked structure can only be generated by the source passing close to , but not over , two cusps of this central caustic .",
    "peaks can also be caused by passing over a caustic , but in that case they are highly asymmetric , with a much faster rise for the first peak and a much faster decline for the second .",
    "this alternate scenario is clearly ruled out by the form of the light curve .",
    "third there is a small `` bump '' in between these two peaks .",
    "this can only be caused by passing a third , much weaker cusp .",
    "all of these features are matched by the caustic geometry shown in the inset and subinset to figure  [ fig : lightcurve ] and can not be matched by caustics that lack this three - pronged morphology .",
    "the fact that the two peaks are of almost equal height implies that the source must pass nearly perpendicular to the binary axis , @xmath36 .",
    "the fact that the middle peak is so much weaker than the outer two implies that the caustic is extremely asymmetric .",
    "such asymmetric caustics occur only when @xmath26 is close to unity : for @xmath37 or @xmath38 , the caustics are diamond - shaped . for definiteness",
    ", we now consider the wide - binary case @xmath39 .",
    "since the central caustic is similar to a @xcite caustic , its full width is equal to @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the shear , so the time to cross between these cusps is @xmath42 . equating this to the time between the peaks , @xmath43days , yields @xmath44 .",
    "since the blending is known from the full fit to the light curve , @xmath25 is well determined from the fit to the light curve away from the peak .",
    "however , even ignoring this information , the maximum @xmath16 can be found from the minimum allowed @xmath25 , which is obtained by assuming no blending .",
    "this minimum is @xmath45days .",
    "that is , @xmath46 or @xmath47 .",
    "this limit is already very close to the planet regime .",
    "moreover , the accumulated constraints on @xmath26 , @xmath16 , and @xmath27 imply that the allowed parameter space is small , and so was easily and exhaustively searched .",
    "a virtually identical argument applies to the @xmath48 case , yielding a planet of virtually the same mass .",
    "the best - fit parameters for both wide and close solutions are given in table  [ tab : pars ] .",
    "c@ c@ c@ c@ c@ c@ c@ c@ c@ c@ wide & 80.6791@xmath490.0020 & 0.0236@xmath490.0013 & 70.9@xmath493.3 & 0.0071@xmath490.0003 & 1.294@xmath490.002 & @xmath50 & 19.53 & 21.29 & 1105.6 + close & 80.6919@xmath490.0023 & 0.0225@xmath490.0012 & 73.9@xmath493.5 & 0.0067@xmath490.0003 & 0.758@xmath490.001 & @xmath51 & 19.59 & 21.05 & 1127.6 + [ tab : pars ]    the event is still in its late phases .",
    "when it reaches baseline a more detailed analysis of the light curve may permit measurements of additional parameters , in particular the mass of the lens star .",
    "based on a preliminary analysis of finite - source effects during the second peak and parallax effects in the wings of the event ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) we constrain the host mass to be @xmath52 , implying that the planet lies in the range @xmath53 .",
    "the corresponding range of distances is @xmath54 .",
    "we obtain an upper limit on the lens - star flux , @xmath55 , by analyzing good - seeing ogle images constrained by astrometry derived from a _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ image taken on hjd@xmath11 3513.6 .",
    "our estimate of the mass / distance range is fully consistent with this limit implying that the lens star can not be heavier . when a second _ hst _ image is taken after the event , the flux from the lens primary will be constrained even more precisely .",
    "the discovery of a planet in ogle-2005-blg-071 has several important implications .",
    "first , being the second such detection , it shows that microlensing planets are not a fluke .",
    "while the poisson statistics of a single detection were consistent with extremely low rates , two detections makes the low - rate hypothesis implausible .",
    "second , ogle-2005-blg-071 is the first secure high - mag planetary event .",
    "while @xcite long ago identified these central - caustic probing events as a potentially rich vein for planet hunting , the technical difficulties in recognizing high - mag event in real time and in adequately monitoring their peak have limited their application to a few events . with the coming on line of ogle eews and the increasing sophistication of followup teams , excellent coverage of high - mag events is becoming more common , if not quite routine .",
    "finally , in addition to being a fruitful path to planets in general , central - caustic events are at present the only practical method for finding earth - mass planets around main - sequence stars using current technology .",
    "although ogle-2005-blg-071 contains a giant planet , the fact that it was detected at extremely high s / n demonstrates that much lower - mass planets can also be detected .",
