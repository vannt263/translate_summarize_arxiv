    "radio pulsars are generally highly polarised sources , and the propagation of their radiation through the magneto - ionised interstellar medium ( ism ) is affected by faraday rotation .",
    "measurement of the rotation measure ( rm ) , combined with the dispersion measure ( dm ) for each pulsar , provides a good estimate of the average magnetic - field strength in the direction of the line of sight to many of the known pulsars . with the high sensitivity and broad bandwidths of current observing instruments , it is possible to accurately measure rms within a single band , thus avoiding calibration issues of observing with different receivers in different bands",
    ". furthermore , observing pulsars with high temporal resolution allows rm measurements at different pulse longitudes , provided the signal to noise ratio of the linearly polarised component is sufficient .",
    "ramachandran et al .",
    "( 2004 ) presented a phase - resolved rm analysis for psr b2016 + 28 . in an attempt to explain the variation in rm by @xmath2  rad  m@xmath1 across the pulse profile",
    ", they conducted a single - pulse analysis of the polarization .",
    "they found that there are clearly two , almost orthogonal polarization modes across the pulse profile , with slightly different spectra ( as also postulated in karastergiou et al .",
    "2005 and demonstrated in smits et al .",
    "superposition of these modes results in a net change in the polarization position angle with frequency , leading to the measurement of a variable rm across the pulse .",
    "although the effect measured in their study rotates the position angle ( pa ) with frequency , they concluded that it is not faraday rotation intrinsic to the pulsar magnetosphere .",
    "the authors clearly demonstrate that for psr b2016 + 28 the position angle does not have a quadratic dependence on wavelength : i.e.  @xmath3 .",
    "a very recent work by @xcite showed that even small amounts of interstellar scattering can significantly deform the steep features of pa profiles ( e.g.  orthogonal mode jumps ) , and can provide a simple explanation for the rm variations observed by ramachandran et al .",
    "the latter is caused by the frequency dependence of the scattering constant , which causes a frequency - dependent amount of polarised intensity to be transfered from a given phase bin to later phases .",
    "regions where the pa profile has a steep gradient are worst affected , since it is at those phases where the scattered portion of the polarised intensity has the most impact on the shape of the pa profile : flat profiles can only stay flat , but the kinks and wiggles in pa profiles will be distorted by the redistribution of the polarised intensity . hence , karastergiou noted that the polarization of core components , where pa profiles are steepest , is affected the most .",
    "the author concluded that scattering can smear orthogonal polarization modes so that they appear slightly less `` orthogonal '' .",
    "in this paper we concentrate on pulsars for which we have recently published rm values ( e.g. noutsos et al .",
    "our aim is not only to fit for pulse phase  resolved rms , as was done in ramachandran et al . , but to closely investigate whether the polarization position angles obey @xmath0 fits .",
    "we investigate the possible causes for this particular pa frequency dependence and discuss implications on rm measurements performed using different techniques .",
    "the data used in our analysis were collected with the parkes 64-m radio telescope during two observing periods : in 2004 , august 31 to septemeber 1 , and in 2006 , august 24 to 27 .",
    "we observed at the frequency band of the 20 cm h - oh receiver , installed at the focus cabin of the parkes telescope .",
    "the receiver is equipped with a pair of orthogonal , linear feeds that are sensitive to polarised emission with an equivalent system flux density of 43 jy at 20 cm ( johnston 2002 ) .",
    "the 2004 data were observed with a central frequency of 1.375 ghz and 256 mhz bandwidth , while in 2006 we observed with a central frequency of 1.369 ghz and 256 mhz bandwidth .",
    "the wide - band correlator ( wbc ) back end that was used in both observations is capable of splitting the available bandwidth into 1,024 frequency channels , on each of four polarizations , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and producing 10-s de - dispersed pulse subintegrations with up to 2,048 phase bins across the pulse profile .    in noutsos",
    "( 2008 ) , we outline the method used to derive a single rm value for each pulsar we observed . here",
    ", we performed the same analysis of the polarised emission in each longitude bin , across the total pulse width .",
    "our aim was to produce rm profiles as a function of longitude for each observed pulsar .",
    "prior to our analysis , the raw data from the wbc were subjected to the necessary process of rfi mitigation and polarization calibration .",
    "we processed the calibrated data using the psrchive software package @xcite .",
    "it is expected that the plane of linearly polarised emission will be rotated by the magnetised ism it traverses on its way to the earth : this is the well - known interstellar faraday effect .",
    "the amount of rotation , @xmath8 , for a given pulsar should be constant for a specific frequency but scales as @xmath9 across the observing band . by definition ,",
    "the rotation between frequency @xmath10 and infinite frequency gives the pa at frequency @xmath10 :    @xmath11    since the rm is a physical property of the ism , it is expected to be constant for a given ism configuration between the pulsar and the earth .",
    "its value depends on the magnitude and direction of the magnetic field , @xmath12 , along the propagation path of the polarised emission , @xmath13 ; the free - electron density , @xmath14 , along @xmath13 , and the length of @xmath13 ; it is given by the path integral    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is directed from the pulsar to the earth .",
    "apart from the pulsar distance , none of the remaining physical quantities , on which rm depends , are directly measurable .",
    "however , given a finite observing bandwidth , one can derive rm by fitting the pa across the band with the quadratic function of equation  [ eq : paeq2 ] .",
    "the pa of each bin @xmath17 in each frequency channel @xmath18 was calculated as @xmath19 .",
    "having previously developed the software capable of such quadratic fits ( see noutsos et al .",
    "2008 for details ) , we performed bin - wise fitting across the longitude range inside the pulse and derived a value of rm for each individual longitude bin . in order to increase the s / n per frequency channel , @xmath18 , before fitting across the whole available bandwidth we averaged the frequency channels by a factor 16 . for a single averaging factor , as is the case in this analysis , only the statistical error on each rm value can be calculated , and the fitting routine gives the best integer rm for each bin .",
    "finally , we plotted pulse profiles of the total flux density , the linear- and circular - polarization components , and the pa and rm profiles across the pulse ; we only plotted significant pa values with @xmath20 and rm values with @xmath21 rad m@xmath1 .",

    "if this phase offset is not accounted for , the calculation of the pa in each frequency channel will correspond to a pulse longitude that is shifted with respect to that at the reference frequency ; this may introduce a frequency - dependent shift in the pa of any given phase bin . in order to eliminate this as the cause of the observed rm variations ,",

    "we therefore rule out dm errors as a possible cause of rm variation .",
    "our analysis reveals that the rm profiles of pulsars with large rm variations are diverse : they can be as simple as the ` s'-shaped profiles of vela and psr j1056@xmath226258 or as complex as those of psr j1243@xmath226423 and psr j1644@xmath224559 .",
    "the peak - to - peak variation of those pulsars rms across their profiles was found to be as little as a few rad m@xmath1 ( e.g. vela in 2006 ) but also as large as 100 rad m@xmath1 , for psr j1056@xmath226258 . despite the hints of correlation between individual features in the flux and pa profiles and those in the rm profiles ( see e.g.  psr j1326@xmath225859 ) , in most cases these correlations seem coincidental . however , a general observation is that the greatest rm fluctuations across the pulse profile seem coincident with the steepest gradients of the pa profile , whereas pulsars with flat pa profiles show little or none at all rm variation .",
    "good examples that support this argument are psr j1243@xmath226423 and psr j2048@xmath221616 , whose rm departure from the mean is maximised around the inflexion point of the pa swing ; in contrast , psr j0907@xmath225157 and psr j1057@xmath225226 , having flat pa profiles , show insignificant rm variations .",
    "the subset of pulsars with low rm variations adheres to the theoretical predictions .",
    "more than half of those pulsars have phase - resolved rms that are scattered around their respective published rm value , thus showing convincingly longitude - independent rm values across the pulse .",

    "an interesting case is that of psr j0742@xmath222822 , where although no significant rm variations exist across the profile , the longitude - averaged rm across the pulse is higher in 2004 data than in 2006 .",
    "nevertheless , one has to be careful when drawing the above conclusions ; the main statement is that any rm variations with pulse phase are smaller than the statistical error of the measurement .",
    "we have demonstrated that the rm variations observed are not due to measurement errors , and that the pa rotation in all cases follows the @xmath0 law of faraday rotation . in the following we consider three possible explanations : ( a ) faraday rotation within the pulsar magnetosphere , ( b ) the superposition and frequency dependence of quasi - orthogonal polarization modes , and ( c ) interstellar scattering and its effects on the polarization .",

    "[ fig : poincare ] , where the tip of the poincar vector is plotted across 32 frequency channels .",
    "this plot demonstrates that , together with the pronounced effect of pa rotation ( around the vertical axis ) , a small and rather systematic change in the fraction of circular polarization can be seen .",
    "we obtained similar plots for four additional pulsars in our sample that displayed large rm variations : namely vela , psr j1243@xmath226423 , psr j1644@xmath224559 and psr j2048@xmath221616 . in nearly all cases",
    ", we found that the trace of @xmath52 on the poincar sphere does not strictly follow paths of constant latitude , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : poincare ] .    the wave modes in the cold and ionised ism",
    "are purely circularly polarised .",
    "therefore , the phase offset introduced by propagation through this medium results in the well - documented changes of the pa . on the contrary , in a medium of highly relativistic charged particles , the natural modes are close to linearly polarised ( sazonov 1969 ; melrose 1997a ) . as a consequence ,",
    "different phase offsets between the modes will result in a conversion between linear and circular polarization . in a pulsar s magnetosphere ,",
    "the observed degrees of circular polarization indicate that the natural wave modes are elliptically polarised , which suggests that propagation through this medium will generate some frequency - dependent conversion between linear and circular polarization .",
    "an extensive discussion on this can be found in @xcite .",
    "if such a generalised faraday rotation is taking place within the pulsar magnetosphere and giving rise to rm variations as well as changing the degree of circular polarization in the observed frequency band , we expect the greatest change in @xmath7 to coincide with the greatest variations in rm . in order to test this , we first calculated the fraction of circularly polarised intensity , @xmath53 , for each frequency channel across the band .",
    "the division by @xmath4 removes any fluctuations of @xmath7 caused by scintillation through the interstellar medium , whereas any change in @xmath7 that originates in the magnetoshpere should remain unaffected .",
    "subsequently , we fitted a linear function , @xmath54 , to the data and calculated the change in @xmath53 across the band , based on that function .",
    "this was done to get a good estimate of the total effect while minimizing the influence of instrumental noise .",
    "we found linear fits to describe the data sufficiently well .",
    "the resulting profiles of @xmath55 as a function of longitude , for vela , psr j1243@xmath226423 , psr j1326@xmath225859 , psr j1644@xmath224559 and psr j2048@xmath221616 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vdvprofiles ] . a side - by - side comparison of the rm and @xmath55 profiles , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vdvprofiles ] , makes clear that none of the pairs of profiles seems correlated .",
    "there is certainly little evidence that the maximum rm deviation from the mean and the maximum change in circular polarization across the band occur at the same pulse phase .",
    "therefore , to first order , the assumption that the observed rm variations are caused by magnetospheric faraday rotation is deemed unlikely .",
    "another factor that could potentially affect the measured rm is the _",
    "incoherent _ superposition of quasi - orthogonal modes of polarization ( see e.g.  ramachandran et al .",
    "the superposition of strictly orthogonal modes results in an observed pa of the strongest of the two modes , regardless of the ratio of the intensity of the modes ( e.g.  backer et al 1976 ; cordes et al .",
    "the reason is that orthogonal modes are represented by anti - parallel vectors on the poincare sphere ; regardless of their relative lengths , the addition is always pointing in the direction of either of the two modes .",
    "this is not the case for non - orthogonal modes : in this case , the sum of the mode vectors points at an angle that depends on the degree of non - orthogonality and the relative intensity of the modes . as a consequence , if the ratio of the mode intensities changes as a function of frequency , the observed pa will also rotate .",
    "the question is under what conditions this could resemble faraday rotation .    in the pulsars where significant rm variations are seen ,",
    "the variations often exceed 20 rad m@xmath1 across the pulse profile . at the frequency and bandwidth of these observations",
    ", this corresponds to a variation in pa by @xmath56 .",
    "therefore , in order for quasi - orthogonal polarization modes to present a possible explanation for the observed rm variations , they should be capable of inducing such a pa rotation .    from polarization studies of 18 pulsars in the european pulsar network ( epn ) archive ,",
    "@xcite conclude that the ratio of the average intensity of the orthogonal modes for those pulsars follows a power law with spectral index that does not typically exceed @xmath57 .",
    "assuming linear modes ( @xmath58 and @xmath59 ; the degree of circular polarization is generally very low ) , then at a reference frequency @xmath44 the mode intensity ratio is @xmath60 , and the form of this power law is @xmath61    for given values of @xmath62 , we can compute @xmath63 across the frequency band we are interested in : in this case , between 1300 and 1556 mhz .",
    "we have numerically computed the total rotation of the pa across the band ( hereafter @xmath64pa ) , for different values of @xmath62 and different angles of non - orthogonality , @xmath65 .",
    "the latter angle is defined on the poincar sphere as the supplementary to the angle between the two modes .",
    "figure [ fig : dpafunc ] shows @xmath64pa versus @xmath65 , for various values of @xmath62 , which equate to certain degrees of linear polarization .",
    "the plot on the left shows examples where @xmath66 as opposed to @xmath67 for the plot on the right .",
    "both plots show a set of lines corresponding to the same degrees of polarization , @xmath25% , which is approximately @xmath68 .",
    "two things are immediately evident : first , the greatest rotation of pa happens for small values of @xmath65 ; second , and most important , the only possibility that @xmath64pa@xmath69 occurs when the fractional polarization remains under 10% and only in the specific case where @xmath70 , i.e. the case where the mode with the steepest spectral index is brightest at the lowest frequency @xmath44 . in our data , there are clear examples of high @xmath64rm and high @xmath25% , the most prominent being vela and j1326@xmath225759 .",
    "it is therefore unlikely that non - orthogonal polarization modes provide a general explanation for the rm variations in the data .",
    "as was mentioned earlier in this paper , some of the pulsars we studied show signs of interstellar scattering in their flux profiles : vivid examples are psr j1056@xmath226258 , justified by its high dm of 320.3 pc @xmath71 , and psr j1644@xmath224559 , with a dm of 478.8 pc @xmath71  the highest in our sample .",
    "we checked for a possible correlation between the amount of interstellar scattering and the magnitude of the observed rm variations .",
    "the effect of interstellar scattering is usually quantified by the scattering timescale , @xmath72 . assuming a kolmogorov spectrum for the density fluctuations along the sightline to the pulsar , @xmath72 has a roughly quadratic relation to dm for low - dm pulsars ( i.e.  @xmath73 ) but can be much steeper for high - dm pulsars : i.e.  @xmath74 ( e.g.  sutton 1971 ; ricket 1977 ) .",
    "more recently , based on a global fit to 98 scattering times of high - dm pulsars , @xcite showed that a parabolic curve of the form    @xmath75    where @xmath44 is the observing frequency , is a reasonable description of the trend of @xmath72 as a function of dm .",
    "hence , as long as we are refering to the same observing frequency , and since there are only a few available measurements of @xmath72 for our pulsar sample ( see table  [ tab : pulprop ] ) , the dm is a convenient alternative to the amount of scattering a pulsar s emission is subject to .",
    "we have quantified the magnitude of the rm variations for those pulsars whose rm profiles show signs of a longitude - dependent structure , in terms of the peak - to - peak distance of their rm profile , @xmath76 .",
    "[ fig : drmmaxdm ] shows a scatter plot of @xmath76 against dm for 9 pulsars .",
    "although there is perhaps no clear correlation , it is striking that the pulsars that typify high rm variations are also high - dm pulsars .",
    "this includes the most prominent examples of rm variation with pulse phase , such as psr j1243@xmath226423 , psr j1326@xmath225859 and psr j1644@xmath224559 . in a recent paper",
    ", @xcite showed that small amounts of scattering and orthogonal polarization modes of emission in the pulsar magnetosphere can result in a frequency dependent pa that can be falsely attributed to faraday rotation .",
    "this explanation is extremely simple and may well be the key to understanding the high - dm examples .",
    "it is also strengthened by the observation that most of the low - dm pulsars show relatively smooth pa profiles , devoid of the bumps and wiggles seen in the higher dm profiles . the overall correlation in fig .",
    "[ fig : drmmaxdm ] is perhaps reduced by the fact that rm measurements can only be made for pulse phases with significant linear polarization .",
    "we have shown phase - resolved rm profiles for 19 pulsars , 9 of which show substantial rm variations across the pulse profile .",
    "these variations appear in most cases to show coherent rather than noisy behaviour .",
    "the high s / n of our data and our robust fitting technique have shown that whatever the cause of the pa rotation with frequency , it is inseparable from the @xmath9 law of interstellar faraday rotation within our observed band .    we have considered a number of possibilities that may result in the observed phenomena . for example , we have ruled out the possibility that de - dispersion with a slightly erroneous dm may be responsible for the data here . we have discussed the possibility that the rm variations are of magnetospheric origin .",
    "two cases were examined , that of generalised faraday rotation due to the relativistic plasma in the pulsar magnetospheres , and the existence and superposition of quasi - orthogonal modes of polarization .    in the case of generalised faraday rotation , we examined whether pulse phases with the highest rotation of the pa also showed the highest change of the fractional circular polarization .",
    "our first - order investigation turned out negative results , although it is true that the theory for generalised faraday rotation is not complete and does not provide us with good handles on the rate at which polarization rotations occur with frequency .    as concerns quasi - orthogonal modes , we find that it is impossible to obtain a large rotation of the pa within our observing frequency band and observe large degrees of linear polarization at the same time .",
    "our analysis indicates that there are specific cases of the data that can be explained by this process , but it certainly does not form a general framework for explaining rm variations across the pulse .    finally , this work supports the ideas presented in @xcite , that interstellar scattering can distort the polarization in a frequency - dependent way .",
    "this may resemble faraday rotation and will generally be pulse - phase dependent .",
    "it is important to emphasise that the possibility of magnetospheric faraday rotation is not totally eliminated by this work ; we merely conclude that it is an unlikely explanation for rm variations of the observed magnitude .",
    "there is a possibility that both the magnetospheric mechanisms and interstellar scattering are responsible for the observed rm variations , along with other possibe mechanisms which we have not considered . whichever the explanation , certain care must be taken during rm - determination experiments from pulsars to correctly identify the amount of pa rotation that is due to the iono - magnetised interstellar medium . especially for the studies of the planar component of the galactic magnetic field , where pulsars with high dms and rms are used , the identification of the ism - induced faraday rotation and the correct calculation of the associated rm plays an important role in our efforts to model the interstellar magnetic fields .",
    "hence , in light of the rm profiles presented herein , pulsar - rm determination from specific , high - s / n pulse bins can lead to considerable errors .",
