    "symmetries are ubiquitous in discrete mathematics and geometry .",
    "they are often responsible for the tractability of algorithmic problems and for the beauty of both the investigated structures and the developed methods .",
    "it is common knowledge , however , that the presence of symmetries in integer programs may severely harm the ability to solve them .",
    "the reasons for this are twofold .",
    "first , the use of branch - and - bound methods usually leads to an unnecessarily large search tree , because equivalent solutions are found again and again .",
    "second , the quality of lp relaxations of such programs typically is extremely poor .",
    "a classical approach to `` break '' such symmetries is to add constraints that cut off equivalent copies of solutions , in hope to resolve these problems .",
    "there are numerous examples of this in the literature ; we will give a few references for the special case of graph coloring below .",
    "another approach was developed by margot  @xcite .",
    "he studies a branch - and - cut method that ensures to investigate only one representative of each class of equivalent solutions by employing methods from computational group theory .",
    "furthermore , the symmetries are also used to devise cutting planes .",
    "methods for symmetry breaking in the context of constraint programming have been developed , for instance , by fahle , schamberger , and sellmann  @xcite and puget  @xcite .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to start an investigation of the polytopes that are associated with certain symmetry breaking inequalities . in order to clarify the background , we first discuss the example of a well - known integer programming ( ip ) formulation for the graph coloring problem .",
    "let @xmath2 be a loopless undirected graph without isolated nodes .",
    "a _ ( vertex ) coloring _ of @xmath3 using at most  @xmath4 colors is an assignment of colors @xmath5 to the nodes such that no two adjacent nodes receive the same color .",
    "the _ graph coloring _ problem is to find a vertex coloring with as few colors as possible .",
    "this is one of the classical np - hard problems  @xcite .",
    "it is widely believed to be among the hardest problems in combinatorial optimization . in the following classical ip formulation ,",
    "@xmath6 are the nodes of  @xmath3 and  @xmath4 is some upper bound on the number of colors needed .",
    "@xmath7         & x_{ij } + x_{kj }          & \\leq y_j & \\{i , k\\ } \\in e,\\ ; j \\in \\{1,\\dots , c\\ } & \\text{(i)}\\\\         & { \\displaystyle \\sum}_{j=1}^{c } x_{ij } & =   1      & i \\in v & \\text{(ii)}\\\\         & \\multicolumn{2}{r}{x_{ij } \\in \\{0,1\\ } } & i \\in v,\\ ; j \\in \\{1,\\dots , c\\ } & \\text{(iii)}\\\\         & \\multicolumn{2}{r}{y_j \\in \\{0,1\\ } } & j \\in \\{1 , \\dots , c\\ } & \\text{(iv ) } \\end{array}\\ ] ] in this model , variable @xmath8 is  @xmath1 if and only if color  @xmath9 is assigned to node  @xmath10 and variable  @xmath11 is  @xmath1 if color  @xmath9 is used",
    ". constraints  ( i ) ensure that color  @xmath9 is assigned to at most one of the two adjacent nodes  @xmath10 and  @xmath12 ; it also enforces that  @xmath11 is  @xmath1 if color  @xmath9 is used , because there are no isolated nodes .",
    "constraints  ( ii ) guarantee that each node receives exactly one color .",
    "it is well known that this formulation exhibits symmetry : given a solution @xmath13 , any permutation of the colors , i.e. , the columns of  @xmath14 ( viewed as an @xmath15-matrix ) and the components of  @xmath16 , results in a valid solution with the same objective function value . viewed abstractly , the symmetric group of order  @xmath4 acts on the solutions @xmath17 ( by permuting the columns of  @xmath14 and the components of  @xmath16 ) in such a way that the objective function is constant along every orbit of the group action .",
    "each orbit corresponds to a symmetry class of feasible colorings of the graph . note that `` symmetry '' here always refers to the symmetry of permuting colors , not to symmetries of the graph .",
    "the weakness of the lp - bound mentioned above is due to the fact that the point @xmath18 with @xmath19 and @xmath20 is feasible for the lp relaxation with objective function value  @xmath21 .",
    "the symmetry is responsible for the feasibility of @xmath18 , since  @xmath22 is the barycenter of the orbit of an arbitrary  @xmath23 satisfying ( ii ) in  .",
    "it turned out that the symmetries make the above ip - formulation for the graph coloring problem difficult to solve .",
    "one solution is to develop different formulations for the graph coloring problem .",
    "this line has been pursued , e.g. , by mehrotra and trick  @xcite , who devised a column generation approach .",
    "see figueiredo , barbosa , maculan , and de souza  @xcite and cornaz  @xcite for alternative models .    another solution is to enhance the ip - model by additional inequalities that cut off as large parts of the orbits as possible , keeping at least one element of each orbit in the feasible region .",
    "mndez - daz and zabala  @xcite showed that a branch - and - cut algorithm using this kind of symmetry breaking inequalities performs well in practice .",
    "the polytope corresponding to   was investigated by camplo , corra , and frota  @xcite and coll , marenco , mndez - daz , and zabala  @xcite .",
    "ramani , aloul , markov , and sakallah  @xcite studied symmetry breaking in connection with sat - solving techniques to solve the graph coloring problem .    the strongest symmetry breaking constraints that mndez - daz and zabala  @xcite introduced are the inequalities @xmath24 from each orbit , they cut off all points except for one representative that is the maximal point in the orbit with respect to a lexicographic ordering .",
    "a solution @xmath17 of the above ip - model is such a representative if and only if the columns of  @xmath14 are in decreasing lexicographic order .",
    "we introduce a generalization and strengthening of inequalities   in section  [ sec : ipformulations ] .",
    "breaking symmetries by adding inequalities like   does not depend on the special structure of the graph coloring problem .",
    "these inequalities single out the lexicographic maximal representative from each orbit ( with respect to the symmetric group acting on the columns ) of the whole set of all 0/1-matrices with exactly one @xmath1-entry per row .",
    "the goal of this paper is to investigate the structure of general `` symmetry breaking polytopes '' like the convex hull of these representatives .",
    "we call these polytopes _ orbitopes_. the idea is that general knowledge on orbitopes ( i.e. , valid inequalities ) can be utilized for different symmetric ips in order to address both the difficulties arising from the many equivalent solutions and from the poor lp - bounds . in particular with respect to the second goal , for concrete applications it will be desirable to combine the general knowledge on orbitopes with concrete polyhedral knowledge on the problem under investigation in oder to derive strengthened inequalities . for the example of graph coloring , we indicate that ( and how ) this can be done in section  [ sec : closingremarks ] . figure  [ fig : genericillustration ] illustrates the geometric situation .    the case of a symmetric group acting on the columns",
    "is quite important .",
    "it does not only appear in ip - formulations for the graph coloring problem , but also in many other contexts like , e.g. , block partitioning of matrices  @xcite , @xmath12-partitioning in the context of frequency assignment  @xcite , or line - planning in public transport  @xcite .",
    "however , other groups are interesting as well . for instance , in the context of timetabling in public transport systems  @xcite , cyclic groups play an important role .",
    "we thus propose to study different types of orbitopes , depending on the group acting on the columns of the variable - matrix and on further restrictions like the number of @xmath1-entries per row being exactly one ( _ partitioning _ ) , at most one ( _ packing _ ) , at least one ( _ covering _ ) , or arbitrary ( _ full _ ) .        the main results of this paper are complete and irredundant linear descriptions of packing and partitioning orbitopes for both the symmetric group and for the cyclic group acting on the columns of the variable - matrix .",
    "we also provide ( linear time ) separation algorithms for the corresponding sets of inequalities .",
    "while this work lays the theoretical foundations on orbitopes , a thorough computational investigation of the practical usefulness of the results will be the subject of further studies ( see also the remarks in section  [ sec : closingremarks ] ) .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : basicorbitopes ] , we introduce some basic notations and define orbitopes . in section  [ sec : optimizingoverorbitopes ] we show that optimization over packing and partitioning orbitopes for symmetric and cyclic groups can be done in polynomial time . in section  [ sec : packingandpartitioningorbitopesforcyclicgroups ] we give complete ( totally unimodular ) linear descriptions of packing and partitioning orbitopes for cyclic groups .",
    "section  [ packingandpartitioningorbitopesforsymmetricgroups ] deals with packing and partitioning orbitopes for symmetric groups , which turn out to be more complicated than their counterparts for cyclic groups . here , besides ( strengthenings of ) inequalities",
    ", one needs exponentially many additional inequalities , the `` shifted column inequalities '' , which are introduced in section  [ sec : shiftedcolumninequalities ] .",
    "we show that the corresponding separation problem can be solved in linear time , see section  [ sec : separationalgorithmforscis ] .",
    "section  [ sec : completeinequalitydescriptions ] gives a complete linear description , and section  [ sec : facets ] investigates the facets of the polytopes .",

    "furthermore , we will restrict attention to packing and partitioning orbitopes .",
    "for these , we have the following convenient characterizations of vertices :    [ obs : charvert ]    a matrix of @xmath46 is contained in @xmath64 if and only if its columns are in non - increasing lexicographic order ( with respect to the order @xmath45 defined above ) .",

    "assume a polytope  @xmath723 is described by some ( finite ) system  @xmath724 of linear equations and inequalities .",
    "suppose that  @xmath725 is a subsystem of  @xmath724 for which it is known that  @xmath725 defines an integral polytope @xmath726 .",
    "one can prove that  @xmath727 is integral by showing that every vertex  @xmath352 of  @xmath727 is a vertex of  @xmath728 in the following way .",
    "here we call a basis ( with respect to  @xmath724 ) of  @xmath352 _ reduced _ if it contains as many constraints from  @xmath725 as possible :    [ item : remarks : weight ] starting from an arbitrary reduced basis  @xmath375 of  @xmath352 , construct iteratively a reduced basis  @xmath729 of  @xmath352 that satisfies some properties that are useful for the second step .",
    "such a proof is conceivable for every 0/1-polytope  @xmath727 by choosing  @xmath732^n$ ] as the whole @xmath0-cube and  @xmath725 as the set of the @xmath733 trivial inequalities @xmath734 , for @xmath735 ( if necessary , modifying  @xmath724 in order to contain them all ) .",
    "we do not know whether this kind of integrality proof has been used in the literature",
    ". it may well be that one can interpret some of the classical integrality proofs in this setting .",
    "anyway , it seems to us that the technique might be useful for other polytopes as well .      as mentioned in the introduction , for concrete applications like the graph coloring problem one can ( and probably has to ) combine the polyhedral knowledge on orbitopes with the knowledge on problem specific polyhedra .",
    "we illustrate this by the example of clique inequalities for the graph coloring model   described in the introduction .",
    "fix a color index @xmath736}$ ] .",
    "if @xmath737 is a clique in the graph @xmath738 , then clearly the inequality @xmath739 is valid .",
    "in fact , the strengthened inequalities @xmath740 are known to be facet - defining for the convex hull of the solutions to  , see  @xcite .",
    "suppose that @xmath741 is a shifted column and that we have @xmath742 for all @xmath261 with @xmath743 .",
    "then the inequality @xmath744 is valid for all solutions to the model obtained from   by adding inequalities   ( which are all `` column inequalities '' in terms of orbitopes ) , see figure  [ fig : cliquesci ] .",
    "the details and a computational study will be the subject of a follow - up paper .        with respect to cyclic group actions , we loose the simplicity of the characterizations in observation  [ obs : charvert ] .",
    "the reason is that the matrices under investigation may have several equal nonzero columns .",
    "in particular , the lexicographically maximal column may not be unique .    with respect to the action of the symmetric group",
    ", we still have the characterization of the representatives as the matrices whose columns are in non - increasing lexicographic order ( see part  [ obs : charvert : sym ] of observation  [ obs : charvert ] ) .",
    "the structures of the respective full and covering orbitopes , however , become much more complicated . in particular , we know from computer experiments that several powers of two arise as coefficients in the facet - defining inequalities .",
    "this increase in complexity is reflected by the fact that optimization of linear functionals over these orbitopes seems to be more difficult than over packing and partitioning orbitopes ( see the remarks at the end of section  [ sec : optimizingoverorbitopes ] ) .",
    "let us close with a comment on our choice of the set of representatives as the maximal elements with respect to a lexicographic ordering ( referring to the row - wise ordering of the components of the matrices )",
    ". it might be that the difficulties for full and covering orbitopes mentioned in the previous paragraph can be overcome by the choice of a different system of representatives .",
    "the choice of representatives considered in this paper , however , seems to be appropriate for the packing and partitioning cases .",
    "whether the results presented in this paper are useful in practice will turn out in the future . in any case , we hope that the reader shares our view that orbitopes are neat mathematical objects .",
    "it seems that symmetry strikes back by its own beauty , even when mathematicians start to fight it .",
    "we thank the referees for their work .",
    "in particular , we are indepted to one of them for several insightful and constructive remarks , including the proof of theorem  [ thm : orbipackcycl ] that we have in this final version .",
    "we furthermore thank yuri faenza , andreas loos , and matthias peinhardt for helpful comments .",
