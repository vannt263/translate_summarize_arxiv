    "log - normal multiplicative martingales were introduced by mandelbrot @xcite in order to build random measures describing energy dissipation and contribute explaining intermittency effects in kolmogorov s theory of fully developed turbulence ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , his model was difficult to be mathematically founded in complete rigor and this is why he proposed in @xcite the simpler model of random multiplicative cascades whose detailed study started with kahane s and peyrire s notes  @xcite , improved and gathered in their joint paper  @xcite .    from that moment on , multiplicative cascades have been widely used as reference models in many applications . however , they possess many drawbacks related to their discrete scale invariance , mainly they involve a particular scale ratio and they do not possess stationary fluctuations ( this comes from the fact that they are constructed on a @xmath2-adic tree structure ) . in the eighties ,",
    "kahane @xcite came back to mandelbrot s initial model and developed a continuous parameter theory of suitable multifractal random measures , called gaussian multiplicative chaos .",
    "his efforts were followed by several authors @xcite coming up with various generalizations at different scales .",
    "this family of random fields has found many applications in various fields of science , especially in turbulence and in mathematical finance .",
    "briefly , a gaussian multiplicative chaos can be formally understood as a random measure on the borelian subsets of ( a domain of ) @xmath3 of the form @xmath4}\\,dx,\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is a centered gaussian field and @xmath6 is the lebesgue measure . in his seminal work @xcite",
    ", kahane showed that the only short scale behaviour of the correlations of the field @xmath7 that produces interesting measures is logarithmic . in the case of logarithmic correlations",
    ", it is standard to rewrite equation as @xmath8}\\,dx,\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is a parameter , sometimes called intermittency parameter or coupling constant depending on the context , and @xmath7 is a centered gaussian field with covariance of the form : @xmath10=\\ln_+\\frac{1}{|x - y|}+g(x , y)\\ ] ] for some continuous bounded function @xmath11 ( and @xmath12 ) .",
    "interestingly and in this context , these measures present a phase transition : they are non trivial if and only if @xmath13 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "let us also mention that in @xcite , kahane made a thorough study of these measures ( existence of moments , non degeneracy , etc ... ) .",
    "recently and in a major conceptual step , the authors in @xcite have drawn attention on the fact that 2d - gaussian multiplicative chaos should be considered to give a rigorous meaning to the liouville measure in liouville quantum gravity ( see @xcite among many others ) . based on @xcite ,",
    "they argue that the field @xmath7 in has to be a gaussian free field ( gff for short ) to obtain the liouville measure ( see @xcite for the construction of the measures ) . in this context",
    ", the kpz formula has been proved rigorously @xcite ( see also @xcite in the context of multiplicative cascades ) below the phase transition arising at @xmath14 ( i.e. @xmath15 with @xmath16 ) , where the constant @xmath17 is related to the central charge @xmath18 of the underlying conformal field theory by the relation ( see @xcite ) @xmath19 actually , the above relation produces two different solutions ( for @xmath20 ) , a first one in @xmath21 and a second one @xmath222,+\\infty[$ ] , both of them satisfying the relation @xmath23 .",
    "the mathematical investigations in @xcite ( based on a huge amount of physics papers ) deal with the @xmath24 solution , called the _ standard branch of gravity_. physicists have also investigated the implications of the existence of the other solution @xmath222,+\\infty[$ ] , starting with the works @xcite , in what they called the _ non - standard branch of gravity _ or the _ dual branch of gravity_. it is clear that kahane s theory does not allow to go beyond the @xmath14 threshold so that one has to look for other types of measures than those considered in @xcite to explain the _ dual branch of gravity _ ,",
    "i.e. to construct mathematically singular liouville measures beyond the phase transition ( i.e. for @xmath25 ) .",
    "if one considers mandelbrot s multiplicative cascades as a powerful toy model to understand the continuous model , or gaussian multiplicative chaos , then one has to go back to durrett and liggett s deep paper @xcite to have a rather good intuitive picture .",
    "the authors solve in full generality an equation , called mandelbrot s star equation , which is satisfied by the law of the total mass of the limit of a non degenerate mandelbrot multiplicative cascade , and describes the scale invariance of such a measure .",
    "however this equation captures the scale invariance of a larger class of random measures , among which limit of mandelbrot cascades are characterized as being those with total mass in @xmath26 . sticking to our notations , when @xmath27",
    ", one can deduce from @xcite that the random measure associated with the star equation can be nothing but the derivative ( in the distribution sense ) of a stable subordinator subordinated by a sub - critical multiplicative cascade ( @xmath24 ) or a stable subordinator subordinated by the critical multiplicative cascade ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "we do not detail here what the critical case is but we refer the reader to @xcite for recent results in the topic of gaussian multiplicative chaos and an extensive list of references about the origins of this concept in various related models .",
    "a continuous analog of the mandelbrot s star equation , called star scale invariance , has been introduced in @xcite so that one is left with the intuition that the same picture can be drawn for gaussian multiplicative chaos . among the two options",
    "we are left with ( subordinating by a sub - critical gaussian multiplicative chaos or a critical gaussian multiplicative chaos ) , it turns out that subordinating by a critical gaussian multiplicative chaos can not be a suitable model for duality . indeed",
    ", such measures do not satisfy the expected kpz relations ( see below ) .",
    "so , duality must necessarily correspond to subordinating by a sub - critical gaussian multiplicative chaos .",
    "we also stress that the notion of star scale invariance is nothing but a rigorous formulation of the scaling heuristics developed in @xcite to quantify the measure of a euclidean ball of size @xmath29 ( see in particular the section _ liouville quantum duality _ ) .",
    "let us further stress that the concept of subordinating sub - critical gaussian multiplicative chaos by lvy processes has been studied for the new and fundamental examples of multifractal formalism illustrations it provides @xcite .",
    "this general procedure consisting in subordinating self - similar processes by nice multifractal measures to create new models of multifractal processes has been pointed out by mandelbrot , in particular in @xcite . after posting several versions of this paper online , we learnt the existence of @xcite where the author suggests to use the subordination procedure to model the dual branch of gravity , confirming in a way the above heuristics . as pointed out in @xcite , the subordination procedure in dimension higher than @xmath30",
    "requires a small additional mathematical machinery . indeed , while in dimension @xmath30 it is enough to subordinate a standard stable subordinator by an independent gaussian multiplicative chaos @xcite , in higher dimensions the canonical construction is to define a stable independently scattered random measure @xcite conditionally on a random intensity , which is given by a gaussian multiplicative chaos .",
    "we give here a simple argument to prove that this can be achieved in a measurable way , thus justifying the fact that the measure proposed in @xcite is mathematically founded ( see remark [ rem.otherlaw ] ) .",
    "another natural construction of such measures is to let a multiplicative chaos act on independent atomic measures : this is the first main issue of this paper . though producing the same measure in law as the subordination procedure , it is conceptually more powerful and flexible . to motivate this comment , we first draw up the framework a bit more precisely and",
    "we will come back to this point thereafter .",
    "fix a simply connected domain @xmath31 . for @xmath32 , the _ standard liouville measure _",
    "can formally be written as @xmath33}\\,dx\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the gaussian free field ( gff ) over the domain @xmath34 .",
    "in fact and to be exhaustive , @xmath35}\\,h(x)dx$ ] where @xmath36 is a deterministic function defined in terms of the conformal radius , but this additional term @xmath37 does not play a role in the nature of the problems / results we want to address here . for a given compact set @xmath38 ,",
    "it has been proved that the hausdorff dimension of @xmath39 computed with the euclidian metric , call it @xmath40 , is related to the hausdorff dimension of @xmath39 computed with the measure @xmath41 , call it @xmath42 .",
    "the connection is the so - called kpz formula @xmath43 the measure based approach of duality in liouville quantum gravity is about constructing purely atomic random measures @xmath44 , for parameter values @xmath27",
    "( i.e. beyond the phase transition ) , that satisfy the kpz relation @xmath45 then , by considering the dual value @xmath46 of the parameter @xmath47 , one wants to rigorously establish the duality relation @xmath48 we point out that physicists can recover the ( more classical ) relation between the scaling exponents by setting @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "proving rigorously the dual kpz formula is the second main point of our paper .",
    "let us also mention that scaling heuristics have been developed in @xcite .",
    "it is not straithforward to derive a rigorous kpz statement from @xcite as it involves working under the peyrire measure which in the dual context is infinite ( the authors of @xcite call this measure the rooted measure ) .",
    "consider @xmath510,1[$ ] and define a random measure @xmath44 , the law of which is given , conditionally to @xmath41 , by a independently scattered @xmath52-stable random measure with control measure @xmath41 .",
    "more precisely and conditionally to @xmath41 , we consider a poisson random measure @xmath53 distributed on @xmath54 with intensity @xmath55 then the law of the dual measure is given by @xmath56 this is the subordination procedure proposed in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we feel that this construction suffers a conceptual drawback : there is no way to obtain this measure as the almost sure limit of a properly regularized sequence , meaning of a sequence where the gff distribution has been suitably regularized via a cutoff procedure .",
    "this point is important .",
    "indeed , if one has a look at the original physics motivations @xcite , dual gravity should be produced by  pinching \" suitably the random field under consideration : in @xcite , the terminology ",
    "finely tuned \" is used in the context of random matrix theory . in terms of planar maps",
    ", this should correspond to creating enhanced bottlenecks in the planar map @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is natural to think that this pinching will have the effect of creating a bi - randomness : production of atoms on the one hand and creation of a multiplicative chaos term on the other hand .",
    "these two terms are likely to mix together to produce a random measure , the law of which is given by .",
    "for instance , we roughly explain a scenario that may produces such measures .",
    "consider a random measure on a bounded open subset of @xmath57 with density given by the exponential of random field .",
    "assume that this field is dominated by two independent scales : a first one with strong local interactions like a ( regularized ) gff and a second independent scale with a stronger independence structure which , for instance , macroscopically behaves like a random energy model ( rem for short ) .",
    "if the temperature of the rem scale is low enough , the rem - like scale component will macroscopically behave like an independent stable random measure .",
    "therefore , after suitable renormalization , the random measure is well approximated by the exponential of a gff integrated by an independent stable random measure . we will call these measures _ atomic gaussian multiplicative chaos_. observe that the location of the atoms is here independent of the gff , unlike the subordination procedure where position of atoms is strongly coupled to the realization of the underlying gaussian multiplicative chaos .",
    "it is therefore interesting to study the convergence of such a structure , if possible in a strong sense like almost sure convergence or convergence in probability .",
    "we further stress that this point has never been investigated either in the whole literature of gaussian multiplicative chaos or in the literature concerning closely related models : branching random walks , multiplicative cascades or branching brownian motions .",
    "the rough picture we have just drawn can be mathematically formulated as follows .",
    "consider a couple of exponents @xmath58 such that @xmath59 and @xmath23 ( this relation between the exponents may be explained via a volume preserving condition , see section [ sec : kpz ] ) .",
    "introduce an independently scattered random measure @xmath60 characterized by its laplace transform ( @xmath61 stands for the lebesgue measure of @xmath62 ) @xmath63=e^{-u^\\alpha|a|}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 . consider a suitable cutoff approximation family @xmath65 of the gff distribution ( see section [ back ] for a discussion about possible cutoff procedures ) .",

    "indeed the lognormal weight is not normalized to have expectation @xmath30 and the above renormalization is therefore not standard .",
    "actually , the expectation explodes giving rise to a strong competition between the atoms produced by the random measure @xmath60 and the ability of the lognormal weight to kill these atoms",
    ".    we will prove that the measure @xmath68 converges almost surely along deterministic subsequences , giving sense to a new and exciting theory of ( non - standard ) multiplicative chaos with respect to atomic measures .",
    "it may be worth mentioning here that this construction produces , as expected from @xcite , star scale invariant random measures for suitable choices of the distribution @xmath7 . beyond the applications in liouville quantum gravity",
    ", we have the feeling that this approach offers new perspectives in the theory of gaussian multiplicative chaos that we develop in section [ pers ]",
    ". therefore we will present our construction in a more general context than the only purpose of giving sense to the _ dual branch of gravity _ : we will not restrict ourselves to the @xmath69-dimensional case and we will not consider the only gff but , more generally , log - correlated gaussian distributions .",
    "in this section , we will briefly explain kahane s theory of multiplicative chaos in @xmath3 .",
    "in fact , kahane s theory is valid in any open domain @xmath70 with no substantial change . at the end of the section",
    ", we will also roughly recall the connection with measures formally given by the exponential of the gff .",
    "we consider a covariance kernel @xmath39 of @xmath71-positive type ( @xcite ) , namely that @xmath39 can be rewritten as a sum @xmath72 where @xmath73 is a sequence of continuous positive kernels of positive type .",

    "roughly speaking , ( [ gmc ] ) can be understood as a measure admitting as density the exponential of a gaussian distribution @xmath7 with covariance kernel @xmath90 .",
    "of course , this is purely formal because the exponential of a random distribution can not be directly defined .",
    "kahane proved that the martingale @xmath91 , for some borelian set @xmath62 with non - null finite lebesgue measure , is uniformly integrable if and only if @xmath13 , in which case it has no atoms .",
    "this condition @xmath13 is necessary and sufficient in order for the limiting measure @xmath88 to be non identically null .",
    "furthermore , he proved that the law of the limiting measure @xmath88 does not depend on the decomposition of @xmath39 into a sum of positive continuous kernels , hence founding an intrisic theory .",

    "they prove that one can construct the measure as the limit in law of measures where the underlying gaussian field has a covariance kernel obtained by a smooth cutoff of the logarithmic one ( their approach relies on convolutions of the covariance function rather than on the notion of @xmath71-positive type ( @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , they show that the law of the limit measure does not depend on the smoothing procedure one applies to the logarithmic kernel .",

    "after the two theories mentioned above ( gaussian multiplicative chaos and generalized gaussian multiplicative chaos ) , the authors of @xcite later suggested two other constructions of the liouville measure . the first construction , which falls under the scope of kahane s theory , consists in expanding the green function of the laplacian along an orthonormal basis of the sobolev space @xmath109 ( the space of functions whose gradient is in @xmath110 ) .",
    "all the results presented in this paper applies to this construction .",
    "the second construction consists in averaging the gff distribution along circles of size @xmath29 to get an @xmath29-regularized approximation of the gff . by the machinery developped in the generalized gaussian multiplicative chaos theory @xcite , it is straightforward to see that the measure converges in law to gaussian multiplicative chaos with the green function as covariance kernel ( in fact this is true for ball averages or any smooth cutoff procedure ) .",
    "the contribution of the authors in @xcite is to prove almost sure convergence along powers of 2 in the case of circle average approximations and to prove almost sure equality of the measures obtained via circle average/@xmath109-expansion approximations of the gff .",

    "in this section , we present a few simulations to understand more intuitively the structure of the dual chaos as introduced in section [ sec : kpz ] , i.e. @xmath13 , @xmath190 and @xmath191 .",

    "<S> this paper is concerned with the construction of atomic gaussian multiplicative chaos and the kpz formula in liouville quantum gravity . on the first hand , we construct purely atomic random measures corresponding to values of the parameter @xmath0 beyond the transition phase ( i.e. @xmath1 ) and check the duality relation with sub - critical gaussian multiplicative chaos . on the other hand , we give a simplified proof of the classical kpz formula as well as the dual kpz formula for atomic gaussian multiplicative chaos . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , this framework allows to construct singular liouville measures and to understand the duality relation in liouville quantum gravity . </S>"
