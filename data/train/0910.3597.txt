    "multiferroics ( mfs ) are materials in which different ferroic orders such as ferromagnetism , ferroelectricity and/or ferroelasticity may coexist in a single compound.@xcite they have attracted much attention for their potential applications in memory devices and other electronic components , due to the intriguing possibility of controlling magnetism by an applied electric field , and viceversa ( magnetoelectric effect).@xcite multiferroics are compounds where electron correlations are rather important , and where the electron charge shows atomic - like features , such as strong space localization , poorly dispersed band energies , and large on - site coulomb repulsion.@xcite for these systems , there are well - known deficiencies of local - spin - density approximation ( lsda ) or spin - polarized generalized - gradient - approximation ( sgga ) to density - functional - theory ( dft ) . among them , we recall the underestimation of the band - gap magnitude for most insulating materials.@xcite part of these failures can be traced back to the self - interaction error in approximate density functionals : the electron charge experiences a spurious interaction with the coulomb and exchange - correlation potential generated by itself.@xcite the lsda+@xmath4@xcite and the self - interaction correction ( sic ) schemes@xcite can overcome some of the deficiencies of lsda",
    ". however , lsda+@xmath4 suffers ambiguities in the choice of the @xmath4 parameter and needs a choice regarding which orbitals to treat within a hubbard - like approach . for simple materials , a self - consistent evaluation of the @xmath4 parameter can be obtained , although this method is not widely used.@xcite for bifeo@xmath0 , the value u@xmath5=3.8 ev has been recently calculated.@xcite    sic - schemes are not commonly available in electronic structure codes for extended solid state systems .",
    "the implementation of a fully self - consistent sic - lsda approach for extended systems was done by svane and co - workers.@xcite since then , other approaches have been implemented ( for a review , see refs.@xcite ) .",
    "sic - schemes suffer from the `` nonvariationality - problem '' of the energy functional which makes forces and stress calculation not commonly available.@xcite    in the last few years , hybrid hartree - fock density functionals@xcite have been widely used in solid state physics,@xcite ranging from simple semiconductor systems,@xcite to transition metals , lanthanides , actinides,@xcite molecules at surfaces,@xcite diluted magnetic semiconductors,@xcite carbon nanostructures.@xcite for a recent review see ref.@xcite .",
    "hybrid functionals mix the exact nonlocal exchange of hartree - fock theory@xcite with the density functional exchange .",
    "the heyd - scuseria - ernzerhof screened hybrid functional ( hse)@xcite is well suited for extended solid state systems .",
    "there are very few studies dealing with ferroelectric oxides and even less with multiferroics .",

    "_ extended the analysis to the prototypical multiferroic bismuth ferrite showing that hybrid - functionals , specifically the b1-wc functional , open new perspectives for a better first - principles description of multiferroics.@xcite in passing , we recall that the wc gradient corrected functional@xcite is very similar to pbesol and the hybrid b1-wc@xcite functional mixes the wc functional with 16% nonlocal exchange .",
    "the hybrid hse functional mixes 25% nonlocal exchange with the pbe functional and the mix is performed only on the short range component of the coulomb interaction ( for further details , we refer to ref .  ) . however ,",
    "which functional to prefer for simple ferroelectric compounds is still an open issue.@xcite    so far , a good performance of hse or b1-wc functionals has been recognized for _ proper _ multiferroics where the ferroelectric polarization is of displacive type . on the other hand , magnetically driven multiferroics ,",
    "also known as _ improper _ multiferroics , are largely unexplored using hybrid functionals .",
    "the purpose of this work is to extend the previous hybrid density functional studies from prototypical ferroelectric oxides ( srtio@xmath0 , batio@xmath0 , pbtio@xmath0)@xcite or simple multiferroic system ( bifeo@xmath0 ) to more complicated and exotic multiferroic compounds , such as homno@xmath0 .",
    "first of all , we focus on bifeo@xmath0 , already investigated using the b1-wc functional , but not yet using hse . in this way , we are able to compare two different , although similar , approaches for bifeo@xmath0 .",
    "most importantly , we consider another prototypical case of _ improper _ multiferroic , namely homno@xmath0 , which has recently attracted much attention.@xcite we will show that important differences compared to standard dft approaches arise when a proper description of correlated electrons , such as that given by hse , is taken into account .",

    "this means that if a pbe ( or pbe+u ) self - consistent calculation takes 10 minutes , the hse will take about 9 hours .",
    "] we always used the 400 ev and 6@xmath126@xmath126 * k*-point mesh .",
    "the fock exchange was sampled using the twofold reduced * k*-point grid ( using the full grid , gives however negligible changes in the computed properties ) .",

    "the paraelectric phase was simulated using 20-atoms cell in the afm - a spin configuration showing ferromagnetic ( fm ) ( afm ) intraplanar ( interplanar ) coupling ; for the ferroelectric one we used a 40-atoms cell ( doubling the previous cell along the @xmath25 axis ) in the afm - e spin configuration ( _ i.e. _ in - plane fm zigzag chains anti - ferromagnetically coupled to the neighboring chains with the interplanar coupling also afm ) .",
    "the energy cutoff was set to 300 ev and the brillouin zone mesh was fixed to 4@xmath122@xmath124 and 2@xmath122@xmath124 grid for the afm - a and afm - e phase respectively .",

    ", we used the same simulation cell containing 40 atoms for both phases , increasing the cutoff to 400 ev and using a 4@xmath122@xmath124 * k*-point grid .",
    "the ferroelectric structure is represented by a distorted double perovskite structure with @xmath13 symmetry ( n. 161 , point group c@xmath27 ) as reported by kubel and schmid.@xcite the paraelectric phase has @xmath28 symmetry ( n. 167 , point group d@xmath29 ) .",
    "both phases are shown in fig.[bfo.1 ] . in table",
    "[ tab1 ] we report relevant properties such as the structural parameters , the fe magnetic moment and the energy gap calculated using the pbe and hse functionals .",
    "we also report the values using the b1-wc functional taken from ref.@xcite    first of all , hse reduces the lattice parameter @xmath30 with respect to pbe , giving a much better agreement with the experimental value : the error decreases from @xmath21 % ( pbe ) to @xmath20.3 % ( hse ) . as a consequence",
    ", the unit cell volume @xmath31 also shrinks , getting closer to the experimental value .",
    "the rhombohedral angle , @xmath32 , is almost insensitive to the applied functional .",
    "thus , the inclusion of fock exchange makes the structure more compact , _",
    "i.e. _ the lattice constant decreases .",
    "note that the b1-wc functional gives too small lattice constant and too small equilibrium volume as compared to hse , worsening the comparison with the experiments .",

    "[ tab1 ] , we see that the theoretical nns distances compare well with experiments , with errors from @xmath2 1 % to @xmath24 % ( pbe ) , from @xmath2 3 % to @xmath2 5 % ( b1-wc ) and @xmath2 2 % ( hse )",
    ". the o-@xmath40-o bond angle would be 180@xmath41 in the ideal cubic perovskite . in this system",
    ", it buckles to an experimental value of 165.03@xmath41 .",
    "the hse value ( 164.56@xmath41 ) is close to pbe , and in both cases , they are slightly underestimated with respect to experiment . the b1-wc angle , on the other hand",
    ", is clearly underestimated .",
    "overall , the predicted hse values clearly are in much better agreement with experiments than those calculated using the pbe or b1-wc functional .",
    "let us consider now the magnetic and electronic properties .",
    "as shown in table  [ tab1 ] , the calculated local moments are generally very similar for all the functionals , and close to the experimental value . in particular , the hse local moment is slightly larger than pbe , suggesting a more localized picture of the spin - polarized electrons .",
    "the calculated pbe ( hse ) electronic energy gap is 1.0 ( 3.4 ) ev .",
    "the expected band - gap opening using hybrid functionals can be understood as follows : the exact exchange acts on occupied states only , correcting them for the self - interaction , thus shifting downwards the occupied valence bands . in turn , this has a clear interpretation : within the hartree - fock approximation for the ground state of an n electron system , the potential felt by each of the n electrons in the ground state is that due to n-1 other electrons , _",
    "i.e. _ they feel a more attractive ionic potential . on the other hand , for unoccupied states",
    ", the potential is that due to the n occupied orbitals , so these orbitals effectively experience a potential from one more electron , the latter screens the ionic potential which in turn becomes less attractive .",
    "therefore , the unoccupied states are shifted upwards , opening the gap . as for the experimental energy gap for bifeo@xmath0 ,",
    "the situation is not clear .",
    "there have been several measurements of the band gap using uv - visible absorption spectroscopy and ellipsometry on polycrystalline bfo films , epitaxial bfo films grown by pulsed - laser deposition , nanowires , nanotubes , and bulk single crystals .",
    "reported band - gap values vary from 2.5 to 2.8 ev.@xcite an estimate gives @xmath2 2.5 ev from the optical absorption spectra by kanai _ _ et al.__@xcite and gao _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite . from the theoretical side",
    ", there is a spread of values : a small gap of 0.30 - 0.77 ev using lsda,@xcite or from 0.3 to 1.9 ev using `` lda+u '' , depending on the value of u@xcite ; 0.8 - 1.0 ev using pbe ( wc ) gga functional;@xcite 3.0 - 3.6 ev using b1-wc and b3lyp hybrid functionals.@xcite thus , a parameter - free theoretical reference value is clearly needed .",
    "the most accurate ( but expensive ) method is the gw approximation.@xcite here , we provide for the first time , the value of the bfo energy gap based on the gw method .",
    "first of all , at the pbe level , we estimate an energy gap of 1.0 ev . when introducing the exact exchange ( hse ) , the gap opens up to e@xmath42=3.4 ev . upon inclusion of many - body effects ( g@xmath22w@xmath22 ) , it opens even more ( e@xmath42=3.8 ev ) . finally , when including vertex corrections , we find that the gap reduces to 3.3 ev .",
    "remarkably , vertex corrections almost confirm the hse band gap .",
    "this is perfectly in line with recent works@xcite where it is argued that hse band gaps represent a very accurate estimate due to partial inclusion of the derivative discontinuity of the exchange - correlation functional.@xcite clearly , effects beyond bare dft are important in this compound .",
    "our results show that hybrid - functional calculations give already a very good estimate at a lower computational cost compared to gw . in this respect",
    ", we mention the very recent experimental study based on resonant soft x - ray emission spectroscopy@xcite where the band gap corresponding to the energy separation between the top of the o @xmath43 valence band and the bottom of the fe @xmath44 conduction band is 1.3 ev .",
    "the discrepancy between theory and experiment may be due to the presence of defects in the experimental sample as well as to the resolution involved in photoemission spectra .",
    "we hope to stimulate further experimental work to test our first - principles prediction of the energy gap of this important multiferroic material .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we show the density of states ( dos ) for the optimized atomic structure .",
    "let s focus on the pbe dos .",
    "the lowest states at @xmath2 @xmath45 10 ev are bi @xmath37 hybridized with o @xmath46 states ( blue curve ) .",
    "above @xmath45 6 ev there are hybridized o @xmath46 and fe @xmath44 states .",
    "the fe @xmath44 states extend in the conduction band as well ; the bi @xmath46 states can be found above 4 ev . as for the hse dos",
    ", we see that the conduction bands are shifted upwards , opening the valence - conduction gap .",
    "there is a change in the spectral distribution above @xmath45 8 ev : a valley appears around @xmath45 6 ev and the lower shoulder of the peak increases its spectral weight .",
    "it is easy to trace back the above changes to modifications of the majority fe @xmath44 states , as shown in the panel beneath : while in pbe the band states in the vicinity of the top of the valence band have predominantly @xmath44 character , in hse the spectral weight of the fe @xmath44 states is concentrated far away from the top of the valence band .",
    "this can be interpreted as a change from a more itinerant picture to a more localized description of the fe @xmath44 states going from pbe to hse . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we also include the spectral distribution of the fe @xmath44 states derived from a recent experimental work@xcite ( see dotted lines ) : the position of the main hse fe @xmath44 peak almost perfectly matches the experimental pdos , although the bandwidth of the calculated dos is different because of energy resolution , etc . indeed , if we include the fe @xmath44 dos calculated using g@xmath22w@xmath47 vertex corrections , the agreement between the theoretical and experimental peak position becomes excellent .",
    "note that the hse and g@xmath22w@xmath47vertex peak position are very close to each other , confirming the accurate hse description of the bifeo@xmath0 electronic structure .",
    "in passing we note that while dft+@xmath4 gives a better estimate of the fe @xmath44 peak position,@xcite the energy gap is still underestimated with respect our gw calculation .",
    "we previously mentioned that hse may change the ionic / covalent character in this compound . to support this , in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show the difference between the pbe and hse charge density , @xmath48 calculated at fixed geometry .",
    "in a purely ionic description , all the valence electrons would be located on the oxygens , acting as `` electron sinks '' , and the cations would donate their nominal valence charge . the more the electrons populate the anions , or conversely , the more the electrons depopulate the cations , the more the picture shows an ionic character .",
    "[ fig2 ] confirms the trend discussed before : upon adding a fraction of exact exchange to the pbe functional , the electronic charge at the cations decreases , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath49 is positive ( grey areas in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , while the electronic charge at the anions increases _ i.e. _ @xmath49 is negative ( yellow areas in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "thus , the introduction of exact - exchange generates a flux of charge from the cations towards the anions , clearly shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , increasing the ionicity of the compound .",
    "in order to discuss more quantitatively these effects , we perform a bader analysis of the electronic charge.@xcite the atom in molecules ( aim ) theory is a well established analysis tool for studying the topology of the electron density and suitable for discussing the ionic / covalent character of a compound .",
    "the charge ( @xmath50 ) enclosed within the bader ( @xmath51 ) volume is a good approximation to the total electronic charge of an atom . in table",
    "[ bader ] we report @xmath50 and @xmath51 calculated for bi , fe , and o at a fixed geometric structure , _",
    "i.e. _ hse geometry .",
    "this is needed in order to avoid different volumes for the normalization of the charge in the unit cell and for highlighting the electronic structure modifications due to the exact exchange .",
    "furthermore , we consider only the valence charge for our analysis ( although one should formally include also the core charge , we do not expect variations as far as the trends are concerned ) .",
    "let us first consider the cations : the bader charge and volume are larger in pbe than in hse . for the anions , the opposite holds true .",
    "this is not unexpected and in agreement with intuition : upon introducing fock exchange , the system evolves towards a more ionic picture , through a flux of charge from cations towards anions , which reduces ( increases ) the `` size '' of the cations ( anions ) when going from the pbe to the hse solution .",
    "finally , we note that a different degree of ionicity modifies the calculated equilibrium lattice parameter : in a partially covalent material , such as bifeo@xmath0,@xcite the increased ionicity changes the different net charges generating a higher madelung field , which is an important contribution to the bonding in the solid , and contracts the equilibrium structure.@xcite      let s finally focus on the electric polarization . in table",
    "[ tab4 ] , we report the ionic and electronic contributions to the difference of ferroelectric polarization between the polar ( @xmath13 ) and non - polar ( @xmath28 ) both in pbe and hse . in order to disentangle the purely electronic effects from the ionic ones upon introduction of fock exchange , we report",
    "also the pbe(hse ) electronic contribution calculated at fixed hse(pbe ) geometry . as a general comment",
    ", we note that a large polarization of @xmath2 100 @xmath52 along ( 111 ) for bulk bfo has been reported experimentally by new measurements on high - quality single crystals.@xcite in good agreement with our calculated values . in what follows",
    ", we will mainly focus on the differences between pbe and hse calculations .",
    "note that the unit cell volume is different for pbe and hse , as shown in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "first , we note that the polarization calculated according to the point charge model ( p@xmath53 ) is closer to p@xmath54 at the hse than at the pbe level .",
    "this confirms that the hse description of bfo points towards an ionic picture , _",
    "i.e. _ by decreasing the covalency effects .",
    "the calculated total polarization p@xmath54 is @xmath2 105 @xmath55 using pbe and @xmath2 110 @xmath55 using hse , _",
    "i.e. _ hse predicts an increase of _ total _ electric polarization .",
    "the occurrence of ferroelectricity in bifeo@xmath0 is usually discussed in terms of `` polarizable lone pair '' carried by the bismuth atom .",
    "this has a physical interpretation in terms of cross gap hybridization between occupied o @xmath43 states and unoccupied bi @xmath56 states.@xcite .",
    "intuitively , the larger the energy gap , the lower the polarization should be .",
    "accordingly , one might expect hse to reduce the polarization compared to pbe because of the larger energy gap .",
    "we will show below that this is not in contraddiction with the results of table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "in fact , let s consider p@xmath54 calculated at the _ same _ atomic structure ( for example at the pbe relaxed structure of the paraelectric and ferroelectric phases ) but using both pbe and hse .",
    "we denote the former as p@xmath57 , the latter as p@xmath58 .",
    "note that the ionic contributions is of course the same for both cases . from table",
    "[ tab1 ] , we have p@xmath57=105.6 @xmath55 and p@xmath58=103.2 @xmath55 , _ i.e. _ a decrease of total polarization is found in going from pbe to hse for the same ionic structure . a similar behavior is found in opposite conditions : for the hse ionic structure , p@xmath59=110.3 @xmath55 and p@xmath60=112.6 @xmath55 .",
    "thus , keeping the same volume and including fock exchange , the polarization reduces as expected . on the other hand ,",
    "when we evaluate the _ total _ polarization at the appropriate equilibrium and relaxed structures using pbe and hse , the ionic contribution also varies and one loses a direct connection between the increase of the energy gap and the decrease of total polarization . in our case , the total polarization ,",
    "when evaluated at the appropriate equilibrium volume for each functional , increases from pbe to hse .",
    "this clearly points out a strong volume - dependence of the polarization , therefore calling for a correct estimate of the volume ( as provided by hse ) .",
    "an extended review of the main properties of orthorhombic homno@xmath0 within a standard pbe approach can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite where it is also shown that the inclusion of the @xmath4 correction worsens the structural properties .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we will focus on the comparison between the predictions of hse with respect to pbe results . in fig .",
    "[ hmo ] we show the perspective view of homno@xmath0 and the paraelectric ( afm - a ) and ferroelectric ( afm - e ) spin configurations in the @xmath61 plane .    in table  [ tab.afma ] we report the optimized structural parameters in the afm - a magnetic configuration , calculated using pbe and hse .",
    "the in - plane short ( @xmath37 ) and long ( @xmath39 ) mn - oxygen bond - lengths get closer to experimental values using hse ; on the other hand , the out - of - plane length is slightly overestimated with respect to the pbe and the experimental value . in order to quantify structural distortions , the jahn - teller ( jt ) distortion vector @xmath62=[\\sqrt{l - s},\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}(2m - l - s)]$ ]",
    "is often introduced . from table",
    "[ tab.afma ] , it is thus clear that the hse functional improves the jt distortion upon the pbe description : the magnitude of @xmath63 is q=0.55   and 0.61   using pbe and hse , respectively , whereas the experimental value is 0.59  .",
    "as far as the structural angles are concerned , we first notice that the gdfeo@xmath0-like tilting ( @xmath64 ) in the mn - o@xmath35 octahedron is slightly overestimated using the hybrid functional : the deviation from the experimental angle is 3.7 ( pbe ) and 5.0 % ( hse ) with the mn - o - mn in - plane angles calculated using hse slightly reduced with respect to pbe .",
    "we note , however , that the experimental uncertainty on the angles may be up to @xmath2 1@xmath41 , @xcite due to synthesis problems of ortho - homno@xmath0 .",
    "@xcite the octahedral tilting is related to the ionic size of the rare - earth ion:@xcite the tilting increases when the radius of the rare - earth atom decreases ( for example , from la to lu in the manganites series).@xcite in this respect , the tendency towards a larger octahedral tilting , upon inclusion of exact - exchange - functional , goes hand in hand with the reduced ionic size of ho ion when going from pbe to hse . as in the previous case , we performed a bader analysis of the valence charge distribution .",
    "results are shown in table  [ bader ] : as expected , the  size  of the ho ion is reduced within hse . according to our previous discussion ,",

    "the comparison between the pbe and hse band structure highlights some differences .",
    "first we note that the oxygen bands are slightly shifted to lower binding energy together with the mn @xmath67,@xmath68 bands . on the other hand , the average position of occupied mn @xmath71 , @xmath70 bands remain almost unchanged , but the band - width increases .",
    "the latter effect is mainly shown by the lowest of the two bands , _",
    "i.e. _ the @xmath67-like band .",
    "as well known,@xcite hartree - fock hamiltonians naturally leads to larger band - width and down - shift of electronic states , even for simple homogeneous systems .",
    "thus , the larger band - widths obtained by hse can not be simply connected to a stronger hybridization , because it is an intrinsic feature of fock exchange for every electronic state .",
    "indeed , we will show below that the @xmath80 hybridization is expected to decrease using hse .",
    "@xmath76 is evaluated as 3.4 ev , larger than in the pbe case , suggesting a stronger local distortion related to the jahn - teller instability .",
    "the increase of the jt splitting is linked to the increase of the energy gap as well , which is now @xmath2 2.7 ev .",
    "the exchange splitting , @xmath79=4.6 ev , is also larger along with an increased local mn moments with respect to pbe .",
    "note , that the enhancement of jahn - teller distortion by hse is not unexpected .",
    "in fact , it was previously suggested that the hse functional is able to reveal the jahn - teller effect for mn@xmath81 through a _ symmetry broken solution _ giving rise to an orbitally ordered state and consequent jahn - teller distortion.@xcite the larger @xmath76 is mainly driven by a purely electronic effect due to the inclusion of fock - exchange .",
    "infact , by calculating the pbe self - consistent charge density on top of the hse ionic structure , @xmath76 becomes @xmath2 1.2 ev , _",
    "i.e. _ nearly equal to the previous pbe case .",
    "thus , we expect hse to cause a rearrangement of the charge density that will _ reduce _ the electronic contribution to the electronic polarization when considering the polar phase .",
    "this can be understood as follows .",
    "the increase of the jahn - teller splitting goes hand in hand with the increase of the energy gap : the larger the gap , the smaller the dielectric constant is , _",
    "i.e. _ the smaller the screening is .",
    "now , let us consider the fixed ionic configuration of the paraelectric phase : the charge in the non - centrosymmetric _ spin arrangement _ can be thought as a `` small '' perturbation of the centrosymmetric one upon the application of the `` internal '' electric field .",
    "the electronic charge will respond to such a field , and each electronic state will change assuming a polarized configuration . if the gap is large , the `` electric field '' will hardly mix the electronic states in the valence band with the electronic states in the conduction band , since in second order perturbation theory approach the denominator will be of order of the band gap energy , so that the electrons do nt polarize much , _",
    "i.e. _ the charge distribution becomes more `` rigid '' . in conclusion , we expect the electronic contribution to the electric polarization to decrease upon introduction of fock exchange .",
    "this will be confirmed by our calculations .",
    "note that the above reasoning is not appropriate for bfo where the polarization is mainly due to ionic displacements .",
    "let us focus on the afm - e phase , where the resulting symmetry is lowered by the spin configuration with respect to the afm - a spin arrangements by removing the inversion symmetry . in fig .",
    "[ chain ] , we show the relevant structural internal parameters , for the relaxed pbe and hse structure , by considering the mn - o - mn - o - mn chain ( compare fig .  [ chain ] and fig .  [ hmo ] ) .",
    "the mn - o @xmath82 bond - lengths do not show significant differences between the parallel and antiparallel spin configuration in pbe as well in hse .",
    "on the other hand , the long mn - o bond lengths are mostly affected : their difference , @xmath83 - @xmath84 in pbe is about 0.07   and decreases to @xmath2 0.02   upon introduction of exact exchange . at the same time",
    ", the angle changes : @xmath85 decreases while @xmath86 remains almost equal to the pbe value .",
    "the results can be interpreted as follows : bare pbe is expected to overestimate hybridization effects between oxygen @xmath46-states and mn @xmath44-states , therefore inducing a stronger rearrangement of ionic positions consistent with a ",
    "softer \" structure when moving from , say a centrosymmetric a - type to a ferroelectric e - type phase .",
    "viceversa , upon introduction of correlation effects , the reduced hybridization is expected to lead to a more  rigid \" ionic arrangement .",
    "indeed , this is evident when comparing the difference between @xmath85 - @xmath86 , which drastically reduces upon introduction of hse with respect to pbe .",
    "we recall that , ultimately , it is this difference that gives rise to the ionic polarization , as clearly shown in fig . 2 b ) of ref.@xcite .",
    "we can therefore anticipate that a reduction of the polarization will occur upon introduction of hse , as discussed in detail below . what is worthwhile noting is that the mn - mn distances in pbe dramatically depends on their having parallel ( @xmath87 = 3.98  ) or antiparallel spins ( @xmath88 = 3.87  ) , so that @xmath89 = 0.11  . however , this dependence is smoothed upon introduction of hse , so that the difference in mn - mn distance strongly reduces to @xmath89 = 0.03  .",
    "in general , the marked ( weak ) dependence of the structural properties within pbe ( hse ) is consistent with a strong ( small ) efficiency of the double  exchange mechanism , which ultimately relies on the @xmath90 hybridization and hopping integral .",
    "the band - structure of the afm - e is quite similar to the a - type and is therefore not shown .",
    "however , there are some small differences which we comment on . as expected , the increase of the number of the afm bonds of each mn with its four neighbors associated with the change of the magnetic state going from afm - a to afm - e type results in a narrowing of all bands .",
    "this is further enhanced by hse due to the reduced hopping upon introduction of exact exchange , as expected .",
    "furthermore , the increase of the band gap is facilitated by the interplay of the crystal distortion , which is generally enhanced by hse , with the afm arrangement of spins .",
    "as expected , the energy gap is the largest in the afm - e - hse band structure , being now @xmath2 3 ev .",
    "the @xmath76 evaluated at @xmath73 point , is also the largest in this case , being @xmath2 3.7 ev . before turning our attention to the electronic polarization , we discuss the magnetic properties .",
    "first of all , we found that the afm - e is more stable than the afm - a by @xmath2 4 mev / cell in the hse formalism .",
    "note that this value has been obtained using the same simulation cell for both phases , therefore reducing the influence of numerical errors .",
    "although the relative stability is still comparable with the numerical accuracy , it is indeed consistent with experiments.@xcite in afm - e - pbe , the mn moment is 3.4 @xmath91 which induces a small spin - polarization on the oxygen equal to @xmath92 0.04 @xmath91 . in afm - e - hse",
    ", the mn moment slightly increases to 3.7 @xmath91 and the oxygen moment slightly decreases to @xmath92 0.01 @xmath91 : the increased localization of the mn @xmath44 states correlates with the increased manganese spin moment and goes hand by hand with the decreased @xmath46-@xmath44 hybridization and a decreased induced spin moment on oxygens .      finally , we calculated the ferroelectric polarization by considering the afm - a as the reference paraelectric structure .",
    "the results show that the polarization ( both the electronic and ionic terms ) strongly reduces upon introduction of hse .",
    "however , it is remarkable that the total p is still of the order of 2 @xmath55 : this confirms homno@xmath1 as the magnetically - induced ferroelectric having the highest polarization predicted so far .",
    "our estimate is in very good agreement with model hamiltonian calculations.@xcite the comparison between theory and experiments as far as the electric polarization is concerned is still a matter of debate . whereas earlier studies predicted negligible values for polycrystalline homno@xmath0 samples,@xcite more recent studies for tmmno@xmath0 in the e - type ( where the exchange - striction mechanism is exactly the same as in homno@xmath0 ) point to a polarization which could exceed 1 @xmath55,@xcite in excellent agreement with our predicted hse value .",
    "the reasons why we expect a reduction upon introduction of hse have been already discussed in previous paragraphs and can be traced back to the reduced @xmath90 hybridization . as in the case of bfo , we disentangle the structural and electronic effects , by using the hse ( pbe ) geometry with the pbe ( hse ) functional ( cfr .",
    "table  [ tab4 ] ) .",
    "what we infer from these  ad - hoc \"- built systems is that the use of hse dramatically reduces the electronic contribution ( cfr @xmath93 in pbe and hse(pbe ) ) , _ i.e. _ reduced by @xmath2 2.5 @xmath55 . less important",
    ", though still appreciable , seem to be the ionic displacements : their dipole moment is reduced by @xmath2 1.5 @xmath55 when comparing @xmath94 in hse and hse(pbe ) .",
    "this is consistent with what shown approximately by p@xmath53 .",
    "in this work , we have revised the two workhorse materials of the exponentially growing field of multiferroics , namely bifeo@xmath0 for proper mfs and homno@xmath0 for improper mfs by using the screened hybrid functional ( hse ) .    from our study ,",
    "several important points emerge . for bfo :",
    "i ) the structural , electronic and magnetic properties well agree with experiments ; ii ) the ferroelectric polarization agrees with reported values in the literature ; iii ) even if pbe allows the description of ferroelectric properties by opening an energy gap , it is by no means satisfactory in correctly describing all the properties on the same footing . on the other hand , hse improves the pbe and lda+@xmath4 description ; this is clearly shown by benchmark calculations using the most advanced and accurate state - of - the art gw+vertex corrections ( which basically confirm the hse results ) ; iv ) the previous comment , and very recent studies@xcite suggests that optical properties , so far not investigated at all by ab ",
    "initio calculations for bfo , can be properly addressed within hse .",
    "v ) finally , we note that the electronic polarization _",
    "increases _ upon introduction of exact exchange . for hmo ,",
    "we note that : i ) the hse results are in good agreement with experiments when available ; ii ) the jahn - teller effect is correctly described in agreement with experiment ; iii ) despite a reduction of the polarization value with respect to pbe , homno@xmath0 still shows the highest @xmath95 predicted among magnetically - induced ferroelectrics .",
    "we have shown that introduction of  correlation  effects may both enhance the polarization or reduce it : the former effect will most likely occur for proper mfs , and the latter for improper mfs , _",
    "e.g. _ magnetically driven .",
    "note that an increase of hse polarization with respect to lda , for example , is also found by wahl _ _ et al.__@xcite for batio@xmath0 , a standard ferroelectric compound . also for bifeo@xmath0 ,",
    "an increase of polarization using dft+@xmath4 has been noticed.@xcite the increase of ferroelectric polarization when including a fraction of exact exchange and using the theoretical equilibrium volume has been reported also for simple ferrolectric compound such as knbo@xmath0.@xcite    one final comment is in order : although the hse results certainly point towards a truly realistic description , it is still possible that , to some extent , the good performances of hse may be material - dependent , _",
    "i.e. _ the universal 1/4 fraction of the exact exchange may be not appropriate for some specific material .",
    "what is certainly true is that the predictive capability of hse , combined with its nowadays affordable computational costs , make the functional an attractive choice for the study of a wide range of materials , from well - behaved insulators to doped semiconductors exhibiting magnetic ordering , multifunctional complex oxides of interest for many industrial applications therefore representing a very good starting point for materials design .",
