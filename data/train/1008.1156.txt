    "the early thermalization of this matter leading to the formation of a quark - gluon plasma is one of the largest unexplained puzzles in rhic physics .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations are consistent with a thermalization time of 1.5 fm / c or less @xcite .",
    "it is generally believed that the instability and consequent exponential growth of intense gluon fields would be the origin of early thermalization .",
    "various plasma instabilities such as the weibel instability  @xcite and the nielsen - olesen instability  @xcite can cause the exponential growth of the amplitude of unstable modes of the su(3 ) gauge field . the plasma instability may be characterized by the negative curvature of the potential , leading to the equation of motion @xmath0 where @xmath1 denotes the field variable in the unstable mode .",
    "the energy stored in the intense gauge field eventually produces abundant particles and evolves towards a thermalized state .",
    "the thermalization mechanism governing this transition is not yet clear , and the time scale on which it occurs is not known .",
    "the equilibration problem is simplified , however , by the high occupation probability of the unstable modes , which makes a quasi - classical treatment of the thermalization process , at least of its initial stages , possible .    in the classical dynamics ,",
    "the apparent entropy of an isolated system is produced by the increasing complexity in phase space .",

    "the production of entropy at the quantum level poses additional problems such as the decoherence of the quantum state of the system  @xcite , since the evolution in pure state generates no entropy and some kind of coarse graining is necessary .",
    "kunihiro , mller , ohnishi , and schfer @xcite ( henceforth referred to as kmos ) proposed to apply the husimi function , a smeared wigner function with minimal wave packets , to define a minimally coarse grained entropy , the wehrl entropy , and showed that it grows at the rate of the ks entropy in the classical long - time limit , i.e. if the system has enough time to sample the complete phase space . in that paper application",

    "specifically , we analyze the exponentially growing behavior of the distances between the trajectories .",
    "we find that we have to distinguish different regimes , depending on sampling time , namely a kinetic stage for short sampling times , an intermediate- and a long - time regiem.in each case we consider the exponential growth rate of the distance between two trajectories , which follows the equation of motion , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the so - called hesse matrix or _",

    "we will refer to the eigenvalues of the time - evolution matrix as _ intermediate lyapunov exponents _ ( ile ) .    because the iles describe the evolution of the strongly excited yang - mills field modes during the time when the field configuration is still far away from equilibrium and a quasi - classical description of the dynamics of the yang - mills field is appropriate , the iles are the most relevant lyapunov exponents for the early thermalization at rhic .",
    "below we obtain the distribution of these three kinds of lyapunov exponents . since they govern the growth rate of the coarse grained entropy residing in the yang - mills field , they will allow us to estimate the equilibration time as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the increase of entropy necessary for equilibration .",
    "since classical cym theory has no conformal anomaly ( it does not know about @xmath10 ) all statistical quantities should scale like @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the energy density and @xmath13 is the mass dimension of that quantity . for example , the ks entropy has the mass dimension and scales as @xmath14 .    for the initial stage of high energy heavy ion collisions",
    "the relevant scale is the saturation scale @xmath15 , which is related to the initial energy density in the color glass condensate ( cgc ) model as @xmath16 , implying that the time scale of very early dynamics is given by @xmath17 . + not surprisingly , fries , mller and schfer have indeed found that decoherence ( which is probably the fastest mechanism for entropy production ) happens indeed on this time scale  @xcite .",

    "next we show the long - time evolution in terms of the maximum lyapunov exponent .",
    "in this section , following a brief review of previous results , we discuss the method we use to analyze the complexity evolution in the classical yang - mills theory for an intermediate time duration .",
    "we first introduce the intermediate lyapunov exponent which is applicable to general cases , and apply it to the classical yang - mills evolution .    the chaotic properties of the classical evolution of yang - mills fields has been known and studied for a long time @xcite .",
    "chaos was first observed in the infrared limit of the yang - mills theory @xcite ; later it was shown to exist also in the compact lattice version of the classical yang - mills theory @xcite .",
    "the maximal global lyapunov exponent may be related to the plasmon damping rate of the thermal pure yang - mills plasma @xcite .",
    "the global ks entropy of the compact lattice gauge theory ( i.e. the rate of entropy growth close to thermal equilibrium ) was shown to be extensive , i.e.  proportional to the lattice volume @xcite , and the ergodic properties of the compact su(2 ) lattice gauge theory were investigated numerically in detail by bolte _",

    "since we are here not interested in the ergodic properties of the classical nonabelian gauge theory , but in its dynamical properties far off equilibrium , we will mostly make use of the non - compact formulation of the lattice gauge theory . in the following ,",
    "we set the stage for our investigation by discussing three different kinds of instability exponents , which capture different aspects of the dynamics of a nonlinear system with many degrees of freedom , such as the classical yang - mills field .      for a simple `` roll - over '' transition , @xmath20",
    ", we have one positive and one negative lyapunov exponents , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , which characterize both , the kinetic instability and the entropy production .",

    "the equations of motion for the tangent vector @xmath24 are written as , @xmath25 where we have introduced short - hand notations , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and so on .",
    "for an inverted harmonic oscillator , we put @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and find , @xmath30 this leads to an exponential expansion in the direction of @xmath31 and an exponential contraction in the direction of @xmath32 .",
    "the entropy production rate in this simple case was analyzed by kmos , who found to be given by @xmath33 for @xmath34 .    in the case of many degrees of freedom ,",
    "a similar structure will appear as @xmath35 now the second derivatives should be regarded as matrices , e.g. @xmath36 .",
    "we will refer to the matrix of second derivatives , @xmath6 , as the hessian in this paper .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath37 of @xmath38 are referred to as the local lyapunov exponents ( lle ) .",
    "the lle plays the role of a `` temporally local '' lyapunov exponent , which specifies the departure of two trajectories in a short time period .",
    "if @xmath38 is constant , i.e.  in the absence of mode coupling , the lles are identical with the lyapunov exponents , and the ks entropy is defined as the sum of positive lles . in general , however , for a system with many degrees of freedom , stable and unstable modes couple with each other .",
    "thus , the lle does not generally agree with the lyapunov exponent in a long time period . in order to discuss the exponentially growing behavior of the fluctuation ,",
    "we introduce the intermediate lyapunov exponent ( ile ) .",

    "we diagonalize the time evolution matrix @xmath42 and define the iles as , @xmath45 liouville s theorem dictates that the determinant of the time evolution matrix @xmath42 is unity , and thus the sum of all positive and negative iles is zero . after a long enough time for thermalization , the distribution of the iles is expected to converge to that of the global lyapunov exponents ( gle ) : @xmath46    in general all three types of lyapunov exponents , lle , ile , and gle , yield different results .",
    "here we are interested in the rapid growth of the coarse grained entropy when the gauge field configuration is still far from equilibrium , but has already had sufficient time to sample a significant fraction of phase space .",
    "our goal is not to calculate how the entropy grows when a configuration close to equilibrium relaxes further ; this can be calculated reliably in thermal quantum field theory .",
    "instead , we focus below on the iles , and estimate the ks entropy as @xmath47      we consider the pure yang - mills theory in the temporal gauge , which permits a hamiltonian formulation .",

    "in the course of these investigations it was crucial to understand the qualitative differences between the different time ranges and corresponding lyapunov spectra , which also allows to reconcile previously not understood observations @xcite .",

    "<S> understanding the underlying mechanisms causing rapid thermalization deduced for high - energy heavy ion collissons is still a challenge . to estimate the thermalization time , entropy growth for classical yang - mills theories is studied , based on the determination of lyapunov exponents . </S>",
    "<S> distinct regimes for short , medium and long sampling times are characterized by different properties of their spectrum of lyapunov exponents . </S>",
    "<S> clarifying the existence of these regimes and their implications for gauge - field dynamics is one of the results of this contribution . as a phenomenological application </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that for pure gauge theories with random initial conditions thermalization occures within few fm / c , an estimate which can be reduced by the inclusion of fermions , specific initial conditions etc . </S>"
