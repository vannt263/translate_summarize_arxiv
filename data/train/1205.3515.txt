    "for many production processes at colliders and other particle physics observables , the inclusion of higher - order radiative corrections is essential to match the experimental precision .",
    "much progress towards efficient calculational techniques has been made over the last decades by many authors .",
    "however , the computation of loop diagrams with many different mass scales , many external legs , or more than one loop remains a difficult task .",
    "in particular , when going beyond the one - loop level , it is known that the loop integrals can in general not be solved analytically .",
    "nevertheless , by using specialized semi - numerical techniques , several complete two - loop calculations have been carried out , for example for electroweak precision observables @xcite and qcd corrections to the production of gauge bosons @xcite , top quarks @xcite or higgs bosons @xcite at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "however , the methods employed in these papers have been tailored to the problem at hand and can not be applied easily to other situations .",
    "fully numerical techniques offer an alternative and potentially more flexible approach towards complex loop calculations . for a purely numerical method to become viable ,",
    "two main obstacles need to be overcome : extracting the ultraviolet ( uv ) and infrared and collinear ( ir ) singularities from the integral ; and ensuring robust and efficient convergence of the numerical integration .",
    "several powerful methods have been proposed :    * _ sector decomposition",
    "_ starts from the feynman parametrization of a loop diagram .",
    "it isolates the physical singularities through appropriate mappings of the integration region @xcite .",
    "there are additional integrable singularities inside the integration region for a diagram with physical cuts . while being formally integrable , such singularities",
    "can not be handled by standard numerical integration algorithms . to avoid the problem and improve numerical stability one can deform the integration contours in the complex plane @xcite .",
    "* the feynman integrals can be transformed into _ mellin - barnes representations_. an algorithm for the extraction of uv and ir poles has been developed based the residue theorem @xcite .",
    "again , the presence of physical cuts leads to bad convergence behavior of the numerical integrals , which can be improved by variable mapping and contour deformations @xcite . * in a third approach the uv and ir singularities are removed from the integrand by suitable _ _ s__ubtraction terms @xcite .",
    "these subtraction terms are designed such that they can be easily integrated analytically and added back to the final result . as for the previous two methods , integrable singularities due to physical thresholds",
    "may be treated with the help of contour deformations @xcite .",
    "the method based on subtraction terms has so far been applied only to one - loop calculations .",
    "this article presents a procedure for extending this idea to two - loop integrals . for this purpose",
    "the ir subtraction terms are constructed in analogy to ref .",
    "@xcite and combined with the contour deformation prescription of ref .  @xcite .",
    "in addition , a new treatment for the uv divergences is introduced . as a first step",
    ", it is shown that this approach is already useful at the one - loop level , leading to numerical integrals with good convergence behavior .",
    "secondly , it is demonstrated how it can be applied to two - loop diagrams . in the present paper , only two - loop integrals with ir singularities in one of the subloops",
    "are considered .",
    "the extension to overlapping ir singularities in both subloops will be delegated to a forthcoming publication @xcite , but it is relatively straightforward since most of the required subtraction terms can be constructed from the results of ref .",

    "a public computer code for the evaluation of arbitrary one - loop integrals is provided , based on the method presented here .",
    "it is planned to incorporate two - loop cases into future versions of this code .    in the next section , the method for the numerical evaluation of one - loop integrals , using subtraction terms and contour deformation , is explained .",
    "it is demonstrated how it can be cast into an algorithmic form and its application in several examples is demonstrated . in section  [ sc:2 ]",
