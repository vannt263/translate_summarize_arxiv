    "they both show a systematic offset between the average halo bias over @xmath65@xmath63 ( dashed lines ) and that over the bao peak ( roughly @xmath66@xmath67 ) for all the four mass ranges .",
    "the decrement of the bias below the transition scale depends on the halo mass : 4% for @xmath36 and roughly 2% for @xmath37 .",
    "this finding is relevant to bao measurements from luminous red galaxies , which are mostly central galaxies in halos of masses from a few times @xmath19 to @xmath68 @xcite .    to see whether it is a coincidence that the bias drops near the trough of the bao signal , we contrast the results from the bao simulations ( circles ) with those from the no - bao simulations ( boxes ) in figure  [ fig : br ] . since the latter changes gradually around @xmath0 ,",
    "we conclude that the drop of the halo bias in the bao simulations is associated with the presence of bao .",
    "the scale dependence of the halo bias around the bao scale has been studied previously .",
    "for example , one may find a hint for a bump of the halo bias around @xmath69 for halos with mass @xmath70 in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a peak of the halo bias ( @xmath71 ) near @xmath72 is also detected in @xcite .",
    "this work improves the statistics of the halo bias around the bao scale .",
    "the mass - dependent drop of the bias below @xmath0 is well detected for halo masses down to @xmath19 .",
    "our results are consistent with a flat bias over @xmath66@xmath67 .",
    "we also extend the scale of interest up to @xmath73 where halos are anticorrelated ( so is dark matter ) . because the correlation functions are close to zero in the range of @xmath74@xmath40 , the uncertainties of the halo bias in this range are considerably larger than those below @xmath51",
    ". nevertheless , the results are consistent with a flat bias over @xmath74@xmath40 .",
    "one can also estimate the halo bias from the halo power spectrum @xmath75 and the dark matter power spectrum @xmath76 with @xmath77^\\frac{1}{2}\\right\\rangle.\\ ] ] to obtain the power spectra , we assign the halos and simulation particles to density grids of @xmath78 cells using the daubechies d12 wavelet scaling function , which has superior performance for measuring the power spectrum @xcite .",
    "we then take @xmath79 and @xmath80 , where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the _ discrete _ fourier modes of the halo grid and the dark matter grid , respectively , and @xmath83 denotes an average within each grid .     uncertainties of the mean bias of the ensemble . [ fig : bk ] ]    figure  [ fig : bk ] presents the halo bias determined from the power spectra for the same mass ranges as in figure  [ fig : br ] .",
    "although one does not expect the halo bias to be absolutely constant on large scales , it is still surprising that the bias of @xmath1 halos falls by 11% from @xmath84 to @xmath85 . for halos of mass @xmath2",
    ", the bias falls by less than 4% over the same scales , consistent with the result of @xmath86 in @xcite .",
    "one may notice that there are slight oscillations in the halo bias , which are more pronounced for more massive halos .",
    "this behavior is discussed in the next subsection .",
    "we use the no - bao simulations as references to examine the damping of the bao signal in fourier space .",
    "the halo and dark matter power spectra from each simulation with bao are divided , respectively , by those from the corresponding no - bao simulation .",
    "because the pair of simulations share the same random seed for their initial conditions , the sample variance is greatly reduced .",
    "the power spectrum ratios are shown in the upper panel of figure  [ fig : db ] for @xmath36 halos ( @xmath87 , open circles ) and dark matter ( @xmath88 , filled circles ) .",

    ": ratio of the halo bias in the bao simulations to that in no - bao simulations for @xmath36 halos .",
    "[ fig : db ] ]    there is a subtle difference between figure  [ fig : massdep ] and figure  [ fig : db ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : massdep ] illustrates a mismatch between the shape of the halo correlation functions and that of dark matter around the bao scale .",
    "it does not associate the very presence of bao with the mismatch .",
    "the latter could be an intrinsic difference between the halos and dark matter that happens to occur around the bao scale .",
    "figure  [ fig : bk ] establishes such a link , but the uncertainty is a little high for @xmath36 halos .",
    "the power spectrum ratios in figure  [ fig : db ] suppress the intrinsic difference between halos and dark matter and reduce uncertainties arising from the sample variance .",
    "it demonstrates for @xmath36 halos that the difference between the halo and dark matter bao signals is truly due to the difference in the bao damping mechanism .    by definition",
    ", the above effect is attributed to the halo bias .",
    "the lower panel of figure  [ fig : db ] shows the ratio of the halo bias in the bao simulations to that in no - bao simulations for @xmath36 halos ( same as the halo data divided by the dark matter data in the upper panel ) .",
    "the result oscillates in phase with bao with an amplitude of @xmath89 , suggesting a modulation of the halo bias by bao .",
    "this would not be sensible if halos distributed exactly in proportion to dark matter .",
    "however , if there is nonlinearity in the halo bias , as already evident from its scale dependence in figures  [ fig : br ] and [ fig : bk ] , the bias will depend on the shape of the dark matter power spectrum to some extent .",
    "we have demonstrated with high significance that the bao signal in the halo distribution is dependent on the halo mass . in the correlation function ,",
    "the relative amplitude of the bao peak of @xmath1 halos is considerably higher than that of @xmath2 halos , which in turn is higher than that of dark matter .",
    "since galaxies reside in halos , the bao signal in the galaxy distribution must also depend on the mass of the host halos .",
    "we further show that the halo bias is scale - dependent even on very large scales .",
    "this could be a significant source of systematic errors when one extracts cosmological information ( e.g. , neutrino masses , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , from the overall shape of the galaxy power spectrum .",
    "recently , @xcite detect a higher - than - expected bao peak in the correlation function of galaxy clusters ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "since they fix the baryon fraction while fitting other parameters , the excess bao signal has to be compensated by a very low matter fraction .",
    "although the difference between the halo and dark matter bao signals in our study is not sufficient to explain all the excess bao signal in @xcite , it should be nonetheless a significant contributing factor .",
    "one might expect the trend with halo mass in figures  [ fig : br ] and [ fig : bk ] to continue below @xmath19 .",
    "investigation with @xmath90 halos @xcite shows that the bias of such halos at @xmath91 varies significantly with scales . a simple extrapolation of their results to @xmath7 suggests that the fractional variation of the bias of @xmath90 halos could be even larger than that of @xmath21 halos .",
    "therefore , it is prudent not to extrapolate our results to lower masses .",
    "besides damping the bao signal , nonlinear evolution also shifts the acoustic scale slightly .",
    "we estimate this effect using the fitting formulae in @xcite and find that the fractional shift of the bao feature toward higher wavenumber is @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 for dark matter , @xmath2 halos , @xmath96 halos , and @xmath97 halos , respectively .",
    "these results are consistent with those in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the simple fitting does not converge well for the highest mass range in our study . in this case",
    ", one can use the more sophisticated fitting formula for halos proposed in @xcite .",
    "future galaxy surveys could probe effective volumes of a few hundred @xmath98 , similar to the total volume of the simulations in this study .",
