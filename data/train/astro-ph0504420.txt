    "as a cluster galaxy moves through the intracluster medium ( icm ) , an x - ray bright region trails behind it , revealing its direction of motion .",
    "we now know that there are two physical processes that take place as a galaxy moves through the icm , and lead to the creation of an overdense wake behind it : i ) the accretion of icm ( bondi - hoyle accretion ; sakelliou 2000 ) , and ii ) ram pressure stripping of the galactic material ( stevens et al .",
    "naturally , both processes should take place at the same time ( e.g. , acreman et al . 2003 ) .",
    "depending on the properties of the galaxy and the cluster [ e.g. , the galaxy velocity ( @xmath0 ) and the temperature of the icm ( @xmath1 ) ] , wakes behind galaxies may be visible at x - ray wavelengths .",
    "an understanding and knowledge of their production mechanisms , of the most favourable conditions for detectable wake production , and of their properties would be very rewarding for two main reasons .",
    "firstly , wakes provide the only general means of finding the direction of the motion of the galaxy in the plane of the sky , thus contributing to the study of the dynamics of clusters ( merrifield 1998 ) .",
    "this method of studying clusters has been demonstrated already using both _",
    "rosat _ ( drake et al . 2000 ) and _ chandra _ data ( acreman et al . 2005 ) .",
    "secondly , wakes are manifestations of the galaxy / icm interactions , which modify the properties of both the cluster ( e.g. , by contributing to the metal enrichment of the icm ) and the galaxy ( e.g. , by inducing star formation ) .",
    "thus , they may provide clues to the transformation and subsequent evolution of galaxies in clusters .",
    "our aim was to find the x - ray properties of wakes that had been known from the epoch of _ rosat _ .",
    "figure  1 shows the _ xmm - newton _ image of a first example : the wake associated with the radio galaxy 4c  34.16 .",
    "unfortunately , not many candidates were known from _ rosat _",
    "observations , and we did not have accurate measurements of their properties . _ rosat _ images and spectra of a few systems ( m86 , rangarajan et al .",
    "1995 ; 4c  34.16 , sakelliou et al . 1996",
    "; ngc4472 , irwin & sarazin 1996 ; ngc1404 , jones et al .",
    "1997 ) gave the first clues that wakes exist , and that they might be cooler than the surrounding medium .",
    "the new instrumentation on _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ has provided us with some more evidence that wakes might be a common phenomenon : in deep x - ray images of clusters cores wake - like features have been seen ( e.g. , abell  1795 fabian et al . 2001 ; abell  133 fujita et al .",
    "2002 ; abell  2199 johnstone et al .",
    "temperature maps of limited resolution also suggest that these filaments are cooler than their surrounding media . as other authors have also argued ( e.g. , fabian et al .",
    "2001 ) , wakes must be due to the motion of the central cluster galaxy relative to the icm .",
    "the recent work on the _ xmm - newton _ data of m86 has been very instructive , as it has showed that the ` plume ' associated with that galaxy is metal rich ( finoguenov et al .",
    "however , in all these cases there has been no independent evidence ( at other wavelengths , for example ) which could confirm that the galaxy is moving in the direction indicated by the wake .",
    "1.0    confirmation of the direction of motion of 4c  34.16 comes from the shape of its radio jets .",
    "4c  34.16 is a radio source associated with the central galaxy in the cluster z0357.9 + 9432 .",
    "its plumes are symmetrically bent into a wide c - shape ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the most widely favoured model invokes ram pressure as the main force responsible for the plume bending .",
    "fortunately , the direction indicated by the bent plumes coincides with the direction of the wake , supporting the models of wake production discussed above .",
    "in this paper we present _ xmm - newton _ observations ( section  2 ) of the field around 4c  34.16 . using these data",
    "we derive the properties of the cluster in section  3 , and of the wake in section  4 .",
    "finally , in section  5 we discuss the most favourable models for the wake production , and find the parameters that are consistent with the observations .    throughout this paper",
    "we use a redshift for 4c  34.16 of 0.078 [ nasa / ipec extragalactic database ( ned ) ] .",
    "we adopt a hubble constant of @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , which places the source at 349.3  mpc , and gives a scale of 1.457 kpc arcsec@xmath4 .",
    "the field around 4c  34.16 was observed with _",
    "xmm - newton _ for @xmath527  ksec . during the observation the two mos and pn instruments were operating in the primefullwindow and primefullwindowextended mode respectively ;",
    "the medium filter was used for all three instruments . the optical monitor ( om )",
    "was not switched on , due to the presence of bright stars within the field of view .",
    "the raw event lists from the epic instruments were processed and calibrated with sas v5.3 . during the processing the parameter _",
    "withbadpixfind _ was switched on so that bad pixels that had not been recorded in the calibration files were found and subsequently removed .",
    "after the initial processing we confirmed that new bad pixels were found .",
    "the calibrated events were filtered for flags , using the _ xmm - newton _ flags @xmath6xmmea_em and @xmath6xmmea_ep for the two mos and the pn detectors respectively .",
    "restrictions on the pattern were also applied : we kept only events with pattern@xmath712 for the mos cameras , and @xmath8 for the pn .",
    "the observation was contaminated by background flares , which were apparent in all energy bands . to clean the event lists for image analysis ( section  [ image ] ) , the prescription in read & ponman ( 2003 ) was followed .",
    "this cleaning procedure left a useful exposure of @xmath521  ksec for each the two mos cameras , and @xmath513  ksec for the pn camera .",
    "for the spectral analysis we imposed more strict limits , which reduced the exposures further by @xmath55  ksec ( see section  3.2 ) .    using the filtered and clean event files of each imaging _ xmm - newton _ instrument ,",
    "images and exposure maps were created in the ( 0.3 - 5.0 )  kev energy range .",
    "the images from all three instruments were finally merged after being exposure corrected , using the sas task emosaic .",
    "subsequently , the mosaic was smoothed with an adaptive kernel using ciao s csmooth tool .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] presents the merged image , with the contours of a 1.4-ghz radio map overlaid .",
    "the radio data consist of 1.4-ghz observations in the b and c configurations of the nrao very large array ( vla ) .",
    "the b - configuration data were taken by us on 2002 aug 23 ; the c - configuration data were obtained from the vla data archive ( programme am79 ) .",
    "both datasets were calibrated , merged and imaged within aips in the standard manner . as previously explained",
    ", the central cluster galaxy hosts the double , bent radio source 4c  34.16 . in fig .",
    "[ contours ] we show the contour plot of the merged ( 0.3 - 5.0 )  kev image , overlaid onto the dss optical image of the field around the central galaxy in the cluster , which is the host of 4c  34.16 .",
    "it is apparent from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and fig .",
    "[ contours ] that the cluster is fairly spherically symmetric on large scales .",
    "the core of the radio galaxy coincides with the peak of the x - ray emission , which is not located at the centre of the inner x - ray emission , but is offset to the northeast .",
    "the x - ray emission around the radio galaxy is elongated along a line that bisects the angle between the two radio lobes .",
    "as mentioned before , the shape of the radio galaxy indicates a galactic motion to the north - east .",
    "thus , the asymmetrical x - ray emission could be due to a wake trailing behind the galaxy .    in the following sections we use the _ xmm - newton _ data to derive the properties of the cluster ( section  3 ) and the wake ( section  4 ) .",
    "for the purposes of the following spatial analysis , we generated background subtracted and exposure corrected images independently for each imaging instrument on _ xmm - newton _ .",
    "firstly , images for all three instruments were created in the ( 0.2 - 4.5 )  kev energy range . following read & ponman ( 2003 )",
    ", particle and instrument background maps were created .",
    "they were then subtracted from the data images , after scaling them to the out - of - field events .",
    "the resulting images were corrected for vignetting by multiplying them by the appropriate vignetting maps .",
    "0.95    our final aim was to compare the properties of the wake with those of its environment , so that we can assess the wake production processes .",
    "thus , we used the above generated data images to derive the spatial properties of the cluster .",
    "[ fig1 ] , and [ contours ] demonstrate , the x - ray emission from the wake and the galaxy dominate in the inner cluster region , around the active core . at large distances",
    "the cluster appears fairly symmetric . in order to derive the average cluster properties and compare them with past results , we fitted the ( 0.2 - 4.5 )  kev particle - subtracted vignetting - corrected images in sherpa with a 2-dimensional @xmath9-model .",
    "bright point sources were removed , by excluding circular regions around them . we also decided to exclude the inner @xmath51.3  arcmin around the radio core , and we did not model the emission of the x - ray halo and active nucleus during this fitting procedure .",
    "the 2-dimensional model was convolved with the appropriate point - spread function ( psf ) for each instrument , which is a 2-dimensional image of the psf of each instrument , as implemented in the sas task calview .",
    "data from the three epic instruments were not co - added , but fitted simultaneously . during the fitting procedure , the core radius ( @xmath10 ) and @xmath9 parameter , of the @xmath9-model were linked and left free to vary ; the ellipticity was set to zero ; and the centre of the distribution was fixed to the location of the active core .",
    "the model normalizations were allowed to vary independently for each instrument .",
    "this fitting procedure resulted in a best - fitting value for the core radius of @xmath11 = 2.371[2.336 - 2.412 ]  arcmin=207.26[204.23 - 210.89 ]  kpc , and a @xmath9=0.858[0.829 - 0.890 ] ( 1@xmath12 limits are quoted ) , consistent with the _ rosat _ results ( sakelliou et al .",
    "if the centre of the @xmath9-model is left free to vary , the resulting parameters are consistent within the errors with the ones we present above .",
    "although a derivation of the small scale galaxy s x - ray properties ( galactic x - ray halo and active nucleus ) is outside the scope of this paper , we attempted to model them .",
    "we added another @xmath9-model to describe the galactic halo , and a delta function for the active core .",
    "again , the composite models were convolved with the appropriate instrument psfs .",
    "all trials reproduced the cluster properties found before .",
    "however , the galaxy parameters were poorly constrained .",
    "better quality data are required to allow a determination of the galaxy properties .",
    ".properties of the icm and the wake [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      +    notes : @xmath13 is the specific mass loss rate at the present day [ @xmath14 ( mathews 1989 ) ] .",
    "the mass _ m _ is calculated by _",
    "m_@xmath15=@xmath16(see [ simulations ] for more details ) .",
    "+    0.45 0.45    we ran a number of simulations varying the galaxy velocity ( @xmath17 ) and specific mass loss ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "we present here a set of four runs that best show the dependency of the results on the input parameters , and provide the best match to the _ xmm - newton _ results .",
    "the @xmath17 and @xmath18 used for each run are given in table  [ tsimul ] in columns ( ii ) and ( iii ) respectively .",
    "the specific mass loss @xmath18 is a measure of the mass that is replenished ( _ m_@xmath19 ) within the galaxy from a combination of stellar mass loss and supernovae ( see for more details in stevens et al .",
    "1999 ) . in table  [ tsimul ] [ column ( iv ) ] we also list the _ m_@xmath19 used in the different simulation runs , that is calculated by _ m_@xmath19=@xmath20 .",
    "temperature and density cuts along a line parallel to the direction of the galactic motion are presented in fig .",
    "[ fsimul](a ) and ( b ) respectively , using the simulated data from all four runs . in fig .",
    "[ fsimul](a ) we see that in the low velocity regime the temperature of the wake does not reach the measured value , but is on average @xmath212.2  kev .",
    "however , increasing the mass replenishment rate ( run 2 ) results in the appearance of cold tongues of material that emanate episodically from the galaxy .",
    "these cold features could bring the temperature of the wake down to the measured values .",
    "increasing the mass replenishment rate means that more cold gas is available within the galaxy to be stripped and added into the wake .",
    "however , in simulation 2 , the ram pressure is not strong enough to strip the galaxy , and most of the cold gas ends up accumulating around the galactic centre , increasing the density in the galactic core as seen in fig .  [ fsimul](b ) .",
    "higher galaxy velocities are required to make this cold material accrete into the wake [ fig .",
    "[ fsimul](a ) ] . as we see in the run 4 , the temperature of the wake in the region ( 320 - 460 )  kpc ( which is the distance from the radio core where we measure the x - ray properties of the wake of table  1 ) drops down to @xmath51.5  kev , which is within the range of wake temperatures we measure . in fig .",
    "[ fsimul](b ) we see that in the same region the wake is overdense by a factor between 1.7 and 3.4 , again consistent with the measured ratio from the _ xmm - newton _ data ( see table  1 ) .",
    "thus , a galaxy that is moving at a constant velocity @xmath22 through a medium with a uniform density equal to the central density of the 4c  34.16 cluster , could produce a wake with the measured properties , but _ only if m@xmath19 is as high as @xmath23_. such mass replenishment rates are high , especially for a central cluster galaxy which is a radio galaxy . this becomes clearer if one thinks that the mass replenishment rate in the nearby starburst galaxy m82 does not exceed a few tens of @xmath24 .",
    "thus , we consider the previously presented scenario unrealistic , as the host galaxy needs to contain a huge amount of cold material , to be stripped by ram pressure and accreted onto the wake .      we have found that the mass of the wake is a substantial fraction of the x - ray halo of an elliptical galaxy and large accretion rates are required to produce it .",
    "the only alternative to the section s  [ simulations ] scenario for the wake production is that of a galaxy with a pre - existing halo falling into a cluster : a galaxy with a substantial hot interstellar medium ( ism ) has fallen into the cluster , and is currently crossing the central region of the cluster ; its halo is stripped severely during this crossing , and most of the pre - existing halo forms its wake .",
    "the large - scale structure of the icm provide support to this picture .",
    "the _ rosat _ images ( sakelliou et al .",
    "1996 ) showed that the icm at large radii is elongated along a direction coincident with the direction of the wake and the bent jets .",
    "this characteristic was attributed to a recent disruption of the cluster by a small in - falling group .",
    "such a process has been demonstrated numerically with the recent simulations of acreman et al .",
    "they modelled a spherical galaxy that is falling into a cluster not very different from the one around 4c  34.16 ( they used a cluster temperature of 2.7  kev , while the icm of the 4c  34.16 cluster is at @xmath53.2  kev ( see section  [ cluster_spec ] ) .",
    "their work showed that : i ) the galaxy velocity becomes mildly super - sonic during the core passage ( see their fig .",
    "1 ) ; ii ) most of the halo is stripped during the first core crossing ( see fig .  3 and 4 in acreman et al . ) ; iii ) the galaxy can lose half or more of its ism during its initial travel towards the cluster centre .",
    "according to the above scenario 4c  34.16 should not retain the large quantities of ism found in similar sources ( e.g. , jetha et al . 2005 , hardcastle et al .",
    "2005 ) . in order to see if this is true , we attempted to model the galaxy spectrum in xspec .",
    "the source region was a circle of 10  arcsec radius around the active core .",
    "we fitted the spectrum with a _",
    "mekal+power law _ model modified by the galactic absorption .",
    "the temperature ( @xmath25 ) , power law index ( @xmath26 ) , and normalizations of the two models were left free to vary .",
    "this fitting procedure resulted in a @xmath25 of 0.2  kev and @xmath27 ( @xmath28=15/14 ) .",
    "however , the small number of observed counts meant that the best - fitting parameters were not well constrained .",
    "we found that the unabsorbed luminosity of the thermal component only in the ( 0.6 - 3.5 )  kev energy range is @xmath29 , lower than the luminosity of the ism in 3c465 ( @xmath30 , hardcastle et al .",
    "2005 ) , suggesting that there might be a lack of hot gas from the galaxy in 4c  34.16 .",
    "the close match of the acreman et al .",
    "( 2003 ) results and the x - ray properties of the 4c  34.16 supports strongly the idea that the process simulated by acreman et al . ( 2003 ) represents the best explanation in hand for what is happening around 4c  34.16 .      0.45 0.45    according to the proposed scenario the host galaxy is currently crossing the cluster core and its velocity is mildly supersonic .",
    "such a motion should compress the region in front of the galaxy , resulting in the heating of the icm .",
    "the galaxy is moving relative to its surroundings with a mach number of @xmath31 , the compression factor is 1/@xmath32 . from landau & lifshitz ( 1987 )",
    "we find that such a compression would increase the temperature of the medium in front of the moving galaxy from @xmath53.17  kev up to @xmath335  kev ( in the above calculation we use @xmath34 ) .",
    "this effect can been seen clearly in the results of the simulations in fig .",
    "[ fsimul](a ) , where the temperature in front of the galaxy is enhanced .",
    "the presence of such a hot feature in the _ xmm - newton _ data would provide further support for a supersonic motion .",
    "figure  [ hard ] shows an _ xmm - newton _ image in the ( 5.0 - 8.0 )  kev range .",
    "again , this mosaic is produced in a similar manner to the ones of section  2 , and smoothed with a gaussian kernel with @xmath35  arcsec . as can be seen in this image the emission from the wake",
    "is not visible , as expected , since we have found its emission to be soft and dominant in the soft energy bands .",
    "the hard image reveals a potentially intriguing feature .",
    "there appears to be a ` bar ' of bright emission in front of the galaxy .",
    "this region might be the above - mentioned compression region in front of the galaxy .",
    "the centroid of this ` bar ' is @xmath518  arcsec away from the galactic centre .",
    "one might think that this emission comes from the radio core , but it is very unlike since at other energy ranges there is a very good alignment between the radio core and the x - ray peak .",
    "additionally , we are not aware of pointing errors as large as the measured offset between the ` bar ' and the radio core .",
    "the ` bar ' appears extended and not point - like .",
    "it is detected with a s / n@xmath55 above the local background , which was calculated from the same hard image between 1.5 and 5  arcmin away from the galaxy .",
    "the inspection of optical images does not reveal any obvious source that could be responsible for this hard x - ray emission .    to obtain the spectrum of the ` bar '",
    ", we accumulated counts in an elliptical region in - front of the galaxy with minor and major axes of 12 and 30  arcsec respectively .",
    "the background spectrum was taken in an annulus between 1 and 2.5 arcmin , similar to the one shown in fig .",
    "[ contours ] .",
    "we fitted the spectrum with an absorbed _ mekal _ model .",
    "the @xmath36 and metal abundance were fixed to the galactic value and 0.25 respectively . unfortunately , there are not enough counts in the data to constrain the temperature of the detected feature .",
    "the fits indicate that the temperature is @xmath37  kev ( @xmath38/d.o.f.=27.3/27 ) .",
    "its unabsorbed luminosity is @xmath39 \\simeq 0.7 \\times 10^{41 } \\",

    ", we derived that the density of the ` bar ' should be @xmath41 . using pimms",
    ", we find that the luminosity of a thermal plasma with @xmath42 and @xmath43 properties derived above in the ( 0.5 - 5.0 )  kev energy range is @xmath44 , consistent with the measured value from the _ xmm - newton _ data .",
    "thus , the properties of the hot feature in front of the galaxy might support the previous arguments that the motion of 4c  34.16 is currently supersonic as it is crossing the cluster core .",
    "however , better quality data are required to explore this possibility further .      using the densities and temperatures of the icm and the wake shown in table  1 we find that the wake is in pressure imbalance , by @xmath45 ( where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the thermal pressures of the wake and and icm at the location of the wake , respectively ) .",
    "the pressure imbalance within the wake will be eliminated within @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the local speed of sound , and @xmath50 is the radius of the wake .",
    "the size of the overpressured wake , as measured from the x - ray data is ( 60 @xmath51 120 )  arcsec . using an average radius of @xmath50=65  kpc",
    ", we find that the pressure imbalance will disappear in @xmath52 , assuming that this region of wake material is left behind in the cluster , and that it is not replenished by neither stripped ism nor accreted icm .",
    "this time is slightly smaller than the core crossing time ( @xmath53 ) .    on the other hand , the entropy of the wake is less than the entropy of the surrounding medium : @xmath54 ( where @xmath55 is the entropy of the wake and @xmath56 the entropy of the icm at the location of the wake ) . here",
    ", the entropy is defined as @xmath57 .",
    "entropy imbalances even out by the transport of material towards regions in the surrounding cluster where the entropies match .",
    "thus , the low entropy wake will tend to go towards lower - entropy regions in the cluster , which are at , or close to , the cluster centre , which in the case of 4c  34.16 , coincides with its host galaxy .",
    "therefore , if a cool and dense wake is left behind it will move towards the cluster centre by the buoyancy force : @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the densities of the wake and the icm respectively , and @xmath61 is the cluster s gravitational acceleration : @xmath62 thus , the wake will be driven by an acceleration of @xmath63 where for the calculation of @xmath61 we used eq .",
    "( 2 ) , and the properties of the cluster , as derived in earlier sections .",
    "the time that it will take for the wake to move to the cluster centre is @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the current location of the wake relative to the cluster centre . for @xmath661  arcmin , @xmath67 .",
    "the large uncertainties of the density of the wake ( see section  4.1 ) make the comparison of @xmath68 and @xmath69 difficult . with the current determination of the wake s properties",
    "it is unclear whether the pressure imbalance will disappear quickly , leaving the entropy structure almost unaltered .",
    "we have presented _ xmm - newton _ observations of the x - ray wake that trails behind the wat radio source 4c  34.16 .",
    "our results can be summarized as follows :    * the wake is cooler and denser than the surrounding icm : its temperature is @xmath51.14  kev ; for a filling factot of @xmath70=1 its density is @xmath71 , and for a more realistic @xmath70=0.35 it can be 1.7 times the above value . * a comparison with hydrodynamical simulations shows that the _ xmm - newton _ results fit well with the scenario simulated by acreman et al .",
