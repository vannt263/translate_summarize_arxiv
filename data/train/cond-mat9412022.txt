    "an outstanding unsolved problem in statistical mechanics has been the exact solution of lattice models in three or higher dimensions .",
    "while a host of lattice models has been solved in two dimensions @xcite , very few exact results are known for three or higher dimensions . some two decades ago",
    "suzuki @xcite solved a three - dimensional ising model with pure 4-spin interactions , which turns out to be a two - dimensional model in disguise .",
    "similarly , a three - dimensional 5-edge model solved by orland @xcite is equivalent to a two - dimensional dimer problem @xcite .",
    "the first exact solution of a genuine three - dimensional model was that obtained by baxter @xcite for the zamolodchikov model @xcite , a 2-state interaction - round - a - cube ( irc ) model involving some negative boltzmann weights . since then baxter and bazhanov @xcite",
    "have further extended the solution to the irc model of @xmath2 states for general @xmath2 .",
    "very recently , we have solved a vertex model in arbitrary dimensionality @xcite .",
    "this is a vertex model described by lines which run in a preferred direction on the lattice and do not intersect . like the three - dimensional irc model of refs . @xcite and @xcite",
    ", this model also involves negative boltzmann weights .",
    "while the nonintersecting feature makes it possible to use this model to describe flux lines in type ii superconductors @xcite , the more general version of the model with vertices of intersecting lines remains unsolved .",
    "some twenty - five years ago one of us and fan @xcite introduced the term _ free - fermion model _ to lattice - statistical vertex models satisfying a certain free fermion condition .",
    "when this condition holds , the model can be regarded as one describing free fermions on a lattice @xcite and becomes soluble .",
    "but soluble free - fermion models have been restricted mainly to two dimensions @xcite . in this paper",
    "we extend the solution of @xcite to a free fermion model which includes vertices of intersecting lines in any dimension .",
    "this yields a new class of soluble free fermion models in arbitrary dimensionality .",
    "in the vertex models considered in @xcite , vertex configuration are described by lines embedded on a lattice subject to :    \\i ) lines do not intersect ,    \\ii ) lines are oriented in a preferred direction , and    \\iii ) each loop of line possesses a fugacity @xmath1 .",
    "now we relax condition ( i ) by allowing lines to intersect . for definiteness",
    "we consider a cartesian lattice @xmath3 in @xmath0 dimensions .",
    "place bonds along edges of @xmath3 with the restriction that the number of bonds incident at each vertex is zero or even , with half of the bonds incident in the positive and the other half in the negative axes directions .",
    "the bonds then form lines which run along the main diagonal of @xmath3 .",
    "thus , we have a @xmath4-vertex model with @xmath4 different vertex configurations , where @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the number of lines intersecting at the vertex .",
    "this leads to @xmath7 for @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "number the negative axes incident at a vertex @xmath9 and the positive incident axes @xmath10 , such that @xmath11 refer to the axis in the @xmath12th direction .",
    "denote by @xmath13 the weight of a vertex with bonds ( lines ) incident at @xmath14 and @xmath15 . for vertices with no incident bonds",
    "we take the weight @xmath16 , and for vertices with two incident bonds , one in the negative direction @xmath12 and one in the positive direction @xmath17 , we take the weight to be @xmath18 . for vertices with four or more bonds",
    "the weights are given by the free - fermion condition @xmath19 where the summation is taken over all pairings @xmath20 of axes into pairs @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is the signature of @xmath20 , the number of transposition needed to bring the indices of the pairing to the _ canonical ordering _",
    "@xmath25 here , it is understood that indices not contained in @xmath26 and @xmath27 are deleted in ( 3 ) in determining the canonical ordering . for @xmath28 , for example , ( 2 ) gives    @xmath29    @xmath30    for @xmath31 .",
    "note that the expression ( 2 ) can be written as a determinant as indicated .",
    "the model considered in @xcite corresponds to taking @xmath32 so that the weights ( 4a ) and ( 4b ) vanish identically , indicating that vertices with 4 or more bonds are forbidden .",
    "the vertex weight ( 2 ) can be represented graphically by decomposing the vertex configuration into continuous lines indicated by the pairings .",
    "that is , for each @xmath18 one connects the negative axis @xmath12 to the positive axis @xmath17 . for the vertex weight ( 4b ) , for example",
    ", this leads to the graphs shown in fig .",
    "1 . in this picture and assuming periodic boundary conditions , lines form loops wound around the lattice . let @xmath33 be the overall number of loops when each vertex configuration is decomposed into its canonical ordering .",
    "this permits us to define a partition function @xmath34 now , substitute ( 2 ) into ( 5 ) and observe that when all pairings are in the order of the canonical form we have @xmath35 , and whenever the pairing of two lines interchanges at a vertex , such as changing @xmath36 to @xmath37 in the first line of ( 4a ) , both @xmath33 and @xmath24 change by 1 .",
    "it follows that we can rewrite the partition function ( 5 ) as @xmath38 where the summation is taken over all possible loop configurations of @xmath33 loops , and the product is taken over all @xmath18 factors only , which are present along the loops . in the next section",
    "we show that , in the form of ( 6 ) , the partition function @xmath39 is precisely a dimer generating function .",
    "introduce a dimer lattice @xmath40 by expanding every lattice point of @xmath3 into a  city \" , which we choose to be the one consisting of @xmath41 points located on the @xmath41 incident axes @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the situation of @xmath28 is shown in fig .",
    "2 . let @xmath2 and @xmath44 be the respect numbers of lattice points in @xmath3 and @xmath40 . connect as shown in fig .",
    "2 each point in @xmath42 to every point in @xmath43 , and vice versa .",
    "there are now two kinds of edges in @xmath40 : intercity edges connecting cities and intracity edges within a city . starting from a given vertex configuration on @xmath3",
    ", we cover each intercity edge on @xmath40 by a dimer ( resp .",
    "leave it empty ) if the corresponding edge on @xmath3 is empty ( resp .",
    "covered by a bond ) .",
    "the remaining uncovered points on @xmath40 are then covered by dimers placed along intracity edges .",
    "this latter covering corresponds to the different pairings of the remaining points and is generally not unique .",
    "for example , the different coverings corresponding to @xmath45 and @xmath46 given by ( 4a ) and ( 4b ) together with the associated signs are shown in fig .",
    "3 . in this way , we have mapped vertex configurations into dimer coverings .",
    "we now establish that there is a one - one correspondence between dimer coverings of @xmath40 and loop configurations in ( 6 ) .",
    "consider first dimer coverings on @xmath40 .",
    "superimpose any given dimer covering @xmath47 with a standard one , @xmath48 , in which all intercity edges are covered by dimers .",
    "the superposition of two dimer coverings produces a graph of transition cycles , or polygons @xcite . in the present case",
    ", the transition cycles belong to one of two kinds : double dimers placed on intercity edges , and polygons wound around the lattice forming loops .",
    "thus , each dimer covering is mapped into a loop configuration .",
    "conversely , to each loop configuration in ( 6 ) , there exists a unique dimer covering @xmath47 which , when superimposed upon @xmath48 , produces the loop configuration in question .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "it is well - known that dimer coverings are generated by a pfaffian , provided signs can be fixed correctly @xcite . in the usual dimer problem",
    "all terms in the dimer generating function have the same sign , and for this reason the generating function can be written as a pfaffian only for planar lattices . in the present case ,",
    "however , the partition function ( 6 ) is precisely a pfaffian as we now see .",
    "number the @xmath44 lattice points of @xmath40 in the increasing order along the main diagonal of @xmath3 , and within a city in the order as shown in fig .",
    "2 . direct all intercity edges of @xmath40 in the positive direction and all intracity edges of @xmath40 as shown in fig .",
    "2 . in this way",
    "all edges are directed in the positive directions .",
    "further , the factor @xmath49 in ( 6 ) is generated by taking the dimer weight 1 for intercity edges and weights @xmath50 , for intracity edges .",
    "to fix the sign associated with this product , we consider a typical term in the pfaffian corresponding to the dimer configuration @xmath47 .",
    "the sign of this term relative to the term corresponding to @xmath48 is the product of the signs of the transition cycles produced by the superimposition of @xmath47 and @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "the rule is that each transition cycle carries a sign @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the number of arrows pointing in a given direction when the transition cycle is traversed . for transition cycles consisting of double dimers",
    "we have @xmath53 so that the sign is always positive . for transition cycles",
    "consisting of loops around the lattice we have , since all edges are directed in the same direction , @xmath54 , so that the sign is always negative for each loop",
    ". then the overall sign of @xmath47 relative to @xmath48 is @xmath55 .",
    "this establishes that the partition function ( 6 ) is precisely a pfaffian .",
    "we now evaluate the pfaffian .",
    "let @xmath56 , where @xmath57 be the linear dimensions of @xmath3 .",
    "then the pfaffian is the square root of the determinant of a @xmath58 antisymmetric matrix @xmath59 in the form of a direct product of @xmath60 matrices indexed by @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the @xmath0-dimensional zero matrix , @xmath63 a @xmath64 matrix with elements @xmath65 , and @xmath66 a @xmath64 matrix whose only nonzero element is @xmath67 .    with periodic boundary conditions , matrices in ( 7 )",
    "are invariant when indices @xmath68 are changed by @xmath57 .",
    "then the matrix is block - diagonal in the fourier space .",
    "this leads to the following expression for the partition function @xmath69^{1/2 } \\nonumber   \\\\    & & = \\prod_{n_1=1}^{n_1}\\cdots       \\prod_{n_d=1}^{n_d}{\\rm det } \\bigl| { \\bf b}\\bigr|,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath70 is a @xmath64 matrix with elements @xmath71 and @xmath72 is the complex conjugate of @xmath73 . in this way",
    ", we obtain the per - site free energy @xmath74 where @xmath75 particularly , for @xmath76 and @xmath77 , we have @xmath78 here , the @xmath79 s with 4 or more indices are those defined by ( 2 ) - ( 4b ) . particularly , we have , in addition to those given in ( 4a ) and ( 4b ) , @xmath80 explicitly",
    ", @xmath81 is a linear combination of terms in the form of @xmath82 , where the coefficient @xmath83 is the determinant of the matrix @xmath84 with the @xmath85th rows and columns deleted . by taking @xmath86 for which the free - fermion weights with 4 or more indices vanish identically , these results reduce to those of @xcite .",
    "for @xmath76 the vertices are those of a six - vertex model shown in fig .",
    "4 with the weights @xmath87 note that the free - fermion condition is now @xmath88 and differs slightly ( corresponding to the negation of @xmath89 ) from the usual form @xcite @xmath90 for which the partition function is defined by ( 5 ) without the loop factor @xmath55 . rewriting ( 12 ) and carrying out one integration , say , over @xmath91 , we have @xmath92 this free energy reduces to that of usual free - fermion 6-vertex model after negating @xmath89 @xcite . the equivalence of the two free energies ( with and without the loop factor ) is a property unique to two dimensions .",
    "when one of the two absolute values in ( 14 ) is larger than the other for all @xmath93 , then one can carry out the remaining integration and obtains @xmath94 so that the system is in a `` frozen '' state . now the two absolute values in ( 14 ) are linear in @xmath95 . as a consequence ,",
    "when perturbed from the frozen states ( 15 ) , the two absolute values will cross only at @xmath96 or @xmath97 , near which one of the two absolute values is always larger .",
    "this leads to the two critical conditions @xmath98 at which @xmath99 becomes singular .",
    "near the critical point say , @xmath100 for all @xmath101 , for instance , let @xmath102 then , the singular part of @xmath99 is given by @xmath103 where @xmath104 is determined from @xmath105 it is easy to verify that @xmath106 , and for small @xmath107 the integrand in ( 18 ) is of the order of @xmath108 .",
    "it follow that @xmath109 the same critical behavior is deduced if any of the weights , say , @xmath89 , is negative .",
    "the example of @xmath76 serves to illustrate the origin of the critical behavior and the critical point . after carrying out one - fold integration , @xmath99",
    "is given in the form of an integration of a competition of the logarithms of two absolute values as in the second line of ( 14 ) .",
    "then , the critical point is the point at which the two absolute values are equal and the integrand in ( 14 ) switches from one absolute value to the other for small deviations from the critical point .",
    "this creates a singularity in the free energy .",
    "we shall call this the switching property of the integrand .",
    "a prerequisite for switching to occur is that the ratio of the two absolute values is an extremum in @xmath93 at the critical point . for @xmath76 this can occur only at @xmath110 or @xmath97 .",
    "this leads to a singular part of the free energy in the form of ( 18 ) , where the integration is taken over a region @xmath111 whose boundary is determined by setting the two absolute values equal at fixed small deviation @xmath107 from criticality .",
    "it follows that the singular behavior is that of this integral , namely , @xmath112 , where @xmath113 ( for @xmath76 ) is the volume of @xmath111 .",
    "applying the same argument to @xmath114 , one first carries out one - fold integration over , say , @xmath115 , yielding @xmath116 in the form of an integration of a competition of the logarithms of the absolute values of @xmath117 , the collection of terms in @xmath118 linear in @xmath119 , and @xmath120 , the collection of terms in @xmath118 independent of @xmath119",
    ". then @xmath116 can be singular at points in the parameter space at which the two absolute values become equal and possess the aforementioned switching and extremum property .",
    "namely , there exist angles @xmath121 , such that @xmath122 and @xmath123 for @xmath124 in a neighborhood of @xmath125 , where @xmath107 is the deviation from the critical point .",
    "( here , the roles of @xmath126 and @xmath127 can be interchanged . )",
    "since the integrand of the free energy switches from @xmath128 to @xmath129 for @xmath130 , a singular part in the form of ( 18 ) appears in the free energy , which is the integration of @xmath131 over a region @xmath111 bounded by @xmath132 the critical condition is now given by ( 21 ) and the critical behavior is @xmath112 , where @xmath133 is the volume of the @xmath134-dimensional region @xmath111 .    to determine @xmath133 , we expand @xmath131 about @xmath125 and @xmath135 , obtaining generally the leading behavior @xmath136 where @xmath137 is a constant and @xmath138 . here , due to the extremum property",
    ", @xmath139 is a quadratic form in variables @xmath140 , which is either positive or negative definite .",

    "the singular part of the free energy behaves as @xmath143 this is the critical behavior found in the model @xmath144 @xcite .",
    "the meaning of the singular behavior ( 25 ) for @xmath145 is that the @xmath146$]-th derivative of @xmath116 is discontinuous .",
    "however , the singular behavior ( 25 ) may not be the dominate one .",
    "if the @xmath134-dimensional integral @xmath147 dominant in ( 21 ) - ( 23 ) is also singular at @xmath135 , then the critical behavior of the free energy at @xmath135 is that of a @xmath134-dimensional model . by the same token",
    ", the critical behavior can be reduced further to that of lower dimensions .",
    "examples are given in the next section .",
    "if lines in the vertex model are nonintersecting , then we have the model considered in @xcite with @xmath148 there is no loss of generality in supposing @xmath149 .",
