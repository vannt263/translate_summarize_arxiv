    "of special interest for cosmology  where high - redshift sne  ia  are compared to low - redshift sne  ia  to deduce cosmological parameters  is the question of whether or not sne  iamay arise from multiple channels ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "model , a carbon - oxygen white dwarf accretes matter shed by a less - evolved companion star until it reaches the chandrasekhar mass and explodes .",
    "double degenerate _",
    "scenario consists of the coalescence of a binary white dwarf system .",
    "the role of mass loss in the former scenario suggests an observational test to discriminate between the two models .",
    "the unambiguous detection of circumstellar hydrogen in the spectrum of a sn  ia  would be interpreted as support for the single degenerate scenario .",
    "the search for this signature has resulted in mostly nondetections and upper limits on mass loss from the progenitor system , until recently .",
    "the spectra of the peculiar sn  ia  2002ic @xcite were the first to clearly reveal the interaction of the ejecta of one of these events with its circumstellar medium ( csm ) .",
    "the spectra of sn  2002ic  resembled those of the spectroscopically peculiar , overluminous sn  ia  1991 t , with features characteristic of a sn  ia  though `` diluted '' @xcite .",
    "most remarkably , these spectra exhibit narrow h@xmath0  emission consistent with the redshift of the sn ( @xmath6 , * ? ? ?",

    "more circumstantial evidence obtained by comparing late time spectra of sne  iin  1997cy and 1999e with sn  2002ic  @xcite suggests that some fraction of sne  iin , ostensibly core - collapse sne , may in fact be sne  ia  veiled by a substantial csm .",
    "various interpretations of the observations of sn  2002ic  have appeared in the literature .",
    "motivated by the large mass inferred for the csm , @xcite suggested that the progenitor system contained a massive asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) star which shed the material prior to explosion . the agb star could be a binary companion star , or the sn progenitor itself ( a type 1.5 sn , * ? ? ?",
    "most analyses agree that the density of the csm was high , that a few tenths to several solar masses of material were shed , and that the mass loss rate was high or the csm was clumpy @xcite .",
    "spectropolarimetry suggested that the geometry of the csm was aspherical , and perhaps equatorially condensed @xcite . a light curve analysis @xcite implied a delay in the onset of the circumstellar interaction , suggesting that the mass loss phase had ended or trailed off in the years preceding the sn or that the inner csm had been cleared by a fast wind , both consistent with the formation of a proto - planetary nebula ( ppn ; @xcite ) by an agb star .    instead of an agb scenario , @xcite suggested that sn  2002icwas in fact the product of a double degenerate merger during the common envelope ( ce ) phase of a binary ; the white dwarf spirals in to coalesce with its companion s core .",
    "however , the disk - like geometry and large radial extent of the csm inferred from spectropolarimetry @xcite and coalescence timescales that are incompatible with the timescale inferred for the mass ejection @xcite seem to rule out the ce coalescence model for sn  2002ic .",
    "motivated in part by the inferred presence of considerable csm surrounding sn  2002ic , @xcite advanced a hypothesis to explain the low values @xmath7e(@xmath8-@xmath9 )  often derived from observations of sne  ia . instead of the value @xmath10 expected for dust extinction in the galaxy and lmc , values @xmath113",
    "are often found @xcite . in this hypothesis ,",
    "dust in the immediate vicinity of the sn or at the highest velocities of its ejecta scatter sn light into the observer line of sight , thus adding back light and effectively reducing derived values of @xmath12 in the optical .",
    "the source of the dust may be a pn or ppn formed during the evolution of the progenitor system .",
    "this explanation suggests a continuum of models for ejecta - csm interaction in sne  ia .",
    "sne  ia  with more normal values of @xmath13 could represent cases where the pn has had enough time to disperse into the host interstellar medium .",
    "cases where @xmath13 is low but there is no csm interaction signature could occur in diffuse pne . still others ( such as sn  2002ic ) with a strong csm interaction signature might originate in more compact pne or ppne .    here",

    "the two sne are hosted by low - luminosity galaxies at about the same redshift , and their spectra at about 70 days after explosion are remarkably similar .",
    "there are , however , important differences between the two events .",

    "cosmic rays were detected and corrected using a 3d - filtering scheme applied to the datacubes .",
    "sn and standard star spectra were extracted from the 225 spaxels , @xmath23 , of each @xmath22-datacube using a wavelength - dependent gauss - newton psf fit method by minimizing @xmath24 .",
    "the adopted psf model is @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the supernova spectrum , @xmath27 is the psf integrated over one spatial element , and @xmath28 is a spatially uniform background distribution .",

    "these fluxes were then normalized by the flux on a specific night considered photometric , allowing us to make an estimation of the relative flux extinction in each filter band for the observations on non - photometric nights . seeing and the stability of the atmospheric transmission were assessed using snifs guider video frames acquired during our exposures .    variable cloud conditions prevailed on the night of 2005 october  3  utc .",

    "the s / n ratio of the spectrum is 100 or greater per 1.43    pixel over the range 4000 - 9000   .    while correction for atmospheric differential refraction is unimportant for this spectrum , since atmospheric seeing is wavelength dependent the amount of light lost at the lris slit also depends on wavelength .",
    "this effect is important for slit - widths comparable to the seeing  as with these observations  and its incorporation into the flux calibration is very dependent on the seeing and mis - centering experienced by the standard stars relative to that experienced by the target . as snifs does not suffer from this effect , we defer to the snifs spectrum taken this same night when performing fits to the flux over a long wavelength baseline .",

    "moreover , for so much dust there would be very poor agreement between the blackbody radius and the sn ejecta radius at day  11 .",
    "instead , it is more likely that the h level populations are not in case  b. the balmer decrement can be greatly enhanced at high density when the optical depth in the h@xmath0  line is high .",
    "@xcite demonstrate this effect for a static slab of h , and attribute it to a combination of balmer self - absorption ( i.e. , in which resonant trapping leads to h@xmath2",
    "@xmath107  h@xmath0  @xmath58  p@xmath0 ) and collisional excitation ( also see * ? ? ?",
    "the sn - csm interaction models of @xcite show this effect , giving h@xmath0/h@xmath2  @xmath108 after 1  year",
    ". further support for a high - density region comes from the presence of strong  @xmath37065 and the lack of evidence for  @xmath34471 or @xmath36678 at day  71 .",
    "the calculations by @xcite suggest that a minimum electron density of @xmath109  @xmath110  is required to produce such line ratios .",
    "clearly , the sn  2005gj  line ratios offer a number of interesting clues concerning the nature of the csm .    as noted in ",
    "[ sec : spectral_analysis ] , a double gaussian plus p  cygni profile provides an excellent fit to the h@xmath0  and h@xmath2lines .",
    "the fits to  @xmath35876 and  @xmath37065 prefer a flatter , red - shifted broad component .",
    "the question arises as to whether or not these line profiles are consistent with a broad component from a shock front and a narrow component in a photoionized outer region .",
    "@xcite has calculated expected line profiles for emission in sn  csm shocks .",
    "the shapes can be quite complex depending on whether pure scattering dominates over collisional effects , but generally have a roughly parabolic shape or a relatively flat - topped shape .",
    "another case of interest would be that of a shock propagating through a disc , which should give a two - horned profile .",
    "none of the example situations give the symmetric gaussians that we see for the balmer lines .",
    "indeed , one of the puzzles here is why the broad component would be symmetric at all given that the redshifted portion of the csm interaction should be occulted by the sn  ia  or the optically - thick foreground csm .",
    "on the other hand , the broad components of the lines are weak , and probably asymmetric and flat - topped .",
    "therefore , it is unclear how much balmer emission is co - spatial with the lines .",
    "however , thomson scattering of the lines also must be considered @xcite .",
    "a simple monte carlo simulation shows that for modest optical depth thomson scattering produces a line profile consisting of a narrow core from unscattered photons and broad wings due to the scattered photons .",
    "the width of the broad component and the ratio of the broad and narrow thomson - scattering components depend on the electron velocity , @xmath111 , and the scattering optical depth , @xmath112 .",
    "as most of the difference between a thomson - scattering line profile and a simple double - gaussian occurs in the wings , the undulating sn component makes it difficult to discriminate between these two cases . for a @xmath113  k blackbody , @xmath114  @xmath45 , in rough agreement with the width of the broad component of h@xmath0 .",
    "our fit to h@xmath0using monte carlo calculations gives @xmath115 .",
    "an electron density of @xmath116  @xmath110 and a length scale of order @xmath117 gives an thomson scattering optical depth that agrees with these estimates .",
    "this shows that thomson scattering alone could account for the observed broad hydrogen features for parameters consistent with a shock .",
    "a thomson - scattering origin for the line widths suggests that both the broad and narrow components of the h emission lines could arise from a single , dense region .",
    "this could help to explain why the balmer decrement is large for the narrow component as well as for the broad component ; h@xmath0/h@xmath2  for the narrow components would be expected to have close to the case  b ratio if they arise , e.g. , from photoionization of a protoplanetary nebula .",
    "a single origin would also explain why the ratio of the narrow and broad components is not changing appreciably with time . here",
    "the fwhm of the emission lines would no longer be related to @xmath118 . in this picture",
    "there is still material traveling at @xmath103 in front of the shock , since blue - shifted , p  cygni - like absorption is seen , but a low - density photoionized region from a precursor wind would not be required .",
    "emission from h@xmath0  will be heavily weighted towards high density regions .",
    "assuming regions of roughly constant density , possibly having a filling factor less than unity , we may write the h@xmath0  luminosity as : @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the mass in the shock region and @xmath121 is the effective h recombination coefficient . here",
    "we assume that the emitting region is 90%  h and 10%  he by number , and that he@xmath122 and he@xmath123 are both present .",
    "@xcite took @xmath124 , the case  b recombination coefficient .",
    "however , @xcite advocates @xmath125 , the case  c recombination coefficient , when the balmer optical depth is large , as is the case for the sn  2005gj  csm .",
    "taking @xmath126 we find that @xmath127  is required to explain the observed h@xmath0  luminosity .",
    "note that this mass estimate applies only to the mass in the emitting region .",
    "the measured @xmath128 and inferred thomson optical depth can be used to set more direct constraints on the dimensions of the emitting region .",
    "for example , for @xmath126 and a radius @xmath129  cm , @xmath130 would be contained in a spherical shell with @xmath131  cm .",
    "such a shell would not be optically thick due to electron scattering and is therefore inconsistent with our measurements . if instead @xmath132 , then the h@xmath0-emitting gas would be @xmath133 and the shell radius would be @xmath134  cm and the emitting region would be optically thick to thomson scattering .",
    "alternatively , as the visibility of the sn requires the presence of an opening in the shock front , we can imagine the emitting region as a working its way through a circumstellar disk .",
    "if the emitting region were at a radius @xmath129  cm with mass @xmath135 the emitting region would have characteristics dimensions of @xmath136  cm , where @xmath137 is the thickness .",
    "this region would be optically thick to thomson scattering and this configuration would allow the sn  ia  to be easily seen .",
    "more generally , we may combine these basic ingredients to give the value of @xmath138 that will produce the correct thomson optical depth and h@xmath0luminosity from a region with characteristic size @xmath137 : @xmath139 we find @xmath140  @xmath110 and @xmath141  cm .",
    "the total mass in the emitting region would then be @xmath142 this analysis disagrees with our density estimate from the h and he line ratios and the sizes inferred from our sn ejecta speed or blackbody luminosity calculations .    however , if the emitting mass is in the form of @xmath143 equal clouds , the value of @xmath144 increases in proportion to @xmath143 , @xmath137 decreases proportionately in order to maintain the electron scattering optical depth for each cloud , and the total mass over all clouds decreases as @xmath143 . to reach @xmath145",
    "@xmath110 requires @xmath146 clouds .",
    "such clouds could be similar to fingers from rayleigh - taylor instability that produce a corrugated sn - csm interface in the @xcite model for sn  2002ic .",
    "motion of the clouds could contribute to the gaussian shape of balmer line profiles , possibly decreasing the electron - scattering optical depth we have inferred .    while electron scattering is able to explain the line profiles we observe , it is worthwhile considering the possibility that the electron scattering optical depth is low . in this case",
    "the broad component would be due to the kinematics of the shock . in the thin - shell approximation @xcite",
    ", @xmath118 evolves as @xmath147 , where @xmath148 is the power - law index of the density profile of the outer sn ejecta and @xmath23 is the power - law index of the csm material .",
    "while sn  ia  outer density profiles are not thought to follow a power law , @xmath149 is often taken as an adequate approximation for application of the self - similar solution of the thin - shell approximation . the constant csm density ,",
    "@xmath150 , profile inferred from the lightcurve then gives @xmath151 .",
    "we have measured the balmer line widths spanning a factor of 10 in time and do not detect any significant change in those widths . the only ways to maintain a constant @xmath118 are to have @xmath152  at odds with the lightcurve  or to have an unphysically steep , @xmath153 , outer density profile for the sn ejecta .",
    "thus there is an apparent inconsistency with the classic shock model explanation for the broad component    further aggravating this inconsistency is the constancy of the balmer emission . in the shocked region itself ,",
    "the h@xmath0  luminosity is proportional to the time rate of dissipation of kinetic energy at the shock front , @xmath154 where @xmath155 is the rate at which the csm is swept up by the shock @xcite .",
    "therefore the stability of @xmath156 requires a very fine tuning between @xmath155 and @xmath118 .",
    "this is true for any shock , whether or not the broad component is due to electron scattering . in our discussion of electron scattering",
    "we considered the case of a large population of clouds . here",
    ", the shock would interact with different clouds at different times , substantially smoothing the emission - weighted @xmath118 and @xmath128 .",
    "while determining the exact shape , hydrodynamic state and radiative structure of the csm would require detailed modeling beyond the scope of this paper , our observations combined with some rough approximations have allowed us to infer that the csm has a high density and that the optically thick emitting region can not significantly cover the sn  ia .",
    "a high density is also consistent with the absence of detectable x - ray emission @xcite , although the large x - ray opacity of the sn  iaenvelope could be equally important @xcite .",
    "likewise , the null detection in the radio @xcite may be due to absorption by thermal electrons in the dense csm .",
    "line absorption from a circumstellar wind is detected extending out to our last date of observation .",
    "the good agreement of the lightcurve with a flat density profile suggests that the current interaction is not with a classical @xmath157 wind .",
    "although there is no evidence for delayed csm interaction , as was seen for sn  2002ic , it is possible that a fast wind from the white dwarf has piled up material where the interaction is now occurring @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the mass loss may have tapered off with time , producing a flatter density profile .",
    "the mass of the emitting region is quite small if the densities are as high as we have inferred . unlike the classical case where the narrow balmer emission arises from the photoionized precursor wind , in our picture we can not use equation  [ eq : lifanhlum ] to place a lower limit on the mass in the wind",
    "therefore , the total csm mass remains uncertain , and will have to be estimated using a self - consistent radiative hydrodynamic model .",
    "one remaining clue to the nature of the sn - csm interaction is the inverted p  cygni profile of [ ]  @xmath35007 seen in the keck spectra on days  71 and 133 .",
    "the inverted p  cygni profile morphology is extremely interesting , and could indicate that the line forms in a region that is excited from the outside rather than from the sn , and forms in the intershock region . a very high density is required to achieve sufficient optical depth for absorption in the line .",
    "the oxygen abundance of high - velocity sn  ia  material should be much higher than that found in the csm @xcite and therefore we conclude that the feature is most likely to originate within the sn ejecta .",
    "one of the potentially powerful applications of rare events like sn  2005gj  is in understanding the progenitor systems of sne  ia .",
    "while the interaction with the csm provides many clues to the progenitor system , the host galaxy environment adds additional information and helps to place such in events in the context of star formation and evolution models .",
    "sn  2005gj  is a rare example in which observations of the host galaxy place interesting constraints on the likely progenitor age and metallicity . in this section",
    "we explore the broader implications of our host - galaxy measurements .",
    "if the progenitor system of sn  2005gj  shares the approximately @xmath158  myr age of the starburst dominating the host galaxy , this places some constraints on the allowed parameters of the progenitor system . a 3  m@xmath159 star  thought to be the minimum mass for forming a type  ia from a carbon - oxygen white dwarf  will take 400  myr to complete its he - burning phase according to the evolutionary models of @xcite for stars with @xmath160 .",
    "a 4  m@xmath159 star requires only 190  myr .",
    "thus , the inferred age of the starburst is quite consistent with the mass range of sn  ia  progenitors derived from other stellar evolution calculations ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "simulations by @xcite indicate that , for their fiducial model parameter settings , both single - degenerate and double - degenerate channels will just barely have become operative 200  myr after birth of the progenitor system .",
    "better agreement with a 200  myr timescale is obtained by decreasing the ce efficiency factor .",
    "broadly speaking , single - degenerate progenitors tend to have timescales that are strongly clumped in the 200 to 800  myr timescale , while double - degenerate progenitors tend to occur more uniformly over a 100  myr to 10  gyr timescale .",
    "thus , the age of the host starburst is consistent with modeled timescale estimates for both single - degenerate and double - degenerate progenitors . on the other hand ,",
    "if sn  2005gj  is associated with the old stellar population in its host galaxy , the @xcite models suggest that the double - generate scenario would dominate after several gyr .    the low metallicity derived for the host galaxy may be important in understanding sn  2005gj .",
    "the metallicity is likely to have an impact on how quickly the winds from the progenitor or donor star can be swept out of the system via radiation pressure from a hot wd , with low metallicity increasing the likelihood that csm will be present when the sn  iaeventually explodes .",
    "extreme metallicities may even lead to new channels for thermonuclear sne .",
    "for example , @xcite argue that metal - free ( [ fe / h]@xmath161 ) stars in the range @xmath162 could explode as thermonuclear sne inside a dense unburned hydrogen envelope .",
    "this is close to the type 1.5 scenario where the carbon - oxygen core of a single massive asymptotic giant branch star undergoes a thermonuclear explosion @xcite .",
    "while we have only an upper limit on the likely metallicity of the progenitor system based on the host galaxy , it seems unlikely that the metallicity is as low as required in this scenario .",
    "@xcite has suggested that a low mass loss rate from an agb star due to low metallicity could allow the carbon - oxygen core to reach the chandrasekhar limit , leading to a type  1.5 .",
    "an example is a star with @xmath163}=-1 $ ] and an initial mass of 6.5  @xmath164 ; such a star would complete its evolution in @xmath165  myr @xcite .",
    "a progenitor star of such mass is unlikely given our starburst age estimate , but a progenitor of slightly lower mass would be allowed . in the @xcite scenario , this would require @xmath163}<-1 $ ] , and would require that the metallicity of the host of sn  2005gj  fall significantly below the standard galaxy luminosity - metallicity relation .",
    "more apropos would be the studies such as @xcite examining the relation between progenitor metallicity and accretion onto a classical carbon - oxygen wd .",
    "they find that at low metallicity the deposition rate is too high due to the reduced radiation pressure from the wd on the infalling material ; low metallicity systems thus fail to produce type  ia events .",
    "@xcite present the allowed values of donor mass and orbital period for solar and 0.2@xmath166 solar abundance for a main sequence donor and red giant donor .",
    "our age limit from the host starburst precludes their 1  @xmath164 red giant as a donor , while our upper limit of @xmath167 shrinks the allowed mass of the main sequence donor in their models to @xmath168 ( and an orbital period in the range @xmath169 days ; the range of separation between the donor and a white dwarf of 1.4  @xmath164 placed by these limits is @xmath170 cm @xmath171 cm ) .",
    "other possibilities include the @xcite model for sn  2002ic , in which the merger of two white dwarfs immediately follows a common envelope ( ce ) phase . in this model , the merger due to gravitational radiation",
    "occurs after a common envelope stage has finished expelling mass from the system .",
    "* eq .  ( 3 ) ) argue against this scenario in the case of sn  2002ic  because the white dwarf and core can not get close enough to merge via gravitational radiation on a timescale commensurate with the presence of csm .",
    "getting the white dwarf and core sufficiently close would require removal of energy via the envelope , but the observed csm velocities are simply too low .",
    "this is also the case for sn  2005gj .",
    "we infer that mass loss ended at most 8 years prior to explosion , so as with sn  2002ic , the timescale for gravitational wave radiation after the ce phase is very short . likewise ,",
    "the velocity required for removal of sufficient energy via the envelope is too low by well over an order of magnitude .",
    "perhaps more interesting in the case of sn  2005gj  is the scenario recently described by @xcite in which a delayed dynamical instability operating over a period of @xmath172  yrs allows a @xmath173 donor star to eject @xmath174 of material out of the binary system while a trickle of mass builds up an already massive wd to the point of thermonuclear explosion .",
    "while constructed to explain sn  2002ic , this model seems to be consistent with what we have been able to infer from our observations of sn  2005gj .",
    "more detailed modeling of sn  2005gj  will be needed , however , in order to test the @xcite scenario .",
    "this model gives in a predicted incidence of csm - interacting sne  ia  in the range 0.0010.01 , which agrees within the large uncertainties with the 2 - 4 such systems discovered over the past 10 years in which @xmath175 nearby sne  ia  have been reported . a prediction of the @xcite model  which did not arise directly from sn  2002ic",
    " is that the highest incidence of such events will occur 0.11  gyr after the birth of the progenitor system ; our age estimate for sn  2005gj  falls squarely within this window .    in a cosmological context",
    "it is interesting to ask whether a sn  ialike sn  2002ic  or sn  2005gj  could mistakenly be included among a sample of normal sn  ia  used to fit for the cosmological parameters . at high redshift the h@xmath0  emission feature in our day  11 spectrum would be redshifted out of the typical observing window .",
    "thus , an observer would see the smooth spectrum of a hot blackbody , likely superimposed on the spectrum of a blue host galaxy , and probably classify the event has an early , overluminous sn  ii .",
    "several examples matching this description are shown in @xcite . at later times ,",
    "when the classical sn  ia  features are apparent , the diluting affects of the csm emission could be mistaken for host galaxy light , e.g. , from a starburst , resulting in a sn  iaclassification ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for descriptions of the standard spectral classification techniques applied at high redshift )",
    ". a much stronger discriminant is the lightcurve shape . in the case of sn  2005gj",
    ", the flat lightcurve would be a clear indicator of a serious problem .",
    "however , as can be seen in @xcite for the case of sn  2002ic   for which the csm interaction is weaker and its onset delayed  lightcurve data at least 40 days after maximum light would be needed to detect a problem .",
    "such data usually was not available in the supernova cosmology project or high - z supernova search team sn  ia  cosmology searches of the late 1990 s .",
    "more modern rolling searches such as the supernova legacy survey @xcite and essence @xcite contain such data except for sne  ia  discovered late relative to the observing window for a given program field .",
    "as the high - redshift sn  ia  searches have netted several hundred events to date , events like sn  2005gj  and sn  2002ic  should have been detected unless their incidence declines strongly with redshift .",
    "in fact , the opposite trend is expected , as the type of low - metallicity starburst likely to have spawned sn  2005gj  should be more prevalent at high redshift .",
    "sn  2005gj , sn  2002ic , and sn",
    "1997cy all exhibit large csm interactions and arose in low - luminosity hosts .",
    "this underscores the importance of blind searches that are not biased towards bright known hosts for surveys that aim to provide data for understanding sn  ia  physics .",
    "it also raises questions about the consistency between the currently available nearby sne sample ( taken mostly from targeted galaxy searches ) and the distant sne sample ( taken primarily from untargeted searches ) .",
    "first classified as type iin and then displaying clear type ia features , sn  2005gj  is the second supernova spectroscopically confirmed to possess type ia features combined with a strong csm interaction . of these",
    "two confirmed events and two suspected such events , sn  2005gj  presented the largest observed csm interaction , and its early behavior raises the question of how many of the early detected sne  iin  might be similar events .",
    "the lightcurve and spectroscopy presented here offer a wealth of information .",
    "much more detailed modeling will help in understanding the nature of progenitor system , and could be a key to understanding important aspects of the formation of type  ia supernovae .",
    "better statistics from larger unbiased nearby supernova searches will help greatly in understanding the possibly multiple channels that produce sne  ia .",

    "<S> this is in contrast to sn  2002ic , for which an inner cavity in the circumstellar material was inferred . within the context of the thin - shell approximation , </S>",
    "<S> the early lightcurve is well - described by a flat radial density profile for the circumstellar material . </S>",
    "<S> however , our decomposition of the spectra into type  ia and shock emission components allows for little obscuration of the supernova , suggesting an aspherical or clumpy distribution for the circumstellar material . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the emission line velocity profiles arise from electron scattering rather than the kinematics of the shock . </S>",
    "<S> this is supported by the inferred high densities , and the lack of evidence for evolution in the line widths . </S>",
    "<S> ground- and space - based photometry , and keck spectroscopy , of the host galaxy are used to ascertain that the host galaxy has low metallicity ( @xmath4 ; 95% confidence ) and that this galaxy is undergoing a significant star formation event that began roughly @xmath5  myr ago . </S>",
