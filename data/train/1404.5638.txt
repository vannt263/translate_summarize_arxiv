    "a combination of different observational findings leads to the conclusion that a corona is present also in the milky way @xcite .",
    "a long - standing question is whether these atmospheres are thermally unstable ( in the sense of @xcite ) : if local thermal instability ( ti ) occurs , cold gaseous clouds can condense throughout the plasma ; otherwise , substantial cooling can only happen at the system center , where , however , it is expected to be opposed by feedback from the central supermassive black hole .",

    "we have shown that rotating , radiatively cooling atmospheres with ordered weak magnetic fields ( and therefore anisotropic heat conduction ) are unstable to axisymmetric perturbations , in the sense that there is always at least one growing axisymmetric mode .",
    "the physical implications of this formal result clearly depend on the nature of this instability , which we try to address in the present work .",
    "in particular , we want to explore whether the linear instabilities found in are over - stabilities or monotonically growing instabilities , how the evolution of the instability depends on the properties of the perturbation and what are the driving physical mechanisms .",

    "figure  [ fig : rate ] also shows that varying @xmath190 has generally a small effect on the maximum growth rate , though the trend is that @xmath189 is larger for larger vertical velocity gradients , so baroclinic models tend to be more unstable than barotropic models ( as well known , vertical velocity gradients are destabilizing even in the absence of magnetic fields ; see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .    for both mwg and ccc models ,",

    "we have provided the equations that allow to determine the linear evolution of axisymmetric and non - axisymmetric perturbations at any position of a differentially rotating plasma in the presence of a weak ordered magnetic field . given a model for the background plasma ,",
    "the evolution of axisymmetric perturbations can be computed by solving numerically the dispersion relation  ( [ eq : disp_np13 ] ) .",
    "the evolution of non - axisymmetric perturbations can be determined by integrating numerically the system of odes  ( [ eq : nonaxi_final_1]-[eq : nonaxi_final_3 ] ) .",
    "we have studied the stability properties of rotating models representative of cool cores of galaxy clusters and coronae of milky way - like galaxies . in all cases we found monotonically unstable axisymmetric modes .",
    "the instability is dominated by the hbi in cool cores and by a combination of ti and mti in galactic coronae ( with the exception of models with very weak poloidal component of the magnetic field , in which the mri is the dominant instability ) .",
    "3 .   for the same galaxy and galaxy - cluster models ,",
    "we have computed the linear evolution of several non - axisymmetric disturbances , finding that the linear non - axisymmetric modes behave similarly to axisymmetric modes with the same wave - length and orientation in the meridional plane , so these systems are locally unstable against general perturbations . in particular ,",
    "in contrast with the unmagnetized case , differential rotation does not stabilize blob - like disturbances in the presence of an ordered magnetic field .",
    "4 .   overall , magnetized systems are more prone to local ti than unmagnetized systems : in particular , thermal perturbations tend to be effectively damped by isotropic heat conduction in unmagnetized systems , while , under certain conditions , they can grow monotonically and lead to local condensations in the presence of magnetic fields .",
    "differential rotation plays a crucial role in the studied instabilities .",
    "remarkably , if the magnetic field is sufficiently weak the mri is dominant even in pressure - supported systems such as galactic coronae and cool cores of galaxy clusters .",
    "but also when the mri is not strong , differential rotation can favor the onset of either the mti or the hbi , which , combined with the ti , can lead to local condensation of cold gas . the presence of vertical velocity gradient is destabilizing , so baroclinic models tend to be more unstable than barotropic models .",
    "the original motivation of the present investigation was the question of whether cold clouds can form spontaneously throughout the virial - temperature atmospheres of galaxies and clusters of galaxies . in this work",
    "we have focused on differentially rotating plasmas , because rotation is potentially relevant in the atmospheres of both galaxies @xcite and galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "a necessary condition for the spontaneous formation of cold clouds via ti is that , at least in the linear regime , thermal perturbations grow monotonically .",
    "our results suggest that in the presence of a weak ordered magnetic field , provided that the mri is not dominant and that the gas temperature is relatively low , thermal perturbations can lead to local condensation through a combination of the ti with either the mti or the hbi .",
    "therefore the formation of cold clouds via local ti is hampered in the cluster cool cores , while it is possible under specific conditions in galactic coronae . while the gas temperature of galactic and galaxy - cluster atmospheres is relatively well constrained ( either observationally or theoretically ) , much less",
    "is known about the distribution of their specific angular momentum and the geometry of their magnetic field . in the hypothesis that the conditions are such that linear thermal perturbations grow monotonically ,",
    "we are left with the question of the non - linear evolution of these unstable systems , which could be addressed with mhd simulations ( see , for the non - rotating case , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "one possibility is that , in the non - linear regime , finite - size cold clouds form and the medium becomes multiphase , but it is also possible that the main outcome of the instability is that the magnetic field is rearranged in a configuration that counteracts the development of further instabilities or that the gas becomes highly turbulent and the magnetic field highly tangled .",
    "a limitation of the present work is that , even in the presence of ordered magnetic fields , we have assumed for simplicity pressure to be isotropic , neglecting the @xcite viscosity . in fact , in a magnetized plasma anisotropic momentum transport can affect the stability properties of the plasma : for instance , studying non - rotating models of cluster cool cores , @xcite and @xcite concluded that , in the presence of @xcite viscosity , the hbi is substantially reduced , being localized only in the inner 20% of the cluster core .",
    "the question of whether and how much the results of the present work are affected by @xcite viscosity can be addressed by extending the calculations to the case in which anisotropic pressure is self - consistently included : such an investigation would represent a natural follow - up of this paper .",

    "<S> a long - standing question is whether radiative cooling can lead to local condensations of cold gas in the hot atmospheres of galaxies and galaxy clusters . </S>",
    "<S> we address this problem by studying the nature of local instabilities in rotating , stratified , weakly magnetized , optically thin plasmas in the presence of radiative cooling and anisotropic thermal conduction . for both axisymmetric and non - axisymmetric linear perturbations we provide the general equations that can be applied locally to specific systems to establish whether they are unstable and , in case of instability , to determine the kind of evolution ( monotonically growing or over - stable ) and the growth rates of unstable modes . </S>",
    "<S> we present results for models of rotating plasmas representative of milky way - like galaxy coronae and cool - cores of galaxy clusters . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the unstable modes arise from a combination of thermal , magnetothermal , magnetorotational and heat - flux - driven buoyancy instabilities . </S>",
    "<S> local condensation of cold clouds tends to be hampered in cluster cool cores , while it is possible under certain conditions in rotating galactic coronae . </S>",
    "<S> if the magnetic field is sufficiently weak the magnetorotational instability is dominant even in these pressure supported systems . </S>"
