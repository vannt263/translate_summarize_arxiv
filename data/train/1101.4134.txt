    "the data of neutrino oscillation experiments revealed a very noticeable form of a mixing matrix with @xmath5 and @xmath6 at the @xmath7 confidence level(cl ) .",
    "the current data also include the mass squared differences which are accompanied by solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively@xcite@xcite .",
    "the central values of the elements of the pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata(pmns ) matrix are pointing a unique form of the matrix , which consists of @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the three - flavor neutrino mixing matrix specified by those angle sizes is called tri - bi - maximal(tbm ) mixing@xcite , based on the idea that the neutrino mass matrix in a lepton flavor basis is an @xmath12 group matrix and a canonical subgroup @xmath13 plays a role of a @xmath14 interchange@xcite .",
    "therefore , its elegant form suggests that the mass model has originated from a flavor symmetry . models with various types of discrete flavor symmetries have been constructed @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "a previous study considered a minimal seesaw model with only two righthanded neutrinos , where texture zeros and equalities in the dirac mass matrix constrain the number of parameters and all the elements of the @xmath15 dirac matrix can be expressed in terms of low energy physical parameters@xcite . in this study",
    ", @xmath0 symmetry is adopted to construct a minimal seesaw model , which is established with a small content of additional fields beyond the standard model(sm ) .",
    "the higgs contents are extended to include three @xmath16 doublet scalars in one- or two- dimensional representations of @xmath4 addition to the standard model higgs , and then the model has a relatively simple higgs potential , while the models with three righthanded neutrinos constructed in a group framework of the same kind should have included a rather complicated potential@xcite@xcite .",
    "the model naturally represents @xmath14 symmetry and the properties of group @xmath0 lead the basis to the one in which the charged lepton mass matrix is diagonal . since the exact @xmath0 symmetry for a given field content and given charge assignments is necessary , a meaningful issue can be the deviation from tbm mixing as a consequence of the symmetry breaking by a few vevs .",
    "the outline is as follows .",
    "section ii introduces the framework within the flavor symmetry and the lagrangian .",
    "the aspects that may arise during the symmetry breaking processes and their low energy effects since the seesaw mechanism are reported in section iii .",
    "some extended effects of symmetry breaking , which are plausible for the deviation from tbm , as well as the experimental accessibility of the model are considered in section iv . in the conclusion ,",
    "the theoretical remarks on the model and an analysis on aspects of deviation from tbm mixing are summarized .",
    "the appendix contains the potential of all scalar particles along with their vacuum expectation values .",
    "the 5 irreducible representations of @xmath4 are @xmath17 while the tensor products of @xmath18 , one of the 1-dim representations , are so trivial that they are simply @xmath19 the tensor products of @xmath20 , the other 1-dim representation , are as follows : @xmath21 in general , the elements of @xmath3 are denoted by @xmath22 or @xmath23 , for @xmath24 and @xmath25 1 to 2 . according to the group theory details for the @xmath4-ii version in ref.@xcite , the product of @xmath3 with another @xmath3 is @xmath26    the su(2 ) lepton doublets @xmath27 , the righthanded charged lepton singlets @xmath28 , and the higgs scalar doublet @xmath29 in the standard model are assigned into such representations of @xmath0 as follows : @xmath30 in the above table , the su(2 ) representation and hypercharge of a field are denoted by the subscription ` @xmath31 ' of the gauge symmetry , and @xmath4 representation and @xmath32 charge of the field are denoted by the subscription ` @xmath33 ' . under flavor symmetry , the charge assignment in eq.([charge_lepton ] ) does not distinguish the @xmath34 flavor from the @xmath35 flavor , because @xmath1 and @xmath2 as well as @xmath36 and @xmath37 are in doublets .",
    "therefore , this @xmath0 symmetry appears as @xmath14 symmetry .    to explain the light neutrino masses , additional higgs scalars , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , and right - handed neutrinos , @xmath40 , are introduced .",
    "their representations under gauge symmetry and flavor symmetry are given in the following table .",
    "@xmath41 the flavor charges of @xmath42 and @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 will be assigned according to the mass type , normal hierarchy or inverted hierarchy . in general , the lagrangian constructed with the leptons and higgs scalars in eq.([charge_lepton ] ) and eq.([charge_nh ] ) can be written as @xmath46 where @xmath47 .",

    "the @xmath0 invariant higgs potential is @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 since the product @xmath54 can be any of the following representations , @xmath55 or @xmath56 of @xmath0 . according to the product rules in eqs .",
    "( [ prod1 ] ) - ( [ prod3 ] ) , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 . the potential in eq .",
    "( [ potentialnh ] ) is symmetric under the interchange of @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "therefore , their vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) are the same , @xmath61 . the vevs @xmath62 and @xmath63 , which are denoted as @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively , will be defined to minimize the potential in eq .",

    ", the dirac mass matrix of the charged leptons from the yukawa couplings , @xmath66 , becomes @xmath67 thus , this flavor model generates a basis where the matrix of charged lepton masses is diagonal .",
    "all the sm particles are @xmath32-even as shown in eq.([charge_lepton ] ) , so that their yukawa couplings are protected from the yukawa couplings with a @xmath32-odd higgs scalar , @xmath68 or @xmath39 .",
    "* minimal model for normal hierarchy * :   in a minimal model where only two sm singlet righthanded neutrinos @xmath42 and @xmath43 are added to the sm fermions , one zero mass eigenvalue is assigned to three active neutrinos . if the charges of right - handed neutrinos @xmath42 and @xmath43 are given as @xmath69 and @xmath70 , then the @xmath0 invariant yukawa couplings give rise to the matrix form : @xmath71 the yukawa coupling @xmath72 is obtained via the tensor product @xmath73 , whereas the coupling @xmath74 is obtained via the tensor product @xmath75 .",
    "thus , the different product rules of the same couplings can cause different sizes in the coupling constants , between a pair of @xmath76 and a pair of @xmath77 .",
    "this model assumes that @xmath78 .    when @xmath79 and @xmath39 obtain their vacuum expectation values to minimize the potential @xmath80 in eq.([potentialnh ] ) , breaking the symmetry @xmath0 , the process to acquire the vevs @xmath81 and @xmath82 are described in eq.([vev_nh ] ) . with the flavor charges of @xmath42 and @xmath43 , the mass matrix of the right - handed neutrinos is diagonal , so that @xmath83 . according to the seesaw mechanism @xmath84 ,",
    "the mass matrix of light neutrinos @xmath85 is @xmath86 where the overall minus sign has been removed by a phase transformation of neutrino fields .",
    "if the masses of light neutrinos have a normal hierarchy , then @xmath87 . if @xmath88 , and the yukawa couplings @xmath89 s are constrained such that @xmath90 and @xmath91 , the mixing matrix of @xmath85 is exactly tbm .",
    "besides , there are a priori conditions for tbm mixing that should be considered . in eq.([md_nh ] ) , the zero element is a key to @xmath92 in pmns , and the opposite sign between the 22 element and 32 element is necessary for @xmath93 .",

    "@xmath92 and @xmath93 are the consequences of @xmath4 symmetry .",
    "however , it is unlikely for a dirac matrix to have exact zero and exact equalities as a coincidence . it will be shown that slight discrepancies between those elements cause physically significant deviation from the tbm mixing matrix .",
    "the non - zero eigenvalues of the light neutrino mass matrix in eq.([mass_nh ] ) are given by @xmath97 and @xmath98 , where @xmath99 and @xmath100 are the factors determined in terms of yukawa coupling constants @xmath101 s .",
    "* minimal model for inverted hierarchy * :   when the charges of righthanded neutrinos @xmath42 and @xmath43 are given as @xmath102 and @xmath70 , then the @xmath0 invariant yukawa couplings give rise to @xmath103 with such charge assignment , the mass matrix of righthanded neutrinos is diagonal ; @xmath104 .",
    "according to the seesaw mechanism @xmath84 , the mass matrix of light neutrinos @xmath85 is @xmath105 where @xmath106 , and @xmath81 .",
    "when taking the seesaw mechanism , the two zero elements in eq.([md_ih ] ) are necessary for @xmath92 , and @xmath107 is necessary for @xmath108 . in other words , the @xmath0 flavor symmetry results in the texture zeros and the equalities , which are the necessary conditions for tbm mixing in pmns .",
    "non - zero eigenvalues of light neutrino mass matrix in eq.([mass_ih ] ) , @xmath109 and @xmath110 , are given by @xmath111 where @xmath99 and @xmath100 can be determined in terms of yukawa coupling constants @xmath101 s .",
    "in addition , possible deviations from those specific elements in dirac mass matrix can cause a phenomenological deviation from tbm mixing in the pmns matrix .",
    "it is necessary to examine the possible aspects that can appear when the zeros and equalities generated by the flavor symmetry are collapsed during symmetry breaking .",
    "therefore , some simple cases will be discussed . in a trial model , it can be assumed to have a right - handed mass matrix as follows : @xmath112 and @xmath99 and @xmath100 , in normal hierarch case or in inverted hierarch case eq.([eigen_ih ] ) , are assumed to be one , for simplicity .",
    "it is unlikely to have an exact equality @xmath113 , or to have an exact zero element , as shown in eq.([md_nh ] ) and eq.([md_ih ] ) , after a series of spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanisms . in order to examine the effects of symmetry breaking to a deviation from low energy tbm mixing matrix ,",
    "the dirac mass matrix for normal hierarchy is assumed to have the following form : @xmath114 where @xmath115 or @xmath116 , and @xmath117 is a small value that can occur from @xmath0-violating yukawa coupling .",
    "the factor @xmath118 is a yukawa coupling ratio that affects the mass ratio at low energy , which can arise from a @xmath119 product weaker than @xmath120 .",
    "the curve ( a ) in fig.1 describes the change in @xmath121 as the ratio @xmath122 varies from 0 to 1.5 for @xmath123 , even though the change in @xmath121 turns out to be independent of @xmath117 . on the other hand ,",
    "the variation in @xmath122 does not cause any change in @xmath124 or @xmath125 .",
    "the curves ( b ) and ( c ) in fig.1 describe the changes in @xmath124 and the change in @xmath125 , respectively , as the ratio @xmath126 varies from 0 to 1 , while keeping @xmath127 . under the given conditions , a range of @xmath122 , @xmath128 ,",
    "can lead to @xmath121 at the 90% cl .",
    "the range of @xmath124 at the 90% cl matches with @xmath129 , while the range of @xmath130 at 90% cl matches with @xmath131 .",
    "the size of @xmath118 does not affect the mixing angles in pmns , but does affect the mass ratios .    for inverted hierarchy , the dirac mass matrix can be supposed to have the following form : @xmath132 where @xmath133 or @xmath116 .",
    "yukawa couplings @xmath134 and @xmath135 are assumed to be very small so that @xmath136 and @xmath137 are much smaller than @xmath65 .",
    "the curve ( a ) in fig.2 describes the change in @xmath121 as the ratio @xmath138 varies from 0 to 1.5 for @xmath113 and @xmath123 . under the given conditions , a range of @xmath138 , @xmath139 ,",
    "can lead to @xmath121 at the 90% cl .",
    "since @xmath65 is the vacuum expectation value of the higgs scalar in the standard model , this model does not cause any new physics below approximately 1 tev .",
    "the curves ( b ) and ( c ) in fig.1 describe the changes in @xmath124 and @xmath125 , respectively , when the 2 - 1 and 3 - 1 elements obtain a non - zero value due to @xmath0-violating coupling , and their relative ratio @xmath140 varies from 0 to 10 . the range of @xmath124 at the 90% cl matches with @xmath141 , whereas the range of @xmath125 at the 90% cl matches with @xmath142 .",
    "a model of lepton masses was constructed in the framework of a discrete flavor symmetry @xmath0 .",
    "each family of sm leptons or each of the right - handed neutrinos , is distinguished from each other by their flavor charges .",
    "however , a pair of @xmath1 and @xmath2 are assigned to the representation @xmath3 of @xmath4 so that they can not be distinguished under the yukawa interaction , and so are a pair of @xmath36 and @xmath37 , indicating @xmath14 symmetry .",
    "when the symmetry is accompanied with @xmath32 symmetry , we can obtain the basis where the mass matrix of charged leptons is diagonal , as shown in eq.([smlepton ] ) .",
    "since the sm particles are all @xmath32-even and the additional scalar particles are @xmath32-odd , there are no extra yukawa couplings of charged leptons found .",
    "the model contains only two righthanded neutrinos so that the couplings with three scalar fields and three lefthanded neutrinos generate a @xmath15 yukawa matrix .",
    "this model can be characterized by a few noteworthy points .",
    "first , the group theoretical properties of @xmath4 gives rise to @xmath14 symmetry , accordingly tbm mixing , and the diagonal mass matrix of charged leptons .",
    "second , the type of neutrino mass spectrum , normal or inverted hierarchy , is resulted in by the flavor symmetry .",

    "third , it is possible to build the mass matrices with a significantly small content of scalar particles under a non - abelian discrete flavor symmetry @xmath0 .",
    "the texture zeros or the equalities due to the symmetry in a yukawa matrix appear to be barely protected , once the symmetry undergoes a chain of breakdown .",
    "it is natural for pmns to obtain a deviation from tbm mixing when the symmetry of the yukawa matrix is broken .",
    "fig.[fig : nh3 ] and fig.[fig : ih3 ] show a schematic diagram of some aspects that can appear in the correlation between the order of symmetry breaking and the deviation from tbm .",
    "ks wishes to thank the members in the physics department at chonnam national university for their warm hospitality .",
    "the @xmath0 invariant higgs potential in eq.([potentialnh ] ) can be rephrased in terms of @xmath143 with @xmath144 and 2 , @xmath39 , and @xmath29 .",
