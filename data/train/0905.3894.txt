    "as noticed already more than 30 years ago by hertz,@xcite quantum phase transitions in correlated fermion systems may be described in terms of the order parameter field alone when one integrates out fermions from the path integral in one stroke and subsequently deals with an exclusively bosonic theory .",

    "[ fig : u_cone_flows ] ( b ) .",
    "the relatively fast compensation of the fermionic contribution to the flow of @xmath66 by bosonic fluctuations , already for small @xmath125 , is caused by the large initial bosonic propagator , @xmath132 , where @xmath133 is rather small .",
    "note that the rescaled variables @xmath96 , @xmath98 , and @xmath97 start from infinite initial values at @xmath134 , which is simply due to the initial value of the bosonic @xmath83-factor , @xmath57 .",
    "the corresponding unscaled variables are finite and the flow is therefore well defined .",

    "the model is a prototype for systems for which the hertz - millis approach to quantum phase transitions in itinerant fermi systems is not applicable , since integrating out the fermions leads to a singular landau - ginzburg functional . using the functional rg framework , we have derived coupled flow equations for the gapless fermionic degrees of freedom and the bosonic order parameter fluctuations .",
    "fermions and bosons acquire anomalous dimensions at the qcp in dimensions @xmath151 . consequently ,",
    "both the fermion and the order parameter propagators are non - analytic functions of frequency and momentum . in two dimensions , the fermionic self - energy scales as @xmath152 at low frequencies , implying the absence of fermionic quasi - particles and non - fermi liquid behavior .",
    "we have also computed the susceptibility and the correlation length exponents when approaching the qcp along the control parameter axis .",
    "the strong impact of the gapless fermions on the order parameter interaction spoils the hertz - millis approach to quantum phase transitions , which is based on the landau - ginzburg paradigm .",
    "the fermionic anomalous dimension @xmath102 influences critical exponents in a way that resembles the interplay of fermions and bosons in the gross - neveu model.@xcite recently , the gross - neveu model has been proposed as an effective field theory describing the quantum phase transition between a semimetal and an antiferromagnetic insulator for _ repulsively _ interacting electrons on the two - dimensional honeycomb lattice .",
    "@xcite    in the present work we have focussed on ground state properties , but an extension to finite temperatures should be straightforward .",
    "in particular , the quantum critical regime above the qcp in the @xmath153-plane could be studied with the same truncation of the functional rg hierarchy .",
    "another interesting extension would be the inclusion of the pseudo spin structure necessary to describe the dirac dispersion of fermions on the honeycomb lattice .",
    "our work may also serve as a guideline for the study of more complex quantum phase transitions in itinerant systems , for which the hertz - millis approach is not applicable , or at least questionable , such as certain magnetic transitions in low dimensions ."
