    "@xmath2 is one of the most important ternary iii - v compound semiconductors .",
    "its bandgap covers both the 1.3 and 1.55 @xmath3 range , which are the preferred wavelengths in long distance fiber communications[1,2 ] .",
    "however , long - wavelength photonic devices based on lattice - matched @xmath4as / inp heterostructures suffer from strong auger recombination and intervalence band absorption processes[7 - 10 ] .",
    "recently , to improve the performance of long - wavelength semiconductor lasers , long wavelength(@xmath5 m ) @xmath2 quantum - wire ( qwr ) lasers have been grown by a single step molecular beam epitaxy technique[1 ] .",
    "it is found that the qwr laser structures are a promising choice because of the many predicted benefits , such as higher gain , reduced temperature sensitivity , higher modulation bandwidths , and narrower spectral linewidths[2 ] .",
    "short - period superlattices ( sps ) in the direction perpendicular to the growth direction can be formed via the strain - induced lateral - layer ordering ( silo ) process[1,2 ] .",
    "a quantum wire heterostructure can then be created by simply utilizing this sps structure as the quantum well region in a conventional quantum heterostructure .",
    "besides the self - assembled lateral ordering , it is believed that the strain also plays a key role[2 ] in the temperature stability and high anisotropy for the qwr laser structure .",
    "recent studies indicate that the use of the strained - layer quantum wire heterostructure has advantages of high - quality interfaces and band - gap tuning which are independent of the lattice constant of the constituent materials[3,4,6 ] .",
    "furthermore , much work has been undertaken which predicts that by using strained - layer superlattice to form the active region of a quantum - wire laser , the threshold current can be decreased by one order of magnitude , and the optical loss due to intervalence - band absorption and auger recombination will also be greatly reduced[1,2,7 - 10 ] .",
    "also , the temperature sensitivity is reduced by a order of magnitude compared with strain - free structures[2 ] . a typical temperature sensitivity of the lasing wavelength is(@xmath6 ) for the usual gainas / inp lasers . by using a distributed - feedback structure ,",
    "the temperature dependence of the lasing wavelength is reduced to @xmath7[2 ] . with this strained gainas qwr ,",
    "the dependence is smaller than @xmath8[2 ]",
    ". it should be an important improvement on the current technology in fabricating the long wavelength lasers for fiber communication . in this paper",
    "we study the effects of multi - axial strain on the electronic and optical properties of the qwr structures grown via the silo process . through this study",
    ", we can gain a better understanding of the strain engineering of qwr structures suitable for the application of fiber - optical communication .    in the experiment performed by chou et al[1 ] , the qwr active region",
    "is created @xmath9 by the silo process within the @xmath10 sps regions .",
    "the silo process generates a strong ga / in lateral composition modulation and creates in - rich @xmath2 lateral qws in the [ 110 ] direction . by sandwiching the in composition modulated layer ( with @xmath11 varying from 0.3 to 0.7 ) between @xmath12 barrier layers ,",
    "a strained qwr heterostructure is formed[1,2 ] .",
    "the model qwr structure considered in the present paper is depicted in figure.1 .",
    "the central region consists of the in composition modulated @xmath2 layer ( a / b / a / b ... ) , in which the a strip is ga - rich while the b strip is in - rich .",
    "the lateral period is @xmath13 . in our calculation , we consider @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "we consider two cases of composition modulation . in case one",
    ", the ga composition changes abruptly with @xmath16 in strip a and @xmath17 in strip b. in case two , @xmath11 varies sinusoidally from 0.6 ( or 0.7 ) at the center of strip a to 0.4 ( or 0.3 ) at the center of strip b ( with @xmath18 at the border between a and b strips ) .",
    "the method used in this paper for calculating the strained quantum well band structure is based on the effective bond - orbital model ( ebom ) .",
    "a detailed description of this method without the effect of strain has been published elsewhere[5 ] . here",
    "we give a brief account of the method and discuss the effect of strains .",
    "the effective bond - orbital model employed here is a tight - binding - like model which includes nearest - neighbor interactions among bond orbital residing on an fcc lattice .",
    "the version of the ebom used in this calculations describes the coupling between the upper four spin-3/2 valence bands and the lowest two s - like conduction bands . for our qwr system ,",
    "the split - off bands are ignored since the spin - orbital splitting is large .",
    "a bond orbital is defined to be the proper linear combination of the two atomic orbitals within a zinc - blende crystal which best describes the states near the center of the brillouin zone . the parameters that appear in the theory are given by a correspondence which is made by requiring that the hamiltonian in the bond - orbital basis , when written for the bulk material and expanded to the second order in @xmath19 , agree with the luttinger - kohn expression . for interactions across heterojunctions , we take the average of the matrix elements for the two bulk materials .",
    "ebom has been successfully applied to the calculation of electronic states of superlattices[5 ] , strained - layer superlattices [ 6,19 ] , semiconductor quantum wires[15 ] and dots[17 ] , and impurity levels in quantum dots[17 ] and quantum wells[17 ] . here",
    ", we apply it to this multi - axially strained qwr structures .",
    "we solve the qwr electronic states according to a procedure similar to that described in [ 15 ] .",
    "we first calculate the band structure of a superlattice(sl ) with m bilayers of @xmath20 ( the well material ) and n bilayers of @xmath12 ( the barrier material ) using the slab method .",
    "the superlattice period is @xmath21= ( m+n)a/2 , where a is the lattice constant . for a sufficiently large value of the barrier thickness ( we used @xmath22 ) the qw s",
    "are essentially decoupled and we ignore the dependence on the wave number in the growth direction , taking @xmath23 .",
    "the sl eigenstates with @xmath24 are denoted by @xmath25 , i.e , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the hamiltonian for the @xmath28/@xmath12 sl ( @xmath29 ) , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the two components of the sl in - plane wave vector along and perpendicular to the qwr axis , respectively .",
    "@xmath30 is a good quantum number for the qwr array , while @xmath32 is not .",
    "the qwr wave function is a linear combination of sl wave functions with the same @xmath30 but with values of @xmath32 differing by 2@xmath33 .",
    "we define @xmath31 to be the wave number of the qwr array in the [ 110 ] direction , and we can write @xmath34 with @xmath35 m , where @xmath36 with @xmath37 .",
    "the qwr hamiltonian is @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is treated as a perturbation .",
    "the hamiltonian matrix for qwr @xmath40    is then diagonalized in the basis consisting of sl eigenstates .",
    "the basis is truncated to reduce the computer time , thus making the method a variational one .",
    "the subbands closest to the band edge are converged to within 0.1 mev .",
    "the size of the hamiltonian matrix , originally given by the number of sites in a qwr supercell times the number of coupled bands , is now reduced to the number of sl states necessary to give accurate results for the qwr of concern . in our case , this number needed to get well converged results for the two uppermost pair of valence subbands is around 200 .",
    "however , we have used @xmath41 basis states in order to ensure the accuracy of the deeper lying sates for all calculations in this present paper . the effect of lateral intermixing of ga and in is accounted for by using the virtual - crystal approximation .",
    "bond - orbital parameters for the inter - diffused materials are obtained by linearly interpolating between the values of the parameters for the pure materials .",
    "the optical parameters in these expressions are determined by requiring that the optical matrix elements between bulk states obtained by ebom be identical to those obtained in the @xmath42 theory up to second order in @xmath19[15 ] .",
    "the effect of strain is included by adding a strain hamiltonian @xmath43 to the ebom effective hamiltonian[6,10,16 ] .",
    "the matrix elements of @xmath43 in the bond - orbital basis can be obtained by the deformation - potential theory of bir and pikus[16 ] .",
    "here , we consider the combination of two bi - axial strains , one in the ( 001 ) plane ( due to the lattice mismatch at the interfaces between gainas and algainas ) and the other in the ( 110 ) plane ( due to the ga composition modulation ) .",
    "the resulting strains in the sl layers consist of both hydrostatic and uniaxial components . for case 1 ( ga composition changes abruptly from region a to region",
    "b ) , the lattice constant of the strained layers in the [ 001 ] direction ( @xmath44 ) is given by minimizing the free energy of the fcc system due to strain[11 ] : @xmath45 where @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) is the lateral layer thickness and @xmath48 is the strain tensor in the ga - rich ( in - rich ) region .",
    "@xmath49 s ( @xmath50 s ) are the elastic constants for the ga - rich ( in - rich ) materials .",
    "here we have used a rotated cartesian coordinates in which @xmath51 , y'=[110],$ ] and @xmath52 $ ] .",
    "a constraint @xmath53 has been imposed to keep the @xmath12 barrier strain free , since it is lattice - matched to the inp substrate[1,2 ] , where @xmath54 is the in - plane strained lattice constant ( perpendicular to [ 001 ] axis ) for material @xmath55 .",
    "the multi - axial strain caused by the lattice - mismatch in both ( 001 ) and ( 110 ) planes is simply @xmath56 where @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) is the unstrained lattice constant of @xmath20 ( @xmath59 ) ( @xmath60 for case 1 ) and @xmath61 with @xmath62 for @xmath63 .",
    "the minimization procedure leads to @xmath64 which is the strained lattice constant in the [ 001 ] direction",
    ".    due to symmetry , the multi - axial strain tensor is diagonal in the @xmath65 coordinates , which leads to a diagonal strain hamiltonian @xmath66 where @xmath67 the strain potential on the s states is given by[6 ] @xmath68 the strain hamiltonian in the bond - orbital basis @xmath69 can be easily found by using the coupling constants[5 ] , i.e , @xmath70 the elastic constants @xmath71 and @xmath72 for gaas , inas and alas can be found in ref .",
    ". the deformation potentials@xmath73 can be found in ref.[20,21 ] .",
    "the linear interpolation and virtual crystal approximation is used to obtain the corresponding parameters for the gainas and algainas .    after rotating back to the original cartesian coordinates",
    ", the final results for the strain hamiltonian in the bond - orbital basis @xmath69 is @xmath74 with @xmath75 one can see non - diagonal terms arise due to the rotation , which will cause additional mixing and optic transitions between different valence bands .",
    "the above strain hamiltonian is derived for case one only , where the ga composition ( @xmath11 ) changes abruptly from region a to region b. for case two , @xmath11 varies continuously from @xmath76 to @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) . in this case , we shall first calculate the strain hamiltonian for the abrupt case to get @xmath79 and @xmath80 , using eq .",
    "we then obtain the strain hamiltonian at any atomic layer with ga composition @xmath11 via a linear interpolation between @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "this is consistent in spirit with the virtual crystal approximation we have used for obtaining the interaction parameters in ebom .",
    "in figure 2 , we show a schematic diagram indicating the alignment between band edges of the constituent materials for qwr in case 1 ( square profile ) with and without the effect of strain . all energies are measured with respect to the bulk inas valence band edge .",
    "this diagram is useful in understanding the quantum confinement effect on the qwrs considered here . from figure 2",
    ", we notice that the strain [ in particular , the one in the ( 110 ) plane ] has a significant effect on the band alignment .",
    "take figure 2(a ) for example , without strain ( solid lines ) the conduction ( valence ) band of ga@xmath81in@xmath82as is below ( above ) that of ga@xmath82in@xmath81as by 247 mev ( 14 mev ) .",
    "with strain ( dotted lines ) , the situation is reversed and the conduction ( valence ) band of ga@xmath81in@xmath82as is above ( below ) that of ga@xmath82in@xmath81as by 312 mev ( 76 mev ) ; thus , both electrons and holes will be confined in the ga - rich region of the qwr .",
    "we found that about 80 % of these changes are caused by the strain in the ( 110 ) plane , since there is a stronger lattice mismatch between ga@xmath82in@xmath81as and ga@xmath81in@xmath82as compared with that between ga@xmath82in@xmath81as and al@xmath83ga@xmath83in@xmath84as ( or inp ) .",
    "the strain also causes a splitting between the heavy - hole ( hh ) and light - hole ( lh ) bands with the lh band lying above the hh band .",
    "however , the splitting is rather small , about 3 mev in ga@xmath82in@xmath81as .",
    "when the confinement effect due to the barrier material ( al@xmath83ga@xmath83in@xmath84as ) is included , the hh band again lies above the lh band , due the difference in the effective masses along the growth direction ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "the dash - dotted lines in figure 2(a ) indicate the superlattice band edges of 50ga@xmath82in@xmath81as ( or ga@xmath81in@xmath82as ) sandwiched between 50al@xmath83ga@xmath83in@xmath84as barriers .",
    "the difference in superlattice band edges ( dash - dotted lines ) between ga@xmath82in@xmath81as and ga@xmath81in@xmath82as determines the degree of lateral quantum confinement in the qwr . for the present case ,",
    "the conduction - band offset is 252 mev and the valence - band ( for hh only ) offset is 52 mev , as far as the lateral confinement is concerned .",
    "both offsets are large enough to give rise to strong lateral confinement for electrons and holes in the ga - rich region .",
    "figure 3 shows the near zone - center valence subband structures of square - shaped qwrs with the multi - axial strain with ( a ) ga composition ( @xmath11 ) changing abruptly from 0.6 in region a to 0.4 in region b and ( b)ga composition ( @xmath11 ) changing abruptly from 0.7 in region a to 0.3 in region b. to compare with experiment[1,2 ] , we choose material parameters appropriate for temperature at 77k[12 ] .",
    "all subbands are two - fold degenerate due to the kramer s degeneracy and they are labeled according to the characters of their underlying bloch functions at the zone - center : hh for heavy hole and lh for light - hole ( only the confined subbands are labeled ) .",
    "the conduction subbands are approximately parabolic as usual with a zone - center subband minimum equal to 826 mev in ( a ) and 707 mev in ( b ) ( not shown in the figure ) .",
    "this gives an energy gap 860 mev for the ( x=0.6/0.4 ) qwr array and 708 mev for the ( x=0.7/0.3 ) qwr array .    the observed c1-hh1 excitonic transition is at 735 mev ( or 1.65@xmath3 ) for the qwr[1,2 ] at 77k . in comparing the band gaps with the experiment",
    ", one should also take into account the exciton binding energy which is around 20 mev for this size of qwr .",
    "thus , the theoretical result for the ( x=0.7/0.3 ) qwr array is in closer agreement with experiment , but about 50 mev too low .",
    "comparing the band structures in both @xmath30 ( @xmath86 $ ] ) and @xmath31 ( @xmath87 $ ] ) directions , we noticed an apparent anisotropy in the energy dispersion .",
    "the dispersions in the @xmath31 direction for the five uppermost ( confined ) valence bands are rather small , indicating strong lateral confinement .",
    "we observe strong anti - crossing effect between the hh1/hh2 and lh1 subband at @xmath30 near @xmath88 similar to what happens in a quantum well @xcite . here",
    "the hh2 subband of the qwr corresponds to the [ 110 ] zone - folded part of the hh1 subband of the quantum well ( the envelope function has odd parity in the [ 110 ] direction but even parity in the @xmath86 $ ] direction ) .",
    "the subbands in figure 3(b ) have less dispersion in the @xmath31 direction compared with those in figure 3(a ) as a result of stronger lateral confinement .",
    "this is caused by the larger band discontinuities in the x=0.3/0.7 case ( versus the x=0.4/0.6 case ) as can be seen by comparing band alignments shown in figure 2 .",
    "figure 4 shows the near zone - center valence subband structures of a qwr with a sinusoidal lateral modulation with ga composition ( @xmath11 ) varying as the position ( @xmath89 ) in the [ 110 ] direction between two extreme values @xmath76 and @xmath77 , i.e. @xmath90 for @xmath91 and ( b ) @xmath92 . in this case , the hamiltonian including the multi - axial strain is calculated with a linear extroplation between the hamiltonians for the maximum and minimum ga composition , i.e. @xmath93 where @xmath91 or 0.3 and @xmath94 is determined by comparing the ga composition on both sides of the equation @xmath95 or @xmath96 .",
    "the conduction band minimum ( not shown ) is 850 mev ( 757 mev ) for the case @xmath91 ( @xmath92 ) , which corresponds to a band gap of 889 mev ( 767 mev ) . subtracting the exciton binding energy ( @xmath97 20 mev ) from the band gap",
    ", we found that the @xmath92 case is in fairly good agreement with the observed excitonic transition energy of 735 mev .",
    "the band gaps of qwr s with the sinusoidal profile are consistently larger ( by about 30 - 50 mev ) than the corresponding qwr s with the square - profile ( with the same extreme values of ga composition ) .",
    "the sinusoidal variation in ga composition gives rise to more energy , since the well region contains more materials with band gap higher than the minimum in comparison with the square - profile .",
    "furthermore , the lateral strain is reduced ( less mismatch on the average ) which also tend to increase the band gap .    comparing figure 4 with figure 3",
    ", we notice that the spacing between hh1 and hh2 is substantially larger for the sinusoidal profile than for the square profile .",
    "this can be understood by the following argument .",
    "the envelope function for the hh2 state is more spread out than that for the hh1 state , thus its energy is increased more in the sinusoidal profile ( with higher probability being in materials with higher band gap ) compared with the square profile .",
    "next we discuss the optical properties of qwr s . since the qwr states can be qualitatively viewed as the zone - folded states of the superlattice ( sl ) states ( the zeroth - order states ) via the lateral confinement , it is instructive to examine the optical matrix elements of the sl case . figure 5 shows the squared optical matrix elements of the ( 50/50 ) ga@xmath98in@xmath99as / al@xmath83ga@xmath83in@xmath84as superlattice for the hh1-c1 and lh1-c1 transitions versus the wave vector @xmath31 .",
    "the solid and dashed lines are for the polarization vector along the @xmath30 ( @xmath100 $ ] ) and @xmath31 ( [ 110 ] ) directions , respectively .",
    "we note that the optical matrix elements are isotropic in the @xmath11-@xmath101 plane at the zone - center , while they become anisotropic at finite values of @xmath31 . at the zone center ,",
    "the hh state consists of bloch states with atomic character @xmath102 ( @xmath103 ) , while the lh state consists of bloch states with atomic character @xmath104 ( @xmath105 ) ; thus , the corresponding optical transitions ( to an s - like conduction band state ) are isotropic in the @xmath11-@xmath101 plane . here",
    "@xmath106 is the coordinate along the @xmath107 direction . for finite @xmath31 ,",
    "the hh and lh characters are mixed , with the hh state consisting of more @xmath108-character than @xmath89-character , thus in favor of the polarization vector parallel to the @xmath30 direction .",
    "note that the hh ( lh ) band tends to have an atomic character with polarization perpendicular ( parallel ) to the direction of wave vector .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the fact that the ( @xmath109 ) interaction is weaker that the ( @xmath110 ) interaction in a tight - binding model .",
    "since qwr states are derived from the sl states with finite values of @xmath31 , we expect the optical matrix elements of qwr to be anisotropic in the @xmath11-@xmath101 plane as well .    figures 6 and 7 show the squared optical matrix elements versus wave vectors of the corresponding qwr s considered in figures 3 and 4 , respectively . respectively .",
    "the solid and dashed lines are for the polarization vector along the @xmath30 ( @xmath100 $ ] ) ( parallel to the wire ) and @xmath31 ( [ 110 ] ) ( perpendicular to the wire ) directions .",
    "the optical matrix elements together with the subband structures discussed above provide the essential ingredients for understanding the optical transitions observed in the photoluminescence ( pl ) measurements .",
    "in all figures the optical transitions considered are from the topmost three valence subbands to the lowest conduction subband : hh1-c1 , hh2-c1 , and lh1-c1 .",
    "these curves were obtained by summing the contributions of two degenerate subbands ( due to kramer s degeneracy ) for the initial and final states . to compare with experimental ( pl ) results , we concentrate on the hh1-c1 transition .    from figures 6 and 7 , we found for the parallel polarization ( solid lines ) , the squared optical matrix element for the hh1-c1 transition has a maximum at the zone center with a value near 25 ev and remains close to this maximum value for all finite @xmath31 and with @xmath111 .",
    "for the perpendicular polarization , the hh1-c1 transition is very small for finite @xmath31 and @xmath111 .",
    "this means that the wave function of the hh1 state has mostly @xmath108 character ( and some @xmath85 character ) .",
    "thus , we conclude that the strong lateral confinement forces the wave function of the hh1 state with @xmath111 to change from the @xmath112 character ( in the sl case ) into mostly @xmath108 character . at finite @xmath30",
    ", the character of the hh1 state gradually changes back toward the @xmath112 character and the optical transition becomes almost isotropic when @xmath30 is comparable to zone - boundary value of @xmath113 , and finally turns into mostly @xmath89 character as @xmath30 becomes much larger than @xmath114 .",
    "the anti - crossing behavior of the hh1/hh2 subbands with the lh1 subband further complicates the whole picture at @xmath115 .",
    "the hh2-c1 transition has zero optical strength at the zone center for both polarizations .",
    "this is expected , since the hh2 state has odd parity in the envelope function , which leads to forbidden transition at the zone center .",
    "the symmetry restriction is relaxed as the wave vector deviate from zero .",
    "the lh1-c1 transition has large optical strength ( around 17 ev ) for the perpendicular polarization and very weak strength ( around 1 ev ) for the parallel polarization at the zone center .",
    "this indicates that the lh1 states consists of mostly @xmath89 character .",
    "so the strong lateral confinement forces the the wave function of the lh1 state with @xmath111 to change from the @xmath116 character ( in the sl case ) into mostly @xmath89 character . in other words , the hh1 state",
    "( with pure @xmath112 character ) and lh1 state ( with pure @xmath116 character ) in the sl case are mixed thoroughly by the lateral confinement in qwr to produce a predominantly @xmath108 state ( hh1 ) and a predominantly @xmath89 ( lh1 ) state .",
    "note that all thse states consist of appreciable @xmath85 character , which will appear in the optical transition with @xmath85 polarization .    to calculate the anisotropy , we integrate the squared optical matrix element over range of @xmath30 corresponding to the spread of exciton envelope function in the @xmath30 space .",
    "the exciton envelope funtion is obtained by solving the 1d schrding equation for the exciton in the effective - mass approximation @xmath117f(x')=e_x f(x'),\\ ] ] where @xmath118 is the exciton reduced mass ( @xmath119 ) and @xmath120 is the effective 1d exciton potential given by@xcite @xmath121 the parameter @xmath122 is obtained by extropolation from the values given in table v of ref .",
    "@xcite . for a @xmath123 quantum wire ,",
    "we obtain @xmath124 .",
    "( 10 ) is solved numerically , and the exciton envelope function in @xmath30 space is obtained via the fourier transform of @xmath125 .",
    "the exciton binding energy obtained is 23 mev .",
    "we found that the ratio of the averaged optical strength for the hh1-c1 transition for the parallel to perpendicular component of the polarization vector is 2.65 ( 4.04 ) for the @xmath126 ( @xmath127 ) qwr with square profile , and 2.86 ( 7.19 ) for the @xmath91 ( @xmath92 ) qwr with sinusoidal profile .",
    "the @xmath92 case shows stronger optical anisotropy than the @xmath91 case , indicating that the stronger lateral confinement leads to stronger optical anisotropy as expected .",
    "experimentally , the optical anisotropy is found to be around 2 - 4 .",
    "so , our results are consistent with experiment .",
    "we have calculated the band structures and optical matrix elements for the strained qwr grown by the silo method .",
    "the effect of multi - axial strain on the valence subbands and optical matrix elements is discussed .",
    "our theoretical studies provide the explanation of the anisotropy in optical matrix elements of these qwr s observed experimentally .",
    "we find that the biaxial strain due to the lattice mismatch between the ga - rich and in - rich regions is most dominant .",
    "it tends to increase the lateral confinement in the qwr and enhances the anisotropy of the optical transitions which may be useful for certain applications in optical communication .",
    "we also calculated the effect of lateral composition modulation on the band structures and optical properties and find that it increases the band gaps and reduces the optical anisotropy . from the above discussions , we can use the theoretical predictions to guide the engineering design of qwr optical devices .",
