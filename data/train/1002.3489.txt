    "quiescent solar filaments are clouds of cool and dense plasma suspended against gravity by forces though to be of magnetic origin .",
    "they form along the inversion polarity line in or between the weak remnants of active regions .",
    "early filament observations already revealed that their fine structure is apparently composed by many horizontal and thin dark threads @xcite .",
    "more recent high - resolution h@xmath0 observations obtained with the swedish solar telescope ( sst ) in la palma @xcite and the dutch open telescope ( dot ) in tenerife @xcite have allowed to observe this fine structure with much greater detail ( see @xcite , for a review ) .",
    "the measured average width of resolved thin threads is about @xmath1 arc.sec ( @xmath2 @xmath3 km ) while their length is between @xmath4 and @xmath5 arc.sec ( @xmath2 3500 - 28000 km ) .",
    "the fine threads of solar filaments seem to be partially filled with cold plasma @xcite , typically two orders of magnitude denser and cooler than the surrounding corona , and it is generally assumed that they outline their magnetic flux tubes @xcite .",
    "this idea is strongly supported by observations which suggest that they are inclined with respect to the filament long axis in a similar way to what has been found for the magnetic field ( @xcite ) . on the opposite ,",
    "@xcite suggest that these dark horizontal filament fibrils are a projection effect . according to this view ,",
    "many magnetic field dips of rather small vertical extension , but filled with cool plasma , would be aligned in the vertical direction and the projection against the disk would produce the impression of a horizontal thread .    oscillations in prominences and filaments are a commonly observed phenomenon .",
    "they are usually classified , in terms of their amplitude , as small and large amplitude oscillations @xcite .",
    "this paper is concerned with small amplitude oscillations .",
    "large amplitude oscillations have been recently reviewed by @xcite .",
    "it is well established that these small amplitude periodic changes are of local nature .",
    "the detected peak velocity ranges from the noise level ( down to 0.1 km  s@xmath6 in some cases ) to 23  km  s@xmath6 , although larger values have also been reported @xcite .",
    "two - dimensional observations of filaments @xcite revealed that individual fibrils or groups of fibrils may oscillate independently with their own periods , which range between 3 and 20 minutes .",
    "more recently , @xcite reports spatially coherent oscillations found over slices of a polar crown filament covering an area of @xmath7 arc.sec@xmath8 with , among other , a significant periodicity at 26 minutes , strongly damped after 4 periods .",
    "furthermore , @xcite have shown evidence about traveling waves along a number of filament threads with an average phase velocity of @xmath9 km s@xmath6 , a wavelength of @xmath10 ( @xmath11  km ) , and oscillatory periods of the individual threads that vary from @xmath12 to @xmath13 minutes .",
    "oscillatory events have been reported from both ground - based observations @xcite , as well as observations from instruments onboard space - crafts , such as soho @xcite and hinode @xcite .",
    "the observed periodic signals are mainly detected from doppler velocity measurements and can therefore be associated to the transverse displacement of the fine structures @xcite .",
    "extensive reviews on small amplitude oscillations in prominences can be found in @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "small amplitude oscillations in quiescent filaments have been interpreted in terms of magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) waves @xcite , which has allowed to develop the theoretical models ( see @xcite , for recent reviews ) . models of filament threads usually represent them as part of a larger magnetic flux tube , whose foot - points are anchored in the solar photosphere @xcite .",
    "early works studying filament thread oscillations have considered the mhd eigenmodes supported by a filament thread modeled as a cartesian slab , partially filled with prominence plasma , and embedded in the corona @xcite .",
    "these works were later extended by considering a more representative cylindrical geometry by @xcite .",
    "these authors found that the fundamental transverse fast mode is always confined in the dense part of the flux tube , hence , for an oscillating cylindrical filament thread , it should be difficult to induce oscillations in adjacent threads , unless they are very close .",
    "groups of multithread structures and their collective oscillations have been modeled by @xcite in cartesian geometry and by @xcite in cylindrical geometry .",
    "time and spatial damping is a recurrently observed characteristic of small amplitude prominence oscillations .",
    "observational evidence for the damping of small amplitude oscillations in prominences can be found in @xcite , and more recently in @xcite .",
    "these observational studies have allowed to obtain some characteristic spatial and time scales .",
    "reliable values for the damping time have been derived , from different doppler velocity time series , by @xcite and @xcite , in prominences , and by @xcite in filaments .",
    "the values thus obtained are usually between 1 and 4 times the corresponding period , and large regions of prominences / filaments display similar damping times .",
    "several theoretical mechanisms have been proposed in order to explain the observed damping .",
    "@xcite estimated , through order of magnitude calculations , that several isotropic and anisotropic dissipative mechanisms , such as viscosity , magnetic diffusivity , radiative losses and thermal conduction can not in general explain the observed wave damping .",
    "linear non - adiabatic mhd waves have been studied by @xcite .",
    "the overall conclusion from these studies is that thermal mechanisms can only account for the damping of slow waves in an efficient manner , while fast waves remain almost undamped .",
    "since prominences can be considered as partially ionized plasmas , a possible mechanism to damp fast waves ( as well as alfvn waves ) could come from ion - neutral collisions @xcite , although the ratio of the damping time to the period does not completely match the observations . besides non - ideal mechanisms ,",
    "another possibility to attenuate fast waves in thin filament threads comes from resonant wave damping ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "this phenomenon is well studied for transverse kink waves in coronal loops ( @xcite ) and provides a plausible explanation for quickly damped transverse loop oscillations first observed by trace ( @xcite ) .",
    "the time scales of damping produced by these different mechanisms should be compared with those obtained from observations .",
    "the theoretical approach of many works studying the damping of prominence oscillations has been to first study a given damping mechanism in simplified uniform and unbounded media thereafter introducing structuring and non - uniformity .",
    "this has led to an increasing complexity of theoretical models in such a way that some of them now combine different damping mechanisms .",
    "this paper presents results from recent theoretical studies on small amplitude oscillations in prominences and their damping .",
    "this topic has been the theme of several recent review works , see e.g. @xcite and @xcite , a fact that reflects the liveliness of the subject .",
    "here we extend these works by reporting the last studies and mainly focusing on the theory of damping mechanisms for oscillations in prominences and its application to prominence seismology , a discipline in a rapidly developing stage , as better observations and more accurate theoretical models become available .",
    "in a seminal paper , @xcite studied the thermal instability of a dilute gas in mechanical and thermal equilibrium . using this approach , the time and spatial damping of magnetohydrodynamic waves in unbounded media @xcite and in bounded slabs @xcite with physical properties akin to those of quiescent solar prominences , as well as in slabs having prominence - corona physical properties",
    "@xcite have been studied .",
    "furthermore , the behavior of non - adiabatic waves in an isolated and flowing prominence fine structure @xcite has also been considered .",
    "all these investigations have been already reviewed in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "for this reason , in the following we concentrate in a recent investigation about the time damping of linear non - adiabatic mhd waves in a multi - thread prominence when mass flows are also present .      in an attempt to explain the observations about in - phase oscillations of large areas of a filament reported by @xcite",
    ", @xcite studied the collective oscillations of a set of inhomogeneous threads in cartesian geometry .",
    "the configuration was made of five unequally separated threads having different widths and densities , while the magnetic field keeps the same strength everywhere .",
    "when realistic separations between threads are considered , the system oscillates with the only non - leaky mode , and oscillations are in phase with similar amplitudes and with a frequency smaller than that of the densest thread .",
    "although these results show some agreement with observations , the use of cartesian geometry favors collective oscillations since the transversal velocity perturbation has a very long tail which allows for an easy interaction between neighboring threads .",
    "however , @xcite also pointed out that , after four periods , the oscillations were strongly damped in time and that simultaneously flowing and oscillatory structures were also present in filament threads . to model this situation ,",
    "@xcite have used the t - matrix theory of scattering to study the propagation of non - adiabatic magnetoacoustic waves in an arbitrary system of cylindrical threads when material flows inside them are present . in this study ,",
    "the effects of radiative losses , thermal conduction and heating have been taken into account , mass flows along magnetic field lines have been allowed , and the general case @xmath14 has been considered .",
    "the equilibrium system is made of two homogeneous and unlimited parallel cylinders , prominence threads , embedded in an also homogeneous and unbounded coronal medium ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] ) . for the study ,",
    "two different configurations have been chosen .      in this case",
    "the same typical values of prominence density and temperature have been used for both threads , as well as typical coronal values for the external density and temperature .",
    "furthermore , the magnetic field strength is the same everywhere . in the absence of flow , four fast kink modes , already found by @xcite when studying the collective oscillations of two coronal loops ,",
    "are present .",
    "these modes are named as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote symmetry or antisymmetry of the velocity field inside the tubes with respect to the ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) plane and the subscripts refer to the main direction of polarization of motions .",
    "in addition to the kink modes , two further fundamental collective wave modes , one symmetric ( @xmath20 ) and one antisymmetric ( @xmath21 ) , mainly polarized along the @xmath19-direction and corresponding to slow modes have been identified .",

    "adapted from @xcite.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    figure  [ fig : distkink]a displays the ratio of the real part of the frequency of the four kink solutions to the frequency of the individual kink mode @xcite , @xmath22 , as a function of the distance between the center of cylinders , @xmath23 .",
    "it can be seen that the smaller the distance between centers , the larger the interaction between threads and the separation between frequencies .",
    "the frequency of collective kink modes is almost identical to the individual kink frequency for a distance between threads larger than 6 or 7 radii .",
    "therefore , we expect the collective behavior of oscillations to be stronger when the threads are closer . on the opposite , for larger distances",
    ", the interaction between threads is much weaker and individual oscillations are expected .",
    "furthermore , figure  [ fig : distkink]b shows the ratio of the damping time to the period , @xmath24 , of the four kink modes as a function of @xmath23 .",
    "this ratio appears to be very large suggesting that dissipation by non - adiabatic mechanisms is not very efficient to damp the fast kink modes which could be responsible of observed filament threads oscillations .         in the case of slow modes ,",
    "figure  [ fig : distslow]a displays the ratio of the real part of the frequency of the @xmath20 and @xmath21 solutions to the frequency of the individual slow mode , @xmath25 .",
    "it can be seen that the frequencies of the @xmath20 and @xmath21 modes are almost identical to the individual slow mode frequency , and the strength of the interaction is almost independent of the distance between cylinders .",
    "this is in agreement with the fact that transverse motions ( responsible for the interaction between threads ) are not significant for slow - like modes in comparison with their longitudinal motions .",
    "therefore , the @xmath20 and @xmath21 modes essentially behave as individual slow modes , contrary to kink modes , which display a more significant collective behavior . finally , figure  [ fig : distslow]b shows @xmath26 corresponding to the @xmath20 and @xmath21 solutions versus @xmath23 .",
    "slow modes are efficiently attenuated by non - adiabatic mechanisms , with @xmath27 , which is in agreement with previous studies @xcite and consistent with observations .",
    "next , the effect of flows on the behavior of collective modes has been studied .",
    "arbitrary flows have been assumed in both cylinders while coronal flows have been neglected .",
    "first of all , we concentrate on transverse modes .",
    "we denote the flow in the first cylinder by @xmath28 , setting its value to @xmath29  km  s@xmath6 , and we study the behavior of the oscillatory frequency when the flow in the second cylinder , denoted by @xmath30 , varies ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : phase ] ) .",
    "since frequencies are almost degenerate , we follow the notation of @xcite and call low - frequency modes the @xmath31 and @xmath32 solutions , while high - frequency modes refer to @xmath33 and @xmath34 solutions .",
    "we have restricted ourselves to parallel propagation although the argumentation can be easily extended to anti - parallel waves . in order to understand the asymptotic behavior of frequencies in figure  [",
    "fig : phase ] , we define the following doppler - shifted individual kink frequencies : @xmath35 @xmath36 where the @xmath37 signs arise because of the performed fourier analysis of the form @xmath38 . since @xmath28 is fixed , @xmath39 is a horizontal line in figure  [ fig : phase ] , whereas @xmath40 is linear with @xmath30 .    , to the individual kink frequency , @xmath22 , as a function of @xmath30 for @xmath41  20  km  s@xmath6 .",
    "the solid line corresponds to parallel low - frequency modes ( @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) while the dashed line corresponds to parallel high - frequency solutions ( @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) .",
    "dotted lines correspond to the doppler - shifted individual kink frequencies of the threads , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the small letters next to the solid line refer to particular situations studied in the text . adapted from @xcite.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]",
    "three interesting situations are worth to study and are denoted as @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 in figure  [ fig : phase ] .",
    "@xmath45 when @xmath46  km  s@xmath6 , which corresponds to a situation with counter - streaming flows , the solutions do not interact with each other and low - frequency ( high - frequency ) solutions are related to individual oscillations of the second ( first ) thread . for",
    "an external observer this situation would correspond to an individual thread oscillation .",
    "@xmath47 when @xmath48  km  s@xmath6 , both flow velocities and their directions are equal in both threads .",
    "in such a situation , there is a coupling between low- and high - frequency modes , and an avoided crossing of the solid and dashed lines is seen in figure  [ fig : phase ] and collective oscillations appear .",
    "@xmath49 when @xmath50  km  s@xmath6 .",
    "this case is just the opposite to @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , it corresponds again to an individual thread oscillation .",
    "considering now slow modes , the behavior of the @xmath20 and @xmath21 solutions can only be considered collective when the flow velocity is the same in both threads because , in such a case , both modes couple . when different flows are considered , the @xmath20 and @xmath21 slow modes behave like individual slow modes .",
    "the coupling between slow modes is very sensitive to the flow velocities , and the @xmath20 and @xmath21 solutions quickly decouple if @xmath28 and @xmath30 slightly differ .",
    "consider , now , a system of two nonidentical threads and focus first on kink modes . from above , we expect collective kink motions to occur when the doppler - shifted individual kink frequencies of both threads coincide .",
    "following @xcite , the relation between flow velocities @xmath28 and @xmath30 for which the coupling takes place is ,    @xmath51    where the @xmath37 sign is for parallel waves and the @xmath52 sign is for anti - parallel propagation .",
    "a similar analysis can be performed for slow modes to obtain , @xmath53 which points out that , in general , the coupling between slow modes occurs at different flow velocities than the coupling between kink modes .",
    "therefore , the simultaneous existence of collective slow and kink solutions in systems of non - identical threads is difficult .",
    "then , we could conclude that the relation between the individual alfvn ( sound ) speed of threads is determinant for the collective or individual behavior of kink ( slow ) modes . in the absence of flows and",
    "when the alfvn speeds of threads are similar , kink modes are of collective type . on the contrary ,",
    "when alfvn speeds differ each thread oscillates independently .",
    "the same happens for slow modes , but replacing the alfvn speeds by the sound speeds of threads .    in summary ,",
    "when flows are present in the equilibrium , collective motions can be found even in systems of non - identical threads by considering appropriate flow velocities .",
    "these velocities are within the observed values if threads with not too different temperatures and densities are assumed .",
    "however , since the flow velocities required for collective oscillations must take very particular values , such a special situation may rarely occur in real prominences .",
    "this conclusion has important repercussions for future prominence seismological applications , in the sense that if collective oscillations are observed in large areas of a prominence @xcite , threads in such regions should possess very similar temperatures , densities , and magnetic field strengths .",
    "this study has also confirmed that collective slow modes are efficiently damped by thermal mechanisms , with damping ratios similar to those reported in observations , @xmath27 , while collective fast waves are poorly damped .",
    "this is a key point since if the observed efficiently damped oscillations are transverse , this could suggest that other mechanisms could be at work ( see sects .",
    "@xmath54 and @xmath55 ) while if the observed oscillations correspond to slow modes , then , thermal mechanisms could account for the observed damping .",
    "therefore , it becomes crucial to be able to discriminate between the transversal or longitudinal character of the oscillations .",
    "however , we should also be aware that because of the inhomogeneous nature of filament threads coupling between modes could make a proper mode identification difficult .",
    "since the temperature of prominences is typically of the order of 10@xmath56 k , the prominence plasma is only partially ionized .",
    "the exact ionization degree of prominences is unknown and the reported ratio of electron density to neutral hydrogen density ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) covers about two orders of magnitude ( 0.1 - 10 ) .",
    "partial ionization brings the presence of neutrals and electrons in addition to ions , thus collisions between the different species are possible . because of the occurrence of collisions between electrons with neutral atoms and ions , and more importantly between ions and neutrals ,",
    "joule dissipation is enhanced , when compared to the fully ionized case .",
    "the main effects of partial ionization on the properties of mhd waves are manifested through a generalized ohm s law , which adds some extra terms in the resistive magnetic induction equation , in comparison to the fully ionized case .",
    "the induction equation can be cast as @xcite    @xmath57 \\times { \\mathit { \\bf b}}_0   \\right\\}\\nonumber \\\\   & & -   \\nabla \\times \\left [   \\eta_{\\rm h } \\left ( \\nabla \\times { \\mathit { \\bf b}}_1   \\right ) \\times { \\mathit { \\bf b}}_0 \\right ] , \\label{eq : induction}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with @xmath58 , and @xmath59 the perturbed magnetic field and velocity , respectively .",
    "quantities @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 in equation  ( [ eq : induction ] ) are the coefficients of ohmic , ambipolar , and hall s magnetic diffusion , and govern the collisions between the different plasma species .",
    "ohmic diffusion is mainly due to electron - ion collisions , ambipolar diffusion is mostly caused by ion - neutral collisions , and hall s effect is enhanced by ion - neutral collisions since they tend to decouple ions from the magnetic field while electrons remain able to drift with the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the ambipolar diffusivity can be expressed in terms of the cowling s coefficient , @xmath63 , as    @xmath64    the quantities @xmath60 and @xmath63 correspond to the magnetic diffusivities longitudinal and perpendicular to magnetic field lines , respectively . for a fully ionized plasma , @xmath65",
    ", there is no ambipolar diffusion , and magnetic diffusion is isotropic . due to the presence of neutrals , @xmath66 , meaning that perpendicular magnetic diffusion is much more efficient than longitudinal magnetic diffusion in a partially ionized plasma .",
    "it is important to note that @xmath67 even for a small relative density of neutrals .",
    "several studies have considered the damping of mhd waves in the solar atmosphere in partially ionized plasmas @xcite . in the context of solar prominences",
    "@xcite derived the full set of mhd equations for a partially ionized , one - fluid hydrogen plasma and applied them to the study of the time damping of linear , adiabatic fast and slow magneto - acoustic waves in an unbounded prominence medium .",
    "a partially ionized plasma can be represented as a single - fluid in the strong coupling approximation , which is valid when the ion density in the plasma is small and the collision time between neutrals and ions is short compared with other timescales in the problem . using this approximation",
    "we can describe the very low frequency and large - scale fluid - like behaviour of plasmas @xcite .",
    "the study by @xcite was later extended to the non - adiabatic case , including thermal conduction by neutrals and electrons and radiative losses @xcite .",
    "the most important results obtained by @xcite have been summarized recently by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite consider a uniform and unbounded prominence plasma and find that ion - neutral collisions are more important for fast waves , for which the ratio of the damping time to the period is in the range 1 to 10@xmath68 , than for slow waves , for which values in between 10@xmath56 and 10@xmath69 are obtained .",
    "fast waves are efficiently damped for moderate values of the ionization fraction , while in a nearly fully ionized plasma , the small amount of neutrals is insufficient to damp the perturbations .    in the above studies ,",
    "a hydrogen plasma has been considered , however , @xmath70 of the prominence chemical composition is hydrogen while the remaining @xmath71 is helium",
    ". therefore , it is of great interest to know the effect of the presence of helium on the behavior of magnetohydrodynamic waves in a partially ionized plasma with prominence physical properties .",
    "this study has been done by @xcite in a medium like that considered in @xcite , but composed of hydrogen and helium .",
    "the species present in the medium are electrons , protons , neutral hydrogen , neutral helium ( hei ) , and singly ionized helium ( heii ) , while the presence of he iii is negligible @xcite . under such conditions the basic mhd equations for a non - adiabatic , partially ionized",
    ", single - fluid plasma have been generalized .",
    "the hydrogen ionization degree is characterized by @xmath72 which varies between @xmath73 , for fully ionized hydrogen , and @xmath74 for fully neutral hydrogen .",
    "the helium ionization degree is characterized by @xmath75 , where @xmath76 and @xmath77 denote the relative densities of single ionized and neutral helium , respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig : mhdwaves ] displays @xmath24 as a function of @xmath78 for the alfvn , fast , and slow waves , and the results corresponding to several helium abundances are compared for hydrogen and helium ionization degrees of @xmath79 and @xmath80 , respectively .",
    "we can observe that the presence of helium has a minor effect on the results . in the case of alfvn and fast waves ( figs .  [",
    "fig : mhdwaves]a , b ) , a critical wavenumber , @xmath81 , at which the real part of the frequency becomes zero occurs .",
    "in a partially ionized plasma , this critical wavenumber , @xmath81 , is given by    @xmath82    where @xmath83 is the alfvn speed and @xmath84 the angle between the wavevector and the equilibrium magnetic field .",
    "the cowling s diffusivity , @xmath85 , depends on the fraction of neutrals and the collisional frequencies between electrons , ions and neutrals . when a fully ionized plasma is considered the numerical value of both diffusivities",
    "is the same and in a fully ionized ideal plasma this numerical value is taken equal to zero , therefore , the critical wavenumber goes to infinity .",
    "when partially ionized plasmas are considered , wavenumbers greater than the critical value only produce purely damped perturbations .",
    "since cowling s diffusivity is larger in the presence of helium because of additional collisions of neutral and singly ionized helium species , @xmath81 is shifted toward slightly lower values than when only hydrogen is considered , so the larger @xmath77 , the smaller @xmath81 . in the case of the slow wave ( fig .  [ fig : mhdwaves]c ) ,",
    "the maximum and the right hand side minimum of @xmath24 are also slightly shifted toward lower values of @xmath78 .",
    "previous results from @xcite and @xcite suggest that thermal conduction is responsible for these maxima and minima of @xmath24 .",
    "the additional contribution of neutral helium atoms to thermal conduction produces this displacement of the curve of @xmath24 . in the case of alfvn and fast waves ,",
    "this effect is not very important .",
    "although @xcite suggest that for central prominence temperature a realistic ratio between the number densities of @xmath76 to @xmath77 is @xmath71 , in figure  [ fig : mhdwaves ] , and for sake of comparison , the results for @xmath86 and @xmath87 have been also plotted .",
    "+        finally , the thermal mode has been considered .",
    "since it is a purely damped , non - propagating disturbance ( @xmath88 ) , we only plot the damping time , @xmath89 , as a function of @xmath78 for @xmath79 and @xmath80 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mhdwaves]d ) .",
    "we observe that the effect of helium is different in two ranges of @xmath78 .",
    "for @xmath90  m@xmath6 , thermal conduction is the dominant damping mechanism , so the larger the amount of helium , the smaller @xmath89 because of the enhanced thermal conduction by neutral helium atoms . on the other hand ,",
    "radiative losses are more relevant for @xmath91  m@xmath6 . in this region ,",
    "the thermal mode damping time grows as the helium abundance increases .",
    "since these variations in the damping time are very small , we again conclude that the damping time obtained in the absence of helium does not significantly change when helium is taken into account .    in summary ,",
    "the study by @xcite points out that the consideration of neutral or single ionized helium in partially ionized prominence plasmas does not modify the behavior of linear , adiabatic or non - adiabatic mhd waves already found by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite analyzed small amplitude oscillations in a polar crown prominence and reported the presence of a plane propagating wave as well as a standing wave . in the case of the propagating wave , which was interpreted as a slow mhd wave , the amplitude of the oscillations spatially decreased in a substantial way after a distance of @xmath92 km from the location where wave motion was being generated .",
    "this distance can be considered as a typical spatial damping length , @xmath93 , of the oscillations . on the other hand ,",
    "a typical feature in prominence oscillations is the presence of flows which are observed in @xmath94 , uv and euv lines @xcite . in @xmath94",

    "recently , observations made with hinode / sot by @xcite reported the presence of synchronous vertical oscillatory motions in the threads of an active region prominence , together with the presence of flows along the same threads .",
    "however , in limb prominences different kinds of flows are observed and , for instance , observations made by @xcite with hinode / sot have revealed a complex dynamics with vertical downflows and upflows .",
    "the spatial damping of magnetohydrodynamic waves in a homogeneous and unbounded fully ionized plasma was studied by @xcite .",
    "recently , the spatial damping of linear non - adiabatic magnetohydrodynamic waves in a homogenous , unbounded , magnetized and flowing partially ionized plasma has been studied by @xcite .",
    "since we consider a medium with physical properties akin to those of a solar prominence , the density is @xmath95 kg m@xmath96 , the temperature @xmath97  k , the magnetic field @xmath98= 10  g , and , in general , a field - aligned flow with @xmath99 km s@xmath6 has been considered .",

    "when the ionization decreases , the damping length of these waves also decreases and the efficiency of their spatial damping in the range of periods of interest is improved , although the most efficient damping is attained for periods below @xmath74 s. a new feature is that when a flow is present a new third alfvn wave , strongly attenuated , appears .",
    "the presence of this wave depends on the joint action of flow and resistivities , and it could only be detected by an external observer to the flow .    in the case of non - adiabatic magnetoacoustic waves ,",
    "when partial ionization is present the behavior of fast , slow and thermal waves is strongly modified .",
    "in particular , the damping length of a fast wave in a partially ionized plasma is strongly diminished by neutrals thermal conduction for periods between @xmath108 and @xmath109 s , and , at the same time , the radiative plateau present in fully ionized ideal plasmas almost disappears .",
    "the behavior of slow waves is not so strongly modified as for fast waves , although thermal conduction by neutrals also diminishes the damping length for periods below @xmath101 s , and a short radiative plateau still remains for periods between @xmath101 and @xmath110 s. thermal waves are only slightly modified although the effect of partial ionization is to increase the damping length of these waves , just the opposite to what happens with the other waves .",

    "the effects of partial ionization could also be relevant , at least for short wavelengths .",
    "the question arises on whether partial ionization affects the mechanism of resonant absorption . @xcite",
    "have integrated both mechanisms in a non - uniform cylindrical filament thread model in order to assess both analytically and numerically the combined effects of partial ionization and alfvnic resonant absorption on the kink mode damping .",
    "apart from the inherent relevance of this work in connection to the damping of prominence oscillations , this study constitutes the first of the kind that considers the resonant absorption phenomenon in a partially ionized plasma .",
    "the filament thread model used by @xcite is an infinite straight cylinder with prominence - like conditions embedded in an unbounded coronal medium .",
    "resonant damping is included in the model by connecting the prominence and coronal densities by means of a transitional layer , with a characteristic inhomogeneity length - scale @xmath156 ( see expressions [ [ rhor ] ] and [ [ rhotrans ] ] ) .",
    "the plasma properties are now also characterized by the ionization fraction , @xmath228 .",
    "the coronal plasma is assumed to be fully ionized , but the prominence material is only partially ionized . as with the transverse density variation ,",
    "the radial behavior of the ionization fraction in filament threads is unknown , but a one - dimensional transverse profile , similar to the one used to model the equilibrium density , can be assumed .",
    "the following profile for the ionization fraction , @xmath229 , is adopted    @xmath230    with @xmath231\\right\\},\\ ] ] where the filament ionization fraction , @xmath232 , is considered a free parameter and the corona is assumed to be fully ionized , so @xmath233 .",
    "the non - uniform transitional layer of length @xmath156 therefore connects plasma with densities in the range @xmath154 and @xmath155 and ionization degrees in the range @xmath234 and @xmath235 . as before , the one - fluid approximation is used and for simplicity the @xmath236 limit , which excludes slow waves , is considered .",
    "the quantities @xmath60 , @xmath63 , and @xmath62 are now functions of the radial direction .      in order to obtain some analytical approximations , first , only cowling s diffusion is considered .",
    "this basically introduces perpendicular magnetic diffusion and allows to derive an analytical dispersion relation for transverse oscillations , since the induction equation can be written in a compact form as follows    @xmath237    where @xmath238 is the modified alfvn speed squared @xcite . the dispersion relation for trapped waves",
    "is obtained by imposing that the solutions are regular at @xmath239 , the continuity of the radial displacement , @xmath169 , and the total pressure perturbation , @xmath240 , at the tube boundary , and that perturbations must vanish at infinity ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the dispersion relation reads @xmath241 , with    @xmath242    where @xmath243 and @xmath244 are the bessel function and the modified bessel function of the first kind , respectively , and the quantities @xmath245 and @xmath246 are given by    @xmath247    as shown in section  [ resonantdamping ] , an analytical dispersion relation in the case @xmath248 can be obtained in the thin boundary approximation , by making use of the jump conditions for the radial displacement and the total pressure perturbation at the alfvn resonance ( expressions [ [ jumpalfven ] ] ) .",
    "this dispersion relation is @xmath249    note that equation  ( [ eq : dispercapa ] ) is formally identical to equation  ( [ disperalfven ] ) , but now @xmath250 is defined in equation  ( [ eq : dispernocapa ] ) . by combining the thin tube and thin boundary approximations , and neglecting terms proportional to @xmath251 , @xcite",
    "arrive at the following short - hand expression for the damping time over the period    @xmath252^{-1 } , \\label{eq : tdp}\\ ] ]    with @xmath253 the filament and coronal cowling s diffusivities in dimensionless form .",
    "we see that the term related to the resonant damping is independent of the value of cowling s diffusivity and , therefore , of the ionization degree , and takes the same form as in a fully ionized plasma , see e.g. equation  ( 77 ) in @xcite and equation  ( 56 ) in @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the second term related to the damping by cowling s diffusion is proportional to @xmath130 , so its influence in the long - wavelength limit is expected to be small . to perform a simple calculation ,",
    "consider the case @xmath147 , @xmath254 , and @xmath255 .",
    "this results in @xmath256 for a fully ionized thread ( @xmath257 ) , and @xmath258 for an almost neutral thread ( @xmath259 ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath260 depends very slightly on the ionization degree , suggesting that resonant absorption dominates over cowling s diffusion .",
    "the relative importance of the two mechanisms can be estimated by taking the ratio of the two terms on the right - hand side of equation  ( [ eq : tdp ] )    @xmath261    with @xmath262 and @xmath263 the damping times due to resonant absorption and cowling s diffusion , respectively .",
    "this last expression can be further simplified by considering that in filament threads @xmath264 and @xmath265 , so that @xmath266 the efficiency of cowling s diffusion with respect to that of resonant absorption increases with @xmath267 and @xmath232 ( through @xmath268 ) .",
    "considering the same parameters as before , one obtains @xmath269 for @xmath257 , and @xmath270 for @xmath259 , meaning that resonant absorption is much more efficient than cowling s diffusion . from equation  ( [ eq : ratiotaus ] )",
    "it is also possible to estimate the wavenumber for which cowling s diffusion becomes more important than resonant absorption , by setting @xmath271 , as @xmath272 considering again the same parameters , equation  ( [ eq : kzcra ] ) gives @xmath273 for @xmath257 , and @xmath274 for @xmath259 .",
    "note however that equation  ( [ eq : ratiotaus ] ) is only valid for @xmath275 , so resonant absorption is expected to be the dominant damping mechanism in the long - wavelength regime , even for an almost neutral filament plasma .",
    "the analytical estimates described above are verified and extended by @xcite by numerically solving the full eigenvalue problem .",
    "computations include now hall s diffusion in addition to ohmic and cowling s dissipation .",
    "first , a homogeneous filament thread without transitional layer ( @xmath276 ) is considered .",
    "this is the same case presented in section  [ robertopicyl ] with the addition of hall s term in the induction equation .",
    "figure  [ fig : nocapa]a displays the obtained damping rate for different ionization degrees . in agreement with the results displayed for the kink mode in figure  [ figpicyl1 ]",
    ", @xmath260 has a maximum which corresponds to the transition between the ohmic - dominated regime , which is almost independent of the ionization degree , to the region where cowling s diffusion is more relevant and the ionization degree has a significant influence .",
    "the approximate solution obtained by solving equation  ( [ eq : dispernocapa ] ) for a given value of @xmath122 agrees very well with the numerical solution in the region where cowling s diffusion dominates , while it significantly diverges from the numerical solution in the region where ohmic diffusion is relevant . within the range of typically reported wavelengths",
    ", @xmath260 is between 1 and 2 orders of magnitude larger than the measured values , so neither ohmic nor cowling s diffusion can account for the observed damping time .",
    "figure  [ fig : nocapa]b shows that the smaller the thread radius , the more rapidly the kink wave is attenuated . in addition , the critical wavenumbers are shifted when varying the thickness of the threads and the wavenumber range for which the kink wave propagates is wider for thick threads than for thin threads .",
    "the critical wavenumbers are far from the relevant values of @xmath267 for the observed thread widths , and so they should not affect the kink wave propagation in realistic filament threads .",
    "next , the inhomogeneous case ( @xmath248 ) is analyzed , with the inclusion of resonant wave coupling in the alfvn continuum . figure  [ fig : capa]a displays some relevant differences with respect to the homogeneous case ( @xmath276 ) .",
    "first , the damping time is dramatically reduced for intermediate values of @xmath267 including the region of typically observed wavelengths . in this region , the ratio @xmath260 becomes smaller as @xmath157 is increased , a behavior consistent with damping by resonant absorption .",
    "the ratio @xmath260 is independent of the thickness of the layer , and for large @xmath267 coincides with the solution in the homogeneous case .",
    "the cause of this behavior is that perturbations are essentially confined within the homogeneous part of the thread for large @xmath267 , and therefore the kink mode is mainly governed by the internal plasma conditions . on the other hand ,",
    "the solution for small @xmath267 is completely different when @xmath277 .",
    "the inclusion of the inhomogeneous transitional layer removes the smaller critical wavenumber and consequently the kink mode exists for very small values of @xmath267 .",
    "figure  [ fig : capa]a also shows a very good agreement between the numerical and the analytical solutions ( obtained by solving the dispersion relation  [ [ eq : dispercapa ] ] ) , for wavenumbers above @xmath278 , and a poor agreement in the range for which ohmic diffusion dominates , below @xmath278 . to understand this one has to bear in mind that dispersion relation  ( [ eq : dispercapa ] ) takes into account the effects of resonant absorption and cowling s diffusion , but not the influence of ohmic diffusion . as figure",
    "[ fig : capa]b shows , the ionization degree is only relevant for large wavenumbers , where the damping rate significantly depends on the ionization fraction .     corresponding to a thread with @xmath279  km and @xmath255 .",
    "the different linestyles represent the results for : partially ionized thread with @xmath280 considering all the terms in the induction equation ( solid line ) , partially ionized thread with @xmath280 neglecting hall s term ( symbols ) , and fully ionized thread ( dotted line ) . adapted from @xcite .",
    "[ fig6soler ] , scaledwidth=100.0% ]    finally , figure  [ fig6soler ] displays the ranges of @xmath267 where cowling s and hall s diffusion dominate . as expected , hall s diffusion is irrelevant in the whole studied range of @xmath267 , while cowling s diffusion dominates the damping for large @xmath267 . in the whole range of relevant wavelengths ,",
    "resonant absorption is the most efficient damping mechanism , and the damping time is independent of the ionization degree as predicted by the analytical result ( eq .  [ [ eq : tdp ] ] ) . on the contrary ,",
    "ohmic diffusion dominates for very small @xmath267 . in that region , the damping time related to ohm s dissipation becomes even smaller than that due to resonant absorption , meaning that the kink wave is mainly damped by ohmic diffusion .",
    "solar atmospheric seismology aims to determine physical parameters in magnetic and plasma structures that are difficult to measure by direct means .",
    "it is a remote diagnostics method that combines observations of oscillations and waves in magnetic structures , together with theoretical results from the analysis of oscillatory properties of models of those structures .",
    "the philosophy behind this discipline is akin to that of earth seismology , the sounding of the earth interior using seismic waves , and helio - seismology , the acoustic diagnostic of the solar interior .",
    "it was first suggested by @xcite and @xcite , in the coronal context , and by @xcite in a prominence context .",
    "the last years increase in the number and quality of high resolution observations has lead to its rapid development . in the context of coronal loop oscillations , recent applications of this technique",
    "have allowed the estimation and/or restriction of parameters such as the magnetic field strength @xcite , the alfvn speed in coronal loops @xcite , the transversal density structuring @xcite , or the coronal density scale height @xcite .",
    "its application to prominences is less developed .",
    "some recent results of the mhd prominence seismology technique are shown .      the first prominence seismology application using hinode observations of flowing and transversely oscillating threads was presented by @xcite , using observations obtained in an active region filament by @xcite .",
    "the observations show a number of threads that flow following a path parallel to the photosphere while they are oscillating in the vertical direction .",
    "@xcite interpret these oscillations in terms of the kink mode of a magnetic flux tube . by using previous theoretical results from a normal mode analysis in a two - dimensional piecewise filament thread model by @xcite and @xcite",
    ", these authors find that , although it is not possible to univocally determine the physical parameters of interest , a one - to - one relation between the thread alfvn speed and the coronal alfvn speed can be established .",
    "this relation comes in the form of a number of curves relating the two alfvn speeds for different values of the length of the magnetic flux tube and the density contrast between the filament and coronal plasma .",
    "the obtained curves have an asymptotic behavior for large values of the density contrast , typical of filament to coronal plasmas , and hence a lower limit for the thread alfvn speed can be obtained .",
    "further details on this study can be found in @xcite and @xcite .    a recent application of the prominence seismology technique , using the period of observed filament thread transverse oscillations can be found in @xcite .",
    "these authors find observational evidence about swaying motions of individual filament threads from high resolution observations obtained with the swedish 1-m solar telescope in la palma .",
    "the presence of waves propagating along individual threads was already evident in , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "however , the fact that line - of - sight oscillations are observed in prominences beyond the limb , as well as in filaments against the disk , suggests that the planes of the oscillation may acquire various orientations relative to the local solar reference system .",
    "for this reason , @xcite combine simultaneous recordings of motions in the line - of - sight and in the plane of the sky , which leads to information about the orientation of the oscillatory plane in each case .",
    "periodic oscillatory signals are obtained in a number of threads , that are next fitted to sine curves , from which the period and the amplitude of the waves are derived .",
    "the presence of different cuts along the structures allow @xcite to obtain the phase difference between the fitted curves , which can be used to measure the phase velocities of the waves .",
    "the overall periods and mean velocity amplitudes that are obtained correspond to short period , @xmath281 3.6 s , and small amplitude @xmath282 km s@xmath6 oscillations .",
    "the information obtained from these h@xmath0 filtergrams in the plane of the sky is combined with h@xmath0 dopplergrams , which allow to detect oscillations in the line - of - sight direction . by combining the observed oscillations in the two orthogonal directions",
    "the full vectors are derived , which show that the oscillatory planes are close to the vertical .",
    "@xcite interpret the observed swaying thread oscillations as kink mhd waves supported by the thread body . by assuming the classic one - dimensional , straight , flux tube model a comparison between the observed wave properties and the theoretical prediction is performed on order to obtain the physical parameters of interest , namely the alfvn speed and the magnetic field strength in the studied threads . to this end @xmath143 with @xmath168 defined by equation  ( [ kinkfrequency ] )",
    "is used as an approximation to the kink speed , which can directly be associated to the measured phase velocity of the observed disturbances .",
    "figure  [ seismologylin09]a shows that , for the large density contrasts expected for filament threads , the curve that relates the kink speed to the alfvn speed becomes flat , and so the ratio is almost independent of the density contrast .",
    "this allows to simplify the kink speed to @xmath283 and therefore obtain the thread alfvn speed through @xmath284 .",
    "the obtained values for a set of 10 threads can be found in table 2 in @xcite .",
    "once the alfvn speed in each thread is determined , the magnetic field strength can be computed , if a given internal density is assumed . for a typical value of @xmath198 kg m@xmath96 magnetic field strengths in between 0.9 -3.5 g",
    "are obtained , for the analyzed events .",
    "if the unknown density is allowed to vary in a range of plausible values , the derived magnetic field strength also changes accordingly , as can be seen in figure  [ seismologylin09]b .",
    "the important conclusion that we extract from the analysis by @xcite is that prominence seismology is possible and works well , provided high resolution observations are available .",
    "the derived plasma parameters show rather different values for different threads , which indicates that the plasma parameters may be varying along individual threads belonging to the same filament .",
    "this however does not come as a surprise in view of the highly inhomogeneous nature of these objects .",
    "a feature clearly observed by @xcite is that the amplitudes of the waves passing through two different cuts along a thread are notably different .",
    "apparent changes can be due to damping of the waves in addition to the noise in the data . among the different damping mechanisms that are described in this paper , resonant absorption in",
    "the alfvn continuum seems a very plausible mechanism and is open to direct application for filament thread seismology , using the damping as an additional source of information .",
    "this additional information has been used by @xcite in the context of transversely oscillating coronal loops and its application to filament threads is straightforward .",
    "the analytical and numerical inversion schemes by @xcite and @xcite make use of the simple idea that it is the same magnetic structure , whose equilibrium conditions we are interested to assess , that is oscillating with a given period and undergoing a given damping rate . by computing the kink normal mode frequency and damping time as a function of the relevant equilibrium parameters for a one - dimensional model , the period and damping rate have the following dependencies    @xmath285    where @xmath286 the internal alfvn travel time . in the case of coronal loop oscillations ,",
    "an estimate for @xmath130 can be obtained directly from the length of the loop and the fact that the fundamental kink mode wavelength is twice this quantity . for filament threads ,",
    "the wavelength of oscillations needs to be measured .",
    "relations  ( [ relations ] ) indicate that , if no assumption is made in any of the physical parameters of interest , we have two observed quantities , period and damping time , and three unknowns , density contrast , transverse inhomogeneity length - scale , and alfvn travel time ( or conversely alfvn speed through the relation @xmath287 ) .",
    "there are therefore infinite different equilibrium models that can equally well explain the observations .",
    "these valid equilibrium models are displayed in figure  [ seismologyarregui]a , where the analytical algebraic expressions in the thin tube and thin boundary approximations by @xcite have been used to invert the problem .",
    "it can be appreciated that , even if an infinite number of solutions is obtained , they define a rather constrained range of values for the thread alfvn speed .",
    "also , and because of the insensitiveness of the damping rate with density contrast , for the typically large values of this parameter in prominence plasmas , the obtained solution curve displays an asymptotic behavior for large values of @xmath44 .",
    "this allows us to obtain precise estimates for the filament thread alfvn speed , @xmath288",
    "km s@xmath6 , and the transverse inhomogeneity length scale , @xmath289 . note that these asymptotic values can directly be obtained by inverting equations  ( [ period ] ) and ( [ dampingrate ] ) for the period and the damping rate in the limit @xmath179 .",
    "the computation of the magnetic field strength from the obtained seismological curve requires the assumption of a particular value for either the filament or the coronal density .",
    "the resulting curve for a typical coronal density is shown in figure  [ seismologyarregui]b . as can be seen ,",
    "precise values of the magnetic field strength can not be obtained , unless the density contrast is accurately known .",
    "solar prominences are , probably , the most complex structures in the solar corona . a full understanding of their formation , magnetic structure and disappearance has not been reached yet , and a lot of physical effects remain to be included in prominence models . for this reason , theoretical models set up to interpret small - amplitude oscillations and",
    "their damping are still poor .",
    "high - resolution observations of filaments suggest that they are made of threads whose thickness is at the limit of the available spatial resolution .",
    "then , one may wonder whether future improvements of the spatial resolution will provide with thinner and thinner threads or , on the contrary , there is a lower limit for thickness and we will able to determine it in the near future .",
    "the presence of these long and thin threads together with the place where they are anchored and the presence of flows along them suggest that they are thin flux tubes filled with continuous or discontinuous cool material .",
    "this cool material is probably subject to cooling , heating , ionization , recombination , motions , etc . which , altogether , makes a theoretical treatment very difficult .",
    "for instance , in the case of the considered thermal mechanisms , up to now only optically thin radiation has been considered while , probably , the consideration of optically thick effects would be more realistic ; the prominence heating mechanisms usually taken into account are tentative and `` ad hoc '' while true prominence heating processes are still deeply unknown",
    ". an important step ahead would be to couple radiative transfer with magnetohydrodynamic waves as a means to establish a relationship between velocity , density , magnetic field and temperature perturbations , and the observed signatures of oscillations like spectral line shift , width and intensity .",
    "partial ionization is another topic of interest for prominence oscillations since , apart from influencing the behavior of magnetohydrodynamic waves , it poses an important problem for prominence equilibrium models when gravity is taken into account and which is : how non - ionized prominence material is kept in the magnetic field ? .",
    "another issue which still remains a mystery is the triggering mechanism of small - amplitude oscillations . in the case of large - amplitude oscillations ,",
    "observations provide with information about the exciting mechanism , however , the available observations of small - amplitude oscillations do not show any signature of the exciting mechanism . are these oscillations of chromospheric or photospheric origin",
    "? are they generated inside prominence magnetic structure by small reconnection events ?",
    "are they produced by weak external disturbances coming from far away in the solar atmosphere ?",
    "the changing physical conditions of prominence plasmas suggest that for an in - depth theoretical study of prominence oscillations more complex models together with numerical simulations are needed . therefore , and",
    "as a step ahead , in the next future numerical studies of the time evolution of magnetohydrodynamic waves in partially ionized flowing inhomogeneous prominence plasmas , subject to different physical processes such as ionization , recombination , etc .",
    ", should be undertaken .",
    "however , a full three - dimensional dynamical prominence model involving magnetic equilibrium , radiative transfer , etc . whose oscillatory behavior could be studied seems to be still far away in the future .",
