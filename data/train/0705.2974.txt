    "the study of the phase diagram of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) has attracted a lot of interest in the last years . in particular ,",
    "the major theoretical improvement of the knowledge of the high density and low temperature regime of qcd has been achieved by phenomenological studies based both on nambu - jona lasinio ( njl ) models  @xcite and abstract formulations relying on ginzburg - landau expansions of the free energy  @xcite . in these extreme conditions",
    "the qcd ground state is likely to be a color superconductor ( for reviews see  @xcite ) .    at asymptotic densities ( or equivalently , at asymptotic baryon chemical potential @xmath1 ) and low temperatures the ground state of three flavor quark matter is the color - flavor - locked state ( cfl )  @xcite , where the color and flavor symmetries of qcd are broken spontaneously by a di - quark vacuum expectation value proportional to the gap parameter @xmath2 , but a residual group linking color and vector flavor symmetries is left . in the cfl phase",
    "all the quarks pair among themselves and get an effective mass @xmath2 .",
    "when the density is decreased , finite quark masses effects and electrical and color neutrality conditions break the symmetric cfl state into a less symmetric state .",
    "examples include the gapless cfl state  @xcite , kaon condensed states  @xcite , inhomogeneous three flavor color superconductors  @xcite , gapless two flavor color superconductors , both in the homogeneous  @xcite and inhomogeneous realizations  @xcite , and spin one pairing  @xcite .",
    "in particular , denoting by @xmath3 the in - medium strange quark mass , we remind that the parameter useful to describe the cfl@xmath4gcfl transition is @xmath5 : if it is smaller than 1 then the ground state is the cfl phase ; on the other hand , if @xmath6 then the ground state is the gapless gcfl phase , characterized by gapless quark excitations in the spectrum .",
    "unfortunately gapless homogeneous phases suffer the problem of meissner anti - screening : the squared meissner masses of some of the gluons , when evaluated in the one loop approximation , turn out to be negative , both in the two flavor  @xcite and in the three flavor  @xcite case .",
    "this fact is interpreted as an instability toward a gluon condensed state  @xcite and/or an inhomogeneous ground states , with meson currents spontaneously generated  @xcite and non isotropic pairing  @xcite among quarks .    in the cfl state",
    "the chiral symmetry is broken , and an octet of pseudoscalar meson fields appear in the spectrum as required by the goldstone theorem . beside them",
    "two flavor singlet fields arise because of the breaking of the baryon @xmath7 and of the axial @xmath8 which is restored at high densities .",
    "the fact that all the quarks are gapped implies the existence of two characteristic energy scales in the cfl phase : the gap parameter @xmath2 , that roughly speaking measures the mass of the fermion excitations , and the high baryon chemical potential @xmath9 . since the gap is much smaller than the chemical potential ( and thus of the fermi momenta of the quarks ) the quark dynamics is dominated by the fermion modes living in a thin shell around the fermi surface : one can therefore write a renormalized effective fermion action ( in the sense of wilson ) , in terms of the soft modes that live near the fermi surface  @xcite . moreover , since the fermion excitations are gapped , for energies much smaller than the gap one can describe the low energy physics of the cfl phase by means of the light flavor excitations  @xcite .    it was noticed  @xcite that a finite strange quark mass can modify the cfl ground state before the transition to gcfl occurs : as a matter of fact , in the limit of isospin symmetry @xmath10 ( capital letters denote in - medium quark masses ) , the excitations with kaon quantum numbers feel an effective chemical potential that can become larger than the kaon mass if the strange quark mass is large enough .",
    "if this is the case then it is possible to lower the free energy of the system by forming a kaon bose - einstein condensate .",
    "astrophysical implications of the presence of a kaon condensed phase in the core of a compact star have been widely studied  @xcite .",
    "it becomes clear then that the knowledge of the effective masses of the kaon modes in the cfl phase is important for the determination of the true ground state of three flavor qcd .",
    "the important project of writing an effective lagrangian for the flavor excitations , and thus of their effective masses , in the cfl phase of qcd is a classical topic widely covered  @xcite ; it has been considered more recently in  @xcite , where the effects of electrical and color neutrality and of the finite quark masses have been introduced .",
    "however , we have noticed that up to now there exists no clear derivation of the effective masses of the kaons in the cfl phase , and in particular of their effective chemical potentials , based on a purely microscopic model of quarks interacting with the flavor excitations .",
    "we wish to cover this important topic here .",
    "the main scope of our work is to show how the effective chemical potentials felt by the kaon fields , responsible of the kaon condensation phenomenon and deduced on the basis of symmetries in  @xcite , arise as loop effects once the octet of the @xmath11 flavor excitations is introduced as an external field  @xcite .",
    "recently the same procedure has been applied in ref .",
    "@xcite to the goldstone modes of the inhomogeneous three flavor superconductive state .    from the very beginning we work in an electrically and color neutral state .",
    "this is the case because any homogeneous ground states in qcd has to be color neutral  @xcite .",
    "moreover , one can show , by using a low energy effective lagrangian of the cfl phase  @xcite that color neutrality implies the decoupling , from the low energy spectrum , of the colored degrees of freedom , leaving a lagrangian written in terms of the only color singlet axial flavor excitations ( we neglect the flavor singlets corresponding to @xmath12 and @xmath8 ) .",
    "this turns to be equivalent to impose color neutrality in the microscopic model  @xcite : as a consequence , in order to reproduce properly such a low energy effective lagrangian by a microscopic theory of interacting quarks , the starting point must be a color neutral state .",
    "we perform the calculation of the effective meson chemical potentials both analytically , by an expansion in powers of @xmath13 , and numerically .",
    "the method presented here is applicable to the gapless cfl phase as well .",
    "the analytical calculation shows an interesting aspect : if one does not forces color neutrality , and leaves the color chemical potentials arbitrary , then one notices that the effective mass of the kaons does not recover the value obtained by the effective theory . only if the color chemical potentials are chosen in order to fulfill the neutrality condition , that is only if one considers a neutral state , then the two results match .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : quarks ] we describe the quark content of the model . in section  [ sec : r ] we introduce the @xmath11 flavor excitations as external fields via the eguchi recipe  @xcite , defining their coupling to the quarks and their one loop effective lagrangian by integrating over the quarks in the functional integral .",
    "section  [ sec : analyt ] is the main body of the paper : we compute both analytically and numerically the effective chemical potentials felt by the flavored meson fields , once the chemical potentials of the quarks are chosen in order to fulfill the neutrality conditions ( since we work in the limit @xmath14 only the kaons are massive , while all of the other meson modes are massless  @xcite ) .",
    "finally , we draw our conclusions , indicating some consequences of our results and possible improvements of the work .",
    "in this paper we deal with three flavor quark matter , whose interaction is modeled by a local nambu - jona lasinio ( njl ) lagrangian  @xcite ( for reviews see  @xcite ) .",
    "the main limitation of njl models is the lack of gluons ; nevertheless , as it is consistent with the global symmetries of qcd , it is believed to be able to capture the essential physics of the problem .    at finite chemical potential and in presence of color condensation",
    "the quark lagrangian is given by @xmath15 in the above equation @xmath16 is the quark chemical potential matrix , with color and flavor indices .",
    "it depends on @xmath1 ( the average quark chemical potential ) , @xmath17 ( the electron chemical potential ) , and @xmath18 ( color chemical potentials ) @xcite . for color and electric neutrality to be implemented it",
    "is sufficient to consider only these chemical potentials , related as they are to the charge matrix and the diagonal color operators @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( in general one should introduce a color chemical potential for each @xmath21 color charge ; however , as shown in  @xcite , for the condensate with the color - flavor structure considered in this paper it is enough to consider only @xmath22 and @xmath23 , since the charges related to the other color generators automatically vanish ) . therefore the matrix @xmath16 is written as follows @xmath24 with @xmath25 ( @xmath26 flavor indices ; @xmath27 colour indices ) .",
    "the term @xmath28 is responsible for color condensation , and is given in the mean field approximation by @xmath29 eq .",
    "describes the fact that in the ground state one has a non - vanishing expectation value of the di - quark field operator @xmath30 in this work we are interested to the cfl phase  @xcite : in this case @xmath31 , independent of the space coordinates @xmath32 .",
    "finally , @xmath33 in eq .",
    "denote the in - medium quark mass of the flavor @xmath34 .",
    "here we treat the quark masses at the leading order in @xmath35 : at this order the effect of the finite mass is a shift of the quark chemical potentials @xmath36 by the amount @xmath37 .",
    "this is a widely used approximation , which captures the main role of the finite quark masses , namely the reduction of their fermi spheres ( in addition to that , the approximation allows for easier calculations ) .    in this paper",
    "we adopt the high density effective description of qcd  @xcite : this approximation amounts to consider only the quarks with momenta close to the fermi surface ; this approximation is justified since in the weak coupling regime , to which we are interested here , the quarks living inside the fermi sphere are pauli blocked and are not relevant for the dynamics ; moreover , the negative energy fields give rise to operators that are formally suppressed by inverse powers of @xmath1 and therefore give a negligible contribution to the quark propagator .    the high density effective lagrangian of the quarks in the cfl phase of qcd has been discussed many times in the literature ( see for example  @xcite ) , therefore here we simply quote the result in the momentum space , namely @xmath38 here @xmath39 is a color - flavor index ; the rotation to the new basis is performed by means of the matrices @xmath40 defined in  @xcite .",
    "the kinetic terms are defined as @xmath41  , @xmath42 .",
    "the quark momenta are measured as @xmath43 , @xmath44 , with @xmath45 a unit vector denoting the fermi velocity of the quarks and @xmath1 is a reference large momentum , usually equal to the baryon chemical potential .",
    "the chemical potential of the quark with index @xmath46 is written as @xmath47 and @xmath48 . the entry @xmath49 contains also the effective mass @xmath37 of the flavor @xmath34 .",
    "the gap matrix is given by @xmath50 $ ] .",
    "finally , we have introduced the nambu - gorkov doublet for the left - handed fields , @xmath51    the calculations presented in the section  [ sec : analyt ] are devoted to the evaluation of the masses of the excitations related to the breaking of the @xmath11 symmetry . in that context",
    "one needs to add mass corrections to the high density effective theory ( hdet ) .",
    "one way to do that consistently in a njl model is to introduce an anti - gap term to the above lagrangian : it has been treated many times in the literature , and its role in the calculation of pseudo - nambu - goldstone modes in njl studies of high density qcd has been emphasized .",
    "in particular we need the lagrangian which describes antiquark  antiquark pairing , introduced in the hdet formalims in  @xcite . on the other hand , starting from the qcd quark - gluon vertex it is possible to get effective four fermion interactions by integrating out the electric gluons , see for example the clear discussion in  @xcite .",
    "the introduction of such vertices is essential in qcd since it has been shown that the anti - gap lagrangian gives rise to gauge dependent values of the shift in the vacuum energy generated by the finite values of the quark masses  @xcite ; also , when one considers quark - antiquark pairing , the shift of the vacuum energy sum up to zero and one is left with the quark - quark contribution only , see eq .",
    "( 39 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite . in any case ( njl or qcd )",
    "the contribution of this kind of corrections to the squared meson masses is highly suppressed since it contains light quark mass insertions . as a consequence",
    "one can obtain them in the microscopic calculation by putting @xmath52 in the quark propagators , and the well known results hold  @xcite .",
    "we close this section by defining the left handed quark propagator in momentum space , @xmath53 the analogous green function of the right handed quarks is obtained trivially from the previous one . from now on we consider the limit @xmath14 . thus the electrical and color neutrality conditions are fulfilled by  @xcite @xmath54 after these assumptions are made we write explicitly the chemical potentials entering into the quark lagrangian   in the case of the neutral cfl phase : @xmath47 with  @xcite @xmath55 @xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath58 from the above equations we notice that the chemical potentials of the quarks with @xmath59 is the same : thus it results more convenient , in the hdet momenta decomposition , to choose @xmath60 as the large reference momentum .",
    "in this section we derive the coupling of the quarks to the goldstones . following ref .",
    "@xcite the @xmath11 excitations are introduced in the model by rotating the cfl quark condensate .",
    "this rotation can be achieved on the left handed fields by means of the axial flavor transformations defined by  @xcite @xmath61 where @xmath62 , @xmath63 are the gell - mann matrices , normalized as @xmath64  , and @xmath65 is the decay constant . for the right",
    "fields the transformation is analogous .    in order to properly describe the @xmath11 goldstone excitations we promote the quark mass matrix @xmath66 to a spurion field that has definite transformations under chiral transformations , that is @xmath67 an analogous transformation is introduced for the charge matrix : @xmath68 . in this way the effective quark mass term for the left handed fields , namely @xmath69 , and the charge chemical potential term @xmath70 are invariant under the chiral transformations ( the same is true for the right handed fields ) , and thus under the quark rotation defined by eq .  .",
    "the lagrangian is thus given by @xmath71 where @xmath72~.\\ ] ] after the rotation is done , one sets the chemical potentials and the quark masses to their values in the neutral cfl phase . from the above equation it is clear that the @xmath11 flavor excitations are introduced only as a rotation of the quark condensate , and disappear from the spectrum if at this stage one sets @xmath73 .",

    "we present analytical results that can easily obtained by expanding the quark propagator in powers of @xmath13 .",

    "we have repeated the above calculation setting @xmath23 to an arbitrary value , and for simplicity leaving @xmath110 .",
    "the loop expressions in this case are complicated and therefore we do not show them , but the final result is very simple , namely : @xmath111 we notice that the result is strongly dependent on the choice of @xmath23 .",

    "thus , in order to reproduce the result of the effective lagrangian from the microscopic calculation , one has to chose the chemical potentials in order to fulfill the neutrality conditions .    as explained in the previous section , when one computes the meson masses , one has to add to the lagrangian in eq .   the shift of the vacuum energy due to finite quark masses , related in the high effective theory to operators of order @xmath113 . in the cfl phase with massless quark propagators",

    "moreover we should notice that such kind of corrections vanish in the limit @xmath118 , which is the limit we are taking since in the neutrality conditions in use we do not consider the effect of the light quarks ; on the other hand , the effective chemical potential terms  ,   survive in this limiting case .",
    "for these reasons we do no longer discuss the contribution @xmath119 arising from to the anti - gap action , using for them the leading order results  ,  .",
    "as for the charged pions and the unflavored meson fields , at this order they are massless",
    ".    the complete lagrangian of the kaon modes at @xmath120 is thus given by @xmath121 the terms  ,   are usually referred as effective chemical potentials , as they enter into the meson lagrangian via a covariant derivative as a typical meson chemical potential does , @xmath122[(\\partial_0 - i\\mu_4)k^-]~.\\ ] ] since they give rise to a mass term with the wrong sign , when @xmath123 the ground state is unstable toward the formation of a kaon condensate  @xcite . in our approximation scheme , @xmath124 and @xmath125 ,",

    "this is the only way to properly reproduce the low energy effective action of ref .",

    "this is a necessary requirement of any calculation of the properties of the goldstone bosons : any violation of color neutrality in the microscopic model is translated , in the effective theory , into the presence of non - singlet fields in the low - energy lagrangian .",

    "we expect that these effects are important in the region @xmath155 , becoming less and less important when one approaches the onset of the cfl@xmath4gcfl transition where @xmath88 .",
    "moreover , also retaining the approximation @xmath14 , it would be fine to increase the strange quark mass beyond the onset cfl@xmath4gcfl , in order to understand the role of the gapless fermion excitations on the spectrum of the axial excitations . from the formal point of view",
    "it is sufficient to introduce the proper values of the charge and color chemical potentials , but a preliminary analysis shows that the numerical work required for this interesting project is much more involved than the one presented here . beside masses , the effective lagrangian parameters @xmath65 and @xmath148 should be evaluated in the gcfl regime : from the two flavor case we know that the squared velocities of some of the fields can be negative  @xcite , and this would lead to the goldstone currents studied in  @xcite . finally , last but not least , it would be interesting to extend the calculations to finite temperature .",
