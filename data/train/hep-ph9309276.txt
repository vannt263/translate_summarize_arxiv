    "there has recently been considerable attention focused on the applicability ( or otherwise ) of the leading twist perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) analysis in descriptions of exclusive processes at large momentum transfers .",
    "theoretical studies of such processes are typically justified on the basis of the factorization of the hard , perturbative and the soft , nonperturbative contributions to hadronic matrix elements .",
    "this factorization appears explicitly through the operator product expansion ( ope )  @xcite , where amplitudes are determined by the diagonal or almost diagonal matrix elements of nonlocal operators .",
    "it is applied to far - off - diagonal ( i.e. , large momentum transfer ) matrix elements of local operators in a parton model description of exclusive hadronic form factors  @xcite .",
    "the largest discrepancy between experimental data and the leading order perturbative calculations is observed in the predictions for absolute normalization of hadronic contributions to cross sections such as the k factor in the drell - yan process and electromagnetic form factors .",
    "this may be due to large corrections from next to leading order ( in @xmath4 ) terms and/or contributions from operators with higher dimension ( twist ) .",
    "for example , the pion electromagnetic ( e.m . ) form factor [ @xmath5 at large spacelike momentum transfer has been the subject of several studies , which showed that there were difficulties associated with the application of leading order pqcd arising from the appearance of intermediate states with small virtuality .",
    "these arise from the end - point region in the loop integration over the quark momenta  @xcite in what are necessarily assumed to be hard amplitudes . in particular",
    ", they may lead to large perturbative corrections , rendering the perturbative expansion inconsistent .",
    "recent analyses  @xcite have shown that the inclusion of sudakov - type corrections and transverse momenta in the analysis can suppress the unwanted end - point contributions and lead to a self consistent perturbative expansion for momentum transfers as low as a few gev .",

    "similarly , the lower ( upper ) dashed curves correspond to our prediction in the spacelike ( timelike ) regions when using the asymptotic distribution amplitude .",
    "the parameter @xmath76 was fixed from the known value of the normalization of the @xmath25 form factor at @xmath243 .",

    "it is worth noting that the difference in the pqcd and our predictions for the @xmath237 form factor below @xmath255 has opposite sign in the space- and timelike regions .",
    "this is due to the resonance structure in the timelike region which enhances the soft contributions and in particular introduces an imaginary part of the form factor .",
    "this feature is reproduced in our model and comes from the complex logarithm in eq .",
    "( [ ff ] ) for @xmath256 .",
    "as @xmath257 increases in the timelike region the two solid ( dashed ) curves cross and as @xmath258 they eventually merge as the imaginary part becomes negligible [ i.e. , @xmath259 .",
    "we have constructed a covariant , gauge - invariant @xmath1 amplitude for the pion in minkowski space using a perturbative integral representation .",
    "we have shown that confinement can be implemented in a straightforward way .",
    "we have also shown that this wavefunction can be readily connected to the usual pqcd treatment in the asymptotic regime .",
    "the main conclusions of our pion electromagnetic form factor analysis come from an examination of the curves in figs .",
    "[ pionff - fig ] and  [ rff ] .",
    "comparing our predictions with the pqcd ones we see that the influence of the soft pion wavefunction on the hard gluon exchange diagrams can produce large effects .",
    "for example , our calculation of the soft contributions is as large as @xmath260 of the purge pqcd result for @xmath261 when the cz distribution is used . for the asymptotic distribution",
    "our calculation of the soft contribution is @xmath262 .",
    "the incorporation of nonperturbative effects into a hard quark scattering calculation may be somewhat model dependent , but it seems clear that the effects _ can _ be very significant at intermediate momentum scales .",
    "previous treatments of this subject @xcite , dealt only with the pure pqcd formula of eq .",
    "( [ f - pqcd ] ) and in particular they manifestly break the hard - soft factorization as the size of the soft corrections is estimated by modifying the hard scattering amplitude by a soft gluon mass . on the other hand , in our approach we study the sensitivity of the form factors to the soft physics coming from the wavefunctions while keeping the hard amplitude perturbative .",
    "in addition , the present study has been an attempt to partially address the issues of lorentz covariance , gauge invariance , and the nonperturbative structure of the covariant amplitude of eq .",
    "( [ phi - pt ] ) .",
    "our results for the pion e.m .",
    "form factor appear to support the conclusion that the assumption of dominant pqcd contributions to the pion form factor at moderate @xmath144 is not well - founded .",
    "we have also shown that the covariant pion wavefunction can be directly related to the matrix element associated with the @xmath263 form factor .",
    "we have analyzed the extrapolation of this form factor away from the asymptotic region using the nonperturbative covariant pion wavefunction .",
    "once we fit @xmath264 , using the single nonperturbative scale parameter @xmath76 , we find that @xmath237 displays a much weaker dependence on the detailed form of the pion wavefunction even at low to moderate @xmath144 , ( i.e. , @xmath265  gev@xmath3 ) .",
    "in particular , we found that the relative , wavefunction - dependent , soft corrections to @xmath237 are less than @xmath266 for @xmath267 gev@xmath3 and become even smaller as @xmath249 increases .",
    "because of that and because the predictions for the form factor for different types of distribution amplitudes lead to different predictions , a precision measurement of the forward angle cross section for the @xmath268 transition would be of considerable interest , ( e.g. at cebaf ) . in particular , it may help resolve the question of large peaks predicted by chernyak and zhitnitsky for @xmath269 .    the apparently conflicting conclusions drawn from the results for the pion e.m",
    ". form factor @xmath10 and the @xmath0 from factor @xmath237 require cautious interpretation .",
    "the lesson to be learned from these simple model analyses may be that leading pqcd treatments can be relatively successful in describing exclusive amplitudes in the intermediate momentum regime based on the operator product expansion [ @xmath9 , but fail quite badly when there is no appropriate short distance expansion involved [ e.g. , @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "further studies along these lines will be needed before more definitive answers are possible .",
