    "the galactic center region is one of the richest regions in sources of the milky way .",
    "numerous x - ray  binaries , massive stellar clusters and supernova remnants ( hereafter , snrs ) lie in this complex region , immersed in an extended high - temperature plasma which heavily dominates the global soft x - ray  emission @xcite .",
    "recently , a diffuse x - ray  source , g0.570 - 0.018 , was detected with _",
    "asca _  and confirmed with _",
    "_  observations .",
    "the x - ray source has a ring - like structure , about 10  in radius , with a spectrum that can be fitted by a thermal emission model with a temperature of about 6  @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the high value derived for n@xmath3 ( @xmath4 10@xmath5 @xmath6 ) is consistent with a source located near the galactic center , at a distance of about 8 kpc .",
    "based on the detection of an iron line with a high equivalent width at 6.5  @xmath2 and a high fe abundance ( suggesting a recently shocked plasma ) , the authors concluded that the origin must be a very young snr with an age of @xmath4 80 yr . however , based on the analysis in the _ chandra _  image of a faint east - west x - ray tail possibly related to g0.570 - 0.018 , they conclude that it could be about twice older . in a snr scenario , we might expect non - thermal radio continuum emission from shock - accelerated electrons and the presence of @xmath0-ray  lines associated with the decay of @xmath1ti .",
    "this radioactive nucleus is thought to be exclusively produced in supernova ( hereafter , sn ) explosions .",
    "it is primarily generated in the @xmath7-rich freeze - out from nuclear statistical equilibrium occurring in the explosive silicon burning stage of core - collapse sne ( woosley & weaver 1995 ) , while a normal freeze - out si burning is at play in type ia sne @xcite .",
    "the radioactive decay chain @xmath1ti@xmath8@xmath1sc@xmath8@xmath1ca , with a lifetime of about 87.5 yr @xcite , produces three @xmath0-ray  lines at 67.9  @xmath2 , 78.4  @xmath2 ( from @xmath1sc@xmath9 ) and at 1157  @xmath2 ( from @xmath1ca@xmath9 ) with similar branching ratios .",
    "it has been shown that @xmath1ti may reveal young galactic snrs that could be hidden from our view at optical wavelengths due to heavy extinction in the galactic plane region .",
    "@xmath1ti @xmath0-ray   lines have been observed in the young snrs cassiopeia  a ( iyudin 1994 ; vink 2001 ; vink 2005 ) and rxj  0856 - 4622 @xcite .",
    "moreover , the radio data can provide information on the interaction of the blast wave with the circumstellar and local interstellar media .",
    "g0.570 - 0.018 is then an ideal case to search for specific signatures of young sne such as the @xmath1ti lines and the radio non - thermal radiation by combining both observations as early proposed by silberberg ( 1993 ) .    in this paper , based on the _ integral _  ( ibis / isgri , section [ s : isgri ] ) and vla ( section [ s : radio ] ) data , we investigate if g0.570 - 0.018 is indeed a young snr .",
    "if this is the case , its possible type and characteristics are discussed in section [ s : discuss ] at the light of all available observationnal and theoretical material .",
    "the international gamma - ray astrophysics laboratory _ integral _  @xcite is an esa mission carrying two main telescopes based on a coded aperture imaging system : ibis  @xcite and spi  @xcite .",
    "ibis  , with its soft @xmath0-ray   ( 15  @xmath2 - 1  @xmath10 ) imager isgri  @xcite , provides the finest imaging ( 13  fwhm ) and the best line sensitivity up to a few hundred  @xmath2 .",
    "it is therefore best suited for a search for the two low energy @xmath1ti lines and we only analyzed data from this instrument . _ integral _  is mainly devoted to the observation of galactic sources and spends considerable amount of time pointing towards the galactic plane and the galactic center regions .",
    "we performed the analysis of data from the galactic center deep exposure ( gcde ) of the core program , acquired during the first two years of _ integral _  operations . in a search for the radio counterpart for g0.570 - 0.018",
    ", we have reprocessed archival vla data at @xmath11 20  @xmath12 and 6  @xmath12 from different pointings where this source was within the field of view .",
    "we have also analyzed the 90  @xmath12 intermediate resolution vla image of the galactic center from larosa ( 2000 ) .",
    "both _ asca _  and _ chandra _  observations of g0.570 - 0.018 present a thermal x - ray  spectrum , without any evidence of synchrotron radiation .",
    "it is therefore highly improbable to detect this source with ibis  in the hard x - ray  continuum , above 15  @xmath2 .",
    "besides , as revealed by ibis / isgri , the galactic center region is a crowded area at hard x - ray  energies @xcite , making it more difficult to precisely distinguish the part of the emission which could be associated with this source .",
    "in fact we did not find any evidence of such emission in the 20 - 40  @xmath2 mosaic presented in blanger ( 2005 ) .",
    "we analyzed pointings where g0.570 - 0.018 lies within the field of view of ibis  ( @xmath14 15 ) , in the 65 - 71 and 75 - 82  @xmath2 energy bands centered on the two low energy @xmath1ti",
    "@xmath0-ray  lines , using the off - line scientific analysis ( osa ) software version 4.2 @xcite .",
    "these narrow bandwidths take full advantage of the isgri  energy resolution ( @xmath4 6  @xmath2 fwhm at 70  @xmath2 ) . the critical point in the analysis of the ibis / isgri data",
    "is the background subtraction : we have generated background shadowgrams ( detector image containing the shadow of the coded mask onto the isgri  detector ) by analyzing and summing a large part of the high - latitude and empty field observations performed during the first two years of the mission in 256 energy bands .",
    "the high total exposure time ( @xmath4 2  @xmath15 ) warrants the best removal of structures in the detector images @xcite , mainly around the k@xmath16 and k@xmath17 fluorescence lines of the w ( 59 and 65  @xmath2 ) and pb ( 75 and 85  @xmath2 ) located close to the two low energy @xmath1ti astrophysical lines .",
    "this method provides flat background - subtracted detector images in any desired energy band .",
    "thus , the convolution of these shadowgrams with a decoding array derived from the spatial characteristics of the coded mask produces good quality reconstructed sky images .",
    "we finally obtained two mosaic images in these two energy bands and combined both to increase the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the resulting mosaic is shown in figure [ f:44ti_ima ] , with a final exposure time towards the source of about 4.3 ms .",
    "we found no evidence for any emission above 3@xmath18 from g0.570 - 0.018 in the @xmath1ti @xmath0-ray  lines range and estimated an upper limit of 1.2 @xmath19 10@xmath20 @xmath6 s@xmath21 at the 3@xmath18 confidence level .",
    "this can be converted into an upper limit on the @xmath1ti yield via the following equation :    @xmath22\\times{10^{-4}~\\mathrm{m}_{\\odot}}}\\ ] ]    where y@xmath23 is the @xmath1ti yield , f@xmath24 the @xmath1ti line flux and @xmath25 the @xmath1ti lifetime @xmath4 87.5 yr @xcite .",
    "assuming that g0.570 - 0.018 is located near the galactic center region , a distance of 8 kpc is adopted @xcite . based on this assumption , we obtained the relation between the maximal @xmath1ti yield and the age of this source presented in figure [ f : y_age ] .",

    "the image at 20  @xmath12 was obtained from archival data corresponding to observations carried out using the vla in the hybrid cnb configuration for about 1.5 hours on 2004 february .",
    "the data were processed under the miriad software package @xcite following standard procedures .",
    "the resulting synthesized beam is 13@xmath19 8 , pa=54.6 , and the average rms noise of the order of 2.5 mjy / beam .",

    "a field around g0.570 - 0.018 is shown in figure [ f : radio_im]b , with a few contours superimposed representing the _ chandra _  x - ray  emission smoothed to the same angular resolution as the radio image .",

    "@xmath12 we used archival data from observations carried out with the vla - d array during 45 minutes on 2003 april 30 .",
    "the synthesized beam is 27@xmath19 11 , pa=-5.2 and the average rms noise in the field , about 2.2 mjy / beam .",

    "chandra _",
    "x - ray  contours overlapped .    the image shown in figure [ f : radio_im]a at 90  @xmath12",
    "was extracted from the 4@xmath19 4  image of the center of the galaxy obtained with the vla b , c and d configurations ( larosa et al .",
    "the angular resolution of these data is 48@xmath19 48  and the rms sensitivity of 5.9 mjy / beam .",
    "the largest angular scale to which this image is sensitive is approximately 45 .    from these images , it is apparent that g0.570 - 0.018 lies on a region with tenuous , smooth radio emission .",
    "not any conspicuous radio feature can be associated with the x - ray  source at any frequency up to the limit of the angular resolution and sensitivity of these images .",
    "an upper limit for the flux densities at 90 and 20  @xmath12 can be estimated by integrating the radio emission over a region with the size of the outer x - ray  contour . from this integration",
    "we estimate : s@xmath28 jy and s@xmath29 jy .",
    "although the flux contribution from large - scale structures was not added to these images , the flux density estimates are reliable within observational errors because the size of the studied structure is smaller than the largest well imaged structure at the respective frequencies .",
    "this is not the case for the emission at 6  @xmath12 , thus it was not possible to accurately estimate the flux density at this short wavelength .",
    "the x - ray  morphology and spectra of g0.570 - 0.018 show a hot - temperature plasma distributed in a ring - like structure , two characteristic features of young ejecta - dominated snrs . in this context",
    ", we attempted to shed further light on the nature of this source searching for @xmath1ti @xmath0-ray  lines and radio continuum emission .",
    "however , to our surprise neither the @xmath1ti @xmath0-ray  lines observations nor the radio continuum maps reveal any feature that can be ascribed to g0.570 - 0.018 at the levels of sensitivity presented above .    concerning sne nucleosynthesis products such as @xmath1ti , presupernova evolutions and calculations of explosive yields have a long history .",
    "recently , core - collapse sne have been studied by woosley & weaver ( 1995 ) , thielemann ( 1996 ) , rauscher ( 2002 , hereafter rhhw02 ) and limongi & chieffi ( 2003 , hereafter lc03 ) while nucleosynthesis in chandrasekhar mass models for type ia sne can be found in iwamoto ( 1999 ) .",
    "the @xmath1ti yields used in this paper were extracted from those obtained by rhhw02 and lc03 since their calculations include several improvements in stellar physics and revised nuclear reaction rates .",
    "figure [ f : models ] shows these @xmath1ti yields as a function of the energy of the explosion , for different masses of the progenitor with our 3@xmath18 upper limit for the two possible ages of g0.570 - 0.018 .",

    "each color is related to the mass of the progenitor .",
    "horizontal lines represent our 3@xmath18 upper limit for two different ages of g0.570 - 0.018 .",
    "[ f : models ] ]    explosive yields are sensitive to many details of the explosion and in the case of core - collapse sne , @xmath1ti is thought to be created close to the mass - cut ( the mass above which the matter falls back onto the compact remnant ) . from figure",
    "[ f : models ] it can be seen that for each track of constant progenitor mass , the higher is the energy of the explosion , the larger is the ejected mass of @xmath1ti . for an age of 80 yr",
    ", our 3@xmath18 upper limit is only compatible with few models of core - collapse sne , where the energy is unsufficient to eject an amount of @xmath1ti above 2 @xmath19 10@xmath20  @xmath27 .",
    "we also considered the expected @xmath1ti yields in various chandrasekhar mass models for snia explosions ( iwamoto 1999 and references therein ) . in these models ,",
    "explosive nucleosynthesis is calculated for a variety of deflagration speeds and ignition densities .",
    "we find that `` standards '' models ( nomoto 1984 ; thielemann 1986 ) predict @xmath1ti yields clearly below our 3@xmath18 upper limit , while delayed - detonation models with highly energetic explosions ( @xmath31 1.4 @xmath19 10@xmath30 ergs ) predict @xmath1ti yields between @xmath4 3 and 4.5 @xmath19 10@xmath20  @xmath27 which could be compatible only in the case where g0.570 - 0.018 is at least two times older ( @xmath31 160 yr ) .",
    "the situation is worse in the case of sub - chandrasekhar snia explosions where helium burns in a detonation wave causing a detonation also in the interior of the white dwarf ( woosley 1986 ; woosley & weaver 1994 ) . in such systems , substantial overproductions of @xmath1ti from several",
    "10@xmath26  @xmath27 up to 4 @xmath19 10@xmath32  @xmath27 are expected and then well above our sensitivity . in summary , comparing our upper limits with various models , we conclude that only few sub - energetic core - collapse or standard thermonuclear explosions predict @xmath1ti yields that explain our non - detection at the ibis / isgri sensitivity .    from an observational point of view , the 1.157  @xmath10 @xmath1ti @xmath0-ray  line was detected for the first time in cas  a with _",
    "gro_/comptel @xcite .",
    "later , vink ( 2001 ) reported the detection with _ bepposax_/pds of the two low energy @xmath1ti lines in this snr implying an initial @xmath1ti mass of ( 0.8 - 2.5 ) @xmath19 10@xmath26  @xmath27 .",
    "preliminary analysis of the ibis / isgri data on cas  a yielded a detection of the 68 kev @xmath1ti line with a flux consistent with the _ bepposax _  detections @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is suspected that the late - time light curve of sn  1987a ( @xmath33 2000 days ) is dominated by the @xmath1ti decay . from time - dependent models for the light curve in combination with broad band photometry ,",
    "fransson & kozma ( 2001 ) estimated a @xmath1ti mass of ( 0.5 - 2.0 ) @xmath19 10@xmath26  @xmath27 . on the other hand , senda ( 2002 )",
    "noticed similarities between the x - ray  structure of the ring of g0.570 - 0.018 and that of sn  1987a where strong stellar winds might produce a gas ring being heated by sn ejecta .",
    "however , one can see from figure [ f : y_age ] that g0.570 - 0.018 should have been detected in the @xmath1ti @xmath0-ray  lines range if it had emitted yields comparable to those measured from cas  a or those inferred from sn  1987a , even in the worst case of considering the lower limits of @xmath1ti yields , and the oldest age of 160 yr .    concerning the radio observations",
    ", one can expect synchrotron emission coming from either initially accelerated or shock - accelerated electrons and the non - observation at any radio frequency of g0.570 - 0.018 is then surprising .",
    "if g0.570 - 0.018 has an age of 80 yr , it should be considered as an `` intermediate - age '' supernova ( see eck 2002 and references therein ) evolving from sn to snr .",
    "g0.570 - 0.018 , however , could be as old as 160 yr .",
    "with such an upper limit on the age , we can not exclude that g0.570 - 0.018 is in the snr phase where the electrons responsible for the radio synchroton emission are accelerated at the shock front .",
    "the main difficulty of the studies of radio emission from sne / snrs is that between the observed extragalactic radio sne ( hereafter , rsne ) and the youngest known galactic snr ( cas  a ) , there is an observationnal gap of about 300 yr and then the evolution from rsn to snr is poorly understood .",
    "type ii sne seem to be well described by chevalier s models ( chevalier 1982a , 1982b , 1984 ) where the radio emission is related to the circumstellar matter while that of older sne , entering the snr phase ( predicted to take at least 100 yr ) , can be related to the amount of interstellar matter ( gull 1973 ; cowsik & sarkar 1984 ) .",
    "emission mechanisms in both cases are anyway identical .",
    "thus , we have divided our discussion in two parts , one considering that g0.570 - 0.018 is still a sn and an other assuming that it could be a very young snr .    in the first case , according to the chevalier s model @xcite , the flux of rsne drastically depends on the ratio between the mass - loss rate of the pre - sn progenitor and the wind speed . for small values ,",
    "no strong radio emission is expected , thus explaining why despite several searches ( eck 1995 ) , no type ia sne have been detected in radio and why most of the extragalactic sne seen at radio wavelenghts ( weiler 2002 ) have progenitors with dense winds .",
    "massive stars are thought to experience strong mass losses during the final stages of their evolution implying that they would be bright radio sources .",
    "our non - detection in radio therefore points to the lower progenitor masses .",
    "figure [ f : models ] shows that for these lower masses , our upper limit on the production of @xmath1ti favours rather low energetic events . on the other hand",
    ", g0.57 - 0.018 could be similar to the type ia sn  1885a in m31 , the first extragalactic sn identified , where no radio emission has been found @xcite .",
    "now if we assume that g0.57 - 0.018 has an age of 160 yr , it can be considered as a very young snr @xcite .",
    "recently , asvarov ( 2000 ) developed a model based on the diffusive shock acceleration mechanism to explain radio emission of adiabatic snrs and compared its modeled surface brightness - diameter ( @xmath34 - d ) evolutionary tracks with the empirical @xmath34 - d diagram .",
    "he found that adiabatic snrs evolve at nearly constant surface brightness : @xmath34 @xmath35 d@xmath36 .",
    "we have used this relation and compared the surface brightness of the historical snrs kepler , tycho , cas  a and sn  1006 ( we exclude the crab nebula and 3c58 because they are continuously fed by relativistic electrons from a central neutron star ) as given by green ( 2005 ) and scaled to an age of 160 yr , with our upper limit at 20  @xmath12 , @xmath37 2 @xmath19 10@xmath38 w m@xmath39 hz@xmath21 sr@xmath21 .",
    "the only concordance found is with sn1006 , suggesting that g0.570 - 0.018 might be a type ia snr evolving in a low - density medium .",
    "this is consistent with our upper limit on the @xmath1ti yield , since standard type ia sne produce in average less @xmath1ti than core - collapse sne , and with its very low radio flux density .",
    "although snia can be found at any location in spiral galaxies like the milky way , the location of g0.570 - 0.018 within the disk and close to the galactic center , which is known to host abundant molecular material and young stars @xcite , makes the scenario of a core - collapse event more likely . in any case",
    "g0.570 - 0.018 must be located in a region probably depleted by a succession of strong stellar winds of massive stars and/or previous sn explosions .    in any scenario of a sn / snr , a possible explanation for the lack of radio emission can be the fact that g0.570 - 0.018 appears to be evolving in a low density hot plasma . in such medium high mach numbers shocks may not be formed , even if velocities are high , as the sound speed in a hot plasma is also high .",
    "such snr shocks will not give rise to high compression ratios , and also shock acceleration may be less efficient . therefore , the radio emission may not be very strong .",
    "in addition , if the snr shock expands within a bubble blown out by the wind of the precursor star , the possibility of creating a radio synchrotron shell is even lower .",
    "in conclusion , the present @xmath0-ray  and radio observations have not solved the basic question if g0.57 - 0.018 is a genuine sn / snr .",
    "if it is , then our upper limits on the ejected @xmath1ti mass and radio emission from g0.57 - 0.018 help to constrain its characteristics : the weak production of @xmath1ti rules out all the sub - chandrasekhar type ia sn scenarios and can be explained if g0.57 - 0.018 was a sub - energetic core - collapse supernova from a moderate mass progenitor or a standard thermonuclear explosion . since no type ia sne in radio",
    "have been detected , the second scenario looks more likely although the location of g0.57 - 0.018 , very close to the galactic center , might suggest a massive star progenitor . according to chevalier s model , the very weak radio surface brightness is probably due to the low - density surrounding medium .",
    "if the sn / snr nature of g0.57 - 0.018 is questioned , then the x - ray   morphology , the high fe abundance and the position and width of the fe line observed by senda ( 2002 ) remain to be explained . in any scenario of a young sn / snr",
    ", g0.57 - 0.018 seems to be unusual and only the next generation of hard x - ray  /soft",
    "@xmath0-ray  focusing telescopes , such as _ simbol - x _  @xcite , will be in position to disentangle its nature .",

    "<S> we report _ integral_/ibis  @xmath0-ray  and vla radio observations of g0.570 - 0.018 , a diffuse x - ray  source recently discovered by _ asca _  and _ chandra _  in the galactic center region . based on its spectrum and morphology , </S>",
    "<S> g0.570 - 0.018 has been proposed to be a very young supernova remnant . in this scenario , </S>",
    "<S> the presence of @xmath0-ray  lines coming from the short - lived radioactive nucleus @xmath1ti as well as synchrotron radio continuum emission are expected . </S>",
    "<S> the first could provide informations on nucleosynthesis environments in the interior of exploding stars , the latter could probe the interaction between the supernova blast wave and the circumstellar / interstellar matter . </S>",
    "<S> we have not detected @xmath1ti lines nor any conspicuous radio feature associated with this source down to the achieved sensitivities . from the derived upper limits we set constraints on the nature of g0.570 - 0.018 . </S>"
