    "in the 60 s j. p. serre showed in @xcite that there exists a field automorphism @xmath4 , and a variety @xmath2 defined over @xmath5 such that @xmath2 and the galois conjugate variety @xmath3 have non isomorphic fundamental groups , in particular they are not homeomorphic .    in this note , using completely different methods , we show the following two results , which give a strong sharpening of the phenomenon discovered by serre .",
    "the absolute galois group @xmath0 acts faithfully on the set of connected components of the ( coarse ) moduli spaces of minimal surfaces of general type .",
    "assume that @xmath6 is different from the identity and from complex conjugation .",
    "then there is a minimal surface of general type @xmath2 such that @xmath2 and @xmath3 have non isomorphic fundamental groups .    in order",
    "not to get confused by the above two statements , note that while the absolute galois group @xmath0 acts on the set of connected components of the ( coarse ) moduli spaces of minimal surfaces of general type , it does not act on the set of isomorphism classes of fundamental groups of surfaces of general type .",
    "observe that obviously complex conjugation does not change the isomorphism class of the fundamental group ( @xmath2 and @xmath7 are diffeomorphic ) . now",
    ", if we had an action on the set of isomorphism classes of fundamental groups , then all the normal closure of the @xmath8 generated by complex conjugation would act trivially .",
    "this would contradict theorem 2 since complex conjugation does not lie in the centre of @xmath0 .",
    "the surfaces we consider in this note are the socalled surfaces isogenous to a product whose weak rigidity was proven in @xcite , and which by definition are the quotient of a product of curves ( @xmath9 ) by the free action of a finite group @xmath10 .",
    "therefore our method is strictly related to the socalled theory of dessins d enfants ( see @xcite ) .",
    "dessins d enfants are , in view of riemann s existence theorem ( generalized by grauert and remmert in @xcite ) , a combinatorial way to look at the monodromies of algebraic functions with only three branch points .",
    "it goes without saying that we make here an essential use of belyi functions ( @xcite ) and of their functoriality",
    ".    it would be interesting to obtain similar types of results with examples involving rigid varieties belonging to the class of varieties isogenous to a product .",
    "for instance we expect that similar results also hold if we restrict ourselves to consider only the socalled beauville surfaces ( see @xcite for the definition of beauville surfaces and @xcite,@xcite , @xcite for further properties of these ) .    in the last section we use beauville surfaces and polynomials with two critical values in order to produce simple examples of pairs of surfaces with nonisomorphic fundamental groups which are conjugate under the absolute galois group ( hence the two groups have isomorphic profinite completions ) .",
    "fix a positive integer @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and define , for any complex number @xmath13 , @xmath14 as the hyperelliptic curve of genus @xmath15 @xmath16 branched over @xmath17 .",

    "in fact , this projectivity @xmath29 is defined over @xmath30 , since there are three rational numbers which are carried into three rational numbers ( since @xmath31 ) .    since @xmath32 it follows that @xmath33 and @xmath29 maps @xmath34 to @xmath35 , and in particular @xmath29 has finite order .",
    "since @xmath29 either leaves the cyclical order of @xmath36 invariant or reverses it , and @xmath12 we see that there are @xmath37 consecutive integers such that @xmath29 maps them to @xmath37 consecutive integers .",

    "<S> we show that the galois group @xmath0 operates faithfully on the set of connected components of the moduli spaces of surfaces of general type , and also that for each element @xmath1 different from the identity and from complex conjugation , there is a surface of general type such that @xmath2 and the galois conjugate variety @xmath3 have nonisomorphic fundamental groups . </S>",
    "<S> the result was announced by the second author at the alghero conference topology of algebraic varieties in september 2006 . </S>",
    "<S> before the present paper was actually written , we received a very interesting preprint by robert easton and ravi vakil ( @xcite ) , where it is proven , with a completely different type of examples , that the galois group @xmath0 operates faithfully on the set of irreducible components of the moduli spaces of surfaces of general type . </S>",
    "<S> we also give other simpler examples of surfaces with nonisomorphic fundamental groups which are galois conjugate , hence have isomorphic algebraic fundamental groups . </S>"
