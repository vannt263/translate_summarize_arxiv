    "the asymptotic iteration method ( aim ) is an iterative algorithm for the solution of sturm  liouville equations  @xcite .",
    "although this method does not seem to be better than other existing approaches , it has been applied to quantum ",
    "mechanical  @xcite as well as mathematical problems  @xcite .",
    "for example , the aim has proved suitable for obtaining both accurate approximate and exact eigenvalues  @xcite and it has also been applied to the calculation of rayleigh  schrdinger perturbation coefficients  @xcite .",
    "recently , barakat applied the aim to a coulomb potential with a radial polynomial perturbation  @xcite . by means of a well  known transformation he converted the perturbed coulomb problem into an anharmonic oscillator . since straightforward application of the aim exhibited considerable oscillations and did not appear to converge barakat resorted to perturbation theory in order to obtain acceptable results @xcite .",
    "it is most surprising that the straightforward application of the aim failed for the anharmonic oscillator studied by barakat  @xcite since it had been found earlier that the approach should be accurate in such cases  @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to verify whether the aim gives accurate eigenvalues of the perturbed coulomb model or if its sequences are oscillatory divergent as mentioned above .",
    "we also discuss the application of perturbation theory to that model .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we present the model and discuss useful scaling relations for the potential parameters . in sec .",
    "[ sec : aim ] we apply the aim to the perturbed coulomb model directly ; that is to say we do not convert it into an anharmonic oscillator . in sec .",
    "[ sec : pt ] we outline alternative perturbation approaches , and in sec .  [ sec : concl ] we interpret our results and draw conclusions .",
    "the problem studied by barakat  @xcite is given by the following radial schrdinger equation @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the angular  momentum quantum number , and the boundary conditions are @xmath2 .",
    "we restrict to the case @xmath3 in order to have only bound states ; on the other hand , @xmath4 and @xmath5 can take any finite real value .",
    "it is most useful to take into account the scaling relations @xmath6 notice that we can set either @xmath4 or @xmath7 equal to unity without loss of generality , and that , for example , @xmath8 . following barakat  @xcite we choose @xmath9 to be the radial quantum number , and",
    "we may define a `` principal '' quantum number @xmath10 .",
    "barakat mentions that straightforward application of the aim does not give reasonable results because the sequences oscillate when the number of iteration is greater than @xmath11 approximately  @xcite .",
    "this conclusion is surprising because it has been shown that the aim yields accurate results for anharmonic oscillators  @xcite , and barakat converted the perturbed coulomb model into one of them@xcite . in this section",
    "we apply the aim directly to the original radial schrdinger equation ( [ eq : schro ] ) .    by means of the transformation",
    "@xmath12 we convert the perturbed coulomb model ( [ eq : schro ] ) into a sturm  liouville equation for @xmath13 : @xmath14-\\frac{\\phi ^{\\prime \\prime } ( r)}{\\phi ( r)}\\right\\ } ,   \\label{eq : st_li_gen}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is arbitrary .",
    "it seems reasonable to choose @xmath16 that resembles the asymptotic behaviour of the eigenfunction for a harmonic oscillator when @xmath17 or for a coulomb interaction when @xmath18 .",
    "it leads to @xmath19 we can set the values of the two free parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 to obtain the greatest rate of convergence of the aim sequences . from now",
    "on we call asymptotic values of @xmath20 and @xmath21 to such values of those parameters that remove the terms of @xmath22 that dominate at large @xmath23 ; that is to say : @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "since the asymptotic values of the free parameters do not necessarily lead to the greatest convergence rate@xcite , in what follows we will also look for optimal values of @xmath20 .    the sturm  liouville equation ( [ eq : st_li_gen ] ) with the functions @xmath26 and @xmath22 ( [ eq : p(r)_q(r ) ] ) is suitable for the application of the aim .",
    "we do not show the aim equations here because they have been developed and discussed elsewhere@xcite .",
    "since the aim quantization condition depends not only on the energy but also on the variable @xmath23 for non  exactly solvable problems , we have to choose a convenient value for the latter@xcite .",
    "later on we will discuss the effect of the value of @xmath23 on the convergence of the method ; for the time being we follow barakat  @xcite and select the positive root of @xmath27 : @xmath28    for concreteness we restrict to @xmath29 and @xmath30 , and select @xmath31 from barakat s paper@xcite . as expected from earlier calculations on anharmonic oscillators  @xcite ,",
    "the rate of convergence of the aim depends on the value of @xmath20 . in order to investigate this point we choose @xmath32 because it is the most difficult of all the cases considered here .",
    "more precisely , we focus on the behaviour of the logarithmic error @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the aim energy at iteration @xmath35 and @xmath36 was obtained by means of the rapidly converging riccati  pad method ( rpm )  @xcite from sequences of determinants of dimension @xmath37 through @xmath38 .",
    "we first consider the asymptotic value @xmath39 .",
    "[ fig : asympt ] shows that @xmath40 decreases rapidly with @xmath35 when @xmath41 and then more slowly but more smoothly for @xmath42 . in the transition region about @xmath43 we observe oscillations that can mislead one into believing that the aim starts to diverge .",
    "[ fig : optimal ] shows that the behaviour of @xmath40 for a nearly optimal value @xmath44 is similar to the previous case , except that the transition takes place at a larger value of @xmath35 and the convergence rate is greater .",
    "more precisely , @xmath40 decreases rapidly with @xmath35 when @xmath45 approximately as @xmath46 and more slowly and smoothly for @xmath47 as @xmath48 .",
    "again , the transition region exhibits oscillations .",
    "table  [ tab : table2 ] shows the ground ",
    "state energies for @xmath31 and the corresponding nearly optimal values of @xmath20 .",
    "we estimated those eigenvalues from the sequences of aim roots for @xmath49 through @xmath50 .",
    "notice that the optimal values of @xmath20 in table  [ tab : table2 ] depend on @xmath5 and do not agree with the asymptotic value @xmath51 .",
    "table  [ tab : table2 ] also shows that the aim eigenvalues agree with those calculated by means of the rpm  @xcite from sequences of determinants of dimension @xmath37 through @xmath52 .",
    "the rate of convergence also depends on the chosen value of @xmath23 .",
    "the calculation of @xmath40 as a function of @xmath53 shows that @xmath54 exhibits a minimum at @xmath55 and that @xmath55 increases with @xmath35 approximately as @xmath56 ( for @xmath32 ) .",
    "however , in order to keep the application of the aim as simple as possible we just choose @xmath57 for all the calculations .",
    "barakat  @xcite first converted the radial schrdinger equation ( [ eq : schro ] ) into another one for an anharmonic oscillator by means of the standard transformations @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "finally , he derived the sturm ",
    "liouville problem @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 , through factorization of the asymptotic behaviour of the solution : @xmath63 notice that present @xmath20 and barakat s @xmath20 are not exactly the same but they have a close meaning and are related by @xmath64 . since barakat s application of the aim to eq .",
    "( [ eq : sl_u ] ) did not appear to converge  @xcite he opted for a perturbation approach that consists of rewriting eq .",
    "( [ eq : sl_u ] ) as @xmath65 f(u)=0 \\label{eq : sl_u_pt}\\ ] ] and expanding the solutions in powers of @xmath66 : @xmath67 the perturbation parameter @xmath66 is set equal to unity at the end of the calculation .",
    "the series for the energy exhibits considerable convergence rate and consequently barakat obtained quite accurate results with just two to five perturbation corrections  @xcite .",
    "barakat calculated the coefficient @xmath68 exactly and all the others approximately  @xcite .",
    "the model ( [ eq : schro ] ) is suitable for several alternative implementations of perturbation theory in which we simply write @xmath69 and expand the solutions in powers of @xmath70 .    if we choose @xmath71 ( when @xmath72 ) and @xmath73 then we can calculate all the perturbation coefficients exactly by means of well known algorithms  @xcite .",
    "one easily realizes that the perturbation series can be rearranged as @xmath74 it is well known that this series is asymptotic divergent for all values of the potential parameters .",
    "the other reasonable perturbation split of the potential energy is @xmath75 , @xmath76 . in this case",
    "we can rearrange the series as @xmath77 one expects that this series has a finite radius of convergence .",
    "this is exactly the series obtained by barakat  @xcite by means of the aim and , consequently , it is not surprising that he derived accurate results from it . in this case one can obtain exact perturbation corrections at least for the first two energy coefficients .    for simplicity",
    "we concentrate on the states with @xmath78 .",
    "the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of order zero are @xmath79 respectively . with the unperturbed eigenfunctions one easily obtains the perturbation correction of first order to the energy @xmath80 that is the term of the series ( [ eq : e_series_lambda ] ) with @xmath81 .",
    "one can easily carry out the same calculation for the states with @xmath82 using the appropriate eigenfunctions of the harmonic oscillator .",
    "equation ( [ eq : e^(1 ) ] ) yields all the numerical results for @xmath83 in tables 1 - 3 of barakat s paper  @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xmath84 when @xmath85 as in table 1 of barakat s paper  @xcite .",
    "this particular relationship between the potential parameters also leads to exact solutions of the eigenvalue equation ( [ eq : schro ] ) .",
    "some of them are given by @xmath86 where @xmath87 is a normalization constant .",
    "we have shown that the aim converges for the perturbed coulomb model if the values of the free parameters in the factor function that converts the schrdinger equation into a sturm ",
    "liouville one are not too far from optimal .",
    "it is clear that it is not necessary to transform the perturbed coulomb model into an anharmonic oscillator for a successful application of the aim .",
    "our results do not exhibit the oscillatory divergence reported by barakat@xcite even when choosing the asymptotic value of @xmath88 .",
    "the perturbation approach proposed by barakat  @xcite is equivalent to choosing the harmonic oscillator as unperturbed or reference hamiltonian , and if we apply perturbation theory to the original radial schrdinger equation we easily obtain two energy coefficients exactly instead of just only one .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the coefficients calculated by barakat  @xcite are quite accurate and , consequently , the resulting series provide a suitable approach for the eigenvalues of the perturbed coulomb potential .",
    "this application of the aim to perturbation theory is certainly much more practical than the calculation of exact perturbation corrections proposed earlier  @xcite that can certainly be carried out more efficiently by other approaches  @xcite ."
