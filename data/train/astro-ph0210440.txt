    "the substantial eccentricity , @xmath6 , of pluto s orbit is well explained by malhotra s ( 1995 ) theory of resonant capture by neptune . in this scenario ,",
    "neptune migrated radially outwards from the sun by scattering planetesimals towards jupiter , captured pluto into its 3:2 mean - motion resonance , and amplified @xmath6 upon continuing its migration .",
    "the resonant amplification of @xmath6 can be understood either mechanistically using gauss s equations ( see , e.g. , peale 1986 ) , or in terms of the preservation of an adiabatic invariant ( see , e.g. , yu & tremaine 2001 ) .",
    "the discovery of dozens of kuiper belt objects ( kbos ) that share the 3:2 neptunian resonance with pluto and that also exhibit large orbital eccentricities ( jewitt & luu 2000 ) apparently vindicates this proposal that neptune plowed its way outwards through a field of planetesimals early in the history of the solar system ( fernandez & ip 1984 ) .    in the particular numerical simulation presented by malhotra ( 1995 ) , the 2:1 neptunian resonance",
    "is predicted to be about as equally populated as the 3:2 resonance . for brevity",
    ", we will refer to kbos in the latter resonance as `` plutinos '' and kbos in the former resonance as `` twotinos . '' as of july 4 , 2002 , the minor planet center ( mpc ) database contains @xmath041 plutino candidates ( objects observed at multiple oppositions having fitted semi - major axes , @xmath7 , within 0.3 au of the exact 3:2 resonance location at @xmath8 ) , and @xmath05 twotino candidates ( objects whose @xmath7 s lie within 0.3 au of the exact 2:1 resonance location at @xmath9 ) .",
    "the twotino candidates possess substantial orbital eccentricities , @xmath10@xmath11 , in accord with the predictions of resonant capture and migration .",
    "membership in a resonance is confirmed by verifying that the appropriate resonant argument librates rather than circulates ( see  [ gencon ] ) ; an orbit classification scheme based on this more rigorous criterion is currently being developed by the deep ecliptic survey ( des ) team ( see millis et al .",
    "for the present paper , we will consider the _ observed _ twotinos to be outnumbered by the _ observed _ plutinos by a factor of @xmath12 .",
    "part of this bias must simply reflect the fact that @xmath13 ; all other factors being equal , more distant objects are fainter and more difficult to detect .",
    "but part of this bias may also reflect selection effects that depend on the longitude and latitude of observation .",
    "a mean - motion resonant object will be preferentially found at certain locations with respect to neptune  what we will call `` sweet spots '' on the sky .",
    "the sweet spots for twotinos are not necessarily those of plutinos .",
    "ida et al .  ( 2000 ) point out that neptune s ability to resonantly capture objects varies with migration timescale .",
    "a migration timescale that is 20 times shorter than that considered by malhotra ( 1995 ) is found to severely reduce the probability of capture into the 2:1 resonance .",
    "for the 3:2 resonance , the capture probability is affected less dramatically by reductions in the migration timescale .",
    "the relative robustness of the 3:2 resonance compared to the 2:1 resonance is explored analytically by friedland ( 2001 ) , who underscores the importance of the indirect potential for the latter resonance .",
    "this paper quantifies , within the confines of the model of resonant migration , the bias against finding kbos in the 2:1 resonance over those in the 3:2 resonance . in  [ gencon ] , we set forth general , model - independent considerations for calculating this bias . in  [ migmod ] , we describe in detail the results of a particular simulation of resonant migration . in this section ,",
    "we present illustrative snapshots of the instantaneous spatial distributions of twotinos and of plutinos . in  [ vary ] , we explore how our results change by varying the migration rate of neptune . in  [ conc ] , we discuss our theoretical results in the context of the observations .",
    "there , we begin to examine critically the belief that plutinos intrinsically outnumber twotinos .",
    "a summary of our main findings is provided in  [ summa ] .",
    "our computations may serve not only to de - bias extant observations and thereby constrain the true relative resonant populations , but also to guide future observational surveys .",
    "the ability of an observational survey to detect kbos residing within a given resonance depends on the kbos ( 1 ) spatial distribution , and ( 2 ) size and albedo distributions . in this section ,",
    "we offer comments regarding the former consideration .      by definition ,",
    "an object inhabits a @xmath14:@xmath15 outer neptunian resonance if the resonant argument ,    @xmath16    librates ( undergoes a bounded oscillation about a particular angle ) . here",
    "@xmath15 is a positive integer , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the mean longitude and longitude of periastron of the object , respectively , and @xmath19 is the mean longitude of neptune .",
    "a restricted range for @xmath20 implies that the resonant particle will most likely be found at particular longitudes with respect to neptune .",
    "for example , if an object inhabits the @xmath21 resonance such that @xmath22 librates about @xmath23 with a negligibly small libration amplitude , then such an object attains perihelion when neptune is @xmath23 away in longitude .",
    "the eccentricity of the resonant object may be so large that the orbits of neptune and of the particle cross , but the particle avoids close encounters with neptune by virtue of the boundedness of @xmath22 .",
    "it has been remarked that because @xmath24 for pluto and the plutinos librates about a mean value of @xmath25 , these objects tend to be found at longitudes displaced @xmath3 from neptune when they reach perihelion and are at their brightest ( e.g. , jewitt , luu , & trujillo 1998 ) .",
    "this argument is not strictly correct ; it neglects the plutinos often substantial libration amplitudes , @xmath26 .",
    "just as a librating pendulum is most likely found near the turning points of its trajectory , a plutino s resonant argument is most likely found near @xmath27 or near @xmath28 , not @xmath29 .",
    "figures [ toy32]a and [ toy32]b portray two toy models for the spatial distributions of 3:2 resonant objects . they demonstrate that the spatial distribution of resonant particles is sensitive to the distribution of libration amplitudes , @xmath30 , and not just to the value of the libration center , @xmath31 . for each panel ,",
    "the instantaneous locations of 15000 co - planar particles are calculated according to the following scheme : semi - major axes are randomly chosen from a uniform distribution between 39.0 and 39.8 au , mean longitudes are randomly drawn from a uniform distribution between @xmath32 and @xmath33 , and eccentricities are randomly selected from a uniform distribution between 0.1 and 0.3 .",
    "resonant arguments of particles are taken to equal @xmath34 , where the upper and lower signs are equally probable and @xmath35 is randomly drawn from a uniform distribution between @xmath32 and @xmath33 . for figure [ toy32]a ,",
    "@xmath26 is randomly selected from a uniform distribution between @xmath36 and @xmath37 , and for figure [ toy32]b , the underlying distribution for @xmath26 is given by the solid histogram in figure [ histo32allin1 ] .",
    "the longitude of perihelion of each particle is calculated according to @xmath38 , where @xmath19 is assigned its present - day value of 302@xmath39 .",
    "the resultant plots illustrate two ways that plutinos could be distributed , both of which are possible in principle . in figure",
    "[ toy32]a , the objects cluster in 4 locations , respecting the @xmath40 turning points of the resonant argument2 turning points for each of the 2 libration centers , @xmath41 .",
    "thus , it is not true _ a priori _ that 3:2 resonant objects must cluster at only two locations in the sky .",
    "by contrast , in figure [ toy32]b , there are enough small - amplitude librators @xmath42 that the concentration of objects does gently peak at longitudes @xmath3 away from neptune , in abeyance with the usual expectation .",
    "toy models such as these are useful for analyzing the results of numerical orbit integrations . in anticipation of such integrations",
    ", we present figure [ toy21 ] , which displays a toy model for the distribution of twotinos .",
    "the parameters of the model are described in the figure caption .",
    "secular resonances might also play a role in determining the spatial distribution of kbos .",
    "chief among these are kozai - type resonances in which @xmath43 , the argument of perihelion , librates about particular angles , usually @xmath3 , @xmath32 , or @xmath23 .",
    "pluto inhabits a kozai resonance established by the total secular potential of all 4 giant planets , such that its @xmath43 librates about 90@xmath39 with an amplitude of @xmath44 ( for a review , see malhotra & williams 1997 ) .",
    "thus , pluto attains perihelion and is brightest only when it sits above the invariable plane by its orbital inclination of @xmath45 .",
    "if enough plutinos inhabit pluto - like kozai resonances , their detection would be influenced by selection effects that depend on the latitude of observation .",
    "how many plutinos and twotinos inhabit kozai - type resonances ?",
    "nesvorny , roig , & ferraz - mello ( 2000 ) find that few observed plutinos , @xmath024 out of 33 , exhibit libration of @xmath43 .",
    "they explore a scenario by which pluto gravitationally scatters other plutinos out of the kozai resonance .",
    "they find the scenario to be viable , though whether it is required by the model of resonant capture and migration is unknown ; the efficiency of capture into a pluto - like kozai resonance in malhotra s ( 1995 ) model of planetary migration might already be small enough to explain the observations .",
    "unlike the case for the 3:2 resonance , we are not aware of any study of the possibility of @xmath43-libration within the 2:1 resonance . in  [ secresres ] below ,",
    "we investigate by direct numerical simulation the capture probability into kozai - type resonances for both plutinos and twotinos within the model of planetary migration .",
    "here we describe our model for the radial migration of the four giant planets and the resonant capture of planetesimals .",
    "model ingredients are supplied in  [ ingred ] , mean - motion resonance capture efficiencies are computed in ",
    "[ capeff ] , mean - motion resonance libration statistics and retainment efficiencies are discussed in  [ libstat ] , and the statistics of secular resonance capture are presented in  [ secresres ] . those readers interested in the spatial distribution of resonant objects may skip to  [ snap ] without much loss of continuity .      to effect the migration ,",
    "we follow malhotra ( 1995 ) and introduce a perturbative acceleration on each planet of the form    @xmath46    where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the initial and final semi - major axes of a given planet , respectively , @xmath49 is the gravitational constant , @xmath50 measures time , @xmath51 is a time constant , and @xmath52 is the unit vector pointing in the instantaneous direction of the planet s velocity .",
    "equation ( [ migacc ] ) corrects a typographical sign error in equation ( 7 ) of malhotra ( 1995 ) .",
    "this prescription causes each planet s semi - major axis to evolve according to    @xmath53    but does not directly induce long - term changes in the planet s eccentricity and inclination .",
    "we adopt values for @xmath54 for each of the planets as follows ( in aus ) : jupiter @xmath55 , saturn @xmath56 , uranus @xmath57 , and neptune @xmath58 .",
    "we work in a coordinate system that takes the reference plane to be the invariable plane of the solar system . the positions and velocities of each planet at @xmath59 are adapted from cohen , hubbard , and oesterwinter ( 1973 ) , with the positions multiplied by @xmath60 and the velocities multiplied by @xmath61 .",
    "we employ the symplectic integrator , symba , developed by duncan , levison , & lee ( 1998 ) , which is based on the algorithm by wisdom & holman ( 1991 ) .",
    "the integrator was kindly supplied to us by e. thommes , m. duncan , & h. levison .    for simulations ia and ib that are described in  [ migmod ] , we take @xmath62 .",
    "shorter migration periods of @xmath63 and @xmath64 are considered in  [ vary ] .    in simulation ia , we focus on the efficiency of capture into , and the resultant dynamics within , the 3:2 resonance .",
    "we introduce 400 massless test particles whose initial semi - major axes lie between 31.4 au ( @xmath65 greater than the initial location of the 3:2 resonance ) and 38.5 au ( @xmath65 short of the final location of the 3:2 resonance ) .",
    "all particles in this region have the potential to be captured into the sweeping 3:2 resonance .",
    "their initial eccentricities and inclinations are randomly drawn from uniform distributions between 0 and 0.05 , and between @xmath32 and @xmath66 , respectively .",
    "arguments of periastron ( @xmath43 ) , longitudes of ascending nodes ( @xmath67 ) , and mean anomalies ( @xmath68 ) are uniformly sampled between 0 and @xmath69 .",
    "the duration of the integration spans @xmath70 .    in simulation ib",
    ", we concentrate on the 2:1 resonance . the only essential difference between simulations",
    "ia and ib is that for the latter , the 400 test particles are distributed initially between 37.7 au ( @xmath65 greater than the initial location of the 2:1 resonance ) and 46.8 au ( @xmath65 less than the final location of the 2:1 resonance ) .",
    "thus , all such particles are potentially captured into the 2:1 resonance .",

    "92 are captured into the 3:2 resonance . by definition",
    ", @xmath24 librates for these 92 objects but circulates for the remaining 308 .",
    "this capture efficiency of @xmath72 reflects ( 1 ) the probability of capture into the isolated 3:2 resonant potential just prior to resonance encounter ( henrard & lemaitre 1983 , borderies & goldreich 1984 ) , ( 2 ) losses due to pre - emptive capture into `` competing '' resonances such as the 5:3 and 2:1 which lie exterior to the 3:2 , and ( 3 ) losses due to violent scattering by close encounters with the planets .",
    "figure [ ea32 ] displays the final eccentricities and inclinations versus the semi - major axes of those test particles having @xmath73 .    from simulation ib",
    ", we estimate the capture efficiency of the 2:1 resonance to be @xmath74% . this value is more than twice as high as @xmath75 , reflecting both the lack of competition from other sweeping resonances which lie interior to the 2:1 , and the lower probability of scattering by neptune at these greater distances .",
    "figure [ ea21 ] displays the final ( @xmath7,@xmath76,@xmath77 ) for those test particles having @xmath78 at the close of simulation ib .",
    "note that many objects remain uncaptured by any low - order resonance at semi - major axes @xmath79 ; these non - resonant bodies presumably represent members of the low - inclination classical kuiper belt that is observed today ( levison & stern 2001 ; brown 2001 ) .",
    "these capture efficiencies are recorded in table [ capefftab ] .",
    "we emphasize that @xmath80 represents only the efficiency of capture , as distinct from the efficiency of retainment of captured objects , @xmath81 , over the age of the solar system .",
    "whether a captured kbo remains in a given resonance over @xmath82 is discussed in  [ libstat ] .",
    "mean inclinations , @xmath83 , of plutinos and twotinos are plotted against mean eccentricities , @xmath84 , in figure [ ei ] .",
    "the mean is taken over the last @xmath85 in simulation ia , and the last @xmath86 in ib , during which times the migration has effectively stopped .",
    "there is a tendency for the plutinos to have their @xmath83 s and @xmath84 s inversely correlated .",
    "no apparent correlation exists between @xmath83 and @xmath84 for the twotinos .",
    "the predicted inclinations seem too low to compare favorably with the observed inclinations ; the inadequacy of the migration model in explaining the inclination distribution of plutinos has been noted by brown ( 2001 ) .",
    "we note further that 4 out of the 5 observed twotino candidates have orbital inclinations between @xmath87 and @xmath88values characteristically larger than what the migration model predicts for objects in the 2:1 resonance .      for the plutinos in simulation ia , we find that @xmath89 , as expected from resonant perturbation theory for low eccentricity orbits .",
    "the distribution of libration amplitudes , @xmath90/2 $ ] , is supplied in figure [ histo32allin1 ] .",
    "most objects have substantial libration amplitudes @xmath91 .",
    "levison & stern ( 1995 ) and morbidelli ( 1997 ) calculate that plutinos having large @xmath92 can escape the 3:2 resonance over the age of the solar system .",
    "thus , many of the plutinos that are captured in our simulation ia would not likely survive if we were to extend our integration to @xmath93 .",
    "we define the retainment efficiency , @xmath94 , to be the fraction of captured plutinos that either have @xmath95 or that exhibit libration of @xmath43 about @xmath3 .",
    "these selection criteria are motivated by the stability study of levison & duncan ( 1995 ; see their figure 7 ) .",
    "of the 92 captured plutinos in simulation ia , 42 satisfy our criteria for long - term residency ; the resultant value for @xmath96% is recorded in table [ capefftab ] .    for the twotinos in simulation ib , @xmath97 groups",
    "about 3 values : @xmath0@xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath0@xmath100 .",
    "the splitting of libration centers at large @xmath76 from a single center at @xmath99 to two additional centers at @xmath0@xmath98 and @xmath0@xmath100 was explored by morbidelli , thomas , & moons ( 1995 ) , malhotra ( 1996 ) , and references therein .",
    "figure [ lib21 ] plots @xmath101 against @xmath97 .",
    "objects that reside more deeply in the resonance librate about @xmath102 and @xmath98 .",
    "the former center is more heavily populated than the latter at the level of 93 to 85 objects .",
    "though this difference is formally statistically insignificant , we nonetheless believe that it reflects a heretofore unnoticed and physically significant signature of the migration model .",
    "further evidence supporting our contention is provided in ",
    "[ vary ] , where we demonstrate that faster migration speeds dramatically enhance the asymmetry to levels of statistical significance .",
    "unlike for the case of the 3:2 resonance , long - term , systematic studies of the stability of objects within the 2:1 resonance have not been published .",
    "it might be thought that the requirements for stability within the 2:1 resonance are less stringent than for the 3:2 resonance , because the @xmath103 and @xmath104 secular resonances do not overlap the 2:1 ( morbidelli",
    "et al .  1995 ) .",
    "simulations by malhotra ( 2002 , personal communication ) indicate that the retainment efficiency is roughly @xmath105 , and we will adopt this value in this paper .",
    "many of the objects having @xmath106/2 \\approx \\pi$ ] also librate from time to time about @xmath0@xmath98 and @xmath0@xmath100 .",
    "an example of such a `` three - timing '' twotino is displayed in figure [ threetimer ] .",

    "for completeness , @xmath84 , @xmath83 , @xmath107 , and @xmath108 are plotted against one another in figures [ ephi ] and [ iphi ] .",
    "one correlation that emerges is that between @xmath84 and @xmath97 for @xmath109 , @xmath100 . increasing @xmath84 increases the separation of the two principal libration centers away from @xmath110 , an effect seen previously by malhotra ( 1996 ) .",
    "another correlation appears between @xmath26 and @xmath83 .",
    "large amplitude librators tend to have large @xmath83 .",
    "of the 92 captured plutinos in simulation ia , 917 evince libration of @xmath43 over the last @xmath85 of the simulation .",
    "our uncertainty arises because for 8 plutinos , the duration of the simulation is too short to see either a complete cycle of libration or of circulation .",
    "the libration centers , @xmath111 , are distributed over @xmath090@xmath39 , @xmath0@xmath23 , and @xmath0@xmath112 for the 9 confirmed @xmath43-librators .",
    "a sampling of the time evolution of @xmath43 for three @xmath43-librators in the 3:2 resonance is provided in figure [ w32 ] .",
    "only a subset of the 92 captured plutinos are likely to remain bound to the 3:2 resonance over @xmath82 . of the 92",
    ", we estimate that 42 are potential long - term residents : they either have @xmath113 or their @xmath43 s librate with small amplitude about @xmath3 [ compare with levison & stern ( 1995 ) ] . of these 42 , 812 are @xmath43-librators , or 2030% .",
    "since the @xmath43-librators comprise a minority among surviving 3:2 resonant objects , and since @xmath111 can equal @xmath23 in addition to @xmath3 , we conclude that secular libration of @xmath43 resulting from the migration model probably does not introduce strong latitudinal selection effects for the discovery of plutinos .",
    "of course , a zeroth - order assessment of latitudinal selection effects for resonant objects probably requires that we move beyond , or in the extreme case abandon , the model for resonant migration , since it apparently can not reproduce very well the observed inclination distributions ; see  [ capeff ] and brown ( 2001 ) .",
    "similar conclusions are obtained for twotinos .",
    "of the 212 objects captured into the 2:1 resonance , only 1215 evince libration of @xmath43 .",
    "figure [ w21 ] samples three of them .",
    "our results address a question posed by nesvorny , roig , & ferraz - mello ( 2000 ; see their footnote 3 ) .",
    "could the observed paucity of plutinos in the kozai resonance today be a primordial relic of resonant capture and migration ?",

    "this fraction of @xmath04/42 compares well with the observed fraction of @xmath03/33 reported by nesvorny et al .",
    "thus , our answer to their question is yes ",
    "scattering effects by pluto need not be invoked to explain today s observed low fraction of plutinos in the kozai resonance .",
    "we leave unaddressed two issues : ( 1 ) the effects of collisions amongst kbos in the primordial belt in populating the kozai resonance , and ( 2 ) whether the fact that the most massive plutino yet discovered also inhabits the kozai resonance is coincidental .",

    "thus , if we assume that @xmath187 , and take the dotted curve for @xmath188 in figure [ dobjperdeg ] as our guide , then we crudely estimate the bias in finding plutinos over twotinos , averaged over all longitudes for which plutinos have been discovered ( @xmath189@xmath190 , and @xmath191@xmath112 ) , to be @xmath192",
    ". then the observed ratio , @xmath12 , should be de - biassed down to values closer to @xmath193 .",
    "we emphasize that this is a model - dependent estimate of @xmath179 that assumes that @xmath158 .",
    "since @xmath194 , we would estimate the ratio of primeval populations to be @xmath195 .",
    "this would reflect a steep drop in mass density over a short distance in the ancient planetesimal disk .",
    "nonetheless , it would be consonant with the idea that a `` kuiper cliff '' ( chiang & brown 1999 ; see also allen , bernstein , & malhotra 2001 ; jewitt , luu , & trujillo 1998 ; gladman et al .",
    "1998 ) delineates the edge of the classical kuiper belt at @xmath196 .",
    "if we assume instead that @xmath150 and repeat the same analysis by using the dotted line for @xmath197 in figure [ dobjperdegii ] , we estimate an intrinsic @xmath198 , and a corresponding ratio of primeval populations of @xmath199 .",
    "thus , while our estimate that plutinos intrinsically outnumber twotinos by a factor of @xmath03-to-1 seems robust to changes in @xmath51 , a dramatic drop in mass density with distance in the primordial planetesimal disk is by no means an assured conclusion .",
    "the above estimates for @xmath179 are plagued by other observational biases that are difficult to quantify .",
    "for example , the minor planet center dataset probably contains more plutinos relative to twotinos than it should because ( 1 ) mpc orbit fitting algorithms for objects discovered a few au inside neptune s orbit and having short astrometric arcs favor plutino - like orbits as trial solutions ( b.  marsden 2002 , personal communication ) , and ( 2 ) the astrometric recovery rate of plutinos is probably higher than that of twotinos because the former objects are , on average , closer and therefore easier to re - detect by virtue of their brightness and large apparent proper motion .",
    "both these factors lead us to conclude that our above estimates for @xmath179 should be considered upper limits .",
    "superior estimates for @xmath179 can be obtained by coupling our theoretical calculations to the results of surveys having well - documented discovery statistics and minimal bias in their algorithms for orbit fitting . the deep ecliptic survey ( des ; millis et al .",
    "2002 ) , for example , promises to be one such survey ; it employs the more objective method of bernstein & khushalani ( 2000 ) in fitting orbits with short arcs .",
    "we defer analysis of the resonant populations using their large and homogeneous dataset to future study .",
    "an early but intriguing comparison between theory and observation lies in the complete absence of observed twotino candidates at longitudes behind that of neptune ( see figures [ snap21 ] and [ snap21longiib ] ) . by contrast , our numerical experiments demonstrate that resonant capture and migration preferentially fill the 2:1 resonant lobe displaced behind of , rather than ahead of , neptune s longitude .",
    "moreover , this asymmetry is only enhanced by faster rates of migration ( figure [ snap21longiib ] ) . with only @xmath05 candidate twotinos ,",
    "the probability of finding all of them in the forward lobe and not the backward lobe is 1/32 , under the prior that a twotino is as likely to be found in one lobe as the other .",
    "whether the actual kuiper belt defies the predicted sign of the asymmetry  in which case the present theory of resonant capture and migration must be considered either incomplete or incorrect  only continuing surveys for kbos will tell .",
    "we have analyzed quantitatively the predictions of the model of resonant capture and migration for the 2:1 ( twotino ) and 3:2 ( plutino ) populations of the kuiper belt .",
    "we summarize our main findings as follows :    1 .",
    "the instantaneous spatial distribution of resonant objects depends not only on the libration centers of their resonant arguments , @xmath31 , but also on their distribution of libration amplitudes , @xmath92 .",
    "for example , if @xmath200 for most plutinos , the usual expectation that such objects are most readily found @xmath3 away from neptune s longitude would not be valid .",
    "the distribution of libration amplitudes within a given resonance is model - dependent .",
    "we have numerically evaluated the capture efficiencies , @xmath80 , of the sweeping 2:1 and 3:2 resonances for three values of the migration timescale , @xmath201 and @xmath177 .",
    "the timescale is assumed to be one of exponential decay .",
    "we define the capture efficiency to equal the fraction of objects whose orbits are initially spread uniformly over the complete path of a given sweeping resonance and that are ultimately captured by it .",
    "this efficiency depends not only on the probability of capture into the isolated resonant potential of interest , but also on the probability of pre - emptive capture into other resonances that lie exterior to the given resonance , and on the probability of violent scattering by close encounters with the planets .",
    "the capture efficiency for twotinos , @xmath202 , decays from 53% to 0% as @xmath51 is reduced from @xmath164 to @xmath178 .",
    "the capture efficiency for plutinos , @xmath75 , increases from 23% to 78% as @xmath51 decreases from @xmath164 to @xmath165 ; the shorter migration timescale breeds fewer close encounters and fewer objects are lost to the competing 2:1 resonance . for @xmath152 , @xmath163 .",
    "3 .   at least 1 twotino candidate having a large eccentricity has been observed .",
    "this observation , interpreted within the confines of our migration model , implies that @xmath51 can not be equal to or lower than @xmath178 .",
    "this conclusion is subject to the caveat that the migration model does not fully account for the observations ; e.g. , the model fails to generate the large orbital inclinations that are observed throughout the kuiper belt .",
    "we have simulated the instantaneous spatial distributions of twotinos and plutinos as predicted by the migration model .",
    "if @xmath187 , twotinos cluster at longitudes displaced @xmath2 away from neptune s longitude , where the upper sign corresponds to those objects librating with low amplitudes , @xmath203 , about @xmath204 , and the lower sign corresponds to objects librating with similarly low amplitudes about @xmath102 .",
    "plutinos cluster at longitudes displaced @xmath3 away from neptune s longitude , and all librate about @xmath89 . longitude - to - longitude variations in the sky densities of plutinos and twotinos persist even for surveys that are not volume - limited in their ability to detect resonant objects of a given size .",
    "these variations sharpen as the limiting distance out to which resonant objects can be detected decreases .",
    "5 .   over the longitude interval @xmath144@xmath145 ( @xmath4 to @xmath5 of neptune s longitude )",
    ", the bias in finding plutinos over twotinos is minimized .",
    "if the population of one resonance is identical to the other in terms of number , sizes , albedos , and orbital inclinations , then the migration model for @xmath158 predicts 0.4 to 1 times as many twotinos to be found over this longitude interval than plutinos , as the limiting distance out to which objects are detected increases from 40 au to @xmath146 . if @xmath156 , the bias over this special longitude range varies from 0.4 to 1.1 . a similar interval exists between @xmath32 and @xmath147 ( + @xmath205@xmath36 of neptune s longitude ) if @xmath187 , but does not exist if @xmath156 ( see next point ) .",

    "more objects are captured into libration about @xmath206 than about @xmath109 .",
    "the difference betwen populations is @xmath010% if @xmath187 , and increases to @xmath0330% if @xmath156 .",
    "we reserve an analytic explanation for our numerical discovery to future study .",
    "the asymmetry in libration centers translates directly into an asymmetry in the instantaneous spatial distribution of twotinos  more twotinos are expected to be found at longitudes behind that of neptune than in front of it .",
    "a differential measurement of the twotino density ahead and behind of neptune would powerfully constrain the migration history of that planet . 7 .   measuring the relative populations of plutinos to twotinos",
    "is a model - dependent enterprise . under the assumption that twotinos and plutinos share the same sizes , albedos , and orbital inclinations , we employ the results in this paper to crudely de - bias the current tally of @xmath043 observed plutinos to @xmath05 observed twotinos to estimate an intrinsic population ratio of @xmath2073.6 .",
    "the range in our estimate reflects an order - of - magnitude difference in the assumed @xmath51 , from @xmath164 to @xmath165 .",
    "we suspect that our estimate is an upper limit because plutinos probably enjoy a greater frequency of astrometric recovery than twotinos , and because orbit fitting algorithms employed by the minor planet center , whose dataset we use , favor plutino - like trajectories . improved estimates for @xmath179 can be obtained by coupling our calculation to kbo surveys having well - documented discovery statistics . while it tentatively appears that plutinos might intrinsically outnumber twotinos by a factor not exceeding @xmath03 , this conclusion can but does not necessarily imply that the surface density of the primordial planetesimal disk dropped dramatically with distance in the vicinity of @xmath042 au .",
