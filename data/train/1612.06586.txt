    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are among the most powerful explosion events in the universe since the big bang ( e.g. kumar & zhang ( 2015 ) for a recent review ) .",
    "the very high luminosity is generally believed to be produced in a relativistic jet with a large initial bulk lorentz factor ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "however , it is unclear how such a jet is launched from the grb central engine .",
    "two types of grb central engine models have been discussed in the literature : the hyper - accreting black hole ( bh ) models ( e.g. , popham et al .",

    "; lei et al . 2013 ) , and the millisecond magnetar models ( e.g. usov 1992 ; thompson 1994 ; dai & lu 1998a , b ; wheeler et al . 2000 ; zhang & meszaros 2001 ; metzger et al . 2008 , 2011 ; bucciantini et al . 2012 ) .",
    "recently , l & zhang ( 2014 ) systematically analyzed the swift / xrt lightcurves of long grbs , and found that both types of central engines may be operating in grbs .",
    "while some of them may habor a millisecond magnetar central engine , the majority of grbs likely have a hyper - accreting black hole central engine .    within the black hole central engine scenario , there are two main energy reservoirs to provide the jet power : the accretion energy in the disk that is mostly carried by neutrinos and anti - neutrinos , which annihilate and power a bipolar outflow ( popham et al . 1999 ; di matteo et al .",
    "2002 ) ; and the spin energy of the bh , which can be tapped by a magnetic field connecting the outer world through the blandford & znajek ( 1977 , hereafter bz ) mechanism .",
    "it is unclear which one is the main mechanism to launch the jet .",
    "the luminosity and the initial lorentz factor @xmath0 of the jet are two important parameters , that carry the information about jet launching . using the peak time of the early optical afterglow onset bump as the deceleration time of the grb ejecta , liang et al .",
    "( 2010 ) found a correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath2 .",
    "the correlation is confirmed by later analyses ( e.g. ghirlanda et al .",
    "2012 ; l et al . 2012 ; liang et al .",
    "( 2012 ) also discovered a somewhat tighter correlation between @xmath0 and the isotropic mean @xmath4-ray luminosity ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "lei et al . ( 2013 ) investigated the baryon loading processses in the hyper - accreting black hole central engine models for the two jet launching mechanisms : the non - magnetized @xmath7 - annihilation mechanism and the strongly magnetized bz mechanism .",
    "the two models have distinct predictions between @xmath0 and the total jet power .",
    "both of them predict a positive correlation between @xmath0 and the power .",
    "the predicted slopes seem to be consistent with the ones found by liang et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and l et al .",
    "however , there are two missing links between the model predictions and the observed correlations : first , the central engine models directly predict the total jet power , whereas the previous studies only deal with the observed @xmath4-ray power . in order to get the total power , one needs to conduct an study of the afterglow to retrieve the kinetic energy power .",
    "second , the model predictions are relevant to the beaming corrected total power , rather than the isotropic equivalent values presented in the prevous studies . as a result , in order to confront the observational data with the central engine models , one needs to collect a sample of grbs whose @xmath0 can be measured , and whose @xmath4-ray radiation efficiency @xmath9 and jet opening angle @xmath1 can be constrained from the data .    in this paper , we work on a grb sample whose @xmath0 values are measured using the peak of the early optical afterglow light curve assuming that the peak time @xmath10 corresponds to the blastwave deceleration time , and whose jet opening - angle @xmath1 are calculated from the jet break time @xmath11 in afterglow light curves .",
    "the kinetic energy @xmath12 of each grb can be obtained by using the x - ray afterglow data during the normal decay phase .",
    "our goal is to compare the data with the black hole central engine model predictions . in order to test our predictions , we also selected some bursts graded as `` gold '' magnetar candidates by l & zhang 2014 ( see also lyons et al .",
    "2010 and rowlinson et al .",
    "2014 ) in our sample .",
    "we then study the correlations between @xmath0 and the beaming corrected energies ( @xmath13 ) or mean luminosities ( @xmath14 ) , and compare the results with the predictions from the @xmath7 - annihilation and the bz jet launching mechanisms , respectively .",
    "the data analysis results are presented in section 2 , and the theoretical implications are discussed in section 3 .",
    "the results are summarized in section 4 .",
    "we extensively search for the grbs whose both initial lorentz factor and jet opening angle can be constrained .",
    "the initial lorentz factor @xmath0 is obtained by the afterglow onset method , which uses the peak of the early afterglow light curve to determine the deceleration time of blast wave . for a constant density medium case ,",
    "@xmath0 is given by ( l et al .",
    "2012 ; liang et al .",
    "2013 ) , @xmath15^{1/8 } ,     \\label{eq : dec}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the medium number density , @xmath17 is the redshift , @xmath18 is the proton mass , @xmath19 is the efficiency of grbs , @xmath10 is peak time of the afterglow bump , and the numerical factor 1.4 is derived from a more precise integration of blastwave dynamics before the deceleration time .",
    "there are other methods for constraining @xmath0 , such as the pair opacity constraint method ( e.g. lithwick & sari 2001 ) and early external forward emission method ( e.g. zou & piran 2010 ) , which can usually only give a lower ( or upper ) limit to the lorentz factor ( l et al .",
    "therefore we generally focus on a sample of grbs with @xmath10 observed .",
    "liang et al . ( 2010 ) worked on an optical afterglow onset sample and constrained @xmath0 for about 20 grbs . in this paper , we worked on an expanded optical sample and also constrained @xmath0 with the same method .",
    "most of the optical sample are taken from liang et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , and our entire sample includes 36 grbs as presented in table 1 .    in order to identify jet breaks , one needs to systematically explore temporal breaks in the afterglow lightcurves .",
    "theoretically there are several types of temporal breaks ( e.g. zhang 2007 ) , but observationally the observed breaks generally fall into two types .",
    "the first type connects a shallow decay ( decay index shallower than -1 ) segment to a normal decay ( decay slope @xmath20 ) segment ( zhang et al .",
    "this break is best interpreted as the cessation of energy injection into to the blastwave ( dai & lu 1998a , b ; rees & mszros 1998 ; zhang & mszros 2001 ; liang et al .",
    "2007 ) , probably from a spinning - down millisecond magnetar ( troja et al . 2007 ; lyons et al . 2010 ; rowlinson et al . 2013 ; l & zhang 2014 ; gompertz et al .",
    "2014 ; l et al .",
    "the second type is a transition from the normal decay phase ( decay slope @xmath20 ) to a steeper phase ( decay slope @xmath21 ) , which is best interpreted as a jet break ( rhoads 1999 ; sari et al .",
    "1999 ; frail et al . 2001 ; wu et al . 2004 ; liang et al .",
    "2008 ; racusin et al .",
    "differentiation of the two types of breaks is usually straightforward , but sometimes can be more complicated ( see wang et al .",
    "2015 for a recent detailed treatment ) .",
    "in our work , we identify jet breaks from afterglow light curves that show a transition from the normal decay phase ( decay slope @xmath20 ) to a steeper phase ( decay slope @xmath21 ) .",
    "we identified 17 jet breaks in our @xmath0 sample , most of the values of @xmath22 are calculated from x - ray afterglow light curves , which are obtained from the uk swift / xrt website ( evans et al .",
    "2007 , 2009 ) .",
    "the relevant information ( frequency band , @xmath23 , and references ) is collected in table 2 . for these grbs",
    ", we derive the jet opening angles using ( e.g. frail et al .",
    "2001 ; wu et al . 2004 ; yi et al . 2015 ) @xmath24    for those grbs without a jet break feature , we take the last observational point of the normal phase as a lower limit of the jet break time , and derive a lower limit of the half opening angle @xmath1 . we note that both eq.([eq : dec ] ) and ( [ eq : theta_j ] ) are derived assuming a constant density medium .",
    "long grbs originate from the collapse of the massive stars , the circumburst medium of long grbs may be a wind type .",
    "however , according to schulze et al . ( 2011 ) , they considered a group of grbs with the lightcurve and sed analysis , the majority of cases consistent an ism type medium .",
    "therefore , we simply assume an ism case in this paper , having in mind that this is only a rough approximation of real conditions .",
    "with the half opening angle derived , we can perform beaming correction for energy and luminosity from isotropic values , i.e. @xmath25 where @xmath26    table 1 show the basic parameters of the grbs in our sample , including name , redshift , @xmath27 , and all the isotropic values ( e.g. @xmath4-ray energy @xmath28 and average @xmath4-ray luminosity during the prompt emission phase @xmath29 ) .",
    "the derived parameters such as @xmath0 and @xmath1 are presented in table 2 , along with beaming corrected values of energies and luminosities ( e.g. @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) .",
    "we plot @xmath0 versus @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( blue and red data points ) in the top and bottom panels of fig.1 , respectively .",
    "the blue dots are the grbs with @xmath1 measurements , while red triangles have lower limits of @xmath1 . for comparison",
    ", we also plot @xmath0 versus @xmath28 and @xmath8 ( black dots ) .",
    "we confirm the correlations of @xmath0-@xmath28 and @xmath0-@xmath8 .",
    "the best linear fitting results are @xmath32 with a pearson correlation coefficient @xmath33 and chance probability @xmath34 , and @xmath35 with @xmath36 ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "these results are consistent with the results of liang et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and l et al .",
    "( 2012 ) .",
    "we next evaluate possible correlation between @xmath0 and beaming corrected energy / luminosity . discarding the lower limits , the 17 grbs with precise beaming corrections give rise to the correlations @xmath37 with @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) , and @xmath40 with @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "these correlations are less tight compared with the correlations with the isotropic values .",
    "it is generally accepted that grb emission originates from two distinct locations . the prompt emission",
    "is believed to be generated from an `` internal '' location before the ejecta is decelerated by the ambient medium .",
    "the process dissipates the kinetic energy of the outflow through internal shocks ( e.g. rees & mszros 1994 ; piran 1999 ) or dissipate magnetic energy in a poynting flux dominated outflow ( e.g. zhang & yan 2011 ) . after the dissipation , the bulk of the energy is contained in the kinetic form of the ejecta , which drives a relativistic shock into the medium to power the afterglow ( mszros & rees 1997 ; sari et al .",
    "1998 ; wu et al . 2005",
    "; yi et al . 2013 , 2014 , see gao et al .",
    "2013 for a recent review ) .",
    "therefore the total energy of the relativistic outflow is a sum of two components , the released @xmath4-ray energy ( @xmath30 ) during the prompt emission phase , and the kinetic energy ( @xmath43 ) of blastwave during the afterglow phase .",
    "the grb radiation efficiency is defined as ( lloyd - ronning & zhang 2004 ) , @xmath44 the isotropic kinetic energy @xmath45 can be measured from the x - ray afterglow flux during the normal decay phase .",

    "we confirmed several previously discovered correlations ( liang et al .",
    "2010 ; l et al .",

    "are directly related to the grb central engine , we can use the data to constrain the jet launching mechanism in the bh central engine model .    comparing the observational results with the theoretical predictions from the two types of bh central engine models , i.e.,the @xmath7 - annihilation mechanism ( non - magnetized model ) and the bz mechanism ( strongly magnetized model )",
    ", we found that the required parameters are contrived for the former mechanism , whereas the latter ( bz ) mechanism can generally account for the observations .",
    "we tentatively suggest the grb jet composition contains a significant fraction of poynting flux , and the grb prompt emission is likely powered by dissipation of magnetic field energy ( which also seen zhang & yan 2011 ; yi et al .",
    "2016 ) .",
    "two caveats need to be mentioned .",
    "first , the @xmath80 and @xmath81 correlations are very rough , with a lower correlation coefficient than the @xmath166 and @xmath167 relations . there are large uncertainties involved when constraining @xmath43 and @xmath66 , due to the uncertainties in the values of the shock equipartition parameters . on the other hand ,",
    "the wide scatter is not in conflict with the theoretical models , which predicts a wide range of @xmath0 and @xmath67 due to their dependences on many model parameters ( e.g. @xmath168 , @xmath116 , @xmath92 , @xmath105 , @xmath1 ) . in any case , the available data allow us to reach the conclusion that the data are more consistent with the bz mechanism than the non - magnetized @xmath126-annihilation mechanism .",
    "second , we focus on the bh central engine model .",
    "another frequently discussed central engine model is the millisecond magnetar central engine model ( e.g. metzger et al . 2011 ) .",
    "we justify this approach by excluding the gold - sample magnetar candidates as identified by ( l & zhang 2014 ) .",
