    "the statistical analysis of a system is essential when fluctuations contribute to its dynamics @xcite . in different areas , beyond the importance of the statistical description of the system state and its evolution ,",
    "the main variable of interest is the time at which this state reaches a certain region for the first time @xcite , constituting the so - called first - passage - time ( fpt ) problem .",
    "for example , in a diffusion - controlled reaction a particle performs a random walk until it makes contact with a reactant or a trap giving rise to the reaction @xcite . generally , in a fpt problem",
    ", the system is able to evolve according to a given dynamics in a confined region , limited by one or more absorbing boundaries . even for simple autonomous systems",
    ", the fpt problem can be analytically difficult to solve .",
    "for example , for the ornstein - uhlenbeck process with a fixed positive absorbing boundary , the fpt solution ( representing the fpt density function ) is relatively easy to be found in the laplace domain , but its inverse transform is not explicitly available @xcite .",
    "a notable exception is the fpt problem for a brownian motion ( wiener process ) , where different methods are easy to be applied to solve it @xcite .",
    "a greater complexity is found when a time - inhomogeneous process defines the system dynamics . in this case , analytical methods are _ formally _ given within different approaches @xcite , but exact as well as approximate explicit results are scarce in the literature and probably difficult to obtain . among the different ways to introduce a time inhomogeneity into the system ( for example , temporally varying absorbing boundaries @xcite , time - dependent drift and diffusion coefficients @xcite , etc ) , we focus on a particular drift coefficient evolving externally in time .",
    "the process analysed here is driven by an exponential time - dependent drift ( this case , in turn , can be mapped into a variable threshold @xcite ) , which naturally arises in neuroscience when modelling adapting neurons @xcite . in this context ,",
    "the membrane potential ( state variable ) of a perfect integrate - and - fire neuron model is driven during its subthreshold evolution by an external current , composed of a constant deterministic current plus fast fluctuations @xcite , as well as an intrinsic temporally decaying current @xcite .",
    "this system corresponds exactly to the case analysed here , and the fpt represents the production of a spike .",
    "+ the interest in the fpt problem for a brownian particle in a time - inhomogeneous setup started in the 1990s , when different systems driven by periodically modulated drifts were studied within the context of the stochastic resonance phenomenon @xcite .",
    "in particular , bulsara _ et al _ applied the method of images to a wiener process driven by a sinusoidal temporal drift in the presence of an absorbing boundary @xcite , a procedure of limited validity @xcite . later , other threshold processes under analogous conditions were theoretically analysed with different approximation methods @xcite .",
    "even when appealing , single sinusoidal temporal drifts do not represent a general case . for arbitrary time - dependent drifts ,",
    "the simplest procedures are a quasiadiabatic reduction @xcite , a quasistatic description @xcite , or small amplitude approximations .",
    "however , for rapidly varying arbitrary fields , the time - dependent structure of the problem can not be simplified .",
    "up to our knowledge , the first attempt to include an arbitrary temporal drift ( without spatial dependence ) in a general framework was made in @xcite , where the author proposed a method to describe the first - order correction to the moments of the fpt density , in a perturbation scheme .",
    "+ the preceding studies describe _ approximately _ the fpt problem of a given continuous stochastic process in a restricted domain for particular or general temporal drifts . in general , explicit _ exact _ results for time - inhomogeneous systems are infrequent . notably and as an exception ,",
    "in @xcite the authors derive the fpt density function of a wiener process , in the presence of an absorbing boundary , where both the drift and the diffusion coefficients are varying temporally and in proportion to each other .",
    "in particular , when proportionality is satisfied , the fokker - planck equation ruling the evolution of the transition probability between the states at two times can be time - rescaled in order to resemble the simpler constant coefficients case , where the exact solution is known .",
    "however , the restriction in the coefficients proportionality limits its applicability to our case . for the fpt problem",
    "we are interested in , we have previously proposed a series solution in terms of the intensity of the time - dependent drift @xcite ( see also @xcite for analogous series solutions , but focusing on the perturbation regime ) .",
    "however , in that work only the first terms in the expansion were explicitly given and higher order terms were just outlined .",
    "+ in this work , based on the structure of the equations obtained in @xcite for the survival probability , we explicitly obtain all order functions .",
    "in particular , we find the @xmath0th - term in a recursive scheme and prove by induction the complete mathematical solution . from the survival probability , it is straightforward to derive the fpt statistics , which maintains the series structure .",
    "since obtaining all order functions ( existence ) does not imply the convergence of the series , in the second part of the work , we analyse how does the expansion behave in comparison with results obtained from simulations , as we truncate the series at a finite order .",
