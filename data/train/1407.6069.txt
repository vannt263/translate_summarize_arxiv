    "magnetic reconnection is a fundamental process in astrophysical , space , and laboratory plasmas , which can change the topology of magnetic field lines , release magnetic energy , and accelerate electrons and ions @xcite .",
    "it is generally believed that magnetic reconnection is the underlying mechanism that powers explosive events such as solar flares , coronal mass ejections , geomagnetic substorms , and sawtooth crashes in fusion devices .",
    "much of the literature on magnetic reconnection focuses on two - dimensional ( 2d ) problems , i.e. when the whole reconnection process only depends on two spatial coordinates under a proper coordinate system , for reasons of analytic and numerical simplicity . at this time ,",
    "theories of 2d magnetic reconnection are highly developed and fairly well - understood .",
    "magnetic reconnection in 2d is known to take place at an x - point ( or x - line ) , where magnetic field line separatrices intersect ; across separatrices the field line mapping is discontinuous . as a magnetic field line is carried across a separatrix by plasma flow , the velocity field that preserves magnetic field line connectivity ( i.e. the velocity field carries a field line at one time to another field line at a later time ) diverges at the x - point @xcite ; that is , the field line is cut and rejoined with another field line at the x - point .",
    "real world magnetic reconnection of course takes place in three dimensions ( 3d ) .",
    "compared with 2d problems , magnetic reconnection in 3d is much less well - understood [ see , e.g. @xcite for a recent review , and the references therein . ]",
    "even the concept of magnetic reconnection can sometimes become ambiguous , especially in the absence of magnetic null points or closed magnetic field lines . in these situations ,",
    "all magnetic field lines are topologically equivalent , and a continuous velocity field that preserves magnetic field line connectivity can always be defined @xcite .",
    "where , then , does magnetic reconnection take place ?",
    "quasi - separatrix layers ( qsls ) , defined as regions where the field line mapping has large gradient @xcite , have been suggested as likely locations for reconnection to take place .",
    "although field line velocity can always be defined in a 3d magnetic field without null points or closed field lines , the field line velocity can differ significantly from the plasma velocity around qsls .",
    "the concept of qsls have been widely employed in analyzing 3d magnetic reconnection in recent numerical simulations and laboratory experiments @xcite .    in a magnetic field with no ignorable coordinates , magnetic field lines",
    "generically exponentiate apart from each other and become stochastic .",
    "such a generic condition usually occurs in space and astrophysical plasmas as well as in a number of contexts in laboratory plasmas ( including toroidal fusion plasmas ) in the presence of multiple tearing modes .",
    "also , global simulation codes for space weather studies often exhibit magnetic turbulence ( at fluid as well as kinetic levels ) which produces field - line exponentiation .",
    "that means that if we follow two field lines initially separated by an infinitesimal distance @xmath0 , in most cases the separation grows exponentially as @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the distance along the field line , and @xmath3 is an overall ( but in general not monotonically ) increasing function over distance .",
    "this fact is analogous to the well - known butterfly effect in the theory of deterministic dynamical systems as a sensitive dependence on initial conditions .",
    "@xcite has recently argued that under the condition of large field line exponentiation , an exponentially small non - ideal effect will completely scramble the field line mapping , and potentially lead to fast reconnection .",
    "although the notion of large field line exponentiation shares common ground with the concept of qsls , an important difference is that the condition for neighboring field line exponentiation is valid essentially for all field lines , therefore regions of large field line exponentiation do not necessarily concentrate in layers and can even be volume filling .",
    "the motivation of this study is to test this scenario proposed by boozer with numerical experiments as clean as possible . to this end",
    "we consider relaxation of force - free equilibria in a region bounded by two conducting plates under the effect of a finite but small resistivity . without resistivity , the field line mapping from one end to another is preserved . with a finite resistivity , the field line mapping evolves as time proceeds .",
    "we find that in general the field line connectivity changes rapidly in regions with large neighboring field line exponentiation .",
    "however , not all rapid changes of field line connectivity are associated with what is usually regarded as reconnection .",
    "we find two distinct phases of evolution  one is the quasi - static phase and the other the onset phase .",
    "the onset phase is triggered by some magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) instability .",
    "we find that change of field line connectivity during the quasi - static phase is more properly attributed to enhanced magnetic diffusion , whereas typical hallmarks of reconnection are found during the onset phase .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec :",
    "model - and - simulation ] we introduce the reduced magnetohydrodynamics ( rmhd ) model and simulation setup . in section [ sec : diagnostics ] , we introduce the details of diagnostics used to analyze the simulations .",
    "section [ sec : simulation - results ] presents two sets of simulations .",
    "the first set is governed by resistive quasi - static evolution , and the second set features the onset phase . section [ sec : discussion ] discusses important issues that arise from the simulation results , including the governing equations for resistive quasi - static evolution , the cause of the onset phase , and some measures to quantify the distinction between the two phases . finally , we summarize the key findings and conclude in section [ sec : summary - and - conclusion ] . in appendix",
    "[ sec : construction - of - force - free ] , we explain the procedure of constructing the initial rmhd force - free equilibrium in detail , and make comparison with the corresponding problem in full mhd .",
    "we employ the standard reduced magnetohydrodynamics ( rmhd ) model @xcite , which is valid in the presence of a strong uniform guide field , under the assumption that spatial length scales are much longer along the direction of the guide field than in directions perpendicular to the guide field .",
    "the governing equations can be written as :    @xmath4=\\partial_{z}j+[a , j]+\\nu\\nabla_{\\perp}^{2}\\omega-\\lambda\\omega,\\label{eq : rmhd - momentum}\\ ] ]    @xmath5=\\partial_{z}\\phi+\\eta\\nabla_{\\perp}^{2}a.\\label{eq : rmhd - faraday}\\ ] ]    here we assume the guide field to be along the @xmath6 direction , with the strength normalized to unity .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath7 and the plasma velocity @xmath8 are expressed in terms of the flux function @xmath9 and the stream function @xmath10 through the relations @xmath11 and @xmath12 ; and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are vorticity and electric current along the @xmath6 direction , respectively .",
    "the poisson bracket is defined as @xmath15=\\partial_{y}f\\partial_{x}g-\\partial_{x}f\\partial_{y}g$ ] .",
    "dissipations are introduced by including resistivity @xmath16 , viscosity @xmath17 , and a friction coefficient @xmath18 .",
    "we assume that the system is bounded in the @xmath6 direction by two conducting end plates at @xmath19 and @xmath20 , and is a @xmath21 box with doubly periodic boundary condition in the @xmath22 plane .",
    "rmhd models are often used in analytic and numerical studies of parker s coronal heating model @xcite . however , unlike simulations of parker s model , here we impose no boundary flow , i.e. the boundary conditions are @xmath23 at @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the governing equations are solved with a reduced version of the compressible mhd code debs @xcite .",
    "the @xmath22 plane is discretized with a pseudospectral method , and the @xmath6 direction is discretized with a finite difference method , where @xmath10 and @xmath9 reside on staggered grids .",
    "the timestepping is carried out with a semi - implicit , predictor - corrector leapfrog method , where @xmath10 and @xmath9 are staggered in time as well .    in this model",
    ", resistivity provides the mechanism that breaks the ideal constraint of frozen field lines , whereas viscosity and friction are introduced to damp alfvn waves that will be generated when the system is not in force equilibrium , e.g. due to reconnection .",
    "undamped alfvn waves bouncing back and forth between the two conducting end plates may lead to fine structures through distortion of wave packets and phase mixing , especially in regions where the magnetic field is highly sheared @xcite .",
    "although this phenomenon can be very important in wave dissipation and heating , it further complicates the problem and may lead to numerical difficulties . for these reasons ,",
    "we opt for damping out alfvn waves in order to to make the simulations as clean as possible .    a force - free equilibrium in rmhd satisfies the condition @xmath24=\\mathbf{b}\\cdot\\nabla j=0.$ ] formally , this equation is isomorphic to the 2d euler s equation of incompressible fluid , if we identify @xmath6 with a time variable , and @xmath9 with the stream function . therefore ,",
    "if @xmath9 is specified on a @xmath22 plane , we can construct the corresponding force - free equilibrium by integrating @xmath25 along @xmath6 ( see appendix [ sec : construction - of - force - free ] for details of numerical implementation ) . in our simulations , we construct the initial conditions by specifying the flux function at the mid - plane @xmath26 as a superposition of fourier harmonics @xmath27 where the coefficients @xmath28 are complex random numbers whose magnitudes @xmath29 on average scale as @xmath30 .",
    "only mode numbers @xmath31 , @xmath32 within the range @xmath33 are used .",
    "in addition , the coefficients @xmath28 must satisfy the reality condition @xmath34 . because euler s equation conserves energy , the equilibrium satisfies @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the magnetic field component on the @xmath22 plane .    in this study ,",
    "first a set of fourier coefficients @xmath28 are randomly chosen .",
    "subsequently , they are rescaled to a given @xmath37 , which is used as a free parameter to prescribe the initial equilibrium .",
    "we set the system length to a fixed value @xmath38 .",
    "this value of system length is arbitrary and does not affect the results , because the rmhd model is scale - invariant .",
    "that is , if @xmath39 and @xmath40 form a solution of rmhd with dissipation coefficients @xmath17 , @xmath16 , and @xmath18 , then for an arbitrary rescale factor @xmath41 , the rescaled solutions @xmath42 and @xmath43 satisfy rmhd with dissipation coefficients @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , a solution with respect to a given system length @xmath47 can always be rescaled to another solution with a system length @xmath48 .     profile , overlaid with contours of the flux function @xmath9 , on @xmath22 planes at @xmath19 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 , for the case @xmath51 .",

    "however , as we integrate @xmath25 along both @xmath53 directions , constant-@xmath52 contours become increasingly stretched and develop fine structures due to field line exponentiation .",
    "if the neighboring field lines exponentiate by a factor of @xmath54 , @xmath55 can be amplified by a factor up to @xmath54 . in the present case , although @xmath52 is of the order unity in the whole domain , @xmath55 clearly becomes large at @xmath19 and @xmath50 .",
    "once the initial equilibrium is constructed , we study resistive relaxation under different values of resistivity @xmath16 .",
    "we fix the viscosity @xmath56 and the friction coefficient @xmath57 . through numerical experiments ,",
    "we find that these values are sufficient to effectively damp out alfvn wave in a few alfvn transit times .",
    "neighboring field line exponentiation is characterized by the exponent @xmath58 , which can be calculated by simultaneously integrating the equation for field line    @xmath59    and the equation for infinitesimal separation @xmath60 between neighboring field lines : @xmath61 in terms of the flux function @xmath9 , equation ( [ eq : field_line ] ) can be written as @xmath62=\\left[\\begin{array}{c } \\partial_{y}a\\\\ -\\partial_{x}a \\end{array}\\right].\\label{eq : field_line_hamiltonian}\\ ] ] hence , the flux function @xmath9 is the hamiltonian for field lines , if we identify @xmath6 with a time variable . equation ( [ eq : separation ] ) can be written in matrix form as : @xmath63=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc } \\partial_{x}b_{x } & \\partial_{y}b_{x}\\\\ \\partial_{x}b_{y } & \\partial_{y}b_{y } \\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{c }",

    "the factor @xmath72 gives the maximum exponentiation we could have for two neighboring field lines .",
    "a geometrical interpretation of the exponent @xmath73 is that , if we follow a thin flux tube starting with a circular cross section of radius @xmath74 at @xmath19 , the cross section becomes an ellipse at @xmath75 , with @xmath76 and @xmath77 as the major and minor radii , respectively .",

    "however , note that neighboring field line exponentiation is a more general concept , in the sense that the squashing factor @xmath78 depends only on the field line mapping from one end plate to another , but not on the field line separation that occurs in the region between the two plates .    in this study ,",

    "therefore , the right hand side of equation ( [ eq : qs3 ] ) in general will be large in high-@xmath58 regions . when the operator @xmath125 in equation ( [ eq : qs3 ] ) is inverted to obtain the induced plasma flow , the flow is likely to be large in high-@xmath58 region as well . as a general rule",
    ", the resistively induced flow is large in a high-@xmath58 equilibrium , which can be considered as enhanced resistive diffusion due to field line exponentiation . as an example , the induced flow in run a3 reach a maximum @xmath135 , which is more than an order of magnitude larger than a naive estimate from balancing characteristic values of @xmath136 and @xmath137 , which yields @xmath138 .",
    "another factor that affects the induced plasma flow is how close the system is with respect to an ideal stability threshold .",
    "the formal solution ( [ eq : solution_qs ] ) diverges as the system approaches an ideal stability threshold , i.e. when @xmath139 for at least one eigenmode .",
    "if the system is close to an ideal stability threshold , i.e. some @xmath140 are small , the induced flow may become so large such that plasma inertia , friction , and viscosity are no longer negligible , and the evolution will deviate from being quasi - static .",
    "this may explain why the rescaled curves of four different runs in case a as shown in figure [ fig : rescale - a ] deviate from each other in the middle range of the plot , while they agree well with each other in the early and late stages . as an overall trend @xmath91 tends to decrease as the system evolves due to resistive decay of the magnetic field",
    "( see the movie of case a ) , therefore the induced flow energy should tend to decrease as well .",
    "however , the resistive quasi - static evolution may actually bring the system closer to a marginal stability threshold during the middle range .",
    "the fact that both the maximum flow @xmath93 and the total kinetic energy @xmath141 increase initially , even though @xmath91 is decreasing , lends support to this hypothesis .",
    "the formulation of quasi - static evolution here is similar to the one derived by @xcite[see also @xcite ] , except that in his case the evolution is driven by footpoint motion , instead of resistive diffusion .",
    "it is easy to generalize the formulation to incorporate footpoint motion and resistive diffusion at the same time . in the presence of footpoint motion prescribed by @xmath142 and @xmath143 at the bottom and top plates",

    "figure [ fig : restart ] shows the time histories of @xmath93 and @xmath92 from two runs , restarted from @xmath150 and @xmath151 , respectively . for the restart run from @xmath150 , the plasma flow",
    "is quickly damped away by friction and viscosity , and the system relaxes to a new equilibrium and stays there . on the contrary , for the restart run from @xmath151 , the plasma flow first decays and appears to be settling down initially but eventually starts to increase at @xmath152 .",
    "that leads to the formation of intense current sheets , sufficiently intense that they eventually become under - resolved .",
    "these results suggest that the system is still within an ideal stability threshold at @xmath150 , but has passed through the stability threshold at @xmath151 .",
    "the current sheets formed after the onset of the instability bear similarity with the ones caused by ideal coalescence and kink instabilities @xcite . however , due to the lack of ignorable coordinates in the equilibrium , analyzing the nature of the instability is a rather difficult task .",
    "although these results suggest that the onset may be caused by crossing an ideal mhd stability threshold , it is also possible that the system becomes resistively unstable before it reaches the ideal stability threshold .",
    "formally we can analyze the resistive instability by assuming that the background is not evolving , and linearizing equations ( [ eq : rmhd - momentum ] ) and ( [ eq : rmhd - faraday ] ) , which yields the following eigenvalue problem : @xmath153,\\label{eq : rmhd - momentum-1}\\ ] ] @xmath154 here @xmath155 and @xmath156 denote the linear perturbations of the flux function and current density , respectively ; and we have again neglected viscosity and friction . it has been previously found that as the system just crosses the resistive stability threshold in line - tied systems , the linear growth rate scales linearly with @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the reason is that near the stability threshold , the unstable mode is so slowly growing such that the inertia term @xmath157 in equation ( [ eq : rmhd - momentum-1 ] ) is negligible . in this regime ,",
    "the resistive instability is virtually indistinguishable from resistive quasi - static diffusion . however , as the system evolves further away from the stability threshold , the growth rate is expected to scale as @xmath158 , with @xmath159 , and becomes distinguishable from resistive diffusion . to further examine",
    "this possibility requires a clear separation between the resistive diffusion time scale @xmath103 and the resistive instability time scale @xmath160 , which is beyond the parameter regimes we are able to probe and is left to a future study .      ]    ]     ]    in section [ sec : simulation - results ] we present two cases where the evolutions of field line mapping follow qualitatively different behavior . in the first case governed by resistive quasi - static evolution ,",
    "run a3 , the field line mapping appears to deform gradually ; whereas in the second case , run b3 , the field line mapping rapidly changes to a qualitatively different pattern during the onset phase .",
    "although the difference between the two cases is rather obvious to the human eye , how to translate this qualitative observation to a precise quantitative definition of magnetic reconnection in three dimensions remains an open question . to further address this issue",
    ", we ask the important question : `` given two consecutive snapshots of field line mappings , how do we measure how different they are ? ''    a simple measure is the maximum footpoint drift between two consecutive snapshots separated by one alfvn transit time .",
    "however , as shown by the time histories of maximum footpoint drift in figure [ fig : time - histories - of - max - drift ] , the two cases a3 and b3 appear to be qualitatively similar . in both cases ,",
    "the maximum footpoint drift starts with a similar value @xmath161 , which gradually increases at later time , reaches a peak and then decays .",
    "the peak value of maximum footpoint drift in case b3 is approximately a factor of two higher than that in a3 , which does not seem very significant .",
    "the problem of taking the maximum value of footpoint drift is that , it tends to overemphasize the difference , especially when the field line mapping is highly distorted with large gradient , as in the present cases .",
    "this can be appreciated by a simple one dimensional analogy .",
    "consider a one dimensional function with a strong gradient , e.g. @xmath162 with @xmath163 , and a slightly shifted function @xmath164 .",
    "even though for all practical purposes @xmath165 and @xmath166 are very similar , the maximum value of @xmath167 is of order unity . in this case , instead of using the maximum value , the @xmath168 norm of the difference @xmath169 is a better measure of the `` distance '' between the two functions .    likewise , given two field line mappings @xmath170 and @xmath171 , where @xmath172 represents the coordinates at the bottom plate , we may measure the `` distance '' between them by the @xmath168 norm @xmath173 in our diagnostics , we approximate the @xmath168 norm by the root mean square ( rms ) footpoint drift of the sampled field lines , and figure [ fig : time - histories - of - rms - drift ] shows the time histories of the rms footpoint drift , for the two cases . as we can see , the @xmath168 norm gives a sharp distinction between the two cases during the onset phase of case b3 .",
    "another possible way of measuring the distance between two mappings is through coarse graining the field line connectivity .",
    "first we divide the bottom plate and the top plate into @xmath174 equal - sized cells for each of them .",
    "the coarse - grained representation of a field line mapping is the probability distribution @xmath175 , where @xmath176 is the probability of a field line to connect the @xmath177 cell at the bottom and the @xmath178 cell at the top . here",
    "again we make use of the doubly periodic boundary condition in defining field line connection between the two plates , such that bottom plate of the simulation box is exactly mapped to the top plate of the simulation box ( see figure [ fig : visualization - of - mapping ] ) .",
    "the probability distribution @xmath179 satisfies the relation @xmath180 after coarse - graining the field line mappings into probability distributions , we can measure the distance between two mappings by a proper measure of the distance between probability distributions .",
    "the motivation behind the coarse - graining approach is that , if the field line mapping deforms gradually in time , the probability distributions between two consecutive snapshots should be very similar , even though footpoints of individual field lines may drift a large distance .    given two probability distributions @xmath175 and @xmath181 , there are numerous standard ways to quantify the difference between them [ see , e.g. @xcite , chapter 2 , for an overview ] . here",
    "we employ the hellinger distance @xmath182 , defined as @xmath183 the hellinger distance satisfies the inequality @xmath184 .",
    "we divide each of the two end plates into @xmath185 cells , and calculate the hellinger distance between two consecutive field line mappings separated by one alfvn time by using the sampled field lines to estimate the probability distributions .",
    "figure [ fig : hellinger ] shows the resulting time histories of hellinger distance for the two cases a3 and b3 .",
    "as can be seen from the two curves in figure [ fig : hellinger ] , the hellinger distance is also very effective in distinguishing the onset phase and the quasi - static phase .",
    "in this study , we find two distinct phases in our simulations on resistive relaxation of 3d force - free equilibria . in the phase governed by resistive quasi - static evolution",
    ", it is found that kinetic energy tends to be high , and field line mapping can change rapidly in regions where neighboring field lines strongly exponentiate from each other ( i.e. high-@xmath58 regions ) . during this phase , the evolution time scale @xmath103 , as in resistive diffusion . whether we would call",
    "the change of field line mapping `` reconnection '' is to some extent a matter of definition .",
    "as we have seen , even though the mapping of individual field lines can change rapidly , the overall pattern of the mapping appears to deform gradually rather than to undergo rapid qualitative change .",
    "therefore , it may be more appropriate to call the rapid change of field line connectivity and high induced plasma flow in high-@xmath58 regions during this phase `` enhanced resistive diffusion '' rather than `` reconnection '' .",
    "on the other hand , we also find that in some cases resistive quasi - static evolution can cause an ideally stable initial force - free equilibrium to pass through a stability threshold , leading to an `` onset '' phase . during this onset phase ,",
    "intense current filaments develop , and the field line mapping change rapidly to a qualitatively different pattern on a timescale faster than @xmath103 .",
    "the plasma flow exhibits signatures of inflow and outflow in the vicinities of current filaments .",
    "when the same initial condition is relaxed with different @xmath16 , it is found that the current filaments become more intense the smaller the @xmath16 is .",
    "the presence of all these hallmarks of reconnection suggests that the change of field line connectivity in this onset phase may be more properly designated as `` reconnection '' . because of the different scaling relations with respect to @xmath16 , the difference between the two phases will become more distinct the smaller the @xmath16 is .",
    "our results illustrate a fundamental difference between 2d and 3d reconnection . in 2d",
    "the breaking of magnetic field line connectivity occurs in thin current sheets , therefore is much more closely coupled with magnetic energy conversion and dissipation ; whereas in 3d the breaking of magnetic field line connectivity does not require a large current density and , therefore , is not directly associated with a large energy release .",
    "for this reason , a proper definition of reconnection becomes a tricky issue .",
    "if we consider magnetic energy conversion and dissipation as one of the hallmarks of magnetic reconnection , then we must conclude that rapid change of field line connectivity appears to be necessary , but insufficient as a signature of fast reconnection .",
    "nonetheless , our results show that the meaning of the ideal constraints on magnetic field evolution is very subtle in 3d .",
    "because of the exponential sensitivity , strict conservation of field line mapping as dictated by ideal mhd is essentially impossible in a generic , high-@xmath58 3d magnetic field . on the other hand ,",
    "the fact the field line mapping can undergo gradual deformation even in the presence of a large apparent field line drift also calls for quantification of approximate conservation of ideal constraints other than direct measurement of individual footpoint drift .",
    "the measures of @xmath186 norm and hellinger distance in section [ sub : measuring - the - distance ] represent our preliminary attempt in this direction .",
    "the process of current sheet formation during the onset phase requires further investigation .",
    "when the evolution deviates from the force - free condition @xmath25 due to some instability , the large gradient in @xmath52 implies the likelihood of developing a large @xmath187 , where @xmath188 is the differential distance along a field line .",
    "a large @xmath187 implies a large current across the magnetic field , for otherwise the current density would not be divergence free .",
    "the force associated with current across the field lines must be balanced by inertia .",
    "this is just what is implied by equation ( [ eq : rmhd - momentum ] ) : a large @xmath187 implies a large time derivative in the vorticity of the flow @xmath189 .",
    "although the reported simulations have sufficient dissipation to prevent alfvn waves from bouncing back and forth , the relaxation of @xmath187 back to zero occurs by alfvn waves . as shown in @xcite , alfvn wave propagation in a high-@xmath58 region turns the part of @xmath52 that is not constant along a field line into a current ribbon of exponentially high current density as well as producing a vortex ribbon [ see also @xcite ] .",
    "the current and vortex ribbon can be rapidly dissipated by resistivity or viscosity . moreover",
    ", this mechanism can take place without the mediation of instabilities , as the large gradient in @xmath52 implies that any small perturbation in @xmath7 can potentially leads to a large @xmath190 .",
    "therefore , a general conclusion is that a high-@xmath58 force - free equilibrium is very fragile and can hardly remain quiescent .    from a broader perspective , the interesting",
    "finding that resistive quasi - static evolution can lead to an onset of instability and subsequent formation of thin current sheets may have profound implications on parker s `` topological dissipation '' scenario of coronal heating @xcite .",
    "in this scenario , it is suggested that when the magnetic field lines in solar coronal loops become entangled due to footpoint motions on the photosphere , the ideal magnetostatic equilibrium of the entangled field develops current singularities ( i.e. tangential discontinuities in magnetic field ) . in the presence of small but finite resistivity",
    ", the current singularities can dissipate resistively and heat the corona .",
    "parker s proposal has since become the famous parker problem and has stimulated a substantial amount of debate that continues to this day @xcite .",
    "the parker problem is usually posed as an ideal mhd problem , where the key question is whether the minimum energy equilibrium for a given magnetic topology , assuming ideal mhd constraints are exactly conserved , contains tangential discontinuity or not .",
    "this formulation of the parker problem is mathematically precise , and to some degree carries the connotation that formation of current sheets is purely an ideal mhd process , whereas the role of resistivity is to smooth out the singularity , to facilitate reconnection , and to dissipate the free energy .",
    "however , as neighboring field line exponentiation becomes significant as a natural consequence of continuous footpoint driving , conservation of ideal mhd constraints becomes subtle and may become overly restrictive .",
    "furthermore , our results show that a small resistivity can cause an otherwise ideally stable equilibrium to break loose and subsequently develop much more intense current filaments .",
    "therefore , it appears that resistivity can play an active , albeit subtle role in the formation of current sheets .",
    "consequently , the physically relevant question may not be the ideal problem , but the resistive problem in the limit of very small @xmath16 .",
    "this viewpoint has previously been emphasized by @xcite and now corroborated by the present study .",
    "a similar onset of instability has been reported in recent studies on resistive relaxation of braided force - free coronal loops @xcite . however , the onset time is approximately independent of @xmath16 in the reported simulations , whereas the onset time @xmath103 in the present study .",
    "therefore , the instabilities in the two types of studies are likely to be qualitatively different .",
    "the enhanced resistive diffusion reported in this work is conceptually different from the mechanism of breaking ideal mhd frozen - in condition via turbulent richardson advection as proposed by @xcite . in their scenario , the spontaneously stochastic trajectories caused by turbulent flow bring together field lines from distances far apart , which , as eyink et al . argued , results in breakdown of the frozen - in condition even in the limit @xmath191 . on the other hand ,",
    "the enhanced resistive diffusion in the present work is caused by the stochasticity in magnetic field line mapping .",
    "the plasma flow does not become turbulent in either the quiescent or onset phases .",
    "therefore , alfvn s frozen - in theorem is expected to be satisfied as @xmath191 .",
    "finally , we remark on some limitations of the present study .",
    "the initial conditions employed in this study are constructed by integrating @xmath25 from a given flux function @xmath192 at the mid - plane of the simulation box ; these initial conditions may not be representative of the generic force - free equilibria that arise more naturally , e.g. by imposing footpoint motion at the boundaries as in parker s model .",
    "the exponent @xmath58 in this work is rather modest due to the limitation of numerical resolution , while high-@xmath58 regions concentrate in layers . in astrophysical or space plasmas , the exponent @xmath58",
    "is expected to be significantly higher , and high-@xmath58 regions could be more volume - filling .",
    "other physical effects known to be important to reconnection , e.g. hall effect , electron pressure and inertia , are also not included .",
    "the conclusions of this study should be further examined under those conditions .",
    "the initial force - free equilibrium for simulation is constructed by integrating @xmath193=0\\label{eq : force - free}\\ ] ] along the @xmath6 direction from a prescribed @xmath194 at @xmath19 .",
    "although equation ( [ eq : force - free ] ) can in principle be integrated with any standard numerical scheme , because the constructed equilibrium is usually very delicate due to high field line exponentiation , it is important to employ exactly the same discretization scheme for both the simulation code and the integration ; otherwise , the discrepancy in discretization errors due to different numerical schemes may result in non - negligible unbalanced force when the constructed equilibrium is used as an initial condition for simulation .",
    "the simulation code employs staggered grids for variables @xmath10 and @xmath9 along the @xmath6 direction .",
    "that means that @xmath195 is evaluated at the middle point between two adjacent grid points where @xmath9 resides .",
    "specifically , the discretized representation for @xmath195 between the @xmath196^th^ and @xmath197^th^ grid points is     @xmath198,\\label{eq : discretization}\\ ] ] where @xmath199 is the grid size along @xmath6 ; the poisson bracket is calculated by a standard pseudospectral method , i.e. derivatives are carried out in the fourier space and products are calculated in the real space . when the discretized representation ( [ eq : discretization ] ) is used in equation ( [ eq : force - free ] ) , it becomes an implicit scheme that @xmath200 can be determined by inverting a nonlinear equation if @xmath201 is known .",
    "this nonlinear inversion is solved iteratively until a convergence criterion is satisfied . in this work ,",
    "the convergence criterion is set to be @xmath202    the corresponding problem in full mhd instead of rmhd is constructing a force - free equilibrium from all three components of @xmath7 given on a plane .",
    "this is an important problem in solar physics due to the great interest in extrapolating the coronal magnetic field from the photospheric magnetograms [ see , e.g. @xcite for a recent review and references therein ] . a straightforward generalization of the procedure here to full mhd is the well - known upward integration method @xcite , which integrates @xmath203 and @xmath204 simultaneously from the vector * * @xmath7 * * given at a plane ( assumed to be the @xmath19 plane in the following discussion ) . first the variable @xmath205 is determined by @xmath6 component of @xmath203 :     @xmath206 the remaining two components of @xmath203 then give the @xmath6 derivatives of @xmath207 and @xmath208 : @xmath209 @xmath210 finally , the @xmath6 derivative of @xmath211 is obtained from the condition @xmath204 :      however , the upward integration method in full mhd is known to be mathematically ill - posed and numerically unstable [ see , e.g. the discussions in @xcite ] .",
    "in particular , difficulties may arise near photospheric polarity inversion lines where @xmath213 ( which are present in most solar applications ) , as equation ( [ eq : alpha ] ) requires that the left hand side @xmath214 must vanish as well .",
    "therefore , the three components of @xmath7 at @xmath19 can not be arbitrarily prescribed but must satisfy the above mentioned constraint .",
    "although @xmath205 can in principle be obtained by applying lhspital s rule if the constraint is satisfied @xcite , any arbitrary small errors in @xmath7 can violate the constraint and render the boundary condition incompatible with the force - free condition .",
    "another drawback of the upward integration method for coronal magnetic field extrapolation is that the desirable asymptotic condition that the magnetic field vanishes at infinity can not be guaranteed because boundary conditions are only imposed at @xmath19 .",
    "direct integration of equations ( [ eq : alpha ] )  ( [ eq : dzbz ] ) usually leads to exponential growth of the magnetic field away from the boundary , and the solution is very sensitive to tiny changes of the boundary conditions .",
    "various techniques have been proposed to regularize the method @xcite , but can not be considered as fully successful .    in the context of the present study , however , the above mentioned limitations of the upward integration method",
    "are largely alleviated .",
    "the assumption of a strong @xmath211 ensures that equation ( [ eq : alpha ] ) is well - conditioned .",
    "furthermore , the force - free equations are only integrated over a finite distance , therefore the asymptotic behavior of @xmath7 is not a concern .",
    "it remains an interesting open question whether a force - free equilibrium can be constructed for full mhd by a method similar to the one presented here under these conditions ."
