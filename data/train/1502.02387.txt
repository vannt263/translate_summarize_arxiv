    "a catalog of proper motions in the * international * celestial reference system ( icrs ) , with precise positions and proper motions as well as deep * limiting * magnitude , is important for * research * on the galactic structure , galactic kinematics and stellar * populations*.    there are two methods to determine the absolute proper motions of stars based on the hypothesis that the proper motions of background galaxies are zero .",
    "one is that all the observations obtained in different epochs are transformed into one reference position system using galaxies , and absolute proper motions are calculated directly .",
    "for example , munn et al . (",
    "2004 ) took this method to construct the improved sdss proper motion catalog combining usno - b ( monet et al .",
    "2003 ) and sdss ( gunn et al . 1998",
    "; york et al . 2000 ; lupton et al . 2001 ; stoughton et al .",
    "the basic procedure in this work is as follows . for each object from usno - b ,",
    "the nearest 100 galaxies ( classified as @xmath11 by sdss morphological classification ) detected in both sdss and usno - b were selected .",
    "then the mean offsets in right ascension and declination between the sdss and usno - b positions were measured from the 100 nearest galaxies , and were added to the usno - b position of this object .",
    "finally the proper motions of objects in sdss were computed using a linear fit with the re - calibrated usno - b positions and the sdss positions at different epochs .",
    "the other method to determine absolute proper motions is to take a novel calibration method which iteratively uses the stellar sources and galaxies on each position system to eliminate all systematic errors between different position systems .",
    "absolute proper motions out side the plane ( apop ) adopted this technique with the guide star catalog ( gsc- ) schmidt plate data ( qi et al . 2012 ; lasker et al .",
    "meanwhile , the apop used the measured coordinates ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) of objects instead of equatorial coordinates to calculate the absolute proper motions .",
    "the principal calibration steps for apop are as follows .    1 .   removing the position - dependent systematic errors ( pde ) with a moving - mean filter using good - quality stellar objects ; 2 .",
    "selecting galaxies from non - point - like sources ( non - stars ) via their common null - motion characteristics ; 3 .   calibrating magnitude- and color- dependent ( mde and cde ) errors and the residual pde of all objects with respect to the galaxies selected above ; 4 .   calculating absolute proper motions from all - epoch plate data with a linear fit .",
    "the construction of the latest version of apop catalog and evaluation of the catalog are described in detail by qi et al .",
    "( 2014 ) . in this paper , we take almost the same method and pipeline as apop to derive absolute proper motions .",
    "the scuss ( zou et al . 2014 ; zhou et al . 2014 ; jia et al . 2014 ) is a @xmath1-band ( 3538  ) imaging survey using the @xmath14 bok telescope .",
    "the survey covers about 5000 square degrees .",
    "most of the scuss fields were observed twice in the course of survey from 2010 to 2013 .",
    "it is difficult to measure accurate proper motions for the scuss objects from the scuss data only . in this paper",
    ", we construct a scuss proper motion catalog by combining the scuss data with the gsc- schmidt plate data .",
    "the gsc- schmidt plate data is an all - sky astro - photometric data base which were derived from the digitization of the palomar and uk schmidt surveys .",
    "the gsc- contains astrometry , photometry and classification for objects down to the limiting magnitude of the plates .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we summarize the scuss program and gsc- project that are used to derive the scuss proper motion catalog .",
    "section 3 describes the construction of the scuss proper motion catalog . in section 4 , quasars are used to perform internal test of the proper motions .",
    "we compare the catalog with the sdss proper motion catalog in section 5 . we summarize the paper in section 6 .",
    "the scuss is a @xmath1-band imaging survey with an effective wavelength of @xmath0 3538   and a bandwidth @xmath0 345   .",
    "this @xmath1-band filter is slightly bluer than the sdss @xmath1-band filter .",
    "the imaging depth is @xmath0 @xmath15 , roughly @xmath16 deeper than that of the sdss imaging survey .",
    "the scuss project began its observations in september 2010 and ended in october 2013 .",
    "it covers a total 5000 square degrees .",
    "proper motions are measured with respect to a reference frame of galaxies .",
    "hence , the accuracy of star / galaxy classification affects systematic error of the proper motions .",
    "the scuss proper motion catalog covers 3700 square degrees ( galactic latitude @xmath17 and * equatorial latitude @xmath18 * ) . in this area ,",
    "the accuracy of star / galaxy classification is reliable .",
    "the spatial distribution of the scuss proper motion catalog is shown in figure 1 .",
    "most of the images in this area were taken with seeing @xmath19 , sky background @xmath20 adu .",
    "the description of reduction of the scuss data can be found in zou et al.(2014 ) .",
    "photometry was done using sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) . the measured @xmath12 and @xmath13 positions were calculated by applying sextractor to sources brighter than 1@xmath21 of the background level .",
    "external astrometric errors were determined by crossing - matching the scuss sources to the ucac4 sources ( zacharias et al .",
    "2013 ) . over the whole survey ,",
    "the mean offsets of right ascension and declination between the scuss and ucac4 are @xmath22 , @xmath23 , respectively . in this work",
    ", we will * construct * a proper motion catalog using the measured coordinates ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) , the celestial coordinates ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) , the @xmath1-band magnitudes from scuss and the star / galaxy morphological classifications from sdss for objects on scuss images . the basic information for each frame including plate size and scale as well as observation time is also needed in the process of calculation of proper motions .",
    "gsc- ( lasker et al . 2008 ) , as first epoch data to obtain the proper motions of scuss , was originally taken from the survey plates observed by the palomar schmidt telescope and the uk schmidt telescope .",
    "each individual plate was digitized by the guide star automatic measuring machine ( gamma ) and was processed through image processing and plate calibration .",
    "the final products were stored in the compass database ( lasker et al .",
    "gsc- contains astrometry , multi - band photometry ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) and star / non - star classification for objects down to the limiting magnitude of the survey plates .",
    "for stellar sources , the all - sky average absolute position error per coordinate ranges from @xmath29 to @xmath30 depending on magnitude .",
    "stellar photometry is determined to @xmath31 as a function of magnitude and photographic passbands ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) . outside of the galactic plane ,",
    "the catalogue is complete to @xmath32 .",
    "there are about 1210 schmidt plates from different surveys used in this paper .",
    "the main characteristics of the surveys used in this paper including the epoch , band , limiting magnitude and sky coverage as well as the number of plates used in this work are summarized in table 1 . the basic information for objects on each plate including the measured coordinates , the equatorial coordinates , magnitude and classification ( star / non - star ) is needed in this paper . in addition , the basic information for each plate from gsc- data base including telescope name , plate size and scale , observation time is also needed .",
    "two major aspects determine the final accuracy of absolute proper motions .",
    "one is the measured uncertainties of object positions on the images of all epochs , and the other one is the systematic error between different images .",
    "the latter one requires unifying images in different epochs and different bands to one reference system ( qi et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "the general steps of the construction of the scuss proper motion catalog are similar to * those * of apop .",
    "relevant equations and details are recommend to see the paper of qi et al .",
    "a few steps are slightly different . the steps are summarized as follows .    1 .",
    "extract all the gsc- plates and scuss images in the same sky field ; 2 .",
    "compare gsc- reference plates with the sdss , update the star / non - star classification in gsc with star / galaxy in the sdss ; 3 .",
    "reject the synthetic double stars ( stars with the same i d ) in each gsc- plate ; 4 .",
    "find common objects between the program images and the reference plate ; 5 .",
    "smooth out position - dependent difference between each image pair using stars with small measuring error ; 6 .",
    "regenerate the @xmath12 , @xmath13 of all the objects on program plates using galaxies and remove the mde , cde and residual pde of proper motions ; 7 .",
    "calculate the absolute proper motions and new positions in a given epoch using all the images .",
    "the plates , which are from gsc- with good quality and overlap with the scuss , were chosen as reference plates .",
    "the star / galaxy classifications of sources play an important role in the calculation of the proper motions .",
    "however , in gsc- , the probability of stars correctly classified drops with magnitude from better than @xmath33 at @xmath34 to less than @xmath35 at @xmath36 , while the percentage that a galaxy is classified as non - star remains above @xmath33 for all the magnitude range . outside of the galactic plane",
    ", stellar classification is reliable to at least 90% confidence for magnitudes brighter than @xmath37 ( lasker et al .",
    "the low accuracy of star / non - star classification of the fainter objects of the gsc- reference plates eventually affect the error of the proper motions . in our work ,",
    "most of the scuss survey are covered by the sdss , star / galaxy separation of sdss is about @xmath38 correct at 21.0 mag in @xmath39 band ( stoughton et al .",
    "so , we update the gsc- star / non - star classification with the star / galaxy classification from sdss morphological classification .",
    "the scuss proper motion catalog contains the equatorial coordinates ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) , the absolute proper motions ( @xmath40 , @xmath5 ) , and the scuss @xmath1-band magnitudes for about 7.7 million objects .",
    "the proper motions of quasars can not be detected by present astrometric observation in the optical band , so the intrinsic proper motions of quasars can be considered as zero ( wu et al .",
    "therefore , the measured proper motions of quasars can be used to derive the systematic and random error of the proper motion .",
    "we choose the spectroscopically confirmed quasars from sdss dr9 ( ahn et al .",
    "a total of 22831 common quasars among the sdss and scuss catalog are selected as a quasar sample .",
    "the gaussian function is used to fit the distribution of the quasar proper motions to derive the systematic and random error .",
    "the systematic error of proper motions is derived from the mean proper motion of the quasar sample .",
    "the dispersion of the proper motions of quasars can be considered as the random error of proper motions .",
    "figure 2 displays the histograms of the measured proper motions in right ascension @xmath40 ( upper ) and in declination @xmath5 ( lower ) for all sdss spectroscopically confirmed quasars in scuss proper motion catalog .",
    "the random errors of the proper motions are 4.2 and @xmath41 in @xmath40 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "the systematic error of @xmath40 is about @xmath42 and the systematic error of @xmath5 is about @xmath3 .",
    "next , all the 22831 quasars are used to test the position- , magnitude- and color- dependent errors of the scuss proper motions .",
    "the scatters of @xmath40 ( upper ) and @xmath5 ( lower ) of the selected quasar sample as a function of @xmath24 and @xmath25 are shown in figures 3 and 4 , respectively . in order to derive the position - dependent error of the proper motions",
    ", quasars are divided into different position groups with a group size of @xmath43 ( in declination ) and @xmath44 ( in right ascension ) . in figures 3 and 4 ,",
    "red points and red error bars show the systematic and random errors of the quasar proper motions in different groups . as mentioned above",
    ", the systematic and random errors correspond to the mean and dispersion of the best fit gaussian function of the distribution of proper motions for quasar groups .",
    "figure 3 shows that , for @xmath45cos@xmath25 , there is no significant dependence of the systematic or random errors in the @xmath24 direction .",
    "the systematic errors of @xmath45cos@xmath25 for quasar groups are small and fluctuate around zero .",
    "the random errors of @xmath45cos@xmath25 are about @xmath46 .",
    "in addition , there is also no significant dependence of the errors of @xmath5 in @xmath24 direction .",
    "the systematic errors of @xmath5 fluctuate around zero .",
    "the random errors of @xmath5 are around @xmath46 and do not significantly change with @xmath24 . from figure 4 , we can see that there is no significant relation between error ( systematic and random error ) of proper motions and @xmath25 .",

    "the random errors of proper motions are about @xmath46 .",
    "so , from figures 3 and 4 , we can find that the pde of scuss proper motion catalog is well eliminated and the random errors of the proper motions do not significantly change with position .",
