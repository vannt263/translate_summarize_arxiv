    "many of the masses serving as lenses in gravitational lensing events are planetary systems , binaries , or higher - order multiples .",
    "as the lensing events proceed , the bodies constituting the lens system continue to orbit each other .",
    "orbital motion changes the magnification pattern as the lens passes in front of the lensed source .",
    "when the event lasts longer than the time required for a significant change in orbital phase , the light curve may exhibit unique characteristics .    in this paper",
    ", we establish that a significant fraction of all light curves exhibiting evidence of lens multiplicity should also provide detectable signatures of orbital motion .",
    "our focus is on identifying the characteristics of those systems for which orbital motion produces detectable features in gravitational lensing light curves , the `` characteristics '' we consider include intrinsic properties ( mass and orbital properties ) , and also the placement of the binary relative to us ( distance and the orientation of its orbit )",
    ". for systems likely to exhibit the effects of orbital motion , we study the range of possible effects and consider how these effects can be identified and studied . search for orbital motion will make lensing observations more effective in discovering binaries and planetary systems .",
    "these searches will become more successful as we move to an era in which ( 1 )  lensing events caused by nearby stars can be predicted ( lpine & distefano 2012 ) , ( 2 )  the photometric and astrometric precision of several space missions can be applied to lensing studies ( _ kepler _ ( borucki & koch 2012 ) , _ tess _ ( ricker et al . 2014 ) , _ wfirst _ ( yee et al .",

    "lensing light curves can display dramatic changes from the point - lens form when the lens is a binary or planetary system .",
    "early investigations of lens multiplicity focused on cases in which the event duration is so much shorter than the orbital period that orbital motion produced subtle or negligible effects , indeed , evidence of rotation discovered so far has been found in a handful of systems that have experienced modest changes in orbital phase during the lensing event .",
    "( 2008 ) considered the case in which the orbital period is comparable to or smaller than the event duration . in this cases , close approaches to a binary lens",
    "can produce light curves that are far more complex than the most intricate light curves generated by a non - rotating binary lens .",
    "the top panel of figure  1 of that paper shows the result of a head - on approach at low speed to a double brown - dwarf binary .",
    "the event exhibits @xmath3 caustic crossings and @xmath4 additional obvious peaks .",
    "although the binary completed approximately two orbits during the detectable portion of the event , the light - curve pattern is not obviously periodic , but there is some evidence of quasiperiodic behavior in the low - magnification wings of the light curve .",
    "it is not clear whether such a light curve would have been identified as a candidate lensing event , particularly in the earlier incarnations of the lensing monitoring teams .",
    "of course the approach between source and lens in this case was special , in order that the source would pass over regions with highly perturbed patterns of magnification . in the more typical cases considered in this paper , the perturbations are milder .",
    "nevertheless , the complexity of the light curves and model fits increases when the effects of orbital period , including possibly several objects in orbit , orientation on the sky play significant roles .    & night ( 2008 ) extended the study of orbital rotation during events to the case of planets .",
    "they showed earby planets orbiting in the habitable zones of their stars , the ratio of orbital period to event duration is also favorable for the detection of orbital motion .    to study the effects of a range of ratios between the event duration and orbital period , we utilize the concepts of the einstein angle and the einstein radius . when the source , lens , and observer are perfectly aligned , the image of the source is a ring whose angular radius is referred to as the einstein angle , @xmath5 .",
    "when the alignment is not exact , there are two images , whose separation is comparable to @xmath6    when the angular separation between the distant source and intervening lens is equal to @xmath7 the total magnification is @xmath8 .",
    "the einstein radius as projected onto the lens plane is just @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the distance to the lens .",
    "@xmath11:= .01 sqrt[1/1.4 100/50]%\\noindent{setting scales }   % out[3]= 0.0119523\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the total mass of the lens and @xmath13 is the distance to the lensed source .",
    "the effects of lens binarity are most pronounced when @xmath14 the projected separation between the binary components is comparable to @xmath15 it is convenient to define @xmath16 many of the binaries and planetary systems observed as lenses so far tend to have values of @xmath17 between roughly @xmath18  and   @xmath19 .    for a solar - mass lens located halfway between us and the bulge , @xmath20  au . is maximized at the point halfway between the source and lens , the midpoint between the earth and the galactic center , with @xmath21  kpc is often used for illustrative purposes .",
    "] the orbital period for binary lenses with @xmath22 can therefore be several years .",
    "in contrast , typical event durations have been on the order of days , weeks , or months . under these circumstances ,",
    "the orbital phase should not change very much during an event , and indeed , with hundreds of binary - lens events identified , phase shifts have been measured in only a handful of cases , and the values tend to be small ( dominik 1998 , albrow et al .",
    "2000 , an et al",
    ". 2000 ) .",
    "dominik ( 1998 ) considered the effects of orbital rotation , including cases in which either the lens or source is a binary .",
    "he found that , of these effects , binary - lens rotation produces the most significant light - curve perturbations .",
    "he identified an acceptable model fit to the duo#2 event that includes the effect of rotation , but the phase change during the event was small , since the einstein radius crossing time was @xmath23  days , while the binary orbital period was @xmath24  days .",
    "ioka et al .",
    "( 1999 ) found that kepler rotation should be significant for binary lenses in the magellanic clouds , although orbital effects were not needed to fit macho lmc-9 , a binary - lens event .",
    "dubath et al .",
    "( 2008 ) considered fast - rotating lenses , but miscomputed the light curves by not including the important non - linear effects associated with binary lenses .",
    "more recently , penny et al . ( 2011a ) carried out a simulation of microlensing events produced by the galactic binary population , and also penny et al .",
    "2011b computed the detection efficiency for orbital effects .",
    "unsurprisingly , they find that averaged over all relevant parameters ( distances , binary periods and separations , relative velocities , etc . ) , the detectable fraction is considerably lower than 0.1% this is of course consistent with the general consensus that such events are very rare , which is why the effects of orbital motion in microlensing were largely ignored for so long . more importantly , penny et al .",
    "explored the effects of different microlensing parameters on the rate of orbital motion detection .",
    "however , because their study focused on population averages , the interpretation of their results is not always straight - forward , since it depends on the authors choices for the distributions of critical parameters ( e.g. lens distances , periods , etc . ) . in any case",
    ", binary population calculations are complicated by the need to incorporate stellar and binary evolution as well as planetary systems .",
    "calculations conducted to calculate the rate of type ia supernovae , for example , give different results when performed by different groups ( nelemans et al .",
    "furthermore , there is evidence that even the `` initial conditions '' , corresponding to the range of orbital periods , masses , mass ratios , and eccentricities in primordial binaries , need to be better established ( moe & distefano 2013a , 2013b ) .    in this paper",
    "we therefore take a different approach .",
    "we identify the sets of system and event parameters that allow orbital motion to significantly influence the form of the light curve .",
    "we study the effects .",
    "we then consider a range of physical and mathematical symmetries that identify a huge range of systems expected to produce similar light curves .",
    "some of these systems have low mass stars , others are high - mass binaries .",
    "some have short orbital periods , others orbital periods of hundreds of days .",
    "some are near to us , and some ar close to the source star .",
    "we thereby show that the effects of orbital motion are likely to be ubiquitous .",
    "we show that a calculational method , developed by guo et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , is needed to search for and consistently find evidence for it , and to reliably measure binary orbital periods .      in  2",
    "we identify the regions of the parameter space for planetary and binary systems in which orbital motion should influence the lensing signatures .",
    "we find that for some sets of event parameters , the effects of orbital motion can be detected even for binary lenses with orbital periods of tens to hundreds of days .",
    "furthermore , the effects of lensing and the binary nature of the lens can be more detectable when the light curve carries information about orbital motion .",
    "we illustrate these results by considering a binary located at a fixed distance @xmath10 from the observer , computing the effects of rotation for a range of orbital separations .",
    "in  3 we turn to a set of five instructive examples with a broad range of physical properties to demonstrate the connection between the rotating geometry of the lens and the lensing signature .",
    "although the number of systems we consider is relatively small , we show that each represents a large set of binaries .",
    "section  4 is devoted to our conclusions .",
    "we find that a large fraction of those planetary systems and binaries for which the lensing event provides evidence of a companion , the light curve is also significantly influenced by orbital motion .",
    "furthermore , the effects of orbital motion extend the range of values of the orbital separation for which lens multiplicity can be discovered , and teach us more about the multiple system that served as a lens .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of how observational studies can identify more events exhibiting orbital motion .",
    "we start by considering a point - like lens of mass @xmath25 the lens position defines the center of a set of circular isomagnification contours projected onto the sky . if we define @xmath26 to be the projected distance between the lens and the background source , expressed in units of the einstein radius , @xmath27 the magnification depends only on the value of @xmath26 : @xmath28=(u^2 + 2)/(u \\sqrt{u^2 + 4})$ ] . because the lens has no structure , all angles of approach are equivalent , and the lensing light curve is symmetric about a peak magnification that occurs at the time of closest approach between the lens and a background source of light .",
    "lensing model fits to the light curve provide the value of the distance of closest approach , the time of closest approach , the baseline magnitude , and a time duration @xmath29 defined to be the time required for the lens - source distance to change by @xmath30 the value of @xmath31 is the only measurable quantity that depends on the lens mass , @xmath25 measuring @xmath31 does not , however , provide a unique measure of the lens mass , because value of @xmath31 is also determined by the distances to the lens and source ( @xmath10 and @xmath13 , respectively ) , and the value @xmath32 of the relative transverse speed .",
    "the lensing solution is therefore highly degenerate .",
    "lens binarity breaks the axisymmetry , and expresses itself through deviations in the isomagnification contours .",
    "when the path of a distant star passes behind regions that deviate from the point - lens pattern , the lensing light curve exhibits distinctive features .",
    "because these features introduce a physical scale , they can help to break the degeneracy discussed above .",
    "for example , sometimes finite - source - size effects can be detected when binary - lens effects introduce short - lived deviations ; these can allow us to measure the size of @xmath7 and to thereby directly relate the mass of the lens to its distance from us .",
    "the spatial structure of the deformations , and therefore the shapes of the light curves depend on the binary s physical characteristics . for static binaries the two key quantities are the mass ratio @xmath33 between the binary components and the projected orbital separation , @xmath34 .",
    "we define @xmath35 where @xmath36 .",
    "lensing is not directly sensitive to the 3-dimensional orbital separation , but instead depends on the value of the @xmath14 the orbital separation projected onto the plane of the sky .",
    "the effects are determined by the ratio @xmath37    for a given value of @xmath38 the effects of binarity on the isomagnification contours are small for values of @xmath33 in the range typical of planets , but the linear dimensions of the regions in which there are significant perturbations increase with increasing @xmath33 .",
    "some examples are shown in figure [ binary ] , with the patterns in the top , middle , and bottom rows corresponding to @xmath39 and @xmath40 respectively .",
    "for a given value of @xmath41 the size of the region in which there are significant perturbations is typically largest for @xmath42 as @xmath17 increases above unity , the isomagnification contours begin to mimic the contours expected from two separate lenses . as @xmath17 decreases below unity , the region with large photometric deviations from the point - lens form shrinks .",
    "the progression from small to large @xmath17 can seen by scanning from left to right in each row of figure 1 .    because the deviations shrink for smaller values of @xmath38 most previous investigations",
    "have not explicitly considered small @xmath43 nevertheless , at small @xmath38 there is a region of perturbations at a distance roughly equal to @xmath44 from the center of mass ( distefano 2012 , distefano & night 2008 ) .",
    "this is illustrated in the left - hand panels of figure  1 and is addressed in detail for planets in  2012 .",
    "we also include examples of small-@xmath17 binaries in this paper .",
    "the value of the orbital period , @xmath45 depends on the value of the total system mass , @xmath12 which is also the mass that enters into the expressions for the einstein radius , @xmath46 , and for the einstein diameter crossing time , @xmath31 .",
    "the value of @xmath47 also depends on the size , @xmath48 of the semimajor axis .",
    "if we define @xmath49 then @xmath50 it is not , however , @xmath51 that determines the shapes of the isomagnification contours . instead , it is the instantaneous value of the projected separation , expressed in units of @xmath46 : @xmath52 . in general @xmath53 for eccentric orbits",
    "viewed nearly face - on , @xmath54 near apastron .",
    "near periastron , or for inclined orbits @xmath55 .",
    "it is convenient to express @xmath47 as follows .",
    "@xmath56^{1\\over 4}\\ ] ]    in order for the effects of orbital motion to play a role in altering the shape of the light curve , the binary axis must rotate significantly while the event is in progress .",
    "we must therefore compare the time scale of the event to the orbital period .",
    "the time scale for photometric events is set by the value of @xmath57 where @xmath32 is the relative transverse velocity of the source in the frame of the lens .",
    "@xmath58 which combined with eq .",
    "( [ period ] ) gives us the timescale ratio @xmath59^{1\\over 4}.\\ ] ]      the timescale ratio , @xmath60 , can indeed be very small ( i.e. rotation is unimportant ) for large values of @xmath17 , @xmath32 , and @xmath61 .",
    "however , in this section we demonstrate that the value of @xmath62 large enough to produce detectable effects for a wide range of binary - lens parameters .",
    "a useful criterion is that the binary should execute an orbit during an interval of time equal to @xmath63 .",
    "this roughly corresponds to completing an orbit during the interval when the magnification is greater than @xmath64 today s ground - based missions can , in principle , track the light curve through even lower values of the magnification .",
    "space missions can do even better . in data taken by the _",
    "kepler _ mission , _ tess _ , or _",
    "wfirst _ , an event is potentially detectable during the interval when the lens - source separation is as large as @xmath65 larger orbital periods would still produce significant deviations from the point - lens light curve shape .    imposing the condition @xmath66 and using eq .",
    "( [ period ] ) to eliminate @xmath51 in favor of @xmath47 , implies a maximum orbital period , @xmath67 @xmath68^{1/2}.\\ ] ] note that orbital effects can be detected even when the orbital period is somewhat longer .",
    "figure 2 illustrates the range of orbital periods for which binary and rotational effects are potentially detectable , as a function of distance @xmath10 to the lens .",
    "each panel corresponds to a specific value of the lens mass , ranging from @xmath69 in the top panel to @xmath70 in the bottom panel . in each panel",
    ", there is an upper and lower black curve showing @xmath47 versus @xmath10 for , respectively , @xmath71 , @xmath72 .",
    "this range of @xmath17 roughly corresponds to the range over which lens binarity can significantly affect the shape of the light curve , even for static lenses .",
    "thus , if a lens lies between these two curves , lens binarity is potentially detectable , even without the effects of orbital motion .",
    "it is important to note that , in the static - lens case , not every detected lensing light curve exhibits detectable evidence of binarity , even for systems for binaries in the region between @xmath72 and @xmath73 instead , depending on the sensitivity and cadence of the observations , there is a finite probability , often small , that lens binarity will be detectable . the probability of detecting binarity is proportional to the probability that the source track will pass behind a region with isomagnification perturbations , and is therefore proportional to the linear size of the perturbed regions",
    ". the probability increases with larger values of the mass ratio @xmath33 , and for values of @xmath17 close to unity .",
    "the colored curves in each panel plot @xmath74 versus @xmath10 .",
    "each curve corresponds to a particular value of the relative velocity , indicated by the curve s color ( red : @xmath75  km  s@xmath76 ; green : @xmath77  km  s@xmath76 ; blue : @xmath78  km  s@xmath76 ) .",
    "for all systems located _ beneath _ a curve of a given color ( whether or not @xmath79 ) , rotational motion is potentially detectable , since @xmath80    note that in each panel , the region between the green curve ( @xmath74 for @xmath81  km  s@xmath76 ) and the bottom black curve ( @xmath47 for @xmath72 ) is cross hatched . for binaries in this cross - hatched region , there is a significant probability that the light - curve perturbations associated with binarity will exhibit rotational effects .",
    "rotational effects can lead to the repetition of deviations , making it possible to reliably identify small deviations whose significance would otherwise be unclear .",
    "thus , the region in which binarity can be detected may be extended to smaller values of @xmath17 by the effects of orbital motion .",
    "this is illustrated in figure 4 .",
    "figure [ prange.small ] is a blow - up of the small @xmath10 region of figure [ prange ] , for a lens mass of @xmath82 the region with horizontal shading above the curve for @xmath72 is the same as the shaded region in figure [ prange ] .",
    "the region with vertical shading shows the effects of extending the systems of interest to those with lower values of @xmath17 . for these small values of @xmath17 ,",
    "the expected photometric deviations from a single lens lightcurve form are tiny . however ,",
    "if they can be detected ( with space observations or improved ground - based photometry ) , the orbital motion can be so rapid that the interval during which the event occurs encompasses many orbital periods producing strong rotation signature ( see figure [ lcresiduals ] ) .",
    "* light curve morphology : * the effects of orbital motion can be predicted by studying the magnification patterns shown in figure [ binary ] .",
    "events are produced when a source track passes behind the region near the einstein ring of the lens .",
    "when the lens is rotating , the magnification pattern rotates and/or oscillates .",
    "first consider a case in which the binary is face on .",
    "this is an important case , since lensing is sensitive to binarity in face - on orbits , while transit and radial - velocity methods are not .",
    "thus , lensing studies can provide important information about binaries and planetary systems that complements what we learn through other methods .",
    "for a face - on orbit , the effects or orbital motion can be the following . a source track",
    "which , for a static lens , would have passed behind no distinctive features , will now have the features rotate into its path .",
    "in general , the number of distinctive features , such as caustic crossings and peaks and dips in the magnification , is increased by binary rotation .",
    "edge - on orbits are also accessible to lensing studies . in this case , the pattern of isomagnification contours does nt rotate , but instead it changes because the projected separation between the binary components changes with orbital phase . as the value of @xmath17 increases and decreases , the magnification pattern oscillates .",
    "we can see this in the rows of figure 1 , by considering the sequence from left to right and then from right to left .",
    "in general , an orbit will have an arbitrary orientation on the sky , and both rotational effects and the effects of changing values of @xmath17 will influence the light curve .",
    "eccentric orbits , whatever their orientation , also pass through a range of values of @xmath17 as the orbit proceeds .",
    "thus , whatever the orbital orientation or eccentricity , a common feature of orbiting - binary light curves is that they exhibit more structure than is typical for static binary - lens light curves .",
    "it is important to note that , even if the orbital period is too long for the light curve deviations to repeat , light curve model fits can nevertheless be used to derive the value of @xmath83    * repetitions : * for events that are detectable over several orbital periods , we should be able to determine that the signal is periodic and to measure the period .",
    "tests for periodicity are complicated by ( 1 )  the time dependence of the overall magnification , ( 2 )  the shape of typical isomagnification contours , and ( 3 )  the combination of translational and orbital motion . to test for periodicity ,",
    "we have conducted a lomb - scargle analysis on each light curve . to minimize the effects of trends in the overall magnification",
    ", we identify the best fitting point - lens light curve , and subtract this from the observed light curve . to minimize the effects of the linear structures displayed in many binary - lens isomagnification contours ( which can produce two significant perturbations per orbit ) ,",
    "we multiply measured periods by a factor of @xmath84 .",
    "( this is not necessary for small values of @xmath33 . )",
    "it is more challenging to correct for the contribution of translational motion . in this paper",
    "we simply show the limitations of the standard approach , and develop an improved method in a separate paper ( guo et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "to illustrate the effects orbital motion has on microlensing lightcurves we have chosen nine representative binary lensing systems shown as blue triangles and red stars in figure [ prange.small ] .",
    "each binary has the same total mass ( @xmath85 ) and the same mass ratio ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "thus , they could be double m - dwarf systems , double white - dwarf systems ( double degenerates ) , or white - dwarf / m - dwarf binaries .",
    "each binary is located @xmath87 pc from earth .",
    "these values of @xmath88 and @xmath10 produce @xmath89au and @xmath90  mas . to generate light curves",
    ", we set @xmath81  km / s , producing a value for the einstein diameter crossing time of @xmath91  days , for all the systems and kept the distance of closest approach at @xmath92 in every case , we assumed face - on circular orbits .",
    "the only difference among our nine systems is the orbital period ( or orbital separation ) .",
    "figure [ lcperiods ] shows ( in black ) the light curve for each system represented by a blue dot in figure [ prange.small ] , in order of increasing period .",
    "a random orbital phase was chosen at the start of each computation .",
    "also shown in red in each panel is the binary - lens light curve that would have been obtained if there were no orbital motion . to make a meaningful comparison",
    ", we matched the trajectory phases at the moment of closest approach we describe each panel , starting with the smallest value of @xmath17 and working toward higher values . on the top left is the panel for @xmath93 yielding an orbital period of @xmath94  days .",
    "the value of @xmath31 is @xmath95 times the orbital period .",
    "thus , roughly @xmath75 orbital periods will pass during the time when the magnification is greater than @xmath96 . by comparing the black ( with rotation ) and red ( no rotation ) curves we can clearly see the periodic modulations . however , the magnitude of the signal is low , because the distortion of the isomagnification contours for @xmath72 is slight .",
    "nevertheless , applying the lomb - scargle analysis as described above , we identify a period at a high level of significance .",
    "the value we derive , after correcting by the factor of @xmath84 , is @xmath97 days , differing by less than 10% from the true period of @xmath94 days .",
    "the middle panel in the top row shows the binary - lens light curve for @xmath98 .",
    "the larger value of @xmath17 yields larger deviations from the non - rotating light curve .",
    "the timescale ratio @xmath62 is smaller for this system , so the translational motion of the binary center of mass has a stronger distorting effect on the rotational signature .",
    "indeed , an orbital period of @xmath99  days recovered by the lomb - scargle analysis is @xmath100 lower than the true period of @xmath101  days .",
    "this trend continues with the third panel in the first row , for which @xmath102 producing an orbital period of @xmath103  days , just slightly smaller than the value of @xmath104 here , too , the periodicity is clear in the lomb - scargle periodogram , but the derived value is @xmath105  days , @xmath106 lower than the actual value .",
    "the light curves in the bottom row of figure [ lcperiods ] are generated by binaries with larger values of @xmath38 and , consequently , longer orbital periods . in each case ,",
    "@xmath107 and the periodogram analysis does not show a significant periodicity . nevertheless , the rotational effects are large enough that the light curves for rotating binaries are significantly more complex than their corresponding static - binary counterparts , except possibly for the example with @xmath108 .",
    "the red dots in figure [ prange.small ] all correspond to values of @xmath17 smaller than @xmath109 in these cases , the deviations from the point - lens form are very small and would likely not be detected in the absence of orbital motion .",
    "the periods are short enough ( @xmath110  days , @xmath75  days , @xmath111  day ) , however , that there are many orbital revolutions during a typical lensing event . as a result ,",
    "the periodic nature of the photometric fluctuations is very obvious , as long as they can be detected .",
    "figure [ lcresiduals ] shows the residuals between the best - fit point - lens light curve in each case and the binary - lens light curve .",
    "for the cases of @xmath110  days and @xmath75  days , millimagnitude photometry would detect the deviations from the point - lens form .",
    "for the 1-day orbit , photometric sensitivity comparable to that of _ kepler _ or the upcoming _ tess _ mission would be needed . in all three cases ,",
    "the orbital period would be extracted by the lomb - scargle analysis with a high degree of confidence and precision .",
    "figure [ lcpower ] shows the results for the lomb - scargle analysis ( with the factor of 2 correction for the period , as described above ) of the three lightcurves taken from those shown in figures [ lcperiods ] and [ lcresiduals ] . for the longest period system",
    "there is no convincing signal , since actual period of the binary here is more than half of the total duration of the event ( which we have taken to be @xmath112 , roughly corresponding to overall magnification above @xmath96 ) . by contrast",
    ", the middle panel shows the case where a 175-day period is detected with very high significance .",
    "this result is expected , since for this system @xmath113 , so the binary undergoes over 3 complete revolutions while the event is detectable .",
    "however , the detected period is _ not _ equal to the binary period of the system .",
    "this discrepancy is due to the motion of the source with respect to the binary . in guo",
    "et al . ( 2011 ) we discuss a modified timing analysis approach that allows us to extract correct periods for such systems .",
    "finally , the lower panel shows that there is no problem extracting the correct period for the systems where the event duration is many times higher than the orbital period ( since here the motion of the source is negligible over one orbital period of the lens ) .",
    "in this section we display magnification maps and light curves for a small number of binaries , but begin by showing that each represents a much larger set of binaries that can generate light curves that are identical or else similar in all essential details to the ones shown here .",
    "the crucial issue for detecting evidence of orbital motion is the ratio of the time duration of the event , to the time required for a significant change of phase to occur .",
    "we use the parameter @xmath62 as a proxy for this ratio , but the exact value of @xmath62 is not crucial , because the duration of the detectable event may be longer or shorter than @xmath31 , while the required orbital phase change can be smaller than or larger than @xmath114 .",
    "if , for example , the photometry and sampling are good enough to allow the detection of an event over long intervals of time , or if the event is studied astrometrically , then orbital effects can be significant for relatively values of @xmath62 of @xmath75 or more .    to study a variety of situations , we consider the @xmath4 systems ( binaries and planetary systems ) listed in table  1 .",
    "together , these systems span a range of mass ratios from unity to the planetary regime and of primary masses from those characteristic of planets or brown dwarfs to those associated with stellar - mass bhs .",
    "although in  2 we showed that both smaller and larger values for @xmath17 can be associated with detectable rotation - induced deviations , here we concentrate on a somewhat more limited range of @xmath17 .",
    ".a summary of parameters for the five representative binary lens systems discussed in this section .",
    "we list primary and secondary masses , semi - major axis , orbital period , lens and source distances , relative transverse velocity @xmath115 , @xmath38 and the timescale ratio @xmath62 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      there are three ways in which a single system exhibiting the effects of phase changes can represent a larger range of different systems .",
    "the first is that a new system can have the same orbital parameters , be located in the same place relative to us , and have the same transverse velocity , but the physical density of the lens can be different .",
    "thus , a mass of roughly @xmath116 may correspond to a main sequence star , a giant star , a white dwarf , or a neutron star .",
    "systems with compact objects are common , because many lens systems are old enough that one or both components of a binary or higher - order multiple have evolved , and roughly @xmath117 of these systems will have undergone one or two epochs of mass transfer .",
    "the second way in which an individual system represents many others , is through the similarity of the light curves to those generated by systems with somewhat different parameters .",
    "considering , for example , the characteristics of the binary lens , figure  1 shows that the shape of the isomagnification contours and the positions of caustics are determined by the binary mass ratio , @xmath33 , and the separation between the binary components , @xmath17 , expressed in units of the einstein radius . as @xmath33 and @xmath17",
    "are slowly changed from the particular values given in table  1 , the isomagnification contours also change slightly , generally morphing into shapes that will yield significantly different light curves only when the values have been changed by more than about @xmath118 .    similarly , the source path does not need to fine - tuned to produce light curves with similar characteristics .",
    "light curves similar in their essentials ( e.g. , number and spacing of peaks , maximum magnification , etc . ) to each of the light curves we show could have been generated when a background source follows a somewhat different path behind the lens .",
    "the distance of closest approach could have been a bit smaller or larger and/or the angle of closest approach could have been somewhat different . in general , there is a set of paths that would have produced light curves similar to the one we are studying .",
    "the details of the new set of paths might be somewhat different in small ways , but the size of the range should be comparable . neither is fine tuning of the orbital phase required in order for the events to exhibit clear evidence of effects of rotation .",
    "the orbital phase becomes less relevant when the orbital period is short relative to the duration of the lensing event . as we will show in some of the examples in the next section",
    ", there is some difference between the cases in which the motion is prograde , versus retrograde . by prograde , we mean that the translational motion of the background source is along the same direction as the orbital motion . when the motion is retrograde , there are more opportunities for irregularities in the magnification pattern to rotate in front of the source path , increasing the effects of rotation on the light curve shape .    finally , as discussed below , the symmetries in the basic equations mean that it is possible to transform a particular system into a very different one that will produce identical or nearly identical light curves , although generally with a rescaling of the time .      to demonstrate that a range of very different physical systems can produce light curves almost identical to those that will be shown for the binaries listed in table  1 , we conducted a computational experiment",
    "specifically , to find binaries with similar values of @xmath62 , we generated a large number of binary lenses . because the shape of the light curve depends on the value of @xmath38 we selected only binaries with @xmath17 having values within @xmath119 of the value shown in table  1 .",
    "because the value of @xmath33 does nt influence the orbital period , we generated , in addition to @xmath38 only the relative transverse speed @xmath120 the total mass , @xmath12 the lens distance @xmath121 we considered the direction toward the galactic bulge , and used @xmath122  kpc .",
    "each point in figure [ all_sys ] represents a binary lens with @xmath17 chosen as described above and with the value of @xmath62 lying within @xmath18 of the value given for the corresponding system in table  1 . with values of both @xmath17 and @xmath62 very close to the values used in table  1",

    "the result is that a light curve with the same morphology can be produced by lenses having a wide range ( several orders of magnitude ) of total masses , of distances to the lens , orbital periods , and transverse speed .",

    "bright stars , whether they are high - mass stars on the main sequence or giants , produce fewer detectable events because they are will outshine most background stars they lens by several magnitudes . thus , the more massive stars likely to produce detectable events are stellar - mass bhs .",

    "nearby lenses are more amenable to direct detection .",
    "this can permit a wide range of post - event observations that provide more information about the binary .",
    "in addition , parallax effects are more likely to be detectable in the light curve , and should be included in the model fits .",
    "parallax provides information about the distance of the lens from us . on the other hand",
    ", distant lenses will be detectable only if they are bright and/or happen to be in less crowded fields .",
    "in addition , when the lens is more distant , finite - source - size effects are more likely to affect the light curve shape , especially when the lens is a binary whose light curve displays short - lived features . such effects can play two opposing roles in our study .",
    "if the source size is large compared to the binary features exhibited by the isomagnification contours , finite - source - size effects can diminish the effects of binarity in the light curve and wash out some of the short - lived deviations .",

    "such binaries are likely to be quite numerous .",

    "panel ( b ) shows the path of the source in the fixed frame of the binary .",
    "it appears to circle the binary center of mass clockwise , completing roughly two revolutions while the overall magnification remains above 1.05 .",
    "the spiraling source path insures that a much larger portion of the lensing plane is seen by the source . as a result",
    "there are many more strong features in the resulting lightcurve than can be expected for a typical binary lightcurve for which rotation does not play a large role .",
    "the repetitive nature of these features suggests the effects of orbital motion , and the standard lomb - scargle analysis of the lightcurve does identify the signal as periodic ( though the false signal probability is just over 2% , close to our threshold ) .",
    "the inferred period is 45days , close to the actual value of 42 days .",
    "because it increases the fraction of the magnification plane explored in each lensing event , orbital rotation significantly increases our chances of detecting binarity for large impact parameter events .",
    "figure [ sys1.lc ] ( a ) shows a sequence of lightcurves for four different impact parameters . even for a distant approach , @xmath160 , there is a hint of a periodicity in the three magnification bumps apparent in the lightcurve .",
    "this sequence also underscores the need for relative motion correction in determining the period via the timing analysis .",
    "the periodicity is very apparent in all of the curves , but it appears that the underlying period appears different for each one .",
    "a comparison between panels ( a ) and ( b ) in figure [ sys1.lc ] emphasize the importance of the direction of binary rotation with respect to the lens - source relative motion .",
    "the cartoons in the upper - right - hand corner in each panel illustrate our definitions of prograde and retrograde rotation ; note that the binary center - of - mass is assumed to be fixed , while the source moves past the binary . the retrograde motion ( panel a ) corresponds to the case when the companion closest to the projected position of the source moves opposite to the direction of source velocity .",
    "in this situation , the effects of binary rotation are amplified and the lightcurves show more peaks on average .",
    "the opposite is true for prograde rotation ( anel b ) , when the closest companion and the source move in the same direction , partially canceling the effects of rotation . as a result ,",

    "the specific lens system considered : a nearly solar - mass binary .",
    "* system 2 can represent a common type of binary in which both stars are on the main sequence .",
    "the mass ratio we chose is similar to the value at the peak of the observed distribution of binary mass ratios measured by duquennoy & mayor ( 1982 ) .",
    "the orbital separation is not unusual , although the observed distribution peaks at somewhat larger values .    alternatively , system 2 represents a binary in which one or both components have already evolved .",
    "in fact the smaller mass ( @xmath161 ) and the orbital period ( @xmath162  days ) satisfy the period / core - mass relationship ( rappaport et al .",
    "this relationship applies to a situation in which a giant star filled its roche lobe , transferring mass to a companion until the time at which the giant s stellar envelope was depleted . in this case , the depletion of the envelope left behind a helium wd with a mass of @xmath163 there are two possibilities .",
    "this core could be the remnant of the star that was initially the most massive . in this case",
    "the @xmath116 star is still on the main sequence .",
    "since it would have gained mass from the giant s envelope , it can be viewed as a `` blue straggler '' , with a larger mass than its initial mass . on the other hand",
    ", the core could be the remnant of the initially less - massive star . in this case",
    "the @xmath116 star has already evolved and is either a wd or a ns .",
    "the compact object is also likely to have gained mass from the giant that evolved to become the @xmath161 heium wd .",
    "if today s more massive star is a wd , then its mass is close to the chandrasekhar mass and it is a near - miss type ia supernova . if instead it is a neutron star , it may have been spun up by mass accretion and may therefore be a millisecond pulsar .",
    "thus , this single example , one of many that could have been chosen , illustrates that important classes of evolved stellar binaries can imprint signatures of rotation onto lensing light curves .    * the light curve : * the left - hand pane ; of figure  10 shows two light curves generated by this lens ; as",
    "before , the source is assumed to be located near the galactic center .",
    "the timescale ratio is @xmath164 , so the binary goes through many full rotations during the duration of the event .",
    "the resulting light curves have a highly periodic structure with the source returning over and over to roughly the same regions of the lens magnification plane .",
    "it is typical that the increasing numbers of features are associated with short orbital periods and small values of @xmath17 , so that the amplitude of the deviations is relatively small ( see figure [ lcperiods ] ) .",
    "it is easy to understand this by noting that the timescale ratio depends inversely on @xmath17 ( see eq . [ [ ratio ] ] ) . indeed , for this system @xmath165 , which is half of its value for the brown dwarf binary we discussed in the previous section .",
    "smaller @xmath17 implies that , over long time scales , the binary lensing features are less prominent , so overall the lightcurves look more like those due to single - mass lenses .",
    "unsurprisingly , the lomb - scargle analysis for both of the lightcurves shown in figure [ sys2.sys4](a ) extracts the orbital period with a discrepancy from the true orbital period smaller than @xmath166 , with a very high degree of confidence .",
    "since the timescale ratio is large , the corrections for the relative lens - source motion are not very important in this case .      *",

    "the light - curve deviations are regular but small in amplitude .",
    "a lomb - scargle test fails to pick up the orbital period in this case .",
    "this is mainly due to the low amplitude and small duration of the observed features ( in the context of our adopted once - per - day lightcurve sampling with 1% photometry errors ) , as well as the oscillatory behavior of the magnification within the features .",
    "however , an observation with sufficiently high cadence and sensitivity would allow the period to be measured directly , since the timescale ratio ( @xmath173 ) is large . merely folding the lightcurves",
    "to match the sharp peaks yields the period of 26days , very close to the true orbital period of 28days for this system .",
    "since the deviations in the isomagnification diagram are very asymmetric ( due to the very low mass ratio for this system ) , we expect roughly one deviation per orbit , as opposed to two expected when @xmath33 is of order unity .",
    "so the factor of 2 correction we routinely apply in our period analysis is not appropriate here .",
    "an interesting point to note is that this type of planet - induced deviation can be detected even when the distance of closest approach between the source and lens is large , and the peak source magnification is low .",
    "figure [ sys3](b ) shows the source path relative to the lens system .",

    "as was the case for system 3 , lomb - scargle analysis does not pick up a believable period here , but one can easily be seen with improved photometric sensitivity . again , as in system 3 , low value of the mass ratio makes the interpretation of the result difficult , since correcting by a factor of 2 only confuses the matter .",

    "we have shown that orbital motion produces significant phase shifts during gravitational lensing events for multiple lenses with wide ranges of parameters and distances from us .",

    "the reason may be that many of the expected deviations are difficult to identify .",
    "some light curves exhibiting rotational effects may be extreme enough that the event is not recognized as being due to lensing or else is difficult to fit . more often , the effects associated with orbital motion are subtle , and their discovery requires temporally dense , high - sensitivity sampling . since different fields are monitored in different ways , only about @xmath180 of the events being discovered at present receive monitoring that is adequate for these purposes",
    ". the detection efficiency may be low for many types of events ( penny et al .",
    "2011b ) .",
    "there are , however , some events for which the orbital - motion - detection efficiency should be close to unity : events caused by short period lenses .",
    "for example , if a neptune - mass or jupiter - mass planet orbits a solar - mass star at @xmath181 then even distances of closest approach as large as @xmath182 could produce distinctive , almost - periodic deviations ( distefano 2012 ) . these would occur during a stellar lens event that produces a peak magnification of only @xmath183 .",
    "the signatures of the planet could be easily missed without a filter that tests for intervals of periodicity in otherwise stable light curves .",
    "with such a filter , however , detection of the signature is guaranteed for a wide range of mass ratios and with sampling as good as the present - day sampling already applied in several fields today ( distefano 2012 ) .",
    "thus , if @xmath184 of all stars have planets ( a very conservative estimate ) , and if @xmath184 of these have nested planets , and if @xmath184 of these have planets with orbital separations between @xmath185 and @xmath186 , and if the mass ratios are larger than @xmath187 in @xmath188 of these cases , then roughly @xmath189 of lensing events by stars would exhibit small signatures of the planet s presence for approaches between @xmath190 and @xmath191 ; in many cases ( depending on the relative velocities ) , the signatures will repeat .",
    "a similar argument applies to binary systems , where orbital distributions are typically modeled as being uniform in logarithm over @xmath192 intervals .",
    "if @xmath184 of all stellar systems are binaries , and the @xmath193 of the stellar primaries have a companion in an orbit between @xmath185 and @xmath186 , this also suggests that @xmath189 of all stellar systems would have a significant probability of exhibiting orbital motion during lensing events .",
    "higher order multiples , which constitute @xmath194 of all stellar multiples are even more likely to have one companion in an orbit for which orbital motion can be detected .    if , therefore , signatures of orbital motion are detectable in only @xmath180 of events discovered today , we might expect @xmath195 of the @xmath196 events discovered per year to exhibit detectable evidence of orbital motion .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath197 events per year , half of them planet - lens events .",
    "in addition , orbital motion could be discovered in @xmath198 of the @xmath199 already - known events , @xmath200 of them associated with planet lenses . even if lower estimates of the population ( penny et al .",
    "2011a ) apply , the numbers would still be significant , and will become more so with the advent of programs such as _ kmtnet_. in addition , the excellent astrometric and photometric precision possible with space missions ( _ gaia _ , _ kepler , _ _ tess _ _ wfirst _ ) will make detailed studies of orbital motion a regular part of microlensing discoveries .",
    "finally , orbital motion will play an important role in the study of predicted gravitational lensing events .",
    "when the proper motion of a star within a few hundred parsecs has been measured , we can check whether it has a high probability of passing close enough to a background star to cause a lensing event ( see , e.g. , lpine & distefano 2012 , distefano et al .",
    "the equations in section  2 show that the einstein radii , @xmath46 , of nearby stars tend to be small .",
    "thus , if the orbital periods of planets orbiting these stars have a distribution similar to the distribution measured for the orbits of already - discovered exoplanets , we expect that , during lensing events , the orbital phase will shift significantly for close - orbit planets ( @xmath201 ) , and often for planets in the `` resonant '' zone ( @xmath202 ) , and in some cases even for planets in wider orbits .",
    "observing campaigns planned to monitor these predicted events will measure the masses of the central star and its planets , determine the orbital period(s ) , and provide constraints on the orbital inclination . for many of these systems",
    ", subsequent observations can verify the orbital properties and can be used to learn even more .",

    "<S> gravitational lensing events provide unique opportunities to discover and study planetary systems and binaries . here </S>",
    "<S> we build on previous work to explore the role that orbital motion can play in both identifying and learning more about multiple - mass systems that serve as gravitational lenses . </S>",
    "<S> we find that a significant fraction of planet - lens and binary - lens light curves are influenced by orbital motion . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the effects of orbital motion extend the range of binaries for which lens multiplicity can be discovered and studied . </S>",
    "<S> orbital motion will play an increasingly important role as observations with sensitive photometry , such as those made by the space missions _ kepler _ , _ transiting exoplanet survey satellite , ( tess ) _ , and _ wfirst _ discover gravitational lensing events . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the excellent astrometric measurements made possible by _ gaia _ will allow it to study the effects of orbital motion . </S>",
    "<S> frequent observations , such as those made possible with the _ korean microlensing telescope network _ , </S>",
    "<S> _ kmtnet _ will also facilitate the study of orbital motion during gravitational lensing events . </S>",
    "<S> finally , orbital motion will typically play a significant role in the characteristics of lensing events in which the passage of a specific nearby star in front of a background star can be predicted .    </S>",
