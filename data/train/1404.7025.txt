    "cohen and glashow  @xcite presented a powerful theoretical argument against the results in ref .",
    "their argument was based on the implication that these neutrinos would rapidly lose energy by the dominant energy loss channel of vacuum electron - positron pair emission ( vpe ) , i.e. , @xmath8 . eventually , the results in ref .  @xcite were retracted  @xcite .",

    "the ice cube collaboration has recently reported the observation of 37 extraterrestrial neutrinos with energy above @xmath9 60 tev , giving a cosmic neutrino signal @xmath10 above the atmospheric background  @xcite .",
    "this is significant evidence for a neutrino flux of cosmic origin , above that produced by atmospheric cosmic - ray secondaries  @xcite.the very existence of pev neutrinos has been used to place strong constraints on liv in the neutrino sector  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "there are four indications that the cosmic neutrinos observed by icecube are extragalactic in origin  @xcite : ( 1 ) the celestial distribution of the 37 reported cosmic events is consistent with isotropy , with no significant enhancement in the galactic plane  @xcite , although it has been argued that a subset of these events might be of galactic origin  @xcite.(2 ) a possible cutoff in the energy spectrum of these neutrinos may be indicative of photopion production followed by pion decay  @xcite such as expected in agn cores  @xcite , grbs  @xcite , or intergalactic interactions  @xcite .",

    "( 3 ) the diffuse galactic neutrino flux  @xcite is expected to be well below that observed by ice cube . ( 4 ) at least one of the @xmath91 pev neutrinos observed by icecube ( dubbed `` ernie '' ) came from a direction off of the galactic plane .",
    "an upper limit for the difference between putative superluminal neutrino and electron velocities of @xmath11 was previously derived by one of us , confirming that the observed pev neutrinos could have reached earth from extragalactic sources . after obtaining an upper limit on the superluminal electron velocity of @xmath12 ,",
    "an upper limit of @xmath13 was derived from one of the @xmath9pev neutrino events  @xcite .",
    "( here @xmath14 and @xmath15 in the standard model extension ( sme ) effective field theory framework for describing the effects of liv and cpt violation  @xcite ) .",
    "this previous limit allows for the possibility that minimally superluminal neutrinos can propagate over large distances from extragalactic sources such as active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and @xmath16-ray bursts ( grb ) , while undergoing energy losses by vpe .",
    "given that neutrinos detected by icecube are extragalactic , cosmological effects should be taken into account in deriving new liv constraints .",
    "the reasons are straightforward .",
    "as opposed to the extinction of high energy extragalactic photons through electromagnetic interactions  @xcite , neutrinos survive from all redshifts because they only interact weakly .",
    "we thus consider here a scenario where the neutrino sources have a redshift distribution that follows that of the star formation rate  @xcite ( see figure  [ sfr ] ) , as appears to be roughly the case for both active galactic nuclei and @xmath16-ray bursts .",
    "since the universe is transparent to neutrinos , most of the cosmic pev neutrinos will come from sources at redshifts between @xmath90.5 and @xmath92  @xcite .",
    "therefore neither energy losses by redshifting of neutrinos nor the cosmological @xmath17cdm redshift - distance relation can be neglected in our calculations .",
    "we again note the definitions @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the @xmath20 s here are to be understood to be the maximum attainable velocities of the neutrinos and electrons respectively .",

    "we adopt the mean fractional energy loss due to a single pair emission of @xmath9 0.78 from  @xcite .",
    "we assume for this calculation a flat @xmath17cdm universe with a hubble constant of h@xmath31 = 67.8 km s@xmath30 mpc@xmath30 , taking @xmath32 = 0.7 and @xmath33 = 0.3 .",
    "therefore , the energy loss owing to redshifting for a @xmath17cdm universe is given by @xmath34",
    "in order to determine the effect of vpe on putative superluminal neutrinos propagating from cosmological distances we explore a simple example using monte carlo techniques to take account of energy losses by both vpe and redshifting .",
    "we consider a scenario where the neutrino sources have a redshift distribution that follows that of the star formation rate  @xcite , as appears to be roughly the case for active galactic nuclei and @xmath16-ray bursts .",
    "we assume a source spectrum proportional to @xmath35 between 100 tev and 100 pev .",
    "we generate 50 million events using these two distributions .",
    "our final results are normalized to an energy flux of @xmath36 , as is consistent with the icecube data for both the southern and northern hemisphere for energies between 60 tev and 2 pev , particularly when atmospheric charm decay neutrinos  @xcite are included in the background subtraction  @xcite . in our monte carlo",
    "runs we consider threshold energies between 1 pev and 40 pev for the vpe process , corresponding to values of @xmath37 between @xmath38 . by propagating our test neutrinos including energy losses from both vpe and redshifting using a monte carlo code ,",

    "they are consistent with a spectrum given by @xmath39 up to an energy of @xmath92 pev , the energy of the so - called `` big bird '' event .",
    "no neutrino induced events have been seen above 2 pev .",
    "@xcite    icecube has not detected any neutrino induced events from the glashow resonance effect . in this effect ,",
    "electrons in the icecube volume provide enhanced target cross sections for electron antineutrinos through the @xmath40 resonance channel , @xmath41 , at the resonance energy @xmath42 pev  @xcite .",
    "this enhancement leads to an increased icecube effective area for detecting the sum of the @xmath43 s , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath43 s plus @xmath44 s by a factor of @xmath45  @xcite .",
    "it is usually expected that 1/3 of the potential 6.3 pev neutrinos would be @xmath43 s plus @xmath44 s unless new physics is involved  @xcite .",
    "thus , the enhancement in the overall effective area expected is a factor of @xmath93 . taking account of the increased effective area between 2 and 6 pev and a decrease from an assumed neutrino energy spectrum of @xmath46",
    ", we would expect about 3 events at the glashow resonance provided that the number of @xmath44 s is equal to the number of @xmath43 s . even without considering the glashow resonance effect , several neutrino events above 2 pev",
    "would be expected if the @xmath46 spectrum extended to higher energies .",
    "thus , the lack of neutrinos above 2 pev energy and at the 6.3 pev resonance may be indications of a cutoff in the neutrino spectrum .",
    "hopefully , the acquisition of more data will clarify this point . in the next section we consider the physics implications of both the cutoff and no - cutoff scenarios for the neutrino spectra .",

    "curves from left to right are spectra obtained with rest - frame threshold energies of 1 , 2 , 4 , 10 , 20 and 40 pev .",
    "the corresponding values of @xmath37 are given by equation ( [ spectra]).,title=\"fig : \" ]    the results of our calculations show that there is a high - energy drop off in the propagated neutrino spectrum resulting from the opening of the vpe channel above threshold .",
    "furthermore , the redshifting effect pushes the cutoff in the energy spectrum below the non - redshifted rest - frame threshold energy . as discussed before , we assume that the neutrino production rate follows the star formation rate in redshift space .",
    "this rate peaks at a redshift between 1 and 2 .",
    "the neutrinos emitted during this past era of enhanced stellar and galactic activity are then redshifted by a factor of 2 to 3 . the redshifting effect dominates the shape of the resulting spectra regardless of threshold energy .",
    "this is because the mean propagation time is very short compared with the total travel time with the exception of rest - energy thresholds greater than 10 pev as follows from equations ( [ threshold ] ) - ( [ redshift ] ) ( see table  [ proptable ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the mean propagation time is also short for _ all _ energies greater than the threshold , with the exception of only those very near threshold , as illustrated in figure [ proptime ] for a rest - energy threshold of 10 pev . in the case of rest - energy thresholds",
    "greater than 10 pev , the particles very near threshold will simply redshift below it without decay .",
    "this has little impact on their final observed energies at @xmath47 .",
    "our calculated neutrino spectra follow our assumed @xmath35 power - law form below @xmath90.2 of the the redshifted vpe threshold , have a small pileup effect up to the redshifted threshold energy , and have a sharp high energy cutoff at higher energies , as shown in figure  [ spectra ] .",
    "the pileup is caused by the propagation of the higher energy neutrinos in energy space down to energies within a factor of @xmath95 below the threshold .",
    "this is indicative the fact that fractional energy loss from the last allowed neutrino decay before the vpe process ceases is 0.78  @xcite .",
    "the pileup effect is similar to that of energy propagation for ultrahigh energy protons near the gzk threshold  @xcite .",
    "our results yield the best constraints liv in the neutrino sector to date , _ viz .",
    "_ , @xmath48 .",
    "this is because our results for our rest - frame threshold energy cases below 10 pev as shown in figure  [ spectra ] are inconsistent with the icecube data .",
    "our result for a 10 pev non - redshifted threshold , corresponding to @xmath49 , is just consistent with the icecube results , giving a cutoff effect above 2 pev .",
    "we note that the present best upper limit on @xmath50 is @xmath51  @xcite .",
    "thus for the conservative case of no - liv effect , _",
    "e.g. _ , if one assumes a cutoff in the intrinsic neutrino spectrum of the sources or one assumes a steeper assumed pev neutrino spectrum proportional to @xmath52  @xcite , we find the new constraint on superluminal neutrino velocity , @xmath53 .",
    "however , the steeper spectrum scenario has been placed into question  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , for an @xmath46 power - law neutrino spectrum , we find the possibility that the apparent cutoff in the observed spectrum above @xmath92 pev can conceivably be an effect of lorentz invariance violation ( see figure  [ spectra ] ) .",
    "( another suggestion involving liv effects of _ subluminal _ neutrinos has recently been discussed  @xcite ) .",
    "a hard @xmath46 spectrum has been proposed to be produced in starburst galaxies  @xcite .",
    "the icecube flux is below the upper limit of @xmath54 obtained by one of us for the neutrino flux from starburst galaxies  @xcite , allowing for this possibility .",
    "the power - law source spectrum option opens the possibility that a high energy cutoff in such a hard @xmath46 power - law neutrino spectrum could be caused by a small violation of lorentz invariance , with neutrinos being very slightly superluminal , with @xmath6 being @xmath7 , taking @xmath55 .",
    "as has been pointed out previously for ultrahigh energy neutrinos  @xcite , one test for the cutoff scenario would be the non - observation of the `` cosmogenic '' neutrinos from photopion production interactions of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays with the cosmic background radiation  @xcite , since all cosmological neutrinos above @xmath92 pev would be affected by the vpe process .",
    "such a non - observation would have implications for @xmath16-ray constraints on ultrahigh energy cosmic ray origin and composition models , perhaps implying the ultrahigh energy cosmic rays are mainly heavy nuclei  @xcite .",
