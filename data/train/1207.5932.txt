    "sporadic energy releases on the sun can accelarate solar energetic particles ( sep ) in the corona and interplanetary medium . such phenomena often lead to solar particle events ( spes ) observed at earth , that is an important factor of solar - terrestrial relation , and specifically space weather @xcite .",
    "a typical quantity for a spe is the fluence of sep with energy above 30 mev , @xmath18 .",
    "we have sufficient knowledge of spes over the space era since mid-1950s @xcite , with only several events with @xmath19 @xmath2 and hundreds of weaker spes observed .",

    "such a study is possible only using indirect proxy data .",
    "some estimates have been obtained from the measurements of cosmogenic isotopes lunar rocks @xcite but it gives only the average flux of sep over very long scale without extracting individual spes .",

    "cosmogenic nuclide @xmath3c and @xmath4be data measured in terrestrial archives may provide information on spe in the past @xcite but this possibility was not fully explored earlier .",
    "accordingly , the probability of extreme spes remained grossly uncertain @xcite .    here",
    "we establish a solid observational constraint on the distribution of extreme spes using presently available datasets of cosmogenic isotopes ( @xmath3c and @xmath4be ) measured in terrestrial archives with sufficient time resolution and quality , and modern models of their production in the atmosphere .",

    "as the reference event , we considered an extreme spe of 23-feb-1956 ( spe56 ) @xcite with a very hard spectrum @xcite . while spe56 was the strongest observed ground - level enhancement ( gle ) , @xmath22% in the count rate of the leeds nm , it had relatively modest fluence @xmath23 @xmath2 @xcite",

    "since cosmogenic isotopes are produced by the most energetic part of the sep energy spectra ( @xmath25 gev ) , we consider here the spe56 scenario .",
    "response of @xmath4be to spes was calculated similar to @xcite but using an updated @xmath4be yield function @xcite , the corresponding geomagnetic model , and an intermediate atmospheric mixing model ( polar tropospheric and hemispherical stratospheric mixing  see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the calculated @xmath4be production is @xmath26 atoms/@xmath17 for the spe56 scenario . because of the @xmath4be stratospheric residence time @xcite , a possible spe peak in @xmath4be data can be 23-yr long .",
    "since present models can not convert the @xmath4be production into concentrations in ice , they are typically assumed to be directly proportional to each other ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "for the normalization we use the reference period 18501900 ad with moderate solar activity : the galactic cosmic ray ( gcr ) modulation potential 443 mv @xcite was close to the mean holocene value @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the reference period @xmath4be production is @xmath27 at/@xmath28/sec , or @xmath29 at/@xmath17/year .",
    "this value is scaled to the mean measured concentration for the reference period , in each ice core ( 1.025 , 1.86 , 3.47 and 2.76 @xmath30 at / g for _ dye3 , ngrip , sp _ and _ df _ series , respectively ) .",
    "the _ grip _",
    "series was normalized to the entire interval .",
    "the expected radiocarbon response of @xmath21c was calculated in two steps .",
    "first , the global production @xmath31 was computed using a new production model @xcite , yielding @xmath32 at/@xmath17 for spe56 .",
    "next , the instant atmospheric injection of @xmath3c ( @xmath31 ) was passed through a 5-box carbon cycle model @xcite , and the tropospheric @xmath21c was calculated .",

    "accordingly , we look for a signature like that in the @xmath21c data .",
    "the spe56 peak in the annual ( 5-year ) @xmath21c data is 0.35 ( @xmath33 ) permille , viz . below measurement errors of @xmath34 permille",
    "therefore , an spe needs to be a factor @xmath35 greater than spe56 to be observable in the radiocarbon data .",
    "an spe72-type soft event would require a 40-fold greater @xmath18 , with respect to spe56 , to produce the same amount of cosmogenic isotopes .",
    "accordingly , the estimates obtained with the reference spe56 spectrum should be 40-fold enhanced to correspond to a soft - spectrum spe72 scenario .",
    "first we analyze data series with the annual resolution ( b  d in section  [ sec : data ] ) , looking for potential signatures of spes .    for the _ ngrip _ series we looked for peaks with the magnitude @xmath36 at / g and duration @xmath37 years .",

    "@xmath3c series yields many candidates ( see an example in fig .  [",
    "fig : ad780]a ) .",

    "about half of the candidates in the intcal09 series after 7000 bc are rejected basing on the @xmath4be data .",
    "therefore , half of the identified candidates before 7000 bc can also be spurious .",
    "finally , we list the candidates passing the cross - check , in table  [ tab : spe_1 ] .",

    "we assume here that it is a spe signature and evaluate its parameters .",

    "sp _ peak apparently contradicts the data .",
    "thus , while all the analyzed datasets are consistent with a hypothesis of a strong spe ca .",
    "1460 ad , its fluence is likely about @xmath11 protons/@xmath17 for the spe56 scenario .",
    "the very high fluence implied by the _",

    "another interesting candidate for a strong spe is ca .",
    "780 ad as manifested through distinct peaks in _ df _ , _ intcal09 _ and _ m12 _ data series ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ad780 ] ) . according to these data - sets , the event was 2550 times stronger than spe56 with the fluence @xmath48 protons/@xmath17 .",
    "the best fit for the _ intcal09 _ data ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ad780]a ) is obtained for a @xmath49 event started ca .",
    "the _ m12 _ data ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ad780]b ) is better fit with a @xmath50 event started in 775 ad , while the _ df _ data ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ad780]c ) is consistent with @xmath51 event occurred between 780 and 790 ad",
    ". however , the _ grip _ series ( fig .  [ fig : ad780]d ) depicts no peak at that period , which indicates that the fluence greater than @xmath52 protons/@xmath17 is inconsistent at 0.03 significance level .",
    "applying the cross - check , we found that the fluence implied by the _ intcal09 _ data ( @xmath49  see table  [ tab : spe_1 ] ) is consistent with the _ grip _ data , while both @xmath50 and 45 based on the _ df _ and _ m12 _ data , respectively , yield a too high peak in the _ grip _ series .",
    "accordingly , we conclude that the event of 780 ad is a possible candidate for a strong spe with a consensus value @xmath53 protons/@xmath17 .",
    "the carrington event of 1859 ad is often considered as an extreme spe , with @xmath54 @xmath2 as estimated from the nitrate record in the greenland summit core @xcite . although none of the series analyzed here depicts a peak around 1859 , we check if this proposed spe is consistent with the cosmogenic data . using the gcr modulation reconstruction @xcite and the @xmath4be production model @xcite , we calculated the expected @xmath4be concentration along with the additional production for 1859 ad , applying sep parameters for the carrington spe according to section 8 of @xcite .",
    "the model computation is then confronted with the annual data of two greenland series , _ ngrip _ and _ dye3 _ , in fig .",
    "[ fig:1859 ] .",
    "the @xmath4be peak , expected from the nitrate data , is too strong , contradicting to the observed data in two greenland sites .",
    "radiocarbon data and decadal @xmath4be series can not resolve the carrington peak .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the cosmogenic data do not support the hypothesis of a very strong spe related to the carrington flare .",
    "we propose , by analyzing data from different cosmogenic isotope records and performing their cross - check , a list of candidates for strong spes in the past ( table  [ tab : spe_1 ] ) .",
    "the list is somewhat uncertain , as some events may be missing or some spurious peaks falsely identified .",
    "however , the result is quite consistent in a statistical sense .    four candidates with the @xmath55 factor 10@xmath1015",
    "are identified in the annual @xmath4be series _ ngrip _ and _ dye3 _ for the last 600 years ( first block of table  [ tab : spe_1 ] ) .",
    "events with @xmath56 can not be reliably identified .",
    "we can also securely say that events with @xmath57 are not observed during that period ( cf .",
    "[ fig:1859 ] ) .",
    "in particular , a strong spe related to the carrington flare in 1859 contradicts these data .",
    "we evaluate the probability @xmath58 of occurrence of such events , applying the poisson distribution ( assuming that spes are mutually independent ) .",
    "for example , for four events observed during 600 years , the probability is @xmath59 year@xmath15 ( 90% confidence interval ) , which is higher than the naively taken @xmath60 year@xmath15 . if no event with @xmath6 @xmath2 is observed over 600 years , the corresponding one - sided 90% confidence interval is @xmath61 year@xmath15 , with the median probability 0.0012 year@xmath15 ( once per 850 years ) .",
    "the last 46 centuries cover the full range of solar activity , from grand minima to the maximum @xcite serving as an archetype of the solar variability .",
    "therefore we expect that this result is consistent with longer scales . on the multi - millennial scale ( the holocene",
    " 11 millennia ) , 19 candidates are identified ( second block in table  [ tab : spe_1 ] ) with @xmath62 . a few candidates with @xmath63",
    "were rejected by the cross - check .",
    "this gives the average occurrence rate of such spes roughly two per millennium .",
    "moreover , we can securely say that during the holocene there was no events with @xmath64 , placing a strong upper limit on the spe strength .",
    "we found no apparent relation of the spe candidates occurrence and the solar activity level @xcite .",
    "we summarize our findings in a plot ( fig .",
    "[ fig : d_all ] ) of the integral probability of strong spe occurrence .",
    "x- and y - axis give the @xmath18 fluence and the probability of occurrence of spe with the @xmath0 mev proton annual fluence exceeding @xmath18 , for different datasets .",
    "the measured annual fluences for the space era ( 19562008 ) are shown by open triangles ( * ? ? ?",
    "* shea , private communication 2012 ) .",
    "since the space era coincides with the unusually active sun @xcite , this probabilities may be higher than for the typical medium activity sun .",
    "the black triangle reflects the fact that no spe with @xmath20 @xmath2 was observed during 53 years .",
    "the open star corresponds to the four spe candidates from the annual @xmath4be data ( first block in table  [ tab : spe_1 ] ) , while the filled star corresponds to no spe with @xmath6 @xmath2 found during 600 years .",
    "open circles represent the candidates found in the rougher time series ( second block in table  [ tab : spe_1 ] ) , grouped into four points @xmath65 , 1.5 , 2 and 2.5 @xmath11 @xmath2 , respectively . since the lower fluence value is probably underestimated because of the detection threshold , we ignore the first open circle , using instead the star - symbolled point from the annual @xmath4be datasets . the filled circle corresponds to no event with @xmath8 @xmath2 found over 11 millennia .",
    "one can see that there is a break in the distribution at about @xmath66 @xmath2 .",
    "this break ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may be related to a streaming limit @xcite and/or limitations in the energetics of solar flares / cme @xcite .",
    "our new results put a stronger constraint on the distribution .",
    "for example , a spe @xmath57 is expected only once per millennium , and no @xmath63 event is expected over tens of millennia .",
    "we try to fit the tail of the distribution ( @xmath67 @xmath2 ) by two simple models : exponential ( @xmath68 ) and power law ( @xmath69 )  see grey lines in the figure .",
    "the data does not allow us to distinguish between the two shapes .",
    "we also compare our results with the average sep flux over time scales of thousands  millions years , estimated from lunar rocks , which ranges 21@xmath1056 ( @xmath17 sec)@xmath15 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "time averaging of the results from fig .",
    "[ fig : d_all ] using the above fits for the tail yields the average flux @xmath70 ( @xmath17 sec)@xmath15 , which is composed of about 35 ( @xmath17 sec)@xmath15 for the space era record ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with an addition of 3.2 ( @xmath17 sec)@xmath15 due to the distribution tail based on cosmogenic isotope data ( both exponent and power law give similar results ) , suggesting that extreme spes contribute only about 10% to the total sep fluence .",
    "this is totally consistent with the assessments based on lunar rocks , giving an independent support to the present results . for a spe with a softer energy spectrum , like spe72",
    ", the tail addition would be 40-times greater ( section  [ sec : model ] ) leading to the average sep flux @xmath71150 ( @xmath17 sec)@xmath15 , in contradiction with the lunar rock data .",
