    "<S> the concept of complex systems has become a new paradigm for the search of mechanisms and a unified interpretation of the processes of emergence of structures , organization and functionality in a variety of natural and artificial phenomena in different contexts [ badii & politi , 1997 ; mikhailov & calenbuhr , 2002 ; kaneko & tsuda , 2000 ] . </S>",
    "<S> one common criterion for defining complexity is the emergent behavior : collective structures , patterns and functions that are absent at the local level arise from simple interaction rules between the constitutive elements in a system . phenomena such as the spontaneous formation of structures , organization , spatial patterns , chaos synchronization , collective oscillations , spiral waves , segregation and differentiation , formation and growth of domains , and social consensus , are examples of self - organizing processes that occur in various contexts such as physical , chemical , biological , physiological , social and economic systems .    </S>",

    "<S> nontrivial collective behavior is characterized by a well defined evolution of macroscopic quantities coexisting with local chaos . </S>",
    "<S> models based on coupled map networks have been widely used in the investigation of collective phenomena that appear in many complex systems [ kaneko & tsuda , 2000 ] . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , networks of coupled chaotic maps can exhibit nontrivial collective behavior .    </S>",
    "<S> a paradigmatic example of a complex system is provided by the human brain . </S>",
    "<S> it consists of a highly interconnected network of millions of neurons . </S>",
    "<S> the local dynamics of a neuron in general behaves as a non - linear excitable element [ herz _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ , 2006 ] . </S>",
    "<S> from the signal of a single neuron it is not possible to understand the highly structured collective behavior and functions of the brain .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the relative complexity of the human brain by considering the collective dynamics that arise from the local dynamics of groups of neurons , as manifested in electroencephalographic ( eeg ) signals . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate a measure of complexity from the global dynamics of eeg signals from healthy subjects and epileptic patients , and are able to establish a criterion to characterize the collective behavior in both groups of individuals . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the collective dynamics of eeg signals possess relative higher values of complexity for healthy subjects in comparison to that for epileptic patients . </S>",
    "<S> our results support the view that epilepsy is characterized by a loss of complexity in the brain , as indicated by measurements of the dimension correlation [ babloyantz a. & destexhe a. , 1986 ] , algorithmic complexity [ rapp _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ , 1994 ] , and anticipation of seizures [ martinerie _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ , 1998 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> in order to interpret our results , we propose a model of coupled chaotic maps where we calculate the measure of complexity as a function of a parameter and relate this measure with the emergence of nontrivial collective behavior in the system . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that the appearance of nontrivial collective behavior is associated to high values of complexity ; thus suggesting that similar dynamical collective process may take place in the human brain .    </S>",
    "<S> several measures of complexity have been proposed in the literature . here </S>",
    "<S> we employ the concept of statistical complexity , introduced by lopez - ruiz _ et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> [ 1995 ] . </S>",
    "<S> this quantity is based on the statistical description of a system at a given scale , and it has been shown to be capable of discerning among different macroscopic structures emerging in complex systems [ snchez & lopez - ruiz , 2005 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the amount of complexity @xmath0 is obtained by computing the product between the entropy @xmath1 , and a sort of distance to the equipartition state in the system , named the disequilibrium @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the statistical complexity is defined as [ lopez - ruiz _ et al . _ , </S>",
    "<S> 1995 ] @xmath3 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are , respectively , the entropy and the disequilibrium ; @xmath4 represents the probability associated to the state @xmath5 ; @xmath6 is the number of states , and @xmath7 is a positive normalization constant . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath4 may vary for different levels of observation , reflected in @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the quantity @xmath0 can quantify relative values of complexity in a specific system at a given level of description .    </S>",
    "<S> the eeg data base used in this study consists of records from @xmath8 individuals in an age range between @xmath9 and @xmath10 years old . </S>",
    "<S> these individuals are classified into four groups : ( i ) a group of @xmath11 healthy subjects ; ( ii ) a group of @xmath11 epileptic patients receiving treatment with phenobarbital for at least @xmath12 months ; ( iii ) a group consisting of @xmath12 epileptic patients that have not yet received medical treatment ; and ( iv ) a group of @xmath13 epileptic patients who experienced spontaneous seizures during the eeg recording . </S>",
    "<S> all the epileptic patients in the data base were diagnosed generalized epilepsy manifested through tonic - clonic seizures .    </S>",
    "<S> the record of the eeg signal from each individual was carried out over @xmath14 channels connected to scalp electrodes according to the international @xmath15 system [ jasper , 1958 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the potentials were measured with respect to a reference level consisting of both ears short - circuited . </S>",
    "<S> the signal was digitalized at a sampling frequency of @xmath16  hz and a / d conversion of @xmath17 bits , and filtered to bandwidth between @xmath18 and @xmath19  hz . </S>",
    "<S> all the eeg signals were recorded with the individuals at rest and with eyes closed , during a one - hour period , between @xmath20  a.m. and @xmath11  a.m. we consider continuous segments of the eeg signals containing between @xmath21 to @xmath22 points , with no significant artifacts .    </S>",
    "<S> a channel in the eeg signal represents an average of a set of neurons in an specific part of the brain . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath14 channels in each eeg can be considered as simultaneous time series coming from different parts of an interacting dynamical network . </S>",
    "<S> the collective behavior of such a dynamical network at a given time @xmath23 can be described by , the instantaneous mean field @xmath24 , defined as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the real value registered by electrode @xmath27 at discrete time @xmath23 , @xmath28 ; and @xmath29 is the number of electrodes .    </S>",
    "<S> the probability distribution of the mean field values corresponding to a given eeg signal is constructed from the time series of @xmath24 calculated for that signal . </S>",
    "<S> we define the number of states @xmath6 as a partition consisting of @xmath6 equal size segments on the range of values of @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> next , the probability @xmath4 associated to the @xmath5 state is calculated . here </S>",
    "<S> we set @xmath30 for all the eeg signals . </S>",
    "<S> then , eq .  ( [ complexityeq ] ) </S>",
    "<S> is used to calculate the statistical complexity @xmath0 associated to the mean field for each eeg .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ meanfieldeegfig ] shows the statistical complexity of the mean field of the eeg signal for all the individuals in each group from the data base . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ meanfieldeegfig ] indicates that the complexity measure for the global dynamics of the eeg signal is higher in healthy subjects ( group i ) in relation to that of epileptic patients ( groups ii , iii , and iv ) . </S>",
    "<S> the lowest levels of complexity correspond to the patients undergoing epileptic seizures ( group iv ) . </S>",
    "<S> this measure of complexity allows us to discern between healthy subjects and epileptic patients . among eeg signals from epileptic patients , </S>",
    "<S> those signals from patients under treatment seem to possess slightly greater complexity than those from patients without treatment . </S>",
    "<S> however , the quantity @xmath0 is not very efficient for distinguishing between the different groups of epileptic patients . </S>",
    "<S> the spread of the values of the complexity found in group i indicates a greater variability in the statistical properties of eeg signals from the healthy subjects .        </S>",
    "<S> it is important to say that other choices for the partition of states of the eeg signal are possible , and hence different values for the @xmath1 and @xmath2 measures can be obtained , without affecting the overall behavior of the statistical quantity @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , rosso _ et al . _ [ 2003 ] divided the time axis of eeg signals into non - overlapping temporal windows on which the wavelet energy at different resolution levels can be calculated .    in order to give an interpretation to the above results , we propose a dynamical model . </S>",
    "<S> we consider a system of @xmath31 interacting nonlinear , heterogeneous elements forming a network , where the state of element @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) at time @xmath23 is denoted by @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of the state of each element is assumed to depend on its own local dynamics and on its interaction with the network , whose intensity is described by the coupling parameter @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> then , we consider a network of maps subjected to a global interaction as follows [ cisneros _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ , 2002 ] @xmath36 where the function @xmath37 describes the local dynamics of map @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> the usual homogeneous globally coupled map system [ kaneko , 1990 ] corresponds to having the same local function for all the elements , i.e. , @xmath38 . as local chaotic dynamics we choose the logarithmic map @xmath39 , @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is a real parameter . </S>",
    "<S> this map does not belong to the standard class of universality of unimodal or bounded maps . </S>",
    "<S> robust chaos occurs in the parameter interval @xmath42 $ ] , with no periodic windows and no separated chaotic bands on this interval [ kawabe & kondo , 1991 ] . </S>",
    "<S> heterogeneity in the maps is introduced by considering @xmath43 , where the values @xmath44 are uniformly distributed at random in the interval @xmath45 $ ] .    as the macroscopic variable for this system , we consider the instantaneous mean field defined as @xmath46     as a function of @xmath35 for a coupled heterogeneous map network , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ meanfieldeq ] ) , with @xmath47 $ ] and @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) bifurcation diagram of a local map @xmath34 versus @xmath35 , exposing the underlying chaotic dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) complexity @xmath0 as a function of @xmath35 . ]    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ systemfig](a ) shows the bifurcation diagram of the mean field @xmath24 of the globally coupled heterogeneous map network , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ systemeq ] ) , with @xmath49 $ ] and @xmath48 , as a function of the coupling strength @xmath35 . for each value of @xmath35 , </S>",
    "<S> the mean field was calculated at each time step during a run of @xmath50 iterates starting from random initial conditions on the local maps , uniformly distributed on the interval @xmath51 $ ] , after discarding @xmath52 transients . </S>",
    "<S> the local maps are chaotic and desynchronized ( see fig.2(b ) ) . however , the mean field in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) reveals the existence of global periodic attractors for some intervals of the coupling parameter . </S>",
    "<S> this is the phenomenon of nontrivial collective behavior where macroscopic order coexists with local disorder in a system of interacting dynamical elements . </S>",
    "<S> different collective states emerge as a function of the coupling @xmath35 . in this representation , </S>",
    "<S> collective periodic states at a given value of the coupling appear as sets of vertical segments which correspond to intrinsic fluctuations of the periodic orbits of the mean field . increasing the system size @xmath31 does not decrease the amplitude of the collective periodic orbits . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , when @xmath31 is increased the widths of the segments that make a periodic orbit in the bifurcation diagrams such as in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) shrink , indicating that the global periodic attractors become better defined in the large system limit .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ systemfig](c ) shows the complexity @xmath0 of the mean field as a function of @xmath35 . here </S>",
    "<S> , the observation level was set at @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> when the value of @xmath35 is small , the bifurcation diagram of @xmath24 shows a period - one collective attractor , which implies that for this parameter range the system follows the standard statistical behavior of uncorrelated disordered variables that yield a single period for its mean field . at the chosen level of resolution , the complexity measure considers the macroscopical variable as laying in a single state , thus giving @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> the complexity @xmath0 remains zero up to a critical value of the coupling @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> the onset of the complexity at the value @xmath56 resembles a first order phase transition . as the periodicity of the collective orbit increases , </S>",
    "<S> more states are occupied by the probability distribution of the mean field @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> the probability distribution of @xmath24 corresponding to a periodic collective state is not uniform and consists of a set of distinct `` humps '' . </S>",
    "<S> a nonuniform probability distribution and few occupied states lead to larger values of the complexity @xmath0 , as observed for the period - two collective orbit . </S>",
    "<S> when the system enters chaotic collective motion , more states are occupied by the probability distribution of the mean field and therefore this probability becomes more uniform . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> the complexity decreases .    the emergence of ordered collective behavior in the coupled map network , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ systemeq ] ) , can not be attributed to the existence of windows of periodicity nor to chaotic band splitting in the local dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ systemfig ] shows that higher values of complexity are associated to the occurrence of nontrivial collective behavior in a network of interacting dynamical elements . </S>",
    "<S> we have obtained similar results for different network topologies and different local map dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> this result adds support to the concept of complexity as an emergent behavior ; in this case the ordered collective behavior is not present at the local level . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , these results suggest that similar dynamical collective processes may take place in the human brain . from the dynamics of a single neuron as an excitable element it is not possible in general to characterize the collective behavior of the brain , as the collective behavior of the coupled map network can not be inferred from the knowledge of the dynamics of a single map . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the lower values of complexity found in the global dynamics of the eeg signals from epileptic patients may be associated to a decrease in the ability to generate collective organization and functions in the brain affected by such physiological condition .    </S>",
    "<S> as we have mentioned , the measure of the statistical complexity depends on the level of observation ( number of states @xmath6 ) considered for the computations . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ numberstatesfig](a ) shows the statistical complexity as a function of the number of states for the mean field value from an eeg signal of a healthy subject . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ numberstatesfig](b ) a similar plot of @xmath24 is shown for the value of the coupling parameter @xmath57 in the coupled heterogeneous map network , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ systemeq ] ) .     as a function of @xmath6 for the mean field from eeg signals for a healthy subject . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) @xmath0 as a function of @xmath6 for the coupled heterogeneous map network , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ systemeq ] ) , @xmath57 . ]    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ numberstatesfig ] shows that the measures of the complexity in both systems tend to constant , asymptotic values when the number of states @xmath6 is increased . for the coupled map network , </S>",
    "<S> the number of states used in the computations was @xmath53 , while for the eeg signals we employed @xmath58 ; these values lie in the corresponding asymptotic regime for each system .    in the heterogeneous coupled maps network </S>",
    "<S> , the size of the system @xmath31 can be related to the minimum number of states or level of description @xmath59 that should be used in the calculation of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the width of a vertical segment in the bifurcation diagram of @xmath24 at the level of description @xmath59 is given by @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we have observed that this width is proportional to the statistical dispersion of the points inside the segment , which in turn decreases with the size of the system following the law of large numbers as @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> then , @xmath62 thus , for a given system size @xmath31 , it is possible to estimate the minimum number of states that should be considered for the computation of the statistical complexity in this system . </S>",
    "<S> correspondingly , for the resolution level @xmath53 that we employed in fig .  [ systemfig ] , the minimum system size that could have been used is @xmath63 .    in summary , we have shown that the measure of statistical complexity eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ complexityeq ] ) used in this work is useful in the analysis of theoretical and real systems . </S>",
    "<S> there exists a morphological difference between the global dynamics in eeg signals from healthy subjects and those from epileptic patients that can be revealed by employing this tool . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations show that epilepsy is associated to a low level of statistical complexity .    </S>",
    "<S> we have also shown that the mean field of a network of heterogeneous chaotic maps contains relevant information about the complexity of the system which can not be derived from the knowledge of the behavior of the local maps . a high degree of complexity </S>",
    "<S> is associated to the emergence of nontrivial collective behavior . </S>",
    "<S> these results can be related to those of cisneros _ et al . _ [ 2002 ] who showed that the prediction error used to measure the mutual information transfer between a local and a global variable in a similar network decreased when nontrivial collective behavior arises in the system . </S>",
    "<S> thus , a high level of complexity can also be associated to an increase in the mutual information transfer between macroscopic and microscopic variables in a system .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , our intention is not to describe the human as network of interacting chaotic elements , but to show that the collective properties related to the concept of complexity are qualitatively similar , and that a rise in complexity can be associated with the emergency of collective ordered behavior in different systems . </S>"
