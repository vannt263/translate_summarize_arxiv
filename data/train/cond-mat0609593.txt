    "light on _ and _ light off _ state .",
    "the probability density function ( pdf ) of the times of sojourn or waiting times ( wts ) @xmath0 in these two states are denoted by the symbols @xmath1 and @xmath2 . in the case of blinking quantum dots ( bqds ) @xcite there is a general agreement that these are renewal processes , namely , that the jumps between the two states have the effect of resetting to zero the system s memory .",
    "the pdfs @xmath1 and @xmath2 are found to be inverse power laws , whose indexes are , according to ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite afford directions on how to distinguish a renewal non poisson process ( rnpp ) , which is a homogeneous in time process from the apparently equivalent condition generated by a non - homogeneous poisson process ( nhpp ) , _ i.e. _ , with a time dependent rate of event productions @xmath5 .",
    "let us recall that a ( homogeneous ) poisson process is a particular renewal process where the wt - pdf is an exponential function whose decay rate coincides with the ( constant ) rate of event productions .",
    "the physical origin of rnpps is still the object of research and debate , whereas that of nhpps requires however the identification of dynamics responsible for the rate time dependence . in this letter",
    "we consider the recent work of ref .",
    "@xcite , which establishes the influence of the catalytic activity of a fluctuating enzyme on the intermittent fluorescence of the fluorogenic substrate . in this case",
    "the function @xmath1 is exponential , and the complexity of the system is signaled by the function @xmath2 , which turns out to be a stretched exponential @xmath6 with @xmath7 .",
    "we argue that this is a nhpp , namely , an example of the second class of processes .",
    "according to the earlier work @xcite a non - exponential function can be expressed as the sum of infinitely many exponential functions @xcite . in refs .",
    "@xcite this condition was realized by means of the stochastic modulation of the event production rate @xmath5 . in the present case , we adopt a different kind of modulation , which is quasi - periodic , and this allows us to establish an evident connection with the popular stochastic resonance ( sr ) effect @xcite .",
    "sr is a phenomenon produced by making the event production rate depend harmonically on time , a condition generating a periodic wt reordering : the length of the wts as a function of the time order reproduces the rate time dependence @xcite . in this letter",
    "the quasi - periodic modulation has an internal origin and is based on the enzyme s conformation changes .",
    "the ultimate theoretical justification for the adoption of the periodic assumption is given by the work of winfree @xcite , who depicts the fundamental biological processes as operating through cyclical processes .",
    "thus , we assume that the enzyme s conformation changes are periodic , although non - harmonic , functions of time .",
    "we assume that the time duration of the _ on _ state is negligible , so that the system , after jumping from the _ off _ to the _ on _ state , jumps back to the _ off _ state almost immediately .",
    "thus , the _ on _ state is a kind of flashing snapshot , and the distance between two consecutive snapshots is described by @xmath2 .",
    "let us omit for simplicity s sake the subscript _ off _ and let us assign to @xmath8 the following form : @xmath9 being @xmath10 the exponential wt - pdf related to the poisson process with event production rate @xmath11 and @xmath12 the normalization constant .",
    "the quantity @xmath13 represents the statistical weight of each @xmath14 .",
    "we imagine @xmath5 to be a slow function of time , so as to produce many poissonian events with the same rate @xmath11 .",
    "this is called slow modulation condition , and it makes it possible to define @xmath13 on the basis of the enzyme s fluctuations .",
    "each enzyme conformation yields a given @xmath11 and the slower the enzyme s conformation change , the larger the statistical weight of this rate .",
    "it is thus obvious that in the slow modulation limit the statistical weight @xmath13 is inversely proportional to the modulus of @xmath15 : @xmath16 the parameter @xmath17 defines a time scale , driving the slope of q(t ) , which can be properly adjusted to fit the experimental results . in order to derive a periodic behavior for @xmath5",
    ", we assume the rate @xmath5 to increase in time from a minimum value @xmath18 to a maximum and very large value @xmath19 , from which it decays slowly to the minimum value again , and so on , thereby confining the stretched exponential distribution to a limited time range , which can , however , include several decades , depending on the choice of the parameters @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath17 .",
    "the switches between increasing and decreasing patterns of @xmath5 correspond to abrupt slope changes at times @xmath20 , which make @xmath5 piecewise smooth , and exactly periodic as well .",
    "however , once a wt is selected we leave it to stretch beyond the exact time period @xmath17 , thereby making the exactly periodic slope change produce random effects and quasi - periodicity . according to eq .",
    "( [ inverse ] ) , @xmath8 is the laplace transform of the function @xmath21 .",
    "thus , from the short - time limit , where the stretched exponential reads @xmath22 using the tauberian theorem , we find for @xmath13 , at @xmath23 , the following asymptotic expression @xmath24 by plugging eq .",
    "( [ useit ] ) within eq.([slowrate ] ) , we obtain the following equations : @xmath25 the integration of eq .",
    "( [ slowrate2 ] ) from @xmath26 to @xmath27 yields two different results depending on the sign : @xmath28 referring to the cases of increasing ( @xmath29 sign ) and decreasing ( @xmath30 sign ) rate , respectively . the times @xmath31 and @xmath32 are defined by @xmath33 and the parameter @xmath34 , determining the coefficient @xmath35 of the stretched exponential is given by @xmath36 these analytical results correspond to the correct derivation of the stretched exponential under the limiting condition of very slow modulation , namely , under the condition that @xmath17 is large enough .",
    "a periodic behavior of @xmath5 is defined by applying suitable time - shifts of the kind @xmath37 to the rates given in eqs .",
    "( [ solution_rate2 ] ) and  ( [ solution_rate ] ) .",
    "the purpose of this section is to assess by means of artificial sequences how large @xmath17 must be for the wt - pdf @xmath8 to fit the stretched exponential form of eq .",
    "( [ stretched ] ) . on the other hand",
    ", we note that the experimental results of ref .",
    "@xcite do not yield an exactly periodic time ordering .",
    "thus we plan to establish if it is possible to find values of @xmath17 that make @xmath8 fit the stretched exponential condition without producing a too markedly periodic time ordering , which would depart qualitatively from the experimental results of ref .",

    "the results are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ chr_ord ] , for different values of the parameter @xmath17 .",
    "we make the comparison among different values of @xmath17 with two distinct criteria : in the left column we adopt different numbers of wts , namely we refer to different chronological times , so as to produce the same number of abrupt slope changes of @xmath5 ; in the right column , on the contrary , the different plots contain the same number of wts , namely range from @xmath56 to the same maximum chronological time .",
    "the results of the right column allow us to establish a qualitative comparison with the experimental results of ref .",
    "furthermore , we see that in accordance with the stochastic resonance phenomenon @xcite , increasing @xmath17 has the effect of making more evident the resonant character of this effect .",
    "we see that the condition corresponding to @xmath57 , where the resonant effect is much less marked than in the case @xmath58 , produces the best qualitative agreement with the experimental result of ref .",
    "it is worth remarking that in this condition the wt - pdf @xmath8 still retains a markedly stretched exponential behavior so as to ensure a fully qualitative agreement with the experimental results of ref .",

    "to draw final conclusions we apply to the artificial sequences @xmath60 of section  [ numerical ] the aging experiment ( ae ) described in the earlier publication of ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we briefly recall that the method is based on the computation of the survival probabilities @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "both survival probabilities are aged and derived from time sequence by delaying the beginning of the waiting process for an event until a distance @xmath63 from each event of the sequence .",
    "@xmath64 is derived by applying this procedure to the time sequence , and @xmath65 is derived from the experimental histogram by assuming that the renewal condition holds true . upon increase of @xmath66 , both @xmath67 and @xmath68 can become much slower than @xmath69 .",
    "if @xmath70 , and both are slower than @xmath71 , this is the sign that the process is renewal and non - poissonian , insofar as in the poisson case , a renewal process does not yield aging . in fig .",
    "[ aging1 ] and fig .",
    "[ aging100 ] , we show a pair of dotted curves , illustrating @xmath67 at two different ages , and a pair of dashed curves , illustrating @xmath72 for the corresponding ages . in both cases",
    "the two curves of the latter pair generate a decay significantly slower than @xmath71 .",
    "this is only a consequence of the fact that @xmath71 is a stretched exponential .",
    "we see , however , that in fig .",
    "[ aging1 ] both dotted curves are slower than @xmath71 , although faster than the corresponding dashed curves , thereby indicating that a form of aging may exist , albeit significantly reduced .",
    "this is an indication that many renewal events are present  @xcite . in the case of fig .",
    "[ aging100 ] , on the contrary , the two dotted curves virtually coincide with @xmath71 , if we neglect the short - time region , thereby implying that the deviation from exponential relaxation is caused by a so slow modulation as to cancel all the renewal events that may be non - poissonian .",
    "we note that the condition of reduced aging of fig .",
    "[ aging1 ] corresponds to @xmath48 , which , as shown by fig .",
    "[ chr_ord ] , generates for the chronological order a structure qualitatively similar to that of the experimental results of ref .",
    "+ we thus conclude that the sequence of wts emerging from the experimental results of ref .",
    "@xcite may be a nhpp , generated by a stochastic resonance produced by the enzyme s conformation changes .",
    "the debate on whether non - exponential relaxation is due to inhomogeneities or cooperative molecular motion is of wide interest in biophysics ( see , for instance ref .",
    "we note that the recent letter of ref .",
    "@xcite confirms the stretched nature of the wt - pdf of ref .",
