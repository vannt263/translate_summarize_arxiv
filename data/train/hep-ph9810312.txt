    "the scalar density of quarks develops a non - vanishing ground state expectation value , the chiral condensate @xmath7 .",
    "the hellmann - feynman theorem suggests that the magnitude of this condensate decreases with increasing baryon density @xcite at a rate determined , to linear order in density , by the pion - nucleon sigma term . at the density of normal nuclear matter , @xmath8 , the condensate changes from its value at @xmath9 by roughly 30 % .",
    "spontaneously broken chiral symmetry is expected to be restored at high temperatures and possibly at very high baryon densities . at that point",
    "the masses of the ( @xmath10 ) vector mesons should become degenerate with those of their chiral partners , the ( @xmath11 ) axial vector mesons .",
    "one expects that in - medium vector meson spectra should show traces of this tendency already at moderate densities .",
    "in particular , if vector mesons experience a sufficiently strong attractive potential in matter , they could form bound states with ordinary nuclei .",

    ". more detailed analysis @xcite has revealed that the @xmath12 meson is probably not a good signal since its large vacuum width of about 150 mev will be further magnified by in - medium reactions .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath2 meson appears to be a better candidate @xcite .",
    "its small width in free space ( about 8 mev ) might increase by a factor of five or so in nuclear matter , but this is still within reasonable limits so that the @xmath2 meson has a chance to survive as a quasi - particle in the nuclear medium . at the same time",
    "the calculations suggest that its in - medium mass is shifted downward by about 15% at @xmath13 @xcite , an amount consistent with the original qcd sum rule analysis @xcite .",
    "while much of the recent activities have focused on possible in - medium modifications of vector mesons spectra in the context of ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions , it is certainly useful to explore such effects under less extreme , better controled conditions : hence the quest for possible @xmath2 meson ( quasi- ) bound states in ordinary nuclei .",
