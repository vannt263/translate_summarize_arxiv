    "theoretical studies on black holes have attracted substantial attention since the advent of general relativity .",
    "it is well known that black holes can not be directly observed but they can be detected through their action on their neighborhoods .",
    "the behavior of the matter and fields surrounding a black hole not only tells us about its presence but also helps us determine its parameters .",
    "a real black hole can never be fully described by its basic parameters ( mass , charge and angular momentum ) and is always in the perturbed state ( @xcite ) . for several decades",
    ", many efforts are made in investigating the evolution of external field perturbation around black holes .",
    "these perturbations lead to damped oscillations called quasinormal modes(@xcite ) .",
    "different kinds of perturbation in the geometry of a black hole can excite certain combination of its characteristic frequencies of the normal modes for which the frequencies are no longer purely real showing that the system is losing energy .",
    "the real part of qn frequency represents the ring down frequency and the imaginary part , the decay time .",
    "the resonant frequencies of the response of external perturbations called quasinormal frequencies are one of the most essential characteristics of black holes .",
    "it is widely believed that the qnms carry a unique characteristic `` fingerprint '' which would lead to the direct identification of the black hole existence .",
    "quasinormal modes associated with perturbations of different fields were considered in a lot of works ( @xcite ) .",
    "we know that the vacuum undergoes quantum fluctuations .",
    "this phenomenon is the appearance of energetic particles out of nothing , as allowed by the uncertainty principle .",
    "vacuum fluctuations have observable consequences like casimir force between two plates in vacuum . due to quantum fluctuations",
    ", the evolution of slices in the black hole geometry will lead to the creation of particle pairs which facilitates black holes radiation ( @xcite ) .",
    "it was shown that quantum vacuum fluctuations modify the geometry of the schwarzschild black hole .",
    "@xcite obtained new expressions of the schwarzschild metric when the back reaction of the spacetime due to quantum fluctuations is taken into account .",
    "recently , wontae and yongwan ( @xcite ) investigated phase transition of the quantum - corrected schwarzschild black hole and concluded that there appear a type of grass - perry - yaffe phase transition due to the quantum vacuum fluctuations and this held even for the very small size black hole .",
    "more recently , we investigate qnms of scalar perturbation around a quantum - corrected schwarzschild black hole and show that the scalar field damps more slowly and oscillates more slowly due to the quantum fluctuations ( @xcite ) . in this paper , the qnms of a quantum - corrected schwarzschild black hole is investigated in order to highlight the behavior of a gravitational and dirac perturbations when the vacuum fluctuations are taken into account .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec:1 ] ,",
    "the quantum - corrected schwarzschild black hole is presented . in section  [ sec:01 ]",
    ", we derive the wave equation of a gravitational perturbation in the quantum - corrected schwarzschild black hole background . in section  [ sec:2 ] , the wave equation for dirac perturbation of the black hole",
    "is derived . in section  [ sec:3 ]",
    ", we evaluate the qn frequencies of the gravitational and dirac perturbations by using the third order wkb approximation method .",
    "the last section is devoted to a summary and conclusion .",
    "according to the work of kazakov and solodukhin on quantum deformation of the schwarzschild solution ( @xcite ) , the background metric of the schwarzschild black hole is defined by @xmath1 where @xmath2    for an empty space , @xmath3 .",
    "thus we obtain the schwarzschild metric @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the black hole mass .    taking into account the quantum fluctuation of vacuum , the quantity @xmath6 transforms to ( @xcite ) @xmath7 where @xmath8",
    ", @xmath9 is the newton constant and @xmath10 is a scale parameter .",
    "the background metric of the quantum - corrected schwarzschild black hole can then be read as    @xmath11    with @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the quantum correction parameter @xmath0 has the dimensionality of length @xmath14 $ ] .    using this form of the metric",
    ", the scalar curvature of the spacetime is transformed to @xmath15\\ ] ] as we can see , the scalar curvature does not depend on the mass of the gravitating body but depends on the quantum correction parameter .    for large @xmath16 , the metric becomes @xmath17 which looks like the metric of a charged body with mass @xmath5 and imaginary charge @xmath18 .",
    "thus , we can say that the quantum correction parameter @xmath0 acts as an imaginary charge added to the spacetime metric .",
    "its coincides with the reissner - nordstrm metric but with an imaginary electric charge .",
    "it is therefore interesting for us to evaluate the qnms of the schwarzschild black hole when the quantum fluctuations modify it .",
    "for the gravitational perturbation , we will deal with the regge - wheeler gauge ( @xcite ) . in this gauge",
    ", the gravitational perturbation is regarded as perturbation to the background metric .",
    "we regard the perturbed background metric @xmath19 as the sum of the unperturbed metric @xmath20 and the perturbation in it @xmath21 @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the perturbed metric .",
    "the perturbations @xmath24 are supposed to be very small compared with @xmath25 .",
    "the @xmath24 can be calculated from @xmath25 , and @xmath26 from @xmath27 .",
    "the quantity @xmath28 can be expressed in the form(@xcite )    @xmath29    where @xmath30 similarly , we will use the unperturbed christoffel symbols in computing covariant derivatives of perturbation quantities . from eq .",
    "( [ 8 ] ) it follows that @xmath31 the perturbed christoffel symbols are given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 the last equation reveals that the variation of the christoffel symbols , @xmath34 , forms a tensor , even though the christoffel symbols themselves do not .",
    "adopting the @xcite matching , the final canonical form for an odd wave is then @xmath35    this form represents the perturbation of a spherically symmetric black hole in regge - wheeler gauge .",
    "the radial wave equation is the final equation which gives us the behavior of the perturbation s oscillation .",
    "it can be reduced to a simple linear differential equation .    in vacuum",
    ", the perturbed field equations simply reduce to ( @xcite ) @xmath36    using that and the background metric , we get from @xmath37 , @xmath38=0 \\end{array}\\ ] ] and from @xmath39 , @xmath40 defining @xmath41 and @xmath42 and eliminating @xmath43 , we then get @xmath44 where @xmath45 equation ( [ 19 ] ) is a second order linear differential equation which represents a perturbation equation .",
    "the potential @xmath46 depends explicitly on the radius @xmath47 .",
    "its behavior is represented on fig.[fig:1 ] .        through this figures",
    ", we can see that the potential decreases with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , the potential takes constant values when @xmath48 evolves to infinity .",
    "that allows us using the wkb approximation method provided by iyer and will ( @xcite ) to evaluate the quasinormal frequencies .",

    "the qn frequencies correspond to solution of perturbation equation which satisfy the boundary conditions appropriate for purely ingoing waves at the horizon and purely outgoing waves at infinity .",
    "incoming and outgoing waves correspond to the radial solution proportional to @xmath79 and @xmath80 , respectively .",
    "only a discrete set of complex frequencies satisfies these conditions .",

    "dirac quasinormal frequencies are summarized in tables [ tab:3 ] and [ tab:4 ] for the cases of the schwarzschild black hole with and without quantum correction , respectively . through the above tables",
    ", we can remark that the absolute values of the imaginary parts of the quasinormal frequencies of the quantum - corrected black hole are smaller compared to those without quantum correction , for fixed set of @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",

    "that can be clearly seen through figs .",
    "[ fig:2 ] and [ fig:002 ] . through fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] , we an also remark that the real parts of dirac quasinormal frequencies are higher compared to gravitational ones .",
    "that implies that dirac qnms oscillate more rapidly than gravitational ones . concerning the real parts",
    ", they are also decreasing when increasing @xmath0 .",
    "thus , we can conclude that , due to the quantum fluctuations , the quasinormal modes of gravitational and dirac perturbations of the schwarzschild black hole damp more slowly and oscillate more slowly .",
