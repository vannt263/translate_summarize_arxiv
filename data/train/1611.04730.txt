    "a few nonlinear variants of the quantum kicked rotor have been devised @xcite in order to investigate the impact of nonlinearity on the dynamical localization , which is the prototypical feature of that model @xcite ; for some of them possible experimental realizations with bose - einstein condensates have been surmised .",
    "the most recent @xcite is described by a family of nonlinear maps in the @xmath1-dimensional space of functions @xmath2 on the @xmath3 torus @xmath4 : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the linear operator @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is the nonlinear operator : @xmath9 parameters @xmath10 are non - negative reals .",
    "the linear quantum kicked rotor is described by @xmath11 . for @xmath12",
    "the map is obtained when the so - called split - operator method is used to approximate the continuous - time gross - pitaevski ( gp ) ( or `` cubic '' nonlinear schrdinger ) dynamics on the torus , so here it will be dubbed gp map . in this paper chaotic motion in the gp map is studied .",
    "motivation is provided by reports @xcite of exponential growth of energy ( energy in state @xmath13 is defined as @xmath14 , where @xmath15 denotes @xmath16-derivative ) , and exponentially fast separation of wave packets @xcite when the period @xmath17 is incommensurate to @xmath0 . in the present paper",
    "such issues are investigated in detail , and the above results are completed and significantly extended . the gp map is taken as a fully classical dynamical system , and the onset of chaos is studied by a systematic analysis of lyapunov exponents ( le ) , computed by numerically iterating the tangent map to ( [ map0 ] ) . as exponential instability is not crucially related to the presence of a cosine potential , the suffix @xmath18 is henceforth removed and @xmath19 is understood .",
    "+ exponential growth of energy is just a special case of this lyapunov analysis , because it is equivalent to exponentially fast divergence of trajectories which initially differ by an infinitesimal rotation .",
    "it is worth noting that early studies on the `` quantum suppression of classical chaos '' have long ago pointed out that quantum chaotic behaviour - if any ! - should display exponential energy growth @xcite .",
    "anyway in the present paper the gp map is a purely classical dynamical system ; a comment about quantum chaos is deferred to the concluding remarks in sec.[concr ] .",
    "+ the alleged exponential instability of @xmath1-dimensional dynamics poses a delicate task to numerical investigation , which of necessity uses finite dimensional approximations .",
    "such approximations define measure preserving dynamical systems on finite dimensional phase spaces , for which - unlike the @xmath1-dimensional case - existence of lyapunov exponents is an exact result ; it is these very les that are numerically computed , finding evidence of chaotic transitions in the finite dimensional dynamics .",
    "remarkably , they are observed to uniformly stabilize when the basis size is large enough , supporting the conjecture , that they reflect properties of the @xmath1-dimensional dynamics .",
    "a theoretical explanation is obtained , noting that , for large dimension , ergodicity and levy s lemma about the concentration of measure @xcite justify a mean - field approach to the tangent dynamics .",
    "doing so allows a transparent derivation of a simple formula , that describes the dependence of the maximal lyapunov exponent on the nonlinearity parameter @xmath20 .",
    "the finite dimension does not appear any more in this formula , which coincides with one that was obtained in @xcite by means of a different argument and for the special case of energy growth .",
    "for `` stationary '' orbits of the gp map the whole lyapunov spectrum is analytically computed in sect.[sstat ] ; it turns out that , whenever the period @xmath17 is incommensurate to @xmath0 , and for any nonvanishing nonlinearity , such orbits are linearly unstable in infinitely many directions , and linearly stable in infinitely many ones .",
    "the hitherto unexplored case when the period @xmath17 is commensurate to @xmath0 : @xmath21 , with @xmath22 mutually prime integers , is studied in sect.[reso ] . in that case",
    "the gp map has infinitely many independent constants of the motion and the @xmath1-dimensional phase space is fibered in @xmath23-dimensional fibers . over each such fiber",
    "the gp map defines a ( lebesgue ) measure - preserving dynamical system , with well - defined lyapunov exponents .",
    "this system appears to undergo an integrable - chaotic transition as @xmath20 is increased , that is also mirrored in the global dynamics .",
    "the following properties of the gp map are straightforward : + 1 - @xmath24 is a continuous , invertible operator in the hilbert space @xmath25",
    ". it also preserves the hilbert norm : @xmath26 .",
    "thanks to this property , one may always resort to states normalized to unity by rescaling @xmath20 .",
    "such normalization is assumed throughout the following .",
    "@xmath24 is continuous , though not norm - preserving , also in the hilbert space @xmath27 of absolutely continuous functions with a square - integrable derivative , with the `` energy norm '' : @xmath28 2 - @xmath24 preserves a symplectic form , see eqn.([symp ] ) below ; + 3 - @xmath24 is rotation invariant : @xmath29 , @xmath30 , where @xmath31 .",
    "+ 4 - scaling symmetry : @xmath32 , @xmath33 ; + 5 - whenever @xmath17 is commensurate to @xmath0 : @xmath21 , @xmath22 integers , @xmath34 .",
    "+ 6 - analyticity is preserved : if @xmath35 is an analytic function in @xmath36 and @xmath37 , then @xmath38 is analytically continued in @xmath39 to : @xmath40 this in particular implies that the asymptotic rate of exponential decay of @xmath41 over the fourier basis is unchanged under the gp dynamics .",
    "the tangent dynamics to the map ( [ map ] ) will be studied in the _ real _ hilbert spaces @xmath42 , @xmath43 of couples @xmath44 , with @xmath45 or @xmath46 respectively .",
    "formal differentiation with respect to @xmath13 , @xmath47 along a trajectory @xmath48 , @xmath49 , yields the following `` variation equation '' : @xmath50 where : @xmath51 eqn.([var ] ) defines linear operators @xmath52 in @xmath42 , @xmath43 such that @xmath53 ( where @xmath54 now stands for @xmath55 , and similarly for @xmath56 ) .",
    "they are not bounded in @xmath42 except for special choices of @xmath13 . in @xmath43",
    "the operator @xmath57 is the frchet differential of the map that is defined in @xmath43 by ( [ map0 ] ) .",
    "it preserves the symplectic form : @xmath58 or , in the fourier basis : @xmath59 exponential instability of a trajectory @xmath48 is related to positivity of some lyapunov exponent ( le ) of the trajectory .",
    "here les are defined by : @xmath60 with @xmath61 .",
    "0.2 cm    1.cm    0.2 cm    no argument is given here why such @xmath62 should be finite . in principle , they depend on the chosen trajectory , and on the choice of an initial @xmath63 . all trajectories exhibit at least one zero le .",
    "for instance , if @xmath64 with @xmath65 real arbitrary , then eqn.([var ] ) entails @xmath66 at all times .",
    "the rate of exponential growth of energy along a trajectory , divided by @xmath67 , is itself a le .",
    "this follows from : @xmath68 where @xmath15 denotes @xmath69derivative .",
    "hence : @xmath70 the present study of les is based on numerical solution of the variation equation ( [ var ] ) .",
    "fig.[vstime ] shows the behavior in time of the logarithm of energy , and of @xmath71 as defined in ( [ le1 ] ) .",
    "the initial @xmath72 is a coherent state centered at momentum @xmath73 and @xmath74 , with @xmath75 ; @xmath63 is a randomly generated vector : @xmath76rand@xmath77 , with rand@xmath78 independent , normally distributed random variables .",
    "of course , numerical simulations do not address the true @xmath1-dimensional dynamics , but the finite - dimensional dynamics that are obtained on restricting @xmath24 to a finite - n- dimensional fourier subspace , and on discretizing the circle in a grid of @xmath79 points .",
    "such finite - dimensional dynamics implement finite fourier transforms , and are defined by norm - preserving maps in a hypersphere in @xmath80 , where they preserve the symplectic form ( [ symp ] ) .",
    "they are therefore ( lebesgue ) measure - preserving , and define classical dynamical systems , for which existence ( almost everywhere ) of les is an exact result .",
    "energy in state @xmath13 is computed as @xmath81 , where @xmath82 .",
    "it is initially almost constant ( fluctuations are suppressed in the logarithmic scale ) , then fast exponential growth @xmath83 is observed , quickly leading to saturation of the basis ; energy remains thereafter stationary .",
    "instead the `` local divergence of trajectories '' , as measured by @xmath71 , after a short logarithmic increase ( the duration of which depends on @xmath20 ) enters a steady linear growth , yielding a positive le @xmath62 . sampling different choices of @xmath72",
    "suggests that @xmath62 should be independent of @xmath72 ( with at least one notable exception : the fourier basis functions studied in sec.[sstat ] , see below ) .",
    "the finite - n dynamics only enjoys a discrete rotational invariance , so the argument in eqs.([rotinv1 ] ) , ( [ rotinv2 ] ) breaks down , and energy does not any more define a le proper . when @xmath84 it was observed that @xmath85 , ( half the transient rate of exponential growth of energy ) , as in eq.([rotinv2 ] ) ; not so at smaller @xmath20 , however : _",
    "e.g. _ , for @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 are read in the exponential range .",
    "it must be noted , however , that the onset of exponential instability is observed the later , the smaller @xmath20 is , and its reliable detection eventually falls beyond the computational capabilities of the present work . at smaller times , @xmath71 increases logarithmically , as trajectories separate linearly in time .    remarkably , for large basis size @xmath79 the numerically computed @xmath62 appear to stabilize . that notwithstanding , identifying them with le exponents of the @xmath1-dimensional dynamics implies interchanging the @xmath89 and the @xmath90 limits , so , on strictly logical grounds , caution is needed . however , with the gp map @xmath91 reaches its limit value well before saturation is attained ; moreover , it is the whole @xmath71 vs @xmath92 curves , and not only their slopes , that appear to stabilize at large @xmath79 .",
    "this may be an empirical indication that , at least for the very smooth @xmath13 , @xmath93 which were used , at large @xmath79 the numerical finite - n les do indeed mirror properties of the @xmath1-dimensional dynamics .",
    "a measure for the filling of the basis is provided by the normalized inverse participation ratio : @xmath94 the maximum value of @xmath95 is @xmath96 and is attained when @xmath97 , @xmath98 ; and the average of @xmath95 over the uniform , normalized measure on the unit sphere in @xmath80 is asymptotically equal to @xmath99 in the limit @xmath100@xcite .",
    "its dependence on @xmath92 is also shown in fig.[vstime ] . like energy , this quantity saturates ,",
    "and remains thereafter quite close ( within @xmath101% ) to the `` microcanonical '' average @xmath99 .",
    "the microcanonical average of energy is @xmath102 , which , for @xmath103 , is consistent with the value @xmath104 that is observed at saturation in fig.[vstime ] .",
    "the approximate constancy in time ( after saturation ) of ipr suggests ergodicity , because it would then be explained by the concentration of measure ( levy s lemma ) @xcite , according to which ipr is close to its mean value . ] in a subset of the sphere , whose measure is exponentially close to @xmath96 for large @xmath79 .",
    "ergodicity ( approximate , at least ) is also supported by the observed independence of @xmath62 on the choice of an initial state ( not so with @xmath105 , which is sensitive to the filling of the basis by the chosen state ) . if ergodicity of the @xmath79-dynamics is assumed , the following ( non - exact ) argument yields a good estimate for @xmath62 at large @xmath79 .",
    "the state vector is now a @xmath79-vector with components @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and lies on a hypersphere of radius @xmath108 in @xmath80 , where @xmath109 the tangent dynamics is still described by eqn.([var ] ) , where @xmath110 is now a @xmath79-vector .",
    "a simple calculation yields : latexmath:[\\[\\label{simple0 }    for large @xmath79 , ergodicity and levy s lemma suggest replacing the @xmath56-dependent quantities in ( [ simple0 ] ) by their uniform averages @xmath112 over the hypersphere .",
    "this yields @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the phase of @xmath115 . in long - time iterates of ( [ simple ] ) , with rapid growth of @xmath110 the dominant contribution can be assumed to come from the phase - independent term .",
    "using that @xmath116 , and summing over @xmath117 : @xmath118 finally , for @xmath79 large ( [ norma ] ) yields @xmath119 remarkably , @xmath79 has dropped out of this asymptotic formula .",
    "the same formula was obtained in ref.@xcite for the rate of exponential growth of the square root of energy , by means of a diffusion - based argument , and is in overall excellent agreement with numerical data shown in fig.[vsalpha ] . some agreement with numerical data for @xmath62 ( but not with data for @xmath105 )",
    "persists for small values of @xmath20 , when computations require much longer times than @xmath120 . in the case",
    "when @xmath86 @xmath121 was observed , whereas ( [ lyap ] ) yields @xmath122 .",
    "+ the possible survival of stable regions at small @xmath20 is beyond the scope of this paper . however , as shown in the next section , for finite @xmath79 certain stationary orbits are linearly stable for @xmath20 smaller than a threshold value , which however decreases to @xmath73 in the limit @xmath89 , and is already quite small for the cases considered here .",
