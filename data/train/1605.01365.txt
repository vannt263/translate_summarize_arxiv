    "it has been known for some time that the curve of a lvy process in @xmath0 is typically an interesting `` random fractal . '' for example , if @xmath1 is a standard brownian motion on @xmath0 , then the image and graph of @xmath2 have hausdorff dimension @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively .",
    "if in addition @xmath5 , then the level sets of @xmath2 also have non - trivial hausdorff dimension @xmath6 .",
    "see the survey papers of taylor @xcite and xiao @xcite for historic accounts on these results and further developments .    the beginning student is often presented with some of these `` random - fractal facts '' via simulation .",
    "the well - versed reader will see in figure [ fig : bm ] a typical example . as a consequence of such a simulation , one",
    "is led to believe that one can deduce from a simulation , such as that in figure [ fig : bm ] , the fractal nature of the graph @xmath7 of brownian motion up to time @xmath8 .",
    "figure [ fig : bm ] , and other such simulations , are produced by running a random walk for a long time and then rescaling , using a central - limit scaling .",
    "the process is usually explained by appealing to donsker s invariance principle .",
    "unfortunately , the actual statement of donsker s invariance principle is not sufficiently strong to ensure that we can `` see '' the various fractal properties of brownian motion in simulations . though barlow and taylor @xcite have introduced a theory of large - scale random fractals which , among other things , provides a more rigorous justification .",
    "one of the goals of this paper is to test the extent to which one can experimentally deduce large - scale geometric facts about brownian motion  and sometimes more general lvy processes  from simulation analysis .",
    "this is achieved by presenting several examples in which one is able to compute the macroscopic fractal dimension of a macroscopic random fractal .",
    "one of the surprising lessons of this exercise is that our intuition is , at times , faulty .",
    "yet , our instincts are correct at other times .",
    "here is an example in which our intuition is spot on : it is known that the level sets of brownian motion have dimension @xmath6 , both macroscopically and microscopically .",
    "this statement has the pleasant consequence that we can `` see '' the fractal structure of the level sets of brownian motion from figure [ fig : bm ] .",
    "as we shall soon see , however , the same can not be said of the graph of brownian motion : the microscopic and macroscopic fractal dimensions of the graph of brownian motion do not agree !    in order to keep the technical level of the paper as low as possible , our choice of `` fractal dimension '' is the macroscopic minkowski dimension , which we will present in the following section .",
