    "<S> they are symmetric with respect to @xmath18 , which means that the different @xmath0 topological orders can not be distinguished by the local order parameter .    by performing complete quantum state tomography @xcite , we reconstructed the density matrices for @xmath12 order ( @xmath105 ) , for the spin - polarized state ( @xmath106 ) and @xmath11 order ( @xmath107 ) for @xmath108 . </S>",
    "<S> the real parts of these density matrices are shown in fig.[fig : results](c ) , ( d ) and ( e ) . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental fidelities are @xmath109 @xmath110 and @xmath111 , respectively . from these reconstructed density matrices </S>",
    "<S> , we also calculated the entanglement : for both topological orders , @xmath112 , while the others were close to 0 ; for the spin - polarized state , all @xmath113 are almost zero . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath114 is the reduced density matrix of two spins @xmath115 obtained by partially tracing out the other spins from the experimentally reconstructed density matrix @xmath116 and the concurrence is defined as @xmath117 , where @xmath118s ( in decreasing order ) are the square roots of the eigenvalues of @xmath119@xcite . </S>",

    "<S> these experimental results are in good agreement with theoretical expectations . </S>",
    "<S> the relatively minor deviations can be attributed mostly to the imperfections of the grape pulses , the initial ground state preparation and the spectral integrals @xcite .    . </S>",

    "<S> one example is the wen - plaquette model , which includes many - body interactions . </S>",
    "<S> such interactions have not been found in naturally occurring systems , but they can be generated as effective interactions in quantum simulators . using an nmr quantum simulator , </S>",
    "<S> we provide a first proof - of - principle experiment that implements an adiabatic transition between two different @xmath1 topological orders through a spin - polarized state in the transverse wen - plaquette model . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite presented a numerical study of a qpt from a spin - polarized to a topologically ordered phase using a variety of previously proposed qpt detectors and demonstrated their feasibility . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we also demonstrated in an experiment that the nonlocal wilson loop operator can be a nontrivial detector of topological qpt between different topological orders . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon requires further investigation to be properly understood .    </S>",
    "<S> although a @xmath134 lattice is a very small finite - size system , topological orders exist in the wen - plaquette model with periodic lattice of finite size @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the validity of the quantum simulation of the topological orders in such a small system also comes from the fairly short - range spin - spin correlations . when @xmath135 , all quasi - particles ( the electric charges , magnetic vortices and fermions ) perfectly localize that leads to zero spin - spin correlation length @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the topological properties of the ground state persist in such a small system , including the topological degeneracy , the statistics of the quasi - particles and the non - zero wilson loop @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the present method can in principle be expanded to larger systems with more spins , which allows one to explore more interesting physical phenomena , such as lattice - dependent topological degeneracy @xcite , quasiparticle fractional statistics @xcite and the robustness of the ground state degeneracy against local perturbations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> quantum simulators using larger spin systems can be more powerful than classical computers and permit the research of topological orders and their physics beyond the capabilities of classical computers . nevertheless , our present experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of small quantum simulators for strongly correlated quantum systems , and the usefulness of the adiabatic method for constructing and initializing a topological quantum memory .    </S>",
