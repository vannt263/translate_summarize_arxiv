    "several promising ideas are motivations for this paper :    \\(i ) the newest , and perhaps most interesting , of the dualities of string theory is the one conjectured by maldacena , which relates the large n expansion of gauge theories ( conformal field theories ) in @xmath5 dimensions to string theory on the product of @xmath6-dimensional anti - de sitter ( @xmath7 ) space with a compact manifold @xcite .",
    "( i ) in fact , the ads / cft correspondence is an example of the t hooft holographic principle according to which a quantum theory with gravity must be described by a boundary theory @xcite .",
    "\\(ii ) the green s idea is that the two - dimensional world - sheet underlying the dynamics of string theory may itself emerge as the embedding space of a two - dimensional string theory which has a more primitive structure @xcite .",
    "\\(iii ) in general , a supersymmetry algebra contains central charges that couple to topological quantum numbers of solitons @xcite . in the stringy context",
    "these charges are carried by p - branes .",
    "each of these ideas has its own attractive features , so it serves as a subject for numerous investigations .",
    "in particular , the possible relation of string theory on @xmath4 to conformal field theory has been a subject of much interest ; see [ 6 , 8 - 13 ] for discussions motivated by recent developments , and additional references .",
    "it is amusing , however , that all these ideas can be found as elements of a construction which is superstring theory on @xmath4 .",
    "it is clear that applying the ideas together should help us with understanding such construction , so it will be the purpose of this paper",
    ".    world - sheet description of superstring theory on @xmath4 has been initiated by giveon , kutasov and seiberg @xcite who started with the bosonic part of the world - sheet lagrangian or , what is equivalent , with the @xmath8 term of the corresponding @xmath9 model @xmath10 and transformed it into a form corresponding to the wakimoto free field representation of the sl(2 ) wess - zumino - witten model . in this case",
    "the interaction term becomes the screening operator of the @xmath11 algebra .",
    "the @xmath12 superconformal algebra on the world - sheet is achieved by introducing free fermions that are lower components of superfields .",
    "they also succeeded in finding the global @xmath1 superconformal algebra for the neveu - schwarz ( ns ) sector in space - time .    in spite of certain progress in understanding string propagation on @xmath4 the description of giveon and co - workers",
    "is subjected to some drawbacks .",
    "one of them is that space - time @xmath1 algebra ( boundary algebra ) is not realized in a manifestly supersymmetric way .",
    "moreover , the use of the standard procedure for building fermionic vertices by @xcite does not allow one to explicitly write down all the fermionic generators of the algebra .",
    "recently ito proposed a simple remedy to improve the situation .",
    "he based on the wakimoto free field representations of some affine lie superalgebras @xcite .",
    "his construction provides the @xmath13 superconformal algebras in space - time through the world - sheet @xmath14 affine superalgebras , respectively .",
    "are also known from the drinfeld - sokolov reduction , which is an entirely different topic . ]",
    "however , the construction discussed in @xcite remains inconsistent because , while the holographic principle says that string theory on @xmath4 is described by a boundary theory , the boundary @xmath1 algebra is built in terms of all @xmath4 coordinates rather than the boundary ones only ; improving this will be the first goal of the present paper .",
    "moreover , the realization of the number of ns5-branes as the level of the world - sheet @xmath11 algebra does not look attractive too .",
    "the point is that it does not allow one to interpret the central charge of the boundary algebra in a purely topological way ( from the world - sheet point of view ) .",
    "so , this will be our second goal . at the present time it is not known whether these goals may be achieved .",
    "so we are bound to learn something if we succeed .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe a formal construction for lifting bosonized affine lie algebras on the world - sheet into two - dimensional space - time",
    ". we will not only reproduce the known results , but find rather amusing relations between @xmath15 superconformal algebras and affine lie superalgebras @xmath2 , @xmath3 .",
    "in particular , such 2d space - time may be considered as the boundary of @xmath4 .",
    "section 3 will present some applications to string on @xmath4 .",
    "we give a prescription for the calculation of space - time correlators and possible mechanism for taking into account ns5-branes in a purely topological way .",
    "section 4 will present the conclusions and directions for future work . in the appendices we give technical details which are relevant for the explicit construction of the affine lie superalgebras in space - time and computation of some correlators .",
    "we now turn to the problem of the correspondence between symmetries on the world - sheet and two - dimensional space - time . in particular",
    ", the latter may be the boundary of @xmath4 . in this case",
    "one can consider a construction by starting with the euclidean version of @xmath4 whose coordinates are @xmath16 and restricting the analysis to the problem of building superconformal algebras in space - time which is the boundary of @xmath4 with coordinates @xmath17 ( see subsection 3.1.4 for details ) .",
    "thanks to the underlying world - sheet structure such construction may be called the stringy representation of affine superalgebras . however , before we give examples , it might be useful to present some mathematical background .",
    "let @xmath18 be a point on the world - sheet which is a riemann surface and @xmath19 be a coordinate patch such that @xmath20 and @xmath21 for @xmath18 .",

    "let there is a map @xmath24 , i.e. the local embedding of the world - sheet into space - time .",
    "it is useful to classify such maps by their degrees , i.e. integers @xmath25 which are given by @xmath26 where the contour @xmath27 surrounds @xmath28 .",

    "is interpreted as the topological charge is interpreted as the number of infinitely stretched fundamental strings at the boundary of @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "we will see in section 3 that there is also another interpretation . ] .      as a warmup ,",
    "let us consider the virasoro algebra in space - time and , as by - product , reproduce the result of @xcite .",
    "the most obvious way to do this is the following .",
    "consider a differential operator realization of the virasoro algebra . by substitutions @xmath32 where @xmath33 are now the quantum fields , we get the quantum algebra .",
    "this is the standard machinery for building the wakimoto free field representation within 2d conformal field theories .",

    "now , let us assume that there is one more free field on the world - sheet .",
    "let it be a scalar field @xmath39 whose op expansion is @xmath40 .",
    "the most obvious generalization of what we have just done is @xmath41 a simple algebra shows that such defined @xmath42 s obey only for @xmath43 with @xmath44 .",
    "this improved construction gives the central charge @xmath45 .    on the other hand ,",
    "the set of the free fields we used is exactly what one needs to build the wakimoto free field representation of the @xmath11 algebra .",

    "we will return to a discussion of this point in section 3 .",
    "the generalization of the above construction is obtained simply by adding fermionic coordinates , which makes the space - time supersymmetry manifest . in the simplest case that we will consider we add a fermionic coordinate @xmath51 that geometrically turns space - time into a superspace .",
    "in general one would expect the @xmath12 superconformal structure for this case .",

    ", we can obtain the leading terms in the quantum generators .",
    "finally , we can compute the `` exact '' generators , getting for instance @xmath57 to define the generators in the ramond and topological sectors we need rational powers of @xmath58 .",
    "this can be done either by analytic continuation or by bosonization .",
    "we will return to this point later in section 3 .",

    "it is also not difficult to build the @xmath12 superconformal algebra starting from the following differential operators ( subset of ) @xmath64 the analysis proceeds as in above and leads to the @xmath12 superconformal algebra with an arbitrary central charge . for a special case",
    "we recover the result by ito @xcite .      having the @xmath0 superconformal algebra",
    ", we now wish to realize the @xmath1 superconformal algebra in a similar way .",

    ", the scalar fields do nt appear .",
    "nevertheless from it follows that we can write @xmath82    finally , let us discuss a relation with the result of ito @xcite . to do this",

    "we recover the result by ito @xcite .",
    "moreover , having the @xmath0 superconformal algebra , we can also get the @xmath12 algebra as it has been done in the previous subsection .",
    "after our rather formal discussion of the construction of space - time symmetries and their relation to the affine lie superalgebras , let us now look more specifically at their relation to string theory .",
    "the simplest example to consider is the bosonic part of strings on @xmath4 , i.e. the virasoro algebra in space - time",
    ". this will be the subject of subsection 3.1 . later in subsection 3.2",
    "we will generalize our analysis to include fermions and concentrate on the properties of the @xmath1 superconformal algebra in space - time .",
    "_ 3.1.1 reparametrization invariant vertex operators or more ?",
    "_ in general , the string vertex operators creating physical states are the primary conformal fields .",
    "moreover , the reparametrization ( conformal ) invariance of the theory dictates that the vertices have dimension one in both @xmath84 and @xmath85 so that their integral over @xmath86 is invariant ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we now wish to apply this to vertex operators . with the aid of eq . , it can be shown that @xmath87 is the primary conformal field of dimension one only for @xmath49 .",
    "it is exactly what was found by giveon and co - workers @xcite .",
    "one of the novelties that appears due to two - dimensional space - time is that it is possible to give another interpretation .",
    "defining the virasoro generators on the world - sheet by the standard way @xmath88 the stringy definition of the vertex operator can be represented by @xmath89=0\\quad,\\ ] ] i.e. there are two copies of the virasoro algebra living on the world - sheet and in space - time , respectively and these algebras commute .",
    "one of the reasons why this formulation sounds interesting is that the world - sheet and space - time appear on the equal footing , independently of which two - dimensional space ( world - sheet or space - time ) is primary .",
    "writing down the stringy vertex operator requires that the scalar field @xmath39 has a non - zero background charge , i.e. its central charge obeys @xmath90 .",
    "otherwise the integrand is not a primary world - sheet conformal field of dimension one .",
    "indeed , what happened is the anomaly cancelation between @xmath91 and @xmath47 .",
    "so it is clear that the construction fails for @xmath92 . in order to understand what to do ,",
    "there is a useful piece of background information we should review .",
    "first , let us recall that the @xmath93 affine lie algebra at the level @xmath94 admits the following representation @xmath95 we then take the space - time @xmath93 generators to be @xcite @xmath96 they obey the commutation relations of @xmath93 with @xmath97 .",
    "so there is a symmetry enhancement in space - time induced by a proper enhancement on the world - sheet at @xmath92 .",
    "however , the main moral of this story is that the central charge of affine algebras may have a topological origin !",
    "it seems interesting to develop such approach to affine algebras elsewhere .    _",
    "3.1.2 bosonization or conformal transformation in space - time . _",
    "the construction of section 2 has one drawback : it requires rational powers of the free field @xmath98 to describe the superconformal algebra sectors other than the neveu - schwarz sector . though examples of fractional calculus for the @xmath99 system are known in the literature ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) , it is more advantageous to use the bosonization procedure @xcite .",
    "the reason for this is that a special value for space - time dimension , i.e. @xmath100 , allows us to give a geometric interpretation of bosonization .",
    "the point of view we propose is the following .",
    "for a given @xmath98 which classically defines the embedding of the world - sheet into the space - time , we can take @xmath101 that is nothing but a conformal transformation to the cylindrical coordinates for space - time . on the other hand , within the quantized @xmath91 system such representation of @xmath98 is called as bosonization .",
    "thus , we can interpret the bosonization procedure as the quantum version of the conformal transformation to the cylindrical coordinates in space - time .    at this point , it only remains to illustrate the use of the cylindrical coordinates in the problem at hand .",
    "the general recipe of @xmath102 tells us to set @xmath103 where @xmath104 are the scalar fields with proper background charges and two - point functions normalized as @xmath105 .    combining all this",
    ", virasoro generators turn out to be @xmath106 a simple check shows that @xmath42 obey with @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , i.e. the result of subsection 2.1 is recovered .",
    "as regards the operator responsible for the topological charge , it is given by @xmath107 an important remark is that @xmath108 commutes with @xmath109 and @xmath98 , i.e. with all the @xmath46 and @xmath58 oscillators .",
    "in fact , this operator is equal to @xmath110 , so the number @xmath111 is called the `` bose - sea level '' of the representation of the @xmath112 algebra @xcite .    _ 3.1.3 sample calculations of space - time correlators .",
    "_ let us now move towards the world - sheet formulation of perturbative `` string '' theory . in general , physical theory",
    "is called string theory if it is formulated by an underlying world - sheet structure . what is best understood presently is the perturbative string theory in ten - dimensional minkowski space . in this case , the space - time scattering amplitudes in the momentum representation are given by the functional integral over all two - dimensional matter fields together with all the geometries of a two - dimensional surface with insertions of the appropriate vertex operators .",
    "it seems natural from the universality principle to follow the same ansatz .",
    "then it immediately comes to mind to define space - time correlators in the problem in hand .",

    "these actions are perturbed by @xmath116 with the coupling constant @xmath117 .",
    "@xmath118_p$ ] means that the @xmath119 system has the `` bose - sea level '' @xmath111 . as to @xmath120 and @xmath121 , they are space - time laurent modes and conformal dimensions , respectively .",
    "we define the measures of the path integrals so as to have the two - point functions @xmath122 , where @xmath123 is the `` bose - sea level '' .",
    "before we give examples of computations , we first want to make one important remark .",
    "the point is that the left - hand side of ansatz   is a correlator of a proper 2d conformal ( superconformal ) theory while a similar ansatz for string theory on ten - dimensional minkowski space gives scattering amplitudes of physical states .",
    "thus what is proposed is the stringy representation for conformal blocks of 2d conformal field theories .    in order to see how the ansatz works",
    "we will focus on the correlators of @xmath42 .",
    "these are , of course , rather simple .",
    "nevertheless , they contain some technical subtleties .",
    "in fact , modulo integrations over @xmath124 the right - hand side is a correlator of the free fields involved in the wakimoto representation of the @xmath125 wess - zumino - witten model . at present",
    "there are many ways to compute such correlators @xcite .",
    "the most famous ones are the so - called feigin - fuchs and dotsenko - fateev representations .",
    "since we do not know any conjugate representation of @xmath42 given by with @xmath49 , it is natural to make use of the feigin - fuchs representation . for such representation one",
    "has a trivial balance of charges for the free fields @xmath126 here @xmath127 is given by @xmath128 .",
    "the price for this simple balance is an additional number of screening operators that makes integral representation of conformal blocks more involved than it may be in the dotsenko - fateev representation with a charge asymmetry due to background charges .",
    "thus , we have the one - point function @xmath129 here @xmath111 means the `` bose - sea level '' of the representation of the @xmath130 algebra .",
    "now the balance of charges gives @xmath131 and the leading term in @xmath117 , i.e. @xmath132 .",
    "thus , the correlator becomes @xmath133 the correlator @xmath134 is zero because of the normal ordering of @xmath135 .",
    "alternatively , using a minimal substraction @xmath136 leads to @xmath137 , i.e. a space - time conformal theory has a non - trivial vacuum .",
    "however , the central charge is the same in both cases . ] . as a result",
    ", we have @xmath138 this means that a vacuum associated to a space - time conformal theory looks like the standard sl(2 ) invariant one .    next , let us go on to look at the two - point function @xmath139 the integration contours for @xmath140",
    "are shown in fig.1 .",
    "it is easy to see that the balance of charges and the integration over @xmath39 yield @xmath141 it is also not difficult to integrate @xmath46 away .",
    "this can be done by simply using the two - point function of @xmath99 .",
    "thus the correlator becomes @xmath142 the last correlator is computed in appendix b. so we may write @xmath143 in above we also set @xmath144 .",
    "now we come to the analysis of the integrals .",
    "obviously , the result depends on @xmath25 :    \\(i ) for @xmath145 , the integral over @xmath146 is equal to zero because the corresponding contour may be contracted to a point . as a result",
    ", the correlator vanishes .",
    "\\(ii ) for @xmath147 and @xmath148 , the contour @xmath149 with @xmath150 fixed can be deformed as shown in fig.2 , so the integral is given by the residue of the integrand .",
    "as a result , we have @xmath151 thus the central charge is given by @xmath50 , which is in agreement with the result of section 2 .    .",
    "]    for @xmath147 and @xmath152 , the integral over @xmath146 equals zero because the contour @xmath149 may be contracted to a point , so the correlator vanishes .",
    "\\(iii ) for @xmath153 , the analysis proceeds as in the above .",
    "indeed , this is the same as ( ii ) with @xmath154 .",
    "there are two main conclusions :    \\(a ) the proposed ansatz together with the corresponding normal ordering prescription reproduces the standard sl(2 ) invariant vacuum of space - time conformal field theory , namely @xmath155",
    ". moreover , it also provides the conjugate vacuum by ( iii ) with @xmath156 .",
    "eigenvalues of the topological charge @xmath108 have to be restricted to the fundamental region @xmath157 .",
    "\\(b ) there are no corrections to the central charge due to the perturbation term @xmath158 .",
    "however , it is expected that this term is relevant for the structure of space - time conformal theory .",
    "one example how it can be realized is known .",
    "we mean the deformation of the chiral algebra ( @xmath159 ) of 2d gravity coupled to @xmath160 matter @xcite . recall that such deformation appears due to the expansion over the cosmological term in the liouville action which is nothing but the screening operator for the virasoro algebra",
    "so , the only difference between these cases is the symmetry algebra on the world - sheet : virasoro for 2d gravity and @xmath11 in the case of interest .",
    "it is a straightforward matter of working out the multi - point functions @xmath161 and then deriving the ward identities .",
    "in fact , the latter requires repeating the procedure of  2 .",
    "let us conclude this subsection with a remark .",
    "the computations of section 2 are based on zero `` bose - sea level '' for the @xmath99 system . on the other hand ,",
    "we have used a non - zero level in this section .",
    "so the problem is to see what happens if we use a non - zero level for the computations of section 2 , i.e. we should check that the virasoro generators given by are correct . as in section 2",
    ", a simple algebra shows that such defined @xmath42 obey the virasoro commutation relations only for @xmath43 with @xmath44 .",
    "thus the definition of @xmath42 does not depend on the `` bose - sea level '' of the @xmath99 system .",
    "alternatively , this can be understood as follows . by using bosonization of the @xmath99 system",
    ", we represent the q - vacuum via the vertex operator at @xmath21 .",
    "it is well known that a vertex operator sitting at the origin does not affect the commutators of operators defined via contour integrals surrounding @xmath28 .    _",
    "3.1.4 @xmath162 limit .",
    "_ according to the maldacena conjecture @xcite , string theory on @xmath4 times a compact space is dual to a cft whose world - sheet is the boundary of @xmath4 .",
    "first let us clarify what the boundary is .",
    "starting with the metric on @xmath163 . ]",
    "@xmath164 the boundary consists of a copy of @xmath165 at @xmath166 , which in the @xmath167 coordinates corresponds to @xmath168 , together with a single point at @xmath169 , or @xmath170 .",
    "thus , in this representation , the boundary of @xmath4 is obtained by adding a point at infinity to @xmath165 , which is nothing but a sphere @xmath171 .",
    "one basic question we should ask is how to implement `` the boundary conditions '' in the path integral . to answer this question ,",
    "let us recall that the cft / ads correspondence is holographic in sense of @xcite .",

    "as it is shown in section 2 we can not define the generators of virasoro and @xmath0 algebras in a @xmath39-independent way but we can do so in the case of @xmath1 when @xmath39 drops out .- independent representation for stringy vertex operators that has been discussed in the literature on this subject [ 6 , 8 - 13 ] .",
    "] thus the holographic principle is in harmony with the maldacena conjecture that one should get exactly @xmath1 on the boundary !    _",
    "3.1.5 central charge multiplication .",
    "_ given the virasoro algebra with central charge @xmath172 , it is a simple thing to build the algebra with a central charge divisible by @xmath172 , i.e. @xmath173 , where @xmath174 is a positive integer .",
    "the actual relation is @xmath175 then we can write @xmath176 in terms of @xmath177 as @xmath178    this mechanism actually has the following interesting interpretation . what we had before was a map @xmath58:@xmath179 , i.e. a local embedding of the world - sheet into space - time .",
    "now let us define a covering map of @xmath180 on @xmath181 namely , @xmath182:@xmath183(a patch of @xmath184 ) .",
    "if the covering map takes the form @xmath185 , then eq . is nothing but the consequence of the transformation law of the stress - energy tensor under the analytic change of coordinates ( see @xcite ) .",
    "so we can rewrite @xmath176 as @xmath186 thus from the geometrical point of view the mechanism gives a short sequence of maps @xmath187 that is nothing but a particular case of the green s proposal `` world - sheets for world - sheets '' !",
    "of course we can immediately generalize the above mechanism for superalgebras .",
    "we will do this in the next subsection .      _",
    "3.2.1 more sample calculations of space - time correlators . _ first we want to see the world - sheet conformal invariance of vertices  .",
    "it immediately follows from the fact that their integrands have dimension one in @xmath84 . in other words , defining the virasoro generators on the world - sheet as @xmath188 where the dots mean extra contributions from @xmath39 and @xmath189 , we simply get that @xmath190 commutes with the generators .",
    "thus we have the stringy representation for the space - time @xmath1 superconformal algebra .",
    "now let us give some examples of calculations of space - time correlators .",
    "in doing so , for simplicity of exposition we restrict ourselves to the spherical topology and omit fields other than those used to define the @xmath1 generators .",
    "note that according to our discussion of the @xmath162 limit and holographic principle in subsection 3.1.4 , @xmath39 must be omitted .",

    "@xmath118_p$ ] means that the @xmath119 system has the `` bose - sea level '' @xmath111 .",
    "as regards @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath193 , they are space - time laurent modes , conformal dimensions and su(2)-spins , respectively .",
    "the measures in the path integrals are defined to have the two - point functions @xmath194 , where @xmath123 is the `` bose - sea level '' .",
    "of course , the free action @xmath192 may be perturbed as it was done earlier .",
    "one basic question we should now ask is what @xmath158 is .",
    "a possible solution is to take the screening operators of @xmath3 as the perturbation .",
    "fortunately , what saves the day is that the explicit form of @xmath158 is irrelevant for what follows .",
    "we will now carry out computations for the @xmath1 superalgebra using the above ansatz .",
    "let us again choose the representation a la feigin - fuchs with the following balance of charges @xmath195    the one - point functions can be evaluated to give @xmath196 where , just for simplicity , @xmath197 and @xmath198 .",
    "we use the same definition for normal ordering as in subsection 3.1.3 .",
    "so , the string vertices defined in this way lead to the standard ns vacuum of the space - time cft .",
    "next , let us go on to look at some two - point functions .",
    "the first example is @xmath199 . by using the balance and integrating over the free fields ,",
    "we can write it as @xmath200 to analyze the integrals we proceed as in subsection 3.1.3 . for @xmath201",
    "the result is @xmath202 that gives the central charge @xmath61 .    at this point",
    "it is natural to make a double check of the above result for @xmath172 . for this purpose ,",
    "let us compute @xmath203 .",
    "all computations proceed as before and result in @xmath204 where @xmath205 are positive integers .",
    "so , @xmath172 is again equal to @xmath206 .",
    "if instead of @xmath207 the two - point function is @xmath208 , then a simple algebra shows that for @xmath209 @xmath210 i.e. @xmath61 , which is the expected result .",
    "it is straightforward to find other two - point functions as well as n - point ones .    _",
    "3.2.2 the @xmath1 case , revisited .",
    "_ up to now our discussion of the @xmath1 superconformal algebra has been somewhat incomplete since the set of the free fields used to build generators is not exactly what one needs to construct the wakimoto free field representation of the @xmath3 algebra .",
    "so we can say that the underlying world - sheet algebra may be different .",
    "let us now fill this gap in our discussion .",
    "in doing so , we need to note just one point : for the particular set of the free fields that we are discussing here , we can define the following representation of the affine lie superalgebra @xmath3 at the level @xmath211 has @xmath212 with @xmath94 as a subalgebra , which makes it different from what is represented in appendix a. ] @xmath213 after this is done , the generators of @xmath1 are immediately written as @xmath214 thus @xmath3 is indeed the underlying world - sheet algebra .    to complete the story ,",
    "perhaps we should point out that can be regarded as one of the generalizations of the construction .    _",
    "3.2.3 ns fivebranes .",
    "_ according to the ads / cft correspondence , a cft whose world - sheet is the boundary of @xmath4 corresponds to the ir limit of the dynamics of parallel @xmath215 @xmath216-branes and @xmath217 @xmath218-branes that is mapped under s - duality into @xmath215 fundamental strings and @xmath217 ns5-branes .",
    "the central charge of this boundary cft is given by @xmath219 .",
    "one consequence of the construction of strings on @xmath4 is that @xmath25 measures the number of fundamental strings , i.e. @xmath220 . as to @xmath217 , it is identified with the level of the world - sheet algebra @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the latter does not seem natural from either the `` world - sheets for world - sheets '' standpoint or from the topological origin of central charges , so it is reasonable to ask how the situation can be improved . actually ,",
    "as we have noted at the end of subsection 3.1 , there is a nice way to do this .",
    "the intuitive idea is that @xmath221 .",
    "so , if @xmath61 then @xmath222 and @xmath174 is expected to be the number of ns5-branes .",
    "it is easy to see that the @xmath172 and @xmath223 generators of the @xmath1 superconformal algebra are related by @xmath224 thus in terms of the free fields the @xmath223 generators are @xmath225 from the geometrical point of view what we proposed is again a short sequence of maps @xmath226 where @xmath185 , which allows us to interpret ns5-branes as strings whose world - sheet is a manifold with the coordinates @xmath17 .",
    "first let us say a few words about the results .    in this work we have considered the possible application of postulates ( i)-(iii ) , as these",
    "are formulated in  1 , to superstring theory on @xmath4 . starting with a formal construction which lifts bosonized",
    "affine lie superalgebras on an arbitrary world - sheet to two - dimensional space - time we found rather amusing relations between space - time @xmath15 superconformal algebras and world - sheet superalgebras @xmath227 . next following the postulates , we applied this construction to superstring propagation on @xmath4 .",
    "we succeeded in describing the boundary @xmath1 algebra in terms of the `` boundary '' coordinates only , as postulate ( i ) requires , and in interpreting the central charge of this algebra in both `` primitive '' and topological ways , as postulates ( ii)-(iii ) require .",
    "we have also given a prescription for the calculation of space - time correlators .",
    "as an example , we computed the central charge via two - point functions .",
    "let us conclude by mentioning a few open problems together with interesting features of our discussion of string on @xmath4 .",
    "\\(i ) obviously , the most important open problem is to find the spectrum of the theory by solving the corresponding brst problem and establish unitarity .. so the problem is to give their stringy representation . ]",
    "unfortunately , it is unknown in general how to do this .",
    "most of the approaches have so far been based on the world - sheet @xmath228 symmetry algebra and its wakimoto representation .",
    "this may cause new problems because @xmath228 has no unitary representations @xcite .",
    "\\(ii ) from the mathematical point of view stringy representations of superconformal algebras are interesting in their own setting .",
    "these are not presented in the literature , so further work is needed to develop both the theory of such representations and their applications to conformal field theory .",
    "\\(iii ) it is interesting to note that @xmath1 is special because it provides the example where both the holographic principle and unitarity are simultaneously present .",
    "moreover , postulates ( ii)-(iii ) can be fitted in with this case .",
    "all that provides one more evidence that the ads / cft correspondence should make sense .",
    "\\(iv ) in our discussion of the `` world - sheets for world - sheets '' in section 3 a short sequence of maps @xmath229 requires one functional integration while the original procedure assumes one integration per map .",
    "so , it seems more natural to call it the simplified `` world - sheets for world - sheets '' rather than the green s `` worlds - sheets for world - sheets '' .",
    "\\(v ) the construction of the stringy representations of superalgebras or , strings on @xmath4 as a special case , is strongly reminiscent of the non - critical string theory in sense that both of them have two - dimensional space - time .",
    "however , the difference is in how the corresponding embedding of the world - sheet is implemented . in the first case it is done by the first order systems that is natural from both the geometrical point of view and as regards the manifest supersymmetry in space - time . as to the second ,",
    "it is realized by the scalar fields .",
    "nevertheless , these constructions should have relations .",
    "some similarities have been noticed in @xcite .",
    "however more work is needed to determine a precise relation .",
    "i heard about the green s `` world - sheets for world - sheets '' during my visit to ecole normale suprieure in 1996 - 1997 .",
    "i am indebted to j .- l.gervais for stimulating discussions of this nice idea .",
    "i am also grateful b. feigin , r. metsaev and a. rosly for useful discussions , and a. semikhatov for reading the manuscript .",
    "this research was supported in part by the european community grant intas - open-97 - 1312 .",
    "in this appendix we will briefly recall basic facts on some affine lie superalgebras and their free field representations .",
    "all superalgebras have @xmath230 as a subalgebra that makes them different from what can usually be found in the literature ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .      as a preparation for",
    "the discussion of superalgebras in later subsections , let us begin with the affine lie algebra @xmath11 .",
    "in the case of @xmath231 the algebra consists of 3 bosonic currents required to obey the following operator product expansions @xmath232 where @xmath233 is the level , @xmath234 .",
    "it is well - known that the wakimoto free field representation is described in terms of one free boson @xmath39 coupled to a background charge and a first order bosonic @xmath130 system of weight @xmath235 .",
    "the two - point functions of the free fields are normalized as @xmath236 the currents are given by @xmath237 with @xmath144 .",
    "one can use the sugawara construction , namely @xmath238 to determine the virasoro algebra with the central charge @xmath239 .    moreover , with the aid of eq .",
    ", @xmath240 can be written as @xmath241    finally , let us note that we can write some free fields in terms of the currents @xmath242      the simplest affine superalgebra @xmath2 is obtained from the algebra @xmath11 by incorporating fermionic currents @xmath244 .",
    "thus the op expansions are extended to @xmath245 with @xmath246 ; @xmath247 , @xmath248 , where @xmath78 is the antisymmetric tensor with @xmath249 ; and the tensors @xmath80 are in the representation @xmath250 .",
    "this time the wakimoto free field representation is described in terms of one free boson @xmath39 coupled to a background charge and a pair of first order systems @xmath130 and @xmath251 of weights @xmath235 .",
    "the two - point function of the free fermions is normalized as @xmath252 the currents are given by @xmath253 where @xmath254 .    for @xmath2",
    ", the sugawara stress tensor @xmath255 gives the virasoro algebra with the central charge @xmath256 .    in terms of the free fields @xmath240",
    "is given by @xmath257    finally , let us note that we can also write some free fields via the currents as @xmath258      the next affine superalgebra to consider is @xmath3 .",
    "it is obtained from from the algebra @xmath2 by incorporating fermionic currents @xmath260 as well as one bosonic current @xmath261 .",
    "we take the defining op expansions to be @xmath245 where @xmath262 ; @xmath263 ; @xmath76 .",
    "this time @xmath78 is the antisymmetric tensor with @xmath264 ; and the tensors @xmath80 are in the representation @xmath265 , @xmath266 , @xmath267 .",
    "moreover , @xmath268 .    the wakimoto free field representation is described in terms of a pair of free bosons @xmath269 without background charges and a set of first order systems @xmath130 , @xmath251 and @xmath270 of weights @xmath235 .",
    "the two - point functions of the free fields are normalized as @xmath271    for the bosonized currents , we take @xmath272 where @xmath273 .    for @xmath3 , the sugawara stress tensor @xmath274 gives the virasoro algebra with the central charge @xmath275 .",
    "in particular from one deduces the following @xmath276    to complete the specification of the free field representation , let us note that some free fields may be expressed in terms of the currents as    @xmath277",
    "the purpose of this appendix is to compute the correlator @xmath279 .",
    "there are a variety of ways to do this . in general the technique of @xcite",
    "allows us to compute the correlator for any complex @xmath280 within the @xmath99 system with @xmath281 .",
    "of course , it can be generalized to nonzero @xmath282 .",
    "however , it seems more natural to make use of bosonization in this case . if we begin with the bosonization recipe , then @xmath283 will be simply @xmath284 on the other hand , for the q - vacuum , the corresponding vertex operator is given by @xmath285 we again use the feigin - fuchs representation where the background charges are taken into account via screening operators .",
    "in general , this technique is rather involved to be used in string theory because it leads to integral representations of correlators but for the problem at hand it works perfectly ( one needs no screening operators ) .",
    "the correlator is written as @xmath286 where @xmath287 means the conjugate vacuum .",
    "a simple algebra gives @xmath288    to convince the reader , let us give an alternative derivation .",
    "it follows from the definition of the q - vacuum that @xmath289 .",
    "the last correlator is an analytic function of @xmath290 in the entire complex plane , so it is constant . to find this constant , note that @xmath291",
    "thus we recover the result ."
