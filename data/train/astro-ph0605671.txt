    "ic  342 , a late - type spiral galaxy ( scd ) , is one of the closest galaxies to the milky way , located only @xmath3  3.3  mpc away @xcite ( 1  corresponds to 16  pc ) .",
    "the physical properties of its molecular clouds , its infrared luminosity , and the presence of a nuclear stellar cluster @xcite make ic  342 similar to the milky way in many ways . because of its proximity to the galactic equator , ic  342 is a faint optical source . however , it is a very rich source of molecular emission , and has been studied in numerous molecular tracers .",
    "furthermore , ic  342 is nearly face - on , minimizing line broadening due to galactic rotation , thereby maximizing line intensity .",
    "this orientation makes ic  342 useful for milky way - like studies .",
    "ic  342 has a high concentration of molecular gas within the inner 1  kpc , especially within 250  pc of the nucleus @xcite .",
    "inflow along a large - scale stellar bar @xcite has been proposed to explain the large quantity of gas in the nucleus .",
    "an s - shaped bar in the molecular gas ( the `` mini - spiral '' ) , has been clearly detected in the nuclear region in co(1 - 0 ) @xcite as well as in nir observations @xcite .",
    "the mini - spiral is oriented in the north - south direction , and it is apparently unrelated to the spiral arms located further out in the disk @xcite .",
    "the two arms of the mini - spiral meet in a ring composed of dense gas @xcite .",
    "this ring , @xmath3 4  in radius , surrounds a central stellar cluster that occupies the central 80  pc of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "the central stellar cluster is non - axisymmetric , with a north - south elongation , which is believed to be caused by the presence of a nuclear stellar bar with a major axis diameter of @xmath3  13@xcite .",
    "the nuclear bar creates the ring - like structure at 4  , an inner lindblad resonance ( ilr ) @xcite . inside the ring ,",
    "the abundance decreases for all the molecular tracers studied to date @xcite .",
    "current star formation activity in the nucleus of ic  342 is dominated by two bright hii regions @xmath3 4west and east of the nuclear cluster .",
    "these star formation regions are @xmath3  5  myr old",
    ". the central cluster , which is composed of young and massive supergiants , does not show evidence for current star formation @xcite .",
    "high - resolution hcn(1 - 0 ) studies by @xcite have shown the presence of five giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) in ic  342 ( gmcs a , b , c , d , and e ) . these gmcs have sizes from 20 to 40 pc , masses of @xmath3@xmath9 m@xmath10 and average molecular densities of @xmath11 @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "each gmc appears to be composed of multiple small , dense clouds @xcite , which have densities of @xmath3  10@xmath12  @xmath6 @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite have shown that the distribution of gmcs extends close to the nucleus ( within a distance of 100  pc ) and well inside the tidal limit .",
    "the region occupied by these gmcs includes both the arms of the mini - spiral and the ring .",
    "gmcs a , b and c are located in the central ring , whereas gmcs d and e are in the northern arm and southern arm of the mini - spiral , respectively .",
    "gmcs b and c are situated where the arms of the mini - spiral meet the ring , and may be related to the young star formation regions found there ( the two hii regions mentioned above ) .",
    "high - resolution studies of c@xmath13o by @xcite show that gmc b is the warmest gmc in the central region .",
    "gmc a is the closest to the nucleus , but it does not show strong star formation .",
    "gmc d also does not show strong star formation , although it is located alongside the northern arm where @xcite detected large quantities of molecular gas with inward motions .",
    "gmc n , as noted by @xcite , is located close to gmcs a and b , in the molecular ring .",
    "it has only been detected in nitrogen bearing molecules .",
    "the gmcs are very warm , with a temperature of 50 to 70  k measured using hcn(1 - 0 ) ( @xcite )",
    ". however , more recent co(2 - 1 ) observations by @xcite have shown that most of the gas within the gmcs has a temperature of only 10 - 20  k. this cool gas is surrounded by much hotter photon dominated regions ( pdrs ) with temperatures that reach 50  k. the ionization of the pdrs may be produced by the central nuclear cluster , rather than by the hii regions close to gmcs b and c @xcite .",
    "the gmcs associated with the nucleus of ic  342 have been the subject of numerous molecular line studies .",
    "however , few observations have been made in the rotation inversion transitions of nh@xmath0 .",
    "nh@xmath0 is a good probe of the physical conditions in molecular clouds for many reasons .",
    "the large number of transitions concentrated around @xmath31.3  cm means that multiple ammonia lines can be detected with the same receiver on the same telescope , thereby circumventing cross calibration problems .",
    "moreover , measuring two emission lines allows us to calculate the rotational temperature of the gas @xcite .",
    "also , due to its high dipole moment , a density of @xmath3 10@xmath14 @xmath6 is necessary to excite nh@xmath0 , making it an excellent high - density gas tracer .    the first detection of extragalactic nh@xmath0 emission was made in ic 342 by @xcite using the 100 m effelsberg telescope of the max - plank - institut fr radioastronomie .",
    "numerous studies , both with interferometers and single - dish antennas , have been carried out since then in ic  342 @xcite , as well as in other galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , the only previous study of nh@xmath0(6,6 ) in ic  342 was made by @xcite using the 100 m effelsberg telescope .",
    "this study detected the presence of warm gas ( @xmath4  150  k ) in the center of ic  342 .",
    "in particular , they found a high abundance of nh@xmath0(6,6 ) ( n@xmath15  =  3.2  @xmath2  10@xmath16  @xmath17 ) , which has an excitation energy above ground of 412  k. this study also suggested the presence of multiple components with different temperatures within the beam .",
    "however , due to the large beam ( 38  for nh@xmath0(6,6 ) ) for these single - dish data , the multiple components could not be separated .",
    "we have conducted a study of nh@xmath0(6,6 ) using the vla in order to resolve the structure of the hot dense gas in the nucleus of ic  342 .",
    "our interferometric observations produce a much smaller beam ( 7.8   @xmath2   5.0  ) , allowing us to separate the emission from different structures present in the nucleus of ic  342 .",
    "in addition to studying the molecular structure of the ic  342 nuclear region , we also relate our data to the center of the milky way .",
    "as previously mentioned , ic  342 is a perfect candidate for milky way - like studies .",
    "interferometric observations of nh@xmath0(6,6 ) at the galactic center have shown that there is a large concentration of high density hot gas surrounding sgr  a * @xcite .",
    "therefore , the study of the nuclear region of ic  342 is not only important in itself , but it also provides an excellent opportunity to investigate the same processes that take place in our own galactic center .",
    "observations of nh@xmath0(6,6 ) ( @xmath18  =  25.056025  ghz ) were made with the nrao very large array ( vla@xmath1 ) in the d configuration on 2003 february 15 and 16 .",
    "the pointing was centered on @xmath19  =  03@xmath2046@xmath2148.7@xmath22 , @xmath23  =  680546.7  .",
    "the data consisted of a 25 mhz bandwidth divided into 15 spectral channels with a velocity resolution of 9.3  km  s@xmath24 .",
    "the velocity coverage was from -30  km  s@xmath24 to + 110  km  s@xmath24 , centered on _",
    "v_@xmath25  =  40  km  s@xmath24 .",
    "channels 1 , 14 and 15 were removed from the data because of low sensitivity due to the roll off in the passband response .",
    "channels 2 and 3 were used for continuum subtraction , which was performed in the uv plane , thus resulting in an effective velocity coverage from 0  km  s@xmath24 to 90  km  s@xmath24 . the fact that the continuum subtraction has been performed",
    "using channels from only one side of the line does not affect the final result since the bandpass was calibrated by observing 0319 + 415 ( 3c84 ) .",
    "the data were calibrated using the nrao astronomical imaging processing system ( aips ) .",
    "the total on - source integration time was @xmath37  hours .",
    "the flux calibrator was 0137 + 331 ( 3c48 ) with an assumed flux of 0.99 jy at 1.3  cm .",
    "the phase calibrator was 0228 + 673 , with a measured flux of 1.04  @xmath26  0.01  jy .",
    "we performed phase - only self - calibration to correct for atmospheric fluctuations on short time - scales .",
    "the self - calibration was done on the broadband continuum data ( the average of the inner 75% of the 25 mhz window ) , and the results were applied to the line data .",
    "final deconvolution was performed using imagr .",
    "the overall improvement in rms noise due to self - calibration was about a factor of 2 .",
    "the final rms noise per channel is 0.3  mjy  beam@xmath24 and the overall achieved rms sensitivity is 3.6  mjy  beam@xmath24  km  s@xmath24 .",
    "natural weighting of the uv data produced an image with a synthesized beam of 7.8  x 5.0  with a position angle of 64 .",
    "the integrated intensity map was produced using the momnt task with a minimum flux cutoff of 0.4  mjy .",
    "the absolute positional accuracy is limited by phase noise , and is on the order of 1  .",
    "we detect and resolve the extended nh@xmath0(6,6 ) emission from ic  342 ( figure [ cont.fig ] ) .",
    "three line emission peaks are clearly visible in our results , marked by numbers 1 - 3 on figure [ cont.fig ] .",
    "peaks 1 and 2 appear to be embedded in a single , extended molecular structure .",
    "the third peak , which has not been previously observed in any molecular tracer , is isolated .",
    "comparing the line emission map with the continuum map ( in contours and false colors , respectively , in figure [ cont.fig ] ) , we find that peak 2 corresponds to the continuum emission peak , which marks the location of a strong heating source as well as the nucleus of ic  342 @xcite . throughout this paper , peak 1 will be referred to as the _ ( 6,6 ) peak _ , peak 2 as the _ continuum peak _ , and peak 3 as the _ west peak_.    we compared our nh@xmath0(6,6 ) flux with the single - dish data from @xcite . because the beam size for the 100 m effelsberg telescope is 38 ",
    ", all three of our nh@xmath0(6,6 ) peaks are well within the effelsberg beam . from @xcite ,",
    "the single - dish flux is 4.5  @xmath2  10@xmath27  jy  beam@xmath24 , while the sum of the fluxes detected for the three nh@xmath0(6,6 ) peaks presented in this paper is 4.6  @xmath2  10@xmath27  jy  beam@xmath24 .",
    "therefore , there is no missing flux , and all emission detected in the single - dish data must originate in clouds with size scales smaller than @xmath28 .    because the relative locations of the nh@xmath0(6,6 ) emission peaks and the gmcs may provide a clue to the behavior of material near the nucleus of ic  342 , we overlay the positions of the 6 gmcs on our nh@xmath0(6,6 ) map ( gmcs a , b , c , d , e and n in figure [ positions.fig ] ) .",
    "we plot the spectra at the positions of our three peaks and the 6 gmcs . for comparison ,",
    "we also plot spectra taken from three random , emission - free positions ( figure [ spectra.fig ] ) .    in order to investigate the physical conditions in the nh@xmath0(6,6 )",
    "clouds that we observe , we also compare our nh@xmath0(6,6 ) map to hnc(1 - 0 ) , hc@xmath0n(10 - 9 ) , n@xmath7h@xmath8(1 - 0 ) @xcite , co(1 - 0 ) @xcite , and co(2 - 1 ) @xcite .",
    "we have chosen these five molecular lines for different reasons .",
    "hnc , hc@xmath0n and n@xmath7h@xmath8 have proved to be high - density tracers .",
    "moreover , these molecules are nitrogen bearing like nh@xmath0 . comparing the results from hc@xmath0n , hnc and n@xmath7h@xmath8 with nh@xmath0",
    ", we can determine whether gmc n is also an emission peak in nh@xmath0 .",
    "co is second only to h@xmath7 in terms of abundance in the interstellar medium .",
    "however , h@xmath7 can not be directly studied because of the lack of a dipole moment .",
    "we compare our nh@xmath0(6,6 ) data to co(2 - 1 ) and ( 1 - 0 ) , which , because of their low excitation requirements , are the molecular tracers that detect more extended emission in ic  342 .",
    "most of the co(1 - 0 ) emission comes from the extended ridges of the mini - spiral , but not directly from the gmcs embeded in it @xcite .",
    "in contrast , co(2 - 1 ) , at twice the excitation above ground , is detected in warmer gas than co(1 - 0 ) . as mentioned before , @xcite have found most of the gas inside the gmcs to be colder than the gas outside of them , since the gmcs are surrounded by pdrs .",
    "thus , it is not surprising that the warmer co(2 - 1 ) is detected in the thin outer layers of the gmcs where they are heated from outside by uv photons @xcite .",
    "therefore , the comparison with nh@xmath0(6,6 ) could provide some clue as to the kind of gas traced by this highly excited transition .",
    "we expect to find nh@xmath0(6,6 ) concentrated in the areas where co(1 - 0 ) is weaker and inside the gmcs traced by co(2 - 1 ) .",
    "a gas distribution of this sort would reflect the fact that nh@xmath0 is optically thin , while co is optically thick , and that the gas distribution depends on density .",
    "therefore , even though the hotter co has been detected outside of the gmcs instead of inside , we expect the optically thin and dense nh@xmath0 to be found well inside the gmcs .",
    "because the different molecular lines have been measured using different telescopes , we have resampled the maps with the same size pixels , in order to allow a proper registration for direct comparison .",
    "we did not convolve the maps , choosing to keep the full resolution of each map",
    ". however , most of the maps we use for comparison in fact have a very similar angular resolution to our data .",
    "we use the latest hnc(1 - 0 ) , hc@xmath0n(10 - 9 ) and n@xmath7h@xmath8(1 - 0 ) results from @xcite .",
    "these three molecular lines have been measured using the owens valley radio observatory ( ovro ) and have an angular resolution of 5 - 6  with a positional accuracy of @xmath3 1  .",
    "the co(2 - 1 ) map by @xcite was also made using ovro , but the angular resolution is 1.2  with a positional uncertainty of less than 0.1  . matching the angular resolution of co(2 - 1 ) to our nh@xmath0 data was not useful because the detected structures would be smoothed away .",
    "co(1 - 0 ) has been measured using the berkeley - illinois - maryland array ( bima ) together with the 12 m nrao antenna @xcite .",
    "the angular resolution of 5.6  is similar to the resolution of our vla data .",
    "the co(1 - 0 ) data have a positional accuracy of @xmath3 0.4  .",
    "only the co(1 - 0 ) data include short spacing information , and are thus sensitive to large - scale structure .",
    "therefore , the flux associated with the other molecular tracers must be assumed to be a lower limit .",
    "the lack of short spacings does not appear to be as important for nh@xmath0(6,6 ) as there is no missing flux as compared to single - dish measurements .",
    "nevertheless , some caution must be applied to detailed comparisons between molecules .    in order to understand the significance of the _ west peak _ , which is not detected in any of the other molecular lines",
    ", we also compare our results to a 6  cm continuum map from the vla ( c .- w .",
    "tsai , private communication ) ( figure [ 6cm.fig ] ) .",
    "the 6  cm continuum peak appears spatially coincident with our 1.3  cm continuum map ( figure [ cont_cont.fig ] ) .",
    "therefore , we are confident that the features we observe in nh@xmath0(6,6 ) are well placed in comparison with the 6  cm map , i.e. the positional accuracy is reliable",
    ".    finally , it would be very useful to compare the nh@xmath0(6,6 ) emission to emission from other metastable transitions of nh@xmath0 .",
    "comparing our nh@xmath0(6,6 ) map with the nh@xmath0(1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) maps by @xcite we find that , in general , the detected features on the three maps are remarkably different . since the lower excitation lines are sensitive to colder gas , the nh@xmath0(1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) maps appear to trace the more extended emission , such as the mini - spiral , and gmc d. however , the emission in these lower lines seems to `` avoid '' the position where the _ continuum peak _ is located , whereas the nh@xmath0(6,6 ) emission is very strong in that location .",
    "@xcite associated the weakness of nh@xmath0(1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) toward the continuum source either with photoionization or high temperatures present in the nuclear region .",
    "because of the detection of nh@xmath0(6,6 ) , which is at 412  k above ground , the second scenario is indeed the most plausible explanation .",
    "more recent results in nh@xmath0(1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) are consistent with the earlier results ( m. lebrn , private communication ) .",
    "below , we discuss the three nh@xmath0(6,6 ) peaks in turn .",
    "when comparing the nh@xmath0(6,6 ) map with the positions of the gmcs , we notice that the _ ( 6,6 ) peak _ is remarkably close to gmc c ( figure [ positions.fig ] ) .",
    "the two positions are in fact coincident to within the absolute positional uncertainties of the nh@xmath0 map .",
    "we conclude that the _ ( 6,6 ) peak _ and gmc c are likely the same structure .",
    "previous studies have demonstrated that the strongest star formation areas in the central region of ic  342 are gmcs b and c , which are both located where the arms meet the ring .",
    "therefore , nh@xmath0(6,6 ) traces areas where the star formation activity has been enhanced .",
    "the hc@xmath0n(10 - 9 ) emission from @xcite has a structure similar to that of the nh@xmath0(6,6 ) emission ( figure [ hc3n.fig ] ) . in both maps ,",
    "the strongest line emission is found at the position of the _",
    "( 6,6 ) peak_. we compare the line profiles detected in hc@xmath0n(10 - 9 ) by @xcite with that in nh@xmath0(6,6 ) at the position of the gmc that is closer to our detected peak ( gmc c ) and we find that they have very similar velocities .",
    "thus hc@xmath0n(10 - 9 ) and nh@xmath0(6,6 ) appear to trace the same high - density , high - temperature material .    when comparing the nh@xmath0(6,6 )",
    "results with those from the hnc(1 - 0 ) map by @xcite we find that the emission of the gmc close to the position of the _ ( 6,6 ) peak _ ( gmc c ) is weaker than the emission arising from another region of the map ( figure 5 ) .",
    "the different behavior might indicate that hnc(1 - 0 ) is a density tracer while nh@xmath0(6,6 ) is a better temperature tracer .",
    "in fact , @xcite note that hnc is more strongly detected in areas of high volume density , not only high column density .",
    "the distribution of n@xmath7h@xmath8(1 - 0 ) is very similar to that of hnc(1 - 0 ) ( figure [ n2h+.fig ] ) , although the n@xmath7h@xmath8(1 - 0 ) emission is slightly more extended towards the north , tracing the northern arm of the mini - spiral .",
    "the n@xmath7h@xmath8(1 - 0 ) emission peaks at the location of gmc n , which is not close to the _ ( 6,6 ) peak _ ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "n@xmath7h@xmath8 is believed to trace dense quiescent gas @xcite .",
    "the lack of coincidence between the n@xmath7h@xmath8(1 - 0 ) and the nh@xmath0(6,6 ) maps indicates that the ion is tracing the areas where the star formation seems to be less intense or non - existent , while the nh@xmath0(6,6 ) is present in active star formation regions .",
    "the _ ( 6,6 ) peak _ coincides with the co(2 - 1 ) peak measured by @xcite ( figure [ co21.fig ] ) .",
    "the co(2 - 1 ) traces the eastern and western parts of the two molecular spiral arms where they form the molecular ring .",
    "the nh@xmath0(6,6 ) appears to extend outside of the eastern arm , but the spatial coincidence is excellent when the different angular resolutions of the two data - sets are considered .",
    "this coincidence of nh@xmath0(6,6 ) and co(2 - 1 ) suggests that the gaseous material flowing inwards along the northern arm of the `` mini - spiral '' is interacting with the inner ring , heating gmc c , and therefore producing the co(2 - 1 ) emission .",
    "this interaction may also be triggering a burst of star formation at the same location .    like in the co(2 - 1 ) map , the nh@xmath0 _ ( 6,6 ) peak _ appears to be offset by 1  to the se as compared to the co(1 - 0 ) map by @xcite ( figure [ co10.fig ] ) . in this case , the angular resolutions of the two maps are similar .",
    "the slight offset may not be significant given the absolute positional error of about 1  .",
    "the co(1 - 0 ) traces the more extended and colder gas that forms the s - shaped bar , whereas the nh@xmath0(6,6 ) is more compact and detects the warmer material accumulated in the regions where the inflow from the bar meets the inner ring .",
    "however , the nh@xmath0(6,6 ) and the co(1 - 0 ) maps do seem to be well - correlated , since both main peaks are detected .",
    "when comparing the nh@xmath0(6,6 ) map with the 6  cm continuum map , we find that the _ ( 6,6 ) peak _ appears at the edge of the 6  cm continuum emission ( figure [ 6cm.fig ] ) .",
    "the 6  cm emission seems to have a `` tail '' that ends at the position of the _",
    "( 6,6 ) peak_. however , there is no evidence for a diffuse continuum component in this area . @xcite and @xcite found that the 6  cm continuum map of the center of ic  342 was mainly dominated by free - free thermal emission .",
    "however , in the northern part of the cnd where the _ ( 6,6 ) peak _ is located , the emission was mostly from synchrotron origin . thus , there is synchrotron emission associated with the _ ( 6,6 ) peak _ , but not with its surrondings .",
    "a possible explanation for these observations could be that the _ ( 6,6 ) peak _ is located in the position of a very concentrated burst of star formation that has developed some supernovae , but no such activity has taken place outside of this position .    in summary ,",
    "the presence of a strong star formation region where the _ ( 6,6 ) peak _ is located , and a comparison of the nh@xmath0(6,6 ) distribution with other molecular lines , suggest that the _ ( 6,6 ) peak _ has the characteristics of a column density and temperature peak .",
    "the nh@xmath0(6,6 ) _ continuum peak _ is offset by 2-3  from gmcs b , a and n , which trace an arc around it ( figure [ positions.fig ] ) .",
    "this offset appears significant , especially since the nh@xmath0(6,6 ) _ continuum peak _ coincides well with the 6  cm continuum peak ( figure [ 6cm.fig ] ) .",
    "when comparing gmc b and the _ continuum peak _ spectra , we notice that even though the _ continuum peak _ spectrum is stronger , the integrated intensity is very similar . as remarked before , gmc b is a very strong star formation area . on the other hand",
    ", no trace of star formation has been detected towards gmc  a to date .",
    "the lack of a strong nh@xmath0(6,6 ) detection at the position of gmc  a supports the theory that there is no current star formation in this region .",
    "gmc a has a nh@xmath0(6,6 ) spectrum only slightly more intense than the background emission - free spots ( figure [ spectra.fig ] ) .",
    "we do not find a differentiated feature in the integrated intensity map where gmc n should be .",
    "however , the spectrum at this position is clearly above noise - level .",
    "the hc@xmath0n(10 - 9 ) map from @xcite shows a peak near the _ continuum peak _",
    "( figure [ hc3n.fig ] ) . as in the nh@xmath0(6,6 )",
    "map , the _ continuum peak _ seems weaker than the _ ( 6,6 ) peak_. since gmc b , which seems to be the gmc closer to the _ continuum peak _ , is the warmest region of the nucleus of ic  342 , the fact that nh@xmath0(6,6 ) and hc@xmath0n(10 - 9 ) are weaker at this point may suggest that the total column density is not a maximum at this position .",
    "the _ continuum peak _ is offset by 2  north of the secondary peak in hc@xmath0n(10 - 9 ) and the primary peak detected in hnc(1 - 0 ) by @xcite ( figure [ hnc.fig ] ) .",
    "this offset appears to be significant . a similar offset between nh@xmath0(6,6 ) and n@xmath7h@xmath8(1 - 0 ) is also observed .",
    "these results suggest that neither hc@xmath0n(10 - 9 ) nor hnc(1 - 0 ) nor n@xmath7h@xmath8(1 - 0 ) are tracing a temperature peak , which is in fact better traced by nh@xmath0(6,6 ) .",
    "the _ continuum peak _ is a very weak feature in the co(2 - 1 ) map @xcite . unlike nh@xmath0(6,6 ) , co(2 - 1 ) does not detect the gas associated with the heating source located at the _ continuum peak _ , but instead traces the gas surrounding it ( figure [ co21.fig ] ) .",
    "the _ continuum peak _ also appears offset by 3  from the secondary peak detected in the co(1 - 0 ) map by @xcite ( figure [ co10.fig ] ) .",
    "as in the nh@xmath0(6,6 ) map , this secondary peak is weaker than the one that coincides with the _ ( 6,6 ) peak _ , and although the kind of gas traced by the two molecules have different temperatures , the overall structure has some similarities .",
    "finally , as expected , the _ continuum peak _ is located close to the 6  cm continuum emission peak ( figure [ 6cm.fig ] ) .",
    "the 6  cm continuum emission seems to trace an arc structure around the nh@xmath0(6,6 ) _ continuum peak _ rather than being concentrated at that same spot . in this case",
    ", the angular resolution is different by a factor of 10 . with higher resolution , the nh@xmath0(6,6 )",
    "emission could be even better correlated with the 6  cm continuum structure .",
    "the good correspondence with the radio continuum peak , and the offset of a few arcseconds relative to other molecular peaks which sample lower temperature gas , suggests that the nh@xmath0(6,6 ) emission could be tracing a hot molecular component near the nucleus .",
    "@xcite suggest that the nucleus of ic  342 has two different molecular mass components , a cold and dense component , which represents about one third of the total molecular mass , and a less dense and hotter component .",
    "a similar situation has also been observed in the center of the milky way . by looking at six nh@xmath0 metatestable inversion transitions ( from ( 1,1 ) to ( 6,6 ) ) in the galactic center region",
    "( 575  pc  @xmath2  145  pc ) , @xcite find the distribution of the transition lines to differ from one another .",
    "while lower transition lines look similar , the higher transitions often look very different .",
    "in fact , @xcite find that molecular gas in the nuclear region of the galaxy is best modeled as a mixture of hot ( @xmath3  200  k ) and cold ( 25  k ) gas , in which 75@xmath29 of the gas is in the cold component .",
    "this `` two - temperature '' structure continues to hold even within 5  pc of the nucleus @xcite .",
    "furthermore , studies by @xcite , with a similar velocity resolution to ours , find nh@xmath0(6,6 ) to be clearly concentrated in the nucleus of the milky way .",
    "obviously , the galactic center study refers to a much more concentrated and less massive material than the material detected in ic  342 , given the different size - scales ( 2.7  kpc  @xmath2  4.8  kpc for ic  342 , 10  pc  @xmath2  10  pc for the galactic center ) .",
    "therefore , the mechanism that drives the nh@xmath0(6,6 ) in the nuclear region of ic  342 , which is likely to be a star formation process , might be more extensive spatially than the mechanism that is working in the galactic center . nevertheless , given the similar behaviour we find in the nuclear regions of ic  342 and the galactic center , this suggests that the _ continuum peak _ could be tracing the hot component present in the nucleus of ic  342 , i.e. the _ continuum peak _ is a temperature peak .",
    "the _ west peak _ has no counterpart in any other molecular line map that has been published to date .",
    "however , the careful reduction process that we have used gives us confidence to conclude that this structure is not a noise feature .",
    "in addition , the lack of a symmetric counterpart on the other side of the nucleus of ic  342 leads us to conclude that the _ west peak _ is unlikely a sidelobe effect .",
    "west peak _ is not very strong , but it is a remarkable feature because it is detected over a wide velocity range .",
    "we compare the _",
    "west peak _ spectrum to three randomly chosen noise - level spectra in figure [ spectra.fig ] .",
    "we find that , although weak , the overall flux level associated with the _",
    "west peak _ is above the noise level .",
    "the comparison of the nh@xmath0(6,6 ) emission map with the latest vla 6  cm continuum emission map from ch .- w .",
    "tsai ( a and c configurations combined ) shows no evidence of radiocontinuum emission at this location ( figure [ 6cm.fig ] ) .",
    "the presence of nh@xmath0(6,6 ) at positions where there have been no previous molecular detections has occurred elsewhere . in the milky way ,",
    "nh@xmath0(6,6 ) has been detected within 2  pc of the galactic center with no corresponding emission from other molecular tracers @xcite .",
    "this molecular emission ( termed the `` high - line - ratio - cloud '' ) is thought to be the result of absorption of low - energy transitions ( in particular nh@xmath0(1,1 ) , ( 2,2 ) and ( 3,3 ) ) by cool material along the line - of - sight @xcite .",
    "though the size scale of the galactic center emission ( @xmath30  2  pc ) is much smaller than the size scales traced in our ic  342 data , it is possible that a similar geometrical effect could explain the lack of low - energy molecular emission associated with the ic  342 _ west peak_.      since we have detected three different peaks , we separate the nh@xmath0(6,6 ) structure into three different areas and calculate the mass in each .    because we have only measured one transition line , nh@xmath0(6,6 ) , we can not directly calculate the excitation temperature of the gas .",
    "theoretically , the nh@xmath0(6,6 ) opacity could be measured using the hyperfine splitting of the nh@xmath0(6,6 ) emission line . however , due to the weakness of the satellite lines ( roughly 3% of the main hyperfine line for optically thin gas ) and the large linewidths , this calculation is not possible for our data .",
    "we therefore assume optically thin emission ( @xmath31  @xmath32  1 ) and also consider the source to fill the clean beam giving @xmath33    we can obtain the t@xmath34 directly from the line profile , using @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the wavelength , k is boltzmann s constant , @xmath37 the solid angle and s@xmath38 is the peak flux density .    the column density is calculated using @xmath39 for nh@xmath0(6,6 ) , k@xmath15  =  0.969 , a@xmath40  =  3.38  @xmath2  10@xmath41  s@xmath24 , and @xmath18  =  25.056  ghz @xcite .",
    "once we know the value of the column density , we obtain the molecular mass through the following equation : @xmath42~\\times~m_{h_2}}~,\\ ] ] where f@xmath15 is the fraction of nh@xmath0 molecules in the ( 6,6 ) state , and is on the order of 0.1 for temperatures higher than 150  k. we use @xmath43  =  10@xmath44 from @xcite , which is the relative abundance of h@xmath7 to nh@xmath0 in fairly warm environments ( t  @xmath4  150  k ) .    the resulting mass estimates for each nh@xmath0(6,6 )",
    "peak are given in table 1 .",
    "we detect a total warm gas mass of 8.2  @xmath2  10@xmath12  m@xmath10 , clearly much larger than the amount of warm gas mass detected in the interior of the galactic center circumnuclear disk by @xcite , 10@xmath5  m@xmath10 ( inner 1.5  pc around sgr  a * ) .",
    "@xcite reported a warm mass of 5.0  @xmath2  10@xmath12  m@xmath10 measuring the quadrupole transition lines of h@xmath7 using the infrared space observatory ( iso ) , assuming a distance of 3.6  mpc and an area coverage of 14 ",
    "@xmath2  27  . if we assume the same distance and coverage ( the _ west peak _ would be left outside ) , the warm gas mass detected would be 9.4  @xmath2  10@xmath12  m@xmath10 .",
    "@xcite estimate that the 2.5% of the gas in ic  342 is warm , using previous published data from @xcite in various @xmath16co , @xmath45co and c@xmath13o transitions for the total molecular gas mass value , measured with a variety of telescopes .",
    "using the same value for the total molecular gas mass ( and correcting for the distance ) we find that the percentage increases to 4.7% . additionally , @xcite report the 10% of the total molecular gas in ic  342 to be warm .",
    "@xcite use the warm gas mass value reported by @xcite corrected for the assumed distance ( 1.8  mpc ) , and compare it to the total molecular gas mass measured using @xmath45c@xmath46o data taken with the heinrich - hertz - telescope . assuming the same distance ( 1.8  mpc ) and amount of total molecular gas mass than @xcite , and considering the three peaks , since the beam of heinrich - hertz - telescope ( 34  )",
    "covers all three of them , the amount of warm gas mass would be 7.2  @xmath2  10@xmath1  m@xmath10 , which represents the 5.5% of the total molecular gas mass . in summary , using two different values for the total molecular gas mass ( from @xcite and @xcite ) , and two different area coverages , we still find that the percentage of warm gas mass to total molecular gas mass is @xmath3  5% .",
    "we have imaged the nuclear region of ic  342 in nh@xmath0(6,6 ) using the vla .",
    "three emission peaks are detected .",
    "the _ ( 6,6 ) peak _ corresponds well with gmc c and is probably a column density and temperature peak driven by a burst of star formation at the position where inflowing gas accumulates at a nuclear ring .",
    "continuum peak _ is offset from gmcs b , n and a , but coincides with the 1.3  cm continuum peak .",
    "the 6  cm continuum peak is also very close , and due to the different resolution betweeen the two maps , we can not rule out that the two peaks could be in fact coincident .",
    "continuum peak _ is likely a temperature peak corresponding to very hot gas similar to the hot gas seen in our own galactic center around sgr  a*. the _ west peak _ is a tentative detection with not known molecular or continuum emission counterpart .",
    "the fact that the _ west peak _ remains undetected in lower transition lines might be due to absorption along the line - of - sight , as is the case for the `` high - line - ratio - cloud '' in the galactic center .",
    "the presence of gmc n , as detected by @xcite , could not be positively confirmed in nh@xmath0(6,6 ) emission .",
    "nh@xmath0(6,6 ) emission above noise - level is detected at the position where this gmc has been reported .",
    "however , we did not detect a distinctive feature at this location .",
    "we thank c .- w . tsai and m. lebrn for sharing their results in advance of publication .",
    "thanks are also due to e. schinnerer and d. meier for providing the maps we have used for comparison and to t. helfer for kindly answering all our questions regarding her results . during the development of this study , mm - c has been supported by an academia sinica institute of astronomy and astrophysics ( asiaa ) fellowship and a smithsonian institution visiting student grant .",
