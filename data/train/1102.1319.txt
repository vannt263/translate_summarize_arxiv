    "models of coupled limit cycle oscillators are widely used to describe self - synchronization phenomena in various branches of science .",
    "the applications include physical systems like josephson junctions @xcite , lasers @xcite , and electrochemical oscillators @xcite , but similar models are also used for neuronal ensembles  @xcite , the dynamics of pedestrians on bridges @xcite , applauding persons  @xcite , etc .    in many cases a model of a",
    "fully connected ( globally coupled ) network is appropriate , it means that the oscillator population is treated in the mean field approximation",
    ". ensembles of weakly interacting self - sustained oscillators are successfully handled in the framework of phase approximation @xcite .",
    "most popular are the kuramoto model of sine - coupled phase oscillators , and its extension , the kuramoto - sakaguchi model @xcite .",
    "this model describes self - synchronization and appearance of a collective mode ( mean field ) in an ensemble of generally non - identical elements as a nonequilibrium phase transition .",
    "the basic assumptions behind the kuramoto model are that of weak coupling and of closeness of frequencies of oscillators , the latter results in the presence of resonant terms in the coupling function only .",
    "references to detailed aspects of the kuramoto model can be found in  @xcite .    in many cases the ensembles of oscillators",
    "are not uniform and can be considered as consisting of several subensembles ( e.g. , in brain different groups of neurons can have different characteristic rhythms ) .",
    "if one still assumes that the frequencies of these subgroups are close ( compared to the coupling ) , then a model of several interacting subpopulations  @xcite or of an ensemble having a bimodal ( or a multi - modal ) distribution of frequencies   is adopted .",
    "similarly , one can also model two ensembles , one of which consists of active and another of passive elements , which are coupled resonantly due to closeness of their frequencies  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we study a novel situation of _ non - resonantly _ coupled oscillator ensembles .",
    "we assume that there are several groups of oscillators , the frequencies in each group are close to each other , but are strongly ( compared to the coupling strength ) different between the groups .",
    "in this situation the coupling within the group is resonant , like in usual kuramoto - type models , but the coupling between the groups can be only non - resonant  , see  @xcite . ] .",
    "it means that the coupling can be via non - oscillating , slow variables only , i.e. via the amplitudes of the mean fields . in the context of a single kuramoto model such a dependence on the amplitude of the mean field corresponds to a nonlinearity of coupling ,",
    "recently studied in  .",
    "nonlinearity in this context means that the effect of the collective mode on an individual unit depends on the amplitude of this mode , so that , e.g. , the interaction of the field and of a unit can be attractive for a weak field and repulsive for a strong one .",
    "mathematically , this is represented by the dependence of the parameters of the kuramoto - sakaguchi model ( the coupling strength , the effective frequency spreading , and the phase shift ) on the mean field amplitude .",
    "here we generalize this approach to several ensembles , so that the parameters of the kuramoto - sakaguchi model describing each subgroup depend on the mean field amplitudes of other subgroups ( e.g. , resonant interactions within a group of oscillators can be attractive or repulsive dependent on the amplitude of the order parameter of another group ) .    in section  [ sec : bm ]",
    "we introduce the basic model of non - resonantly interacting ensembles .",
    "we also formulate the equations for the mean fields of the ensembles following the ott - antonsen theory  @xcite .",
    "the simplest situation of two interacting ensembles is studied in section  [ sec : two ] . in section",
    "[ sec : three ] we describe three and several interacting ensembles , focusing on nontrivial regimes of sequential synchronous activity following a heteroclinic cycle , and on chaotic dynamics .",
    "a popular model describing _ resonant _ interactions in an ensemble of oscillators having close frequencies is due to kuramoto and sakaguchi  @xcite @xmath0 here @xmath1 is oscillator s phase , @xmath2 is the complex order parameter ( mean field ) that also serves as a measure for synchrony in the ensemble , @xmath3 are natural frequencies of oscillators , and @xmath4 is a complex coupling constant .",
    "recently , ott and antonsen  @xcite have demonstrated that in the thermodynamic limit @xmath5 , and asymptotically for large times the evolution of the order parameter @xmath2 in the case of a lorentzian distribution of natural frequencies @xmath6^{-1}$ ] around the central frequency @xmath7 is governed by a simple ordinary differential equation @xmath8 written for the amplitude and the phase of the order parameter defined according to @xmath9 , the ott - antonsen equations @xmath10 are easy to study : eq .",
    "( [ eq : oareal ] ) defines the stationary amplitude of the mean field ( which is non - zero above the synchronization threshold @xmath11 ) , while eq .",
    "( [ eq : oaimag ] ) yields the frequency of the mean field .",
    "we consider several ensembles of oscillators , each characterized by its own parameters @xmath12 .",
    "the main assumption is that the central frequencies @xmath7 of different populations are not close to each other , and also high - order resonances between them are not present .",
    "such a situation appears typical for neural ensembles , where different areas of brain demonstrate oscillations in a very broad range of frequencies , from alpha to gamma rhythms . because there is no resonant interaction between the oscillators in different ensembles",
    ", they can interact only non - resonantly , via the absolute values of the mean fields .",
    "assuming that only kuramoto order parameters ( [ eq : kursak ] ) ( but not higher - order daido order parameters @xmath13 ) enter the coupling , a general non - resonant interaction between populations can be described by the dependencies of the parameters @xmath12 on the amplitudes of the mean fields @xmath14 , where index @xmath15 counts the subpopulations .",
    "moreover , one can see from ( [ eq : oareal],[eq : oaimag ] ) that the equation for the amplitude is independent on the phase , therefore we can restrict our attention to the amplitude dynamics ( [ eq : oareal ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we assume the coupling to be week , so only the leading order corrections @xmath16 are included .",
    "all this leads to the following general model for interacting populations @xmath17 with coupling constants @xmath18 .",
    "note that because the widths of the frequencies distribution can not be negative , coefficients @xmath19 must satisfy @xmath20 .",
    "below we assume that there is no nonlinearity inside ensembles @xmath21",
    ".    in this paper we will not investigate model ( [ eq : basmod ] ) in its full generality , as it would require a rather tedious analysis .",
    "instead , we will consider two simpler models , which describe particular types of interaction , but nevertheless allow us to demonstrate interesting dynamical patterns . in model",
    "a we assume that only frequencies are influenced by the coupling , i.e. @xmath22 .",
    "this leads to a system @xmath23 another model b takes into account the interaction via coupling constants only ( i.e. @xmath24 ) ; additionally we will assume here that the distributions of frequencies in all interacting ensembles are narrow @xmath25 .",
    "in the limit of identical oscillators we obtain from ( [ eq : basmod ] ) @xmath26 here we note that the ott - antonsen equations for the ensemble of identical oscillators describe not a general case , but a particular solution , while a general description delivers the watanabe - strogatz theory  @xcite .",
    "thus the dynamics of model b should be considered as a special singular limit @xmath27 .",
    "below , in sections [ sec : two ] and [ sec : three ] we describe the dynamics of these two models , for the cases of two , and three and more interacting ensembles , respectively .",
    "let us first rewrite models ( [ eq : modela],[eq : modelb ] ) for the simplest case of only two interacting ensembles .",
    "additionally , for model a we assume @xmath28 ( equivalently , one could renormalize the amplitudes of order parameters @xmath29 to get rid of these coefficients ) .",
    "thus the model a reads @xmath30 for model b a normalization of amplitudes is not possible , and it reads @xmath31 generally , parameters @xmath32 can have different signs .    as the first property of both models",
    "we mention that the dynamics is restricted to the domain @xmath33 .",
    "formally , this follows directly from ( [ eq : basmod ] ) , physically this corresponds to the admissible range of values of the order parameter .",
    "furthermore , for model a ( [ eq : modela2 ] ) we can apply the bendixon - dulac criterion @xmath34 from which it follows that it can not possess periodic orbits .",
    "remarkably , model b ( [ eq : modelb2 ] ) can be written as a hamiltonian one . with an ansatz @xmath35",
    "it can be represented in a hamiltonian form @xmath36 thus model b may demonstrate a family of periodic orbits if the levels of the hamiltonian are closed curves .",
    "we stress that the hamiltonian structure of the model does not exclude existence of stable equilibria at @xmath37 because the transformation ( [ eq : hamans ] ) is singular at these states ; in the hamiltonian formulation ( [ eq : hamilt ] ) these stable equilibria correspond to trajectories moving toward @xmath38 .",

    "another case is that of positive @xmath155 and asymmetric couplings : @xmath156 under described above conditions ( [ case4b-1 ] ) , ( [ case4b-2 ] ) it is easy to show that only one stable fixed point @xmath44 exists , so all trajectories approach @xmath58 . in the case of ( [ case4b-2 ] )",
