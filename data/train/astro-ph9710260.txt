    "the cat imaging telescope has been described elsewhere ( rivoal , 1997 ) .",
    "briefly , it consists of a 18 m@xmath3 mirror and a 546 pmt camera with a pixel size of 0.12@xmath0 . the trigger is generated out of the 288 inner pmt s , which are further divided into 9 overlapping sectors of 48 pmt s each .",
    "the trigger condition is that at least 4 pmt s in any sector fire above a threshold of 3 photoelectrons .",
    "the pmt signals , gated by a 12 ns wide analog switch , are recorded by a 15 bits charge adc .",
    "the trigger rate is of the order of @xmath115 hz at zenith .",
    "extensive monte - carlo simulations of gamma - ray cherenkov showers were performed in order to determine the image parameters ( width , length , orientation ) and effective collecting area as a function of energy and zenith angle .",
    "these results are used to i ) optimize the image cuts for gamma / hadron discrimination and ii ) estimate the absolute fluxes and energy spectra from gamma - ray sources . with the absence of a calibration gamma - ray beam , one must rely on the best possible knowledge concerning shower development , atmospheric properties , optical parameters and electronic signal processing . only recently , the intense flaring activity of mkn 421 and mkn 501 enabled the detection of several thousands of gamma - rays with a high signal / noise ratio .",
    "these data can be used to check measured gamma - ray image parameters against mc simulations . in this paper , the distributions of width and length for gamma - rays in different energy ranges , as measured during strong flares from mkn 501 , are presented and compared with the results of simulations .",
    "energy - dependant image cuts are derived which optimize the gamma / hadron separation .",
    "these results are used to search for a gamma - ray signal from mkn 180 with improved sensitivity .",
    "finally the differential energy spectrum of the crab nebula in the energy range 0.4 - 5.0 tev is presented .",
    "during observations in the night of april 16 1997 , an intense flare from the direction of mkn 501 was detected by the cat telescope . showing a high signal / noise ratio ,",
    "these data were used to study the gamma - ray image parameters as recorded by the cat telescope at zenith angles @xmath430@xmath0 .",
    "the moment - based parameters _ width _ and _ length _ were calculated for each event in both the on and off data .",
    "events were selected for analysis according to the following cuts : _",
    "alpha_@xmath410@xmath0 and 0.5@xmath5_dist_@xmath41.3@xmath0 .",
    "the results were sorted according to a parameter related to the light intensity , viz .",
    "_ logsize_=log(_size _ ) where _ size _ is the total number of photoelectrons recorded in the image .",
    "subtracting the distributions of width and length in the on data from those in the off data , these distributions pertaining to gamma - rays were obtained .",
    "the observed width and length distributions for gamma - rays are shown in figs . 1 and 2 respectively for different bands in",
    "_ logsize _ , together with the same distributions for hadronic background events ( off data ) .",
    "it is clearly seen that the gamma / hadron separation increases dramatically with increasing _",
    "logsize_. in the lowest _ logsize _ band [ 1.5 - 2.0 ] , one can see rather poor discrimination between gamma - rays and hadrons .",
    "the optimum sensitivity , trading between @xmath6/h discrimination and statistics , is obtained by selecting events with _ logsize_@xmath71.9 corresponding to an energy threshold of @xmath1400 gev .",
    "the resulting sensitivity for the crab is 4.6@xmath8t@xmath9 with a detection rate of 1.5 @xmath6/minute .",
    "also shown in figs .",
    "1 and 2 are the results from mc simulations .",
    "the agreement between observed and simulated distributions is seen to be quite satisfactory , thus strenghtening the confidence in mc simulations which are further used to estimate energy spectra and absolute fluxes .",
    "the optimized values for the cuts on _ width _ and _ length _ are given in table 1 . according to mc , these cuts",
    "remove only @xmath120% of gamma - rays .",
    ".the optimized cuts on width and length in different _ logsize _ bands ( in degrees ) [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the optimized cuts for the moment - based analysis , as derived in the preceding section , were used to search for a gamma - ray signal from mkn 180 .",
    "the database consists of 15 on / off pairs with a total of 5.4 hours each at zenith angle @xmath430@xmath0 taken in march and april 1997 . after applying the optimizedcuts ( _ alpha_@xmath410@xmath0 , _",
    "logsize_@xmath71.9 , width and length as given in table 1 ) , the remaining number of events are n@xmath10=1131 and n@xmath11=1142 for the on and off data respectively .",
    "the resulting 3@xmath8 upper limit for the gamma - ray flux from mkn 180 is 0.44 @xmath6/minute or , equivalently , 0.29 crab unit .",
    "the crab nebula differential energy spectrum was derived using 8.5 hours on - source observations in the on / off mode made during the 1996/97 winter season . the energy assigned to each event",
    "was estimated according to the method elaborated by le bohec ( 1996 ) .",
    "the method relies on fitting each recorded cherenkov image to a template of images generated at different gamma - ray energies and impact parameters to the telescope .",
    "a chi - square cut to the fitted events selects gamma - like events . according to mc simulations ,",
    "the energy resolution is of the order of 20 - 25% .",
    "mc simulations are also used to estimate the effective collecting area and spill - over for each energy bin .",
    "the resulting differential energy spectrum is @xmath12=2.46@xmath130.22@xmath1410@xmath15e@xmath16m@xmath17s@xmath18tev@xmath18 with the errors quoted being statistical only .",
    "correction for an instrumental deadtime of 7% was taken into account . the crab differential energy spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "a study of intense gamma - ray flares from mkn 501 , as observed by the cat imaging telescope , has led to optimize the moment - based analysis cuts .",
    "these results were also used to validate the mc simulation of the experiment . a 3@xmath8 upper limit to the gamma - ray flux from mkn 180 was derived . finally , the differential energy spectrum of the crab nebula in the 0.4 - 5.0 tev range was presented .",
    "more investigations are being made to further improve the data analysisand , particularly , to study the systematic errors .. recently , an additional guard ring of 54 pmt s was implemented in the cat camera which must lead to better energy resolution ."
