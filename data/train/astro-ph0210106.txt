    "this letter reports on the most recent progress in our efforts to convert pre@xmath0main - sequence ( pms ) single - lined spectroscopic binaries ( sb1s ) to double - lined systems ( sb2s ) in order to ( 1 ) provide dynamical mass data for the calibration of young star evolutionary models , and ( 2 ) to help determine the unbiased , low - mass pms mass ratio distribution of sb2s @xcite .",
    "dynamical mass ratios have almost exclusively been measured in visible light and show a distribution weighted strongly towards unity . because this is probably a selection effect , given that the detection of a spectroscopic secondary is far easier for flux , and therefore mass , ratios close to unity @xcite , the underlying astrophysical distribution of the mass ratio values is unknown . in @xcite",
    "we applied infrared ( ir ) spectroscopy to the problem of identifying the secondary stars in pms sb1s because these low - mass companions are red and thus are more readily detectable in ir light .",
    "this project is an endeavor to convert all known , pms sb1s to sb2s .",
    "@xcite show that this approach yields the smallest mass - ratios ever derived for pms sb systems .",
    "to date , all of the ir - converted sb2s display values of @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "we have applied this ir approach to uz tau e , identified as a 19.1 day period sb1 by @xcite .",
    "it forms a hierarchical quadruple with uz tau w , itself a 0@xmath634 binary , @xmath74@xmath8 to the west @xcite .",
    "together with gw ori , dq tau @xcite , and v4046 sgr @xcite , uz tau e is one of only 4 classical t tauri star sbs known .",
    "emission line and color diagnostics indicate that accretion is occurring on to the stars in uz tau e @xcite despite the expected formation of a gap in its circumbinary disk @xcite .",
    "the presence of the circumbinary disk around the uz tau e sb enabled @xcite to measure the distance dependent , total binary mass by mapping the keplerian rotation of the @xmath9co gas in the disk .",
    "thus , with the determination of the mass ratio , we are able to calculate the component stellar masses and orbital inclination . in ",
    "2 we briefly describe our observations and data reduction .",
    "the analysis and results appear in  3 .",
    "section 4 provides a brief discussion .",
    "@xmath2-band observations were made with the keck ii near - ir spectrometer , nirspec , a cross - dispersed , cryogenic echelle spectrometer employing a 1024 @xmath10 1024 aladdin insb array detector @xcite .",
    "the resolving power was @xmath11 and @xmath12 for the non - adaptive optics ( non - ao ) and ao modes , respectively . for ao mode observations ,",
    "dispersion solutions were derived using arc lamp lines .",
    "otherwise we used night sky oh lines @xcite .",
    "integration times for a single exposure were usually 300 s. further details about the observations are provided in @xcite .",
    "the data were reduced using redspec , software designed at ucla for the analysis of nirspec data . for the analysis described here we used only order 49 .",
    "the central wavelength of this order is @xmath71.55 @xmath13 m ; order 49 is almost completely free from terrestrial absorption lines .",
    "table 1 provides a log of the observations ; column ( 1 ) gives the ut date , column ( 2 ) the observing mode ( i.e. non - ao or ao ) , and column ( 3 ) the modified julian day of the observation .",
    "figure 1 shows the spectra from the six epochs of observations .",
    "these were analyzed as described in @xcite and @xcite using the two - dimensional cross - correlation program todcor @xcite and our library of stellar templates .",
    "for every epoch of observation , the secondary star spectrum was detected ; velocities for the primary and secondary stars appear in columns ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) of table 1 .",
    "uncertainties in the velocities reflect the addition in quadrature of the internal uncertainty in the todcor analysis and the @xmath31 km s@xmath14 uncertainty between our velocity reference frame , as estimated from the template star radial velocities , and that of others @xcite .",
    "the stellar templates that produced the maximum correlation in the todcor analysis were either gl 763 or gl 752a for the primary , and gl 213 or gl 402 , rotationally broadened to 25@xmath030 km s@xmath14 , for the secondary .",
    "the centre de donnes astronomiques de strasbourg ( simbad ) lists gl 763 and gl 752a with spectral types of m0 and m3 , respectively , however , gl 752a is probably misclassified .",
    "figure 1 of @xcite shows the spectra in our template library ; at 1.55 @xmath13 m , the spectrum of gl 752a appears to be earlier than m3 and is better matched to an m0 or m1.5 star .",
    "we therefore regard the best fitting primary templates as consistent with the m1 visible light spectral classification given by @xcite for the entire uz tau e system .",
    "the spectral types of the best fitting secondary templates are both m4 .",
    "the average 1.55 @xmath13 m flux ratio is @xmath15 . as discussed in @xcite , the cross - correlation analysis yields component velocities that are very reliable because they are based on many spectral lines .",
    "however , estimates of spectral type and flux ratio must be regarded as only representative because of the mismatch in surface gravity and metallicity between the main - sequence star templates and the pms targets .",
    "the sb1 results reported by @xcite give the orbital period , @xmath16 days , the eccentricity , @xmath17 , the projected primary semi - major axis , @xmath18 au , and the primary semi - amplitude , @xmath19 km s@xmath14 .",
    "we derived the orbital elements of the uz tau e sb2 by a least - squares minimization .",
    "the phases which appear in column ( 6 ) of table 1 were calculated using our value for the period derived from this procedure , @xmath200.011 days .",
    "figure 2 shows the orbital fit to the observed velocities and table 2 lists our orbital elements in standard notation following @xcite .",
    "we derive a mass ratio of @xmath21 .",
    "our results are in excellent agreement with the parameters in common measured by @xcite .    by measuring the keplerian rotation of the uz tau e circumbinary disk , @xcite determined @xmath22 for the binary .",
    "this scales with distance because it depends on the radial scale of the disk . combining @xmath23 with @xmath24 , derived here , we obtain the orbital inclination ( @xmath25/d pc)@xmath26 , or @xmath274.4 degrees for @xmath28 pc @xcite , and the component masses , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the inclination of the uz tau e circumbinary disk measured by its @xmath9co j=2@xmath01 rotation is , for @xmath28 pc , 56 @xmath32 degrees ; the apparent projected inclination of the disk in 1.3 mm continuum emission is 54 @xmath33 degrees @xcite .",
    "this is consistent , within the uncertainties , with our derived value , @xmath274.4 degrees ( @xmath28 pc ) , for the orbit of the spectroscopic binary .",
    "the range of values is @xmath31 degrees for @xmath32 pc .",
    "this consistency between the orbital and circumbinary disk inclinations indicates that the stellar orbit and the disk are probably coplanar .",
    "figure 3 shows the components of uz tau e plotted on the h - r diagram .",
    "the m1 primary and m4 secondary were assigned effective temperatures of 3700@xmath3150 k and 3300@xmath3150 k , respectively , from the conversion presented in figure 5 of @xcite . using @xmath33 mag for the sb2 , corrected for @xmath34 mag @xcite and apportioned according to the flux ratio , @xmath15 (  3 )",
    ", we obtained the component @xmath2-band magnitudes . applying the appropriate bolometric correction ,",
    "2.31 mag for the m1 and 2.44 mag for the m4 @xcite , then enabled the calculation of the component luminosities , @xmath35 @xmath36 and @xmath37 @xmath36 .",
    "the large uncertainties in @xmath38 and @xmath39 are domianted by the @xmath320 pc uncertainty in the location of uz tau e along the line of sight to the taurus sfr .",
    "the luminosity ratio , @xmath40 , is approximately equal to the @xmath2-band flux ratio @xcite .",
    "the pms evolutionary tracks of @xcite and @xcite are shown in figure 3 .",
    "both sets of tracks indicate that the system is relatively young , @xmath71@xmath1010@xmath41 years . for both sets of tracks ,",
    "the secondary star lies within 1 @xmath42 of the mass track appropriate to its derived dynamical mass ; however , the primary star appears on mass tracks with a value 3@xmath04 @xmath42 smaller than its dynamically derived mass .",
    "the model - based mass ratios , @xmath43 for the tracks of @xcite and @xmath44 for those of @xcite , are consistent with the dynamical mass ratio , @xmath45 to within 1 @xmath42 , but this is a result of the propagation of the uncertainties in the track - derived masses , which are as high as @xmath750 % .    it is unlikely that the source of this discrepancy lies in the simple application of the @xmath2-band flux ratio to apportion the component luminosities , even though this ratio is uncertain (  3 ) , because the mass of an m1 star is relatively insensitive to luminosity on the tracks of both @xcite and @xcite . we can rule out contamination by a third component in the uz tau e system on the basis of our cross - correlation analysis as well as mm - wave and near - ir imaging of the system ( e.g. , dutrey et al . 1996 ) .",
    "several origins for this discrepancy are possible .",
    "( 1 ) uz tau e may be on the near side of the taurus star forming region at a distance of @xmath7120 pc .",
    "the total mass of the sb2 system as derived by @xcite is a function of distance .",
    "( 2 ) the mass of the spectroscopic system measured by @xcite may be an overestimate if a dense ring of circumbinary material with a radius of a few au is present in the disk .",
    "( 3 ) the rotation of the circumbinary disk may be non - keplerian . ( 4 ) the main - sequence templates may be poorly matched to the pms objects and hence yield incorrect spectral types . ( 5 ) given the complexities of the calculations of pms evolution at very young ages , some uncertainties may also be expected in the theoretical tracks .    to test the plausibility of the first two possibilities listed above we combine a 20 pc ( 14 % ) underestimate in the distance to uz tau e and a 5 % overestimate in the total stellar mass measured at millimeter wavelengths , resulting from the presence of an undetected dense ring of material within the uz tau e circumbinary disk , similar to the structure in the circumbinary disk of gg tau @xcite .",
    "we now derive @xmath46 @xmath4 , yielding @xmath47 @xmath4 and @xmath48 @xmath4 .",
    "the revised dynamical value of @xmath49 still departs by 2@xmath03 @xmath42 from the location of the star on the h - r diagram .",
    "the difference in the dynamical and model values for @xmath50 is still @xmath511 @xmath42 .    the low - surface gravity expected in a young , pms star may cause its spectrum to appear to be later than the object s mass would indicate @xcite",
    "however , precisely to account for such an effect , we have used the spectral type to effective temperature conversion of the @xcite to place the sb2 components on the h - r diagram .",
    "in addition , agreement between the tracks and the dynamically measured secondary star mass is inconsistent with this interpretation . on the baraffe tracks",
    ", the uz tau e secondary appears to be slightly _ more _ massive than expected from the dynamical data . on the tracks of palla & stahler ,",
    "it is slightly less massive than expected , but for both sets of tracks , the discrepancy in the position of the secondary is @xmath511 @xmath42 ( figure 3 ) . to investigate this phenomenon further , observations and analyses of the type we report here are required to connect stars of well - determined mass with the appropriate spectral types and effective temperatures .",
    "dq tau is also a short period ( 16 day ) classical t tauri sb2 @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable in that accretion onto the central stars from a circumbinary disk is regulated by the eccentric orbit of the stars .",
    "most photometric studies of uz tau e have not isolated the system from uz tau w ; it is unclear if photometric variability synchronized with the period of the sb2 is present .",
    "if the discrepancy between our dynamical mass measurement and the masses obtained from the h - r diagram is attributable to unusual accretion processes , it is difficult to understand how such would cause a star to appear _ less _ massive , i.e. appear to have a later spectral type , than the dynamical measurement implies .",
    "@xcite studied the components in another classical t tauri sb2 , v4046 sgr , a 2.4 d period system , and found a discrepancy between the mass ratio determined dynamically , @xmath52 , and from an evolutionary model , @xmath53 .",
    "however , deriving uncertainties for their observed and theoretical mass ratio , from their table 1 and figure 3 , respectively , we find that their numbers are consistent to within 1 @xmath42 and therefore are not discrepant .",
    "the total mass of the v4046 sgr sb2 has not been measured dynamically so the individual stellar masses are not known .",
    "@xcite suggest that the unusual behavior in v4046 sgr might be attributable to the distorted structure of stars in such a short period binary .",
    "however , in uz tau e , with an orbital period of @xmath719 d , the tidal effects will be much smaller . with an orbital semimajor axis of @xmath733 @xmath54",
    ", there is only a weak interaction between the 2@xmath03 @xmath54 radius components .",
    "unfortunately , it is not possible at the present time to deconvolve the effects of metallicity , rotation , and surface gravity simultaneously for blended components of an sb2 .",
    "a combination of some of the factors discussed above may ultimately be responsible for the inconsistencies discussed in this letter .",
    "clarification of the questions raised here may require very high spatial resolution orbital mapping with future facilities such as the _ space interferometry mission_.",
