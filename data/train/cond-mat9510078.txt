    "@xcite , universal short time behavior ( ustb ) in critical dynamics occurs after quenching a spin system with nonconserved order parameter ( model a @xcite ) from a high - temperature initial state to the its critical point . in its",
    "most pronounced form the ustb manifests itself in the time dependence of the order - parameter expectation value . starting from a small average initial magnetization @xmath3 ,",
    "the order starts to grow during a nonequilibrium ( though universal ) period shortly after the quench , before the decay to the equilibrium value zero sets in .",
    "the initial increase is governed by a power law ,    [ order ] @xmath4 and the short - time exponent @xmath5 is given by @xcite @xmath6    i.e. , it is determined by the difference between the anomalous dimensions @xmath7 and @xmath2 of the _ initial _ order - parameter field and the equilibrium magnetization , respectively .",
    "( @xmath1 denotes the dynamic equilibrium exponent . ) @xmath5 ( or , equivalently @xmath7 ) is a new exponent , not expressible in terms of known static and/or dynamic exponents @xcite .",
    "thus , the initial increase will only occur under the condition that @xmath8 , which , for instance , is fulfilled in the case of the ising model for spatial dimensions @xmath9 .",
    "recently significant progress has been made in quantitative studies of the ustb by means of monte carlo ( mc ) simulations .",
    "it turned out to be possible to observe the short - time power law ( [ power ] ) in surprisingly small systems and after relatively short simulation times@xcite .",
    "as the exponents governing the short - time behavior of thermal averages can be expressed in terms of scaling relations among short - time and equilibrium exponents , it is possible to extract even static exponents from a relatively early stage of the dynamics , whereby the problem of critical slowing down is circumvented to some extent@xcite .",
    "as pointed out by janssen @xcite , the qualitative mechanism underlying the ustb is the following : after the quench the initially small correlation length starts to grow towards its equilibrium value . during the early stages ,",
    "when fluctuations are still short - ranged , a mean - field description of the process should hold . since in ising - like systems",
    "@xmath10 is always larger than the real @xmath11 , it is plausible that shortly after the quench a spontaneous magnetization will evolve , pointing in the direction of the initial magnetization @xmath3 . at some point , when @xmath12 has grown to a certain size , this increase will come to a halt , and afterwards the decay to the equilibrium value @xmath13 will begin .",
    "so far in both analytical and numerical calculations the ustb has only been studied in ising - like systems , with a conventional critical ( or tricritical ) point@xcite .",
    "however , the phenomenon ( and the applications built thereon ) should not only occur at a critical point , but , more generally , in situations where scale - invariant long - ranged fluctuations evolve after a quench from a high - temperature initial state ( or after any other comparable change of the state of the system ) . in the following this scenario",
    "is tested for a quench to the kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) phase ? in two - dimensional systems with @xmath14 symmetry ( or variants of it ) below the kt transition temperature @xmath15 , one finds a range of temperatures with a power - law decay of the static correlation function@xcite .",
    "examples are the @xmath16 model and the @xmath17-state clock model for @xmath18 .",
    "additionally , mean - field theory predicts for these systems ( erroneously ) a conventional critical point , and one finds generally @xmath19 .",
    "thus , taking into account the foregoing discussion , the ustb should also be observable after a quench to the kt phase , and it is interesting to see whether the methods described in refs .",
    "@xcite can be applied , i.e. , whether for instance the equilibrium exponent @xmath2 can be extracted from the short - time relaxational behavior .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in the next section we recall analytical and numerical results for the clock model . in sect.iii",
    "we derive the scaling behavior of the relevant thermodynamic quantities , taking into account the anomalous scaling of the initial magnetization .",
    "our own simulations have been carried out for the @xmath20 clock model .",
    "the numerical results are presented in sect.iv .",
    "according to the mermin - wagner theorem @xcite , the two - dimensional _ xy _ model can not undergo a conventional para-/ferromagnetic phase transition .",
    "however , as shown by kosterlitz and thouless @xcite , there exists a transition between a state with unbounded and bounded vortices at @xmath21 .    a model that in many respect interpolates between the ising model and the _ xy _ model is the @xmath17-state clock model , defined by the hamiltonian @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 denotes the sum over nearest neighbors .",
    "this spin system is equivalent to the _ xy _ model for @xmath25 and to the ising model for @xmath26 .",
    "it was first shown by jose et al .",
    "@xcite and later on verified by numerous mc studies @xcite that the @xmath17-state clock model has a single ising - like critical point for @xmath27 . for @xmath18 , on the other hand , there exist two transition points , with temperatures @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively . for @xmath30 a paramagnetic high temperature phase exists , and for @xmath31",
    "the system becomes ferromagnetic . for @xmath32",
    ", however , a kt phase with `` quasi long - range order '' emerges , where the correlation function behaves as @xmath33 , with the anomalous dimension @xmath34 continuously depending on the temperature @xcite .",
    "both transitions are of kt type , i.e. , the correlation length diverges exponentially as @xmath28 @xmath35 is approached from below ( above)@xcite .",
    "our mc simulations  the results are presented in sect.ivwere done for the @xmath20-state clock model .",
    "the case @xmath20 was studied in great detail in the literature , partly motivated by the fact that in real two - dimensional systems one expects anisotropies with six - fold symmetry due to the lattice structure@xcite .",
    "approximate analytic results for the transition temperatures and the exponent @xmath36 have been obtained by jose et al . @xcite . while @xmath37 was found to be identical with the kt transition temperature of the @xmath16 model , t / j=0.95 , @xmath28",
    "was predicted to vary as @xmath38 ( which means @xmath39 for @xmath20 ) .",
    "( here and in the following we set the boltzmann constant @xmath40 . )",
    "the exponent @xmath2 was found to vary between @xmath41 and @xmath42 ( which means @xmath43 for @xmath20 ) .    among the mc analyses mentioned above",
    ", we used the results of challa and landau @xcite for comparison with our own data .",
    "they found for the transition temperatures @xmath44 and @xmath45 and for the corresponding exponents @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "( no errors for @xmath36 are given in ref.@xcite . )",
    "both the results for the transition temperatures and the exponents are consistent with the analytic results of ref.@xcite .",
    "dynamic mc simulations for the 6-state clock model were performed by kaski et al .",
    "@xcite , but in this work the relaxational behavior in the ferromagnetic phase was studied , with emphasis on the growth of the domain size after a quench .",
    "thus , concerning the temperature ranges , this work is complementary to ours .    in order to comply with the requirements for the occurrence of the ustb discussed in the introduction , the system has to have a mean - field @xmath10 above the temperature to which the quench is carried out . in the case of the clock model",
    "it is straightforward to show that there exists a @xmath10 for all @xmath48 and that @xmath49 for @xmath26 ( ising case ) and @xmath50 for @xmath51 , where @xmath52 denotes the spatial dimension .",
    "comparison with exact or numerical results for the clock models shows that the upper transition temperature ( which is a critical point for @xmath53 ) is below @xmath10 for all @xmath48 .",
    "e.g. for @xmath20 , the upper transition temperature @xmath54 is well below @xmath55 .",
    "in the kt phase , i.e. for all temperatures below @xmath15 , the bulk _ equilibrium _ correlation length is formally infinite . after a sudden quench from a high - temperature initial state to the kt phase , the initially small correlation length @xmath12 starts to grow , and the large - scale fluctuations gradually develop .",
    "let us first discuss relaxational processes in ising - like systems . in this case",
    ", after a short period of nonuniversal behavior following the quench , the growth of the correlation length is described by the universal power law , @xmath56 and in the bulk system @xmath12 becomes `` macroscopic '' for large times .",
    "moreover , in the universal regime @xmath12 is the _ only _ macroscopic time scale and allows to characterize the time dependence of correlation functions completely . in the finite systems , ( [ xioft ] ) holds as long as @xmath57 ( where @xmath58 is the linear system dimension ) . in the following this scenario",
    "will be called simple ( dynamic ) scaling .    in the kt phase vortices",
    "are generated in the course of the quench and potentially disturb the simple scaling picture@xcite .",
    "deviations from the simple scaling picture are expected mainly for intermediate times .",
    "as we shall see from the evaluation of the mc data , modifications compared to the ising dynamics really occur in certain quantities in form of a relatively slow approach to the power - law form .",
    "below we review the simple scaling scenario concerning the quantities studied in our mc simulation , with emphasis on the ( expected ) consequences of the ustb .",
    "modifications due to vortices are discussed in some more detail in the context of the mc simulation in sect.iv .",
    "consider first the expectation value of the magnetization density@xcite .",
    "suppose in the high - temperature initial state an external magnetic field has generated a small ( initial ) magnetization @xmath3 , pointing in the @xmath59 direction of the @xmath60 plane .",
    "then , after the quench , the expectation value of the order parameter , defined by @xmath61 should remain in the direction of the initial magnetization . in the scaling regime",
    "it should further satisfy the homogenity property@xcite @xmath62 where @xmath63 is a rescaling parameter , and the exponents @xmath64 were introduced in eqn.([power ] ) .    from eqn .",
    "( [ ordersc ] ) it follows that , asymptotically , the magnetization behaves as @xmath65 where @xmath66 is a universal scaling function . as an immediate consequence of @xmath67 in eqn .",
    "( [ ordersc ] ) , the rescaled ( or renormalized ) @xmath3 is no longer the initial value of @xmath68 .",
    "however , one still has asymptotically @xmath69 for @xmath70@xcite .",
    "thus the scaling function @xmath66 in ( [ asymp ] ) behaves @xmath71 for @xmath72 , and , as a result , the short - time behavior is described by ( [ order ] ) .",
    "further , from the combination in the argument of @xmath73 in ( [ asymp ] ) one realizes that @xmath3 also gives rise to a novel time scale , @xmath74 . while for @xmath75 the ustb ( [ power ] ) is observed , the system crosses over to the nonlinear decay @xmath76 for @xmath77 , which implies that @xmath78 for @xmath79 and that memory of the initial value @xmath3 is lost for @xmath80 .",
    "can we expect to observe the ustb even for @xmath81 ? obviously , in this case the magnetization vanishes identically for @xmath82 .",
    "however , as demonstrated in ref.@xcite , the ustb leaves its fingerprint on the relaxational behavior of the autocorrelation function @xmath83 which measures the change the system has undergone during the time @xmath84 after the quench . without going into the technical details , we here just present janssen",
    "s result @xcite : @xmath85 i.e. , the short - time exponent @xmath5 also appears in @xmath86 and leads to a deviation from the naive expectation @xmath87 , surprisingly for all @xmath82 .",
    "it was this quantity where the ustb actually was first observed in a mc simulation @xcite .",
    "the third quantity that will play a role in the following is the second moment ( or variance ) of the magnetization .",
    "it is defined by @xmath88 a straightforward analysis reveals that @xmath89 , again for vanishing initial magnetization , takes the scaling form @xmath90 i.e. , the ustb does not influence this quantity@xcite .    as suggested by schlke and zheng@xcite , the three exponents @xmath5 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 , governing the bulk behavior of @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 , respectively , suffice to determine the _ equilibrium _ quantities @xmath2 and @xmath1 from the ustb .",
    "the starting point is the short - time exponent itself , which can be obtained from simulations with small , nonvanishing @xmath3 .",
    "then , from simulations with @xmath81 , the exponents @xmath91 and @xmath92 can be estimated simultaneously . utilizing the scaling relation ( [ lambda ] ) , @xmath1 can be determined , and , in turn , with relation ( [ b ] ) eventually the scaling dimension @xmath2 .",
    "our main hypothesis for the present work is that also in the kt phase , analogously to the situation in the critical ising model , the operator dimension of the initial field , @xmath7 , is different from @xmath2 , and that , as a consequence , the scaling picture developed above also describes the short - time dynamics in the kt phase .",
    "this is neither obvious nor by any means rigorously proved . at the present stage it is merely a working hypothesis , which below will be tested by means of mc simulations . especially for quenches to the kt phase",
    ", we expect all exponents to depend on the respective final temperature to which the quench is carried out .      starting from eqn .",
    "( [ ordersc ] ) , all the results about the scaling behavior of the thermodynamic quantities described so far hold in the bulk system . if we are dealing with a system of finite size  and",
    "certainly this is the case in the mc simulation  the power laws ( [ power ] ) , ( [ lambda ] ) , and ( [ b ] ) hold as long as the time - dependent correlation length @xmath96 is smaller than the system size @xmath58 .",
    "a finite - size scaling analysis reveals how the thermodynamic quantities behave during the later stages of the relaxational process@xcite .",
    "taking into account the finite system size , the analog to ( [ ordersc ] ) reads @xmath97 removing the rescaling parameter @xmath63 by setting @xmath98 , one obtains @xmath99 where @xmath100 is a universal scaling function .",
    "as seen from ( [ asymfs ] ) , the size @xmath58 of the system gives rise to another characteristic time scale @xmath101 ( besides the initial time scale @xmath102 ) , the well - known finite - size scale@xcite . in the kt phase it turns out temperature dependent",
    "further , it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that @xmath103 for @xmath79 , i.e. , the magnetization decays linearly when @xmath104 .",
    "the scaling function @xmath105 in ( [ asymfs ] ) describes the universal dependence of late stages of the relaxational process on the initial magnetization @xmath3 .",
    "this dependence is special to the finite - size system@xcite.in the bulk memory of the initial condition is lost for @xmath106 .    for arbitrary @xmath107 and @xmath108 , the function @xmath100 behaves as @xmath109 , with a scaling function @xmath110 . in this limit",
    "the maximum of the magnetization profile has the scaling form @xmath111 thus , the finite - size scaling behavior of @xmath112 allows in principle to determine _ directly _ the difference @xmath113 .",
    "also for the other quantities discussed in sect.iii.a the asymptotic behavior is modified when @xmath114 .",
    "firstly , the autocorrelation function ( [ auto ] ) also decays linearly for @xmath115 .",
    "secondly , the second moment takes the scaling form @xmath116 in order to reproduce ( [ b ] ) , the scaling function @xmath117 has to approach a constant for @xmath72 . for @xmath79 , @xmath118 , such that in the long - time limit the equilibrium result @xmath119 is obtained .",
    "again , in the kt phase we expect to observe the finite - size scaling scenario presented above , with the characteristic scale @xmath120 depending on the temperature .",
    "we used the usual time - dependent interpretation of the sampling algorithm @xcite , with sequential updating and nonconserved total spin .",
    "we employed the heat - bath algorithm , as described in detail for the clock model in ref .",
    "it is equivalent to glauber dynamics @xcite .",
    "all simulations were carried out on square lattices with varying linear dimension @xmath58 with periodic boundary conditions .    as the initial configurations we used equilibrium states for uncoupled spins in an external magnetic field @xmath121 ( with @xmath81 for the autocorrelation function and the second moment ) .",
    "time - dependent thermal averages were approximated by summing over a number of @xmath122 histories , @xmath122 varying between 1000 and 10000 depending on the size @xmath58 . in order to obtain a measure for the error ,",
    "the @xmath122 histories were divided in 10 - 20 runs , from which statistically independent exponent `` measurements '' , their mean value , and the statistical error of the mean value were obtained .    as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "an attractive feature of the ustb in ising - like systems is that relatively relatively small lattices and short simulation times turned out to be sufficient extract reliable results for exponents@xcite .",
    "however , the estimates obtained will in general to some extent depend upon the lattice size @xmath58 and , in the case of @xmath5 , upon the initial magnetization @xmath3 . in the case of the clock model , it turned out that one has to go to somewhat larger lattices and , especially in the case of the autocorrelation function , the time until the power - law behavior is assumed is increased compared to the ising or potts model .",
    "firstly we discuss our data for the magnetization and the determination of the short - time exponent @xmath5 from them . in order to get an impression of the time dependence of the order parameter , we have calculated relaxation profiles of the 6-state clock model for @xmath123 and @xmath124 in the temperature range @xmath125 ,",
    "i.e. , the lower limit lies well below @xmath28 in the ferromagnetic phase and the upper limit above @xmath37 in the paramagnetic phase .",

    "@xmath126 the magnetization has the tendency to increase initially .",
    "for the highest temperature represented in the figure , this increase lasts only for about 10 - 20 updates of the lattice , but it becomes more and more pronounced at lower temperatures . as one can see from fig.2 , a clearly identifiable initial power - law regime at about @xmath127 can be observed for @xmath128 .",
    "( the time is always given in monte carlo steps per spin . ) all curves in the temperature range @xmath129 have a maximum and thereafter decay exponentially or `` linearly '' @xmath130 .    it is instructive to extract the linear relaxation time @xmath120 from the data in fig.1 .",
    "it depends on both the system size and the temperature ; results for @xmath131 for @xmath123 are displayed in fig.3 ( squares for @xmath20 ) .",
    "the temperature range of the kt phase as obtained by challa and landau @xcite is indicated in the figure .",
    "obviously , in this quantity the signature of the kt phase is a plateau - like structure , roughly located between @xmath28 and @xmath37 of ref.@xcite .",
    "coming from the high - temperature side , @xmath120 increases up to about @xmath132 .",
    "then @xmath120 remains almost unchanged down to @xmath133 and starts to grow rapidly when going to lower temperatures . for @xmath134",
    "the magnetization more or less approaches a constant within the observation time @xmath135 , which means that @xmath120 becomes effectively infinite .",
    "the latter is due to an exponentially growing tunneling time in the ferromagnetic phase@xcite .",
    "+ # 1#20.58#1 +   + for comparison we calculated a number of curves for the 4-state clock model in the vicinity of its ( exact ) critical temperature @xmath136 .",
    "the corresponding linear relaxation time is also shown in fig.3 ( circles ) .",
    "it is steadily increasing for decreasing temperature , as one would have expected in the vicinity of a critical point , and no plateau is seen .    in order to determine the short - time exponent @xmath5 , we calculated magnetization profiles for the lattice size @xmath137 .",
    "as also found for other models@xcite , the outcome for the short - time exponent @xmath5 varies significantly with @xmath3 . from the renormalization - group analysis it is clear @xcite that the pure scaling form ( [ power ] ) is assumed for @xmath138 only",
    "unfortunately , it is hard to obtain reliable results for @xmath5 in this limit , as for @xmath81 the signal vanishes completely , and for decreasing @xmath3 it becomes more and more blotted out by the noise .",
    "hence , as in ref.@xcite , we calculated profiles for a number of initial values @xmath3 and then determined @xmath5 by fitting a power law to the short - time regime .",

    "this is drastically different at low temperatures .",
    "e.g. for @xmath142 ( upper dashed curve ) , deep in the ferromagnetic regime , the time dependence of the magnetization is more complicated , and only for @xmath143 power - law behavior is assumed .",

    "a new feature that is not found in the ising model is a relatively slow approach to a power law of the autocorrelation function . presumably , this is due to vortices and additional length scales associated with them . from the existing literature we were not able to get a full quantitative understanding of this phenomenon , in particular in view of the relatively fast approach to the power law observed in the magnetization and its second moment .",
    "another observation concerns the exponent @xmath92 of the second moment .",
    "it turns out to be either weakly depending on the temperature or even constant .",
    "it would be interesting to study the temperature dependence of this quantity also for other values of @xmath17 and for the @xmath16 model ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "our monte carlo estimates for @xmath36 listed in the table are consistent with earlier analytical and numerical work@xcite . since @xmath2 is a derived quantity , its error is relatively large , and with the present procedure it would be hard to obtain a much smaller value .",
    "however , we believe that these results confirm our basic hypothesis that the universal short - time behavior , previously known from ising - like systems , also occurs in the kt phase . in particular this",
    "implies that there exists a new exponent @xmath173 , the anomalous dimension of the initial magnetization , that in general is different from the exponent @xmath36 of the static correlation function .",
    "this difference gives rise to the characteristic short - time behavior of the magnetization ( [ power ] ) and also leaves its fingerprint on the time dependence of the autocorrelation function @xmath86 as expressed in ( [ lambda ] ) .",
