    "the study of a subclass of hydrogen deficient supernovae , namely type ib and type ic events , has been one of the interesting topics in supernova ( sn ) research .",
    "the observational properties , progenitors , and hence the physics of explosion are the least understood for these two subclasses . the recently established connection of bright and energetic sn ic events with gamma - ray burst sources ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) makes their study interesting and exciting .",
    "type ib and ic sne are classified on the basis of their spectra .",
    "both types are hydrogen deficient at maximum light , and also lack the deep si ii absorption near 6150   , a characteristic feature of the ia events . at early phases ic s do not show lines of he i , shown by the ib s , while at later phases both types have similar spectra @xcite . the ib and",

    "supernova sn 2005bf was discovered independently by @xcite and @xcite on april 5.722 , 2005 ( ut ) , at a magnitude about 18.0 , in the sb(r)b galaxy mcg + 00 - 27 - 5 .",
    "the supernova was also marginally detected , at magnitude about 18.8 , on a image taken on mar .",
    "30.31 @xcite .",
    "early spectroscopic observations indicated the supernova to be of type ic a few days before maximum light @xcite .",
    "sn 2005bf was reported to undergo an unusual photometric behaviour by @xcite .",
    "after an initial brightening from april 7 to april 13 , the supernova declined until april 21 , after which it re - brightened to magnitudes brighter than the initial maximum ( see light curves posted at the carnegie supernova project ( csp ) group websitecspuser1/images / opticallightcurves / sn05bf.html ] ) .",
    "spectra obtained during the re - brightening @xcite indicated that the spectrum had developed conspicious lines of he i similar to type ib supernovae .",
    "also , the sn reached a bright maximum , making it an interesting target .    in this paper",
    "we present optical spectroscopy of sn 2005bf obtained near the maximum , and optical photometry during the maximum and subsequent decline .",
    "ccd photometric and spectroscopic observations were performed with the 2-m himalayan chandra telescope ( hct ) at the indian astronomical observatory ( iao ) , hanle , india using the himalaya faint object spectrograph camera ( hfosc ) .",
    "photometric observations in the bessell @xmath0 bands were made during may 3may 28 .",
    "landolt standard regions were observed on may 27 to calibrate a sequence of secondary standards in the supernova field .",
    "the magnitudes of sn 2005bf and the secondary standards in the field were obtained by point spread function photometry .",
    "the identification and magnitudes of the secondary standards in the field of sn 2005bf may be obtained from http://www.iiap.res.in/personnel/gca/sn05cal.html .",
    "the @xmath0 light curves of sn 2005bf are shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "also included in the figure with the @xmath11 magnitudes are the unfiltered ccd magnitudes reported in the iau circulars , and the estimates made by amateurs .",
    "the pre - maximum evolution of sn 2005bf was quite peculiar and different from that of other sne ib / c .",
    "sn 2005bf had a very slow rise to the maximum , which occurred around 2005 may 7 , nearly 40 days since the shock breakout .",
    "in contrast , the type ib sn 1999ex rose to maximum in about 18 days @xcite .",
    "after maximum , which was broad , sn 2005bf declined with rates of 0.07 mag  day@xmath6 , 0.038 mag  day@xmath6 , 0.05 mag  day@xmath6 and 0.014 mag  day@xmath6 in @xmath12,@xmath13,@xmath11 and @xmath14 , respectively , which are similar to the decline rates observed in sn ib sn 1999ex at similar epochs with respect to maximum .    in this paper",
    "we assume the date of explosion to be 2005 march 30 ( jd2453459.5 ) , based on @xcite and the light curve posted by the csp . a galactic reddening e(b - v )",
    "= 0.045 as estimated by @xcite in the direction of the host galaxy has been used . as the supernova occurred in one of the spiral arms of the host galaxy , reddening within the host",
    "is also expected .",
    "however , since no conspicious na i d absorption features have been reported , we assume negligible extinction due to the host galaxy . we adopt a distance modulus of @xmath15 for the host galaxy using @xmath16  km  s@xmath6  mpc@xmath6 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and a redshift of @xmath19 ( hyperleda database ) .",
    "the bolometric magnitudes were estimated by converting our @xmath0 photometry , corrected for the assumed e(b - v ) , into absolute monochromatic fluxes adopting the magnitude - to - flux conversion factors compiled by @xcite .",
    "the fluxes were then integrated using a fitting spline curve . around the light maximum ,",
    "extending the spline fit only to 3600   give bolometric magnitudes about 0.15 - 0.2 mag fainter than if the fit were extended to 3000  , while there is no significant difference around the epochs of our last observations , indicating a significant contribution by the @xmath20 flux around maximum .",
    "hence , the bolometric magnitudes are estimated with zero - flux terminals of the spline fit chosen as 3000   and 2.480 @xmath21 m in an effort to recover as much as possible the @xmath20 and near - infrared fluxes that were missed by our photometry . adding a conservative uncertainty , @xmath22 , to the bolometric magnitudes",
    ", we estimate the bolometric magnitude at maximum to be @xmath1 on may 11 ( jd2453502.1 ) .",
    "we plot in figure [ fig2 ] the evolution of the absolute magnitude in @xmath12 ( @xmath23 ) for sn 2005bf since our assumed date of explosion and compare it with other sne ib / c , namely , sn 1999ex @xcite , sn 1994i @xcite , sn 1984l @xcite and sn 1985f @xcite .",
    "the maximum bolometric magnitude ( inset in figure [ fig2 ] ) of sn 2005bf is brighter than the average value for type ib / c sne , even though the time of maximum was significantly later .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath24 colour at maximum indicates sn 2005bf to be marginally bluer .",
    "the rise time depends on the mass and the explosion energy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the slow rise suggests a relatively low ratio of explosion energy to ejected mass .",
    "a detailed modelling of the light curve and the spectra are beyond the scope of this work and will be reported in a later paper @xcite .",
    "however , preliminary calculations indicate a tentative value for the explosion energy of @xmath25 erg , and an ejected mass of @xmath26 .",
    "the brightness of the peak and its late occurrence suggest a relatively large production of @xmath4ni ( @xmath27 ) , which points to a rather massive progenitor ( @xmath28 ) @xcite .",
    "spectra of sn 2005bf were obtained at a resolution of 8    in the wavelength range 36007200   and 52009200   on may 4.65 , 6.62 , 8.63 ( ut ) ( marked by vertical lines in fig . [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "all observations were made using a slit of 2.2 arcsec width and aligned along the parallactic angle .",
    "spectrophotometric standards hz 44 and bd + 33@xmath29 2642 observed on 2005 may 4 were used to correct the supernova spectra for the response curves of the instrument and bring them to a flux scale . the spectra in the two different regions",
    "were combined , scaled to a weighted mean , to give the final spectrum on a relative flux scale , which were then brought to an absolute scale using the @xmath0 magnitudes .",
    "the flux calibrated spectra , corrected for the redshift of the host galaxy are shown in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "the three spectra presented here are all near optical maximum , but are very similar to those of sn 1984l @xcite about one week past maximum and sn 1999ex @xcite 4 days past maximum . if the phase since the date of explosion is considered , then the spectra of sn 2005bf correspond to about 35 - 39 days after explosion , while the corresponding phase is about 20 - 25 days for sn 1984l and sn 1999ex .    the spectra show prominent and broad p cygni lines of he i , fe ii , and ca ii .",
    "the he i @xmath305876 p cygni feature is strong , whose identification is supported by the presence of clear he i @xmath306678 and @xmath307065 , although na i d could also contribute .",
    "he i @xmath307281 may also exist .",
    "however , it should be noted that this feature is affected by the telluric h@xmath31o absorption , and our spectra are not corrected for the telluric features .",
    "the velocities corresponding to the absorption minima of the relatively weak he i @xmath306678 , @xmath307065 , and @xmath307281 ( if real ) have average velocities of @xmath32 6500 km  s@xmath6 , lower than that of he i @xmath305876 which is @xmath33 7300 km  s@xmath6 . the very strong p cygni feature between 3700   and 4100   and the very broad one between 8000   and 9000 are obviously ca ii h&k and the near - infrared triplet , respectively , with velocities @xmath34 10000 km  s@xmath6 , indicating that these lines have large optical depths . between 4000   and 5500  the spectra are dominated by fe ii multiplets , whose individual identifications are difficult due to the large intrinsic number of fe ii optical transitions and strong line - blending in the fast - moving sn atmosphere . nevertheless , we identify fe ii multiplet 27 ( @xmath304233 ) , 42 ( @xmath304924 , @xmath305018 , and @xmath305169 ) , and 49 ( @xmath305317 ) with velocities between @xmath33 7500 km  s@xmath6 and @xmath33 8000 km  s@xmath6 .",
    "the strong 4570feature is a complex blend of several lines of fe ii multiplets 37 and 38 , mainly @xmath354629 , 4584 , 4549 , and 4520 .",
    "the absorption velocity , calculated with respect to @xmath304520 , a strong feature in both multiplets , is consistent with other fe ii lines .",
    "the identity of the p cygni line between 6200   and 6500",
    "  is controversial .",
    "this feature , if identified as h@xmath8 , corresponds to a velocity as high as @xmath33 15000 km  s@xmath6 .",
    "if , instead , identified as si ii @xmath306355 , the measured velocity drops to @xmath36 km  s@xmath6 , which is significantly lower than all other lines .",
    "it may be noted that the uncertainty of our measurements varies from line to line and from spectrum to spectrum and can be as large as @xmath37 km  s@xmath6 , a result of the low s / n ratio , potential weak lines , and other pollution around the line absorption minima .    to further establish line identifications , we compute synthetic spectra using the fast , parameterized supernova spectrum - synthesis code , synow ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , and show the fit to the spectrum of may 4 in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "we assume a @xmath38 power law for the radial dependance of line optical depths . the photospheric velocity , @xmath39 , is assumed to be traced by the absorption minima of weak lines .",
    "we first assume @xmath40 8000 km  s@xmath6 ( _ lower thick solid line _ ) , the value that matches weak fe ii lines .",
    "as expected , fe ii and ca ii lines are well reproduced , while he i @xmath306678 and @xmath307065 absorptions are a bit bluer than the observed .",
    "the observed he i @xmath306678 , @xmath307065 , and @xmath307281 ( if real ) are also stronger than in the model .",
    "this suggests that non - thermal excitation , which is not included in synow , is important for he i. the @xmath33 6240   absorption minimum is reproduced by introducing a high - velocity h@xmath8 with a lower cut - velocity of 15,000 km s@xmath6 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the narrow absorption and flat - topped emission of the synthetic h@xmath8 profile are consequences of the artifical optical - depth discontinuity of a detached line .",
    "identification of this feature with si ii instead of h@xmath8 produces too blue an absorption minimum at 6200   ( _ dotted line _ , inset in fig .",
    "an alternative identification of the feature is with ne i @xmath306402 @xcite . a marginally discernible dip at 4630   in the fe ii peak may , if real , be explained by high - velocity h@xmath9 ( marked by _",
    "arrows _ in fig .",
    "hydrogen lines have been suggested for other ib sne ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we also computed a synthetic spectrum with @xmath40 6500 km  s@xmath6 ( _ upper thick solid line _ ) .",
    "this spectrum reproduces the positions of he i absorption minima , but fe ii absorptions are too red . as a possible solution",
    ", we tentatively introduce a lower cut - velocity of 8000 km  s@xmath6 for fe ii .",
    "one can assume fe iii dominates over fe ii below that velocity although fe iii is actually not included in our spectrum synthesis .",
    "with such a low @xmath39 , si ii @xmath306355 seemingly matches the p cygni feature between 6200   and 6500   better than the high-@xmath39 case .",
    "calculations of realistic spatial structures of ionization and excitation above the photosphere are needed to correctly identify this feature and to determine the photospheric velocity , which is beyond the ability of synow and the scope of this paper .",
    "the @xmath0 light curve and spectra of sn 2005bf around maximum are presented .",
    "the light curves indicate that the maximum occurred nearly 40 days after the date of explosion . at maximum ,",
    "sn 2005bf was brighter and bluer than other sne ib / c .",
    "the maximum phase was broad and the decline rates slow , and may be compared with the core collapse models of hydrogen - less cores .",
    "preliminary calculations suggest a core mass larger than the type ib model suggested for sn1984l @xcite .",
    "the slow rise to the maximum and the brighter peak bolometric luminosity indicate that most of @xmath4ni was buried in a relatively low velocity region in the very massive ejecta @xcite , although a small part of @xmath4ni may be mixed out @xcite . the spectra of sn 2005bf around maximum are very similar to those of the type ib sne 1999ex and 1984l about 25 - 35 days after explosion with prominent he i , fe ii , ca ii h&k and the near - ir triplet p cygni lines present",
    ". relatively weak h@xmath8 and very weak h@xmath9 may also exist , blueshifted by @xmath10 km s@xmath6 .",
    "we suggest that sn 2005bf was the explosion of a massive he star , possibly with a trace of hydrogen envelope .",
