    "metallic surfaces subject to strong electric field emit electrons into vacuum due tunneling transitions @xcite . employing the ballistic motion of emitted electrons in vacuum ,",
    "field emission has found important practical applications in development of vacuum microelectronic devices @xcite , at the same time electron emission is an unwanted phenomenon in high - voltage vacuum insulation where it is considered as precursor to breakdown @xcite . besides its technological importance and experimental interest",
    ", there remain relatively few calculations of the electron emission current using first - principles methods for description of the field - dsitroted surface electronic structure @xcite . for the field emission from high work function surfaces",
    "ref.@xcite , the calculated electron current density @xmath2 complies qualitatively the fowler - nordheim ( fn ) model @xcite , which obeys a simple dependence upon the applied electric field @xmath3 , i.e. @xmath4 , \\label{fn}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the substrate workfunction , @xmath6 designates the position of the fermi level relative to the lower edge of the valence band , @xmath7 is the planck constant and @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the charge and mass of an electron , respectively .",
    "common to such model calculations is the use of an effective one - electron potential energy appropriate for vacuum tunneling , which is obtained in the framework of density functional theory ( dft ) using the local density approximation ( lda ) for the exchange and correlation energy .",
    "a well known drawback of lda is that it fails to describe classical long - range image charge interaction between electron outside the surface and the polarization charge density that builds up at the surface in response to the coulomb field of the escaping electron .",
    "image charge interactions are also known to affect measured conductance of tunneling barriers arising in gallium - arsenide structures @xcite and play an important role in the correct interpretation of stm measurements @xcite .",
    "nordheim @xcite extended the fn model by including the coulomb interaction energy @xmath10 of an electron at a distance @xmath11 from the surface with its induced self - image charge , where @xmath12 is the vacuum permittivity constant .",
    "this was discussed further in @xcite and elaborated by murphy and good @xcite , the result for the current density including the image potential is @xmath13 , \\label{cfe}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 at @xmath15 are slowly varying functions of the nordheim parameter @xmath16 , and are related to certain linear combination of elliptic functions .",
    "thus classical image charge effects take the form of multiplicative correction to the fowler - nordheim exponent .",
    "normally it is assumed that eq.[cfe ] remains valid for more realistic electron - surface potentials , because the main effect of reduction of the surface barrier occurs at distances where the classical image potential provides reasonable approximation .",
    "thus eq.([cfe ] ) is used in the interpretation and analysis of experimental electron - emission data in terms of fowler - nordheim plot of @xmath17 as a function of the inverse field strength @xmath18 .",
    "field enhancement factor is extracted from the slope and an effective emitting area from the intercept of the fn plot .",
    "these parameters depend on the surface roughness , morphology and other specific geometrical features of the emitting surface . to investigate influence of the surface barrier shape , more refined analysis of the fn plot has been developed @xcite , where slope and intercept correction factors are introduced in order to obtain more reliable values of the emission area and the field enhancement factor",
    ".    however eq.([cfe ] ) does not describe correctly the electron - surface interaction at small distances @xmath11 , where the classical image potential energy @xmath19 diverges .",
    "within dft @xcite for a semi - infinite jellium model describing metal surface , the one - electron potential energy saturates to the local density exchange and correlation potential energy @xcite close to the surface . since electron tunneling is sensitive to the change of this potential energy , the motivation for the present work is development of more elaborate model for the surface barrier for electrons , which allows to quantify exchange and correlation effects in field emission from simple metal surfaces .",
    "the problem is simplified when the time spent by electrons under the barrier is long compared to the time required for the surface screening charges to build up @xcite , such that dynamical screening effects may be neglected and the use quasistatic approximation for image charge interactions can be justified .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we give details on our theoretical model for field emission from arbitrarily structured metallic surfaces in the framework of density functional theory ( dft ) in the thomas - fermi - von - weizscker ( tfvw ) approximation @xcite .",
