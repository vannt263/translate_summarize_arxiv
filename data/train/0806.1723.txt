    "there are many ways to solve the coupled schrodinger and poisson equations required for density functional theory .",
    "they generally fall into two classes : ( a ) finite cluster calculations using basis sets , such as gaussians , or ( b ) periodic crystal calculations , as for example those which use a plane wave basis set . within either class the nuclear attraction",
    "may be replaced by a pseudo or effective core potential .",
    "the ability to fabricate nanoscale clusters with tens of thousands of atoms has driven a renewed interest in electronic structure methods capable of reaching this size . in our research",
    "we have opted for the finite cluster approach , since many of the systems of interest fall into this category .",
    "however , the standard techniques using gaussians often require extremely large basis sets and are difficult to apply to heavy atoms .",
    "methods for treating crystals which derive from the augmented plane wave ( apw ) method are known to be extremely accurate and suitable for all atoms in the periodic table but make essential use of fourier decompositions in a way that does not scale well to massively parallel machines .",
    "in addition , they make use of supercells , which may not describe finite systems accurately .",
    "some years ago we developed an augmented basis set method which uses linearized solutions of the schrodinger ( or dirac ) equation inside atom centered spheres , and slater - type - orbitals in the region between spheres @xcite .",
    "it was based on anderson s linear muffin tin orbital method ( lmto ) @xcite but used slater type orbitals as `` tail '' functions in place of anderson s spherical bessel functions . while the method was formulated in real space , it was more cleanly coded in reciprocal space , which for crystals with small unit cells was equally efficient .",
    "we return here to the real space formulation and apply it to free standing clusters .",
    "there are a number of other real space formulations of density functional theory ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "most of these solve the schrdinger equation directly on a mesh , as for example chelikowski @xmath0 @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "an essential difference is the method for solving the poisson equation .",
    "the standard method in crystals @xcite is to replace the charge density inside the spheres by a smooth pseudo - density which has the same multipole moments as the true density ( including the nuclear charge ) and is represented by a fourier series . here",
    "we use the same idea , except we represent the pseudo - density on a ( nonuniform ) grid to enhance resolution adaptively , not globally . in addition",
    ", we use the pseudo - density only for the spherical ( monopole ) portion of the density , as the nonspherical terms can be included directly on the grid .    in either case ,",
    "one finds the solution of the poisson equation outside the spheres and interpolates onto the sphere boundaries to define a dirichlet problem for the potential inside which can be solved using the true density .",
    "in this section , we consider the kohn - sham approach in real space for electronic structure calculations .",
    "we consider the schrdinger equation @xmath2 \\varphi_k(\\bold x ) = \\epsilon_k\\varphi_k(\\bold x),\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the potential , which consists of the external potential @xmath4 , the hartree potential @xmath5 , and the exchange and correlation potential @xmath6 .",
    "we use atomic units where lengths are measured in units of the bohr radius @xmath7 @xmath8 and energies in hartrees @xmath9 @xmath10 .",
    "the external potential @xmath4 is typically a sum of nuclear potentials centered at the atomic positions .",
    "the hartree potential @xmath5 can be obtained by solving the poisson equation @xmath11 with @xmath12 where @xmath13 where @xmath14 s are the center of atoms and @xmath15 s are the nuclear charge .",

    "we use local spin density ( lsd ) of the hedin - lundqvist form @xcite and generalized gradient approximations ( gga ) of perdew , burke , wang and ernzerhof , ( pbe - gga)@xcite . the gga approximation is generally considered to be more accurate and we confirm this view in our work .    due to the functional dependence of @xmath20 on the density",
