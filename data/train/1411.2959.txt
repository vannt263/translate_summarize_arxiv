    "a quantum affine algebra @xmath0 is a hopf algebra over the field of rational functions @xmath1 and can be viewed as a deformation of the universal enveloping of an _ affine lie algebra _ @xmath2 .",
    "it is a special case of the drinfeld - jimbo quantum group and the next logical step after quantum groups associated to finite - dimensional lie algebras @xmath2 .",
    "lusztig has in @xcite studied an integral form in this situation , which is a hopf algebra @xmath3,{\\mathcal{l}}}({\\mathfrak{g}})$ ] over the ring @xmath4 $ ] , and one may again perform a specialization to a specific value @xmath5 and thus obtain a complex hopf algebra @xmath6 . for @xmath7",
    "not a root of unity these algebras behave similar to @xmath0 but for @xmath7 an @xmath8-th root of unity , the algebra and its representation theory becomes significantly more interesting .",
    "the theory of quantum affine algebras is much less developed than the theory for finite lie algebras @xmath2 - lusztig proves several structural results in @xcite with certain restrictions on the order of @xmath7 ; among others he defined a `` small quantum group '' @xmath9 ( which is now infinite - dimensional ) and a frobenius - homomorphism to the ordinary universal enveloping algebra of @xmath2 .",
    "+ notable subsequent results were a pbw - basis established in @xcite and a complete description of the representation theory of the drinfeld jimbo quantum group in @xcite and for the specialization in @xcite , both for @xmath2 an untwisted affine lie algebra . among others",
    "they prove a factorization theorem of representations into representations of the ordinary universal enveloping algebra of @xmath2 and representations with highest weight `` less then @xmath8 '' .",
    "this is analogous to the respective results for finite - dimensional @xmath2 ( and to the steinberg factorization theorem for lie groups over finite fields ) and closely related to the frobenius homomorphism . in @xcite",
    "the study was extended to twisted affine lie algebras . as an application",
    ", the authors mention that e.g. the symmetry of the affine toda field theories are governed by quantum affine algebras and they voice the hope that their study could help understand affine toda theories with certain specific values of the coupling constant .",
    "+ the aim of this article is to clarify the hopf algebra structure of the restricted specialization @xmath6 to such values @xmath7 where lusztig s restrictions on @xmath7 are _",
    "violated_. for these _ small roots of unity _ , the quantum group severely degenerates .",
    "the author has in @xcite performed such a study already in the case of @xmath2 a finite lie algebra and found a similar frobenius homomorphism to a universal enveloping algebra . in these degenerate cases , neither the kernel nor the image of the frobenius homomorphism",
    "are associated to the initial lie algebra @xmath2 . as an application we noted in @xcite that e.g. the case @xmath10",
    "seem to be closely related to the vertex algebra of @xmath11 symplectic fermions ; here the kernel of the frobenius homomorphism is a small quantum group of type @xmath12 and the image is the universal enveloping of @xmath13 .",
    "it is to be expected that a similar study for affine @xmath2 would explain exceptional behaviour for affine toda field theories at certain small values of the coupling constants .",
    "+ in this article we concentrate on the study of the kernel of the ( yet - to - be constructed ) frobenius homomorphism for affine @xmath2 . more precisely , we define a suitable hopf subalgebra @xmath14 and describe its structure .",
    "it turns out to be mostly governed by subsystems of the dual root system , while in several exotic cases the quantum group itself changes into a quantum group associated to a different lie algebra of larger rank . in one set of cases it even collapses to an infinite tower of quantum groups of finite lie algebras .",
    "altogether we find :    let @xmath2 be an affine lie algebra and @xmath7 and @xmath8-th root of unity .",
    "we shall define a hopf subalgebra @xmath15 with the following properties :    * @xmath16 consists of all degrees ( roots ) @xmath17 with @xmath18 . * except for cases marked _",

    "mostly we find that @xmath30 is significantly smaller than @xmath31 ( in terms of real roots ) and we thus successively add new primitive elements ( some using lemma , some by guess - and - check ) until we account for all roots @xmath17 with @xmath18 .",

    "the given alternative set of generators and relations for @xmath173 is essentially due to drinfeld and emphasizes the construction of @xmath2 from a loop algebra ( see @xcite thm 4.7 ) : + let @xmath174 again denote the index set of the finite lie algebra associated to @xmath2 , then we have generators ( `` root vectors '' ) @xmath175 in degree @xmath176 and @xmath177 in degree @xmath178 and @xmath179 in degree @xmath180 .",

    "we finally give some open questions that the author would find interesting : + regarding the subsystem of long roots :          * is the surjection @xmath204 also for twisted affine @xmath2 an isomorphism ? by construction this is true on the level of roots , but there seems at present to be no pbw - basis available in this case .",
    "* are there nontrivial liftings in the exotic cases ?",
    "it seems this would require explicit calculations . * present @xmath14 as a quotient of the drinfeld double of @xmath16 .",
    "more generally , describe the affine quantum groups in terms of coradical filtration , nichols algebra and a drinfeld double construction .",
    "can the representations be related to the yetter - drinfeld modules of the borel part ?",
    "can one clarify the impact of the second condition ( odd cycles ) in @xcite ?",
    "the hopf subalgebras @xmath14 constructed in this article are a good candidate for the kernel of a _",
    "frobenius homomorphism_. in cases where we have a frobenius homomorphism , namely @xcite for sufficiently large @xmath7 and @xcite for the remaining small @xmath7 and finite root system , it coincides .",
    "is it possible to extend the approach in @xcite , namely showing normality of this @xmath14 and then analyzing the quotient , to construct a frobenius homomorphism for affine quantum groups for arbitrary @xmath7 ?",
    "it is to be expected that the quotient is _ not _ simply the universal enveloping of the same lie algebra .",
    "* we have constructed a map @xmath205 with coinciding @xmath206 . however , for @xmath207 the multiplicities are @xmath208 while for @xmath209 they are as usual @xmath210 .",
    "a similar effect occurs for @xmath211 .",
    "this could mean two both unlikely things : either the map is not injective ( but this is absurd for a map from a nichols algebra ) or the isotropic root multiplicities in @xmath212 are not as for @xmath207 .",
    "this would be surprising , but note that the root system itself does not determine the multiplicities , they are rather calculate from the twisted presentation . * in the exotic cases there seems a systematic behaviour : take as example @xmath91 at @xmath163 which has a @xmath109 root system with @xmath213 .",
    "the isotropic root multiplicities are @xmath214 respectively @xmath215 - they seem just to be shifted , the same hold for the other exotic cases . now",
    ": one can easily obtain primitive elements ( with trivial self - braiding ) for the first isotropic roots in @xmath91 , especially they are not in @xmath109 , and they turn out to still reside `` inside '' the first set of commutator relations .",

    "are their powers or other commutators than the elements in degree @xmath216 we observe in @xmath109 ?",
    "let @xmath217 a subset of simple roots , then we have a parabolic subalgebra @xmath218 of finite type and @xmath219 and @xmath220 . by the radford projection theorem",
    "we can view @xmath16 as a hopf algebra in the category of @xmath221-yetter - drinfeld modules ( hence morally a module over @xmath222 , which is finite - dimensional ) .",
    "it would be extremely interesting to study this source of infinite - dimensional representations of finite quantum groups .",
    "the representation should decompose into infinitely many finite - dimensional modules associated to the finite root strings in @xmath2 .",
    "are there certain small values for the coupling constants in affine toda theory such that the symmetry is described by the quantum affine algebras constructed here ?",
