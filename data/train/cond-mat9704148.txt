    "for instance , we should calculate the partition functions up to the lattice - size of @xmath85 either in the standard algorithm or in the improved algorithm . in the standard algorithm ,",
    "the partition function with @xmath86 is needed for this maximum size of the lattice . on the other hand , in the improved algorithm",

    "this can be understood by noticing from eqs .",
    "( [ eqa])-([eqe ] ) that the series expansion of the @xmath103 for arbitrary @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath33 with @xmath106 starts from the order that is higher than @xmath1 and does not contribute to the expansion series to the order of @xmath1 .",

    "the infiniteness of the critical value for the second - order phase transition sometimes makes the analysis easier ; if the physical quantity would have a strong singularity , we would be able to determine the critical exponent with a satisfactory accuracy by the differential approximations such as the pad analysis .    on the other hand , in the case of the first - order phase transition , we have to integrate the differential approximants to determine the critical amplitude .",
    "this integration , however , has a subtle problem discussed below , and as a result , we must choose the approximants carefully .    in analyzing the expansion series",
    ", we use homogeneous or inhomogeneous first order differential approximants @xcite , in which the approximants to a function @xmath108 satisfy @xmath109 here , @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 are polynomials of order @xmath113 , @xmath114 , and @xmath39 , respectively , which are determined so that eq .",

    "for the first order phase transition , the denominator @xmath110 of @xmath120 has in most cases a zero close to the critical point .",
    "the zero point is usually slightly above the critical point on the real axis of @xmath51 .",
    "it is sometimes , however , below the critical point , then the integral of @xmath120 will diverge and we should abandon such an approximant .",
    "even if the zero point is above the critical point , it is so close to the critical point that its subtle fluctuation makes the fluctuation of the critical value @xmath121 rather large .    at first , in order to examine the accuracy of the analysis of the series described above , we apply it to the free energy density @xmath122 at the critical point ( @xmath123 ) , the latent heat @xmath124 and the magnetization gap @xmath125 , whose exact values were obtained by baxter @xcite . in table",
    "[ tab : estimates ] the estimates of the free energy density , latent heat and magnetization gap from the longest series ( @xmath126 ) are presented for @xmath127 , and their exact values are in parentheses .",
    "these estimates obtained by the analysis of the series may contain errors by two reasons ; one of them is the statistical fluctuation among the approximants with the different orders @xmath128 and @xmath39 of the polynomials @xmath110 and @xmath111 in eq .",
    "( [ inhomo ] ) but with the same order @xmath116 of the original series .",
    "about these statistical errors we find two common tendency ; i ) if the order @xmath39 is too large , the convergence of the approximants is not so good , and if the orders @xmath113 and @xmath114 are too small , the integral of @xmath120 diverges frequently , therefore we restrict the order @xmath39 to be @xmath129 ( d - log pad approximant ) or @xmath130  6 ( inhomogeneous differential approximants ) and the orders @xmath113 and @xmath114 to satisfy @xmath131 .",
    "ii ) for smaller @xmath0 , some approximants are finite at the critical point but apparently far from the exact value , then we must exclude them .",
    "we present only the statistical errors in table  [ tab : estimates ] .",
    "the other error is from the finiteness of the series . if there is discrepancy between an estimate for the finite series and the corresponding exact value beyond the statistical error for each @xmath116 , we may say that the discrepancy is caused by the finiteness of the series and the error arising from the finiteness of the series has the order of magnitude of this discrepancy .",
    "now , we present the result of the individual analysis for the free energy density , the latent heat and the magnetization gap .    for the free energy density @xmath122 ,",
    "both the inhomogeneous and homogeneous differential approximants give well - converged results , the latter converging more excellently .",
    "the data in table  [ tab : estimates ] are from the latter . for @xmath132 ,",
    "the estimates from the d - log pad approximants agree with the exact value within one standard deviation . on the other hand , for @xmath133 ,",
    "the estimates are larger than the exact value , and do not agree with it within one standard deviation . as an example in fig.4",
    ", we present a plot of the estimates for @xmath89 versus the number @xmath116 of terms of the truncated series .",
    "the difference between the estimates and the exact value is about 0.01 percent while the fluctuation of the approximants is about 0.005 percent , the former is about 2 times larger than the latter .",
    "the ratio of the difference between the estimate and the exact value to the statistical fluctuation becomes larger for smaller @xmath0 .",
    "nevertheless , the figure also exhibits the tendency that the difference between the estimates and the exact value decreases with the increase of the number of terms .",
    "( we should mention that the errorbars for @xmath134 are relatively small .",
    "it is because , for these @xmath116 , some approximants have divergent integral of @xmath120 and the remaining fewer approximants happen to be very close . ) therefore , this difference can be expected to shrink for longer series .",
    "it would , however , be difficult to extrapolate the data to @xmath135 to estimate the exact value , if it were not known , since we do not know what asymptotic behavior the approximants should follow with respect to @xmath116 . for the latent heat ,",
    "the inhomogeneous differential approximants give more convergent results than the d - log pad approximants , in contrast with the case of the free energy density .",
    "then , by using the inhomogeneous differential approximants , we can obtain about 60 estimates of the latent heat for each model with @xmath127 . for @xmath136 ,",
    "the estimates coincide with the exact value within one standard deviation . for @xmath137 , although the estimates do not agree with the exact value within one standard deviation , we find that their difference becomes smaller for larger number of terms of the expansion series and so we can say that the difference would disappear for long enough series , as in the previous case of the free energy density .    for the magnetization gap ,",
    "about 10 estimates obtained by the d - log pad approximants converge well for each @xmath0 , while those obtained by the inhomogeneous differential approximants do not .",
    "although it does not agree with the exact value within one standard deviation except for @xmath138 , the estimates themselves are very close to the exact value ; for example , in the case of @xmath89 , the difference between the estimates and the exact value is about 0.015 percent .",
    "further fig.5 shows that the differences would disappear for larger number of terms as well as in the case of the free energy density and the latent heat .    now using the same method as the above",
    ", we estimate the values of the susceptibility and specific heat at the critical point , whose exact values are not known .",
    "the behavior of the differential approximants for the susceptibility is like that for the magnetization gap .",
    "the d - log pad approximants for the susceptibility show better convergence than the inhomogeneous approximants , although the errors of the estimates for the susceptibility are larger than those for the magnetization gap .",
    "the estimates from the longest series ( @xmath126 ) are listed in table  [ tab : estimates2 ] , and our estimates for @xmath139 are consistent with the estimates obtained by briggs _ et al_@xcite . for @xmath140 , 15 , 20 ,",
    "monte carlo estimates are given by janke _",
    "et al_@xcite . as their definition of the susceptibility",
    "is different from ours in the normalization factor , the results in ref  @xcite should multiplied by a factor of @xmath141 to fit into our definition .",

    "although there are differences over one standard deviation , which are especially large for @xmath140 , we may expect that the differences would disappear for larger @xmath0 .",
    "for the specific heat , the estimates obtained by the d - log pad approximants give well converging results , while the inhomogeneous differential approximants do not .",
    "we list the estimates from the longest series ( @xmath126 ) by the d - log pad approximants in table  [ tab : estimates3 ] .",
    "the errors of the estimates for the specific heat are smaller than those for the susceptibility",
    ". nevertheless , our estimates for @xmath139 are inconsistent with the estimates obtained by briggs _",
    "et al_@xcite .",
    "therefore we should check the validity of our approximants in some way .",
    "fortunately , by the duality relation @xcite , we can obtain the exact value of the gap of the specific heat as follows@xcite ; @xmath149 in table  [ tab : estimates3 ] , we also list the estimates of the gap of the specific heat , where the specific heat @xmath150 is calculated using the high - temperature expansion series obtained from the low - temperature series by the duality .",
    "it is clear that for @xmath151 there exists the gap of the specific heat and more over almost all the estimated values of the gap of the specific heat coincide with the exact values given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : gap ] ) within the standard deviation .",
    "therefore , we convince the validity of our estimates for the specific heat .    finally we compare our estimates of the specific heat at the critical point with the estimates obtained from the large-@xmath0 expansion series that was recently obtained by bhattacharya _",

    "our estimates from the low - temperature series are systematically smaller than the estimates from the large-@xmath0 expansion . in fig.6 and 7 ,",
    "we present a plot of the estimates of the specific heat @xmath154 for @xmath89 and @xmath105 , respectively , versus the number @xmath116 of the terms of the series truncated .",
    "we can see that the estimates are approaching the result of the large-@xmath0 expansion from below for each @xmath0 and that they approach faster for larger @xmath0 .",
    "thus we can expect that , if we extrapolate the estimates in some way to @xmath135 for each @xmath0 , we would obtain the estimates that may be more consistent with the result of the large-@xmath0 expansion , although we do not know how to make the extrapolation correctly , as mentioned above .",
