    "there is considerable interest in the basic science and technological applications of quantum dots [ 1 - 5].the electron motion in quantum dots are confined to a region with dimensions comparable to the de broglie wavelength of the particle.the result is the quantization of energy . however , since the quantization in the vertical direction is much stronger than in the planar directions , a quantum dot can well be treated as a 2d disc of finite radius .",
    "although quantum dots and natural atoms contain comparable number of electrons , their electronic properties can have gross differences due to the nature of the confinement potential [ 6].in quantum dots confinement potential is experimentally controllable [ 4 ] , and usually parabolic and much shallower than the @xmath4 potential of the natural atoms.one recalls , however , that parabolic structures are not the only ones because hard wall type confinement can also be obtained by etching techniques [ 7 - 10 ] .",
    "electron electron correlations in quantum dots have been worked out for parabolic and hard wall confinements in the classical limit and finite temperature in [ 11 ] , and for hard wall confinement at zero temperature in [ 12 ] .    in this work",
    "we perform an exact numerical analysis of a few electrons confined in a circular 2d quantum dot .",
    "we believe that such analyses of 2d structures can shed light on the nature of the electron correlations in quantum dots .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows.in sec .",
    "2 we formulate the second quantized hamiltonian and specify its symmetries . in sec .",
    "3 we perform a numerical diagonalization of the hamiltonian obtained its energy levels as a function of the dot dimension .",
    "we also present a comparative analysis of the quantum mechanical and classical energy levels .",
    "we consider a many electron system in a two - dimensional circular quantum dot with radius @xmath1.the system is described by the hamiltonian @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the electron effective mass and @xmath7 is the dielectric constant of the medium.the second term in the paranthesis , @xmath8 , is the hard - wall confinement potential which vanishes for @xmath9 , and infinite for @xmath10.for convenience , we introduce the dimensionless hamiltonian @xmath11 via the definition @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the dimensionless coupling constant.the dimensionless hamiltonian @xmath11 is given by @xmath14 one notes that energy is measured in units of @xmath15 which depends on @xmath3 , and length is measured in units of @xmath1 , the dot radius .    in the second quantized language",
    ", the dimensionless hamiltonian takes the form @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the single particle energy level , and @xmath18 is the matrix element of the coulombic interaction term in ( 3).here @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) is the single particle eigenstate of the free hamiltonian , and @xmath21 is a collective index designating the radial ( @xmath22 ) , angular momentum ( @xmath23 ) and spin ( @xmath24 ) quantum numbers.solution of the eigenvalue problem for the free hamiltonian yields @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the spin wavefunction , and @xmath27 is the normalized orbital eigenfunction given by @xmath28 with the eigenvalues @xmath29 which is independent of both spin and the sign of @xmath30 .",
    "here @xmath31 are the zeroes of the bessel function ( @xmath32 ) .    in determining the spectrum of the total hamiltonian in ( 3 ) , it would be convenient to find a representation for the coulombic potential @xmath33 in terms of bessel functions , as the single particle eigenstates in ( 7 ) do depend only on the bessel functions .",
    "accordingly , we use the following decomposition for @xmath34 @xmath35 where we let @xmath36 as the vertical dimension of the dot is vanishingly small .    by inserting the equations ( 6 ) , ( 7 ) and ( 8) into equation ( 5 ) ,",
    "we obtain the final form of the spin independent potential matrix element @xmath37 as follows @xmath38    integration over the azimuthal angle @xmath39 in ( 5 ) drops the sum over @xmath30 in ( 8) , and the difference between the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers becomes the order of the bessel function.in ( 9 ) @xmath40 and @xmath41 arise from such angular integrations , and unlike the other bessel functions in ( 9 ) , they have negative or positive order index . as @xmath42 and @xmath43 , these two bessel functions create sign differences among different potential matrix elements .",
    "from the symmetries of the problem it is seen that the @xmath44 component of the total spin @xmath45 and the @xmath44 component of the orbital angular momentum @xmath46 are conserved quantum numbers.the diagonalization of the hamiltonian is done in the single particle basis by taking the constraints coming from the conservation of z component of total spin and orbital angular momentum.hence , dimension of the total hamiltonian matrix depends on @xmath47 and @xmath48 . in the next section",
    "we shall present the result of the exact diagonalization of the many body hamiltonian matrix for 2 , 3 and 4 electrons .",
    "in this section we present the @xmath3 dependence of the ground state energies for 2 , 3 and 4 electrons.for each electron number we consider certain values of @xmath47 and @xmath48.in the figures below we plot the ground state energy of the dimensionless hamiltonian @xmath11 in ( 3 ) as a function of @xmath3 .    the dimensionless coupling constant @xmath3 measures the dot dimension in units of bohr radius.in plotting the figures we shall vary @xmath3 from 0 to 3.for @xmath49 one can analyze this problem using perturbation theory as was already done in [ 13].however when @xmath3 exceeds unity perturbation theory methods do not work , and one has to resort to some other technique , such as numerical diagonalization.hence , ground state energies will be obtained by the exact diagonalization of the dimensionless many body hamiltonian .    in fig.1 depicted",
    "is the @xmath3 dependence of the ground state energy for 2 electrons.here solid curve is for @xmath50 ( @xmath51 , @xmath52 ) , dashed curve for @xmath53 ( @xmath54 , @xmath52 ) , and short - dashed curve for @xmath55 ( @xmath54 , @xmath56 ) .",
    "fig.2 displays the @xmath3 dependence of the ground state energy for 3 electrons.in this figure curves correspond to the ground state energies of @xmath57 ( @xmath58 , @xmath59 ) ( solid curve ) , @xmath60 ( @xmath61 , @xmath59 ) ( short - dashed curve ) , @xmath62 ( @xmath63 , @xmath59 ) ( dashed curve ) , and @xmath64 ( @xmath61 , @xmath65 ) ( dotted curve ) .    in fig.3 we present the case of 4",
    "electrons.the solid curve is for @xmath66 ( @xmath67 , @xmath52 ) , dashed curve for @xmath68 ( @xmath51 , @xmath52 ) , short - dashed curve for @xmath69 ( @xmath54 , @xmath52 ) , dotted curve for @xmath70 ( @xmath51 , @xmath56 ) , and dot - dashed curve for @xmath71 ( @xmath54 , @xmath56 ) .",
    "as is seen in these three figures , our exact diagonalization results are comparable with those ones which are obtained from perturbation theory [ 13].however , there are some differences between our numerical results and perturbative results.for instance , @xmath53 state in fig.1 and @xmath60 state in fig.2 are energetically more favoured than @xmath55 and @xmath64 states , respectively . also in fig.3 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 states are more stable than @xmath70 and @xmath71 respectively",
    ".    it might be interesting to compare the exact diagonalization results with those of the classical considerations.modelling the quantum dot by an isolated conducting disc with the capacitance @xmath72 one gets the classical interaction energy @xmath73 , in units of @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the number of electrons.in fig.4 we present the @xmath3 dependence of the quantum mechanical interaction energies for @xmath50 ( solid curve ) , @xmath57 ( dashed curve ) and @xmath68 ( short dashed curve ) in units of @xmath74 .",
    "the dotted curve in this figure corresponds to the classical interaction energy .",
    "in fact , we see that exact diagonalization results always remain below the classical result [ 13 ] , and approach to it for large @xmath3 values.one further observes that for small @xmath3 values , quantum mechanical and classical results behave differently , as opposed to the case of large @xmath3 .",
    "this can be attributed to the effect of electron - electron correlations , which implies that the ground state energy can not be written as the sum of the contributions of kinetic energy and interaction potential [ 12 ] .",
    "figure 5 shows the dependence of the dimensionless ground state energy per particle , @xmath76 , on the particle number @xmath75 for different @xmath3 values.for small @xmath3 values , @xmath76 deviates from a linear behaviour due to the dominance of the free hamiltonian.on the other hand , when the interaction potential becomes dominant with increasing @xmath3 value , @xmath76 changes almost linearly with @xmath75 , as is observed in the figure .",
    "in conclusion , we have worked out the exact diagonalization of the total hamiltonian for 2 , 3 and 4 electrons in a 2d circular quantum dot as a function of the dot dimension.our results approximately agree with those of the perturbation theory for small radii , but disaggrement sets in for larger radii.we have also compared exact diagonalization results with the classical predictions , and found that they almost coincide for large @xmath3 values .",
