    "understanding the reionization of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) is one of the most important issues in cosmology .",
    "the end of the hydrogen reionization epoch is probably at @xmath5 which is inferred from qsos ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , lyman @xmath6 emitters ( laes ) @xcite , and gamma - ray bursts @xcite at the redshift .",
    "future 21 cm tomography will reveal the ionization history of hydrogen in detail ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . even after we know the history",
    ", however , the problem of the ionising source may remain still open .",
    "we have not found many objects at @xmath7 so far @xcite .",
    "moreover , we do not know the lyman continuum ( lyc ) emissivity of high-@xmath8 objects .",
    "galaxies are thought to be more probable source for the hydrogen reionization than qsos ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite found that the lyc emissivity relative to non - ionising ultraviolet ( uv ) ( or escape fraction of lyc ) should increase by an order of magnitude from @xmath9 to @xmath10 so as to match the observed uv luminosity density of galaxies with the hydrogen ionization rate estimated from lyman @xmath6 forest .",
    "this trend is consistent with a remarkable contrast between @xmath11 and @xmath12 in direct observations of lyc from galaxies ; there is no detection of lyc at @xmath11 @xcite , but a marginal exception @xcite , whereas there are direct detections of lyc from lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) and laes at @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "this evolving escape fraction is also found in a simulation of galaxy formation with the radiative transfer @xcite .",
    "the latest observations with the subaru telescope have found laes emitting extremely strong lyc @xcite . indeed , some of them are brighter in lyc ( @xmath13  ) than in uv ( @xmath14  ) .",
    "such extreme `` blue '' colours can not be explained by standard stellar populations with a salpeter initial mass function @xcite .",
    "if we estimated the escape fraction for them , we would obtain a value larger than unity .",
    "this shows our poor knowledge of lyc emissivity and spectrum of galaxies .",
    "we should consider the lyc spectrum of star - forming galaxies more carefully .",
    "this paper examines effects of nebular emission on the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of galaxies .",
    "such studies have been made so far by several authors @xcite .",
    "however , we take into account , for the first time , an escape of nebular lyc from photo - ionized nebulae and galaxies .",
    "the nebular lyc is usually assumed to be absorbed within the nebulae , the so - called `` on - the - spot '' approximation @xcite .",
    "this is a very good treatment for `` photon - bounded '' nebulae from which no lyc escapes .",
    "if stellar lyc escapes from `` matter - bounded '' nebulae and escapes from galaxies as observed at @xmath12 , however , nebular lyc may also escape .",
    "we discuss this latter case here .",
    "the rest of this paper consists of four sections . in section 2 , we describe modelling procedures : stellar population models , calculations of nebular emission , and igm attenuation .",
    "the predicted spectral energy distributions , 900  - to-1500   luminosity density ratios , and other results are presented in section 3 . in section 4 ,",
    "we discuss validity of assumptions made in modelling and a few implications from the results .",
    "the final section is devoted to the conclusion .",
    "we use population synthesis models taken from literature .",
    "parameters characterising seds of galaxies are metallicity and initial mass function ( imf ) as well as star formation history and age .",
    "motivated by the discovery of laes emitting very strong lyc @xcite , we consider stellar populations emitting lyc as strongly as possible .",
    "thus , we consider very young age of 1 myr after an instantaneous burst , except for  3.2 where we also consider a continuous star formation with a longer age .",
    "the metallicity assumed here is @xmath15 which is 1/50 of the solar metallicity and the lowest one available in the code starburst99 version 5.1 @xcite .",
    "then , we consider two imf slopes of @xmath16 @xcite and @xmath17 ( extremely top - heavy ) .",
    "we call this two models a and b , respectively . the mass range is assumed to be 1100 @xmath2 for both models .",
    "in addition , we consider two more cases : @xmath18 ( extremely metal - poor [ emp ] stars ; @xcite ) and @xmath19 ( metal - free or population - iii stars ) with the salpeter imf slope and 50500 @xmath2 . these models are taken from @xcite and called c and d , respectively .",
    "table 1 is a summary of the stellar population models considered in this paper .",
    ".models of stellar population and sed . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath20 @xmath21 k , @xmath22 + @xmath23",
    "@xmath21 k , @xmath24 +    in table  2 we summarize the coefficients for @xmath25 in equation ( 11 ) and the mean photon energy of nebular lyc as a function of @xmath26 .",
    "table  3 gives a summary of mean photon energies of stellar lyc for models a  d in the first row .",
    "the second and third rows in table  3 show mean photon energies of escaping stellar+nebular lyc for two cases of @xmath21 k and @xmath22 or 0.1 .",
    "we find that the energy reduction is about 515% for these cases and its maximum is 1020% at the limit of @xmath27 .",
    "as described in  2.2.1 , lyc opacity through a clumpy ism is independent of wavelength . as an opposite limit",
    ", we here consider a homogeneous ism where the opacity keeps the wavelength dependence of the photo - ionization cross section of hydrogen : @xmath28 .",
    "k and the age of 1 myr after an instantaneous burst for the stellar population model d are assumed .",
    "the dotted line is the escaping stellar+nebular spectrum with a constant escape fraction @xmath29 which is the same as in figures 3 and 4 .",
    "the long - dashed line is the escaping stellar+nebular spectra for which we assume the neutral hydrogen optical depth at the lyman limit @xmath30 and at shorter wavelengths to be @xmath28 .",
    "the solid and short - dashed lines are the cases calculated with cloudy 08.00 ( ferland et al .",
    "1998 ) for hydrogen only case and hydrogen and helium case , respectively .",
    "the lyman limit optical depth for the hydrogen only case is matched to 0.68.,width=264 ]    figure  9 shows escaping stellar+nebular spectra relative to the stellar one in a homogeneous ism ( lyc opacity depends on the cube of wavelength ) for the model d. the lyman limit optical depth is set to be 0.68 .",
    "this opacity corresponds to @xmath22 at the lyman limit and is applied to both stellar and nebular lyc ( long - dashed line ) .",
    "if we compare the case in a clumpy ism presented in the previous sections ( dotted line ) , we find that the lyman limit bump predicted in a homogeneous ism is weaker than that in a clumpy ism .",
    "this is because higher energy lyc escapes easily and does not convert to nebular emission in the wavelength dependent case ( i.e. homogeneous ism ) . to make a strong bump , we need to convert higher energy lyc to the lyman limit by clumpy nebulae .",
    "we can use the public photo - ionization code , cloudy @xcite for a homogeneous ism . to check our nebular calculations ,",
    "we compare our results with the code cloudy in figure  9 .",
    "we input the following condition to the code : a point source with the production rate of hydrogen lyc photons of @xmath31 s@xmath32 , which corresponds to @xmath33 @xmath2 in the stellar mass for the model d , resides at the center of spherical symmetric gas with the hydrogen atomic number density of 1 @xmath34 and with the temperature of @xmath33 k. we set the inner and outer boundaries to be @xmath35 cm and @xmath36 cm , respectively .",
    "the outer boundary is determined to achieve a lyman limit optical depth of 0.68 .",
    "this case is shown by the solid line in figure  9 .",
    "we find a good agreement between our calculation ( long - dashed ) and cloudy ( solid ) .",
    "however , cloudy predicts somewhat stronger bump at the lyman limit .",
    "this is because the optical depth for nebular lyc is smaller than that for stellar one since the nebula surrounds the source , whereas we set the same optical depth for both continua .",
    "the short - dashed line in figure  9 is the case where the spherical gas consists of hydrogen and helium .",
    "other settings are the same as the hydrogen only case .",
    "the resultant continuum is not very different from the hydrogen only case .",
    "thus , the effect of helium is small for the shape of the sed .",
    "this point is also discussed in the next subsection .",
    "we can derive equations for helium nebular emissions like equation ( 4 ) for hydrogen .",
    "the strength of the helium emissions relative to that of hydrogen can be approximated to @xmath37 where @xmath38 is neutral helium ( he i ) or singly ionized helium ( he ii ) and other quantities have the same meanings as in  2 but with superscript describing which atom or ion . in the four models of a ",
    "d considered here , we found @xmath390.7 and @xmath400.1 with a larger value for a smaller metallicity @xcite .",
    "the recombination rates of helium are @xmath41 and @xmath42 @xcite . according to the emission coefficients shown in @xcite",
    ", we found that the helium contribution is negligible in the wavelength range of 8002000  , except for the model d where the he ii bound - free paschen continuum contributes about 20% around 2000  .",
    "this smallness of the effect of helium on continuum can be confirmed in figure  9 if we look at the result by cloudy with hydrogen and helium ( short - dashed line ) .",
    "however , the effect on recombination lines may not be negligible .",
    "as shown in figure  4 , we predict that galaxies dominated by very young ( @xmath0 myr ) and massive stellar populations can have a lyman limit `` bump '' not `` break '' expected in the stellar spectra .",
    "the strength of the bump depends on the hardness of the lyc ( see also figure  6 ) .",
    "if galaxies contain very massive ( @xmath1 @xmath2 ) emp stars or metal - free ( pop - iii ) stars , the lyman limit bump becomes very strong .",
    "this fact provides a new method to find such exotic stellar populations in galaxies at @xmath43 although the igm attenuation hampers us to use this method for galaxies at @xmath10 .",
    "indeed , @xcite have found very interesting laes at @xmath44 which emit extremely strong lyc .",
    "we will apply the model developed in this paper to the laes in the forthcoming paper and discuss their nature in detail .",
    "let us examine if escaping nebular lyc affects the reionization process .",
    "the reionization history is regulated by the product of escape fraction and star formation efficiency , @xmath45 , if we assume a cosmological structure formation scenario @xcite . as the first effect of escaping nebular lyc , this @xmath46 should be replaced by `` effective '' escape fraction , @xmath47 , which is introduced in equation ( 8) and figure  8 . from equations ( 8) and ( 11 )",
    ", we obtain @xmath48 and find that the `` effective '' escape fraction is at most a factor of 1.6 larger than @xmath46 for @xmath21 k. as the second effect , the nebular lyc modifies the lyc spectral shape and reduces the mean photon energy of escaping lyc .",
    "this leads to a decrease of the mean free path of lyc photons in the igm .",
    "however , the reduction of the mean photon energy is at most 1020% relative to that of the stellar lyc as discussed in  3.4 and in tables  2 and 3 .",
    "therefore , the nebular lyc escape itself may not give a significant impact on the reionization process .",
    "the discovery of @xmath44 laes emitting extremely strong lyc by the subaru telescope @xcite requires us to examine lyc emissivity and spectrum of galaxies more carefully . as an attempt",
    ", this paper has examined the effect of an escape of nebular lyc on seds of galaxies .",
    "the nebular lyc mainly emitted by bound - free transitions of hydrogen is usually assumed to be absorbed within nebulae , so - called `` on - the - spot '' approximation @xcite .",
    "however , we should consider its escape if stellar lyc escapes from galaxies as observed at @xmath49 @xcite .    since the bound - free nebular emission has strong peaks at the limits of lyman , balmer , paschen , etc .",
    "( see figure  2 ) , we expect a bump at the lyman limit due to escaping nebular bound - free lyc ( see figure  3 ) .",
    "this bump boosts luminosity density at 900  . as a result ,",
    "900  - to-1500   luminosity density ratio can become larger than that expected in stellar seds .",
    "indeed , the ratio has a maximum not when @xmath50 but when @xmath51 ( see figure  6 ) .",
    "the strength of the bump depends on @xmath26 in nebulae ( see figure  5 ) , hardness of stellar lyc ( i.e. metallicity , imf and mass range , and age ; see figures  3 and 7 ) , and igm attenuation ( see figure  4 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the total number of lyc photons which escape from galaxies is always less than that produced by stars ( see figure  8) .",
    "in fact , the lyman limit bump is a result of the radiation energy re - distribution by nebulae .",
    "the energy re - distribution reduces the mean energy of escaping lyc photons , but it is at most 1020% reduction relative to the mean energy of stellar lyc ( see table  3 ) .",
    "we have assumed wavelength independent @xmath46 ( or lyc opacity through the ism ) to obtain our main results .",
    "this should be suitable for a clumpy ism ( see schematic figure  1 and discussion in  2.2.1 ) .",
    "we have also calculated a wavelength dependent case which corresponds to a homogeneous ism , and have found that the wavelength dependent case predicts a weaker lyman limit bump ( see figure  9 ) .",
    "in addition , we have compared the case with the photo - ionization code cloudy @xcite , and have found a good agreement ( see figure  9 ) .",
    "moreover , we have omitted helium , but it is justified by a discussion in  4.2 and by a comparison with cloudy ( see figure  9 ) .    the most interesting implication from our results would be the prediction of lyman `` bump '' galaxies ( see figure  4 and  4.3 ) ; galaxies containing very young ( @xmath0 myr ) , very massive ( @xmath1 @xmath2 ) , and extremely metal - poor ( or metal - free ) stellar populations show a prominent bump just below the lyman limit .",
    "this would be a new indicator to find such exotic stellar populations .",
    "although igm attenuation hampers us to use this method for @xmath52 galaxies , we can use it for @xmath3 galaxies .",
    "finally , we have discussed effects on the reionization briefly (  4.4 ) .",
    "escaping nebular lyc has two effects : acting as an additional lyc source and reducing the mean energy of escaping lyc photons .",
    "the first effect increases the escape fraction effectively , but the enhancement is at most a factor of 1.6 ( for @xmath21 k ) and the lyc photon escape rate never exceeds the production rate by stars ( see figure  8) .",
    "the second effect decreases the mean free path of lyc photons in the igm .",
    "however , the reduction of the mean photon energy is at most 1020% relative to the stellar lyc ( see table  3 ) .",
    "therefore , the nebular effect on the reionization may be small .",
    "the author appreciates discussions with h.  yajima which inspired the idea of nebular emissions .",
    "the author would like to thank d.  schaerer for providing his spectral models through i.  iwata , and c.  leitherer and g.  ferland for offering their codes to public .",
