    "after the discovery of a sm higgs boson  @xcite at the lhc  @xcite and preliminary measurements of its properties and couplings  @xcite which indicate close resemblance to the sm hypothesis , hints for physics beyond the sm remain elusive .",
    "a puzzle that remains in the context of sm irrespective of a seemingly unnatural electroweak scale is the mass hierarchy in the fermion sector and the large mass of the top quark rather close to the higgs vacuum expectation value .",
    "the restoration of chiral symmetry for vanishing yukawa interactions guarantees that corrections to elementary fermion masses are proportional to the fermion mass themselves in the sm . using the language of effective field theory , the yukawa couplings are marginal operators , _",
    "i.e. _ once their values are fixed by some uv dynamics  @xcite , they remain small at low energy scales .",
    "hence , the large hierarchy among the yukawa couplings largely determined by the top quark is typically considered a potential source of physics beyond the sm .",
    "indeed , the top typically plays a central role in most models that try to explain the electroweak scale at a more fundamental level .",
    "supersymmetric constructions  @xcite , fixed - point gravity scenarios  @xcite , and strong interactions  @xcite are just three well - known and well - established examples . in the latter case",
    ", the large mass of the top can be understood as a ( linear ) mixing effect of light elementary states with composite fermions of a strongly interacting sector  @xcite that also provides a set of nambu goldstone bosons forming the higgs doublet .",
    "the mixing effects together with fermion and gauge boson loops induce a coleman - weinberg higgs potential that triggers breaking of electroweak symmetry at a scale much smaller than the strong interaction scale . in such pseudo - nambu goldstone higgs scenarios",
    ", we can have a large resemblance of the higgs phenomenology with the sm , whilst the composite effects are hidden in the fermionic sector .",
    "phenomenological searches that target the potential substructure of the top quark are therefore also extremely important in the context of higgs physics , since both phenomena , the @xmath1(100 gev ) electroweak scale with the top quark in the same ball park , might point us towards a solution in terms of strong interactions .        of course , the phenomenological implications of compositeness are not new to particle and , more broadly speaking , to nuclear physics ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "the deviation from the anticipated rutherford scattering cross section at large angles observed by geiger and marsden  @xcite and the later resolution of atomic nuclei  @xcite is a well - known example of such a programme resolving point - like sources by probing the characteristic energy scale with high enough momentum transfers .",
    "the non - linear structure of qcd and the mismatch of the theory s fundamental degrees of freedom with the experimental observables , however , introduces another layer of complexity when we deal with non - standard interactions of a colour - charged object .",
    "we usually parametrize the deviations from the sm via introducing higher dimensional operators in an effective field theory description that is guided by the low - energy gauge symmetry requirements .",
    "since we can expect a separation between the new physics and the electroweak scale , it is customary to limit analyses to dimension six operator extensions to the sm  .",
    "however , since we can not separate different partonic initial and final states and due to the gauge structure , all operators that introduce non - standard qcd properties will contribute simultaneously .",
    "their different kinematical dependencies can be used to disentangle them  @xcite , but modifications due to new interactions will also change the response of the measurement strategy .",
    "the top quark production cross section will receive modifications for energetic events if new physics in the top sector is present .",
    "this immediately motivates boosted top searches  @xcite as a sensitive probe of modified qcd interactions on which we focus our analysis in the following . from previous analyses  @xcite",
    "it is expected that upon correlating inclusive and boosted measurements of @xmath2 we will be able to tightly constrain such non - standard interactions .",
    "however , there is a caveat : top quarks when produced at high @xmath0 are very likely to emit hard gluons before they decay  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that such an interaction has a decreased sensitivity to anomalous qcd top interactions .",
    "it is therefore crucial to include the anomalous top interactions to the proper modelling of the exclusive final state to correctly evaluate the prospects of the described measurement . by analyzing the fully hadronized final state in such a setup ,",
    "we are also guaranteed to correctly reflect the different selection efficiencies for the boosted subject analysis that emerge from the bsm - induced modifications of the top spectrum .",
    "more precisely : we investigate the constraints that we can expect from adapted searches for anomalous top interactions in the busy qcd - dominated lhc environment using realistic simulation , analysis and limit setting techniques .",
    "especially experimental systematics are known to be large in the tails of top distributions where the deviations from the sm will be most pronounced . unless these uncertainties are properly included in the formulation of the bsm limits we can not trust the analysis .",
    "we discuss the present systematics and include them to our cls  @xcite projection for the 14 tev lhc run in the most conservative way . to keep our analysis transparent we focus on two representative anomalous top - qcd operators that are characteristic for composite fermionic structures from a qcd point of view , namely colour charge radius and anomalous magnetic moment  @xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for similar work on composite leptons ) .",
    "the generalisation to other non - standard top - related interactions is straightforward .",
    "to get a quantitative estimate of the leading effects of non - standard top interactions at the lhc we focus on new physics contributions to @xmath3 production arising from modified qcd interactions .",
    "non - standard electroweak properties do impact the top decay @xmath4  @xcite , but can be studied separately in single top - production and interlaced with our findings .",
    "since the current lhc searches imply strong bounds on the masses of potential new degrees of freedom , it is expected to have a mass gap between the sm and the bsm fields ( which , _",
    "e.g. _ , lift the top mass via mixing effects  @xcite ) .",
    "+        in this case , the new physics effects can be parametrized via higher dimension operators involving only the sm particles and there is a number of new contact operators which impact @xmath5+jets production  @xcite .",
    "here we focus on some operators that allow an interpretation in terms of composite structures such as radii and anomalous magnetic dipole moments as a proof of principle .",
    "these non - standard properties can be introduced in a gauge - covariant way through the following effective dimension six interaction terms  @xcite    [ eq : lagrangian ] @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the gluon field , @xmath8 its field strength and @xmath9 the covariant derivative .",

    "( [ eq : lagrangian ] ) follows ref .",
    "@xcite ; the top quark radius @xmath10 and the anomalous chromomagnetic and chromoelectric dipole @xmath11 moments are related to the new physics scale @xmath12 in the `` traditional '' dimension six extension approach by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a @xmath15 parameter .    to have a consistent treatment of the dimension six operator expansion the new physics contributions are manifest only through the interference of these new physics operators contribution with the sm amplitude , _",
    "i.e. _ we do not include terms to the hadronic cross section other than the ones that formally scale as @xmath16 . splitting the amplitude that results from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : lagrangian ] ) into a sm and bsm piece @xmath17 we have for the ( partonic ) cross section @xmath18    the expansion of the cross section to @xmath16 removes the chromoelectric operator from the @xmath5 sample  @xcite and the sensitivity to @xmath19 arises from the less dominant @xmath20 contribution .",
    "the squared bsm matrix elements has a dependence on @xmath19  @xcite . at @xmath21 , however , when @xmath19 becomes resolvable , we can also expect additional dimension eight operators to enter the stage via interference with the sm amplitude . in such a case",
    "it is not clear how to interpret a limit obtained on @xmath19 .",
    "expanding of the cross section to @xmath16 will therefore only yield mild constraints on @xmath19 .    the deviations @xmath22 from the sm born - level partonic @xmath23 cross sections @xmath24 sketched in eq .",

    "notice that for @xmath28 initial states both new physics contributions @xmath10 and @xmath29 are present , whereas for @xmath30-induced production ( the main production mode for inclusive @xmath3 production at the lhc ) there is only sensitivity to the anomalous chromomagnetic moment @xmath29 .",
    "this is due gauge invariance of the dimension six operator , _",
    "i.e. _ , there is a ward identity that guarantees the cancellation of the @xmath10 dependence which do not vanish in dimensional regularization . ] in the sum of fig .",
    "[ fig : feyn ] .",
    "it can be shown that for the @xmath31 sample the same conclusion holds , _",
    "i.e. _ , the @xmath30 sub - channel still has no dependence on the @xmath10 parameter which originates from the @xmath28 and @xmath32 induced subprocesses  @xcite .",
    "we can enhance the fraction of the @xmath28 initial state and still probe @xmath10 at the lhc by requiring boosted top events .",
    "this is because energetic events probe the incoming partons at high momentum fractions where the proton s valence quarks parton densities peak .",
    "we illustrate this in fig .",
    "[ fig : tt_subchannels ] , where we present the fractional contribution of each partonic subprocess to the hadronic sm @xmath33 cross section as a function of the reconstructed @xmath3 mass and the top transverse momentum @xmath34 .",
    "we can invoke cuts on either observable to suppress the @xmath30 initial state although @xmath34 is more effective and the more crucial observable in the context of top tagging  @xcite .",
    "in our analysis we focus @xmath3 production with one top decaying semi - leptonically and the other hadronically .",
    "as this process involves the production of heavy coloured particles and we are selecting the boosted kinematical regime , we can expect an important contribution from initial and final - state jet radiation  @xcite . to take this sufficiently into account",
    "we include the bsm - mediated hard radiation effects via jet merging , keeping the full bsm dependence on the non - standard parameters of the respective samples to @xmath35 .",
    "as already mentioned , the dependencies on the top radius arise entirely from the @xmath28 and @xmath36 initial states . therefore , to constrain this operator",
    "it is necessary to suppress the dominant sub - channel at the lhc , namely the @xmath30 initial state .",
    "the boosted high @xmath0 selection serves two purposes in this sense : it removes the less sensitive initial states and focuses on regions where deviations from the sm are large , eq .",
    "( [ eq : cross_sec ] ) ..    our implementation starts by including the new interactions presented in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : lagrangian ] ) through feynrules  @xcite , which outputs a ufo model file  @xcite that is further used into madgraph5  @xcite .",
    "madgraph performs the event generation that is subsequently showered with pythia6  @xcite where we take into account the initial and final state radiation , hadronization and underlying event .",
    "the hard matrix elements have been adapted to only include the interference of the new physics amplitude with the sm counterpart ; this way we guarantee a consistent expansion of the cross section up to @xmath35 as discussed earlier when qcd emission is hard and sensitive to the bsm effects .",
    "we have validated our parton level matrix element implementation against existing analytic calculations as well as an independent monte carlo implementation  @xcite .",
    "the jet merging is subsequently performed by employing the mlm scheme  @xcite as implemented in the madgraph package . throughout the analysis we consider the lhc running at @xmath37 and the sm @xmath3 cross section normalization is re - scaled to the nnlo value , @xmath38  pb  @xcite .",
    "we find that for our boosted selection that the background is completely dominated by sm @xmath5 production .",
    "all other background contributions are negligible and well below the sm @xmath5 uncertainty .",
    "we include the expected dominant nlo shape modifications via  @xcite : we construct a re - weighting function with respect to the @xmath39 sample ( the sm ) to account for differential qcd corrections in the bsm histograms .",
    "this is a necessary procedure to have a well - defined limit @xmath40 . throughout , we choose the renormalization and factorization scales as the transverse mass since this choices yield a rather flat scale dependence of the nlo matched @xmath5 cross section , fig .",
    "[ fig : scales ] .",
    "instead of proceeding as in a `` traditional '' semi - leptonic @xmath3 analysis we take advantage of the efficient top tagging for high @xmath0 fat jets .",
    "this is facilitated by defining a fat jet with a large cone size @xmath41 using the cambridge / aachen algorithm as implemented in fastjet  @xcite .",
    "we require at least one of these objects to have a transverse momentum larger than @xmath42 .",
    "we choose this exemplary value due to a large top tagging efficiency @xmath43 and small fake rate @xmath44 . for this threshold",
    "the @xmath5 cross section is also still large enough @xmath45 to perform measurements with small statistical uncertainties ; the eventual value of @xmath46 by the experiments will optimise the systematic uncertainty .",
    "this fat jet is then further processed by the heptoptagger  @xcite .",
    "initially the heptoptagger was designed to reconstruct only mildly boosted top quarks ( @xmath47 ) using a very large fat jet cone size . however , in searches for heavy resonances  @xcite it was shown that due to its flexible reconstruction algorithm and jet grooming procedures the heptoptagger is an effective tool to reconstruct highly boosted top quarks while maintaining a small background fake rate .",
    "other top taggers , designed to tag highly - boosted top quarks , can be similarly effective @xcite .",
    "top tagging is sensitive to the top s @xmath0 bsm spectrum modification and modified hard shower profile that results from including @xmath48 at @xmath35 precision .",
    "hence , the top tag efficiency itself is a function of the anomalous parameters .    after a successful tag",
    ", the corresponding jet is removed from the event and we proceed by re - clustering the remaining hadronic activity as usual , _",
    "i.e. _ by applying the cambridge / aachen algorithm with @xmath49 .",

    "we also require an isolated lepton in the final state with @xmath52 and @xmath53 where the lepton is defined isolated if the transverse energy deposit @xmath54 inside a cone around the lepton of size @xmath55 is less than 20% of its transverse energy @xmath56 .",
    "on the one hand , the small theoretical uncertainties on the @xmath3 invariant mass motivates this observable as a suitable choice to examine our bsm hypotheses  @xcite . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : cross_sec ] ) it becomes clear that dominant bsm corrections are directly reflected in the @xmath57 distributions ( it is also the variable which typically enters as the only kinematical parameter in total cross section and re - summation calculations , see  @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",

    "[ fig : lag1cls].,scaledwidth=43.0% ]    missing energy of the final state from the leptonic top decay is not a drawback : the final state neutrino momentum can be reconstructed by requiring transverse momentum conservation and by imposing that the invariant mass @xmath65neutrino is equal to @xmath66 .",
    "these conditions define respectively the neutrino transverse and longitudinal momentum components .",
    "to suppress the combinatorics in the @xmath3 mass reconstruction we need to identify which jet is the most likely to be the @xmath67-jet , despite of not using @xmath67-tagging in this analysis .",
    "this can be efficiently done by identifying the @xmath67-jet as the closest jet to the lepton with an invariant bottom - lepton mass that satisfies the top decay kinematics  @xcite @xmath68    after these steps we end up with distributions as depicted in fig .",

    "there is a caveat .",
    "the uncertainties , especially in the @xmath72 tails of the distributions can be large , and are currently driven by experimental systematics  @xcite rather than theoretical limitations ( for a recent high precision calculation see  @xcite ) . to get a feeling of the size of the systematics we include the relative systematic uncertainty from  @xcite for @xmath73  tev to fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] ; the theoretical uncertainty of  @xcite is negligible compared to the systematics of  @xcite .",

    "it becomes immediately clear that the shape uncertainty will be the limiting factor of this analysis , especially if we want push limits @xmath40 .",
    "the standard way of including such an uncertainty is via nuisance parameters of the null hypothesis ( sm @xmath59 production in our case )  @xcite .",
    "when computing the confidence level , these nuisance parameters are marginalized or profiled .",
    "however , it can happen that the process of marginalization can stealth the systematic uncertainty entirely .",
    "e.g. _ , including a shape uncertainty to only the null hypothesis and not to the alternative hypothesis , marginalization will shift the median of the toy - sampled log - likelihood distribution for the null hypothesis away from the alternative hypothesis median .",

    "indeed , for smaller individual values @xmath78 we can not formulate constraints as the bsm distribution is entirely covered by the sm uncertainty band .",
    "we therefore conclude that an improvement beyond the shown parameter choices depends crucially on the reduction of the experimental systematics ( which should be well - possible when larger data samples are available ) .",

    "<S> the top quark , being the heaviest particle of the standard model , is a prime candidate of where physics beyond the sm might currently hide before our eyes . </S>",
    "<S> there are many natural extensions of the sm that rely on top compositeness , and the top quark could follow the paradigm of revealing a substructure when it is probed at high enough momentum transfers . </S>",
    "<S> observing high @xmath0 top final states naturally drives us towards boosted hadronic analyses that can be tackled efficiently with jet substructure techniques . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we analyse the prospects of constraining exemplary non - standard qcd top interactions in this kinematical regime . </S>",
    "<S> we correctly include qcd modifications to additional gluon emission off the boosted top quark and keep track of the modified top tagging efficiencies . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that non - standard top qcd interactions can be formidably constrained at the lhc 14 tev . </S>",
    "<S> experimental systematic uncertainties are a major obstacle of the described measurement . </S>",
