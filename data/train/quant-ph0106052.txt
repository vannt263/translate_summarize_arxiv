    "the formula for the capacity of a classical channel was derived in 1948 by shannon .",
    "it has long been known that this formula is not directly applicable to channels with significant quantum effects . extending this theorem to take quantum effects into account",
    "has been harder than might have been anticipated ; despite much recent effort , we do not yet have a comprehensive theory for the capacity of quantum channels .",
    "the book of nielsen and chuang @xcite and the survey paper @xcite are two sources giving good overviews of quantum information theory . in this paper",
    ", we advance quantum information theory by proving a capacity formula for quantum channels which holds when the sender and receiver have access to shared quantum entangled states which can be used in the communication protocol .",
    "we also present a conjecture that would imply that , in the presence of shared entanglement , to first order this entanglement - assisted capacity is the only quantity determining the asymptotic behavior of a quantum channel .",
    "a ( memoryless ) quantum communications channel can be viewed physically as a process wherein a quantum system interacts with an environment ( which may be taken to initially be in a standard state ) on its way from a sender to a receiver ; it may be defined mathematically as a completely positive , trace - preserving linear map on density operators .",
    "the theory of quantum channels is richer and less well understood than that of classical channels .",
    "for example , quantum channels have several distinct capacities , depending on what one is trying to use them for , and what additional resources are brought into play .",
    "these include    * the ordinary classical capacity @xmath2 , defined as the maximum asymptotic rate at which classical bits can be transmitted reliably through the channel , with the help of a quantum encoder and decoder .",
    "* the ordinary quantum capacity @xmath3 , which is the maximum asymptotic rate at which qubits can be transmitted under similar circumstances . * the classically assisted quantum capacity @xmath4 , which is the maximum asymptotic rate of reliable qubit transmission with the help of unlimited use of a 2-way classical side channel between sender and receiver .",
    "* the entanglement assisted classical capacity @xmath0 , which is the maximum asymptotic rate of reliable bit transmission with the help of unlimited prior entanglement between the sender and receiver .",
    "somewhat unexpectedly , the last of these has turned out to be the simplest to calculate , because , as we show in section ii , it is given by an expression analogous to the formula expressing the classical capacity of a classical channel as the maximum , over input distributions , of the input : output mutual information .",
    "section iii calculates entanglement assisted capacities of the amplitude damping channel and of amplifying and attenuating bosonic channels with gaussian noise .",
    "we return now to a general discussion of quantum channels and capacities , in order to provide motivation for section iv of the paper , on what we call the reverse shannon theorem .    aside from the constraints @xmath5 , and @xmath6 , which are obvious consequences of the definitions , the four capacities appear to vary rather independently .",
    "it is conjectured that @xmath7 , but this has not been proved to date .",
    "except in special cases , it is not possible , without knowing the parameters of a channel , to infer any one of its four capacities from the other three .",
    "this independence is illustrated in table  [ chan - table ] , which compares the capacities of several simple channels for which they are known exactly .",
    "the channels incidentally illustrate four different degrees of qualitative quantumness : the first can carry qubits unassisted , the second requires classical assistance to do so , the third has no quantum capacity at all but still exhibits quantum behavior in that its capacity is increased by entanglement , while the fourth is completely classical , and so unaffected by entanglement .",
    "[ chan - table ]    .capacities of several quantum channels . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     contrary to an earlier conjecture of ours , we have found channels for which @xmath8 but @xmath9 .",
    "one example is a channel mapping three qubits to two qubits which is switched between two different behaviors by the first input qubit .",
    "the channel operates as follows : the first qubit is measured in the @xmath10 basis .",
    "if the result is @xmath11 , then the other two qubits are dephased ( i.e. , measured in the @xmath11 , @xmath12 basis ) and transmitted as classical bits ; if the result is @xmath12 , the first qubit is transmitted intact and the second qubit is replaced by the completely mixed state .",
    "this channel has @xmath13 ( achieved by setting the first qubit to @xmath12 ) and @xmath14 .",
    "this complex situation naturally raises the question of how many independent parameters are needed to characterize the important asymptotic , capacity - like properties of a general quantum channel . a full understanding of quantum channels would enable us to calculate not only their capacities , but",
    "more generally , for any two channels @xmath15 and @xmath16 , the asymptotic efficiency ( possibly zero ) with which @xmath17 can simulate @xmath16 , both alone and in the presence of ancillary resources such as classical communication or shared entanglement .",
    "one motivation for studying communication in the presence of ancillary resources is that it can simplify the classification of channels capacities to simulate one another .",
    "this is so because if a simulation is possible without the ancillary resource , then the simulation remains possible with it , though not necessarily vice versa .",
    "for example , @xmath3 and @xmath2 represent a channel s asymptotic efficiencies of simulating , respectively , a noiseless qubit channel and a noiseless classical bit channel . in the absence of ancillary resources",
    "these two capacities can vary independently , subject to the constraint @xmath18 , but in the presence of unlimited prior shared entanglement , the relation between them becomes fixed : @xmath19 , because shared entanglement allows a noiseless 2-bit classical channel to simulate a noiseless 1-qubit channel and vice versa ( via teleportation @xcite and superdense coding @xcite ) .",
    "we conjecture that prior entanglement so simplifies the complex landscape of quantum channels that only a single free parameter remains .",
    "specifically , we conjecture that in the presence of unlimited prior entanglement , any two quantum channels of equal @xmath0 could simulate one another with unit asymptotic efficiency .",
    "section iv proves a classical analog of this conjecture , namely that in the presence of prior random information shared between sender and receiver , any two discrete memoryless classical channels ( dmc s ) of equal capacity can simulate one another with unit asymptotic efficiency .",
    "we call this the classical reverse shannon theorem because it establishes the ability of a noiseless classical dmc to simulate noisy ones of equal capacity , whereas the ordinary shannon theorem establishes that noisy dmc s can simulate noiseless ones of equal capacity .    another ancillary resource  classical communication  also simplifies the landscape of quantum channels , but probably not so much . the presence of unlimited classical communication does allow certain otherwise inequivalent pairs of channels to simulate one another ( for example , a noiseless qubit channel and a 50% erasure channel on 4-dimensional hilbert space ) , but it does not render all channels of equal @xmath4 asymptotically equivalent .",
    "so - called bound - entangled channels  @xcite have @xmath20 , but unlike classical channels ( which also have @xmath20 ) they can be used to prepare bound entangled states , which are entangled but can not be used to prepare any pure entangled states . because the distinction between bound entangled and unentangled states does not vanish asymptotically , even in the presence of unlimited classical communication @xcite , bound - entangled and classical channels must be asymptotically inequivalent , despite having the same @xmath4 .",
    "the various capacities of a quantum channel @xmath16 may be defined within a common framework , c_x(n)=_0_n \\ { : _ a_b _ _ m f(,a , b , n)>1-}. [ framework ] here @xmath21 is a generalized capacity ; @xmath22 is an encoding subprotocol , to be performed by alice , which receives an @xmath23-qubit state @xmath24 belonging to some set @xmath25 of allowable inputs to the entire protocol , and produces @xmath26 possibly entangled inputs to the channel @xmath16 ; @xmath27 is a decoding subprotocol , to be performed by bob , which receives @xmath26 ( possibly entangled ) channel outputs and produces an @xmath23-qubit output for the entire protocol ; finally @xmath28 is the _ fidelity _ of this output relative to the input @xmath24 , i.e. , the probability that the output state would pass a test determining whether it is equal to the input ( more generally , the fidelity of one mixed state @xmath1 relative to another @xmath29 is @xmath30 ) .",
    "different capacities are defined depending on the specification of @xmath31 , @xmath22 and @xmath27 .",
    "the classical capacities @xmath2 and @xmath0 are defined by restricting @xmath24 to a standard orthonormal set of states , without loss of generality the `` boolean '' states labelled by bit strings @xmath32 ; for the quantum capacities @xmath3 and @xmath4 , @xmath25 is the entire @xmath33 dimensional hilbert space @xmath34 . for the simple capacities @xmath3 and @xmath2 , the alice and bob subprotocols are completely - positive trace - preserving maps from @xmath35 to the input space of @xmath36 , and from the output space of @xmath36 back to @xmath35 . for @xmath0 and @xmath4 ,",
    "the subprotocols are more complicated , in the first case drawing on a supply of ebits ( maximally entangled pairs of qubits ) shared beforehand between alice and bob , and in the latter case making use of a 2-way classical channel between alice and bob .",
    "the definition of @xmath4 thus includes interactive protocols , in which the @xmath26 channel uses do not take place all at once , but may be interspersed with rounds of classical communication .    the classical capacity of a classical discrete memoryless channel is also given by an expression of the same form , with @xmath24 restricted to boolean values ; the encoder @xmath22 , decoder @xmath27 , and channel @xmath16 all being restricted to be classical stochastic maps ; and the fidelity @xmath37 being defined as the probability that the ( boolean ) output of @xmath38 is equal to the input @xmath24 .",
    "we will sometimes indicate these restrictions implicitly by using upper case italic letters ( e.g.  @xmath39 ) for classical stochastic maps , and lower case italic letters ( e.g. @xmath40 ) for classical discrete data .",
    "the definition of classical capacity would then be c(n)=_0_n \\ { : _ a_b _",
    "x\\{0,1}^m f(x , a , b , n ) > 1-}. a classical stochastic map , or classical channel , may be defined in quantum terms as one that is completely dephasing in the boolean basis both with regard to its inputs and its outputs .",
    "a channel , in other words , is classical if and only if it can be represented as a composition n = dgd [ classchan]of the completely dephasing channel @xmath41 on the input hilbert space , followed by a general quantum channel @xmath42 , followed by the completely dephasing channel @xmath43 on the output hilbert space ( a completely dephasing channel is one that makes a von neumann measurement in the boolean basis and resends the result of the measurement ) . dephasing only the inputs , or only the outputs ,",
    "is in general insufficient to abolish all quantum properties of a quantum channel @xmath42 .",
    "the notion of capacity may be further generalized to define a capacity of one channel @xmath16 to simulate another channel @xmath17 .",
    "this may be defined as    c_x(n , m ) = _ 0 _ n \\ { : _ a , b _",
    "f(m^m(),a , b , n)>1- } , [ mnsim]where @xmath22 and @xmath27 are respectively alice s and bob s subprotocols which together enable alice to receive an input @xmath24 in @xmath44 ( the tensor product of @xmath23 copies of the input hilbert space @xmath45 of the channel @xmath17 to be simulated ) and , making @xmath26 forward uses of the simulating channel @xmath16 , allow bob to produce some output state , and @xmath46 is the fidelity of this output state with respect to the state that would have been generated by sending the input @xmath24 through @xmath47",
    ".    these definitions of capacity are all asymptotic , depending on the properties of @xmath36 in the limit @xmath48 .",
    "however , several of the capacities are given by , or closely related to , non - asymptotic expressions involving input and output entropies for a single use of the channel .",
    "figure 1 shows a scenario in which a quantum system @xmath3 , initially in mixed state @xmath1 , is sent through the channel , emerging in a mixed state @xmath49 .",
    "it is useful to think of the initial mixed state as being part of an entangled pure state @xmath50 where @xmath51 is some reference system that is never operated upon physically .",
    "similarly the channel can be thought of as a unitary interaction @xmath52 between the quantum system @xmath3 and some environment subsystem @xmath53 , which is initially supplied in a standard pure state @xmath54 , and leaves the interaction in a mixed state @xmath55 .",
    "thus @xmath16 and @xmath56 are completely positive maps relating the final states of the channel output and environment , respectively , to the initial state of the channel input , when the initial state of the environment is held fixed .",
    "the mnemonic superscripts @xmath57 indicate , when necessary , to what system a density operator refers .    under these circumstances",
    "three useful von neumann entropies may be defined , the input entropy @xmath58 the output entropy @xmath59 and the _ entropy exchange _",
    "@xmath60    the complicated left side of the last equation represents the entropy of the joint state of the subsystem @xmath3 which has been through the channel , and the reference system @xmath51 , which has not , but may still be more or less entangled with it .",
    "the density operator @xmath61 is the quantum analog of a joint input : output probability distribution , because it has @xmath62 and @xmath1 as its partial traces . without the reference system , the notion of a joint input : output mixed state would be problematic , because the input and output are not present at the same time , and the no - cloning theorem prevents alice from retaining a spare copy of the input to be compared with the one sent through the channel .",
    "the entropy exchange is also equal to the final entropy of the environment @xmath63 , because the tripartite system @xmath64 remains throughout in a pure state ; making its two complementary subsystems @xmath53 and @xmath65 always isospectral .",
    "the relations between these entropies and quantum channels have been well reviewed by schumacher and nielsen  @xcite and by holevo and werner  @xcite .    by shannon",
    "s theorem , the capacity of a classical channel @xmath39 is the maximum , over input distributions , of the input : output mutual information , in other words the input entropy plus the output entropy less the joint entropy of input and output . the quantum generalization of mutual information for a bipartite mixed state @xmath66 , which reduces to classical mutual information when @xmath66 is diagonal in a product basis of the two subsystems , is @xmath67 where @xmath68 in terms of figure [ bigcef1 ] , the classical capacity of a classical channel ( cf .",
    "( [ classchan ] ) ) can be expressed as c(n ) = _ h ( ) + h(n ( ) ) - h((n ) ( _ ) ) where @xmath69 is the class of density operators on the channel s input hilbert space that are diagonal in the boolean basis .",
    "the third term ( entropy exchange ) , for a classical channel @xmath39 , is just the joint shannon entropy of the classically correlated boolean input and output , because the von neumann entropies reduce to shannon entropies when evaluated in the schmidt basis of @xmath70 , with respect to which all states are diagonal .",
    "the restriction to classical inputs @xmath71 can be removed , because any non - diagonal elements in @xmath1 would only reduce the first term , while leaving the other two terms unchanged , by virtue of the diagonality - enforcing properties of the channel .",
    "thus , the expression @xmath72 is a natural generalization to quantum channels @xmath16 of a classical channel s maximal input : output mutual information , and it is equal to the classical capacity whenever @xmath16 is classical , as defined previously in this section",
    ".    one might hope that this expression continues to give the classical capacity of a general quantum channel @xmath16 , but that is not so , as can be seen by considering the simple case @xmath73 of a noiseless qubit channel . here",
    "the maximum is attained on a uniform input mixed state @xmath74 , causing the first two terms each to have the value 1 bit , while the last term is zero , giving a total of 2 bits .",
    "this is not the ordinary classical capacity of the noiseless qubit channel , which is equal to 1 bit , but rather its entanglement - assisted capacity @xmath75 .",
    "in the next section we show that this is true of quantum channels in general , as stated by the following theorem .",
    "given a quantum channel @xmath16 , then the entanglement - assisted capacity of the quantum channel @xmath0 is equal to the maximal quantum mutual information @xmath76    here the capacity @xmath0 is defined as the supremum of eq .",

    "we will be using this theorem extensively in the proof of our entanglement - assisted capacity bound .    in our original paper @xcite",
    ", we proved the formula ( [ ce - capacity ] ) for certain special cases , including the depolarizing channel and the erasure channel .",
    "we did this by sandwiching the entanglement - assisted capacity between two other capacities , which for certain channels turned out to be equal .",
    "the higher of these two capacities we called the forward classical communication cost via teleportation , ( @xmath85 ) , which is the amount of forward classical communication needed to simulate the channel @xmath16 by teleporting over a noisy classical channel .",
    "the lower of these two bounds we called @xmath86 , which is the capacity obtained by using the noisy quantum channel @xmath16 in the superdense coding protocol .",
    "we have that @xmath87 .",
    "thus , if @xmath88 for a channel , we have obtained the entanglement - assisted capacity of the channel . in order for this argument to work , we needed the classical reverse shannon theorem , which says that a noisy classical channel can be simulated by a noiseless classical channel of the same capacity , as long as the sender and receiver have access to shared random bits .",
    "we needed this theorem because the causality argument showing that epr pairs do not add to the capacity of a classical channel appears to work only for noiseless channels .",
    "we sketched the proof of the classical reverse shannon theorem in our previous paper , and give it in full in this paper .    in our previous paper ,",
    "the bounds @xmath86 and @xmath85 are both computed using single - symbol protocols ; that is , both the superdense coding protocol and the simulation of the channel by teleportation via a noisy classical channel are carried out with a single use of the channel . the capacity is then obtained using the classical shannon formula for a classical channel associated with these protocols . in this paper , we obtain bounds using multiple - symbol protocols , which perform entangled operations on many uses of the channel .",
    "we then perform the capacity computations using the holevo - schumacher - westmoreland formula ( [ holevo ] ) .",
    "assume we have a quantum channel @xmath16 which maps a hilbert space @xmath89 to another hilbert space @xmath90 .",
    "let @xmath0 be the classical capacity of the channel when the sender and receiver have an unbounded supply of epr pairs to use in the communication protocol .",
    "this section proves that the entanglement - assisted capacity of a channel is the maximum quantum mutual information attainable between the two parts of an entangled quantum state , one part of which has been passed through the channel .",
    "that is , @xmath91 where @xmath92 denotes the von neumann entropy of a density matrix @xmath93 , @xmath94 denotes the von neumann entropy of the output when @xmath1 is input into the channel , and @xmath95 denotes the von neumann entropy of a purification @xmath70 of @xmath1 over a reference system @xmath96 , half of which ( @xmath97 ) has been sent through the channel @xmath16 while the other half ( @xmath96 ) has been sent through the identity channel @xmath98 ( this corresponds to the portion of the entangled state that bob holds at the start of the protocol ) . here , we have @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "all purifications of @xmath1 give the same entropy in this formula , so we need not specify which one we use .",
    "as pointed out earlier , the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ ce ] ) parallels the expression for capacity of a classical channel as the maximum , over input distributions , of the input : output mutual information .    lindblad  @xcite , barnum et al .",
    "@xcite , and adami and cerf  @xcite characterized several important properties of the quantum mutual information , including positivity , additivity and the data processing inequality .",
    "adami and cerf argued that the right side of eq .",
    "( [ ce ] ) represents an important channel property , calling it the channel s `` von neumann capacity '' , but they did not indicate what kind of communication task this capacity represented the channel s asymptotic efficiency for doing .",
    "now we know that it is the channel s efficiency for transmitting classical information when the sender and receiver share prior entanglement .    in our demonstration that eq .",
    "( [ ce ] ) is indeed the correct expression for entanglement assisted classical capacity , the first subsection gives an entanglement assisted classical communication protocol which can asymptotically achieve the rate @xmath101 for any @xmath102 .",

    "the third subsection shows that the right hand side of eq .",

    "the fourth subsection proves several entropy inequalities that are used in the third subsection .      in this section",
    ", we will prove the inequality c_e(n ) _ _ in   h ( ) + h(n ( ) ) - h(n ( _ ) ) .",
    "[ lower - bound ] we first show the inequality c_e(n ) h ( ) + h(n ( ) ) - h(n ( _ ) ) [ nomax ] for the special case where @xmath104 , where @xmath105 , @xmath106 is the identity matrix , and @xmath70 is a maximally entangled state .",
    "we then use this special case to show that the inequality ( [ nomax ] ) still holds when @xmath1 is any projection matrix .",
    "we finally use the case where @xmath1 is a projection matrix to prove the inequality in the general case of arbitrary @xmath1 , showing ( [ lower - bound ] ) ; we do this by taking @xmath107 to be the projection onto the typical subspace of @xmath108 , and using @xmath107 and @xmath36 in the inequality ( [ nomax ] ) .",
    "the coding protocol we use for the special case given above , where @xmath109 , is essentially the same as the protocol used for quantum superdense coding @xcite , which procedure yields the entanglement - assisted capacity in the case of a noiseless quantum channel .",
    "the proof that the formula ( [ nomax ] ) holds for @xmath110 , however , is quite different from and somewhat more complicated than the proof that superdense coding works .",
    "our proof uses holevo s formula ( [ holevo ] ) for quantum capacity to compute the capacity achieved by our protocol .",
    "this protocol is the same as that given in our earlier paper on @xmath0 @xcite , although our proof is different ; the earlier proof only applied to certain quantum channels , such as those that commute with teleportation .",

    "alice and bob start by sharing a @xmath111-dimensional maximally entangled state @xmath116 .",
    "alice applies one of the @xmath112 transformations @xmath117 to her part of @xmath116 , and then sends it through the channel @xmath16 .",

    "in fact , one can prove this case by using the above result . by restricting @xmath89 to the support of @xmath1 , which we can denote by @xmath123 , and by restricting @xmath16 to act only on @xmath123",

    "we now must show that ( [ nomax ] ) holds for arbitrary @xmath1 .",
    "this is the most difficult part of the proof . for this step",

    "we introduce @xmath56 , which is the completely positive map taking @xmath89 to @xmath127 by first applying @xmath126 and tracing out everything but @xmath127 .",

    "we use frequency - typical subspaces . for any @xmath102 and @xmath128",

    "it follows from well - known facts about typical subspaces that @xmath138 we can also show the following lemma .",
    "we delay giving the proof of this lemma until after the proof of the theorem .",
    "[ typical - lemma ] let @xmath16 be a noisy quantum channel and @xmath1 a density matrix on the input space of this channel .",
    "then we can find a sequence of frequency typical subspaces @xmath137 corresponding to @xmath108 , such that if @xmath136 is the unit trace density matrix proportional to the projection onto @xmath137 , then _",
    "n h(n^n(_t_n ) ) = h(n ( ) ) .    applying the lemma to the map onto the environment similarly gives _",
    "n h(e^n(_t_n ) ) = h(e ( ) ) .",
    "thus , if we consider the quantity we see that it converges to h ( ) + h(n ( ) ) - h(e ( ) ) , which the identity ( [ entropy - exchange ] ) shows is equal to the desired quantity ( [ ce ] ) .",
    "this concludes the proof of the lower bound .",
    "one more matter to be cleared up is the form of the prior entanglement to be shared by alice and bob .",
    "the most standard form of entanglement is maximally entangled pairs of qubits ( `` ebits '' ) , and it is natural to use them as the entanglement resource in defining @xmath0 .",
    "however , eq .  ( [ ce ] ) involves the entangled state @xmath70 , which is typically not a product of ebits .",
    "this is no problem , because , as lo and popescu  @xcite showed , many copies of two entangled pure states having an equal entropy of entanglement can be interconverted not only with unit asymptotic efficiency , but in a way that requires an asymptotically negligible amount of ( one - way ) classical communication , compared to the amount of entanglement processed .",
    "thus the definition of @xmath0 is independent of the form of the entanglement resource , so long as it is a pure state .",

    "[ we use @xmath461 , rather than @xmath102 , to keep the total overhead , including other costs , below @xmath102 ] .",
    "alice receives the @xmath26-bit input @xmath40 .",
    "alice simulates the true channel @xmath450 within her laboratory , obtaining an @xmath26-bit `` provisional output '' @xmath463 .",
    "although this @xmath463 is distributed with the correct probability for the channel output , she tries to avoid transmitting @xmath463 to bob , because doing so would require @xmath26 bits of forward communication , and she wishes to simulate the channel accurately while using less forward communication .",
    "instead , where possible , she substitutes a member of the preagreed set @xmath459 , as we shall now describe .",
    "alice computes the hamming distance , @xmath464 between @xmath40 and @xmath463 .",
    "alice determines whether there are any strings in the preagreed set @xmath459 having the same hamming distance @xmath111 from @xmath40 as @xmath463 does .",

    "if not , she sends bob the string @xmath468 , the original unmodified @xmath26-bit string @xmath463 , prefixed by a 1 . 6 .",
    "bob emits @xmath465 or @xmath463 , whichever he has received , as the final output of the simulation .",
    "it can readily be seen that the probability of failure in step 5i.e .",
    ", of there being no string of the correct hamming distance in the preagreed set @xmath459decreases exponentially with @xmath26 as long as @xmath301 .",
    "thus the probability of needing to use more than @xmath469 bits of forward communication approaches zero as required by eq .",
    "( [ bsc2 ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "regardless of whether step 5 succeeds or fails , the final output is correctly distributed ( satisfying eq .",
    "( [ bsc2 ] ) ) since it has the correct distribution of hamming distances from the input @xmath40 , and , for each hamming distance , is equidistributed among all strings at that hamming distance from @xmath40 .",
    "the theorem follows .    for a general discrete memoryless channel the protocol",
    "must be modified to take account of the nonbinary input and output alphabets , and the fact that the output entropy may be different for different inputs , unlike the bsc case .",
    "the notion of hamming distance also needs to be generalized .",
    "the new protocol uses the notion of _ type class_@xcite .",
    "two @xmath26-character strings belong to the same type class if they have equal letter frequencies ( for example four a s , three b s , twelve c s etc . ) , and are therefore equivalent under some permutation of letter positions .",
    "we will consider input type classes ( itcs ) and joint input / output type classes ( jtc ) , the latter being defined as a set of input / output pairs ( x , y ) equivalent under some common permutation of the input and output letter positions . in other words , @xmath470 and @xmath471 belong to the same jtc if and only if there exists a permutation of letter positions , @xmath472 , such that @xmath473 and @xmath474 .",
    "evidently , for any given input and output alphabet size , the number of itcs , and the number of jtc are each polynomial in @xmath26 .",
    "let @xmath475 index the itcs , and @xmath476 the jtc for inputs of length @xmath26 .",
    "the jtc will be our generalization of the hamming distance , since the transition probability @xmath477 is equal for all pairs @xmath478 in a given jtc .",
    "the new protocol follows :    1 .   before receiving the input @xmath479 , alice and bob use the common random information @xmath51 to preagree on @xmath480 random sets @xmath481 of @xmath26-letter output strings , one for each itc .",
    "the set @xmath482 has cardinality @xmath483 , where @xmath484 is the channel s capacity for inputs in the @xmath383th itc ( in other words , @xmath485 times the channel s input : output mutual information on @xmath26-letter inputs uniformly distributed over the @xmath383th itc ) .",
    "in contrast to the bsc case , where the members of @xmath459 were chosen randomly from a uniform distribution on the output space , the elements of @xmath482 are chosen randomly from the ( in general nonuniform ) output distribution induced by a uniform distribution of channel inputs over the @xmath383th itc .",
    "2 .   alice receives the @xmath26-letter input @xmath40 , determines which itc , @xmath383 , it belongs to , and sends @xmath383 to bob , using @xmath486 bits to do so .",
    "3 .   alice simulates the true channel @xmath450 in her laboratory , obtaining an @xmath26-letter provisional output string @xmath463 .",
    "although this @xmath463 is distributed with the correct probability for the channel input @xmath40 , she tries to avoid transmitting @xmath463 to bob , because to do so would require too much forward communication .",
    "instead she proceeds as described below .",
    "alice computes the index @xmath487 of the jtc to which the input / output pair @xmath478 belongs . as noted above",
    ", this jtc index is the generalization of the hamming distance , which we used in the bsc case .",
    "alice determines whether there are any output strings in the preagreed set @xmath482 having the same jtc index relative to @xmath40 as @xmath463 does .",
    "if so , she selects a random one of them , call it @xmath465 , and sends bob the string @xmath466 where @xmath79 is the approximately @xmath467-bit index of @xmath465 within the set @xmath482 .",
    "if not , she sends bob the string @xmath468 .",
    "bob emits @xmath465 or @xmath463 , whichever he has received , as the final output of the simulation .",
    "this protocol deals with the problem of dependence of output entropy on input by encoding each itc separately . within any one itc ,",
    "the output entropy is independent of the input .",
    "the communication cost of telling bob in which itc the input lies is polylogarithmic in @xmath26 , and so asymptotically negligible compared to @xmath26 .",
    "because one can not increase the capacity of a channel by restricting its input , @xmath488 is an upper bound the input : output mutual information @xmath489 for inputs restricted to a particular itc .",
    "moreover , for any itc @xmath383 and any input @xmath40 in that itc , the input : output pairs generated by the true channel @xmath490 , will be narrowly concentrated , for large @xmath26 , on jtc whose transition frequencies approximate ( to within @xmath491 their asymptotic values .",
    "therefore , as before , for any @xmath301 , the probability of failure in step 5 will decrease exponentially with @xmath26 . and",
    "as before , the simulated transition probability @xmath492 on each itc is exactly correct even for finite @xmath26 . the reverse shannon theorem for a general dmc follows , as does the following corollary .",
    "+ in the presence of shared random information between sender and receiver , any two classical channels of equal capacity can simulate one another , in the sense of eq .",
    "( [ mnsim ] ) , with unit asymptotic efficiency .    from the proof of the main theorem",
    "it can also be seen that when inputs to the noisy channel being simulated come from a source having a frequency distribution @xmath493 differing from the optimal one @xmath378 for which capacity @xmath2 is attained , then the asymptotic cost of simulating the channel on that source is correspondingly less .",
    "let @xmath39 be a dmc , @xmath493 be a probability distribution over the source alphabet , and @xmath494 be the channel s constrained capacity , equal to the single - letter input : output mutual information on source @xmath493 .",
    "then , in the presence of shared random information @xmath51 between sender and receiver , the action of @xmath39 on any extended source having @xmath493 for each of its marginal distributions can be simulated in the manner of theorem [ crst ] with perfect fidelity and a forward noiseless communication cost asymptotically approaching @xmath494 : viz . @xmath495 .",
    "here @xmath496 denotes the number of bits of forward communication used by the protocol when @xmath51 is chosen randomly with a uniform distribution and inputs are chosen randomly according to the constrained extended source .",
    "we conjecture ( qrsc ) that in the presence of unlimited shared entanglement between sender and receiver , all quantum channels of equal @xmath0 can simulate one another with unit asymptotic efficiency , in the sense of eq .",
    "( [ mnsim ] ) . by the results of the previous section , the conjecture holds for classical channels ( where the shared random information required for the classical reverse shannon theorem is obtained from shared entanglement ) . in our previous paper @xcite",
    "we showed that the qrsc also holds for another class of channels , the so - called bell - diagonal channels , which commute with teleportation and superdense coding .",
    "for these channels , the single - use entanglement - assisted classical capacity of the channel via superdense coding is equal to the forward classical communication cost of simulating it via teleportation .",
    "the qrsc asserts this equality holds asymptotically for all quantum channels , even when ( as for the amplitude damping channel ) it is does not hold for single uses of the channel .",
    "we hope that the arguments used to prove the classical reverse shannon theorem can be extended to demonstrate its quantum analog",
    ".    if the qrsc is true , one useful corollary would be the inability of a classical feedback channel from bob to alice to increase @xmath0 .",
    "a causality argument shows that a feedback channel can not increase @xmath0 for noiseless quantum channels . if we could simulate noisy quantum channels by noiseless ones",
    ", this would imply that if a feedback channel increased @xmath0 for any noisy channel , it would have to increase @xmath0 for noiseless ones as well , violating causality .",
