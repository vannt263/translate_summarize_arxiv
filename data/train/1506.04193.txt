    "young moving groups ( ymgs ) are ideal laboratories to study the low - mass end of the initial mass function and obtain age - calibrated samples of brown dwarfs to understand the evolution of their fundamental and atmospheric properties over time .",
    "however , the identification of substellar members of ymgs is challenging because of their intrinsic faintness and sparse distribution on the sky .",
    "these ymgs include e.g. the tw  hydrae association ( twa ; 515myr ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* de la reza et al . 1989 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* kastner et al . 1997 ) ) , tucana - horologium ( tha ; 2040myr ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* torres et al .",
    "2000 ) ) and ab  doradus ( abdmg ; 110130myr ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* zuckerman et al . 2004 ) ) .",
    "* malo et al . ( 2013 ) ) developed the bayesian analysis for nearby young associations ( banyan ) tool to identify new low - mass star members of ymgs in the solar neighborhood .",
    "the biggest power of this tool is that its use of bayes theorem allows it to derive membership probabilities even in scenarios where not all kinematic information is available .",
    "in particular , radial velocity and distance measurements are not available for most low - mass stars , which is primarily due to their relative faintness .",
    "our team built on this tool to create banyan  ii ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* gagn et al . 2014a ) ) , an updated version of the tool that is tailored for the search of brown dwarfs , improved its inherent models of the field and ymgs and made it more efficient so that it became applicable to large data sets .",
    "this allowed us to identify 24 new candidate members of ymgs as well as a new m7.5 bona fide member of tucana - horologium among known low - gravity brown dwarfs .",
    "equipped with the banyan  ii tool , we have undertaken the _",
    "banyan all - sky survey _",
    "( _ bass _ ) , a survey for new brown dwarf candidate members of ymgs from a cross - match of the _ two micron all - sky survey _ ( _ 2mass _ ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* skrutskie et al . 2006 ) ) and the _ allwise _ survey ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* kirkpatrick et al . 2014 ) ) outside of the galactic plane .",
    "we used this cross - match to calculate proper motions with a typical precision of @xmath015@xmath4  and to built an input list of 98970 high - proper motion objects with colors that are consistent with @xmath2m5 dwarfs in the solar neighborhood .",
    "we then used the banyan  ii tool to identify 228 new late - type candidate members of ymgs , including 79 potential brown dwarfs and 22 potential isolated planetary - mass objects . a cross - match with the literature allowed us to estimate our rate of false positives at around @xmath013% in this survey . an additional list of 275 candidates ( the _ low - priority bass _ , or _",
    "lp - bass _ , sample ) was generated with the same method except with more permissive color cuts .    in figure",
    "[ fig : xyzuvw_abdmg ] , we display the most probable galactic positions ( xyz ) and space velocities ( uvw ) for all candidate members of tha that we identified in the _ bass _ survey .",
    "the banyan  ii tool outputs the most likely statistical distances and radial velocities for each target , which allowed us to derive their most probable xyz and uvw .",
    "it can be noted that our candidate members are likely located in the same loci as bona fide members of tha . in the xyz plane , they also follow the plane - shaped distribution of tha members , a property of tha members that was first observed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* kraus et al . ( 2014 ) ) .",
    "as part of this survey , we have identified a low - gravity m6 low - mass star candidate member of tha which was identified as a binary star with a 1214@xmath5  companion at a separation of 84au ( ) , as well as an additional low - gravity m6@xmath1 + l4@xmath1 system ( with a separation of 160au ) also in tha ( * ? ? ? * ( artigau et al . 2015 ) ) .",
    "we also identified the latest - type l dwarf candidate member of twa ( ( * ? ? ? * gagn et al .",
    "2014b ) ) and a @xmath010@xmath5  low - gravity mid - l candidate member of argus ( ( * ? ?",
    "* gagn et al . 2014c ) ) in the first stage of the near - infrared spectroscopic follow - up of the _ bass _ sample .",
    "more recently , we presented the spectroscopic follow - up of a significant portion of _ bass _ ( j. gagn et al .",
    ", submitted to apjs ) , revealing 44 new low - mass stars and 69 brown dwarfs with spectroscopic confirmations of low gravity ( figure  [ fig : spts ] ) . a new l4@xmath1 bona fide member of ab  doradus was also discovered as part of this work ( see figure  [ fig : l4abdor ] ) .",
    "we used these new discoveries and known low - gravity brown dwarfs to create new color - magnitude diagrams ( e.g. , figure  [ fig : cmd ] ) and investigate their fundamental properties using the bt - settl atmosphere models ( ( * ? ? ? * allard et al .",
    "we identified an unexpectedly large number of 1214.5@xmath5  spectroscopically confirmed low - gravity candidate members of tha , where our current follow - up is most sensitive , compared with its main - sequence stellar population ( figure  [ fig : histmass ] ) .",
    "this represents an over - density of a factor @xmath6 .",
    "we find that systematic errors in the atmosphere models are not likely to cause such an over - density , and that the most likely explanation would be a combination of small number statistics and young interlopers from ymgs other than tha .",
    "it will be necessary to obtain radial velocity and parallax measurements to assess whether this is the case or if tha really has an up - turn in the low - mass end of its imf .",
    "we are currently working on an updated version of banyan  ii that will include additional young associations with slightly older ages ( up to @xmath0500myr ) and combine this with a cross - match of _",
    "2mass _ , _ allwise _ , _ sdss _ and _ ukidss _ to identify new @xmath2l5 young brown dwarfs , up into the t dwarfs regime .",
    "our first tests in constructing this survey have already allowed us to identify a new t dwarf bona fide member in ab  doradus .",
    "it is shown in a color - magnitude diagram in figure  [ fig : cmd ] and this result will be presented in j. gagn et al .",
    "( submitted to apjl ) .",
    "we reviewed in this work some discoveries from the banyan all - sky survey that aims at the identification of new low - gravity brown dwarf members of moving groups in the solar neighborhood , and outlined future plans to locate low - gravity t dwarfs in the upcoming years .",
    "these discoveries will serve as important benchmarks to understand the atmospheric properties of giant , gaseous exoplanets and to characterize the low - mass end of the initial mass function ."
