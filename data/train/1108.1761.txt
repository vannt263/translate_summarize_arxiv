    "dominate the interaction between neutral objects making them an essential consideration for micro - electro mechanical devices ( mems ) and atom traps , among others .",
    "the comparison between experimental measurements and theory for casimir forces between metallic plates has been a matter of debate in recent years .",
    "this debate is of particular importance if this comparison is used to derive constraints on hypothetical new short - range interactions appearing in addition to the gravity force in unification models @xcite .",
    "two recent experiments are at the heart of this debate .",
    "casimir force measurements by the iupui group @xcite , performed at distances smaller than 750 nm , were interpreted by the authors as excluding the dissipative drude model and agreeing with the lossless plasma model .",
    "this has led to a discrepancy between experiments and physically motivated theoretical models , such as the drude model , for real conductors which exhibit dissipation . in distinction ,",
    "a recent experiment by the yale @xcite was able to measure casimir forces at distances up to 7 @xmath0 m and was interpreted by the authors as being in agreement with the drude prediction , including quantum as well as thermal fluctuations , once an electrostatic patch contribution has been taken into account .",
    "it is known that patch effects are a source of concern for casimir experiments @xcite , as well as for other precision measurements @xcite . for the yale experiment",
    "the patches were assumed to be much larger than the gap @xmath1 between the spherical and planar plates used in the measurement . under these conditions",
    "the patch force is found to be proportional to @xmath2 in the proximity force approximation ( see below ) , where @xmath3 is the radius of curvature of the spherical plate and @xmath4 is the root - mean - square ( rms ) voltage of electrostatic patch potentials @xcite .",
    "for the iupui experiment , a patch analysis was performed with different assumptions leading to the conclusion that the patch effect had a negligible influence @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , it was not possible in any of these experiments to measure the patches independently .",
    "it follows that the conclusions of the theory - experiment comparisons heavily rely on the patch models used in the data analysis .    in this paper",
    ", we revisit electrostatic patch effects and analyze their possible influence in casimir force measurements .",
    "our approach is based on the method pioneered by speake and trenkel @xcite with the electrostatic patches described in terms of a power spectral density .",
    "however , we will develop a model for the power spectral density differing from the one proposed in @xcite and used in @xcite .",
    "our model is based on the observation that bare metallic surfaces are composed of crystallites , each of which constitutes a single patch , where the local surface voltage is determined by the local work function @xcite . by assuming that through the surface preparation process the crystallographic orientation , and hence the corresponding work function , of each crystallite is determined independently and randomly we can infer that voltage correlations are restricted to points lying on the same patch : we refer to this as _ quasi - local correlation_. our model with quasi - local correlations",
    "can be compared to the case of quenched charge disorder in dielectrics @xcite , and also shows close similarities with models proposed recently to describe patch correlation functions for atomic or ionic traps @xcite .    we will show that the voltage correlation function from our quasi - local model strongly differs from that initially proposed in @xcite and used in @xcite . as a result ,",
    "in contrast to the claims of @xcite , patches may have a significant contribution to the iupui measurements .",
    "in addition we will qualitatively address the issue of surface contamination which is expected to lead to larger correlation lengths and reduced voltage fluctuations @xcite .",
    "given that the degree of contamination is unknown we perform a fit of the patch model we propose to the difference between measurements and the casimir theoretical prediction based on the drude model and find that it qualitatively explains the residual signal . for the yale experiment , our results will essentially reproduce those obtained in @xcite .",
    "in the present section , we recall a few general results of interest , assuming that the validity conditions of the proximity force approximation ( pfa ) are satisfied , that is , the radius of the sphere used in the experiment is much greater than the sphere - plane distance . in this case , the expression for the force gradient @xmath5 ( derivative with distance of the force @xmath6 ) in the sphere - plane geometry is written as follows in terms of the pressure @xmath7 ( the force per unit area ) calculated between two planes @xmath8 this expression is used throughout the paper for both casimir and patch effects .    the basic description of the patch effect after @xcite is a statistical ensemble of patch potentials @xmath9 on the surfaces of two planar plates labeled @xmath10 .",

    "it is also worth mentioning here some conditions for the expression ( [ pressure ] ) of the electrostatic patch pressure between two plates to be valid .",
    "a fundamental assumption in this analysis is that the ergodic hypothesis is satisfied , which means that the distribution of patches within the interaction area is a fair approximation of the ensemble - averaged distribution function defined by the power spectrum @xmath21 $ ] .",
    "when applied to two plane plates of finite area @xmath30 , we expect this assumption to be well satisfied if the effective interaction area contains a large number of patch correlation areas @xmath31 . for the sphere - plane geometry ,",
    "the effective area of interaction is of the order of @xmath32 , leading to the validity requirement @xmath33    in the following two subsections we recall a model used in @xcite and @xcite , and introduce another model with quasi - local correlations which we think to be a better description of sputtered surfaces .",
    "we now discuss the model of patch correlations which was proposed as an example in @xcite and then used in @xcite to assess the contribution of electrostatic patches to the casimir force measurements .",
    "it is a simple description based upon two assumptions : a ) the power spectrum of patches is an annulus in @xmath26-space possessing no other dependence than a sharp cutoff at small ( @xmath34 ) and large ( @xmath35 ) wavevectors ( hence the name _ sharp - cutoff model _ ) ; b ) there are no cross correlations between the two plates ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "this model gives the power spectrum for a single plate as @xmath37 = \\frac { 4\\pi   v_\\mathrm{rms}^2 } { k_\\mathrm{max}^2 - k_\\mathrm{min}^2 } \\theta(k_\\mathrm{max } - k ) \\theta ( k - k_\\mathrm{min}),\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the variance of the potential on one plate and @xmath39 is the heaviside step function .    in order to determine the parameters of this model",
    ", the authors of @xcite used the further assumptions  : c ) based on afm images of the surfaces , the minimum and maximum grain sizes of the samples were determined to be @xmath40 nm and @xmath41 nm  ; d ) the patch sizes were assumed to be the same as the grain sizes and the cutoffs in @xmath26-space were derived from the inverse maximum and minimum grain sizes @xmath42 and @xmath43  ; e ) the rms voltage was obtained by computing the variance of the work functions over the different crystallographic planes of gold , which led to @xmath44 mv .",
    "using the five assumptions a ) to e ) , it was concluded in @xcite that the patch pressure had a negligible influence on the estimation of the casimir force .",
    "a reasonable agreement was then obtained between the experimental data and the prediction for the casimir pressure using the lossless plasma model ( more discussions below ) .",
    "now we will argue that model ( [ stps ] ) is not a good description for the patch power spectrum for the surfaces used in the experiments , and later on , we will also question the relation between patch and grain sizes . in order to make the former point clear ,",
    "let us write the correlation function @xmath45 of patches in real space which can be obtained through an inverse fourier transform ( [ fourierbessel ] ) from the spectrum ( [ stps ] ) @xmath46 as one moves away from coincidence the correlation function @xmath45 oscillates between positive and negative values with a period of the order of the smallest patch size , and is contained within an envelope decaying as @xmath47 ( see fig.[correlation_functions ] ) .",
    "these oscillations imply that the patch potential shows _ correlations _ as well as _ anti - correlations _ in space . such behavior could be expected for surfaces exhibiting some kind of antiferroelectric ordering ( where the configurational energy is minimized when adjacent surface dipoles are antiparallel ) , but will unlikely describe the random potentials on sputtered surfaces",

    "the adsorption of contaminants on the surfaces alters patch sizes which , as a result , do not necessarily correspond to the grain sizes @xcite .",
    "we expect that contamination leads to an effective smearing of the patch layout , so that patch sizes will be larger than grain sizes while the voltage variance will be less than the value obtained for a clean sample from the assumption e ) discussed above .",
    "we now propose another patch model which we think to be a better motivated description of the patch correlation function for the surfaces used in the experiments .    to model the layout of cystallites on a plate , we choose a random patch layout and afterward assign a random potential to each patch .",
    "for a given micro - realization of patches we write the voltage over the whole surface as @xmath49 the sum is over all patches , @xmath50 is a random variable describing the voltage on patch @xmath51 , and the function @xmath52 is defined to be 1 for @xmath53 on the @xmath51th patch , and 0 otherwise .",
    "we now obtain the two - point voltage correlation function by performing ensemble averages over all micro - realizations of the patch voltages and layouts .",
    "physically , the voltage on each site is determined by the crystallite face exposed to the surface . as we assume that each crystallite is deposited with a random crystallographic orientation and that each deposition is statistically independent we can infer that @xmath54 where the expectation value @xmath55 averages over the voltage fluctuations only and @xmath56 is the kronecker delta .",

    "we carry this out by exploiting several symmetries :    1 .",
    "we assume that the patches are distributed uniformly and isotropically which implies that the average patch associated with any given point on the surface is circular with a radius determined from a distribution of patch sizes . in reality",
    "no patch is circular and this notion of _ patch radius _ should only be taken in a statistical sense .",
    "2 .   for any two points on the sample surface ,",

    "one can derive some universal scaling laws for the patch contribution to the pressure in some limiting cases . when the patches are much larger than the gap ( @xmath72 ) , the expression ( [ largepatches ] ) is obtained .",

    "let us stress that quasi - local correlations may be not as accurate for contaminated surfaces as for clean ones .",
    "we employ the above assumptions in a preliminary manner to account for the properties of contaminated surfaces , to be confirmed by dedicated studies to come in the future .",
    "we now compare the theory and experiments by calculating the casimir force from the drude model , and the patch pressure arising from the model with quasi - local correlations . to make the comparison we first calculate the plane - plane casimir pressure @xmath90 at temperature @xmath91 using the lifshitz formula @xcite .",

    "the question we address in the following is whether or not the residual @xmath97 can be explained by a reasonable modeling of patch effects .",

    "2 .   the dotted curve gives the result of the quasi - local model of patch correlations ( [ sm ] ) with parameters determined as was done in @xcite , but here for a different patch spectrum model . as a striking illustration of the importance of this difference , the calculated patch pressure is now larger than the difference between experimental data and theoretical predictions using the drude model .",
    "this illustrates the highly model dependent nature of the computed patch pressure .",
    "thus , patches may be an _ important systematic effect _ for which their contribution to the measured signal should ideally be assessed independently of any casimir force measurement .",

    "this requirement ensures that the effective area of interaction between the sphere and the plane , of the order of @xmath129 for a sphere of radius @xmath3 , contains a large number of elementary patch areas , so that the sum over the micro - realization of patches on a given plate is a good effective description of the statistical ensemble - average given by the power spectral density . with the numbers in @xcite , that is a radius of curvature of the sphere @xmath130 m and a shortest distance @xmath131 nm",

    "a patch analysis was already carried out in @xcite and it led to a good agreement between experimental data and the drude model .",
    "this analysis only considered the asymptotic form @xmath140 of the plane - plane energy due to patches ( [ largepatches ] ) .",
    "here we extend the analysis by using the more general expression ( [ pressure ] ) for the patch pressure with the quasi - local patch correlation function described in subsection ii - b . because we have no information regarding grain or patch sizes in the yale experiment",
    ", we will focus our attention on best - fit estimations of the parameters @xmath141 , @xmath142 , and @xmath143 characterizing the quasi - local patch correlation function ( [ quasi - local - correlation],[sm ] ) .    to analyze yale experimental data we first compute the casimir force using tabulated optical data extrapolated to low frequencies with the drude model using the plasma frequency @xmath144 ev and the dissipation rate @xmath145 ev employed in @xcite .",
    "we set the temperature to be @xmath100k .",
    "the roughness correction to the casimir force is ignored as it gives a negligible correction to the force at the distances considered in the yale experiment .",
    "fig.[stevefit ] shows the difference of the yale experimental force data and the casimir force prediction using the drude model , @xmath146 ( defined by analogy with ( [ residuals ] ) ) , depicted by points with error bars ( we assume no error for the theory ) . the solid curve shows the resulting patch force for parameters arising from a least - squares minimization of the quantity @xmath147 using the quasi - local patch correlation model ( [ sm ] ) described in subsection ii - b .",
    "the best fit parameters are given by @xmath148 m , @xmath149 m , ( corresponding with @xmath150 m ) and @xmath151 mv .",
    "we should point out , however , that the result of the best - fit is essentially insensitive to the details of the patch power spectrum .",
    "indeed , since the residual @xmath126 in the yale experiment has an approximate @xmath73 power law we can infer using ( [ largepatches ] ) that the typical patch size is much larger than @xmath1 for the whole range of distances explored in the experiment ( 0.7 @xmath0 m - 7@xmath0 m ) . performing a constrained fitting by requiring that @xmath141 be less than some predetermined value ( e.g. 500 @xmath0 m ) , yet still satisfying the constraint @xmath152 , we were able to verify that a good fit can still be achieved over a large range of patch sizes . in summary",
    ", we point out the result of our fitting using the more detailed quasi - local patch model confirms the patch treatment in @xcite .     between the data of @xcite and the computed sphere - plane force with the associated patch pressure @xmath153 .",
    "the dots correspond to @xmath146 , with the errors bars including only the experimental error in the force determination .",
    "the solid line is a best - fit of the patch force within the quasi - local model of subsection ii - b .",
    "the inset shows the corresponding residual @xmath154 with the same convention employed in the main figure .",
    ", width=288 ]    finally , we also report for the sake of completeness some supplementary test we performed for comparing the data in @xcite with the predictions of the plasma model described by eq.([generalizedplasma ] ) ( see the inset of fig .",
    "[ stevefit ] ) . the good agreement obtained for the drude model",
    "is dramatically degraded .",
    "therefore , we confirm the result obtained in @xcite that patches can not explain the difference between the experimental data and the plasma model in yale data .",
    "in this paper , we have analyzed the patch contribution to casimir experiments with a model featuring quasi - local voltage correlations .",
    "our model is derived from well - motivated physical principles and shares key features with experimentally verified patch models used to describe ion trap heating and cantilever damping @xcite .",
    "thus , for the description of the surfaces used in the experiments discussed in this paper , we believe that this model is more appropriate than the sharp - cutoff model which has been used to the same aim in previous publications @xcite . due to the large difference in the patch power spectrum , in particular for small wavevectors , the quasi - local model gives a larger contribution than the sharp - cutoff model . as a striking consequence , when the patch sizes are deduced from the grain sizes ( as was done in @xcite ) , the quasi - local model produces a patch pressure larger than the difference between the experimental data and the drude ( and plasma ) casimir prediction , whereas the sharp - cutoff model produces a negligible patch pressure .",
    "therefore , it is important to emphasize that because of the combination of : a ) the highly model dependent nature of the computed patch pressure and b ) the potentially large patch contribution to the measured signal , patches may lead to nonnegligible systematic effects .",
    "this necessitates an independent measurement of patch effects in order to meet metrological standards for casimir force measurements .",
    "we have also used the new quasi - local patch model to fit the difference between experimental data of the iupui experiment @xcite and the theoretical prediction for the casimir pressure .",
    "the latter was computed taking into a ) tabulated optical data extrapolated to low frequencies by means of the drude model , and b ) roughness effects modeled by a simple additive technique .",
    "we have found best - fit parameters for the average patch size and for the rms voltage that are consistent with a contamination of the metallic surfaces , which is expected to enlarge the patch sizes ( with respect to grain sizes ) and smear the patch voltage ( with respect to those of a surface of bare crystallites ) @xcite .",
    "indeed , surface contamination is expected , and we believe that preferential adsorption @xcite and saturation of contaminants may be compatible with the observation of reproducible results in experiments repeated several times with different samples @xcite .    taken together , our results constitute a _ strong warning _ against the previously published claims of an agreement of casimir experiments with the plasma model , and an elimination of the drude model @xcite .",
    "however , we want to emphasize that they do not constitute yet a proof of agreement of experimental data with the new model",
    ". the parameters of the patch model have been fitted and it is still possible that the qualitative agreement thus obtained is a fortunate output of the fitting procedure rather than an explanation of the experimental data .",
    "a better characterization of the surfaces used in the experiments is now key to reaching firmer conclusions .",
    "the patch distributions can be measured with appropriate technologies such as kelvin probe force microscopy which can achieve the necessary size and voltage resolutions @xcite .",
    "in addition , the study of cold atoms and cold ions trapped in the vicinity of metallic surfaces @xcite or the role of patch effects in other precision measurements @xcite are other ways for accessing information of interest for our problem .",
    "let us repeat at this point that our new quasi - local model is similar to recent proposals for patch physics used to achieve a better understanding of atomic and ionic traps @xcite .",
    "the challenges of forthcoming studies may be stated as follows .",
    "first , it is important to confirm the hypothesis that the patch voltages show quasi - local correlations , and to better specify the power spectrum which quantitatively describes these correlations .",
    "second , it would also be interesting to study how the patch power spectrum depends on contamination , in particular , fabrication , treatment , history of the samples , and on temperature .",
    "finally , an independent determination of the patch power spectrum could lead either to a confirmation of the best - fit analysis presented in this paper or to new questions .",
    "this study is important not only for the test of the casimir effect , a central prediction of quantum field theory , but also for the searches of the hypothetical new short - range forces predicted by unification models @xcite .",
