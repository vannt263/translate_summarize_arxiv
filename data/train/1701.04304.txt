    "we obtain an eur by finding an upper bound to @xmath59 . to this aim",

    "plot of the function @xmath74.,title=\"fig : \" ]    this result shows a different behavior of the eur for spin observables in the case of integer spin with respect to the half - integer case .",
    "a simple example of the latter is the qubit case : it was shown in @xcite that for qubits we have @xmath75 , but the minimum is achieved by any of the eigenstates of one of the @xmath54 in contrast to the qutrit case obtained here .",
    "this difference in behavior between integer and half - integer spins is true also for larger spin numbers ( see below ) . + a straightforward generalization of ( [ mu spin 1 ] )",

    "it is weaker than our bound .      for a four - dimensional system ,",
    "we are unaware of a representation of the density matrix in terms of the spin observables and we can not reproduce the derivation given for @xmath20 .",
    "we thus develop a simple computational method that gives tight eur for small system dimensions @xmath16 .",
    "an arbitrary pure state @xmath78 of a @xmath16-dimensional system depends on @xmath79 real parameters .",
    "it is sufficient to consider pure states because of the concavity of the shannon entropy : mixed states have greater entropy .",

    "considering @xmath83 observables @xmath84 we can calculate the quantity @xmath85 , which can be seen as a function of the @xmath79 parameters representing the state .",
    "this function can then be numerically minimized over this parameter space .",
    "in addition to finding the minimum , we then also find the states that saturate the bounds , which are then tight . in the appendix we give more details on the computational procedure , here we present only the results .",
    "for the case of two spin observables we find @xmath86 with @xmath22 and @xmath23 .    to compare this result with the previous results of @xcite and @xcite",

    "the bound is not saturated by one of the eigenstates of @xmath54 , indeed for any eigenstate we have @xmath97 instead , it is saturated by the state @xmath98 and by similar superpositions weighted by the angle @xmath99 the bound ( [ 4d 2spin ] ) is in agreement with the numerical bound found in @xcite , but here we find also the state that achieves the minimum .    for the case of three spin observables",
    "we find @xmath100 if we employ ( [ 4d 2spin ] ) to obtain a bound for three observables , ( by applying it to each pair of observables ) we find @xmath101 which is weaker than ( [ 4d eur spin ] ) .",
    "the same argument applied to @xmath91 of leads to @xmath102 : also in this case our result is stronger than previous ones .",
    "the lower bound is achieved by the eigenstates of any of three observables @xmath54 .",
    "this generalizes the result found by sanchez in @xcite : indeed in this case the mubs represent also the spin components .",
    "as mentioned above , the eur for half - integer and integer spin values are attained for different classes of states .",
    "a spin @xmath103 system has dimension @xmath30 . using the same algorithm detailed in the previous section , we find @xmath104",
    "both the above inequalities are saturated by the eigenstates corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath105 of any of the three observables @xmath106 , the null projection state ( as in the case @xmath20 ) .",
    "for example , the above inequalities are saturated by the state @xmath107    the comparison of ( [ spin 2 eur 2 obs ] ) with the previously known bounds @xmath92 , @xmath90 and @xmath108 shows that , again , our result is stronger .",
    "in fact , in this case we have @xmath93 and @xmath109 .",
    "therefore , @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 , which are weaker than ( [ spin 2 eur 2 obs ] ) . instead ,",
    "the numerical bound found in @xcite agrees with ours , but we also provide the states that saturate it .",
    "if we consider the application of ( [ spin 2 eur 3 obs ] ) to three spin observables we would obtain @xmath113 which is weaker than ( [ spin 2 eur 3 obs ] ) : the three - observable bound is again stronger than the ones obtained by joining two - observable bounds .",
    "we now consider the eurs relative to observables that have mutually unbiased bases ( mubs ) as eigenstates ( the eigenvalues are irrelevant for the eurs ) . to obtain the eurs we use the same procedure detailed in sec .",
    "[ s : spin32 ] .",
    "however , we must also calculate the mubs for each dimension . in a @xmath16-dimensional hilbert space there exist @xmath114 mubs if @xmath16 is a power of a prime , otherwise only three bases are known to exist @xcite .",
    "the proprieties of mubs strongly depend on the dimension , e.g.  for a qubit , mubs are also the eigenbases of the spin observables , but this is not true for @xmath115 . the problem of finding mubs can be translated into finding hadamard matrices : the columns of such matrices are the states of the mubs .",
    "this problem was solved in @xcite for dimensions @xmath116 .",
    "here we use that result to study eurs : for each dimension @xmath1 we consider up to @xmath114 observables @xmath117 that have mubs as eigenstates .",
    "we now briefly review previous results for eurs with mubs observables . for any number @xmath118 of these observables",
    ", we can construct an eur with a trivial generalization of maassen and uffink s relation ( [ mu eur ] ) by applying to pairs of bases , obtaining @xmath119 however , this inequality is almost never tight . a better bound",
    "was given in @xcite for @xmath120 : @xmath121 which is also not always tight .",
    "for even dimension @xmath16 , a stronger bound was given in @xcite : @xmath122 which is tight only in dimension two . for @xmath123 in @xcite",
    "it has been shown that if the hilbert space dimension is a square , that is @xmath124 then for @xmath125 the inequality ( [ generalization of mu eur ] ) is tight , namely @xmath126 a further bound for @xmath123 was given in @xcite : @xmath127 for more details on the above bounds , we refer to @xcite .",
    "we now present our results which are tight for all dimensions and all numbers @xmath118 of mubs .      in dimension @xmath26",
    "four mubs exist @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 and @xmath131 , whose states are respectively given by the columns of the hadamard matrices @xmath132 with @xmath133 .",
    "if the system is prepared in an eigenstate of any of the mubs , the entropy of that observable is null while the other entropies are maximal : e.g.  if @xmath134 , then we have @xmath135 .",
    "in contrast to the qubit case @xmath15 , this is _ not _ the state that gives the strongest eur for @xmath26 .",
    "indeed , the state @xmath136 has entropies for all mubs equal to @xmath32 : @xmath137 .",
    "therefore , @xmath138 we have numerically shown that the above inequalities are the optimal ones .",
    "in addition to the above state , they are saturated also by the following states @xmath139 where @xmath140 .",
    "our bound is stronger than ( [ generalization of mu eur ] ) , which in this case gives @xmath141 .",
    "for @xmath142 the bound ( [ archas ] ) gives @xmath143 , that is also weaker than ( [ 3d 3mubs ] ) .",
    "for a complete set of mubs @xmath144 , the bound ( [ ivanovic ] ) gives @xmath145 and is then equal to our relation .",
    "however , here we have proven that ( [ 3d 4mubs ] ) is a tight relation for @xmath26 , and we have provided the states achieve the minimum .      in dimension @xmath28",
    "five mubs exist , whose states are given by the columns of the hadamard matrices @xmath146 since @xmath147 is a square for @xmath148 , then for @xmath149 the inequality is tight @xcite .",
    "this is then the best bound up to @xmath150 .",
    "however , for @xmath28 we can consider up to @xmath151 .",
    "for example , for @xmath142 we find that the optimal bound is @xmath152 it is achieved by the four states @xmath153 by symmetry , similar relations holds by permuting the mubs observables , but involving the superposition of different eigenstates .",
    "for example @xmath154 has lower bound achieved by @xmath155 and @xmath156 .    in the case of @xmath144",
    "observables we find @xmath157 as the optimal bound , which is saturated by the states @xmath158 compare our bound ( [ 4d 4mubs ] ) to ( [ ballester ] ) and : for @xmath144 we find @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "therefore , our inequality is stronger than both .    in the case of @xmath161 observables ( the complete set of mubs ) , we find @xmath162 which is saturated by states of the following form : @xmath163 with @xmath164 and @xmath72 and @xmath165 are the eigenstates of @xmath128 .",
    "for @xmath28 the inequality ( [ sanchez ] ) gives @xmath166 , so that ( [ sanchez ] ) is weaker than our bound ( [ 4d 5mubs ] ) in this case .      in dimension @xmath30",
    "six mubs exist , whose states are given by the columns of the hadamard matrices @xmath167 with @xmath168 . for three mubs observables",
    "we find that the optimal bound is @xmath169 which is saturated by any eigenstate of any of the three mubs , as in the qubit @xmath15 case ( also there the eur for three complementary observables is saturated by the eigenstates of the observables ) .",
    "the bound is the only known entropic uncertainty relation , apart from the qubit case , with more than two observables that has this property . in this respect , it is somewhat similar to maassen and uffink s : they are both achieved by the eigenstates of one of the observables ( so that the entropies of the others are maximum ) . for @xmath142 in ( [ archas ] ) we have @xmath170 while @xmath171 our bound is stronger than these also in this case .    for four mubs",
    "we find that the optimal bound is @xmath172 and the minimum is achieved by states that are superposition of four basis states , e.g. @xmath173 in this case we have @xmath174 , that is again weaker than our bound . for five mubs we find @xmath175 and , finally , for the complete set of six mubs we find @xmath176 the two above inequalities are again minimized by states that can be expressed by the superposition of four basis states , having the same form of ( [ stato 5d ] ) . for @xmath151 we can compare to which gives a weaker bound @xmath177 , while for the complete set of mubs we can compare to ( [ ivanovic ] ) , which gives a weaker bound @xmath178 .",
    "in this paper we have found several tight entropic uncertainty relations for two classes of observables : the spin observables @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and the observables @xmath25 with mubs eigenstates .    for the case of spin observables , for @xmath20 we found a tight relation ( [ eur qutrit spin ] ) for the complete set of spin observables , its minimum value is achieved by null projection states of any of three observables .",
    "the same types of states saturate also the inequality ( [ spin 2 eur 3 obs ] ) for the case of @xmath179 . instead , in the case @xmath180 the inequality ( [ 4d eur spin ] ) is minimized by eigenstates of any of three spin observables . for both @xmath180 and @xmath179",
    "we have also found tight inequalities for two spin observables , which are in agreement with the optimal bound found in @xcite , and we have given the states that minimize them . in the case of @xmath179",
    "they are the null projections states .    for the case of mubs observables",
    ", we have derived several tight inequalities for dimensions @xmath1 .",
    "for @xmath26 the results ( [ 3d 4mubs ] ) equals the previous bound ( [ ivanovic ] ) but here we also found the class of states that saturates it . in contrast , for @xmath181 , the bounds ( [ 4d 5mubs ] ) and ( [ 5d 6mubs ] ) represent stronger eur than known ones .",
    "new inequalities have been also found for incomplete sets of mubs in every dimension : in each case the new bounds are tight and we have derived the states that achieve the minimum .",
