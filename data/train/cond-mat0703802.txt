    "mesoscopic physics concerns with the properties of small systems with sizes in the range from of a few nanometers to micrometers , at low temperatures typically below 1 k. the constant progress in nano - fabrication techniques allows for a controlled realization of these structures and a consequent increasing interest in this physics .",
    "hybrid superconducting systems are mesoscopic devices constituted by normal and superconducting parts in electrical contact .",
    "characteristic of superconductivity is the macroscopic phase coherence of the order parameter and the supercurrent flow . on the one hand",
    ", superconductivity adds new degrees of freedom and makes the physics of mesoscopic systems richer . on the other hand ,",
    "superconducting properties are deeply influenced by mesoscopic effects as it is the case of charging effects in small superconducting junctions .",
    "this brief introduction makes evident that the field of hybrid mesoscopic superconducting systems is vast and diversified .",
    "it is our intention to give a general overview of the field , pointing to the relevant references for a more detailed analysis , and to keep the presentation as simple as possible .",
    "the paper is divided in five sections ( including this introduction ) which are almost independent among themselves .",
    "we begin , in section ii , by introducing the basic properties of hybrid systems whose electrical transport is dominated by the conversion of normal current into supercurrent which takes place at the interface .",
    "we give , for educational purposes , an introduction to the technique of the bogoliubov - de gennes equations combined to the scattering approach for the study of transport in hybrid systems . the complementary approach using quasiclassical green functions",
    "is then briefly introduced , however we refer to the existing literature for a more detailed presentation . in section iii",
    "we introduce the heat - transport properties of hybrid systems in order to discuss the effectiveness of such systems as electronic coolers . in section",
    "iv we provide a presentation on the superconducting properties in small systems where charging effects are dominant .",
    "basics in superconductivity and josephson physics can be found in the books by tinkham  @xcite and by barone and patern  @xcite .",
    "since many ideas discussed here belong to the field of more traditional mesoscopic physics we refer for these topics to the books by beenakker and van houten  @xcite and imry  @xcite and to the conference proceedings  @xcite .",
    "excellent introductions to single charge tunneling can be found in refs .",
    "we also refer to the recent reviews on hybrid structures  @xcite and ultra - small superconductors  @xcite for a more complete description of these topics and a more complete list of references .",
    "a fascinating aspect of mesoscopics is the possibility of fabricating hybrid nanostructures formed from combinations of normal conductors ( n ) and superconductors ( s ) .",
    "the interest for these systems stems from the fact that the nature of charge transport is dramatically different in the normal and in the superconducting constituents of the heterostructure , giving rise to a rich variety of effects .",
    "while the charge current in n is carried by quasi - particle excitations ( electrons in a metal ) , at sufficiently low energy ( e.g. temperature , applied voltage , frequency , ... ) the current in s is carried by the superconducting condensate , which is a many body ground state property of the system , and flows without dissipation .",
    "the matching between these two different charge transport mechanisms can be well understood for phase - coherent structures in terms of the so - called _ andreev reflection _",
    ". this can be introduced starting from the microscopic bcs theory of superconductivity @xcite . in the presence of boundaries and non - uniformities",
    "it is convenient to perform an approximate fourier transform of the bcs hamiltonian . making use of the hartree approximation ,",
    "one arrives to an effective single - particle hamiltonian which leads to the bogoliubov - de gennes equation @xcite @xmath0 for the coherence factors @xmath1 and @xmath2 , where the energy @xmath3 is measured from the condensate chemical potential .",
    "this is a matrix eigenvalue equation which contains the single - particle hamiltonian @xmath4 describing electrons in the superconductor in the absence of the attractive potential , and the time - reversal of such a hamiltonian ( @xmath5 ) , which describes the hole degree of freedom .",
    "the off - diagonal term @xmath6 , which introduces a coupling between electrons and holes , is given by the product of the point - like electron - electron attractive potential and the pairing amplitude describing superconducting correlations among electrons .",
    "the pairing amplitude , proportional to the anomalous average @xmath7 can be understood as being the wave function of the cooper pairs . since @xmath6 , which is the superconducting order parameter ,",
    "is determined by the coherence factors , it should be calculated self - consistently . in the absence of superconductivity ( @xmath8 )",
    "the system is described in terms of decoupled electrons and holes , the latter being characterized by having group velocity and wave - vector in opposite directions , as well as opposite charge and spin with respect to electrons . when an electronic attractive interaction is present ( @xmath9 ) , electron and hole degrees of freedom get mixed forming particle - like and hole - like quasi - particles . as a result , a gap of amplitude @xmath10 opens up in the energy spectrum ( see fig .",
    "[ andreevreflection]a ) forbidding quasi - particles excitations with energy inside the gap to propagate in the superconductor .",
    "let us now consider a piece of normal metal in contact with a superconductor and assume that electrons of a given energy @xmath11 are injected from the normal part toward the ns interface .",
    "as explained above , such electrons can not propagate through the superconductor , in fact they are allowed to penetrate as an evanescent wave up to a depth of the order of the bcs superconducting coherence length @xmath12 .",
    "they can however undergo two different processes . in the first one , _ normal reflection _ , electrons are reflected back into the normal slab and do not contribute to the charge current ( see fig .",
    "[ andreevreflection]b ) .",
    "the second one is made possible by the electron - hole coupling term of the bogoliubov - de gennes hamiltonian and consists in the coherent evolution of the incoming electron into a retro - reflected hole ( see fig . [",
    "andreevreflection]c ) .",
    "this constitutes the _ andreev reflection _ process , which is indeed responsible for charge transport , and corresponds to the transfer of a pair of electrons from the normal side of the interface to the superconducting condensate .",
    "noteworthy , each andreev reflection process contributes of @xmath13 to the charge current .",
    "it is important to notice that andreev reflection does not contribute to the transport of energy , since no excitations are transferred into the superconductor .",
    "while providing good charge conductivity , ns interfaces prove to be good thermal insulators .",
    "andreev reflection also accounts for the influence that the superconductor exerts on the normal conductor , known as _ proximity effect_. in much the same way as the quasi - particle excitations penetrate the superconductor , the superconductor pairing amplitude also leaks out into the normal side of ns contact over a large distance , of the order of the superconducting coherence length , even in the absence of an attractive interaction . as a result , partial superconducting properties are induced into the normal conductor .    in the next section ( [ derivebdg ] )",
    "we will give a derivation ( following ref .",
    "@xcite ) of the bogoliubov - de gennes equation , while in section [ solvebdg ] we shall solve such an equation for different systems . in the following sections we shall describe the two most widely used theoretical approaches applied to study hybrid systems , namely the scattering formalism ( section [ scattering ] ) , which we will analyze in details , and the quasi - classical green s function theory ( section [ green ] ) . in section [ results ] we shall review the most important results attained in the field .",
    "as mentioned above , the bogoliubov - de gennes equation is derived from the bcs theory . in this section",
    "we show how to derive such an equation in the general case where an exchange field is present .",
    "this will be useful for studying hybrid structures in which ferromagnets are present too .",
    "it is convenient to make use of the bogoliubov s self - consistent field method @xcite .",
    "the starting point is the following hamiltonian in the second quantization form : @xmath14 where the second term accounts for the electron - electron coupling , which is assumed to be a point - like , two - particle interaction ( introduced for the first time by gorkov @xcite ) and independent of spin , therefore characterized by a single coefficient @xmath15 . in eq .",

    ", we want to remark that ferromagnetism is introduced according to the stoner model ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in this model a molecular field , due to the permanent magnetization present in a ferromagnet , replaces the external magnetic field in the zeeman energy , and it is added to the single - particle energy . such a molecular field can be obtained calculating the exchange interaction in a system of spins using the mean field approximation ( see ref .",

    "@xcite ) , such a hamiltonian describes a particle which moves in a mean - field potential produced by all other particles . using the variational principle",

    "the key feature of the mean - field theory of superconductivity is that we admit non - vanishing expectation values for the spin - paired operators @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "if we consider @xmath30 in ( [ heffe ] ) , we see that , on the one hand , the terms in @xmath41 and @xmath42 destroy and create one electron and therefore conserves the number of particles . on the other hand ,",
    "the terms in @xmath6 increases or decreases the number of particles by 2 .",
    "this is not a problem , since @xmath30 operates on the bcs wave function which is not an eigenfunction of the number operator .",

    "in addition , in light of a possible exploitation of this structure with a n region ( i.e. , a sfn cooler ) it turned out that cooling effects comparable to the sf case can be achieved with f - layer thickness of a few nm ( i.e. , of the order of the magnetic lenght ) .",
    "the above given results point out the necessity of strongly spin - polarized ferromagnets for a proper operation of the sf cooler . among the predicted half - metallic candidates it is possible to indicate cro@xmath335 @xcite , for which values of @xmath339 in the range @xmath369 have been reported @xcite , ( co@xmath370fe@xmath371s@xmath335 @xcite , nimnsb @xcite , sr@xmath335femoo@xmath372 @xcite and nimnv@xmath335 @xcite .",
    "so far no experimental realizations of sf structures for cooling applications were reported .",
    "the main technological problems seem , still nowadays , to avoid degradation of ferromagnetic properties at the sf interface and a proper integration with suitable superconductors .",
    "the astonishing progress in modern technology has made it possible to fabricate in a controlled way tunnel junctions with capacitances of the order of @xmath373f and below . in this case",
    "even the charging energy associated with a single - electron accumulation at the junction , @xmath374 , can be of the order of several kelvins .",
    "this implies that the properties in the sub - kelvin regime are strongly affected by the presence of charging effects . indeed charging energy allows the control of the electron number of small islands with precision @xmath153 or @xmath13 in the case of superconducting devices .",
    "adding one electron to a small superconducting island puts it into an excited state with an energy exceeding the gap .",
    "only when a second electron is added , can both recombine to form a cooper pair .",
    "this leads to _ parity effects _ ,",
    "i.e. to different properties of the superconducting systems depending on the number of electrons being even or odd .    the relevant mechanisms for charge transport in superconducting single - electron devices are quasi - particle tunneling , two - particles tunneling and coherent tunneling of cooper pairs .",
    "all of them are strongly affected by charging .",
    "tunneling of quasi - particles is very similar to the case of normal metals but taking into account the modified bcs density of states .",
    "two - particle tunneling is a higher order process related to the andreev reflection discussed previously .",
    "both two - particle tunneling and coherent oscillations of cooper pairs dominate transport at very low voltages .",
    "moreover , the interplay of charging and coherent tunneling has a deep significance because it leads to the possibility of observing macroscopic quantum dynamics in these systems . the charge and the phase difference in a josephson junction , although being macroscopic degrees of freedom , are quantum mechanical conjugate variables",
    ". therefore the eigenstates are in general superpositions of different charge states .",
    "in addition the combination of coherent cooper pair tunneling and quasi - particle tunneling , leads to a variety of structures in the @xmath375-@xmath15 characteristic .",
    "there are numerous examples of systems where single - electron properties and superconductivity have been studied theoretically and realized experimentally .",
    "a prototype example which we will analyze is the nsn - set transistor where a superconducting island is connected to two normal conducting leads by means of tunnel junctions .",
    "this example allows to discuss both quasi - particle and two - particles tunneling .",
    "we then discuss some basic properties of the coherent oscillations of cooper pairs which will be important for the discussion on the implementation of quantum computers by means of superconducting nanocircuits .    as prototype examples to discuss charging effects in superconducting nanostructures we consider the single - electron ( set ) transistor shown in fig .",
    "[ transistor]a and the single - electron box of fig .",
    "[ transistor]b . here",
    "we concentrate on the transistor , while the box will be analyzed in the section devoted to quantum computation . the charging energy of the set transistor depends on the electron number in the central island and on the applied voltages .",
    "the central island is coupled via two tunnel junctions to a transport voltage source , @xmath376 , so that a current can flow .",
    "the island is , furthermore , coupled capacitively to a gate voltage @xmath377 .",
    "the charging energy of the system depends on the integer number of excess electrons @xmath378 on the island and on the continuously varied voltages .",
    "elementary electrostatics yields the `` charging energy '' @xmath379 here @xmath380 is the total capacitance of the island .",
    "the effect of the voltage sources is contained in the gate - charge @xmath381 .",
    "similar expressions hold for the single - electron box .    in a tunneling process which changes the number of excess electrons in the island from @xmath47 to @xmath382 , the charging energy changes .",
    "tunneling from the left junction to the island is possible at low temperatures only if the energy in the left lead , @xmath383 , is high enough to compensate for the increase in charging energy @xmath384 .",
    "similarly , tunneling from the island ( transition from @xmath382 to @xmath47 ) to the right lead is possible at low temperatures only if @xmath385 .",
    "both conditions have to be satisfied simultaneously for a current to flow through the transistor .",
    "if this is not the case , the current is exponentially suppressed realizing the so - called _",
    "coulomb blockade_. varying the gate voltage produces coulomb oscillations , i.e. an @xmath153-periodic dependence of the conductance on @xmath386 . to further understand the characteristic of a set transistor we need to determine the tunneling rates associated to electron tunneling .",
    "an electron tunnels from one of the states @xmath113 in the left lead into one of the available states @xmath114 in the island , thereby changing the electron number from @xmath47 to @xmath382 , with rate @xmath387 . such a rate , which is calculated by means of the fermi golden rule , can be expressed in a transparent way as @xmath388 the function @xmath389 is the quasi - particle tunneling characteristic ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which is suppressed at voltages below the superconducting gap(s ) and @xmath390 is the charging energy difference between the states with @xmath47 and @xmath382 electrons in the island .",
    "charging effects reduce the quasi - particle tunneling further . at low temperatures , @xmath391 , a tunneling process which would increase the charging energy is suppressed .",
    "this phenomenon is called _ coulomb blockade _ of electron tunneling . at zero temperature",
    "the rate is nonzero only if the gain in charging energy compensates the energy needed to create the excitations @xmath392 .",
    "the rates describe the stochastic time evolution of the charge of the junction system . for the theoretical analysis",
    "a master equation approach can be used .",
    "several examples of the current - voltage characteristics of normal metal can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite , an important characteristic is the @xmath153-periodic dependence of the current and conductance on the applied gate charge .    as dictated by eq .",
    "( [ ratesc ] ) , the rate for quasi - particle tunneling are exponentially suppressed below the superconducting gap . in this case",
    "higher - order processes involving multi - electron tunneling can play a role .",
    "indeed , for ns interfaces , there still exists a 2-electron tunneling process , in many respects similar to the andreev reflection discussed in the previous section and for this reason denoted as andreev tunneling .",
    "the rate for andreev tunneling taking into account charging effects was discussed in ref .",
    "andreev tunneling is a second - order coherent process . in the first part of the transition",
    "one electron is transferred from an initial state , e.g. @xmath393 of the normal lead , into an intermediate excited state @xmath394 of the superconducting island . in the second part of the coherent transition , an electron tunnels from @xmath395 into the partner state @xmath396 of the first electron , such that both form a cooper pair .",
    "the final state contains two excitations in the normal lead and an extra cooper pair in the superconducting island , and the rates reads : @xmath397 note that the functional dependence of this rate coincides with that for single - electron tunneling in a normal junction , eq .",
    "( [ ratesc ] ) , with a linear @xmath398 characteristics .",
    "hence andreev reflection is subject to coulomb blockade like normal - state single - electron tunneling  @xcite with the exception that the charge transferred in an andreev reflection is @xmath13 , and the charging energy changes accordingly .",
    "the effective andreev conductance is of second - order in the tunneling conductance and , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , is sensitive to spatial correlations in the normal metal , which can be expressed by the cooperon propagator .    in a normal - metal electron box",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ transistor]b ) , by sweeping the applied gate voltage the the number of electrons on the island in unit of @xmath153 and , as a consequence , the voltage of the island shows a periodic saw - tooth behavior  @xcite .",
    "the periodicity in the gate charge @xmath386 is @xmath153 . if the island is superconducting and the gap @xmath6 smaller than the charging energy @xmath399 , the charge and the voltage show at low temperatures a characteristic long - short cyclic , @xmath13-periodic dependence on @xmath386 .",
    "this effect arises because single - electron tunneling from the ground state , where all electrons near the fermi surface of the superconducting island are paired , leads to a state where one extra electron  the `` odd '' one  is in an excited state  @xcite . in a small island ,",
    "as long as charging effects prevent further tunneling , the odd electron does not find another excitation for recombination .",
    "hence the energy of this state stays above that of the equivalent normal system by the gap energy . only at larger gate voltages",
    "can another electron enter the island , and the system can relax to the ground state .",
    "this scenario repeats with periodicity @xmath13 in @xmath386 , as displayed in fig .",
    "[ figsuperparab ] .",
    "parity effects appear at temperatures lower than a crossover temperature @xmath400 which , in the experiments , is typically of the order of @xmath401 of @xmath402 . at low temperatures",
    "the even - odd asymmetry has been observed in the single - electron box  @xcite as well as in the @xmath375-@xmath15 characteristics of superconducting set transistor  @xcite .",
    "however , at higher temperatures , above a cross - over value @xmath403 , the @xmath153-periodic behavior typical for normal - metal systems is recovered .",
    "the analysis sketched above can be used to analyze the @xmath375-@xmath15 characteristics of set transistors with a superconducting island , the so - called nsn transistor .",
    "the interplay of parity effects and andreev tunneling makes the current - voltage characteristics quite rich . if the energy gap is smaller than the charging energy the important processes are single - electron tunneling processes in the left and right junction , causing transitions between even and odd states .",
    "in the opposite limit of a superconducting gap bigger than the charging energy , the odd states have a large energy and andreev tunneling , with rate given by eq .",
    "( [ ratea ] ) , becomes important  @xcite .    at low temperatures , and superconducting gap larger than the charging energy , a set of parabolic current peaks",
    "is found centered around the degeneracy points @xmath404",
    "@xcite @xmath405 here @xmath406 for @xmath386 close to e , and similarly near the other degeneracy points . at larger transport voltages ,",
    "single - electron tunneling sets in , even if @xmath407 , and andreev reflection gets `` poisoned '' @xcite .",
    "this occurs for @xmath408    fig .",
    "[ figssz3 ] shows the current - voltage characteristic of a nsn transistor with @xmath407  @xcite . at small transport",
    "voltages the 2e - periodic peaks due to andreev reflection dominate ; they get poisoned above a threshold voltage . the peaks at larger transport voltages arise from a combination of single - electron tunneling and andreev reflection .",
    "the shape and size of the even - even andreev peaks and some of the single - electron tunneling features at higher transport voltages agree well with those observed in the experiments of hergenrother et al .",
    "in this review we tried to present an overall description of mesoscopic hybrid structures .",
    "the field is so vast that the choice of the topics was surely biased by our personal taste and by our field of investigations . to summarize",
    ", we have started this review by illustrating the transport properties of hybrid systems formed by putting into contact superconductors with normal metals and ferromagnets . in section",
    "ii we have introduced the bogoliubov - de gennes equation in order to discuss transport properties in terms of andreev processes .",
    "we have then provided a derivation of the bogoliubov - de gennes equation starting from the bcs theory and given the solutions of such an equation for two different systems , namely a homogeneous superconductor and a ferromagnet/ superconductor junction .",
    "after that we have introduced the two most important theoretical approaches to the study of transport properties in hybrid systems .",
    "we chose to give a more detailed treatment of the scattering theory , deriving general conductance formul  in terms of scattering matrices and giving explicit expressions for the case of two - probe systems .",
    "the quasi - classical green s function approach has also been discussed , although in less details , and a review of the most important results has been provided . in section",
    "ii we have considered the heat transport in sn and sf structures to discuss the very efficient electronic cooling properties of hybrid systems .",
    "section iii has been devoted to the coulomb blockade , which is present in small metallic grains where charging effects are important , in hybrid systems .",
    "we have discussed parity effects in single - electron transistors containing a superconducting island and their consequences on the quasi - particle tunneling rates .",
    "i - v characteristics has been furthermore illustrated .",
    "it is quite hard to draw conclusions and even harder to advance ideas about possible future directions of the field .",
    "nevertheless we take this risk and briefly outline what we believe ( remaining conservative ) will be the future development of the field .",
    "a direction which is not fully studied up to now is the role of superconductivity in molecular electronics .",
