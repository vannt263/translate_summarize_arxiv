    "although the methods and techniques have been greatly improved since the late nineteenth century , the precision on the measurement of the gravitational constant , g , is still the less accurate in comparison with the other fundamental constants of nature @xcite .",
    "moreover , given the relative uncertainties of most of the individual experiments ( reaching about @xmath2 for the most precise measurements ) , they show an incompatibility which leads to an overall precision of only about 1 part in @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "thus the current status of the @xmath4 terrestrial measurements ( see @xcite ) implies either an unknown source of errors ( not taken into account in the published uncertainties ) , or some new physics @xcite . in the latter spirit , many theories have been proposed as candidates for the unification of physics .",
    "as such , they involve a coupling between gravitation and electromagnetism ( hereafter ge coupling ) , as well as with other fields present .",
    "the kaluza - klein theories @xcite have been among the first attempts to unify electromagnetism and gravitation .",
    "although they are disqualified in their original form , they constitute the prototype for many present theories ( in particular , those involving extra - dimensions ) . in the laboratory conditions for g - measurements , fundamental theories as well as kk theories",
    "are well described as an _ effective _ theory , under the form of the einstein and maxwell equations conveniently modified , as described below .",
    "this paper explores the possibility that the discrepancy between the results of the g - measurements is the effect of the ge coupling , by comparing the available data to the predictions of such an effective theory .",
    "we do not pretend that the effective theory adopted here ( kk@xmath1 , see below ) is the only possibility .",
    "rather , we consider that it provides the simplest opportunity to confront the idea of a ge coupling with real data .",
    "the success of the fit suggests that this may be the real explanation .",
    "the simplest theories accounting for a ge coupling are those of kaluza - klein @xcite , or slight modifications of them .",
    "their use corresponds to the most economical way ( the minimum of hypotheses ) to test the hypothesis of ge coupling .",
    "as it is well known , such theories are effectively well described by einstein equations ( with their correct newtonian limit ) , where the newtonian gravitational constant @xmath4 is replaced by @xmath5 , given below : this effective gravitational constant depends of the fifteenth degree of freedom , @xmath6 , of the ( 5-dimensional ) bulk metric , which plays the role of a ( four dimensional ) scalar field @xmath0 ( @xmath7 in the jordan - fierz frame ) .",
    "the genuine five dimensional kaluza - klein theories being subject to instabilities ( @xcite ) , various authors ( @xcite ) have suggested a more acceptable version which includes an additional _ stabilizing _ external bulk field : here we adopt the minimal hypothesis of a scalar field @xmath8 minimally coupled to gravity . in this theory ( hereafter kk@xmath1 ) , @xmath5 varies with the electromgnetic field , and thus in spacetime .",
    "however , only variations with respect to the cosmic distance or time have been investigated in the literature hitherto .",
    "but , since the geomagnetic field varies , with latitude and longitude , and thus at the different sites of the @xmath4 measurements , the ge coupling implies that the experiments in fact measure the distinct corresponding values of @xmath5 , rather than an unique value of @xmath4 .",
    "note also that this theory predicts a variation of the effective fine structure constant @xmath9 with the gravitational field , and thus with the cosmological time . in a companion paper ( @xcite ) , we compare ( with success ) the predicted evolution with astrophysical data concerning the distant quasars ( @xcite ) .",
    "in section 2 we recall the definition of the effective coupling constants , and the effective maxwell - einstein equations , issued from the five dimensional compactified kk theory stabilized by a minimally coupled bulk scalar field . in section 3 , we calculate the vacuum solutions on earth , in the weak field limit , taking into account the geomagnetic field . in section 4 , we confront the predicted values of @xmath5 with the laboratory measurements . in section 5 , we discuss the consistency of our results with respect to the orbital motion of the lageos satellite , the moon and planets of the solar system , as well as the binary pulsar psr@xmath10 .",
    "an argument initially from landau and lifshitz @xcite may be applied to the pure kaluza - klein ( kk ) action ( @xcite ) : the negative sign of the kinetic term of the kk internal scalar field leads to inescapable instability .",
    "stabilization may however be obtained if an external field is present ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , and we assume here a version kk@xmath1 of the kk theory which includes an external bulk scalar field minimally coupled to gravity .",
    "after dimensional reduction ( @xmath11 ) , this bulk field reduces to a four dimensional scalar field @xmath12 and , in the jordan - fierz frame , the low energy effective action takes the form ( up to a total divergence ) @xmath13 \\,d^{4}x\\ ] ] @xmath14 \\,d^{4}x,\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the potential 4-vector of the electromagnetic field , @xmath16 the electromagnetic field strength tensor , @xmath17 the self - interaction potential of @xmath1 and @xmath18 its source term .",
    "following lichnerowicz @xcite , we interpret the quantity @xmath19 of the einstein - hilbert term , and the factor @xmath20 of the maxwell term respectively as the effective gravitational `` constant '' and the effective vacuum dielectric permittivity .",
    "the effective vacuum magnetic permeability reads @xmath21 , so that the velocity of light in vacuum remains a true universal constant .",
    "both terms depend solely on the local ( for local physics ) or global ( at cosmological scale ) value of the kk scalar field @xmath0 , assumed to be positive defined .",
    "the source term of the @xmath1-field , @xmath18 , includes the contributions of the ordinary matter ( other than the scalar fields @xmath1 and @xmath0 ) , of the electromagnetic field and of the internal scalar field @xmath0 . for each",
    ", the coupling is defined by a function ( temperature dependent , as for the potential @xmath17 ) @xmath22 , where the subscript @xmath23 stands for `` matter '' , `` em '' and `` @xmath0 '' . in order to recover the einstein - maxwell equations in the weak fields limit , these three functions are subject to the conditions : @xmath24 , where @xmath25 denotes the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the @xmath1-field .",
    "the contributions of matter and @xmath0 are proportional to the traces of their respective energy - momentum tensors . since the energy - momentum tensor of the electromagnetic field is traceless , a contribution of the form @xmath26 accounts for the coupling with it .",
    "the fit of our model to the data ( see below ) shows that @xmath27 , as it can be expected near the vacuum at low temperature .",
    "thus , we will not take the latter term into account .",
    "however , we may suspect that @xmath28 at high temperature , which may have consequences in some astrophysical conditions ( see below ) .    applying the least action principle to the action ( [ kk action and psi j - f frame ] ) yields :    * the generalized einstein equations @xmath29,\\ ] ] where @xmath30 @xmath31 and @xmath32\\ ] ] * the generalized maxwell equations @xmath33 and @xmath34 * and the scalar fields equations @xmath35 and @xmath36 + where the symbol @xmath37 stands for the riemannian covariant derivative .",
    "clearly , @xmath38 and @xmath39 define respectively an effective energy - momentum tensor for the electromagnetic field in the presence of the kk scalar field and an effective energy - momentum tensor for the latter itself .",
    "relations ( [ einstein eq]-[2nd group maxwell eq ] ) are formally the same as the einstein - maxwell ones , but with the additional contribution of the kk scalar as a matter source and the replacement of @xmath4 and @xmath40 by their respective effective values .",
    "since we are in weak field conditions ( we look for small deviations from newtonian physics ) , we only keep first order terms .",
    "thus , we neglect the excitations of @xmath0 and @xmath1 with respect to their respective vev s 1 and @xmath25 .",
    "also , the energy density of the @xmath1-field must be lower than that of the magnetic field .",
    "+ let us study the _ spatial _ variation of @xmath1 out of the fields source , but in presence of a static dipolar magnetic field , @xmath41 .",
    "we denote @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 respectively the radius from the centre , the azimuth angle and the colatitude .",
    "thus , writing @xmath45 and @xmath46 , and taking into account that @xmath47 ( definition of the vev ) , equations ( [ ext .",
    "scalar field eq ] ) and ( [ kk scalar eq ] ) simplify respectively as @xmath48 = 2 \\,\\frac{\\partial f_{em}}{\\partial \\psi}\\,(v\\,,\\,1)\\,v \\,\\frac{b^{2}}{{\\mu}_{0}}\\ ] ] and @xmath49 = - \\,2 \\,\\frac{\\partial f_{em}}{\\partial \\phi}\\,(v\\,,\\,1)\\,v \\,\\frac{b^{2}}{{\\mu}_{0}},\\ ] ] where we have dropped the pure gravitational constant @xmath50 with respect to @xmath51 , as indicated above .",
    "we consider a dipolar magnetic field : @xmath52 . for our purpose ,",
    "it is sufficient to limit the expansion of the scalar potential , @xmath53 , to the terms of the legendre function of degree one ( @xmath54 ) and order one ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "hence @xmath56 $ ] , where @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the relevant gauss coefficients , @xmath60 is the earth s radius and @xmath61 denotes its magnetic moment ( see @xcite ) . setting @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , the solutions of equation ( [ stabilized kk scalar eq stat .",
    "1st approx ] ) then reads @xmath65 where we have set @xmath66 and @xmath67 @xmath68 and similarly for @xmath1 by making the substitution @xmath69 in relation ( [ def .",
    "radial function k ] ) .",
    "thence , one derives the expression of @xmath70 by inserting the solution ( [ stabilized kk scalar sol .",
    "1st approx ] ) above in relation ( [ g eff ] ) .",
    "thus , since @xmath71 and the variable @xmath72 turns out to be positive at any position in space , it follows that the effective gravitational constant @xmath5 will always be greater than the true gravitational constant , @xmath4 .",
    "whence the prediction of an upward bias in the laboratory measurements of g.",
    "because of various uncontrolled systematic errors , the data published by the different laboratories have different precisions . in the following , we test two hypotheses with respect to these results : h0 = hypothesis of a constant g ( @xmath73 ) and h1 = hypothesis of an effective g ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "here @xmath75 denotes the number of degrees of freedom , @xmath76 is the number of data points , and we have 1 or 2 parameters in the fit .",
    "there are presently almost 45 results of measurements g published since 1942 ( see _ e.g. _ , @xcite , table 2 , pp . 168 and 169 ) .",
    "we exclude from the present study the mine measurements because of the too numerous uncontrolled systematic biases involved .",
    "the `` accepted ''",
    "values are presently @xmath77 ( codata 86 , @xcite ) and @xmath78 ( codata 2000 , @xcite ) in mks unit .",
    "a fitting of the 45 data with these values give respectively @xmath79 and @xmath80 ( @xmath81 , where @xmath75 denotes the degrees of freedom ) .",
    "if we forget the accepted value and try a best fit , assuming an arbitrary constant value of @xmath4 , we obtain @xmath82 si with @xmath83 .",
    "the more discordant laboratory measurement ( high ptb value @xcite ) is controversial . if we discard it , the previous fits lead to @xmath84 ( codata 86 ) , @xmath85 ( codata 2000 ) and @xmath86 ( free value ) .",
    "since it seems now certain that this high ptb value @xcite suffers from some systematic error ( see @xcite , for more details ) , we remove it for our analysis ( if we keep it , our model is still more favored ) .",
    "note that the strongest contributions to the @xmath87 then come from the bipm 2001 @xcite and the hust @xcite measurements . thus , unless there are some experimental systematic errors presently not understood , these experiments do not measure the same quantity . in the framework of the theory proposed here , they measure @xmath5 .",
    "because of the ge coupling , @xmath5 should depend on the geomagnetic field at the laboratory position .",
    "first , we select a subset of results with a good precision and which does not suffer any significant systematic error : we include only those points with relative uncertainty @xmath88 .",
    "also , we demand a short measuring time ( @xmath89  s ) , to minimize the possible biases due to the time variations of the geomagnetic field . this gives the sample s1 , with 17 points , shown in figure 1 .",
    "we fit these data using the igrf 2000 gauss coefficients using the igrf 1965 gauss coefficients ( @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 in gauss ) .",
    "however , no significant changes to our conclusions were found . ]",
    "( @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 in gauss ) .",
    "we obtain ( figure 1 , table 2 ) @xmath96 in mks units , with @xmath97 .",
    "this gives @xmath98 that we retain as a _ true _ gravitational constant .",
    "the relative uncertainty is only 1 part in @xmath99 : the major part of the differences between the laboratory measurements was generated by the predicted variation of @xmath100 with the magnetic field .",
    "further , adjusting to the same set the mean value @xmath101 a m@xmath102 ( in the time interval spanning from @xmath103 to @xmath104 ) , it follows @xmath105 that we retain too .",
    "we observe also that the hust value ( the lowest most precise measured value of @xmath4 ) is perfectly fitted : it differs from other values because of the proximity of this laboratory to the equator .",
    "then , we fit the whole sample ( excluding the ptb value , as stated above ) .",
    "we obtain the set of the 44 measurements given in figure 2 : the best fit leads to @xmath106 in mks units .",
    "it gives @xmath107 , to be compared to @xmath108 for the best fit assuming a constant @xmath4 .",
    "these results are summarized in table 2 . in order to check the relevance of our result ( which involves two free parameters rather than one ) , we apply the f test ( fisher law ) .",
    "this yields @xmath109 , which indicates that , independently of the number of parameters , our fit is better with a significance level greater than @xmath110 @xcite .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      +   +   + table 2 : reduced @xmath111 for the two different hypothesis h0 ( hypothesis of a constant @xmath4 ) and h1 ( ( hypothesis of an effective g ) , and different samples s1 and whole ( except the high ptb value @xcite , see text ) .",
    "we have not taken into account the temporal variation of the geomagnetic field .",
    "all the data considered in this paper are averaged on time . nevertheless , for those which",
    "would not be averaged on time , one may expect small time variations of @xmath5 both with the sq and with the l field disturbances of the geomagnetic field .",
    "now , periodic variations of the gravitational `` constant '' with the lunar or diurnal period have yet been pointed out in the literature ( see @xcite ) .",
    "although it is presently believed that they are related to tides , the explanation could be this temporal variation .",
    "we notice that the g measurements of @xcite are consistent with an annual variation .",
    "besides , a recent study @xcite shows that _ helioseismology _ seems to favor a low value of @xmath4 , close to the hust value .",
    "this is in accordance with our predictions ( see section 3 and relations ( [ 1/glab vs x ] ) and ( [ g laboratory data ] ) ) , since one expects the effective coupling of the @xmath0-field to the em field to decrease towards its lowest value as the temperature increases .",
    "hence , one gets a good agreement between our prediction ( [ g laboratory data ] ) and the helioseismic data , on account of the high temperature met in the core of the sun .    to test our proposal of a spatial dependence of @xmath5",
    ", we call for a complete covering of the earth ( in particular in the south hemisphere ) and at different latitudes . on the basis the current available data , the present study allows to make some predictions .",
    "first , according to the authors @xcite , the sudbury neutrino observatory ( sno : @xmath112",
    "29 n and @xmath113 59 o ) @xcite should constitute a promising means of determining g with a quite good accuracy .",
    "hence , since the measured quantity is actually the effective gravitational constant , the value predicted at sno by the relation ( [ 1/glab vs x ] ) is @xmath114 m@xmath115 kg@xmath116 s@xmath117 , that is practically the same as at the msl @xcite .",
    "in addition , it would be of interest to test also our predicted value at the surface of the poles , that is : @xmath118 in mks units . at the equator",
    ", one should get a dependence with respect to the longitude ( since the magnetic and geographic poles do not coincide ) .    at the orbit of the moon , the relative deviation , @xmath119 , to the true gravitational constant",
    "is predicted to be as small as @xmath120 which is consistent with lunar laser ranging ( see , @xcite ) . in the solar system ,",
    "the relevant magnetic field is the dipolar field of the quiet sun .",
    "since the coupling constant of the @xmath0-field to the em field is much weaker within the sun than on earth , one finds at the orbital radius of mercury @xmath121 and much smaller beyond , decreasing as @xmath122 .",
    "thus , at the orbital radius of neptune @xmath119 drops to less than @xmath123 . taking into account the overall planetary constraints on @xmath124 @xcite , the accord between the proposed model and observation is still acceptable .    for artificial satellites in quasi - circular orbits ,",
    "the appropriate quantity for comparison with observational data is @xmath125 when the analysis is based only on the satellite data ( see appendices a and b ) , where we have set @xmath126 $ ] and @xmath127 is the true earth quadrupole moment coefficient . referring to the orbital motion of the lageos satellite , with semimajor axis equal to @xmath128 km , inclination @xmath129 and eccentricity @xmath130 , one finds the maximum deviations @xmath131 ( whereas @xmath132 ) , consistent with the constraint @xmath133 on the yukawa coupling constant @xmath9 ( see @xcite , figure 3.2a , p. 99 and",
    "section 6.7 ) .",
    "+ we also looked for a possible relative deviation to the true gravitational constant induced by the strong magnetic fields of _",
    "pulsars_. we found this effect quite negligible , of the order @xmath134 in the case of the binary pulsar psr@xmath10 , for which observation yields @xmath135 @xcite .",
    "the deviation is tiny because of the small radius of the pulsar and of its companion as compared to their respective orbital radius around the center of mass .",
    "thus we conclude that , apart from systematic errors that need to be corrected ( _ e.g. _ , by applying some prescriptions like that pointed out by kuroda @xcite for the swinging pendulum method ) , the only possibility to reconcile the published values of @xmath4 is to consider a dependence on the latitude and longitude , of the type proposed here .",
    "in particular , if all present systematic errors could be removed in the future , we predict @xmath136 m@xmath115 kg@xmath116 at the ptb laboratory , that is the same value as that predicted at sno and the current msl .    up to now",
    ", a lot of attention had been paid to the dependence of @xmath4 on cosmic time or radial distance only .",
    "but the dependence on latitude and longitude , that we examine here , has not been taken into account .",
    "more precise measurements ( _ e.g. _ , the see project @xcite ) and further analyses taking into account higher harmonics and the various kind of changes of the geomagnetic field should bring more support to our claim .",
    "the generalized einstein equations ( [ einstein eq ] ) rewrite ( including the contribution of the ordinary matter , @xmath137 ) @xmath138 @xmath139.\\ ] ] now in the weak fields and slow motion approximation , only the @xmath140 components are relevant .",
    "hence , the above equations reduce to @xmath141.\\ ] ] the first term of the right hand side of the above equation is second order . hence , neglecting the energy densities of the em field and the @xmath1-field with respect to the ( ordinary ) matter density , one gets @xmath142 clearly , this yields the newtonian potential divided by @xmath0 , that is an effective potential where @xmath143 is replaced by @xmath144 .",
    "as a consequence , the equation of motion of a satellite should be sensitive to the effect of the effective g if present . indeed , in the static gravitational field of a rotating body of mass @xmath145 with angular velocity @xmath146 and for @xmath147 or more , one may merely replace in the first approximation @xmath143 by @xmath5 in the newtonian potential .",
    "thus , @xmath148 , where @xmath149 , @xmath150 and @xmath151 \\,- \\,{\\omega}^{2 } \\,r \\ , ( \\,1 \\,- \\,cos^{2}{\\theta } \\,).\\ ] ] hence , inserting relations ( [ stabilized kk scalar sol .",

    "the quadratic cosine term provides an additional term to the effective zonal harmonic coefficient of order @xmath156 .",
    "clearly , by interpreting the data from a single satellite in circular orbit , @xmath157 will appears as a constant parameter .",
