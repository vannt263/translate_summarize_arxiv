    "since its development in the late 1930s , the phenomenological model of nucleation and growth of kolmogorov , johnson - mehl , and avrami ( kjma ) has been widely applied to the analysis of kinetics of first - order phase transformations , mostly in two and three spatial dimensions  @xcite .",
    "the model has several exact results given the following basic assumptions : ( 1 ) the system is infinitely large and untransformed at time @xmath2=0 ; ( 2 ) nucleations occur stochastically , homogeneously , and independently one from one another ; ( 3 ) the transformed domains grow outward uniformly , keeping their shape ; and ( 4 ) growing domains that impinge coalesce .",
    "although the kjma model is conceptually simple , experiments often have complicating factors that make the contact between theory and experiment delicate and lead to deviations from the basic model . for example , a principal result of the kjma model is that the fraction @xmath3 of the transformed volume at time @xmath2 is @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are constants : @xmath5 depends upon the growth velocity @xmath1 , the nucleation rate @xmath7 , and the spatial dimension @xmath8 , while @xmath6 is determined by @xmath7 and @xmath8 . in the literature , @xmath6 is called the avrami exponent .  avrami plots \" of @xmath9 $ ] vs. @xmath10 should thus be straight lines of slope @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , eq .  [ eq : f ] often does not fit data well because the experimental conditions do not satisfy the assumptions of the kjma theory  @xcite .",
    "for example , nucleation can be inhomogeneous or correlated  @xcite ; real systems are finite ; and there is always measurement noise .    in two- or three - dimensional systems , where only limited theoretical results such as eq .",
    "[ eq : f ] are available , it can be difficult to pinpoint the origins of discrepancies between experimental data and the predictions of the kjma model . in one - dimensional systems ,",
    "however , several scientists have shown since the 1980s that one can push the analysis much further than for the original version of the kjma model  @xcite .    in this paper , we shall show that a detailed theoretical understanding of the kjma model in 1d lets us compare theory and experiment more directly .",
    "in other words , we can extract the kinetic parameters from data under less - than - ideal experimental circumstances .",
    "our discussion will be set in the context of recent dna - replication experiments that have drawn attention from both the physics and biology communities  @xcite .",
    "although there are many analytical results for the 1d - kjma model , only a very few 1d systems that are well - described this model have been identified ( e.g.  @xcite ) , and very little detailed analysis has been done on those systems . recently ,",
    "however , herrick _ et al . _ have identified a formal analogy between the 1d - kjma model and dna replication processes  @xcite . equally important , they have developed experimental methods that can yield large quantities of data , allowing the extraction of detailed statistical quantities . since the dna work provides a model system for testing the general experimental problems discussed above , and also in order to fix the language , we begin by reviewing the mapping between dna replication and the kjma model .",
    "although the organization of the genome for dna replication varies considerably from species to species , the duplication of most eukaryotic genomes shares a number of common features  @xcite :    1 .",
    "dna replication starts at a large number of sites known as  origins of replication . \"",
    "the dna domain replicated from each origin is referred to , informally , as an  eye \" or a  replication bubble \" because of its appearance in electron microscopy .",
    "the position of each potential origin that is  competent \" to initiate dna replication is determined before the beginning of the synthesis part of the cell cycle (  s phase \" ) , when several proteins , including the origin recognition complex ( orc ) bind to dna , forming a pre - replication complex ( pre - rc ) .",
    "3 .   during s phase , a particular potential origin may or may not be activated .",
    "each origin is activated not more than once during the cell - division cycle . 4 .",
    "dna synthesis propagates at replication forks bidirectionally , with propagation speed or fork velocity @xmath1 , from each activated origin .",
    "experimentally , @xmath1 is approximately constant throughout s phase .",
    "dna synthesis stops when two newly replicated regions of dna meet .        from fig .",
    "[ fig : mapping ] , it is apparent that processes 35 have a formal analogy with nucleation and growth in one dimension .",
    "we identify ( 1 ) nucleation of islands as activation ( initiation ) of replication origins ; ( 2 ) growth of the eyes as growth of the islands ; and ( 3 ) coalescence of two expanding eyes as the merging of growing islands .",
    "of course , while dna is topologically one dimensional , it is embodied in a three - dimensional space .    in an ideal world , one could monitor the replication process continuously and compile domain statistics in real time . in the real world , the three billion dna basepairs ( bps ) of a typical higher eukaryote , which replicate in as many as @xmath11@xmath12 sites simultaneously , are packed in a cell nucleus of radius @xmath111 @xmath13 , making a direct , real - time monitoring impossible  @xcite .",
    "recently , experiments have used two - color fluorescent labeling of dna bases to study replication kinetics indirectly  @xcite .",
    "one begins ( in a test tube ) by labeling the bases used in replicating the dna with , say , a red dye . at some time during the replication process ( e.g. @xmath14 in fig .",
    "[ fig : mapping ] ) , one floods the test tube with green - labeled bases and allows the replication cycle to go to completion .",
    "one then stretches the dna onto a glass slide (  molecular combing \"  @xcite ) , a process that unfortunately also breaks the dna strands into finite segments . under a microscope , regions that replicated before adding the dye are red , while those labeled afterwards are predominantly green .",
    "the alternating red - and - green regions correspond to eyes and holes in fig .",
    "[ fig : mapping ] , forming a kind of snapshot of the replication state of the dna fragment at the time the second dye was added . each time point in fig .",
    "[ fig : mapping ] would thus correspond to a separate experiment .    using the formal analogy between dna replication and 1d nucleation - growth model",
    ", we can extract the kinetic parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 from data  @xcite .",
    "for the ideal case , the procedure is straightforward . for real - world data , on the other hand",
    ", one has to be cautious because of the generic problems explained above .",
    "we have already mentioned that the molecular combing process chops the dna into finite - size segments , which effectively truncates the full statistics  @xcite .",
    "another problem in the experimental protocols is that an in - vitro replication experiment usually has many different nuclei in the test tube .",
    "these nuclei start replication at different , unknown times and locations along the genome  @xcite .",
    "the asynchrony leads to sample heterogeneity and creates a starting - time distribution for the dna replication  @xcite .",
    "finally , the finite resolution of the microscope used to measure domain sizes may affect the statistics .",
    "below , we shall examine each of these complicating factors , present empirical criteria for their significance , and then discuss the implications of these criteria for the design of experiments .    to set the stage ,",
    "we begin with the problem of extracting experimental parameters from ideal data .      from the theoretician s point of view",
    ", a system can be said to be ideal when it satisfies all underlying assumptions of the theory . in the context of dna replication and the kjma model ,",
    "this means that the dna molecule is infinitely long and that the initiation rate @xmath7 of replication is homogeneous and uncorrelated .",
    "also , statistics should be directly obtainable at any time point @xmath2 at arbitrarily fine resolution .",
    "because the growth velocity of replicated dna domains has been measured to be approximately constant , we shall limit our analysis to this special case .",
    "one can then apply the kjma model to a single experimental realization to extract kinetic parameters such as @xmath0 and @xmath1 .    in order to do this , we note that the simulation in our previous paper  @xcite ( hereafter , paper i ) is in practice such a case ( system size = @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , where @xmath19 ) . using the theoretical results obtained in paper i , we can find an expression to invert @xmath0 from data .",
    "for example , the domain density @xmath20 and the island fraction @xmath3 at time @xmath2 , given a time - dependent nucleation rate @xmath0 are  @xcite @xmath21    in eq .",
    "[ eq : ns ] , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is the hole fraction .",
    "note that @xmath24 is equal to the average island - to - island distance @xmath25 at time @xmath2 . on the other hand , the average hole size",
    "@xmath26 is @xmath27 .",
    "since all three domains ( island , hole , and island - to - island ) have equal densities @xmath20 in one dimension , we have the following general relationship among them , which is valid even in the presence of correlations between domain sizes :    @xmath28    in other words , there are only two independent quantities among @xmath29 , and we can calculate @xmath30 even if we do not know the exact expression for the island distribution @xmath31 : @xmath32\\nonumber\\\\ \\bar{\\ell}_h(t ) & = & \\frac{1}{g(t)}\\\\ \\bar{\\ell}_{i2i}(t ) & = & \\frac{1}{g(t)}e^{2v\\int_0^t{g(t')}dt'}.\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    note that @xmath30 [ @xmath26 ] is a monotonically increasing ( decreasing ) function of time , and therefore , eq .",
    "[ eq : mean - field_a ] implies that @xmath25 has a well - defined minimum .",
    "we emphasize that eqs .",
    "[ eq : ns ] and  [ eq : mean_q ] set the basic time and length scales , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , of the system .",
    "because the kjma model has essentially only one scale , it is simpler than other common stochastic models in physics that lack an intrinsic scale and hence show fractal behavior ( structure at all scales ) .",
    "since @xmath3 is sigmoidal , varying from 0 to 1 , we define @xmath34 to be the time required for the system to reach @xmath36 . on the other hand , we define @xmath35 to be the minimum eye - to - eye ( island - to - island ) distance during the course of replication [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : basic](c ) and ( d ) ] .    from eqs .",
    "[ eq : ns ] and  [ eq : mean_q ] , it is straightfoward to invert the mean quantities to obtain the nucleation rate @xmath0 and the growth velocity @xmath1 : @xmath37    eq .  [ eq : inversion1 ] can then be applied to an ideal set of data , i.e. , one for which noise - free measurements are made on infinitely long dna . as fig .",
    "[ fig : basic ] shows , we can recover the input parameters from simulation results in paper i accurately : the extracted parameters are @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "[ the errors are the statistical errors from the curve fits in figs .",

    "we note that the fluctuations visible for @xmath40 arise from using direct numerical differentiation in eq .",
    "[ eq : inversion1 ] .",
    "one could reduce the noise by appropriate data processing , using for example a smoothing spline  @xcite .",
    "however , because any data filtering is a delicate issue , and because direct numerical differentiation produced satisfactory results , we have decided to forego any smoothing .",
    "we also note that there are statistical fluctuations related to the finite - size of the system : as @xmath3 approaches 1 , the number of domains @xmath20 becomes very small ; thus even small changes in @xmath20 can cause significant fluctuations in average domain sizes .",
    "however , the finite - size effect in this case becomes visible only when the number of new nucleations in each step , @xmath41 , is roughly 1 ( @xmath42 or @xmath43 ) . the effect can be ignored for @xmath44 for the practically infinite system considered here  @xcite .    in the following sections",

    ", @xmath35 is the minimum average eye - to - to spacing , and sets the basic length scale . in ( d ) , @xmath34 is the time at which 50@xmath45 of the genome has replicated .",
    "it sets the basic time scale.,width=326 ]          as we mentioned above , data often come from experiments where the dna from many different independently replicating cells is simultaneously present in the same test tube .",
    "the individual dna molecules begin replicating at different unknown starting times . in such cases , it is simpler to begin by sorting data by the replicated fraction @xmath46 of the measured segment  @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is that for spatially homogeneous replication ( namely , nucleation and growth ) , all segments with a similar fraction @xmath46 are at roughly the same point in s phase .",
    "since @xmath3 is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath2 , we can essentially use @xmath46 as our initial clock , leaving the conversion to real time @xmath2 to a second step .",
