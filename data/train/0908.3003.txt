    "the evolution of galaxies in clusters since @xmath14 is expected to reflect both changes in the raw ingredients , i.e.  the properties of galaxies that have fallen into clusters from the field in this time , and the physical processes that have acted on those galaxies after infall .",
    "early evidence for cluster galaxy evolution was presented by ( * ? ? ?",

    "* hereafter bo84 ) , who found that the fraction of cluster members bluer than the cluster red sequence ( @xmath15 ) , by at least @xmath16mag in the @xmath17 rest frame , increases from zero in the local universe to @xmath18 by @xmath19 implying a rapid evolution of the cluster population over the last 5 billion years .",
    "empirically the star - forming spiral galaxies found by bo84 at @xmath20 are mostly replaced by s0 galaxies in local clusters @xcite .",
    "a simple interpretation is that clusters accreted blue gas - rich star - forming spirals at @xmath21 and that these galaxies have been transformed somehow into the passive s0s found in local clusters , by having their gas reservoirs depleted by one or more physical processes within clusters , including for example ram - pressure stripping , starvation or harassment ( for reviews see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , more recent studies of the so called butcher - oemler ( bo ) effect and the evolution of the morphology - density relation have suggested that at least some of the observed evolution in @xmath22 is due to selection biases .",
    "firstly , bo84 selected galaxies on optical luminosity ( @xmath23 ) rather than stellar mass ( or @xmath24 ) , and were therefore susceptible to biases arising from low - mass spiral galaxies  the optical luminosities of such galaxies are boosted by starburst activity , and thus they increasingly enter the samples at higher redshifts @xcite . similarly , the use of a fixed @xmath25 and @xmath23 for blue galaxy selection fails to take account of the youth ( and thus brightness and blue - ness ) of stellar populations in galaxies at higher redshifts relative to their lower redshift counterparts . to counter this effect , @xcite and @xcite",
    "have advocated the use of differential @xmath26-corrections to associate blue galaxies with the same spectral classes of galaxies at all redshifts , and to take into account the expected luminosity evolution of galaxies when defining the @xmath23 ( or better still @xmath24 ) limits .",
    "the above studies all conclude that once these selection biases have been eliminated the redshift evolution of @xmath22 is significantly reduced , suggesting that there has been little evolution in the cluster galaxy population since @xmath27 .",
    "similarly , when using mass - selected samples ( @xmath28 ) @xcite and @xcite find that the morphological composition of clusters and the morphology - density relation has remained largely unchanged since @xmath29 , as opposed to luminosity - selected ( @xmath30 ) samples where significant redshift evolution is seen @xcite .",
    "another more subtle bias arises from the selection of the clusters themselves .",
    "bo84 s cluster sample was a heterogeneous mixture of clusters identified from photographic plates or by their association with radio galaxies , and hence favored the inclusion of more extreme clusters at high - redshifts , in particular those with higher blue fractions as they would be easier to detect and identify .",
    "indeed @xcite and @xcite showed that the high - redshift clusters of the bo84 sample are much more x - ray luminous and have higher velocity - dispersions and central surface densities than their low - redshift counterparts , suggesting that these selection biases could mimic evolutionary effects , and illustrating the need for well - defined samples of clusters spanning a large redshift range .",
    "more recent studies of x - ray selected clusters again find that both the scatter in the blue galaxy fraction and the trend with redshift is much reduced @xcite relative to those measured from optically - selected cluster samples ( bo84 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these latter samples contain a large number of poor clusters , and although the influence of x - ray luminosity ( @xmath31 ) , velocity dispersion ( @xmath32 ) or cluster richness on @xmath22 is still much debated @xcite , there seems a general consensus that for massive ( @xmath33 ) , x - ray luminous clusters there is little scatter or evolution in @xmath22 out to @xmath29 @xcite .    finally , the scatter in the blue galaxy fraction among the intermediate - redshift ( @xmath34 ) clusters is large ; values for individual clusters lying in the range @xmath35 , i.e.  values typical of clusters at @xmath36 and @xmath37 respectively .",
    "this has often been broadly attributed to the dynamical status of the clusters , with actively merging clusters showing higher fractions of blue or star - forming galaxies than those apparently relaxed @xcite . however , equally this could be due to field galaxy contamination , as the blue galaxy fractions are estimated by statistically subtracting foreground and background objects by comparison to control fields , a process that becomes increasingly uncertain at higher redshifts as the level of field contamination rises",
    ". however , in an analysis based on only spectroscopically confirmed members of 60 clusters at @xmath38 covered by the 2dfgrs , @xcite obtained a similarly large scatter in the blue galaxy fraction , including some clusters with @xmath39 , and also found no correlations between @xmath22 and other cluster properties including richness , substructure , concentration .",
    "the sensitivity of _ iso _ and more recently _ spitzer _ at mid - infrared ( mir ) wavelengths has opened up a new window for studying star - formation in galaxy clusters",
    ". the most straightforward interpretation @xcite of the 24@xmath40 emission is that it traces the dust obscured star - formation , while the observed uv or h@xmath41 emission traces the unobscured one @xcite .",
    "mir observations of clusters have revealed a population of dusty star - forming cluster galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "indeed , these mir - detected star forming galaxies often have optical colors consistent with the passively evolving early - type cluster galaxies @xcite and would therefore be missed by the traditional bo studies .",
    "@xcite therefore combined the dusty star - forming cluster members , defined here as having mid - infrared star - formation rates higher than @xmath42 , with the traditionally selected blue cluster members  all found within @xmath43 of the cluster centers  to show that the optical and ir populations contribute roughly equally to the observed bo effect out to @xmath44 .",
    "however several studies have shown that the dusty galaxies contribute significantly more to the integrated cluster star formation rate than the optically selected blue galaxies .",
    "for example star formation rates derived from the [ oii ] emission line are typically @xmath45 lower than rates estimated from ir luminosities ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , these previous studies have analyzed either single clusters or at most a handful of heterogeneously selected clusters over a large redshift range , with 12 clusters per redshift slice , such that no statistical analysis of trends with cluster properties or redshift has yet been done in the mir .    in this article",
    "we revisit the bo effect , taking advantage of recently obtained panoramic _ spitzer _",
    "mir and ground - based nir imaging of 22 clusters at @xmath46 from the local cluster substructure survey ( locuss ; http://www.sr.bham.ac.uk/locuss ; see also  [ sec : locuss ] for more details ) plus comparable data for coma and abell 1367 at @xmath47 , five clusters from the shapley supercluster at @xmath48 covered by access ( a complete census of star - formation and nuclear activity in the shapley supercluster ) , and cl0024 + 17 at @xmath49 .",
    "in contrast to the only previous mir bo study @xcite , our large sample of 30 clusters in total allows us to measure the scatter in the @xmath13redshift relation as a function of redshift , and to explore the relationship between the scatter and simple indicators of the dynamical state of the clusters .",

    "the overall aim is to constrain the cluster - to - cluster scatter in the observable properties ( e.g.  x - ray temperature , integrated sz - effect @xmath54-parameter , star - formation rate , far - infrared galaxy luminosity function ) of massive clusters at low redshift , and to interpret these observables in the context of hierarchical assembly , aided by gravitational lensing probes of the distribution of dark matter in the clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these analyses will , for example , deliver new constraints both on the normalization , shape and scatter of mass - observable scaling relations required for precision cluster cosmology , and on the evolutionary pathways of gas - rich field galaxies into passive cluster early - type galaxies .",
    "early results on these two complementary aspects of the survey can be found in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .    the first batch of 30 clusters in our survey benefits from a particularly rich dataset , including : subaru / suprime - cam optical imaging @xcite , _ spitzer_/mips @xmath1 maps , galex near- and far - ultraviolet ( nuv / fuv ) imaging , and near - infrared ( nir ; @xmath55 ) imaging from ukirt / wfcam and kpno-4m / newfirm .",

    "[ cm ] by the @xmath1-detected cluster members ( green symbols ) showing the same @xmath79 colors as those cluster members not detected at @xmath1 , albeit with more scatter .",
    "indeed the @xmath1 sources often lie well above the sequence , presumably reddened by dust , necessitating the use of a selection box that is asymmetric around the `` red sequence '' of cluster members .",

    "however there remains significant contamination by background galaxies in the range @xmath88 ( open magenta symbols ) , driven partly by the red envelope of our color - magnitude selection function in an attempt to minimize the loss of heavily reddened cluster members ( see upper sloping line in each panel of fig .",
    "we correct statistically for this contamination , using galaxy counts satisfying the same color - magnitude selection in two control fields .",

    "for example , @xcite showed that the specific uv+ir - determined sfr has declined by a factor @xmath159 since @xmath173 , independent of galaxy mass , while the specific sfrs of local galaxies are @xmath174 lower than those of @xmath175 galaxies of the same mass .",

    "studies of the mir lfs of nearby clusters find the shape and @xmath182 to be consistent with that of field galaxies , while the evolution with redshift to @xmath163 of @xmath183 is also indistinguishable from the field @xcite .",
    "similarly , @xcite find that the h@xmath41 luminosities of individual cluster galaxies have declined by a factor of up to @xmath159 since @xmath184 , comparable to that of field galaxies over a similar redshift interval .    to quantify the excess evolution of @xmath13 over the global evolution of star formation we therefore repeat the analysis in  [ sec : bo ] , this time allowing the luminosity threshold above which galaxies are counted in the numerator of @xmath13 to scale with redshift as follows : @xmath185^k$ ] , with @xmath186 chosen to be representative of the results discussed above , and @xmath187 , corresponding to the highest cluster redshift to which we fit the redshift evolution model .",

    "@xcite show that although the accretion rate of galaxies into massive clusters has remained constant since @xmath173 , half of the cluster galaxy population has been accreted since @xmath192 , and so the _ fraction _ of recently accreted galaxies should appear to double from @xmath165 to @xmath192 .",
    "this suggests that the `` residual '' redshift evolution seen in fig .",
    "[ bo_evol ] , albeit at modest statistical significance , is attributable to the fate of galaxies after they have fallen into clusters .",
    "galaxy populations that have recently fallen into clusters are most easily identified in photometric observational data at large cluster centric radii , thus overcoming the projection of the three - dimensional distribution of galaxies onto the sky . to gain a rough idea of the location of the galaxies responsible for the redshift evolution seen in fig .",
    "[ bo_evol ] we modify further the selection function , this time restricting the range of cluster - centric radii to @xmath193 , again using the `` differential @xmath26-correction '' approach to @xmath99 selection . the results of this modified selection are shown in fig .",

    "we also fit a model with just a single parameter  a redshift - invariant value of @xmath13  obtaining @xmath195 with a reduced chi - squared value of @xmath196 , confirming that the scatter of the data around this value can be explained simply by the observational uncertainties , without recourse to either intrinsic cluster - to - cluster scatter or redshift evolution .    in summary",
    "these results are consistent with the global decline in ir activity in field galaxies since @xmath197 . as",
    "field galaxies fall into clusters some of them suffer an increase in ir activity at @xmath198 , presumably due to star formation induced by gentle processes in their local environment at large radii .",

    "no single measure exists in the literature that unambiguously identifies a cluster as being `` disturbed '' , i.e.undergoing a merger .",
    "nevertheless , several measures do appear to correlate with cluster dynamical status , such as the presence or absence of a cool core in the x - ray temperature profile , the cuspiness of the density profile , or the offset of the brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) from the peak of x - ray emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the main caveat to this picture is that the observed trends in @xmath13 appear to lie systematically above the predictions from the simple infall model for all redshift bins over @xmath222 .",

    "<S> we study the mid - infrared properties of galaxies in 30 massive galaxy clusters at @xmath0 , using panoramic _ spitzer_/mips @xmath1 and near - infrared data , including 27 new observations from the locuss and access surveys . </S>",
    "<S> this is the largest sample of clusters to date with such high - quality and uniform mid - infrared data covering not only the cluster cores , but extending into the infall regions . </S>",
    "<S> we use these data to revisit the so - called butcher - oemler effect , measuring the fraction of massive infrared luminous galaxies ( , @xmath2 ) within @xmath3 , finding a steady increase in the fraction with redshift from @xmath4 at @xmath5 to @xmath6 by @xmath7 , and an rms cluster - to - cluster scatter about this trend of 0.03 . </S>",
    "<S> the best - fit redshift evolution model of the form @xmath8 has @xmath9 , which is stronger redshift evolution than that of @xmath10 in both clusters and the field . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , statistically , this excess is associated with galaxies found at large cluster - centric radii , specifically @xmath11 , implying that the mid - infrared butcher oemler effect can be explained by a combination of both the global decline in star - formation in the universe since @xmath12 and enhanced star formation in the infall regions of clusters at intermediate redshifts . </S>",
    "<S> this picture is supported by a simple infall model based on the millennium simulation semi - analytic galaxy catalogs , whereby star - formation in infalling galaxies is instantaneously quenched upon their first passage through the cluster , in that the observed radial trends of @xmath13 trace those inferred from the simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the observed @xmath13 however lie systematically above the predictions , suggesting an overall excess of star - formation , either due to triggering by environmental processes , or a gradual quenching . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that @xmath13 does not depend on simple indicators of the dynamical state of clusters , including the offset between the brightest cluster galaxy and the peak of the x - ray emission . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the picture described above in that most new star - formation in clusters occurs in the infall regions , and is thus not sensitive to the details of cluster - cluster mergers in the core regions . </S>"
