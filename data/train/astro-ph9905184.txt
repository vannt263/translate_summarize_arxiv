    "grs 1741.9@xmath02853 was discovered during the first observations of the galactic centre region performed by the _",

    "the source was detected by the low - energy ( 430 kev ) imaging telescope art - p in the march  24april  8 observations and was tentatively associated ( @xcite ) to the soft _ einstein _ source 1e 1741.7@xmath02850 ( @xcite ) .",

    "the possible association with 1e 1741.7@xmath02850 and also with the nearby _ ginga _ transient gs 1741.2@xmath02859/1741.6@xmath0289 ( @xcite ) was ruled out .",
    "the average 420 kev intensity of grs 1741.9@xmath02853 was @xmath6 mcrab , corresponding to @xmath7 at 8.5 kpc , and the source spectrum could be fitted by a thermal bremsstrahlung with a temperature of @xmath8 kev . during the same _",
    "granat _ observations , grs 1741.9@xmath02853 was detected above the @xmath9 detection level of the soft gamma - ray telescope sigma in the 40100 kev band ( @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , both art - p and sigma did not detect the source @xmath10 months later during the fall 1990 observation campaign , suggesting grs 1741.9@xmath02853 is transient in nature .",
    "a @xmath11 upper limit of 1.2 mcrab was obtained by art - p in the 420 kev band ( @xcite ) , thus implying a drop in the source intensity of at least a factor of 7 .",
    "moreover , _ granat _ failed to detect grs 1741.9@xmath02853 in all the subsequent campaigns on the galactic centre ( spring 1991 , fall 1991 , spring 1992 , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the source was not observed in detailed mappings of the galactic centre region by soft x - ray instruments like _ einstein _ ( 0.54.5 kev , @xmath11 upper limit of @xmath12 mcrab , see @xcite ) , _ spacelab-2 _",
    "( 330 kev , @xmath13 mcrab , @xcite ) , and by _ rosat _ ( 0.82.5 kev , @xmath14 mcrab , @xcite ) , thus confirming its transient nature .",

    "one of the main scientific objectives of the wide field cameras ( wfc ) on board the _ bepposax _ satellite is the study of the timing / spectral behavior of both transient and persistent sources of the galactic bulge region , x - ray binaries in particular , on time scales from seconds to years . to this end ,",
    "an observation program of systematic monitoring of the sgr  a sky region is being carried out ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the wfcs consist of two identical coded mask telescopes ( @xcite ) pointing in opposite directions .",
    "each camera covers a @xmath36 field of view , the largest ever flown for an arcminute resolution x - ray imaging device . with their source location accuracy in the range @xmath37@xmath38 ( 99% confidence ) , a time resolution of 0.244 ms at best , and an energy resolution of 18% at 6 kev ,",
    "the wfcs are very effective in studying x - ray transient phenomena in the 228 kev bandpass .",
    "the imaging capability and the good instrument sensitivity ( 5 - 10 mcrab in @xmath39 s ) allow an accurate monitoring of complex sky regions , like the galactic bulge .",
    "the data of the two cameras are systematically searched for bursts and flares by analyzing the time profiles of the detectors in the 211 kev energy range with a time resolution down to 1 s. reconstructed sky images are generated for any statistically meaningful event , to identify possible bursters .",
    "the accuracy of the reconstructed position , which of course depends on the burst intensity , is typically better than @xmath40 .",

    "an accurate search for bursts from grs 1741.9@xmath02853 was performed on all the data available from the 1996 - 1998 _ bepposax_-wfc galactic bulge monitoring campaigns but no other events were observed .",

    "mentioned missing data in the august 22 burst observation , only the august 24 and september 16 bursts were analyzed this way ( see fig .",
    "the time histories of the bursts are constructed by accumulating only the detector counts associated with the shadowgram obtained for the sky position of the analyzed source , thus improving the signal to noise ratio of the profile .",
    "the background is the sum of ( part of ) the diffuse x - ray background , the particles background and the contamination of other sources in the field of view .",
    "source contamination is the dominating background component for crowded sky fields like the galactic bulge .",
    "nevertheless , the probability of source confusion during a short time - scale event ( 10100 s ) like an x - ray burst is negligible .",
    "the burst spectra of grs 1741.9@xmath02853 are consistent with absorbed blackbody radiation with average color temperatures of @xmath69 kev .",
    "a summary of the spectral parameters of the three bursts is given in table 1 .",
    "the value of the @xmath30 parameter obtained for the august 24 burst is higher with respect to the august 22 and september 16 ones . for burst 2 ,",
    "freezing the @xmath30 value to the average value of burst 1 and 3 ( @xmath70 ) leads to higher values of the reduced @xmath71 ( 1.30 for 27 d.o.f . ) , to an higher blackbody temperature ( @xmath72 kev ) and to a lower blackbody radius ( @xmath73 km at 10 kpc ) .",
    "conversely , if we assume that all the three bursts had in average the same characteristics ( color temperature and radius of the emitting sphere ) , this implies a 1-day time - scale @xmath30 variability of a factor of @xmath44 .",
    "time - resolved spectra were accumulated for burst 2 and 3 , in order to study the time evolution of their spectral parameters .",
    "to better constrain the fits , the @xmath30 parameter was kept fixed , according to the values obtained for the total bursts , i.e. @xmath74 and @xmath75 for burst 2 and burst 3 respectively .",
    "blackbody spectra allow to determine the relationship between the average radius of the emitting sphere @xmath76 ( in units of km ) and the source distance @xmath77 ( in units of 10 kpc ) . in fig . 3 and in table 2",
    "the time histories of the measured @xmath76/@xmath77 ratios are shown , assuming isotropic emission and not correcting for gravitational redshift and conversion to true blackbody temperature from color temperature ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "a radius expansion of a factor of @xmath69 is observed in the september 16 burst .",
    "on the basis of their spectral and timing properties , we interpret the three bursts detected from grs 1741.9@xmath02853 as type - i x - ray bursts , typically associated to low - mass binary ( lmxb ) systems ( see @xcite for a review ) . the blackbody emission and",
    "the measured color temperatures of @xmath69 kev are consistent with this hypothesis .",
    "spectral softening is observed in the time resolved spectra of the bursts ( table 2 ) .",
    "moreover , the bursts time profiles can be fitted with exponential decays whose characteristic times are energy dependent , being shorter at higher energies ( see fig .",
    "type - i bursts strongly suggest a neutron star nature for the binary system .",
    "this indicates grs 1741.9@xmath02853 is a transient neutron - star lmxb .",
    "the photospheric radius expansion derived from the time resolved spectral analysis of the brightest burst ( burst 3 ) can be interpreted as adiabatic expansion during an high luminosity ( super - eddington ) type - i burst . actually , the 728 kev time history of the september 16 burst ( fig .",
    "3 , right panel ) shows a top - flattened and perhaps double - peaked profile which is typical of super - eddington events ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "eddington - luminosity x - ray bursts can lead to an estimate of the source distance . assuming a @xmath78 eddington bolometric luminosity for a @xmath79 neutron star , and taking into account the observed peak flux of burst 3 which extrapolates to an unabsorbed bolometric luminosity of @xmath80 mcrab ( @xmath81 ) , we obtain @xmath82 kpc .",
    "if we adopt the average luminosity of super - eddington bursts proposed by lewin , van paradijs , & taam ( 1995 ) ( @xmath83 ) the distance value becomes @xmath84 kpc , indicating grs 1741.9@xmath02853 to be very close to the galactic centre .",
    "assuming a crab - like spectrum , for the source bolometric luminosity we derive an upper limit of @xmath85 during the bursting activity ( august - september 1996 ) .",
    "we also obtain an average radius of @xmath86 km for the blackbody emitting region during the bursts , a value supporting the neutron - star nature of the collapsed object .",
    "+ taking into account the intensity and the spectrum observed in the 1990 outburst ( @xcite ) , we can also derive a peak bolometric luminosity of @xmath87 , which extrapolates to an accretion rate of @xmath88 for a canonical @xmath79 neutron star .",
    "these values are common among low luminosity lmxb transients ( e.g. @xcite ) .    during the past two decades , bursting activity from lmxb transients has been reported in about 10 cases ( e.g. rapid burster , aql x-1 , cen x-4 , 0748@xmath0673 , 1658@xmath0298 , see @xcite , lewin et al .",
    "1995 , and references therein ) , thus indicating the sources to be neutron - star binaries . among the lmxb transients",
    "less than @xmath89 of sources ( @xmath90 , according to chen et al .",
    "1997 , @xmath91 , according to @xcite ) are neutron - star systems , the rest being black hole ( bh ) binaries .",
    "all the bh candidates in lmxb systems are transient sources .",
    "+ the recent ( 1996 - 1999 ) _ bepposax_-wfc results report on several observations of type - i x - ray bursts in transient sources ( e.g. sax j1750.8@xmath02900 , sax j1806.5@xmath02215 , sax j1753.5@xmath02349 , sax j1808.4@xmath03658 , rx j170930.2@xmath0263927 , sax j1810.8@xmath02609 , see @xcite ) .",
    "conversely , no firm lmxb bh candidate was established .",
    "this could imply the population of black hole lmxb to be overstimated , since most of them are suggested as bh candidates on the basis of their spectral characteristics only . actually , for only 7 out of about 40 known transient lmxb the available mass functions suggest bh systems ( @xcite ) .",
