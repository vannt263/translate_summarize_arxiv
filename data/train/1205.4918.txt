    "the spectrum of resonance fluorescence which is emitted by an ensemble of atoms and ions driven by an intense near - resonant electric field @xcite is one of the cornerstones of quantum optics @xcite .",
    "the spectrum is measured experimentally by exposing an atomic ensemble to intense light and detecting the scattered photons as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : experimental_setup ] . during the last few decades",
    "such studies have received wide attention and have stimulated the development of non - perturbative methods in quantum electrodynamics for the study of the coherent interaction between light and matter @xcite .",
    "the resonance fluorescence spectrum of a two - level system driven by a monochromatic electric field is the simplest case and has been studied extensively at optical frequencies @xcite . for a sufficiently strong continuous - wave ( cw ) driving field a nonlinear three - peak structure appears in the spectrum @xcite which is explained theoretically by the nonperturbative approach of mollow @xcite .",
    "the presence of three peaks , frequently called dynamic stark splitting , is explained as the result of the dressing of bare levels by the external field @xcite .",
    "a cw field is one of the few cases for which an exact analytical solution of the equations of motion ( eoms ) of the two - level system exists .",
    "when the system interacts with a short pulse , a special class of time - dependent functions , including the case of a hyperbolic secant pulse , were analytically explored for particular values of the physical parameters @xcite and a rich multipeak structure in the spectrum of resonance fluorescence was predicted @xcite .",
    "this property , which still represents a signature of rabi oscillations induced by the intense driving field , is also predicted to depend upon the pulse area , but can not be intuitively explained by means of dressed states @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate , in terms of a two - level model , the coherent interaction of x  rays with core electrons by exciting @xmath3-shell transitions .",
    "previous studies of strong - field resonance fluorescence have been relevant only at optical frequencies , for which a wide range of models and schemes have been investigated @xcite , because of the lack of coherent and sufficiently intense light sources at short wavelengths .",
    "the recent construction of free - electron lasers ( xfels ) @xcite provides one with tunable pulses of unprecedented brilliance , up to one billion times higher than the intensity available at third - generation synchrotron facilities .",
    "the intense and ultrafast pulses now available at xfels offer the opportunity to study nonlinear physics at short wavelengths @xcite . in the particular case that we are going to investigate here ,",
    "x  rays are able to induce stimulated emission and absorption of photons ( rabi flopping ) at a time scale that can be compared to and , therefore , compete with the ultrafast inner - shell auger decay @xcite .",
    "existing facilities such as the linac coherent light source ( lcls ) are based on the principle of self - amplified spontaneous emission ( sase ) @xcite , i.e. , the beam shot noise gives rise to the emitted radiation which , as a result , possesses only partial temporal coherence and a spiky temporal profile .",
    "an analogous situation occurred at the beginning of optical laser science , when it was timely to study the interaction with the chaotic pulses available at that time @xcite .",
    "self - seeding or optical laser - seeding methods are being developed , for which the emitted light is produced by the amplification of a regular ( gaussian ) seeding pulse , which exhibits high temporal coherence @xcite .",
    "the rapid development of xfel sources makes , therefore , further theoretical work timely @xcite .    in a recent experiment ,",
    "intense and ultrashort pulses from the lcls have been used to excite the @xmath0 transition at 848 @xmath1 in @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the electron spectrum of resonant auger decay was measured to investigate rabi flopping . with only partial coherence of the sase pulses presently available at lcls and the lack of means for single - shot diagnostics ,",
    "though , the clear observation of rabi oscillations and its distinction from noise effects is challenging @xcite .    auger decay is the predominant mechanism of inner - shell hole decay of light elements such as neon . because of the large auger yield",
    ", high - resolution electron spectroscopy is well suited for soft x  rays . besides auger decay ,",
    "also decay by fluorescence , i.e. , by spontaneous emission of photons , while the system is driven by an external field .",
    "the spectrum of resonance fluorescence represents an alternative way to study the coherent and nonlinear interaction between x  rays and atoms and ions .",
    "it complements the results coming from the detection of electron spectra of resonant auger decay .",
    "high gas densities can generally be used for emission spectroscopy ",
    "orders of magnitude larger than with electron spectroscopy  which compensates for the small fluorescence yield and enables high - resolution measurements with gratings or crystal spectrometers . in the case of resonance fluorescence , however , self - absorption can produce line broadening @xcite , so the gas density and path length need to be adjusted to minimize self - absorption effects and make them negligible .",
    "furthermore , photons are scattered much less off electrons or ions in the interaction volume than electrons , i.e. , space - charge effects are of little concern @xcite .    for energies , present instruments are expected to detect the fluorescence spectrum with high frequency resolution .",
    "for the purposes of this paper , there are at least three choices of instruments : a cryogenic spectrometer @xcite , a diffraction grating @xcite and a crystal spectrometer @xcite .",
    "cryogenic spectrometers such as microcalorimeters are mostly used in the astrophysics community for detecting x  rays from atoms with high atomic numbers and high fluorescence yield @xcite ; at 1 @xmath5 , ref .",
    "@xcite suggests a frequency resolution lower than 0.8 @xmath1 . for modern grating instruments based on the design described in @xcite and @xcite a resolution of 0.4 @xmath1 at 848",
    "@xmath1 is expected .",
    "it might also be possible to achieve higher frequency resolution by using higher - order reflections from gratings and crystals  though with loss of detection efficiency . with the use of wavelength - dispersive spectrometers , such as diffraction gratings and crystal spectrometers",
    ", one might take advantage of their polarization sensitivity in a parallel and perpendicular setup , e.g. , for background reduction @xcite .    in this paper",

    "<S> the spectrum of resonance fluorescence is calculated for a two - level system excited by an intense , ultrashort pulse made available for instance by free - electron lasers such as the linac coherent light source . </S>",
    "<S> we allow for inner - shell hole decay widths and destruction of the system by further photoionization . </S>",
    "<S> this two - level description is employed to model neon cations strongly driven by x  rays tuned to the @xmath0 transition at 848 @xmath1 ; the x  rays induce rabi oscillations which are so fast that they compete with ne @xmath2-hole decay . </S>",
    "<S> we predict resonance fluorescence spectra for two different scenarios : first , chaotic pulses based on the self - amplified spontaneous emission principle , like those presently generated at x - ray free - electron - laser facilities and , second , gaussian pulses which will become available in the foreseeable future with self - seeding techniques . </S>",
    "<S> as an example of the exciting opportunities derived from the use of seeding methods , we predict , in spite of above obstacles , the possibility to distinguish at frequencies a clear signature of rabi flopping in the spectrum of resonance fluorescence . </S>"
