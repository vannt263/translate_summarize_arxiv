    "we reformulate several notions in finite group theory in terms of diagrams in the category of finite groups , namely being solvable , nilpotent , @xmath0-group and prime - to-@xmath0 group , abelian , perfect , subnormal subgroup , injective and surjective homomorphism ( see fig .  1 and fig .  2 ) .",
    "these notions are enough to formulate the feit - thompson theorem .    these properties are obtained by iterating the same diagram chasing `` trick '' in the category of groups , often starting from a single morphism - counterexample ; the `` trick '' is known as the quillen lifting property and was introduced by quillen [ qui ] to axiomatise algebraic topology in terms of categories .",
