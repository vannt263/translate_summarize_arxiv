    "the potential energy landscape ( pel ) @xcite is the surface generated by the potential energy of a system . in the case of system composed by @xmath0 rigid molecules , it is an highly complex surface defined in a @xmath1 dimensional space . in recent years",
    ", numerical studies @xcite , boosted by the increased numerical resources , have attempted to quantify the statistical properties of this surface ( for example quantifying the distribution in energy of specific points of the surface , like local minima and saddles ) in the attempt to develop a thermodynamic description fully based on pel properties .",
    "this line of thinking , pioneered by frank stillinger and his coworkers @xcite , has been very fruitful in the study of supercooled liquids , both in equilibrium  @xcite and in out - of equilibrium conditions  @xcite .",
    "stillinger s formalism builds on the idea that the pel surface can be partitioned into disjoint basins .",
    "a basin is unambiguously defined as the set of points in configuration space connected to the same local minimum  named inherent structure ( is )  via a steepest - descendant trajectory . in this respect ,",
    "the pel s statistical properties entering in the evaluation of the partition function are the number , shape and depth of the pel basins . for its conceptual simplicity and its strict connection with numerical implementation",
    ", the pel formalism has become one of the modern tools to interpret and analyze simulation data .",
    "water , due to its intrinsic interest as liquid of life , has been extensively studied in computer simulations .",
    "models have been developed which are able to reproduce qualitatively the thermodynamic and dynamic anomalies of this liquid @xcite .",
    "indeed , water is characterized by a line of isobaric density maxima and compressibility minima . its specific heat @xmath2 increases on cooling  @xcite .",
    "recent studies have attempted to connect the thermodynamic anomalies to the presence of a line of first order transition between two liquid structures , eventually ending into a second order critical point  @xcite .",
    "dynamics in water also shows anomalies .",
    "the diffusion coefficient decreases as pressure is increased up to a maximum value ( approximately 400 mpa@xcite ) at room temperature . for greater pressures , water dynamics becomes progressively slower , as expected for simple liquids .",
    "water simulations have been among the first to be scrutinized using the methods developed by stillinger@xcite in the attempt to clarify differences in local structures and relations between structural properties and dynamics .",
    "more recently , extensive studies of the pel properties have been published , providing a detailed description of the landscape properties of several models of water@xcite . within the pel formalism ,",
    "attempts have also been presented in the direction of connecting thermodynamic properties ( like the number of explored minima or the number of diffusive directions in the pel ) to dynamics @xcite .",
    "the outcome of these works , and related studies on different models of glass forming liquids , suggests a strong connection between dynamics and landscape properties .",
    "still , the interpretation schemes require fitting parameters whose physical interpretation in often unclear . as an example",
    ", it has been shown that @xmath3 is consistent with a @xmath4 dependence @xcite ( being @xmath5 the configurational entropy ) but no understanding of the proportionality coefficient in term of pel properties has been reported @xcite .    in this article we report analysis of distinct equilibrium trajectories of a system of 216 water molecules interacting via a two body potential .",
    "the novel aspect is the possibility of comparing a large number of independent trajectories ( more than 100 for each state point ) for a large number of state points .",
    "each of these ( previously equilibrated ) independent trajectories last more than 20 ns , at which time  even at the slowest studied temperature  the average displacement of the molecule is longer than three nearest neighbors .",
    "the analysis of this set of data shows that , while individually each trajectory appear to be to a very good approximation a diffusive trajectory ( i.e. with a mean square displacement which increases linearly with time ) different realizations are characterized by apparent values of the diffusion coefficient which differ by more than one order of magnitude , a clear evidence of dynamic heterogeneities .",
    "we also show that differences in dynamics are strongly coupled with the location of the system on the pel , providing evidence that dynamic heterogeneities are related to inhomogeneities in the local basin energies . for completeness",
    ", we briefly discuss the distribution of is energies for this model and the temperature and density ( @xmath6 dependence of the diffusion coefficient , presenting new data with significantly improved statistics .",
    "we analyze molecular dynamics trajectories of a system composed of 216 rigid water molecules in the ( nve ) ensemble .",
    "molecules interact via the widely studied two - body simple point charge extended ( spc / e ) model @xcite .",
    "the integration step is 1 @xmath7 second , and long range interactions are taken in account using the reaction field method .",
    "dynamics and thermodynamics properties for the spc / e model have been extensively studied in the past @xcite in a wide range of temperatures and densities .",
    "analysis of the statistical properties of the potential energy landscape have also been characterized @xcite . here",

    ", we analyze equilibrated trajectories of more than 100 independent realizations , to both reduce significantly the numerical error and to estimate the self - averaging properties of this model for different @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "each trajectory covers a time interval of about 20 ns .",
    "potential energy landscape properties have been based on the analysis of the inherent structures , which has been calculated using a standard conjugate gradient minimization algorithm with @xmath11 tolerance @xcite .",
    "a quantification of the statistical properties of the potential energy landscape , i.e. the distribution of basin s depth and shapes , for the spc / e model of water has been recently reported@xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the number @xmath12 of distinct basins of energy depth @xmath13 between @xmath13 and @xmath14 follows a gaussian distribution ,    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the total number of distinct basins of the pel for the system of @xmath0 molecules , @xmath17 is the energy scale of the distribution and @xmath18 is the variance .",

    "if the length of each trajectory is sufficiently long , so that the system is able to sample all basins which are statistically relevant at that temperature , the distribution should be peaked around the average of @xmath22 , with a small variance .",

    "[ fig : dist2]-b show that this is the case only at the higher @xmath9 . on cooling , the relaxation time of the system increases and , within the time of the simulation , the system retains memory of the initial basin .",

    "this may suggest a strong relation between depth of the explored basin and dynamics , which can not be attributed to differences in thermal energy , since all different realizations have the same kinetic energy .",

    "we have detected a progressive increase of the fluctuations on cooling , already in the region of early supercooling , where mct appears to provide a consistent description of the dynamics@xcite .",
    "interestingly , self - averaging properties appear to set in only after molecules have diffused several particle diameters .",

    "we have also observed a clear correlation between the apparent diffusion coefficient of the individual realizations and depth of the sampled pel ( fig.[fig : eisd095 ] ) .",
    "again , the comparison of different trajectories , all at the same temperature , helps in eliminating trivial ( but a priory unknown ) thermal effect , highlighting the connection between dynamics and is energies . in this respect",
