    "the sign of the electric dipole moment produced by the cme is also fixed ( parity violation ) . however ,",
    "positive and negative topological charges are equally likely and can not be distinguished on an event - by - event basis .",

    "since the msc is not a pure harmonic , its event plane resolution correction is also not generally localized within one harmonic .",

    "[ fig : msc_comparison ] , femtoscopic correlations are qualitatively demonstrated by the model calculation of therminator  @xcite .",
    "therminator is a monte carlo event generator designed for studying of particle production in relativistic heavy - ion collisions , and includes estimates of the effects of resonance decays , quantum interference , final - state - interactions and collective motions . to suppress the contribution from femtoscopic correlations",
    ", we applied the conditions of @xmath99 gev/@xmath5 and @xmath100 to the three - point correlator , shown with the grey bars in fig .",
    "[ fig : msc_comparison ] .",
    "femtoscopic correlations are sensitive to the size of the emission volume at freeze - out @xcite .",
    "the difference between in - plane and out - of - plane correlations in the kinematic region with prominent femtoscopic correlations can be due to a difference in the emission volumes probed by in and out - of - plane parts .",
    "such a difference may arrise from an azimuthally anisotropic freeze - out distribution coupled with elliptic flow .",
    "correlations sensitive to charge separation in heavy - ion collisions have been presented .",
    "consistency between correlations with respect to @xmath85 and @xmath83 harmonic event planes demonstrates that the signal is likely to be related to the reaction plane .",
    "also presented was a reduced version of the three - point correlation in which all regions of charge separation are weighted equally .",
    "the same qualitative signal was found to persist in this scheme as well .",
    "the signal shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : msc_comparison ] is largely determined by the sign ( @xmath121 ) of the cosine and sine functions in eq .",
    "[ eq : threepoint ] .",
    "we also explicitly counted units of charge separation with which we could better understand the source of the opposite charge suppression .",
    "a parity conserving background , due to momentum conservation and collective flow , is more likely to explain the suppression rather than the medium induced back - to - back suppression previously supposed  @xcite .",
    "a comparison of the rms values for @xmath66 and @xmath67 suggests greater charge separation fluctuations perpendicular to rather than parallel to the event plane .",
    "the cme as well as @xmath1-even processes such as the decays of resonances with sizable @xmath20 may both contribute to this feature .",
    "the differential analysis of the in - plane and out - of - plane parts of the three - point correlator versus @xmath98 and @xmath122 reveals femtoscopic contributions at low relative momentum .",
    "the positive signal in fig .",
    "[ fig : msc_comparison ] for opposite charge correlations in peripheral collisions is largely found in the low relative momentum regions of fig .",
    "[ fig : eta ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : pt ] .",
    "this can possibly be explained by the final - state - interactions ( @xmath1-even ) of different emission volumes probed by in - plane and out - of - plane parts .    excluding low relative momentum pairs",
    "significantly reduces the positive contributions to opposite charge correlations in fig .",
    "[ fig : msc_comparison ] .",
    "however , the difference between same and opposite charge correlations remains largely unchanged and consistent with the expectations of the cme .",
    "@xmath1-even local charge conservation coupled to elliptic flow modeled by charge balance functions has also been shown to generate same charge three - point correlations comparable to the observed one  @xcite .",
    "a careful calculation of the mentioned @xmath1-even backgrounds needs to be made before a further assessment of the chiral magnetic effect can be made in heavy - ion collisions .",
