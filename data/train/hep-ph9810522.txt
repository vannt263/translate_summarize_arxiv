    "this might be enough to provide limits for @xmath1 and @xmath2 vertices , which are absent in the standard model of electroweak interactions at tree - level .",
    "however , physics beyond the standard model might give strong contributions to neutral gauge boson vertices @xcite .",

    "the anomalous parameter @xmath10 in ( [ fvertex ] ) leads to violation of @xmath11 and @xmath12 symmetry , but maintains invariance under @xmath0 transformations , while @xmath13 would introduce @xmath0 violation in ( [ fvertex ] ) .",
    "the differential standard model cross - section for @xmath3 production in @xmath14 annihilation is known for almost 20 years @xcite .",
    "also , the effects of anomalous neutral gauge boson couplings in the production of @xmath15 , @xmath3 , and @xmath16 bosons have been studied , see e.g.  @xcite",
    ". in @xmath17 production processes at the tevatron @xcite and lep @xcite , limits to the vertex @xmath18 were obtained .",
    "however , they can not be transferred to @xmath5 pair production , since the anomalous couplings in equation  ( [ fvertex ] ) are independent of couplings in @xmath17 production .",
    "the differential cross - section for @xmath3 production is presented in this section .",
    "it is obtained for the various spin combinations of final state @xmath5 bosons .",
    "this allows to determine their sensitivity to the anomalous couplings .",
    "the finite width effects of the produced @xmath5 bosons are considered by convoluting the cross - section for @xmath3 production with two breit - wigner functions .",
    "the differential cross - section is then expressed by the sum : @xmath19 with @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 stand for the possible @xmath5 boson helicities @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , which are defined by the vectors : @xmath26 the klln function @xmath27 , the breit - wigner factors @xmath28 and other notations may be inferred from @xcite .",

    "these are spin 2 states and can not be produced by the @xmath46-channel diagrams .",
    "equations  ( [ 00s+ ] )  ( [ 00i- ] ) exhibit that the @xmath0 violating couplings proportional to @xmath13do neither interfere with the standard model terms nor with terms proportional to @xmath10 .",
    "a further conclusion is that it is impossible to separate out the effects of the parameters @xmath56 and @xmath57 on the differential cross - section of the process @xmath4 .",

    "radiative corrections to ( [ comp ] ) due to initial state radiation , see e.g. @xcite , can be applied in the structure function approach including a lorentz boost of the scattering angle as described similarly in @xmath64 pair production @xcite .",
    "the presented analytical results demonstrate how potential anomalous couplings change the differential @xmath3 production cross - section .",
    "anomalous couplings will have their main effect in the production of a longitudinally and a transversally polarized @xmath5 boson . for on - shell @xmath3 production ,",
    "these are the only spin combinations which are sensitive to an anomalous signal . effects of non - vanishing @xmath13 and @xmath10 on the final states with two transversally or two longitudinally polarized @xmath5 bosons are zero or are suppressed by a factor @xmath65 .    therefore , a measurement of the final state spins might be used to increase the ratio of the anomalous signal over the standard model background .",
    "but , since only one type of spin combinations is sensitive to anomalous couplings , a spin analysis can not be used to disentangle the signals from @xmath13 and @xmath10 . however , due to the interference contribution of @xmath10 in ( [ 0pi+ ] ) and ( [ pi+0 ] ) , the anomalous parameters @xmath13 and @xmath10 show different angular distributions and it might be possible to separate out their effects at lep2 .    * acknowledgment",
