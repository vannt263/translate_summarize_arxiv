    "amongst the observed properties of cataclysmic variable binary systems ( cvs ) , the most reliably determined quantity is the orbital period .",
    "the distribution of these orbital periods is fundamental , and theoretical interpretation of its features requires knowledge of the formation and evolution of these systems . despite the increase in the number of cvs with determined orbital period to more than 500 systems as a result of their discovery in optical surveys in the last decade ,",
    "their orbital period distribution has continued to defy explanation .",
    "this has , in part , been due to our poor knowledge of the theoretical description of the angular momentum loss processes which are essential for understanding the evolution of these systems .",
    "the major uncertainty stems from our lack of a fundamental theory for angular momentum loss associated with a magnetically coupled stellar wind .",
    "the form of magnetic braking that has been the basis of most previous works on the evolution of cvs traces back to the pioneering work of skumanich ( 1972 ) , who determined that the stellar rotational velocity of slowly rotating main sequence g type stars varied inversely proportional to the square root of its age .",
    "donor stars in cvs , however , typically rotate much more rapidly ( with rotation periods @xmath1hrs ) than single stars of the same spectral type , and the implicit assumption that the form of angular momentum loss derived for slow rotation can be extrapolated and applied to fast rotators is without substantiation .",
    "based on theoretical grounds , a departure from this form is expected since the acceleration of the stellar wind changes from thermally driven to centrifugally driven as the rotation speed increases .",
    "it is now generally accepted that the angular momentum loss rate from rapidly rotating single stars is severely overestimated by the rate based on the use of the skumanich relation ( macgregor & brenner 1991 ; stpie 1995 ; andronov et al .",
    "2003 ; ivanova & taam 2003 ) .",
    "other properties of the angular momentum loss associated with magnetic braking have been inferred from the existence of a gap from 2.25hrs to 2.75hrs in the observed orbital period distribution of cvs .",
    "this feature in the distribution has been interpreted in terms of a sudden decrease in the angular momentum loss rate attributed to disrupted magnetic braking ( see spruit & ritter 1983 ; rappaport , verbunt , & joss 1983 ) , possibly reflecting a transition of the donor star from one with a radiative core and a convective envelope to one with a fully convective structure .",
    "the observational evidence supporting such a discontinuous change at the fully convective transition on the main sequence is , however , lacking ( see for example , andronov et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "in addition to the observationally unsubstantiated phenomenological description of angular momentum loss related to the period gap ( kolb 2002 ) , difficulties also exist in reproducing the high value of the period minimum at 80minutes , the lack of accumulation of systems at the period minimum predicted by the standard model , the almost equal number of cvs above the upper edge of the gap at 2.75hrs and below the lower edge of the gap at 2.25hrs ( e.g. barker & kolb 2003 ) , and the spread of mass - transfer rates at a given orbital period ( see spruit & taam 2001 ) .",
    "based on the work of kolb & baraffe ( 1999 ) , the period minimum could be shifted to the observed value provided that additional angular momentum loss processes operate such that the rate is increased by about a factor of 4 above that due to gravitational radiation alone .",
    "however , such a solution does not lead to a smearing out of the number of systems at the period minimum .",
    "other indirect evidence which suggests the need for additional angular momentum losses has been provided by patterson ( 2001 ) .",
    "specifically , by using a statistical argument that the average white dwarf mass is @xmath2 , he deduced that there appears to be a systematic shift in the mass - radius relation for secondaries in short - period cvs , finding radii that are larger than those predicted from standard stellar models subjected to mass loss driven by gravitational radiation . since the stellar radius is a function of the degree to which the donor is driven out of thermal equilibrium ,",
    "higher angular momentum losses above that given by gravitational radiation are required .    against this backdrop , additional angular momentum losses associated with some form of residual magnetic braking or mass loss have been hypothesized .",
    "although this is possible , it is not a viable solution unless it is different for cvs with different present or past system properties ( e.g. different initial donor masses ) , for otherwise the period spike at the period minimum would remain .",
    "further evidence contrary to this hypothesis stems from theoretical studies suggesting that magnetic braking is suppressed in magnetic cvs ( see li , wu , & wickramasinghe 1994 ) .",
    "observational evidence for the suppression of magnetic braking in magnetic cvs results from the measurements of the effective temperatures of magnetic white dwarfs ( wds ) ( araujo - betancor et al .",
    "2005 ; gnsicke & townsley 2005 ) showing that the magnetic cvs are characterized by lower mass accretion rates than dwarf novae at the same orbital period .",
    "thus , even if residual braking is present , it should be even less for the magnetic cvs , which , barring a fortuitous coincidence , would conflict with the observational result that the orbital period distributions of magnetic and non magnetic cvs below the period gap are similar .    among other possible mechanisms ,",
    "consequential angular momentum losses associated with mass transfer from the donor have been explored by barker & kolb ( 2003 ) . by applying a generic prescription for the process",
    ", barker & kolb ( 2003 ) find that the shift of the period minimum to the observed value could not be achieved even assuming the mechanism to be maximally efficient .    given that these alternative angular momentum loss mechanisms fail to reproduce the observed short period distribution we seek an alternative or additional agent to remove angular momentum from the system .",
    "as an example , we explore the consequences of cv evolution based on the inclusion of a circumbinary ( cb ) disk ( spruit & taam 2001 ; taam & spruit 2001 ) on the period distribution . direct detection of this matter by absorption line studies ( belle et al . 2004 ) and infrared continuum studies ( dubus et al .",
    "2004 ) has so far been elusive and difficult to interpret , partly because of the lack of accurate disk atmosphere models . by including a cb disk in the evolution we not only provide an indication of the ingredients necessary for an angular momentum loss process to reproduce the observed period distribution , but",
    "also make it possible to identify the basic properties of such circumbinary material in typical systems .    in order to demonstrate its possible effect on the evolution of cvs",
    ", a population synthesis differential analysis is required to examine the differences between the standard model and a model invoking cb disks . in this way",
    ", the strengths and weaknesses of each can be identified to determine the properties of the angular momentum loss processes that best reproduce the observed period distribution . in comparing the theoretical distributions with the observed distributions ,",
    "a treatment of the selection effects will be necessary since complete surveys of cvs to a given distance are not available .    in this paper",
    ", we report on the results of a population synthesis for cvs formed at short orbital periods ( less than 2.75hrs ) . in the next section",
    "we describe the computational technique and outline the assumptions inherent in this study .",
    "the construction of the zero age cv ( zacv ) population will be presented in  3 .",
    "the intrinsic period distribution of cvs , a description of the selection effects , and their application to the intrinsic orbital period distribution is presented in  4 .",
    "finally , we discuss the implications of our numerical results and conclude in the last section .",
    "a hybrid binary population synthesis technique is used in which the output of a rapid binary population synthesis code is combined with detailed evolutionary tracks describing the evolution of cvs .",
    "the approach is similar to that adopted by kolb ( 1993 ) who , for computational efficiency , combined secular evolution tracks from a simplifying bipolytrope stellar evolution code with cv birth rates computed by politano ( 1988 ) and de kool ( 1992 ) .",
    "we note that bipolytropes were also used by howell , nelson , & rappaport ( 2001 ) in a study that focused on the 2 - 3hr period gap in the observed cv orbital period distribution .",
    "the main ingredients of the population synthesis scheme adopted in the present paper are described in more detail in the following subsections .",
    "the biseps binary population synthesis code described by willems & kolb ( 2002 , 2004 ) is used to construct a population of zacvs in the four - dimensional @xmath3-space , where @xmath4 denotes the time , @xmath5 the mass of the wd , @xmath6 the mass of the donor star , and @xmath7 the orbital period .",
    "the initial primary and secondary masses are chosen from a grid of 80 logarithmically spaced masses in the interval from @xmath8 to @xmath9 , and the initial orbital periods from a grid of 300 logarithmically spaced periods ranging from 0.1 to 10000 days . for symmetry reasons only binaries with @xmath10",
    "are evolved .",
    "our sample of zero - age main - sequence binaries then typically consists of @xmath11 systems .",
    "all stars are assumed to have population  i chemical compositions .",
    "the probability that the primary ( the wd progenitor ) has an initial mass @xmath12 is determined by the initial mass function @xmath13 while the probability that the secondary ( the future cv donor star ) has an initial mass @xmath14 is determined from the initial mass ratio distribution @xmath15 ( kroupa , tout , & gilmore 1993 ; hurley , tout , & pols 2002 ) . in eq .",
    "( [ imrd ] ) , @xmath16 is the mass ratio of the stars when the binary is formed , @xmath17 is a constant , and @xmath18 is a normalisation factor depending on @xmath17 .",
    "in addition to the initial mass ratio distribution given by eq .",
    "( [ imrd ] ) , we also consider the possibility that the initial secondary mass is distributed independently according to the same initial mass function as @xmath12 .",
    "the flat initial mass ratio distribution corresponding to @xmath19 and @xmath20 is considered to be our reference distribution .",
    "the distribution of initial orbital separations @xmath21 , finally , is assumed to be logarithmically flat between 3 and @xmath22 , i.e. @xmath23 ( iben & tutukov 1984 , hurley et al . 2002 ) .    in order to derive absolute formation rates and numbers of systems presently occupying the galaxy , the above distribution functions , which are all normalized to unity , need to be supplemented with a star formation rate and a binary fraction .",
    "for this purpose , it is assumed that all stars are in binaries , and that the galaxy has an age of 10gyr . the star formation rate",
    "is then taken to be constant throughout the life time of the galaxy and normalized so that one binary with @xmath24 is born each year .",
    "this is in agreement with the observationally inferred formation rate of wds in the galaxy ( weidemann 1990 ) .",
    "one of the critical evolutionary phases in the formation of cvs is the common - envelope ( ce ) phase that leads to the formation of the wd .",
    "for ease of comparison , this phase is modelled in a manner similar to other investigations by equating the binding energy of the envelope to the change in orbital energy as @xmath25\\ !",

    "de kool 1992 , politano 1996 ) .",
    "if a binary survives the ce phase , its ability to evolve into a cv depends on the post - ce orbital separation . for sufficiently close orbits , the binary may evolve into a semi - detached state either through the nuclear expansion of the main - sequence secondary or through the loss of orbital angular momentum via magnetic braking and/or gravitational radiation . depending on the masses of the binary components and the evolutionary state of the donor star ,",
    "the ensuing mass - transfer phase may initially take place on the thermal time scale of the donor star . in this study , we leave aside these more complicated systems and focus on cvs whose formation is driven by angular momentum losses from the system rather than the nuclear evolution of the donor . for an elaborate discussion of cvs forming through a thermal time",
    "scale mass - transfer phase , see kolb & willems ( 2005 ) .    due to the uncertainties in the magnitude and form of the angular momentum loss rate associated with magnetic braking ( see  1 ) , we focus on the cvs below the upper edge of the period gap and adopt a simple prescription in our calculations assuming that it takes place on a constant time scale of 10gyr for main - sequence stars with masses in the interval between @xmath35 and @xmath36 . for stars less massive than @xmath35 and stars more massive than @xmath37 we assume that magnetic braking is ineffective . orbital evolution due to gravitational radiation",
    "is treated in the weak - field approximation using the formulae given by hurley et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . at the onset of the cv phase",
    ", the stability of mass transfer is determined using the radius - mass exponents tabulated by hjellming ( 1987 ) and by assuming that mass transfer proceeds in the fully non - conservative approximation .",
    "as mentioned above , we only consider systems for which mass transfer is dynamically and thermally stable .",
    "the evolution of the binary after the onset of the cv phase is followed using detailed evolutionary tracks obtained from a full binary evolution code .",
    "the tracks and the main features of the code are described in more detail in the following section .",
    "the input physics and the evolutionary code used in the construction of the binary evolutionary sequences are described in taam et al .",
    "they are based on an updated stellar evolution code originally developed by eggleton ( 1971 , 1972 ) .",
    "the stellar models were characterized by a solar metallicity and a helium abundance of @xmath38 . as a simplifying approximation ,",
    "the binary evolution is assumed fully non - conservative as a result of efficient mass loss during a nova explosion so that the mass of the wd is fixed throughout the evolution .",
    "based upon the work of taam et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , the fraction of the transferred mass corresponding to @xmath39 was assumed to be deposited into a cb disk .",
    "the evolution of the cb disk was followed using a fully implicit method ( dubus , taam , & spruit 2002 ) and implemented into the binary evolutionary calculations as described in taam et al .",
    "hence , the angular momentum loss from binaries with initial orbital periods less than about 2.75hrs includes gravitational radiation losses , losses associated with mass ejections in nova outbursts ( with the lost material carrying a specific angular momentum corresponding to the orbital motion of the wd ) , and losses due to gravitational torques from a cb disk ( spruit & taam 2001 ) .    for comparison with population synthesis studies based on evolutionary tracks without cb disks ,",
    "we have also constructed a second set of binary sequences with angular momentum losses associated with gravitational radiation and long - term mean mass - loss rates from the system due to nova explosions only .    as we shall see in  4 , the essential features which significantly influence the orbital period distributions result from the fact that the evolutionary tracks with cb disks do not converge to a common track near the period minimum ( taam et al . 2003 ) .",
    "that is , the addition of this form of angular momentum loss leads to tracks which are a function of the initial properties of the binary system at the time at which roche lobe overflow is initiated ( see  4.2 ) .",
    "a detailed study of the orbital period distribution of cvs below the period gap requires high resolution histograms with bin sizes of the order of a few minutes .",
    "since the grid of evolutionary sequences was calculated with steps of @xmath40 in the initial mass of the donor star , corresponding to steps of @xmath41min in the initial period , the density of the available sequences was increased using cubic spline interpolations between sets of neighboring tracks . in both cases ( evolution with or without cb disk ) , this increased the number of binary evolution sequences for cvs forming with periods below 2.75hrs from @xmath42 to @xmath43 .",
    "to understand the systematic behavior of the orbital period distributions resulting from the binary population synthesis calculations , we first scrutinize the dependency of cv _ formation _ on the model parameters .",
    "for this purpose , we compare the populations of newborn cvs obtained by varying the product @xmath44 parameterizing the ce phase as well as the initial mass ratio or the initial secondary mass distribution . in our reference model , model a , we set @xmath45 . in models",
    "ce1 and  ce8 , we respectively decrease and increase the product @xmath46 by a factor of 5 , independent of the evolutionary stage and envelope mass of the binary component initiating the ce phase . in model dce1",
    ", we assume the envelope ejection process to be easier or more efficient for dynamically unstable case  c mass transfer than for dynamically unstable case  b mass transfer , as suggested by fig . 1 in dewi & tauris ( 2000 ) .",
    "in our last model , model dce5 , we assume that low - mass envelopes are easier to eject than high - mass envelopes based on the importance of spin up of the envelope ( see sandquist et al .",
    "the values of the @xmath46 parameters adopted in the different population synthesis models are summarised in table  [ models ] .",
    "the range of values and parametrizations as well as the adopted initial mass ratio or initial secondary mass distributions were chosen to be sufficiently wide to emphasize the differences in the resulting cv populations .",
    "[ zacv ] shows the present - day cv formation rate as a function of the orbital period for three different initial mass - ratio distributions @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 .",
    "we note that we use @xmath50 instead of @xmath51 because the latter poses a normalization problem for mass ratios in the range @xmath52 .",
    "we first turn our attention to the case of the flat initial mass - ratio distributions @xmath47 and our reference model  a. going from longer to shorter orbital periods , the orbital period distribution gently rises until it reaches a local maximum at @xmath53 . the following dip between @xmath54 and @xmath55min",
    "is associated with the dynamical instability of mass transfer from donor stars with deep convective envelopes ( see de kool 1992 for details ) . the steep rise in the birthrates towards even shorter orbital periods is terminated by an abrupt decrease in the number of cvs formed at periods just below @xmath56 which , for zams stars , corresponds to a donor mass @xmath57 .",
    "this decrease is associated with the switch - off of magnetic braking for fully convective stars .",
    "below @xmath58 , gravitational radiation is therefore the only angular - momentum loss mechanism available to bring white dwarf main - sequence star binaries into contact .",
    "the local maximum at @xmath59min is due to cvs containing he wds which , because of mass transfer stability requirements , are absent at orbital periods longer than @xmath60min .    from eq .",
    "( [ ce ] ) , it is easily seen that the post - ce orbital separations increase with increasing values of @xmath44 . for case b rlo systems this implies that the number of systems surviving the ce phase increases with increasing @xmath46 .",
    "hence , for larger values of @xmath46 , more cvs with he wds are formed . for case c rlo systems ,",
    "the orbital separation at the onset of the ce phase is larger , so that survival of the ce phase is less of an issue .",
    "however , increasing @xmath46 makes it more difficult for wd systems with main sequence companions to evolve into contact after the ce phase .",
    "consequently , the ratio of the number of systems forming with he wds ( at periods below @xmath61min ) to the number of systems forming with c / o and o / ne / mg wds ( mainly at periods above @xmath60min ) increases with increasing @xmath46 .",
    "these dependencies explain the basic differences between the orbital period distributions found for different ce model parameters ( see table  [ models ] ) .",
    "the distribution of the formation rates of systems with he wds is furthermore seen to be particularly sensitive to the ce model . for @xmath62 ( model  ce8 ) , we note a pronounced gap in the zacv orbital period distribution near @xmath63 , caused by a decrease of the upper limit on the he wd mass in the cv population which in turn causes a decrease in the maximum donor star mass leading to stable mass transfer .",
    "this decrease is related to the fact that the most massive he wds stem from late case  b ce phases which , for a large ce ejection efficiency , lead to post - ce orbits that are too wide for the system to evolve into a cv within the adopted galactic age limit of 10gyr .",
    "systems with o / ne / mg wds have very small formation rates in all models considered .",
    "a mass ratio distribution @xmath50 favoring lower @xmath64-values ( or , for a given @xmath12 , lower @xmath14-values ) increases the relative number of systems below @xmath65min in all models considered . a mass ratio distribution function such that the secondary mass @xmath14 is chosen independently from the same imf as @xmath12 leads to a similar result in the relative number of systems below @xmath66min with the effect slightly enhanced .",
    "the shape of the orbital period distribution is furthermore also very similar in these two cases . in particular ,",
    "the peak of the orbital period distribution at @xmath67min is in both cases strongly reduced to a tiny bump that is barely visible in the distributions . on the other hand",
    ", a mass ratio distribution @xmath48 favoring equal mass ratios tends to increase the relative number of systems forming at longer orbital periods or , equivalently , the relative number of systems with higher donor masses , leading to peaks of the period distribution of comparable heights at @xmath68min and @xmath67min .",
    "we also note that the relative contribution of he wd systems to the cv birth rate at periods shorter than @xmath56 is smallest for @xmath50 and largest for @xmath48 . in the case of the initial mass ratio distribution @xmath48",
    ", our standard model ( model a ) furthermore shows the same basic features as found by de kool ( 1992 ) and politano ( 1996 ) , even though their results were derived under the assumption that the mass transfer process in the system is conservative .",
    "the @xmath50 case can furthermore be compared favorably to de kool s ( 1992 ) results for an independent choice of @xmath14 taken from the same imf as @xmath12 .",
    "table  [ br ] lists the total birth rate of all cvs forming at periods shorter than 2.75hrs as well as the separate birth rates for cvs containing he , c / o , and o / ne / mg wds at the current epoch . for a given initial mass ratio or secondary mass distribution , the total birth rate of cvs below 2.75hrs changes by at most a factor of 2 - 3 between different population synthesis models .",
    "the birth rates are largest when @xmath14 is distributed independently according to the same imf as @xmath12 ( on the order of @xmath69 ) , and smallest when @xmath50 ( on the order of @xmath70 ) .",
    "consequently , even though the shape of the distribution functions of the birth rate as a function of orbital period is similar in these two cases , their magnitudes are not . in the case of a flat initial mass ratio distribution @xmath47 ,",
    "the birth rates are of the order of @xmath71 .",
    "when the birth rates of cvs with different types of wds are considered separately , the formation rates of systems with o / ne / mg wds are always 2 to 3 orders of magnitude smaller than those of systems with he or c / o wds .",
    "this is a direct result of the rapid decrease of the initial mass function with increasing mass @xmath12 of the wd progenitor as well as the relatively small primary mass range giving rise to o / ne / mg wds ( @xmath72 ) . in the case of population synthesis model ce1 , no systems with o",
    "/ ne / mg wds are formed below @xmath73hrs due to the decrease of the post - ce orbital separation with increasing mass @xmath12 of the wd progenitor : when combined with the small ce ejection efficiency @xmath74 , this behavior requires large pre - ce orbital separations in order for the binary to survive the ce phase .",
    "this leaves only a small range of separations for which the secondary is still able to fill its roche lobe while on the main - sequence .",
    "outside this range , roche - lobe overflow from the wd s companion does not occur until it becomes a giant star .",
    "depending on the initial mass ratio or initial secondary mass distribution and the adopted ce model , the contribution of systems with he wds to the birth rate of galactic cvs below 2.75hrs ranges from 40 to 90% . in the case of model",
    "a and a flat initial mass ratio distribution , about 65% of all cvs below 2.75hrs are born with he wds .",
    "the relative contribution of systems with he wds to the cv birth rate is furthermore always largest for models ce8 and dce1 .",
    "correspondingly , the relative contribution of systems with c / o wds is smallest for these models .",
    "this is caused by the wider post - ce orbital separations of the c / o wd cv progenitors which significantly reduces the number of systems able to become semi - detached within the age of the galaxy .",
    "similarly , the relative contribution of systems with he wds is smallest for model ce1 because the small @xmath44 value makes it harder for the progenitors of these systems to survive the ce phase that forms the wd . finally , for a given ce model , the relative contribution of c / o wd systems to the cv birth rate below 2.75hrs decreases from @xmath50 to @xmath48",
    "this is caused by the fact that c / o wds in cvs are formed from stars with initial masses larger than about @xmath75 .",
    "hence , if initial mass ratios close to unity are favored in the primordial population , the majority of the donor stars in cvs containing c / o wds will be too massive to initiate a dynamically and thermally stable mass - transfer phase .",
    "in the following subsections , we focus on the theoretical present - day orbital period distribution of cvs with periods below 2.75 hr , and compare population synthesis results for systems evolving under the influence of a cb disk and gravitational radiation with results for systems evolving under the influence of gravitational radiation only . in both cases ,",
    "we adopt the fully non - conservative approximation and , unless stated otherwise , assume that no systems formed at periods longer than 2.75hrs evolve to periods below 2.75hrs . the distributions are also compared with the observed cv orbital period distribution consisting of nonmagnetic and magnetic cvs . for ease of comparison ,",
    "all distribution functions are normalised to unity .",

    "4.1 , the intrinsic present - day cv population without account of observational selection effects is examined .",
    "we note , however , that a direct comparison of the theoretical and observed orbital period distributions is only possible if a complete sample of observed cvs is available . in  4.2 , we therefore model the possible selection effects in a simple manner by weighing the contribution of a system to the population of cvs according to a factor determined by the accretion luminosity .",
    "detailed modeling of the selection effect is highly uncertain since it depends , for example , on the bolometric corrections of the emission from a non steady accretion disk , and it is beyond the scope of the present investigation .",
    "hence , we adopt a simple luminosity weighting factor to provide us with at least an indication of the observational selection effects .",

    "in particular , @xmath78 indicates that the cdfs of the orbital periods of observed and simulated cv populations are significantly different , while @xmath79 indicates that the two cdfs are in very good agreement .",

    "alternatively , this trend could also be achieved for a range of constant mass input rates in the cb disk at a given initial orbital period with those systems characterized by higher mass input rates having longer bounce periods .",
    "for example , fractional mass input rates into the cb disk as high as @xmath145 would lead to bounce periods near the orbital period at which mass transfer is initiated ( see taam et al .",
    "2003 ) , whereas mass input rates significantly less than the values adopted here would correspond to evolutions similar to those for which gravitational radiation losses were the only angular momentum loss mechanism considered .",
    "based on this behavior , we tentatively constrain the fractional mass input rates into the cb disk to be in the range from @xmath146 to @xmath145 .",
    "a more stringent range would require a population synthesis study of cvs with cb disk for a range of mass input rates .",
    "we also note that the calculated mass - transfer rates found for the short period non magnetic cvs lie in the range for which the accretion disk is thermally unstable ( e.g. osaki 1996 ; hameury et al . 1998 ) .",
    "this suggests that the permanent superhump systems , which are believed to be systems accreting at sufficiently high mass transfer rates such that the accretion disks are thermally stable , may form only a very small fraction of the cv population corresponding to higher angular momentum loss rates than those found here or to a small fraction of the cv phase if mass - transfer cycles occur about the secular mean values of the mass - transfer rate ( e.g. , king et al .",
    "1996 ; bning & ritter 2004 ) .    since there do not exist complete cv surveys to a given distance , observational selection effects should be accounted for in the discovery of cvs . in this study",
    "we have applied a simple approximation for the weighting factor , in which the intrinsic period distributions were weighted by the accretion luminosity to the power of 1.5 .",
    "this would be appropriate for the systems below the period gap where it is not likely that they would be discovered beyond the thickness of the galactic disk due to their low mass - transfer rates .    for the population of systems formed below 2.75 hours",
    ", the period distribution immediately below the lower edge of the period gap , on the other hand , is not in agreement with observations because the number of systems increases gradually with decreasing orbital period .",
    "the steepness of the observed orbital period distribution at the lower edge of the period gap can be affected by a significant modification of the zacv population and evolution near the lower edge of the period gap , or by flow of systems from orbital periods above the period gap . to avoid fine tuning in the parameters governing the zacv population and angular momentum loss process",
    ", we have considered the possibility of a flow of systems from longer orbital periods .",
    "accordingly , we have explored the possibility of increasing the formation rate at 2.25 hours so that the number of systems from the lower edge of the period gap to shorter orbital periods can be increased more sharply .",
    "we have found that the inclusion of this flow does not significantly affect the position of the peak , shifting it from @xmath88min to about @xmath144min ; however , the decrease in the number of systems to the minimum period is steeper and is in better agreement with observation .",
    "in addition , the inclusion of the flow from orbital periods above the period gap can result in a sharp increase in the number of systems from 2.25hrs to 2hrs . in this case , the overall properties of the period distribution obtained from the population synthesis models are remarkably similar to that observed , suggesting that evolution with additional angular momentum losses coupled with a flow from above the gap is necessary in the lowest order of approximation .",
    "we point out that although our results give an indication of the effect of a flow of cvs from longer orbital periods , they do not constrain the fraction of cvs which evolve from above the period gap to below the period gap since it depends on the assumptions of the orbital braking mechanism .",
    "the evolution of cvs above the gap with both main sequence and evolved donors driven by magnetic braking processes operating on timescales shorter than @xmath147 years would need to be included in our population synthesis study to address this issue .",
    "although the qualitative description of the cv period distributions below the period gap is not particularly sensitive to the mass ratio distribution of the progenitor binary population and to the population synthesis model parameters , the quantitative description is sensitive to these inputs . in order to constrain the particular form of the distribution and binary evolutionary parameters , a treatment of the cv evolution above the period gap coupled with cv evolution below the gap as explored in this paper will be necessary . in this context ,",
    "additional constraints on the evolution are provided by the existence of the period gap and the higher mass - transfer rates for systems above the gap in comparison to those systems below the gap ( e.g. , patterson 1984 ; mcdermott & taam 1989 ; kolb & stehle 1996 ; kolb , king , & ritter 1998 ; howell , nelson , & rappaport 2001 ; townsley & bildsten 2005 ) .",
    "other comparisons of the results of our study with the observed properties of the short period cvs are possible , however the inherent faintness of the population makes such comparisons difficult to quantify . of the observed properties , donor masses have been inferred for systems in which superhump periods have been observed . for example , patterson ( 1998 ) has inferred substellar mass donors in the range of @xmath148 for 4 systems with orbital periods near the period minimum .",
    "this is somewhat lower than the masses obtained in our calculations which exceed @xmath149 near the period minimum .",
    "we note that this minimum mass is independent of the angular momentum loss treatment , although the period minimum differs between the two simulations . for a given donor star mass , systems that have evolved beyond the minimum period",
    "are furthermore characterized by a wider range of orbital periods in the case where a cb disk is present than in the case where the systemic angular momentum loss is governed by gravitational radiation and the long - term mean mass - loss rate from the system due to nova explosions only .    since the shift in the minimum period is directly affected by the angular momentum loss process , the higher mass - transfer rates promoted for the pre - and post - bounce systems are a specific prediction of our study .",
    "the greatest deviation between models with our additional angular momentum loss prescription from those with gravitational radiation and the effect of the long - term mean mass loss from the system in nova explosions are for systems near the period minimum and during the post bounce phase of evolution .",
    "the deviation in the mass - transfer rates can amount to a factor of 2 near the period minimum to an order of magnitude for post bounce systems lying near 100 minutes .",
    "the donors in these systems lose mass at rates greater than about @xmath150 .",
    "for the observed systems with rates below these values , the difference between the instantaneous mass transfer rates and the secular rates must be considered .",
    "the secular mass transfer rates determined in our evolutionary computations are generally difficult to measure in cvs , especially if they undergo dwarf nova outbursts",
    ". however , the white dwarf can be used as a diagnostic to infer the time averaged rate of mass accretion ( see townsley & bildsten 2003 ) . in this case ,",
    "compressional heating contributes to the thermal energy balance in the white dwarf envelope and the white dwarf accretors in the post bounce systems are expected to be hotter in comparison to systems evolving under the action of gravitational radiation alone .",
    "the results from our population synthesis suggest that the best strategy for discovering a cb disk below the period gap would be to target systems close to the period minimum .",
    "these will have the highest cb disk mass ( @xmath151m@xmath152 ) , temperatures ( @xmath139k ) , and radii ( @xmath153au ) .",
    "dubus et al .",
    "( 2004 ) searched for thermal cb emission in the ir for two cvs below the period gap , wz  sge ( @xmath154minutes ) and hu  aqr ( @xmath155minutes ) . for a steady - state like cb disk density profile they put upper limits on the inner disk temperature of 800  k and 1,100  k respectively",
    "the fact that these temperatures are lower than our predicted @xmath139k may suggest a radial temperature profile in which the disk departs from a steady state description .",
    "searching for narrow absorption lines may be more suited to finding cold cb material .",
    "belle et al .",
    "( 2004 ) searched for such lines in ex  hya ( @xmath156minutes ) and derived an upper limit on the column density of @xmath157  @xmath158 .",
    "although the inclination of the system is high ( @xmath159 ) it may still be insufficient to significantly probe the cold cb material , which is expected to have a very narrow and non constant flare angle .",
    "of those three systems only wz sge has a period in the range where an evolutionary important cb disk could ( statistically ) be expected .",
    "more observations of systems close to the period minimum would be useful .",
    "assuming that the additional angular momentum process is related to the existence of a cb disk , the source of its mass is likely to come directly from the donor star .",
    "although magnetically driven mass outflows at velocities less than the escape speed are possible from the outer regions of the accretion disk surrounding the wd ( proga 2003 ) , the observational fact that magnetic cvs have a similar orbital period distribution to the non magnetic cvs suggests that such outflows are not important for these systems since polars do not have inner disks . on the other hand ,",
    "equatorial mass loss from the donor may be enhanced by the mass in the region trapped by magnetic flux tubes that form closed loops in the magnetosphere ( so called dead zones ; mestel 1968 ) .",
    "this matter may be accelerated by the centrifugal effect at the high rotation rates characteristic of short period systems .",
    "since the dead zones of single stars rotating rapidly may be situated outside the outer lagrangian points of binary systems , one might plausibly anticipate additional mass loss in the equatorial plane , possibly feeding the cb disk .",
    "the amount of mass lost by the donor to such a disk may significantly exceed the overall mass in the disk ( @xmath160 ) if nova outbursts take place in the system .",
    "for the low mass - transfer rates characteristic of the systems below the period gap , it is likely that nova outbursts take place , but with long recurrence time scales ( @xmath161 yrs ) .",
    "that is , the cb disk may need to be reformed after each nova outburst . since the amount of mass required to initiate a thermonuclear runaway on an intermediate mass white dwarf of @xmath162 is @xmath163 ( townsley & bildsten 2005 ) , about 1% of this mass should lie in the cb disk . assuming that the disk is destroyed after each nova event , the rate of mass loss from the donor into the cb disk",
    "would be estimated to be in the range @xmath164 .",
    "on the other hand , if the cb disk is maintained after the nova outburst the rate of mass loss into the cb disk can be as low as @xmath165 .    to conclude",
    ", our numerical results suggest that an angular momentum loss prescription with properties similar to a cb disk provides additional ingredients to the angular momentum loss description , leading to closer agreement with the observed period distribution below the period gap than has been previously found .",
    "this results from the fact that the angular momentum loss rate is not only sufficiently enhanced above that due to gravitational radiation alone , but its rate depends on the properties of the initial binary when mass transfer is initiated during the cv phase .",
    "this leads to the result that the evolutionary tracks followed by cvs below the period gap do not converge to a common track .",
    "although other angular momentum loss processes with similar characteristics to cb disks are possible in principle , their theoretical development has not been sufficiently advanced to carry out calculations for meaningful comparisons to the observed period distribution .    in summary ,",
    "the main ingredients which allowed for a good match to the cumulative distribution function of observed cvs are the inclusion of an additional angular momentum loss mechanism which does not lead to common evolutionary tracks , which in this study is accomplished with the effect of a cb disk , a weighting factor to account for observational selection , and a flow of systems from above the period gap . in the future",
    ", we plan to investigate the orbital period distribution above the period gap .",
    "such studies are important for obtaining estimates of the ratio of systems from above to below the period gap , thus , providing a measure of the flow rate from long orbital periods to short periods .",
    "such constraints can be important for identifying the cause for the period gap .",

    "<S> the population synthesis of cataclysmic variable binary systems at short orbital periods ( @xmath0hrs ) is investigated . </S>",
    "<S> a grid of detailed binary evolutionary sequences has been calculated and included in the simulations to take account of additional angular momentum losses beyond that associated with gravitational radiation and mass loss , due to nova outbursts , from the system . as a specific example , we consider the effect of a circumbinary disk to gain insight into the ingredients necessary to reproduce the observed orbital period distribution . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting distributions show that the period minimum lies at about 80minutes with the number of systems monotonically increasing with increasing orbital period to a maximum near 90minutes . there is no evidence for an accumulation of systems at the period minimum which is a common feature of simulations in which only gravitational radiation losses are considered . </S>",
    "<S> the shift of the peak to about 90minutes is a direct result of the inclusion of systems formed within the period gap . </S>",
    "<S> the period distribution is found to be fairly flat for orbital periods ranging from about 85 to 120minutes . </S>",
    "<S> the steepness of the lower edge of the period gap can be reproduced , for example , by an input of systems at periods near 2.25hrs due to a flow of cataclysmic variable binary systems from orbital periods longer than 2.75hrs .    </S>",
    "<S> the good agreement with the cumulated distribution function of observed systems within the framework of our model indicates that the angular momentum loss by a circumbinary disk or a mechanism which mimics its features coupled with a weighting factor to account for selection effects in the discovery of such systems and a flow of systems from above the period gap to below the period gap are important ingredients for understanding the overall period distribution of cataclysmic variable binary systems . </S>"
