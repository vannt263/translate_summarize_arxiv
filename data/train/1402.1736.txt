    "in recent years , networks have gained popularity as a tool to represent , organize , and interpret phenomena arising in many fields of science , including physics , biology , social sciences , etc .",
    "questions as diverse as the structure of the world wide web , the robustness of a nation s banking system or its power grid , or the mechanism of functions inside a cell can be expressed in terms of networks .",
    "these applications have led to networks whose structure and complexity have gone far beyond the examples studied before in the classical computer science literature . driven partly by the emergence of these new applications ,",
    "research in network science has also undergone a revolutionary change in recent years .",
    "while traditional network science was basically a subject of graph theory and focused on networks with rather simple structure , recent studies often took the viewpoint of treating networks as complex systems , and used tools and concepts from statistical mechanics .",
    "while the structure and topology of networks has been under much investigation , the dynamics on the network is less well understood despite the fact that it leads to important and nontrivial questions .",
    "for example , any network with positive - weighted edges defines a markov jump process ( mjp ) ( and vice versa ) and in many applications , it is of interest to understand the interplay between the network structure and the dynamics of this mjp .",
    "our aim here is to address such questions within the framework of transition path theory ( tpt ) , originally introduced in  @xcite ( see also @xcite for reviews ) and already used in  @xcite in the context of networks and mjps  the present work can be viewed as a continuation of this last paper . in a nutshell , the basic idea in tpt is to single out two specific sets of nodes and analyze the statistical properties of the reactive trajectories by which transitions between these sets occur  if the sets are chosen appropriately , this permits to extract the most salient features of the dynamics on the network and relate them to its topology .",
    "this is like probing an electrical network by wiring it at different locations and analyzing how the current flow from the nodes wired positively to those wired negatively  @xcite .",
    "tpt is also related to the potential - theoretic approach to metastability championed by bovier and collaborators  @xcite , albeit the emphases of both approaches are different .",
    "the potential - theoretic approach has been introduced as a theoretical tool to obtain rigorous bounds on the low - lying eigenvalues that characterize the slowest relaxation phenomena in mjps displaying metastability  @xcite .",
    "tpt on the other hand permits to characterize exactly the statistical properties of the transition pathways on complex networks that are not necessarily metastable , or such that the low - lying part of their spectrum is too complicated to be estimated analytically .",
    "importantly tpt can also be used as a computational tool in such situations . by being able to analyze the flow of transitions between specific parts of the network , for example by generating numerically reactive trajectories by which these transitions occur , or even no - detour transitions paths , and analyzing their statistical properties",

    "we refer to them as fcc and ico , respectively.,title=\"fig:\",height=188 ]    to make this last point and illustrate the usefulness of the tools developed in this paper , we will apply them to analyze the network developed by david wales and collaborators to model the dynamics of lennard - jones clusters with 38 atoms ( @xmath0 )  @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 is a prototypical example illustrating how the complexity of a system s energy landscape ( and its associated network ) affects its dynamical properties , a feature that is also observed in other complex phenomena such as protein folding or glassy dynamics .",
    "@xmath0 has a double - funnel landscape : its global minimum , a face - centered - cubic truncated octahedron , lies at the bottom of one funnel , whereas its second lowest minimum , an incomplete mackay icosahedron , lies at the bottom of the other ( see fig .  [ fcc_ico ] ) .",
    "the deeper octahedral funnel is also narrower , and believed to be mostly inaccessible from the liquid state .",
    "thus , when @xmath0 self - assembles by crystallization , it does so by reaching the bottom of the shallow but broader isocahedral funnel , and an interesting question is how does @xmath0 manage to subsequently find its ground state structure by travelling from the shallow funnel to the deep one ?",
    "this question of rearrangement is the one that we will address below .",
    "it is made complicated by the ruggedness of the energy landscape of @xmath0 , which has an enormous number of local minima separated by a hierarchy of barriers of different heights .",

    "[ sec : tpt ] we summarize the main outputs of tpt . in sec .",
    "[ sec : current ] we introduce sampling tools based on the theory . in sec .",
    "[ sec : metastable ] we discuss the case of metastable networks , and establish connections between tpt and the potential theoretic approach to metastability as well as large deviation theory that arise in these situations . in sec .",
    "[ sec : lj38 ] we apply the tools introduced earlier to analyze the rearrangement of the @xmath0 network . finally , some concluding remarks are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : lj38 ] .",
    "tpt for networks and markov jump processes ( mjps ) is discussed in detail in  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) . here",
    "we give a brief summary of the theory , then discuss algorithms based on it that can be used to characterize the flows on the network .",
    "we also comment on the connections between tpt and spectral approaches to network analysis , bovier s potential theoretic approach to metastability in mjps , and large deviation theory .",
    "we will consider mjps on a countable state - space @xmath4 with infinitesimal generator @xmath5 : @xmath6 where @xmath7 for @xmath8 denotes the probability that the process jumps from state @xmath9 to state @xmath10 in the infinitesimal time interval @xmath11 $ ] .",
    "any such mjp is equivalent to a network which we denote by @xmath12 : the set @xmath4 of states of the mjp is the set of nodes in the network , and @xmath13 is the set of edges , i.e. the set of ordered pairs @xmath14 with @xmath15 such that @xmath16 .",
    "conversely , any network with positive weighted edges is equivalent to an mjp by interpreting the weights on these edges as off - diagonal entries of the mjp generator .",
    "we assume that the generator is irreducible and that the mjp is ergodic with respect to the equilibrium probability distribution @xmath17 satisfying @xmath18 for simplicity , we also assume that the mjp is time - reversible , i.e. that the detailed balance property holds @xmath19 we denote by @xmath20 the instantaneous position of the mjp and following standard conventions we assume that the function @xmath21 is right - continuous with left limits ( _ cdlg _ ) .",
    "tpt is a framework to understand the mechanism by which transitions from any subset @xmath22 to any disjoint subset @xmath23 occur in the mjp .",
    "specifically , tpt analyzes the statistical properties of the _ reactive trajectories _ by which these transitions occur : if @xmath24 denotes an infinitely long equilibrium trajectory of the mjp , the reactive trajectories associated with it are the successive pieces of @xmath24 during which it has last left @xmath25 and is on its way to @xmath26 next .",
    "tpt gives explicit expressions for the probability distribution of the reactive trajectories , their probability current , their rate of occurrence , etc .",
    "besides the equilibrium probability distribution @xmath27 and the generator @xmath28 , the expressions for these quantities involve the committor @xmath29 , defined as the probability that the process starting at a state @xmath30 will first reach  @xmath26 rather than  @xmath25 : @xmath31 where @xmath32 denotes the first hitting time of set  @xmath33 starting from @xmath9 : @xmath34 the committor is also known as equilibrium potential of the capacitor @xmath35 , and is denoted by @xmath36 in the collection of works of bovier _ et al . _ ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it satisfies @xmath37 and it can be used to estimate various statistical descriptors of the reactive trajectories .",
    "for example , the equilibrium probability to find the process in state @xmath9 and that it be reactive  which is called the _ probability distribution of reactive trajectories _  is given by @xmath38 indeed , the equilibrium probability to find the trajectory in  @xmath9 is @xmath39 , and the probability that it is reactive , is the product between @xmath40 , which gives the probability that it will reach  @xmath26 rather than  @xmath25 next , and @xmath41 , which by time - reversibility gives the probability that it came from  @xmath25 rather than  @xmath26 last .",
    "note that @xmath42 is only non - zero if @xmath43 .",
    "note also that this distribution is not normalized to one : the quantity @xmath44 gives the probability that the trajectory be reactive ( i.e. the proportion of time it spends traveling from @xmath25 to @xmath26 at equilibrium ) , and the probability to find the trajectory at state @xmath9 at equilibrium conditional on it being reactive is @xmath45 .",
    "similarly , we can calculate the average number of transitions per unit time that the reactive trajectories make from state  @xmath9 to state  @xmath46 : @xmath47 the additional factor @xmath48 beside the usual @xmath49 accounts for the requirement that , in order to be reactive , the trajectory must have reached  @xmath9 coming from  @xmath25 last and it must reach  @xmath26 next after leaving  @xmath10 . by antisymmetrizing  @xmath50",
    "we obtain the _ _ probability current of reactive trajectories _ _ : @xmath51 this current is key to understand the mechanism of the reaction as it permits to locate the productive channels by which this reaction occurs  in contrast , both   and   indicate where the reactive trajectories go , but these locations may include many dynamical traps and/or deadends that these trajectories visit but do not contribute to their current towards  @xmath26 .",
    "we will elaborate on these points in sec .",
    "[ sec : current ] .",
    "the current   also permits to calculate the average number of transitions per unit time as the total current out of  @xmath25 or into  @xmath26 : @xmath52 this quantity is referred to as the _ reaction rate _ and it can also be expressed as @xmath53 follows from the detailed balance condition   and the conservation of the current ( theorem 2.13 in @xcite ) : @xmath54 for all @xmath55 .",
    "the reaction rate  @xmath56 should not be confused with the rates @xmath57 and @xmath58 defined respectively as the inverse of the average time it takes the trajectory to go back to @xmath26 after hitting @xmath25 or back to @xmath25 after hitting @xmath26 .",
    "these rates are given by @xmath59 where @xmath60 are the proportions of time such that the trajectory last hit  @xmath25 or  @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "in this section we show how the outputs of tpt can be used to understand the mechanism of the transitions from @xmath25 to @xmath26 .",
    "if we want to know where these trajectories go , this can be done by analyzing and  .",
    "some of the locations visited by the reactive trajectories may be deadends , however , in the sense that not much current goes through them . in order to determine the productive paths ( in term of probability current ) taken by the reactive trajectories , we need to analyze the current  .",
    "some tools to perform this analysis were already introduced in  @xcite .",
    "for example , it was shown how to identify a dominant representative path , in the sense that this path maximizes the current it carries .",
    "while such a path can be informative about the mechanism of the reaction , it can also be misleading in situations where the probability current of reactive trajectories is supported on many paths which carry little current individually  in other words , in situations where the reaction channel is spread out . here",
    "we introduce tools that are appropriate in these situations as well , since we expect them to be quite generic in complex networks .",
    "specifically , we provide ways to generate directly reactive trajectories that flow from  @xmath25 to  @xmath26 without even returning to  @xmath25 , or even trajectories that only take productive steps towards @xmath26 .",
    "the statistical analysis of these trajectories then provides ways to analyze the flows in the network , which we also discuss .",
    "the following technical assumptions will be used below to simplify the discussion :    * _ @xmath61 if @xmath62 and @xmath63 , i.e. the mjp can not jump directly from @xmath25 to @xmath26  with this condition , every reactive trajectory visits at least one state outside of @xmath64 .",
    "_ * _ @xmath65 and @xmath66 if @xmath67 .",
    "_ * _ @xmath68",
    "if @xmath15 and @xmath69 . _    it is straightforward to generalize the statements in propositions  [ th : tpp ] and  [ th : lftpp ] below to situations where these assumptions do not hold , as indicated in the proofs , but it makes them slightly more involved .",
    "our first result is a proposition that indicates how to generate reactive trajectories directly .",
    "the main idea is to lump onto an artificial state  @xmath70 all the pieces of the trajectory in the original mjp during which it is not reactive .",
    "we call the process obtained this way the transition path process , following the terminology introduced in  @xcite , where a similar construction was made in the context of diffusions :    [ th : tpp ] suppose that assumptions  ( a ) and ( b ) hold , let @xmath71 , and consider the process on the state - space @xmath72 defined by the generator with off - diagonal entries given by @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the probability that the trajectory is reactive ( see eq .  )",
    ". then this process has the same law as the one obtained from the original mjp by mapping every non - reactive piece of its trajectory onto state  @xmath70 .",
    "in particular , on @xmath75 the invariant probability distribution of the transition path process coincides with the probability distribution of the reactive trajectories given in  , and the average number of transition per unit time that the transition path process makes between states in @xmath75 is given by   and the associated current by  .",
    "the proof of this proposition is given at the end of this section .",
    "note that we can supplement the transition path process with the information that when it jumps to @xmath76 from @xmath70 , it comes from state @xmath62 with probability @xmath77 and when it jumps to  @xmath70 from @xmath78 , it reaches state @xmath63 with probability @xmath79 with this information added , the invariant probability current of the transition - path process is the same as the one in   of the reactive trajectories even if we include edges that come out of  @xmath25 or into  @xmath26 .    by construction , in the transition path process ( like in the reactive trajectories it represents ) , the trajectories go from @xmath25 to @xmath26 directly , without ever returning to @xmath25 in between  in the transition path process , these returns arise through visits to state  @xmath70 . in contrast , if we were to simply turn @xmath25 into a source and @xmath26 into a sink , the process one would obtain could take many steps to travel from @xmath25 to @xmath26 because it could revisit @xmath25 often before making an actual transition  this problem is especially acute if @xmath25 and @xmath26 are metastable states since , by definition , @xmath25 is then revisited often before a transition to @xmath26 occurs ( more on metastability in sec .",
    "[ sec : metastable ] ) . in such situations ,",
    "the reactive trajectories are much shorter since by construction they only contain this last transitioning piece",
    ". it should be stressed , however , that the reactive trajectories could still take many steps to travel from  @xmath25 to @xmath26 and be complicated themselves .",
    "for example if the transition mechanism involves dynamical traps or deadends along the way , the reactive trajectories will wander a long time in the region between  @xmath25 and  @xmath26 before finally making their way to  @xmath26 .    in such situations , it is convenient to construct a process that carries the same probability current as the reactive trajectories , but makes no detour to go from  @xmath25 to  @xmath26 . by this",
    "we mean the following : if we look at the way the committor function varies along a reactive trajectory , it will start at 0 in  @xmath25 and go to 1 in  @xmath26 , but it will not necessarily increase monotonically between these values along the way .",
    "let us call the pieces of the reactive trajectories along which the committor increases the productive pieces , in the sense that they are the ones that bring these trajectories closer to the product  @xmath26 , whereas they make a detour along any other piece .",
    "imagine patching together these productive pieces in such a way that the resulting process is markov and carries the same probability current as the reactive trajectories .",
    "it turns out that there is a precise way to do so , and this defines what we call the no - detour transition path process :    [ th : lftpp ] suppose that assumptions ( a ) , ( b ) , and  ( c ) hold , let @xmath80 and consider the process on the state - space @xmath81 defined by the generator with off - diagonal entries @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84",
    ". then this process has the same stationary current as the transition path process , but the committor function increases monotonically along each of its paths on @xmath75 . in particular , these paths have no loops .",
    "the proof of this proposition is given at the end of this section .",
    "processes similar to the one in this proposition were introduced in @xcite .",
    "note that the equivalent of the no - detour transition path process for diffusions is somewhat trivial since the ` no - detour ' trajectories in this context are simply the flowlines of the probability current of reactive trajectories , which are deterministic .",
    "note also that we can again supplement this process with the information that when it jumps to @xmath76 from @xmath70 , it comes from state @xmath62 with probability  , and when it jumps to  @xmath70 from @xmath85 , it reaches state @xmath63 with probability  .",
    "propositions  [ th : tpp ] and [ th : lftpp ] can be used to generate reactive trajectories and no - detour reactive trajectories , which can then be analyzed using a variety of statistical tools to characterize the mechanism of the reaction .",
    "how to do so in practice will be illustrated on the example of @xmath0 in sec .",
    "[ sec : lj38 ] .",

    "for @xmath76 we have @xmath91 using the detailed balance condition , @xmath92 , a few terms cancel out and we are left with @xmath93 where we used @xmath94 if @xmath62 and @xmath95 if @xmath96 , and the last equality follows from the definition of the committor .    for @xmath90 we have @xmath97 which terminates the proof .",
    "note that if assumption ( a ) does not hold , then we also need to account for the direct jumps from @xmath25 to @xmath26 in the original mjp as additional visits into state  @xmath70 .",

    ", the proposition is valid .",
    "the fact that the process has no loops follows directly from the form of its generator  in particular the network defined by @xmath99 , @xmath100 , has no loops except for the ones through  @xmath70 . the proof of the rest of the statement is similar to that of proposition  [ th : tpp ] : under assumptions  ( b ) and ( c ) , the generator @xmath99 is irreducible because @xmath28 is and we will show that the invariant distribution in the network with the generator @xmath101 in   is equal to @xmath102 so that the average number of transitions per unit time it makes between any pair of states , that is , @xmath103 , is @xmath104 this will imply that the transition path process and the no - detour transition path process have the same stationary current , as claimed in the proposition .    to show that   is the invariant distribution , we consider again two cases : @xmath76 and @xmath90 . if @xmath76 we have @xmath105 using the detailed balance condition , @xmath92 , and the fact that @xmath106 we obtain @xmath107 where we used @xmath94 if @xmath62 and @xmath95 if @xmath96 , and the last equality follows from the definition of the committor .",
    "for @xmath90 we have @xmath108 which ends the proof .",
    "to remove assumption ( a ) , we need to account for the direct jumps from @xmath25 to @xmath26 in the original mjp as additional visits into state  @xmath70 . to remove assumption ( b ) , we can fatten the states @xmath25 and @xmath26 to include into them all the nodes  @xmath9 such that @xmath94 and @xmath98 , respectively . and to remove assumption ( c ) , we can restrict the statement of the proposition to the unique ergodic component of the chain with generator   composed of all the states in  @xmath75 that can be reached starting from @xmath25 .",
    "recall that a cut in a network @xmath109 is a partition of the nodes in  @xmath4 into two disjoint subsets that are joint by at least one edge in  @xmath13 .",
    "the set of edges whose endpoints are in different subsets of the partition is referred to as the cut - set . here",

    "the edges of the cut - set are shown with dashed lines.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    we can use cuts to characterize the width of the transition tube carrying the current of reactive trajectories .",
    "a specific set of cuts is convenient for this purpose , namely the family of isocommittor cuts which are such that their cut - set @xmath33 is given by @xmath113 the isocommittor cuts are the counterparts of the isocommittor surfaces in the continuous case .",
    "these cuts are special because if @xmath114 and @xmath115 , the reactive current between these nodes is nonnegative , @xmath116 , which also means that every no - detour transition path contains exactly one edge belonging to an isocommittor cut since the committor increases monotonically along these transition paths .",
    "therefore , we can sort the edges in the isocommittor cut @xmath117 according to the reactive current they carry , in descending order , and find the minimal number of edges @xmath118 carrying at least @xmath119% of this current . by doing so for each value of the committor @xmath120 and for different values of the percentage @xmath121 , one",

    "the result of this procedure will also be illustrated on the example of @xmath0 in sec .",

    "in this section , we briefly discuss the case of metastable networks .",
    "we start by giving a spectral definition of metastability , then discuss the connections of our results to the potential theoretic approach to metastability and to large deviation theory .",
    "metastable networks and mjps have been the subject of many studies ( e.g.  @xcite ) . by definition , they are such that the spectrum of their generator contains one or more groups of low - lying eigenvalues .",
    "let us assume without loss of generality that @xmath123 or @xmath124 and denote by @xmath125 the solutions of the eigenvalue equation @xmath126 then the detailed balance condition   implies that the eigenvalues are real , non - negative , and can be ordered as @xmath127 there is a low - lying group of eigenvalues if there exists a @xmath128 and an @xmath129 such that @xmath130 to see that this condition implies metastability , notice that the spectral decomposition of the generator , @xmath131 leads to the following expression for the transition probability distribution @xmath132 to find the walker at state  @xmath10 at time  @xmath133 if it was at  @xmath9 initially : @xmath134 if holds , it means that on time - scales such that @xmath135 in @xmath136 , we have @xmath137 , and up to errors that are exponentially small in @xmath138 , the sum in   can effectively be truncated at @xmath139 : @xmath140 in other words , on these time scales the fast processes described by the eigenvalues of index @xmath141 and above have already relaxed to equilibrium and what remains are the slow processes associated with the eigenvalues of index @xmath139 and below .",
    "this also means that the dynamics on these time scales can effectively be reduced to a markov jump processes on a state space with @xmath141 states .",
    "note that the spectral decomposition in   also leads to a spectral decomposition for the current : @xmath142 where the eigencurrent associated with the pair @xmath143 is @xmath144      the eigencurrent   should be compared to  : as can be seen , can be obtained from by substituting the eigenvector @xmath145 for the committor  @xmath40 .",
    "this suggests that if @xmath146 and corresponds to an eigencurrent associated with a slow process in the low - lying group , then it should be possible to find sets @xmath25 and @xmath26 such that the current of reactive trajectories @xmath147 between these two sets approximates @xmath148 .",
    "this is indeed the case , and this observation is at the heart of the potential theoretic approach to metastability developed by bovier and collaborators  @xcite . in a nutshell , this approach says that , up to shifting and scaling , any low lying eigenvector @xmath149 can be approximated by the committor function for the reaction between two suitably chosen sets @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "this observation is useful for analysis because it permits to focus on a specific eigenfunction / eigenvalue pair by studying the variational problem that the committor satisfies , that is , by minimizing the dirichlet form associated with the generator  @xmath28 : @xmath150 over all @xmath151 subject to the boundary conditions that @xmath152 if @xmath62 and @xmath153 if @xmath96 .",

    "the discussion above makes a ( brief ) connection between the potential theoretic approach to metastability and tpt .",
    "in fact , tpt gives a way to reinterpret the various objects used in the potential theoretic approach in terms of exact statistical descriptors of the reactive trajectories .",
    "this reinterpretation is interesting because tpt applies regardless on whether the system is metastable or not .",
    "in other words , all of the formulas given in secs .  [ sec : react ] and  [ sec : current ] are exact no matter what the sets  @xmath25 and  @xmath26 are .",
    "this has the advantage that we can use the tools of tpt to analyze reactions even in situations where does not necessarily hold .",
    "more generally , our emphasis is different : we are mainly interested in using tpt to compute numerically the pathways for a reaction of interest between sets that are known before hand , rather than estimating analytically the low lying part of the spectrum . indeed",
    ", while this second goal rapidly becomes out of reach in practice for complex systems ( and typically require to make specific assumptions about the network like e.g. the ones discussed in sec .  [ sec : ldt ] below ) , the first one remains achievable in a much broader class of situations , as will be illustrated in sec .",

    "we will focus on a sub - case of the one investigated by wentzell which is relevant in the context of @xmath0 , namely , when the generator of the mjp is of the form @xmath158 where @xmath159 , @xmath160 , @xmath161 and @xmath162 are parameters .",

    ", in general there are as many low - lying groups of eigenvalues as there are states ( i.e. @xmath170 as @xmath157 for all @xmath171 ) , and wentzell s approach provides a way to estimate each of these eigenvalues .",
    "to see how , it is convenient to organize the states of the chain on a disconnectivity graph , that is , a downward facing tree in which each node @xmath30 lies at the end of a branch at a depth equal to its energy @xmath162 , and branches in the tree are connected at the lowest energy barrier @xmath172 that connect all the nodes on one side of the tree to those on the other side  a cartoon example is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:7well ] : because this will be relevant in our analysis of @xmath0 , in this example we start from a continuous energy landscape that we convert into a network whose disconnectivity graph is then obtained from its minimal spanning tree ( bottom right , all solid edges ) calculated using e.g. kruskal s algorithm ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the eigenvalues can then be estimated recursively from the disconnectivity graph as follows : start by identifying the lowest barrier in the tree , i.e. the adjacent pair @xmath173 on the tree such that @xmath174 is minimum over all @xmath175 .",
    "the node @xmath176 identifies the well that the system can escape by crossing the barrier of minimum height , and the largest eigenvalue in the system corresponds to the inverse of the time scale of this escape , i.e. it can then be estimated as @xmath177 where the symbol @xmath178 means that the ratio of the logarithms of both sides of this equality tends to 1 as @xmath157 .",
    "now remove the node @xmath176 and its branch from the tree , and repeat the construction : that is , in the new tree find the pair @xmath179 such that @xmath180 is minimum over all @xmath181 , to obtain an estimate for the next largest eigenvalue , @xmath182 . by iterating upon this procedure , in @xmath183 steps",

    "after @xmath183 steps in the procedure we end up with a degenerate tree made of a single node lying at the very bottom of the original tree ( and of course we already know that @xmath189 ) .",
    "note that in the discussion above , we assumed that the barriers @xmath190 identified along the way are all different ( that is , strictly increasing with @xmath191 ) , which is the generic case and leads to eigenvalues that are all well - separated : if some of these barriers are equal , it means that some of the eigenvalues are asymptotically equivalent , and this case can be treated as well by generalizing the construction above .",
    "note also that estimates more precise than   and can be obtained using the potential theoretic / tpt approach : in the present situation , at any stage in the iteration procedure , the states  @xmath192 and  @xmath193 are those that should be set as  @xmath25 and  @xmath26 , respectively .",

    ", the decomposition into cycles simplifies , as was recently discussed in  @xcite .",
    "here we summarize this discussion and refer the interested reader to the original paper for details .    in a nutshell ,",
    "the decomposition into cycles focuses on which states are most likely to be reached from a given state : in the zero temperature limit , if the system is in state @xmath9 , with probability one it will reach next the state connected to @xmath9 by the smallest barrier , i.e. @xmath194 searching consecutively for the next most likely state defines a dynamics on the network that generically ends with cycles made of two states : each of these cycles contain a local minimum of energy on the disconnectivity graph ( that is , a state at the bottom of a group of branches on the tree ) , and the state connected to this minimum by the lowest barrier .",
    "these cycles are called 1-cycles by freidlin .",
    "once we have identified them , we can remove from the tree the state with highest energy in each of these 1-cycles , and repeat the construction iteratively .",
    "these gives 2-cycles , 3-cycles , etc .",
    "until we again end up with a tree with only 2 nodes on it . in this construction , we can also keep the information about the state in the original network by which any @xmath195-cycle is exited : with probability 1 as @xmath157 , this is the state whose barrier is the lowest to escape all the states contained in this @xmath195-cycle .",
    "a corollary of the fact that cycles are exited in a predictable way is that , between any two nodes in the network taken as sets @xmath25 and @xmath26 , there exists a single path on the network that concentrates all the current of the reactive trajectories as @xmath157 .",
    "this path has a minmax property : the maximal barrier separating every pair of states @xmath9 and @xmath10 on the path is minimal among the maximal barriers along all paths in the network connecting @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( see fig .  [ fig:7well ] for an illustration ) .    in  @xcite",
    ", the construction of the hierarchy of freidlin s cycles was performed via a sequence of conversions of rate matrices into jump matrices followed by taking limits @xmath196 .",
    "relying on the properties of the hierarchy of cycles specific for the systems with detailed balance , an efficient dijkstra - based algorithm was also proposed for computing the minmax path .",
    "importantly , this algorithm did not built the whole hierarchy of cycles , but only computed the sub - hierarchy relevant to the transition process of interest , and did not require any pre - processing of the stochastic network .",
    "we conclude this section on ldt with a remark .",
    "as explained above , the ldt picture applies in the limit when @xmath157 , in which case the hierarchy of different barriers in the disconnectivity graph corresponds to timescales that become infinitely far apart as @xmath157 .",
    "while this picture is indeed correct at extremely low temperature , we do not expect it to remain valid as the temperature is increased , even if the system does remain strongly metastable ( i.e. such that some low - lying groups of eigenvalue do persist ) .",
    "rather , we expect that the transition channel will rapidly broaden if the networks is large , and that the mechanism of the reaction wil depart from that predicted by ldt .",
    "our analysis of @xmath0 by tpt will indeed confirm this picture .",

    "this dynamics is extremely complicated owing to the multiscale nature of this potential which , when @xmath199 is large ( e.g. @xmath203 as we will consider below ) possesses an enormous number of local minima separated by a hierarchy of barriers of various height .",
    "a few thermodynamic properties of these clusters are known , however .",
    "first , it is known that the majority of global potential energy minima for lennard - jones clusters of various sizes involve an icosahedral packing @xcite . however , lennard - jones clusters with special numbers of atoms admit a high symmetry configuration based on a face - centered cubic packing , with a lower energy .",
    "the smallest cluster with this property contains @xmath203 atoms@xcite .",
    "the global potential energy minimum of the @xmath0 cluster is achieved by a truncated octahedron with the point group @xmath2 ( fig .  [ fcc_ico ] ( a ) ) , which from now on we will simply refer to as fcc .",
    "the second lowest minimum is the icosahedral structure with the @xmath3 point group ( fig .",
    "[ fcc_ico ] ( b ) ) , which we will refer to as ico .",
    "it is also known that the basin around ico is much wider than that around fcc  these two basins are usually referred to as funnels in the literature .",
    "this has thermodynamic consequences when the temperature of the system is non - zero .",
    "indeed , the fcc basin only remains the preferred basin for @xmath204 with @xmath205 ( here @xmath206 denotes boltzmann constant ) . at @xmath207 ,",
    "the system undergoes a solid - solid phase transition where the ico basin becomes more likely due to its with greater configurational entropy ( see e.g. fig . 4 in @xcite ) .",
    "next , at @xmath208 , the outer layer of the cluster melts , while the core remains solid .",
    "then the cluster completely melts at @xmath209 @xcite .",
    "the difference of widths of the two basins also has dynamical consequences . indeed , due to its larger width , the ico basin is the one that is most likely to be reached by the system after crystallization even if @xmath210 .",
    "the question then becomes how does the system reorganize itself to get out of the dynamical trap around ico and in its preferred state around fcc ?",
    "it is also of interest to understand how this process is influenced by the temperature , since the rearrangement pathway is likely to be influenced by it .",
    "these are the type of questions that we will address in this section , as an illustration of the tpt - based network analysis tools presented earlier .",
    "this study is complementary to those conducted by wales and collaborators in the same context  @xcite using different tools  @xcite .",
    "the problem of rearrangement of @xmath0 has been the object of much studies in the past 15 years ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "an interesting approach to the problem has been proposed by david wales and collaborators , who undertook an ambitious program aiming at mapping the evolution of @xmath0 onto a network / mjp and reducing the analysis of the dynamics of @xmath0 to the study of this network . while this mapping is technically hard to perform in practice and required a lot of inventiveness , it is conceptually quite simple to understand .",
    "if the temperature of the system is small enough , it will spend a long time near the bottom of the energy well around the local minima it is currently in before a thermal fluctuation large enough will manage to push it above an energy barrier separating it from an adjacent well . the system will then fall near the bottom of this adjacent well and the process will repeat . in this regime , the dynamics can be reduced to a basin hoping : the local minima of the energy become the nodes on the network , two such nodes are connected by an edge if the system can transit from one minimum to the another by crossing a single barrier , and the rate / weight of the directed edge from one node to another involves ( via arhennius formula ) the height of the energy barrier(s ) that must be crossed to perform this transition  this construction was illustrated on a toy example in fig .",
    "[ fig:7well ] .",
    "an additional simplification made in the case of @xmath0 is to lump together all the minima and saddle point that are equivalent by symmetry ( point group , permutation , etc . ) .",
    "all together this construction led to a network for @xmath0 that contains a single connected component with 71887 nodes associated with the lowest local minima on the landscape ( which include fcc and ico ) , and 119853 edges  this information is publicly available from the @xmath0 database wales s website  @xcite .",
    "the database also contains the information about the generator , whose off - diagonal entries are in a form consistent with  @xcite @xmath211 here @xmath212 is proportional to the inverse of the system s temperature @xmath213 , @xmath214 , @xmath162 , and @xmath215 are , respectively , the point group order , the value of the potential energy , and the geometric mean vibrational frequency for the local minimum associated with node  @xmath9 , @xmath216 , @xmath217 and @xmath218 are the same numbers for the transition state @xmath191 connecting the local minima @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( there may be more than one of them for every pair @xmath14 adjacent on the network ) , and @xmath219 is the number of vibrational degrees of freedom .",
    "as in  , if there is no minimum energy path connecting the minima with index @xmath9 and @xmath10 via a single saddle point , we set @xmath220 and @xmath221 .",

    "the majority of local minima / nodes listed in wales database do not have special names  for example , fcc and ico are simply listed 1st and 7th , respectively . except for these two , in the sequel we will simply refer to the other minima by their indices in the database .",
    "we also work in reduced units in which the temperature is measured in units of @xmath223 . since we are interested in the mechanism of rearrangement between ico and fcc , we take the nodes of these two states as sets @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "we also checked that our results do not change significantly if we fatten these states by including in them the nodes that are in the connected component around them where all the nodes have energy within @xmath224 of that of fcc and ico , respectively .      a key preliminary step in the application of tpt to @xmath0",
    "is the calculation of the committor function .",
    "this calculation requires solving which , in the present case , is a system of @xmath225 linear equations with the same number of unknowns .",
    "the detailed balance property   allows us to make the matrix in symmetric by multiplying each row by @xmath226 .",
    "the resulting system can then be solved using the conjugate gradient method with the incomplete cholesky preconditioning ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",

    "[ fig : cartoon1 ] , at @xmath260 , most of the current concentrate on a single path : this path coincides with the minmax path between ico and fcc predicted by ldt  @xcite . at the higher temperature of @xmath234 , however , we see that this minmax path becomes mostly irrelevant , and in fact we can no longer go from ico to fcc following edges that carry at least 10@xmath261 of the current .",
    "the reason is that the current becomes very spread out among the edges of the network , indicative that the tube carrying most of the current of reactive trajectories also becomes quite wide .    to quantify further this observation",
    ", we used proposition  [ th : lftpp ] to generate @xmath262 samples of the no - detour transition path process at every temperature .",
    "( in the present example , it turns out that the network is so complex that the reactive trajectories themselves , which we can in principle generate via proposition  [ th : tpp ] , are too long to be sampled efficiently .",

    "as can be seen , at the low temperature of @xmath260 , this distribution is very peaked around the value @xmath264 , which is the height of the lowest saddle point separating ico and fcc . at higher temperatures ,",
    "however , this distribution broadens significantly , indicative that higher barriers become frequently crossed by the no - detour transition paths .",
    "this is an entropic effect : in essence , we can think of the height of the barrier in terms of ` bonds ' between the lennard - jones particles that need to be broken for the rearrangement to proceed .",
    "what our results show is that the number of no - detour paths increases very rapidly with the maximal number of bonds that are ever broken along them . at low temperature ,",
    "the rearrangement proceed mostly by no - detour paths along which no more than about 4 bounds are broken , because these paths are energetically favorable . at higher temperature , however",
    ", no - detour paths along which 5 , 6 or even 7 bonds break start to matter : even though they are less favorable energetically , their sheer number means that they eventually carry more current globally .",
    "a consequence of this effect is that the width of the reaction channel also broadens significantly with temperature .",

    "[ fig : fluxincut ] , where we analyze the current along the edges in the isocommittor cut @xmath265 . by ordering these edges by the magnitude of the current they carry , and plotting this current magnitude as a function of the edge index , we arrive at the plots on the main panel of fig .",

    "we also faded the color as this magnitude decreased .",
    "finally , we used dots of different sizes to represent the nodes : the bigger the node , the larger is the magnitude of the average number of transitions per unit time that the reactive trajectories make through this node , see .",
    "this is a way to try to capture deadends and dynamical traps on the network , i.e. node that the reactive trajectories visit often but through which little current of these reactive trajectories go . in the figures these deadends are nodes that are high and big .",

    "<S> a set of analytical and computational tools based on transition path theory ( tpt ) is proposed to analyze flows in complex networks . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , tpt is used to study the statistical properties of the reactive trajectories by which transitions occur between specific groups of nodes on the network . </S>",
    "<S> sampling tools are built upon the outputs of tpt that allow to generate these reactive trajectories directly , or even transition paths that travel from one group of nodes to the other without making any detour and carry the same probability current as the reactive trajectories . </S>",
    "<S> these objects permit to characterize the mechanism of the transitions , for example by quantifying the width of the tubes by which these transitions occur , the location and distribution of their dynamical bottlenecks , etc . </S>",
    "<S> these tools are applied to a network modeling the dynamics of the lennard - jones cluster with 38 atoms ( @xmath0 ) and used to understand the mechanism by which this cluster rearranges itself between its two most likely states at various temperatures . </S>"
