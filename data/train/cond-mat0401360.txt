    "the methods developed in studying complex physical systems have been successfully applied throughout decades to analyze financial data @xcite .",
    "the quantitative study of financial data continue to attract the growing interest motivated by the existence of universal features in the dynamics of different markets , such as power - law tails of the return distributions @xcite , scaling as a first approximation @xcite and deviations from scaling of the empirical return distributions @xcite , volatility clustering @xcite , and leverage effect @xcite .",
    "the phenomenological and microscopic models @xcite have been proposed to explain the established stylized facts .",
    "the field of research connected to modeling financial markets has been named econophysics .",
    "a stock s volatility represents the simplest measure of its riskiness or uncertainty .",
    "formally , the volatility is the annualized standard deviation of the stock s returns during the period of interest .",
    "the random walk model proposed by bachelier in 1900 year @xcite presupposes a constant volatility .",
    "there is an ample empirical evidence , however , that the volatility is not a constant , but represents a random variable .",
    "two well established stylized facts concerning the volatility are long ranged volatility - volatility correlations that are also known as volatility clustering @xcite and return - volatility correlations that are also known as leverage effect @xcite .",
    "the volatility is a key variable to control risk measures associated with the dynamics of prices of financial assets .",
    "the implied volatility extracted from options prices represents a market estimate of future volatility . a pure exposure to future volatility is provided by the volatility swaps @xcite .",
    "the volatility enters all options pricing models , so its knowledge has a great value for estimate of the equilibrium options state - price distributions .",
    "the volatility clustering manifests itself in the occurrence of large changes of the index at neighboring times ( observed localized outbursts ) .",
    "the leverage effect has its origin in the observed negative correlation between the past returns and future volatility .",
    "the possible explanation to this effect @xcite is due to the fact that negative returns increase financial leverage and extend the risk for investors and thereby a stock s volatility .",
    "a statistical study @xcite demonstrates clearly that the leverage effect is one - directional : past returns correlate with future volatility only .    in this paper",
    ", we propose an analytical method to evaluate future volatility as a linear function of the lagged volatility and lagged returns .",
    "the method takes the volatility clustering and leverage effect into account and provides for stationary stochastic processes the smallest forecasting error in the class of all linear functions . in this precise sense",
    ", we talk on the best linear forecast ( blf ) of the volatility .",
    "the blf problem for a stationary stochastic process was formulated and solved by kolmogorov @xcite in 1941 year and wiener @xcite in 1949 year .",
    "a modern review of the blf methods can be found in ref .",
    "we apply these methods to construct the blf volatility function for the dow jones 30 industrial average ( djia ) .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in the next sect . , we remove the leverage effect from the original time series to work with a reduced volatility @xmath0 that has by definition a vanishing covariance with the past returns .",
    "the spectral density of a stochastic process can be factorized , @xmath1 if its correlation function represents a superposition of the exponential functions .",
    "an explicit expression is derived for the amplitude @xmath2 .",
    "the analytical properties of the amplitude @xmath2 in the complex @xmath3-plane are important to provide an explicit representation of the predictor function . in sect .",
    "3 , the blf problem is analyzed further to account for the reduced volatility clustering and to construct the blf function . in sect .",
    "4 , we fit 100 + years of data of the daily historical volatility of the djia in order to determine parameters of the blf function .",
    "numerical estimates are given to illustrate the developed method .",
    "the minimization of the forecasting error for the reduced volatility predictor function is shown to be equivalent to the minimization of the forecasting error of the original volatility time series .",
    "an explicit expression for the forecasting error is given . in conclusion , a connection of the blf method with the arch models @xcite , in which future variance is also represented as a linear combination of the past observables , is discussed .",
    "the evolution of a market index value or a stock price @xmath4 is described by equation ( see e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath5 the value @xmath6 is a noise added to the path followed by @xmath7 with the expectation value @xmath8=0 $ ] and the variance of @xmath9=\\sigma ( t)^{2}dt.$ ] the volatility @xmath10 represents a generic measure of the magnitude of market fluctuations . we consider a discrete version of the random walk problem by setting @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 the sampling intervals are enumerated by integer time parameter @xmath14 .    the volatility @xmath10 is a hidden variable and its extraction form the market observables is a separate difficult task .",
    "the possible estimator @xmath15 of the volatility is defined in terms of returns @xmath16 in what follows , the term  volatility  refers to the estimator @xmath17 , the annualizing factor will not apply .",
    "a use of the variance estimator @xmath18 would complexify the problem due to divergences connected to the existence of power - law tails (  variance of variance  is infinite , @xmath19=\\infty , $ ] since @xmath20 at @xmath21 see e.g. @xcite ) . at large time scales ,",
    "different estimators are expected to be close to volatility @xmath10 and to each other .",
    "the problem of efficiency of volatility estimators is postponed for other studies .",
    "it is usually assumed that financial time series constitute stationary stochastic processes the autocorrelation functions of which depend on the relative time only .",
    "the stock evolution problem is assumed therefore to be invariant with respect to time translations .",
