    "the compton scattering is one of the most important scattering in physics particularly in the cosmology , astrophysics and astro - particle physics .",
    "although this scattering can be the main source to generate a linear polarized wave , it can not generate circular polarized wave .",
    "in fact , there is no many ways to generate circular polarization in a scattering process in the qed .",
    "therefore , any experiment including the measurement of circular polarization can provide a way to understand more accurately the physics of scattering .",
    "it is shown that in the presence of a background field such as noncommutativity ( nc ) in space - time or external magnetic field , the generation of circular polarization by the compton scattering is possible@xcite .",
    "meanwhile , it is recently shown that the photons of a linearly polarized laser beam can acquire circular or b - mode linear polarization by scattering off active neutrinos via a parity violation process .",
    "this phenomenon can possibly be used to understand the nature of neutrinos ( dirac or majorana ) , to detect the fluxes of cosmic neutrino background @xcite and to gain some insight into the physics of active and light sterile neutrino oscillations @xcite . here",
    "we would like to consider nc - space as a nontrivial background to explore the polarization of photons in the compton scattering . the nc field theory and its phenomenological aspects",
    "have been considered for many years without any sign in nature@xcite .",
    "the nc space - time which is predicted in the string theory should have a scale @xmath8 of the order of the planck scale .",
    "nevertheless , it is believed that @xmath8 like the other new physics scales may has some impact at the tev scale . however , the null results mean that the parameter of noncommutativity , if exist , is minuscule .",
    "in fact , to find the nc effects one should consider those processes in which such effects can be enhanced . to this end",
    "we consider those experiments which are based on the laser technologies . as in the compton scattering in the nc - space",
    "the photons with the linear polarization transform partly to circularly polarized photons with a rate proportional to the nc - parameter , number of photons per pulse and the flux of fermions , one expects the enhancement of the rate of generation of the circular polarization with the intensities .",
    "usually intense laser beams are designed for a wide - ranging experimental program in fundamental physics and advanced applications such as the interaction of super high intensity light with matter , fast ignition fusion research , photon induced nuclear reactions , electron and ion acceleration by light waves , astrophysics in the laboratory and the exploration of the exotic world of plasma dominated by relativity .",
    "some of the important laser beams are : x - ray free - electron laser ( xfel ) facilities @xcite , optical high - intensity laser facilities such as vulcan @xcite , peta - watt laser beam @xcite and eli @xcite , as well as slac e144 using nonlinear compton scattering @xcite .    in this work , we consider the forward compton scattering through the collision of photons in a laser beam with an intense and high energy muon / electron beam in the noncommutative space to examine the generation of circular polarization .",
    "consequently , we calculate the generation rate of the circularly polarized photons @xmath9 to explore the possibility of discovering the nc effects in different energy scales .",
    "it is clear to obtain a large value for @xmath9 to be measurable in lab , one needs intense muon / electron and laser beams .",
    "therefore , an accelerator that can produce ultra - intense beams of muons and even electrons provides opportunities to discover the nc effect .",
    "in sec.ii we review the stokes parameters and boltzmann equation formalism . in sec .",
    "iii the noncommutative standard model ( ncsm ) is briefly explained and the time evolution of the stokes parameters related to the compton scattering in ncsm is discussed . in sec .",
    "iv we study the effect of space - time noncommutativity on the collision of a laser beam with an ultra - intense beam of muon / electron . in sec.v",
    "we give an estimation on the generation rate of the circular polarization in such interactions . in sec.vi",
    "some concluding remarks are given .",
    "laser beam polarization can be characterized by four known stokes parameters which are @xmath10 the total intensity of the beam , @xmath11 and @xmath12 the linear polarization of the radiation and @xmath13 the difference between positive and negative circular polarization . moreover ,",
    "the density operator of an ensemble of photons in terms of the stokes parameters is defined as follows @xmath14 where @xmath15 @xmath16 is the general density - matrix which is related to the photon number operator @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are photon creation and annihilation operators . the expectation value of the number operator is defined as @xmath20=(2\\pi)^3 \\delta^3(0)(2k^0)\\rho_{ij}(\\textbf{k}).\\label{t1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the time evolution of the operator @xmath21 , considered in the heisenberg picture , is @xmath22,\\ ] ] here @xmath23 is the full hamiltonian . meanwhile , the time evolution equation for the density matrix up to the first order of the interacting hamiltonian @xmath24 for photons can be written as @xmath25\\rangle \\nonumber \\\\ & -&\\frac{1}{2}\\int dt\\langle \\left[h^0_i(t);\\left[h^0_i ( 0);d^0_{ij}(\\textbf{k})\\right]\\right]\\label{bo}\\rangle , \\hspace{1 cm } \\label{density}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the first term on the right - hand side is a forward scattering term , and the second one is a higher order collision term , usual scattering cross section .",
    "the leading - order interacting hamiltonian for photon - charged fermion is generally given by @xcite @xmath26\\left[b^\\dagger_{r'}a^{\\dagger}_{s'}(\\mathcal{m})a_sb_r\\right],\\label{h0 }     \\label{h}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the amplitude of scattering matrix , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are charged fermion creation and annihilation operators and @xmath30 and @xmath31 , with the same relations for @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "the operator expectation values are given as a function of number density of fermions per unit volume , @xmath34 , where @xmath35 denotes the momentum of fermions@xcite .",
    "then the energy density and pressure of fermions are defined as @xmath36 with @xmath37 shows the number of spin states or degrees of freedom .",
    "in this section we explore the time evolution of the stokes parameters via the forward photon - fermion scattering in the nc standard model .",
    "the noncommutative version of standard model is introduced by two different approaches . in the first approach which is based on the `` seiberg - witten '' maps , the symmetry group , number of gauge fields and particles are the same as the ordinary standard model @xcite . meanwhile , in the second approach the gauge group is @xmath38 which can be reduced to the standard model gauge group through appropriate symmetry breaking @xcite . here",
    "we follow the first approach to do our calculations .    in the both versions of the noncommutative standard model ,",
    "the ordinary coordinates convert to the noncommutative operators with a canonical form as @xmath39=i\\theta^{\\mu\\nu } \\varpropto i\\frac{1}{\\lambda_{\\tiny{nc}}^2},\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the parameter of noncommutativity and @xmath41 is the noncommutative scale of energy .",
    "also in the both version , moyal - star product realization of the algebra are considered .",
    "the noncommutative parameter , @xmath40 , can be usually divided into two parts : the time - space component @xmath42 and the space - space component @xmath43 where @xmath44 .",
    "the nc scale for the space - space and the time - space parts can be defined as @xcite : @xmath45    where @xmath46 and @xmath47 refer to fixed direction in space .",
    "although the time - space component of the nc parameter has some problems with the unitarity , the quantum mechanics can become unitary in some cases for the time - like part of nc - parameter too @xcite .    in the both approaches besides the corrections on the usual vertices new couplings also appear in comparison with the ordinary standard model .    using the ncsm based on the first approach @xcite , photon and charged fermion scattering",
    "can be described , up to the lowest order , by feynman diagrams given in fig([compton ] ) .",
    "now we are ready to examine the time evolution of the stokes parameters for photon - fermion scattering in ncqed .",

    "however , for a particle with mass @xmath71 and beam energy @xmath72 in circular motion with radius @xmath73 , the energy loss per revolution is given by @xmath74 which is smaller for a larger radius or for a more massive particle .",
    "therefore , accelerating the electron as the lightest charged particle to very high energy is a difficult task in the circular collider . in the lep experiment ,",
    "electrons were accelerated up to @xmath75@xcite . meanwhile , in a linear collider such as an international linear collider(ilc ) one can reach to higher energies about @xmath76 or even more .",
    "furthermore , in laser - plasma accelerators , electron can be accelerated to energies from hundreds of mev @xcite to multi - gev energies @xcite .",
    "muon as the 2nd lightest charged particle in nature but not stable , is almost 200 times more massive than the electron .",
    "in fact , the muon mean lifetime is very short about @xmath77 , but enough to provide an intense beam which can be accelerated to high energy .",
    "however , pion decay can be usually used as a source for the muon production via @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "meanwhile , colliding high energy protons with nuclei produce pions through interactions such as : @xmath80 and @xmath81 for the proton energies more than 400 mev and the double pion production in @xmath82 at the larger energies .",
    "according to the momentum of the generated muon beam they are called `` decay muon beam '' or `` surface muon beam '' .",
    "the first type of muon beam is about 80 percent polarized and have momentum from 40 to several hundreds of mev / c .",
    "such muon beams are available at psi , triumf , j - parc and riken - ral .",

    "besides , very low energy muon beams ( ultra slow muons with energy at ev - kev range ) can be generated by reducing the energy of an arizona beam@xcite which is available in the psi while the high - intensity low - energy muon beam is developing in j - parc .",
    "recently a multi - tev muon collider , so called `` muon accelerator program '' ( map ) , has been planed .",
    "the purpose of this program is to develop the concepts and technologies required for the muon collider and neutrino factories @xcite .",
    "for a typical muon beam with the number of muon per bunch @xmath83 , the energy range @xmath84 , the size of beam in the interaction region @xmath85 and the bunch length about @xmath85 , one can estimate an average energy of flux per bunch as @xmath86 this type of muon beam has an angle divergence about @xmath87 which is negligible in the high energy muon beam accelerator which is the case for example in the map experiment@xcite . to find the faraday conversion for instance in photon - muon beams interaction we have for the interacting spot a spatial interval @xmath88 where d is the distance between muon beam and interaction spot with laser beam and a temporal interval of the order of @xmath89 sec .",
    "therefore , for a laser beam with energy of photons about @xmath90 the eq.([vss ] ) for the conversion @xmath91 leads to @xmath92 where @xmath93 when the laser beam is perpendicular to the muon beam .",

    "if we assume each laser pulse in its path can interact @xmath96-times with the muon beams , the maximum value of @xmath96 can be estimate as @xmath97 @xcite",

    "[ tab : conversion1 ]    meanwhile , one can use eq.([muon1 ] ) with appropriate changes for the other charged fermions . for instance , for the electron one can consider the appropriate parameters from the lep experiment@xcite in which the number of electrons per bunch is about @xmath99 locating at energies @xmath100 , where the size of beam in interaction region and bunch length are both about @xmath85 . therefore",
    ", the mean energy of flux of the electron beam can be estimated as @xmath101 which cast eq.([muon1 ] ) into @xmath102 in this case the values of @xmath103 for different values of @xmath8 in interaction of linearly polarized laser beam and the electron beam can be obtained which is given in tab.([tab : conversion2 ] ) .",
    "[ tab : conversion2 ]",
    "in the previous section the faraday conversion has been found to be at most @xmath104 in the case of muons .",
    "although this value seems to be small we show that can be large enough for the rate of generating circular polarization for the laser beam interacting with the muon / electron beam . to this end",
    ", we use eq.([vss ] ) in which @xmath105 represents the number of generated circularly polarized photons with energy @xmath106 per unit area @xmath107 per unit time @xmath108 for each laser pulse .",
    "the rate of the circular polarization generation for photons in the laser beam can be estimated as follows @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the laser - beam size which is smaller than the charged lepton beam size @xmath111 and represents the effective area of photon - charged lepton interaction , @xmath112 is the time duration of a laser pulse and @xmath113 the laser repetition rate is the number of laser pulses per second . to have more efficiency , we assume that the laser and charged lepton beams are synchronized and the @xmath113 is equal to @xmath114 the repetition rate of beam which is the number of charged lepton bunches per second .",
    "therefore , one can easily find the value of @xmath9 as follows @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the number of photons per pulse which can be obtained as @xmath117 and the total energy of a laser pulse @xmath118 .",
