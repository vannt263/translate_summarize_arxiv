    "the result is summarized in table  [ table : sw - perm ] .",
    "as stated in previous section , triangular elimination preserves facet supporting property ( theorem  [ thrm : kn - k1 mm ]  ( [ enum : kn - k1mm - facet ] ) ) and inequivalence property under known isomorphisms ( corollary  [ corl : sw - perm - n - even ] ) , which correspond to party , observable and value exchanges . as a consequence ,",

    "in addition , we denote @xmath451 and @xmath452 as @xmath453 and @xmath454 respectively , and define @xmath455 similarly .",
    "then , terms of the left hand side of inequality are arrayed in the format introduced by collins and gisin  @xcite ; each row corresponds to coefficients of each observable of party @xmath126 and each column corresponds to that of party @xmath456 .",
    "because of switching equivalence , we can assume that the right hand side of inequality are always zero .",
    "the example of the chsh @xmath457 is arrayed in the form as follows : @xmath458    note that the complete graph @xmath459 for some @xmath305 has symmetric group @xmath460 as its automorphism group , on the other hand , the complete tripartite graph @xmath461 has only the subgroup of @xmath460 .",
    "therefore , some classes of facets which are originally equivalent as a facet class of @xmath462 under permutation and switching can define inequivalent families of bell inequalities .      in the case of cut polytope of complete graph ,",
    "some explicit classes of valid inequalities are known , for example , the hypermetric , clique - web and gap inequalities  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* part v ) . for these classes of inequalities ,",
    "some sufficient conditions to be facet supporting are also known .",
    "therefore through triangular elimination , we can obtain families of tight bell inequalities from them .",
    "first , we give a new family of tight bell inequalities found by applying triangular elimination to the hypermetric inequality class  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter  28 ) .",
    "a special case of this family , namely the triangular eliminated pure hypermetric inequality , contains four previously known bell inequalities : the trivial inequalities like @xmath463 , the well known chsh inequality found by clauser , horne , shimony and holt  @xcite , the inequality named @xmath12 by collins and gisin  @xcite , originally found by pitowsky and svozil  @xcite , and the @xmath464 inequality by collins and gisin  @xcite .",

    "for example , by letting @xmath486 and @xmath490 , @xmath491 has the following facet : @xmath492      there are more general classes of facets in cut polytope of the complete graph .",
    "of these classes , the clique - web inequalities contains hypermetric inequalities as a special case .",

    "these separated families are induced by the original classes and the embedding into the @xmath56 .",
    "collins and gisin  @xcite proposed a family of tight bell inequalities obtained by the extension of chsh and @xmath12 as @xmath496 family , and conjectured that @xmath496 is always facet supporting ( they also confirmed that for @xmath497 , @xmath496 is actually facet supporting by computation ) . therefore , whether their @xmath496 can be obtained by triangular elimination of some facet class of @xmath495 is an interesting question .",
    "the @xmath496 family has the structure as follows :    @xmath498    from its structure , it is straightforward that if @xmath496 can be obtained by triangular elimination of some facet class of @xmath495 , then only @xmath499 and @xmath500 are detour vertices , since other vertices have degree more than @xmath501 .",
    "however , there is no known corresponding facet class of cut polytope in this form . for specific values , by computation , we found that corresponding facets for @xmath502 are the triangle , pentagonal and grishukhin  @xcite inequality @xmath503 , respectively .",
    "since we have obtained a large number of tight bell inequalities by triangular elimination of @xmath495 , the next question is whether they are complete i.e. , whether all families and its equivalents form whole set of facets of @xmath13 .    for @xmath504 case ,",
    "this is affirmative .",
    "both liwa  @xcite and collins and gisin  @xcite showed that there are only three kinds of inequivalent facets : the trivial , chsh and @xmath12 , corresponding to the triangle facet , the triangular elimination of the triangle facet and the triangular elimination of the pentagonal facet of @xmath495 , respectively .    on the other hand , for @xmath505 ,",
    "the answer is negative because there is facet , found by facet enumeration of @xmath506 by lrs  @xcite , such as @xmath507 the counterpart of this inequality in cut polytope is neither a facet of @xmath495 nor the triangular elimination of any facet of @xmath495 because it has no vertex with degree @xmath501 .",
    "actually , in the asymmetric setting with 2 parties having 3 and 4 2-valued observables , collins and gisin enumerated all of the tight bell inequalities and classified them into 6 families of equivalent inequalities  @xcite . while the trivial , chsh , @xmath12 and @xmath464 inequalities are either facets of @xmath77 or their triangular eliminations , the other two are not : @xmath508 we also consider the inequalities   and later in section  [ sec : asymm ] .",
