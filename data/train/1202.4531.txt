    "recent experimental and theoretical studies have shown that external electromagnetic fields can be used as a powerful tool to manipulate molecular collisions and chemical reactivity at low temperatures @xcite .",

    "these pioneering studies demonstrate that future progress in the field of cold molecules  in particular , the ability to create large , dense , and stable ensembles of chemically diverse molecular species  will depend to a large extent on our understanding of their collisional properties @xcite .",
    "theoretical modeling of molecular collision experiments performed at temperatures below 1  k requires quantum scattering calculations based on multidimensional potential energy surfaces ( pess ) of unprecedented accuracy , which generally remain beyond the capabilities of modern _ ab initio _ methods .",
    "a way out of this difficulty is to adjust the interaction pess based on experimental measurements of collision observables such as trap loss rates @xcite .",
    "the crucial link between intermolecular pess and laboratory observations is provided by quantum scattering calculations , which yield collisional properties of molecules exactly for a given pes . because of the need to incorporate symmetry breaking effects arising from the presence of external fields @xcite , such calculations are more challenging than their field - free counterparts . in particular , the total angular momentum of the collision pair is no longer conserved in the presence of external fields , invalidating the standard approaches of molecular collision theory based on the total angular momentum representation @xcite .",
    "a theoretical formalism for quantum scattering calculations of molecular collisions in external fields was developed by volpi and bohn and by krems and dalgarno @xcite .",
    "the formalism is based on the fully uncoupled space - fixed representation , in which the wavefunction of the collision complex is expanded in direct products of rotational basis functions and spherical harmonics describing the orbital motion of the collision partners in a space - fixed ( sf ) coordinate frame @xcite .",
    "several groups have used this representation to study the effects of external electric , magnetic , and microwave fields on atom - molecule @xcite and molecule - molecule @xcite collisions .",
    "these studies have shown that the fully uncoupled sf formalism meets with serious difficulties when applied to collision problems characterized by strongly anisotropic interactions @xcite .",
    "more specifically , the interaction anisotropy strongly couples different rotational and partial wave basis states , leading to very large systems of coupled - channel equations that are beyond the capability of present - day computational resources .",
    "as most atom - molecule and molecule - molecule interactions are strongly anisotropic , this difficulty has precluded converged calculations on many interesting collision systems , including li + hf @xmath0 lif + h @xcite , rb + nd@xmath1 @xcite , li + nh @xcite , and nh + nh @xcite .    we have recently developed an alternative approach to atom - molecule and molecule - molecule scattering in a magnetic field based on the total angular momentum representation @xcite .",
    "the total angular momentum of the collision complex is approximately conserved even in the presence of external fields ; thus , using basis functions with well - defined total angular momentum allows for a substantial reduction in the number of scattering channels @xcite .",
    "this advantage allowed us to obtain numerally converged scattering cross sections for strongly anisotropic atom - molecule @xcite and molecule - molecule @xcite collisions in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "magnetic fields interact with the electron spin of the molecule , which can be weakly coupled to the intermolecular axis and often plays a spectator role during the collision . as a result , while an applied magnetic field shifts the energies of the colliding molecules and may lead to the appearance of scattering resonances , it hardly affects the mechanism of collision - induced energy transfer .",
    "in contrast , electric fields break the inversion symmetry of the collision problem and alter the selection rules for parity - changing transitions , leading to more dramatic changes in collision mechanisms .",

    "<S> it is shown that the atom - molecule collision problem in the presence of an external electric field can be solved using the total angular momentum representation in the body - fixed coordinated frame , leading to a computationally efficient method for _ ab initio _ modeling of low - temperature scattering phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations demonstrate rapid convergence of the cross sections for vibrational and stark relaxation in he - cad collisions with the number of total angular momentum states in the basis set , leading to a 5 - 100 fold increase in computational efficiency over the previously used methods based on the fully uncoupled space - fixed representation . </S>",
    "<S> these results open up the possibility of carrying out numerically converged quantum scattering calculations on a wide array of atom - molecule collisions and chemical reactions in the presence of electric fields . </S>"
