    "neutrinos play a special role in the @xmath0 electroweak theory . while the left - handed neutrinos are part of @xmath1 doublets @xmath2 the right - handed neutrinos are @xmath1 singlets .",
    "since the electromagnetic charge and the @xmath3 hypercharge differ by the value of the third component of weak isospin @xmath4 one sees that the right - handed neutrinos @xmath5 carry * no * @xmath6 quantum numbers .",
    "the above has two important experimental implications :    \\i ) the neutrinos seen experimentally are those produced by the weak interactions .",
    "these neutrinos are purely left - handed .",
    "\\ii ) because one can not infer the existence of right - handed neutrinos from weak processes , the presence of @xmath5 can only be seen indirectly , most likely through the existence of neutrino masses .",
    "however , it should be noted that neutrino masses do not necessarily imply the existence of right - handed neutrinos .    before discussing issues connected with neutrino masses",
    ", it is useful to summarize what we know about the left - handed neutrinos from their weak interactions . in the electroweak theory these neutrinos couple to the @xmath7-boson in a universal fashion @xmath8_\\nu~,\\ ] ] where @xmath9_\\nu = \\sum_i ( \\bar\\nu_{\\ell_i})_{\\rm l } \\gamma_\\mu ( \\nu_{\\ell_i})_{\\rm l}~.\\ ] ] precision studies of the @xmath7-line shape allow the determination of the number of neutrino species @xmath10 , since as this number increases so does the @xmath7 total width .",
    "each neutrino type ( provided its mass @xmath11 ) contributes the same amount to the @xmath7-width@xcite @xmath12 here @xmath13 is the fermi constant as determined in @xmath14-decay@xcite and @xmath15 is related to the axial coupling of the charged leptons to the @xmath7-boson : @xmath16 .",
    "using@xcite @xmath17 which is the average of the results obtained by the four lep collaborations and sld , one has numerically @xmath18 using the above , the number of different neutrino species , @xmath19 , can then be derived from the precision measurements of the @xmath7 total width and of its partial width into hadrons and leptons using the ( obvious ) equation @xmath20    from a fit of the @xmath7-line shape for @xmath21 and @xmath22 hadrons at lep one can extract very accurate values for @xmath23 and @xmath24 : @xmath25 whence it follows that the , so - called , invisible width is @xmath26 and thus one deduces for @xmath19the number of neutrino species : @xmath27 this result strongly supports the notion , expressed in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , that there are only 3 generations of leptons .",
    "it turns out that one can get a more accurate value for @xmath19 by using other information derivable from the @xmath7-line shape .",
    "the cross - section for @xmath22 hadrons can be expressed in terms of three factors:@xcite a peak cross - section @xmath28 a breit - wigner factor @xmath29 and a computable initial state bremsstrahlung correction @xmath30 , with @xmath31 the value of @xmath32 extracted from an analysis of the cross - section for @xmath22 hadrons at lep@xcite @xmath33 can be combined with the lep results for the ratio of hadronic to leptonic partial widths of the @xmath7 @xmath34 to deduce , with a little bit of theoretical input , a value for @xmath19 .",
    "this value , as we will see , is slightly more accurate than that given in eq . ( 11 ) .    using eqs .",

    "( 3 ) describing the coupling of the @xmath41 boson to the leptonic charged currents . again only left - handed neutrinos are involved .",
    "one has @xmath42 where @xmath43 the states that appear in eq .",
    "( 21 ) in general are not mass eigenstates , since mass generation can mix leptons of the same charge among each other .",
    "nevertheless , one can always diagonalize the charged lepton mass matrix by a by - unitary transformation of the left- and right - handed charged lepton fields : @xmath44 after this transformation , the charged currents in eq . ( 21 ) read @xmath45 where @xmath46    note that because @xmath47 is unitary , the neutral current @xmath48_\\nu$ ] is the same whether it is expressed in terms of @xmath49 or @xmath50 .",
    "conventionally , the states @xmath51 are called * weak interaction eigenstates * , since they are produced in the decay of a @xmath52 boson in association with a physically charged lepton @xmath53 of definite mass .",
    "these states , of course , are also pair produced by the @xmath7-boson .",
    "for ease of notation , in what follows i will drop the tilde on both @xmath54 and @xmath55 with the understanding that the states now called @xmath56 are those produced by the weak interactions ",
    "they are the weak interaction eigenstates .",
    "similarly , the charged leptons @xmath57 are the states associated with a diagonal mass matrix @xmath58",
    "with these preliminaries underway , i want now to examine in a bit of detail the possible patterns of neutrino masses .",
    "to do so , it is useful to first review how fermion masses originate in field theory",
    ". the mass term with which everybody is acquainted with is one involving a fermion @xmath59 and its conjugate @xmath60 : @xmath61 with @xmath62 , @xmath63 being the usual projections @xmath64 this term , obviously , conserves fermion number @xmath65 and gives equal mass for particles and antiparticles @xmath66 for particles carrying any @xmath3 quantum number , like electromagnetic charge , it is clear that @xmath67 is the * only * possible mass term , since to preserve these @xmath3 quantum numbers one needs always to have particle - antiparticle interactions .",
    "neutrinos , however , provide an interesting exception . because neutrinos do not have electromagnetic charge , it is possible to contemplate other types of mass terms for them besides the particle - antiparticle term given in eq .",
    "these other neutrino mass terms , contain two neutrino ( or two antineutrino ) fields .",
    "hence they violate fermion number ( and in some cases @xmath0 ) , but otherwise are allowed by lorentz invariance .",
    "as we discuss in more detail in appendix a , one can write three different types of mass terms for neutrinos : @xmath68 - \\frac{1}{2 } [ \\overline{\\nu_{\\rm r}}\\tilde c m_s\\overline{\\nu_{\\rm r}}^t + \\nu^t_{\\rm r } \\tilde cm^\\dagger_s\\nu_{\\rm r } ] \\nonumber \\\\ & - & \\frac{1}{2}[\\nu_{\\rm l}^t\\tilde cm_t\\nu_{\\rm l } + \\overline{\\nu_{\\rm l}}\\tilde c m_t^\\dagger\\overline{\\nu_{\\rm l}}^t]~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the mass matrices @xmath69 are lorentz scalars .",
    "however , their presence is only possible as a result of different symmetry breakdowns .",
    "specifically , @xmath70 conserves fermion number , but violate @xmath0 since it does not transform as an @xmath1 doublet .",
    "this fermion number conserving mass is often called a dirac mass . thus , in a happy confluence of notation , @xmath70 can stand both for a dirac mass and a doublet mass .",
    "both @xmath71 and @xmath72 violate fermion number by two units and are known as majorana masses . because @xmath71 couples @xmath73 with itself ,",
    "clearly it is an @xmath0 invariant .",
    "this is not the case for @xmath72 , which violates @xmath0 because it does not transform as an @xmath1 triplet .",
    "the matrix @xmath74 which enters in the majorana mass terms in eq .",
    "( 30 ) is there to preserve lorentz invariance .",
    "appendix a contains a detailed discussion of this point , along with a pedagogical review of how one constructs 4-spinors starting from 2-dimensional weyl spinors .",
    "i note here only that @xmath74 is * not * to be confused with the matrix @xmath75 connected with how dirac fields transform under charge conjugation.@xcite and @xmath74 is often blurred in the literature .",

    ", then @xmath81 .",

    "eq . ( 30 ) displays the most general neutrino mass term , involving three distinct mass matrices @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 . if there are only three flavors of neutrinos these are @xmath88 matrices . for the moment",
    "this is what we shall assume , but we shall return to this point later on",

    "this diagonalization is accomplished by a basis change on the original neutrino fields @xmath101 to a new set of fields @xmath102 and @xmath103 defined by the equations : @xmath104    it is useful to consider the simple , but physically interesting case,@xcite of just one family of neutrinos .",
    "further , let us imagine @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "the @xmath107 matrix @xmath97 in this case reads simply @xmath108 this matrix has two eigenvalues , given approximately by @xmath71 and @xmath109 .",

    "this , so called , * see - saw mechanism * is very suggestive .",
    "it is natural to expect that @xmath70 should be of the order of the charged lepton mass , corresponding to the neutrino in question : @xmath111 .",
    "then the spectrum of leptons has a natural hierarchy : @xmath112 so , if there is a large mass scale associated with the right - handed neutrinos ( the mass scale @xmath71 , which is * not * constrained by the scale of @xmath0 breaking , since it is an @xmath0 singlet ) one readily understands why neutrino masses could be so much lighter than the corresponding charged lepton masses .",
    "the matrix @xmath97 in the simple @xmath107 example above is diagonalized ( approximately ) by the orthogonal matrix @xmath113 the two neutrino mass eigenstates are then @xmath114 i note that the mass eigenstates @xmath115 and @xmath116 are majorana ( self - conjugate ) states @xmath117 the @xmath118 state which enters in the weak interactions , for all practical purposes is , essentially @xmath119 .",
    "that is , it is the state associated with the light neutrino eigenstate @xmath120 : @xmath121 the right - handed neutrino @xmath73 , on the other hand , is essentially the heavy neutrinos eigenstate @xmath122 : @xmath123    this simple example can be easily generalized to the @xmath88 case of interest . again , if the matrix @xmath72 is negligible ( i.e. if its eigenvalues are negligibly small ) , then the neutrino mass matrix @xmath97 takes the approximate form @xmath124 provided the eigenvalues of @xmath71 are large compared to those of @xmath70 , then again the spectrum separates into a light and heavy neutrino sector .",
    "the light neutrinos have a @xmath88 mass matrix @xmath125 while the heavy neutrino mass eigenstates are the eigenstates of the @xmath88 matrix @xmath126    the see - saw mechanism , in my view , is the only natural way to understand ev neutrino masses .",
    "let me expand a bit on this point .",
    "simce @xmath71 is an @xmath0 invariant parameter , there are no constraints on it . on the other hand ,",
    "as we discussed earlier , both @xmath70 and @xmath72 can only originate * after * @xmath0 breaking .",
    "the yukawa interaction , of @xmath73 with a left - handed doublet @xmath127 via a higgs doublet @xmath128 @xmath129 leads to a dirac mass @xmath130 since @xmath131 is fixed by the scale of the @xmath0 breakdown : @xmath132 to get @xmath70 to have a value in the ev range requires that @xmath133 !",
    "the situation is not much less artificial in the case of @xmath72 . in this case , to get a non - zero value for @xmath72 it is necessary to introduce a higgs triplet field @xmath134 .",
    "this field can couple to @xmath135 so that if , indeed , @xmath134 gets a vev one can generate a triplet mass @xmath72 . in detail , the triplet coupling involving @xmath134 has the form @xmath136 where @xmath137 is an unknown coupling constant .",
    "when the neutral component of @xmath134 , @xmath138 , gets a vacuum expectation , then @xmath139 generates a mass term for @xmath118 : @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",

    "so , also in this case , if @xmath142 is near this limit to get neutrino masses in the ev range one needs a yukawa strength of order @xmath146 .",
    "if @xmath147 then @xmath137 can be larger , but one is left to explain the reason for the doublet - triplet vev hierarchy .",
    "elementary higgs triplets do not emerge very naturally in models .",
    "however , one can always get an * effective * triplet out of two higgs doublets : @xmath148 where @xmath75 is an appropriate charge conjugation matrix .",
    "effective l - violating interactions involving pairs of doublet higgs fields arise quite naturally in grand unified theories@xcite as dimension 5 terms : @xmath149 in the above , @xmath150 is a scale associated with the gut breakdown scale and @xmath151 is a coupling constant .",
    "clearly the above interaction gives @xmath152 since @xmath153 gev , with @xmath154 , one gets @xmath155 ev for scales @xmath156 gev , which are typical of guts .",

    "it is clearly more appealing physically to have light neutrinos be the result of new physics at high scales , rather than simply as a result of some yukawa coupling being unnaturally small .",
    "if neutrinos have mass then , in general , the neutrinos produced by the weak interactions ( weak interaction eigenstates ) are not states of definite mass ( mass eigenstates ) . in the basis where the charged lepton mass matrix is diagonal [ c.f .",

    "the most relevant is the constraint which follows from demanding that the energy density in neutrinos should not overclose the universe .",
    "neutrinos are thermal relics ; they decoupled from the universe s expansion when their interaction rate @xmath272 fell below the universe s expansion rate @xmath273 .",

    ", decoupling occurs at a temperature @xmath279 determined by setting @xmath280 .",
    "this gives @xmath281    two cases are of interest .",
    "if neutrinos have a mass much less than @xmath279 ( @xmath282 ) they are * hot relics*. that is , they are relativistic at the time of decoupling .",
    "for hot relics , the density of neutrinos is comparable to that of photons at decoupling : @xmath283 .",
    "* cold relics * , on the other hand , are neutrinos whose mass is much greater than @xmath279 ( @xmath284 ) . in this case , at the time of decoupling the neutrino density @xmath285 , because of the boltzmann factor , is much below that of the photons .",
    "thus for cold relics , @xmath286 .    in either case , one can compute the neutrino contribution to the energy density of the universe .",
    "@xcite this is simplest for the case of hot relics , since their number density essentially tracks the photon number density . is not quite the same as the photon temperature @xmath287 .",
    "one finds @xmath288.@xcite ] thus the number density of neutrinos now is fixed by the measured temperature of the microwave background radiation : @xmath289 hence the contribution of neutrinos to the present energy density of the universe is @xmath290    it has become conventional to normalize all densities in terms of the universe s closure density @xmath291 : @xmath292 in the above @xmath235 is the hubble constant and @xmath293 is a measure of its uncertainty .",
    "one finds @xmath294 with@xcite @xmath295 defining @xmath296 then , for hot relics , one has @xmath297 it follows from the above that if the sum of neutrino masses @xmath298 , then neutrinos would close the universe . because we know that the universe is not very far from closure density , if neutrinos are hot relics the sum of their masses can not be much above 30 ev .",
    "thus , although direct bounds allows for a presence of a ",
    "@xmath168 \" neutrino with mass  @xmath299 \" less than 170 kev , cosmology forbids neutrinos to have masses as large as that .    when neutrino masses are above @xmath300 , then the simple formula given in eq .",
    "( 126 ) no longer applies .",
    "nevertheless , it is still possible to compute @xmath301 taking into account now of the appropriate boltzmann factor .",
    "figure 2 , adapted from @xcite , plots @xmath302 as a function of the neutrino ( sum ) mass .",
    "this quantity rises linearly with mass up to @xmath303 and then drops rather rapidly .",
    "cosmology allows neutrino masses for which @xmath304 .",
    "so , as mentioned above ,  @xmath299 \" and  @xmath305 \" must really be well below their kinematical bounds . on the other hand , we note that our bounds for  @xmath269 \" and @xmath306 lie in a cosmologically allowed region . in principle",
    ", cosmology also allows neutrinos to exist with masses greater than a few gev , since these cold relics give @xmath304 .",
    "however , as we discussed earlier , neutrino counting at lep excludes additional neutrinos besides @xmath307 and @xmath209 , with mass @xmath308 .",
    "this exclusion region is also indicated in fig .",
    "2 .      two experiments at cern , using @xmath168 beams of average neutrino energies @xmath309 and typical decay lengths @xmath310 , put strong limits on @xmath311 neutrino oscillations for @xmath312 . in view of the discussion in the last subsection , this is a very interesting mass range to explore , since neutrinos with masses in this range could be of cosmological interest .",
    "these two experiments use quite different techniques to detect @xmath209 s .",
    "chorus@xcite uses an emulsion target to try to detect the @xmath313 track produced in @xmath209 charged current interactions .",
    "nomad , @xcite on the other hand , uses drift chambers and kinematical techniques to detect a @xmath209 signal .",
    "the result of both experiments are shown in fig .",
    "3 , along with limits obtained by some earlier experiments .",
    "the chorus and nomad results for @xmath314 exclude oscillations with mixing angles @xmath315 at the 90% c.l . , improving previous limits by about a factor of 5 .    because nomad has a very good electron identification ,",
    "this experiment is also able to set a strong limit for @xmath316 oscillations . for @xmath314 ,",
    "one excludes oscillations with mixing angles @xmath317 at 90% c.l . finally , because the @xmath168 beam at cern has about a 1% @xmath167 admixture , both experiments are also able to exclude @xmath318 oscillations for @xmath312 , but now only for mixing angles @xmath319 , at 90% c.l .",
    "the situation regarding neutrino oscillations is much less clear cut in the region @xmath320 .",
    "here there are limits from past accelerator and reactor searches for oscillations and recent bounds from the karmen experiment .",
    "@xcite . however , there is also some evidence for @xmath316 oscillations coming from the lsnd experiment.@xcite let me begin by briefly detailing the results of this last experiment first .",
    "lsnd studies neutrinos originating from pions produced at rest at the lampf beam stop by an 800 mev proton beam .",
    "these neutrinos , which are produced in the chain @xmath321 , have average momenta in the 30 to 50 mev range .",
    "what lsnd looks for is the oscillation of the @xmath322 produced in @xmath323 decay into a @xmath324 , using a delayed coincidence in a target 30 meters from the beam dump .",
    "if @xmath325 oscillations take place , the @xmath324 inverse @xmath260-decay in the target ( @xmath326 ) produces a prompt photon from @xmath327 annihilation , while the produced neutron gives a delayed photon , as a result of the process @xmath328 .",
    "the lsnd experiment observes an excess of @xmath329 coincidence events which , if interpreted as @xmath325 oscillations , give a substantial * allowed region * in the @xmath251 plane .",
    "however , as i mentioned above , other experiments performed in the past,@xcite as well as the recent karmen experiment,@xcite exclude almost all of this allowed region .",
    "furthermore , new data from the karmen2 detector@xcite which became available in summer 1998 appeared to exclude even the small remaining allowed region for lsnd !    this rather confusing situation is displayed in fig .",
    "it was discussed in some detail in the summary talk of janet conrad at the 1998 vancouver international conference on high energy physics.@xcite as one can see from fig .",
    "4 , a combination of the bnl 776 data and the bugey reactor data only leaves the region between @xmath330 as an  allowed \" region for the lsnd signal . however , this region is essentially excluded by the karmen2 data , if one uses the 90% c.l .",
    "bound from this experiment .",
    "however , this result itself is somewhat anomalous , since the 90% c.l .",
    "sensitivity for karmen2 is actually below the lsnd signal .",
    "furthermore , the lsnd experiment has also looked for @xmath316 oscillations by studying @xmath167 quasielastic scattering events and the collaboration , again , find an excess of events .",
    "citelsnd2 if interpreted as resulting from oscillations , this additional signal gives a @xmath251 allowed region which is consistent with that obtained by the @xmath325 analysis .",
    "it is difficult to make strong statements at this stage .",
    "the best that one can say is that there are hints of @xmath316 oscillations in the region @xmath330 , with rather small mixing angles @xmath331 .",
    "large underground detectors , originally conceived to search for proton decay , are sensitive to the flux of neutrinos produced in the atmosphere .",
    "these neutrinos are mostly produced through the decay of pions , with the @xmath332 chain producing two @xmath168 neutrinos and antineutrinos for each @xmath167 neutrino and antineutrino .",
    "one has known since the early 1990 s that the observed flux of @xmath168 s appeared to be much smaller than expected , with the ratio@xcite @xmath333    although the anomalous ratio @xmath334 could be the result of neutrino oscillations , strong evidence for neutrino oscillations only emerged in summer 1998 from the superkamiokande experiment .",
    "the superkamiokande collaboration@xcite reported a pronounced zenith angle dependence for the flux of multi - gev @xmath168 neutrinos , but no such dependence from @xmath167 neutrinos . for neutrino energies in the multi - gev range ,",
    "the neutrino fluxes are not affected by geomagnetic effects in an asymmetric fashion .",
    "thus one expects the observed neutrino signal to be * up - down symmetric*. as can be seen in fig . 5 ,",
    "the superkamiokande data for multi - gev @xmath168 s is clearly up - down asymmetric .",
    "there are 139 up - going @xmath168 compared to 256 down going events .",
    "the observed asymmetry @xmath335 is a @xmath336 effect .",
    "the corresponding asymmetry for multi - gev @xmath167 @xmath337 is quite consistent with zero .",
    "the superkamiokande collaboration@xcite interprets these results as evidence for @xmath338 oscillations , with @xmath339 some other neutrino species .",
    "this is most dramatically demonstrated in fig .",
    "6 where the ratio of data to monte carlo is plotted as a function of @xmath340 for both @xmath167 and @xmath168 events .",
    "no @xmath340 dependence is seen in the @xmath167 data , but the @xmath168 data drops down to a value of 1/2 for @xmath341 . recalling the simple 2-neutrino formula for the probability of oscillations [ eq .",
    "( 78 ) ] , fig . 6",
    "suggest immediately that @xmath342 and that the mixing angle @xmath231 is near maximal .",
    "this is confirmed by a more detailed analysis , which for @xmath338 oscillations gives @xmath343 and @xmath344 as the best fit point .",
    "it is unlikely , however , that the superkamiokande results are due to @xmath316 oscillations ( that is , that @xmath345 ) .",
    "first , the region in the @xmath251 plane favored by the superkamiokande results , is almost totally excluded already by the null results of the ch00z reactor experiment@xcite which looks at @xmath167 oscillations into another neutrino species .",
    "furthermore , the up - down ratio ( 129 ) for the @xmath167 flux is more than @xmath346 away from what one would expect if one were dealing with @xmath316 oscillations , where one expects @xmath347 if there are only three neutrino species , then most likely what is being seen in superkamiokande are @xmath311 oscillations .",
    "however , at this stage , it is not possible to rule out the possibility that @xmath339 may be a sterile neutrino @xmath348 .",
    "because they do not couple to the @xmath7 , they are not excluded by the neutrino counting results from lep . ]",
    "the superkamiokande results@xcite are consistent with previous kamiokande results,@xcite which also had indicated a ( less pronounced ) zenith angle dependence of the @xmath168 flux .",
    "although the @xmath251 regions for superkamiokande and kamiokande do not appear to overlap much , the 90% c.l .",
    "region of superkamiokande is  more - significant \" , since the kamiokande best fit has @xmath349 .",
    "in fact , recent results presented by superkamiokande at dpf 99,@xcite with more data collected , help span the gap , indicating even more clearly the consistency of all data with each other .    in addition , data from other underground experiments ( soudan@xcite and macro@xcite ) as well as other phenomena  like the flux of upward going muons @xcite produced by @xmath168 interactions in the earth  when interpreted in a neutrino oscillation framework , are totally consistent with the superkamiokande @xmath168 zenith angle results . fig .",
    "7 summarizes all this information in one graph .",
    "this figure provides quite strong evidence in favor of neutrino masses and is probably the strongest evidence we have to date for physics beyond the standard model .",
    "the study of the solar neutrino flux was started in the early 1970 s by ray davis and his group.@xcite at present there are five different experiments which give information on solar neutrinos ( homestake,@xcite gallex,@xcite sage,@xcite kamiokande@xcite and superkamiokande@xcite ) and all five have some bearing on the issue of neutrino oscillations .",
    "in fact , roughly speaking , all five experiments see approximately half of the expected rate , as shown in fig .",
    "8 . however , these experiments are sensitive to different parts of the solar neutrino spectrum , because the reactions they use to detect solar neutrinos in their detectors have different thresholds . sage and gallex study the reaction @xmath350 , which has a threshold of 0.23 mev .",
    "homestake looks for the excitation of chlorine ( @xmath351 ) which has a 0.8 mev threshold .",
    "the water cerenkov detectors , kamiokande and superkamiokande , study elastic @xmath352 scattering and their threshold is in the neighborhood of 6.5 mev .",
    "it has long been felt that the observed discrepancy between the neutrino signals detected and the expectations of the , so called , standard solar model(ssm ) @xcite is not due to defects in this model but to the presence of some new physical phenomena .",
    "one of the principal arguments in favor of this latter solution to the solar neutrino puzzle , has to do with the details of the signal expected in each experiment . because of the quite different threshold involved , each of the solar neutrino experiments , in fact , feels different pieces of the neutrino producing reactions in the solar cycle .",
    "for example , the gallium experiments are the only ones which are sensitive to neutrinos originating in the @xmath353 cycle ( the main solar cycle ) , with these neutrinos contributing about 50% of the expected rate .",
    "the homestate detector mostly measures neutrinos from @xmath354 , although it is also sensitive to @xmath355 neutrinos .",
    "finally , because of their high threshold , the big water cerenkov detectors only see boron neutrinos .",
    "these circumstances make it difficult to argue for an astrophysical solution to the solar neutrino deficit .",
    "much more natural is to imagine that this deficit arises as a result of neutrino oscillations .",
    "there are two distinct neutrino oscillation solutions to the solar neutrino problem . because roughly all experiments are reduced by about a factor of two from expectations ,",
    "it is possible to fit the data by using vacuum neutrino oscillations @xmath356 . clearly , for this fit one must appeal to large mixing angles and assume a tiny @xmath257 .",
    "since @xmath357 and the earth - sun distance @xmath358 , typically @xmath359 .",
    "however , because the homestake result is only about 30% of the predicted value , one has to fine - tune the parameters , so that only a few  just so \" regions are favored .",
    "@xcite a recent  just so \" fit by bahcall , krastev , and smirnov@xcite is shown in fig .",
    "9 .    in my opinion",
    ", much more interesting that the above  solution \" is the possibility that the solar neutrino results are a reflection of matter induced oscillations ( the msw effect we discuss in section v ) . in the sun , the electron density to a good approximation , can be characterized by an exponential profile function @xcite @xmath360 the central density @xmath361 is rather high and for appropriate values of @xmath257 and @xmath187 can exceed the critical msw density .",
    "for instance , for @xmath231 small , @xmath362 and @xmath363 @xmath364 it follows from eq .",

    "the actual calculation of what happens in the sun is rather complicated , @xcite since the density @xmath211 changes along the neutrino trajectory . since @xmath368 , the matter hamiltonian of eq .",

    "in fact , transitions can occur between these states .",

    "137 ) is satisfied at @xmath228 provided that@xcite @xmath377    for the adiabatic case , one can use our discussion of matter oscillations to give a qualitative picture of how the msw mechanism could work in the sun .",
    "because at the solar core @xmath365 , according to eq .",

    "because we are assuming adiabaticity , as the neutrinos diffuse out of the core of the sun , the state @xmath379 will evolve into @xmath373 .",
    "that is , there are no transitions in the sun .",
    "thus , when the neutrinos exit the sun , the state @xmath380 will just simply become @xmath381 . because @xmath382 it follows that , in this case , @xmath383    a more careful analysis shows that there are actually two msw solutions , one adiabatic and one non - adiabatic,@xcite both having @xmath384 .",
    "the adiabatic solution has large mixing angles @xmath385 .",
    "hence , according to eq .",
    "( 140 ) , @xmath386 so , indeed , roughly half the flux is lost .",
    "the non - adiabatic solution has @xmath387 .",
    "furthermore , a rather large range in the @xmath251 plane is eliminated by the absence of a day / night effect , which would be a sign of matter oscillations in the earth .",
    "the favored msw regions are depicted in fig . 10 .",
    "i want to close this brief discussion of solar neutrinos , and in particular of the msw explanation of the solar data , by making a more quantitative remark . to fit the solar neutrino data using the msw effect requires that the probability @xmath388 have considerable energy dependence .",
    "the required energy dependence is shown in fig .",
    "i indicate also in this figure at what energies the neutrinos produced in the various solar reactions are effective .",
    "one sees from fig .",
    "11 that essentially all @xmath353 neutrinos survive , the berylium neutrinos disappear and the flux of boron neutrinos is roughly halved .",

    "the strongest evidence is that for atmospheric neutrino oscillations coming from the superkamiokande zenith angle data . here",
    "the suggested parameters are @xmath397 , @xmath398 with @xmath399 .",
    "solar neutrinos also are strongly suggestive of oscillations . interpreting the data this way leads to @xmath400 , with @xmath398 or @xmath387 , for msw @xmath356 oscillations , or @xmath359 and @xmath398 , for  just - so \" @xmath356 oscillations .",
    "the weakest hint for oscillations probably is that of lsnd , because of other contrary evidence . at any rate ,",
    "the suggested region here is @xmath401 and @xmath402 for @xmath403 oscillations .",
    "besides neutrino oscillation phenomena , there is really no other direct evidence for neutrino masses .",
    "however , both @xmath260-decay and neutrinoless double @xmath260-decay put rather strong bounds on neutrino masses connected to @xmath167 . from @xmath260-decay",

    "note that this pattern conserves @xmath443 .",
    "since for this mass matrix @xmath444 , it follows that @xmath445 .",
    "so in this case , neutrinos do not contribute much to the energy density of the universe @xmath446 . to get solar neutrino oscillations one has to introduce some perturbation on the mass matrix ( 149 ) that will split the massive degenerate states and give @xmath447 .",
    "it seems pretty clear that progress in understanding what is going on in the neutrino sector can only come from further data .",
    "fortunately , new data will be forthcoming in all the relevant @xmath257 regions .",
    "i want to end these lectures by briefly discussing these future experiments .",
    "superkamiokande will continue to take data in years to come , thus refining their present measurements of solar neutrinos .",
    "furthermore , a real effort is taking place to lower the neutrino energy threshold further so as to be able to study the shape dependence of the signal as a function of @xmath448 .",
    "in addition to this continuing effort , relatively soon two other experiments will be coming on line which have considerable promise .",
    "the first of these is sno ( the sudbury neutrino observatory @xcite ) which uses a kiloton of d@xmath449o .",
    "the advantage of having heavy water is that it allows sno to study simultaneously both charged current and neutral current processes .",
    "the charged current process @xmath450 like all charged current processes , is sensitive to whether oscillations have occurred or not .",
    "the neutral current disintegration of the deuteron , on the other hand , is insensitive to oscillations since it is the same for all neutrino species @xmath339 : are universal",
    ". it does not apply to sterile neutrinos . ]",

    "the second solar neutrino experiment of interest is borexino .",
    "@xcite this experiment is presently under construction at the gran sasso laboratory and should be ready for data taking in 2001 .",
    "borexino uses 300 tons of scintillator , which has a relatively low threshold @xmath452 . as a result",
    ", borexino should be particularly sensitive to the @xmath453 neutrino line coming from @xmath454be .",
    "recalling fig .",
    "11 , one sees that if the msw explanation is correct , the solar neutrino signal in borexino should be significantly below the theoretical expectations .",
    "indeed , if there are no solar oscillations , borexino is supposed to detect about 50 events / day , while if the msw explanation is true , this number should go down to about 10 events / day .      here",
    "again superkamiokande will continue to integrate data with time .",
    "however , the @xmath257 region , will also be probed more directly by using neutrino beams from accelerators .",

    "first data should become available around 2001 - 2002 .",
    "finally , a variety of proposals exist for experiments in the gran sasso laboratory , which is 740 km from cern , to become targets of neutrino beams from cern .",
    "the main advantage that these long baseline experiments have over superkamiokande is that the neutrino beam used is well characterized , both in energy and in its time structure .",
    "furthermore , these beams also have a higher intensity .",
    "so many possible systematic effects will be under better control . in the case of the higher energy fermilab and cern beams",
    ", it may also be possible to directly search and detect @xmath209 s , if these neutrinos are produced in the oscillations .",
    "the @xmath251 region identified by the lsnd experiment as potentially interesting also will be explored further . at fermilab , there is an approved experiment , mini boone , @xcite which will run around 2001 - 2002 , which should be about a factor of five more sensitive than lsnd in a comparable kinematical region . with this sensitivity",
    ", it should be quite clear whether @xmath316 oscillations with @xmath455 exist or not .",

    "to understand how dirac and majorana masses can arise , it is useful to review here some of the properties of the spinor representations of the lorentz group .",
    "the lorentz group , besides the well known vector and tensor representations has also spinor representations .",
    "it turns out that there are two inequivalent spinor representations .",
    "it is out of these two - dimensional spinors that one builds up the usual four - dimensional dirac spinor @xmath59 .    under a lorentz transformation , a vector field @xmath456 has the well known transformation @xmath457 where the 4-dimensional representation matrices @xmath150 obey the pseudo - orthogonality conditions @xmath458 involving the metric tensor @xmath459~.\\ ] ]    besides vector representations , the lorentz group has two inequivalent spinor representation .",
    "the corresponding 2-dimensional weyl spinors are conventionally denoted by @xmath460 and @xmath461 , known as undotted and dotted spinors , respectively . under lorentz transformations",
    "they transform as @xmath462 the @xmath107 matrices @xmath97 and @xmath463 , with det @xmath464 , provide inequivalent representation of @xmath465 .",
    "obviously , from the above it follows that @xmath466 .",
    "one can establish a relationship between the @xmath107 matrices @xmath97 and the @xmath416 matrices @xmath150 , since the vector field @xmath456 transforms as @xmath467 .",
    "for these purposes , it is useful to define a set of four matrices @xmath468 , with @xmath469 being the usual pauli matrices .",
    "the @xmath107 matrix @xmath470 under a lorentz transformation transforms as @xmath471 using eq .",
    "( a1 ) , it follows that @xmath472    because det @xmath473 , the analogue of the scalar product for vectors @xmath474 , for the spinors @xmath475 and @xmath476 leads to the following lorentz scalars : @xmath477 where @xmath478 and @xmath479 .",
    "similarly , just as the contraction of a covariant and contravariant metric tensor gives the identity @xmath480 $ ] , one can define @xmath107 antisymmetric @xmath481-matrices , @xmath482 , which obey @xmath483 it follows that @xmath484 .",
    "the usual 4-component dirac spinor @xmath59 is made up of a dotted and an undotted weyl spinor : @xmath485 in this , so called , weyl - basis the dirac @xmath80-matrices @xmath486 , which obey the anticommutation relations @xmath487 , take the form @xmath488 here @xmath489 , so that in this basis @xmath490 and @xmath491    it follows from the above that @xmath460 and @xmath492 are * chiral projections * of @xmath59 : @xmath493 using these equations , it is easy to see that the dirac mass term connects @xmath475 with @xmath494 . specifically , one has @xmath495 recall , however , that dotted spinors are related to the complex conjugate of an undotted spinor . choosing a phase convention where @xmath496 one can write the dirac mass term simply as @xmath497 in view of eq .",
    "( a9 ) this term is obviously lorentz invariant .",
    "however , lorentz invariance does not require one to have two distinct weyl spinors @xmath475 and @xmath498 to construct a mass term .",
    "majorana masses , basically , make use of this  simpler \" option .",
    "one can define a 4-component * majorana spinor * in terms of the weyl spinor @xmath475 and its complex conjugate @xmath476 : @xmath499 because @xmath500 , effectively @xmath501 has only one independent helicity projection .",
