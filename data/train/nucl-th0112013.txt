    "the appearance of a soft collective mode of vibrational nature is quite common in nuclei and in other mesoscopic quantum systems , such as atomic clusters .",
    "the conventional theoretical way to handle this situation @xcite goes along the standard line : mean field ( mf ) @xmath0 residual interactions @xmath0 random phase approximation ( rpa ) .",
    "the mf determines the symmetry of the system around the ground state and corresponding elementary excitations , fermionic quasiparticles .",
    "the residual interactions include both coherent effects and collision - like processes responsible for the chaotization of motion and lead from a fermi - gas to fermi - liquid .",
    "the formation of coherent modes is described within the framework of the rpa where the quanta of those modes are treated as independent quasibosonic excitations @xcite . in the low - lying states ,",
    "kinematic corrections due to the fact that the quanta are built of fermions , as well as high order dynamic effects , can be accounted for perturbatively @xcite .",
    "the rpa - type theories become insufficient when , in some region of the parameters , the vibrational frequency @xmath1 approaches zero .",
    "the vibrational amplitude then grows @xmath2 revealing the instability of the mf . in a finite system , this is not necessarily a vestige of a phase transition or sharp restructuring of the system .",
    "rather it might be a signature of the failure of the theoretical consideration based on the picture of harmonic vibrations .",
    "for instance , a low energy of the first excited quadrupole state does not mean that the nucleus becomes deformed .",
    "in the regime of large amplitude collective motion , we need to reject the harmonic approximation and find a way of calculating the anharmonic effects which can not be here treated as small corrections .",
    "the estimates @xcite , as well as more detailed unrestricted mf calculations , show that in the quadrupole case the effective potential is close to the @xmath3-unstable @xcite quartic one , @xmath4 , and the spherical symmetry of the mf still holds but only on average .",
    "the popular interacting boson model @xcite with the phonon number fixed by a number of fermion pairs can not describe the soft vibrational bands which stretch to very high spins . in this sense",
    "the phenomenological models @xcite based on a specific form of the collective quadrupole hamiltonian are more successful .",
    "the onset of deformation occurs beyond the point of the rpa instability when some previously unoccupied configurations sharply lower their energy as a function of deformation and thereby select the equilibrium static value of @xmath3 , usually @xmath5 .",
    "the macroscopic analog of this scenario would be the first order phase transition .    below we consider a typical collective soft mode and show a way of constructing the effective nonperturbative anharmonic potential for large - amplitude collective motion starting with the full microscopic many - body hamiltonian .",
    "we present only the skeleton of the formalism and apply it to the lipkin model known as a testing ground of various theoretical approximations ( the first version of this approach was published in @xcite ) .",
    "it is convenient to use the operator language with the generalized density matrix ( gdm ) as the main tool @xcite .",
    "we consider a truncated single - particle space of orbitals @xmath6 of full dimension @xmath7 .",

    "we define a self - consistent field @xmath18 ( similarly to @xmath19 , an operator in the combined space ) as a linear functional of the gdm , @xmath20 the hamiltonian in eq . ( [ form_2 ] ) can also be written in terms of the gdm .",

    "now we make two crucial assumptions : ( i ) there exists a  collective band \" as a set of stationary states which are coupled by strong intraband transition amplitudes while the transitions to the states of a different nature are weak and can be ignored , or be taken into account perturbatively later ; ( ii ) the nomenclature ( quantum numbers ) of the band states can be built with the aid of the operators of collective coordinates @xmath24 and conjugate momenta @xmath25 .",
    "these assumptions are fulfilled accurately @xcite for low - lying quadrupole vibrations in medium and heavy spherical nuclei where it is known that the quadrupole transitions from the ground state are nearly saturated by the first excited @xmath26 state , which in turn gives rise to transitions to the  two - phonon \" triplet of states @xmath27 and @xmath28 , and so on .",
    "this means that there is a good correspondence between the ideal quadrupole phonon space and realistic spectra in spite of the fact that the predictions of the naive model of harmonic quadrupole vibrations are badly violated .",
    "if so , the observed states can be generated by the quadrupole coordinate and momentum operators @xmath29 and @xmath30 although the collective hamiltonian @xmath31 might be very far from the harmonic one .    according to our assumptions ,",

    "the effects of coupling to noncollective states lead to the spreading of the collective strength and the chaotization of motion in the region of high level density .",

    "one promising approach would be to consider these states on average , making the random phase assumption on a new level of treatment .",
