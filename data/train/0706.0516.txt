    "the cold dark matter ( cdm ) cosmological model predicts that massive galaxies such as the milky way should be surrounded by large numbers of dark matter - dominated satellite halos .",

    "can be broadly divided into two categories : cosmological and astrophysical .",
    "cosmological solutions include modifying the power spectrum at small scales @xcite and changing the properties of the dark matter particles , such as by making them warm @xcite or invoking a late decay from a non - relativistic particle @xcite .",
    "astrophysical solutions are more prosaic , but perhaps easier to constrain observationally .",
    "some of the most popular astrophysical solutions include the hypothesis that reionization could suppress the formation of dwarf galaxies by preventing low - mass dark matter halos from acquiring enough gas to form stars after @xmath8 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "despite a wealth of ideas about how to solve the missing dwarf problem , distinguishing between the various proposals has proved to be difficult , and making sense of the tremendous variety of masses , luminosities , mass - to - light ratios , gas fractions , and star formation histories among observed dwarf galaxies remains a challenge .",
    "our understanding of the missing satellite problem and the evolution of dwarf galaxies is being rapidly revised by the discovery of a large population of new , very faint local group dwarfs in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and other wide - field imaging surveys .",
    "in the past 3 years , at least 20 of these galaxies have been identified , nearly doubling the previously known population .",
    "the new dwarfs include 8 additional milky way dwarf spheroidals @xcite and 1 dwarf irregular @xcite , 8 new dwarf spheroidals around andromeda @xcite , and 3 further new milky way satellites that lie in the uncertain parameter space between dwarf galaxies and globular clusters @xcite .",

    "we measure radial velocities by cross - correlating the observed science spectra with a set of high signal - to - noise stellar templates .",
    "the stellar templates were observed with keck / deimos using the same set - up described above . because template mismatch can result in significant velocity errors , we include a wide variety of stellar types and metallicities in our template library : giants of spectral type f8iii through m8iii , subgiants and dwarf stars . in order to cover the range of metallicity expected in our low - luminosity dwarf galaxies ,",
    "we also include several rgb and horizontal branch ( hb ) stars taken from observations of galactic globular clusters .",
    "the stellar templates cover the metallicity range [ fe / h ] = @xmath34 to @xmath35 .",
    "all science and template spectra are rebinned onto a common wavelength array with logarithmic wavelength bins of size 15  km  s@xmath1  pixel@xmath1 , which is chosen to match the lowest spectral resolution present in the observed data .",
    "we calculate and apply a telluric correction to each velocity measurement to account for velocity errors that result from mis - centering an unresolved star within the slit .",
    "following @xcite , we cross - correlate each science spectrum with a telluric template in the regions of the strong telluric absorption : 6860 - 6925 , 7167 - 7320 , 7593 - 7690 and 8110 - 8320 .",
    "the telluric template was created from the spectrum of a hot , rapidly rotating star ( hr  1641 , b3v ) that was allowed to drift perpendicularly across the slit ( i.e. , across the 07 dimension ) during the exposure , simulating a source that uniformly fills the slit , and thus accurately reflects the mean integrated slit function .",
    "the mean telluric offset per mask ranged between @xmath36 and @xmath37 km  s@xmath1 , with a standard deviation within a mask of 3 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "this correction is the velocity error caused by the mis - centering of the science star within the slit from e.g. ,  astrometry errors , small mask rotation , etc .",
    "repeat observations of a number of stars on multiple masks demonstrate that the telluric correction reduces the mean absolute deviation between independent pairs of measurements from 4.6 to 3.8  km  s@xmath1 , reduces the weighted standard deviation of the velocity differences between pairs of measurements from 5.6 to 4.2  km  s@xmath1 , and improves the weighted mean difference from @xmath38 to @xmath39  km  s@xmath1 , indicating that the telluric correction is removing both random and systematic errors from the data .",
    "we first calculate the telluric offset ( @xmath40 ) and then determine radial velocities ( @xmath41 ) for each science spectrum . in both cases ,",
    "the template and science spectra are continuum - subtracted ; the template is then shifted and scaled to find the best fit in reduced-@xmath42 space .",
    "the final radial velocity ( @xmath43 ) is then : @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the heliocentric correction determined for each mask .",
    "all the radial velocities presented in this paper include a telluric and heliocentric correction .",
    "the internal velocity dispersions of low - luminosity dwarf galaxies are , in many cases , of the same order as the deimos velocity errors associated with individual measurements .",
    "_ in this regime , it is crucial to measure not only accurate velocities , but accurate velocity uncertainties .",
    "_ underestimating ( overestimating ) the velocity uncertainties translates directly into larger ( smaller ) values of the inferred velocity dispersion using the methods described in  [ sigma ] .",
    "we determine our velocity error bars using a monte carlo bootstrap method , determine the contribution from systematic errors via repeat measurements of individual stars , and check the precision of these errors by comparing to higher spectral resolution data .    for the monte carlo method",
    ", noise is added to each pixel in the one - dimensional spectrum of each science observation based on the observed variance in that pixel .",
    "we assume the variance in each pixel is independent and distributed according to poisson statistics .",
    "we then re - calculate the velocity and telluric correction for this new spectrum using the same routines above .",
    "error bars are defined as the square root of the variance in the recovered mean velocity over 500 runs of the simulations .",
    "we next compare these monte carlo error estimates to the velocity differences between independent repeat measurements of individual stars .",
    "since many of our deimos masks covered overlapping sky areas , we placed 43 stars on two or more masks to obtain multiple independent velocity measurements .",
    "we note that one of these stars is likely an rr lyrae variable (  [ uma2 ] ) and remove it from the sample of repeated observations .",
    "we are left with 49 pairs of independent velocity measurements . the velocity difference between these independent observations samples the ` true ' error distribution .",
    "we define a normalized error ( @xmath46 ) as the velocity difference between two independent measurements ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 ) , divided by the quadrature sum of all error contributions : @xmath49 where the monte carlo errors ( @xmath50 , @xmath51 ) on each measurement are combined in quadrature with an additional term @xmath52 equal to the error contribution from systematics not accounted for in the monte carlo simulation .",
    "the @xmath53 distribution should be a gaussian of unit width .",
    "we therefore determine the unknown contribution from other systematic errors by fitting the parameter @xmath52 to produce a unit gaussian distribution . in the left panel of figure  [ error_fig ] ,",
    "the final @xmath53 distribution is plotted for the best fitting value of @xmath54 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "the final velocity errors used in our analysis are the quadrature sum of the monte carlo and systematic errors . in the right panel of figure",
    "[ error_fig ] , we plot the final velocity errors as a function of the mean per pixel signal - to - noise ratio for all the individual stellar velocities presented in this paper .",
    "stars that fall far from the main locus of points are typically hot horizontal branch stars ( which have few sharp spectral features ) .",
    "the median velocity uncertainty for our sample of member stars in the ultra - faint dwarfs is 3.4  km  s@xmath1 ; including mask alignment stars and bright foreground stars that tend to have higher s / n , the median uncertainty for the entire data set is 2.7  km  s@xmath1 .    to demonstrate our ability to accurately measure velocities and recover velocity dispersions , we compare our observations of the galactic globular cluster ngc  2419 to higher spectral resolution keck / hires observations of the same cluster ( p.  c^ ot ' e 2007 , private communication ) .",
    "we measure radial velocities for 26  stars between @xmath55 and @xmath56 of the cluster center .",
    "the hires data contain a similar number of stars in this region , although very few stars overlap between the two data sets .",
    "the hires spectrograph has a high spectral dispersion ( 0.02  per pixel ) and much more accurate individual velocity measurements ( @xmath57  km  s@xmath1 ) .",
    "we compute the recession velocity and velocity dispersion of ngc  2419 for both data sets using the maximum - likelihood technique described in  [ sigma ] .",
    "for the recession velocity , we measure @xmath58  km  s@xmath1  compared to @xmath59  km  s@xmath1 , and for the velocity dispersion , @xmath60  km  s@xmath1  compared to @xmath61 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "the deimos observations agree within the 1-@xmath62 limits of the more accurate hires measurements .",
    "both sets of measurements agree with the published values for this cluster @xcite .",
    "while our ngc  2419 observations have somewhat higher signal - to - noise ratios than those typical of our dwarf galaxy observations , this comparison demonstrates that we are able to reliably measure the kinematics in systems with extremely low velocity dispersions ( smaller than expected for the dwarf galaxies ) .",
    "we also note that we measure a metallicity based on the ca triplet lines (  [ measure_ew ] ) for ngc  2419 of [ fe / h]@xmath63 , and the data are consistent with no intrinsic metallicity spread within the cluster .",

    "these authors presented keck / hires spectra of 7 stars in the uma  i region ( 5 members and 2 non - members ) .",
    "we re - observed all 7 stars with multiple measurements for 2 stars .",
    "we find excellent agreement between our measurements and those of @xcite  for 6 of the stars ( differences within the 1  @xmath62 uncertainties for 5 out of 6 and less than 1.7  km  s@xmath1  for all 6 ) ; for star 7 , both of our measurements are significantly discrepant with @xcite s velocity .",
    "star 7 had the lowest s / n in @xcite s observations , and they described the ca triplet lines as `` barely discernible above the noise . ''",
    "we conclude that either this star is a binary or variable star , or the velocity measured by @xcite is in error by @xmath65  km  s@xmath1  ( their estimated uncertainty is 5  km  s@xmath1 ) .",
    "radial velocities were successfully measured for 1015 of the 1460 extracted spectra across the 18  observed science masks .",
    "this total includes 50 duplicate measurements of individual stars and 124 objects identified as galaxies or quasars .",
    "the latter objects will be very useful as background objects for proper motion studies and will be the subject of a future paper . the majority of spectra for which we could not measure a redshift did not have sufficient s / n . the fitted velocities are visually inspected to insure the reliability of the measured redshift and the overall quality of the spectrum .",
    "the final sample of stellar radial velocities consists of 841  unique measurements across the eight target dwarf galaxies .",
    "we estimate the metallicity ( [ fe / h ] ) of individual rgb stars in our target galaxies using the triplet absorption lines near @xmath66 .",
    "we calculate the equivalent widths ( ews ) of the three absorption lines using the line and continuum definitions of @xcite .",

    "we assume an absolute magnitude for a metal - poor horizontal branch @xmath72 @xcite , and calculate the apparent magnitude , @xmath73 , using the distance modulus of each galaxy ( see table [ targettable ] ) .",
    "the uncertainties in the distance moduli are included in the total metallicity uncertainties we derive .",
    "note that assuming a single value for the horizontal branch magnitude in the possible presence of multiple stellar populations may add an additional @xmath74  dex to the metallicity uncertainties @xcite .",

    "the @xcite  calibration relation is derived for rgb stars in milky way globular clusters using the abundance scale of @xcite , and while the calibration data only extend to [ fe / h]@xmath77 it is reasonable to extrapolate the relation to the slightly lower metallicities found in some of our low - luminosity dwarfs ( see  [ metals ] ) .",
    "we restrict our metallicity analysis in  [ metals ] to only the rgb stars in the dwarf galaxies .    to remove foreground dwarf stars from the sample",

    "@xcite have used this feature to successfully discriminate between dwarf and giant stars for a similar spectroscopic sample .",
    "we use two complementary techniques to determine which of the observed stars are members of the dwarf galaxies and which are foreground stars .",
    "the first method classifies stars based on objective criteria : velocity , distance from the fiducial rgb and hb tracks ( corrected for foreground extinction using the reddenings from @xcite and for the distance of the galaxy ) , and the equivalent width of the 8190    absorption lines ( described above ) .",
    "the exact cutoffs for each of these parameters needed to be adjusted in a few cases , but in general we use a 3  @xmath62 cutoff in velocity ( requiring a prior iteration to estimate the velocity dispersion ) , color - magnitude distance limits ( defined as in  [ obs ] ) of 0.2  mag for rgb stars and 0.4  mag for hb stars , and a equivalent width of less than 1.0   . notable exceptions to these cutoffs include coma berenices , which is located so nearby that we detect a number of subgiants , blue stragglers , and main sequence stars at @xmath79  at these faint magnitudes we extend the allowed distance from the fiducial cmd track to 0.5  mag ; and cvn  i , which has a broad giant branch that also necessitates widening the cutoff distance from the rgb track .",
    "in addition , cvn  i has so many member stars ( 214 ) that the presence of a 3  @xmath62 outlier is likely ( and indeed we find one ) , so the velocity cutoff must be extended to 3.5  @xmath62 , where there is only a 10% chance of finding a member star in our sample .",
    "the second method is to examine individually the following properties of each star : velocity , location in the cmd , spatial position , fitted spectral type , metallicity , equivalent width , and if necessary , the spectrum . combining all of the available information about each star , and using thresholds similar to those described above ( but less rigid )",
    ", we classify each star as a likely member or non - member `` by eye '' .",
    "both of these methods are similar in spirit to the techniques described by @xcite and @xcite to separate m31 red giants from foreground main sequence stars , but without employing a full maximum - likelihood calculation , which is not necessary for these data because the dsph stars are more localized in parameter space than m31 halo stars are , and because of the higher s / n . in all cases , we find excellent agreement between the member samples identified with the two methods ( with occasional threshold tweaks required to produce a perfect match ) .",
    "a few of the galaxies contain questionable member stars that significantly affect the derived velocity dispersions , and these cases will be discussed individually in  [ comments ] .",
    "we display color - magnitude diagrams and spatial distributions for the observed stars in each dwarf galaxy in figures [ uma2_obsplot ] - [ herc_obsplot ] .      given the member samples selected in the previous subsection , we use the maximum - likelihood method described by @xcite to calculate simultaneously the mean velocities and velocity dispersions of each galaxy . and",
    "@xmath80 in equation 9 of @xcite  are negative , since they are proportional to the second derivatives of @xmath81 evaluated at the maximum of the function .",
    "the uncertainties on the mean velocity and the velocity dispersion should therefore be defined as @xmath82 and @xmath83 to avoid imaginary results . ]",

    "we therefore treat com as a bound , dark matter - dominated object for now , while recognizing that future observations ( most importantly , identification of an associated stellar stream ) could change this picture .    for the other six galaxies in our sample",
    ", we do not detect any statistically significant velocity gradients or other evidence suggesting tidal disruption .",
    "understanding the nature of the ultra - faint dwarf galaxies and determining their impact on the missing satellite problem is one of the key goals of this work .",
    "our observations show that with the likely exception of uma  ii ( and possibly coma berenices as well ) the ultra - faint dwarfs seem to be dark matter - dominated systems , with masses lower than those of the previously - known dsphs and very large mass - to - light ratios .",
    "these galaxies are currently the darkest known stellar systems in the universe .",
    "determining the importance of the effect that the new dwarfs have on the abundance of satellite galaxies around the milky way requires having a way to compare observed galaxy properties to the properties of subhalos in n - body simulations .",
    "the simplest possible approach is to estimate the halo circular velocities of the ultra - faint dwarfs as @xmath181 @xcite , assuming that the observed dispersions are equivalent to the maximum dispersions reached in each galaxy , and that the stars have negligible orbital anisotropy .",
    "although these assumptions may not be correct in detail , if we use cumulative satellite distributions then the results of this exercise are relatively insensitive to them .",
    "the circular velocities of dark matter subhalos in the simulations can be measured robustly , giving us an appropriate point of comparison .",
    "we note that a more accurate means of comparing observed dwarfs to simulated subhalos is to use the mass contained within 0.6  kpc , which is better constrained by the observations than the halo circular velocity is @xcite ; these calculations will be presented in a future paper ( strigari et al . , in preparation ) . using the above approximation",
    ", we find that the ultra - faint dwarfs have circular velocities from @xmath182  km  s@xmath1  ( for plotting and comparison purposes , we round the circular velocity of leo  iv up to 6  km  s@xmath1 ) .",
    "because the fifth data release of the sdss , where all of the new milky way satellites have been discovered , only covers 8000 deg@xmath183 of sky , we must weight each of the new dwarfs by a factor of @xmath33 to account for the additional ultra - faint dwarfs likely to be discovered once the rest of the sky has been similarly surveyed .",
    "we display the cumulative number of milky way satellites as a function of circular velocity in figure [ substructure_plot ] .",
    "we assume poisson uncertainties on the total number of dwarfs ( @xmath184 , where @xmath185 and @xmath186 refer to the previously - known and newly - discovered dwarf galaxies , respectively ) . for comparison",
    ", we include the subhalo circular velocity function from the recent via lactea simulation , currently the highest resolution ( 234 million particles ) n - body simulation of a milky way - size galaxy @xcite .",
    "this simulation assumes the best - fit wmap three - year cosmological parameters : @xmath187 , @xmath188 , @xmath189 , @xmath190 , and @xmath191 @xcite .",
    "the via lactea subhalos include all bound halos located within the virial radius ( 389  kpc ) of the main halo ( see also  [ completeness ] ) .",
    "the addition of the new dwarfs , combined with the correction for the sky area that has yet to be observed with sufficient sensitivity , substantially changes the appearance of the substructure problem .",
    "the previously - known milky way satellite galaxies have a nearly flat circular velocity function below @xmath192  km  s@xmath1 , causing a discrepancy with the predictions that worsens with decreasing mass and reaches well over an order of magnitude below @xmath193  km  s@xmath1 . with the ultra - faint dwarfs included we now see a rising circular velocity function and a satellite underabundance of a factor of @xmath7 for halos with masses between @xmath193  km  s@xmath1  and 20  km  s@xmath1 . at @xmath194",
    "km  s@xmath1  the discrepancy increases again towards an order of magnitude , but if the current observational census is still incomplete at the faint end , this is the mass range where that would manifest itself .",
    "the ultra - faint dwarfs significantly fill in the gap for satellites in the two lowest mass bins , but have masses that are too small to affect the satellite deficit at higher circular velocities .      using these new data",
    ", we can test a number of proposed astrophysical solutions to the missing satellite problem .",
    "for example , the observed dwarf galaxies could inhabit the most massive subhalos at the present day @xcite , the subhalos that collapsed at the highest redshift @xcite , or the subhalos that were the most massive at the time they were accreted by the milky way @xcite .",
    "we show the results of these tests in figures [ substruc_solns ] and [ substruc_reion ] . to compare the observed dwarfs to the most massive ( mm ) subhalos",
    ", we identified the 51 halos ( to match the number of milky way satellites projected to be found once the remainder of the sky has been surveyed ) located within the virial radius that have the largest total masses at the present day in the via lactea simulation .",
    "the circular velocity function of these subhalos is plotted as the solid cyan curve in figure [ substruc_solns ] .",
    "note that because we chose the total number of subhalos to match the total number of milky way dwarfs , the agreement between the observed distribution and the cyan curve in the lowest mass bin is trivial .",
    "another possibility is to compare the observed circular velocity function with the circular velocity function of the subhalos that were most massive when they were accreted ( dashed purple curve in figure [ substruc_solns ] ) .",
    "we selected the largest before accretion ( lba ) subhalos from the via lactea simulation as the halos located within the virial radius of the main halo at @xmath195 that had the largest circular velocities at any point in the past .",
    "again , the agreement at the low - mass end is simply a result of our choice of the top 51 subhalos from the simulation . )",
    "actually only has 46 objects with @xmath196  km  s@xmath1  because 5 of the subhalos lost so much mass by @xmath197 that they end up with even lower present - day circular velocities than are shown in the plot . ]",
    "if the observed dwarf galaxies inhabit only the most massive dark matter subhalos around the milky way , the shape of the mass function of the most massive subhalos fails to match the shape of the observed mass function .",
    "using the subhalos that were most massive at the time they were accreted instead of the ones most massive today ( i.e. , allowing for mass lost by tidal stripping ) brings the subhalo mass function slightly closer to the observed one , but there are still a factor of @xmath198 too few dwarfs in the @xmath199  km  s@xmath1  range .",
    "the final astrophysical solution we consider is that only halos that collapsed prior to reionization were able to form significant numbers of stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . among the via lactea subhalos that are located within the virial radius at @xmath197 , we select the objects with the 51 largest values of @xmath200 at various high redshifts",
    ". the results of this test are displayed in figure [ substruc_reion ] .",
    "the solid red , dashed cyan , and dotted blue curves represent the subhalos that would be selected if @xmath201 , 11.9 , and 9.6 , respectively .",
    "_ if reionization occurred around redshift @xmath202 , and dwarf galaxy formation was strongly suppressed thereafter , the circular velocity function of milky way satellite galaxies approximately matches that of cdm subhalos . _",
    "if reionization occurred at @xmath203 , we again find an underabundance of milky way dwarfs with @xmath204  km  s@xmath1  compared to theoretical models , although we note that the individual subhalo @xmath205 histories in the via lactea simulation are noisy at high redshift , and the number of objects in these bins is relatively low .",
    "we therefore suggest that the observed mass function of milky way satellite galaxies constrains reionization to have taken place before @xmath206 , in agreement with the 3-year wmap results from measurements of the cosmic microwave background ( @xmath207 ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , there are a number of caveats to this analysis : ( 1 ) the extrapolation of dwarf galaxy abundances from the sdss dr5 sky coverage to the whole sky must be reasonable , ( 2 ) the observed velocity dispersions must provide a reasonable estimate of the halo circular velocities , ( 3 ) the primary physical mechanism responsible for suppressing the formation of galaxies in low - mass dark matter halos must be reionization , ( 4 ) the cosmology used for the via lactea simulation @xcite  particularly the low value of @xmath208  must be a good match to the cosmology of our universe , and ( 5 ) the main halo simulated in via lactea must be a reasonable representation of the milky way .",
    "we also note that while wmap and most other observational probes are sensitive to the mean reionization history of the universe , the dwarf galaxies observed in the study are sensitive primarily to the reionization history _ of the local group_. if reionization was indeed responsible for the low abundance of galactic satellites , then the milky way and/or m31 must have been undergoing vigorous enough star formation to ionize the intergalactic medium of the local group at @xmath209 .",
    "one of the important assumptions involved in our analysis in   [ missingsats ] and [ solutions ] is the choice of the radius in the simulations out to which satellites should be counted . in the ideal case , this radius should be the virial radius , as we have used , but in reality the comparison between observations and simulations is only meaningful in the regime where the observations are complete .    the observational census for milky way satellite galaxies similar to the brighter dwarf spheroidals ( @xmath210 ) should be largely complete by now ; the last milky way satellite in this luminosity range to be discovered was sagittarius @xcite .",
    "recent searches of palomar sky survey data , which are sensitive to such galaxies anywhere within the local group , have not detected additional dwarfs @xcite .",
    "the distribution of milky way dwarf galaxies as a function of galactic latitude suggests that additional relatively bright dwarfs remain to be discovered at low latitudes , where extinction and foreground confusion are serious problems .",
    "the expected number of such objects if they are distributed uniformly around the galaxy is @xmath7 @xcite , which does not appear to be enough to significantly affect the missing satellite problem .",
    "very recently , @xcite have analyzed the detectability of faint milky way satellites in the sdss dr5 data .",
    "they find that extremely low - luminosity objects ( @xmath211 ) may be missed by sdss searches if they are located at relatively large distances ( @xmath212  kpc ) , as the horizontal branch and msto stars that their detection relies on become too faint to be reliably detected in the sdss .",
    "galaxies with even lower surface brightnesses than the known dwarfs ( @xmath213  mag  arcsec@xmath214 ) , if they exist , are also likely to have escaped detection . however ,",
    "if there is a correlation between surface brightness and distance from the host galaxy ( e.g. , * ?",
    "* ) or density and distance ( as our data and @xcite suggest ) , there may not be significant numbers of ultra - faint dwarfs at large distances . for more luminous dwarfs and those with higher central surface brightnesses ,",
    "the current sample of milky way satellites should be reasonably complete .",
    "the @xcite luminosity function of milky way satellite galaxies predicts that there are a total of 57 dwarf galaxies within 280  kpc of the milky way over the whole sky , and a similar number within 420  kpc .",
    "thus , our much simpler estimates of @xmath215 dwarf galaxies within 250  kpc and @xmath216 within 420  kpc from  [ missingsats ] appear to be well - justified .",
    "incompleteness may still be a significant problem at the extreme faint end of the luminosity function , as the recent discovery of botes  ii reveals @xcite .",
    "our results suggest that satellites in this luminosity range are not gravitationally - bound dwarf galaxies .",
    "if these objects are tidally disrupted dwarfs , then they should still contribute to the milky way satellite census , but if they are simply multiple fragments from larger objects ( for example , if there is a physical connection between botes and botes  ii ) or unusual globular clusters then they do not correspond to dark matter subhalos in the cdm simulations . until surveys are more complete at faint magnitudes and some kinematic information is available for this class of objects , their effect on",
    "the missing satellite problem is not clear .    in case",
    "there are undiscovered ultra - faint milky way dwarfs beyond @xmath217  kpc , we repeated our analysis of  [ missingsats ] using subhalos within 250  kpc from the main halo in the via lactea simulation ( and discarding leo  t from the observed sample because it is beyond this radius ) .",
    "this smaller radius reduces the overall number of satellite subhalos by @xmath218% , not enough to significantly change our conclusions .",
    "limiting the comparison to this radius shifts the preferred range of reionization redshifts slightly lower , but also lessens our leverage on determining the redshift of reionization .",
    "@xcite was the first to point out that observations of the dsphs known at that time suggested that they were all embedded within dark matter halos of mass @xmath219  m@xmath120 , independent of luminosity . in figure [ mateoplot ]",
    "we display an updated version of what has become popularly known as the `` mateo '' plot , showing the mass - to - light ratios of all of the local group dsphs with measured kinematics as a function of absolute magnitude .",
    "as seen previously by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , all of the galaxies observed prior to this work are approximately consistent with the picture proposed by @xcite .",
    "the results change , however , when the ultra - faint milky way satellites are added .",
    "although the brightest of the ultra - faint dwarfs still lie within the same range of halo mass as their more luminous counterparts , the fainter objects ( hercules , leo  iv , cvn  ii , and coma berenices ) are located well below the extrapolated trend .",
    "these galaxies have much lower halo masses , and hence their mass - to - light ratios are significantly smaller than what would be expected if they too were embedded in @xmath220  m@xmath120  halos . combining the new and old dwarfs , it appears that there are two distinct regimes : the brighter dwarfs ( @xmath221 ) all have similar mass dark matter halos , but for the fainter dwarfs ( @xmath222 )",
    "m / l saturates at a value of @xmath223 and the halo mass declines as luminosity decreases ( see figure [ sigmaplot]_b _ ) .",
    "it therefore appears that the ultra - faint dwarfs _ do not _ occupy halos as massive as those of the `` normal '' dsphs ; if there is a minimum halo mass for dwarf galaxies , it is not clear that the observations have yet reached it .",
    "the observed velocity dispersions and radii of the new dwarfs constrain their densities as well as their masses and mass - to - light ratios . because these galaxies are highly dark matter - dominated , the overall densities we derive are essentially equal to the density of the dark matter halo of each object . following @xcite , we can approximate the central density as    @xmath224    where @xmath225 is a numerical parameter that works out to 1 for plausible density profiles .",
    "the central densities of the new dwarfs range from @xmath226  m@xmath120  pc@xmath227 for cvn  i and hercules up to @xmath228  m@xmath120  pc@xmath227 for the faintest galaxy , coma berenices .",
    "alternatively , we can calculate mean densities from the total masses given in table [ masstable ] and the core radii . to compare with the mean densities of the previously - known milky way dsphs tabulated by @xcite",
    ", we assume that the extent of the new dwarfs is @xmath6 king core radii .",
    "again , coma berenices is the densest object , with a mean density of 0.52  m@xmath120  pc@xmath227 ( @xmath229  gev / c@xmath183  cm@xmath227 ) , almost a factor of five higher than any of the previously known dsphs .",
    "this substantially raises the limiting mass density of @xmath33  gev / c@xmath183  cm@xmath227 identified by @xcite and suggests that there may not be a true physical ceiling on the densities of dwarf galaxies ( as opposed to an observational ceiling ) at all .",
    "however , if com is in the process of tidal disruption , as our observations hint , then the highest dark matter densities in our sample occur in leo  t and cvn  ii and are only modestly above the density limit of @xcite .",
    "@xcite introduced the parameter @xmath231 as an estimate of the coarse - grained phase - space density of the dark matter in galaxy halos .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , liouville s theorem implies that observed values of @xmath232 set a hard lower limit on the original phase - space density of the dark matter . by finding the systems with the largest observed values of @xmath232",
    ", we can therefore constrain the properties of dark matter and potentially rule out classes of dark matter candidates .",
    "observations of low - mass spiral galaxies by @xcite yield lower limits of @xmath233  m@xmath120  pc@xmath227  ( km  s@xmath1)@xmath227 on @xmath232 ( * ? ? ?",

    "these values are calculated under the assumption that the velocity dispersion of the dark matter ( which is what @xmath232 actually depends on ) is equal to the velocity dispersion of the stars .",
    "our observations show that most of the ultra - faint dwarfs greatly exceed the phase - space density constraint from the ly-@xmath234 forest , reaching a maximum of @xmath235  m@xmath120  pc@xmath227  ( km  s@xmath1)@xmath227 in coma berenices .",

    "the ultra - faint milky way satellites are dark matter - dominated dwarf galaxies with lower masses than any other known galaxies . 2 .   the only clear exception among the 8 galaxies we observed , as well as those previously observed by others , is ursa major  ii . based on its clumpy appearance @xcite , small galactocentric distance @xcite , associated tidal stream ( * ? ? ? *  [ comments ] ) , inflated velocity dispersion (  [ sigma ] ) , unusually high metallicity (  [ metals ] ) , and possible velocity gradient (  [ comments ] ) , we conclude that uma  ii is in the late stages of tidal disruption . the other dwarf with @xmath263 , coma berenices ,",
    "has a similarly high metallicity that indicates it may have suffered substantial tidal stripping as well . because com lacks most of the other supporting evidence for tidal disruption , we assume for now that it is still a bound , dark matter - dominated dwarf , although we recognize that future observations may show otherwise . based on these results , we suggest that @xmath264 ( @xmath265  l@xmath120 ) is the lower limit to the luminosity of gravitationally - bound dwarf galaxies .",
    "we therefore predict that objects such as willman 1 , segue 1 , and bo \" otes ii will prove to be tidally - disrupted remnants .",
    "3 .   the 6 ultra - faint dwarfs with @xmath266 follow the luminosity - metallicity relationship established by the more luminous local group dwarfs , and extend the relation by @xmath6 orders of magnitude in luminosity .",
    "the faintest dwarfs , uma  ii and com , are both outliers from this relationship , with metallicities more than 0.5 dex too large for their luminosities ( or conversely , luminosities that are more than two orders of magnitude too small for their metallicities ) .",
    "we detect metallicity spreads of up to 0.5  dex in several objects , suggesting multiple star formation epochs .",
    "the total mass - to - light ratios of the ultra - faint dwarfs reach as high as 1000  m@xmath3l@xmath4  ( uma  i ) .",
    "while the brighter galaxies ( @xmath267 ) have mass - to - light ratios consistent with the hypothesis that all dwarf spheroidals are embedded within dark matter halos of the same mass , the fainter galaxies depart from this trend in the sense that their mass - to - light ratios are too low ( i.e. , they have lower masses ) .",
    "we therefore suggest that the minimum _ mass _ for dwarf galaxies ( as opposed to the minimum luminosity mentioned earlier ) , if there is one , may not have been reached yet .",
    "the ultra - faint milky way satellites , after correcting for the sky area not covered by dr5 of the sloan survey , substantially increase the abundance of dwarf galaxies with very low masses ( @xmath268  km  s@xmath1 ) , thereby reducing the satellite deficit compared to cdm simulations to a factor of @xmath7 .",

    "<S> . the measured velocity dispersions of the ultra - faint dwarf galaxies are correlated with their luminosities , indicating that a minimum mass for luminous galactic systems may not yet have been reached . </S>",
    "<S> we also measure the metallicities of the observed stars and find that several of the new dwarfs have mean metallicities as low as [ fe / h ] = @xmath5 ; these galaxies represent some of the most metal - poor known stellar systems . </S>",
    "<S> the 6 brightest of the ultra - faint dwarfs extend the luminosity - metallicity relationship followed by more luminous dwarfs by @xmath6 orders of magnitude in luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> we detect metallicity spreads of up to 0.5  dex in several objects , suggesting multiple star formation epochs . </S>",
    "<S> uma  ii and com , despite their exceptionally low luminosities , have higher metallicities that suggest they may once have been much more massive . </S>",
    "<S> having established the masses of the ultra - faint dwarfs , we re - examine the missing satellite problem . </S>",
    "<S> after correcting for the sky coverage of the sloan digital sky survey , we find that the ultra - faint dwarfs substantially alleviate the discrepancy between the predicted and observed numbers of satellites around the milky way , but there are still a factor of @xmath7 too few dwarf galaxies over a significant range of masses . </S>",
    "<S> we show that if galaxy formation in low - mass dark matter halos is strongly suppressed after reionization , the simulated circular velocity function of cdm subhalos can be brought into approximate agreement with the observed circular velocity function of milky way satellite galaxies . </S>"
