    "the spinor helicity formalism ( shf ) is a tool for calculating scattering amplitudes much more efficiently than the traditional approach .",
    "its versatility is based on the fact that all objects appearing in the feynman rules for quantum field theories such as qed , qcd , ew and susy can be written in terms of two - component weyl spinors ( and pauli sigma matrices ) . dotted and undotted",
    "weyl spinors are used , and in some sense they could be considered more fundamental than minkowski four - vectors since they form irreducible representations of the lorentz group , unlike dirac spinors which are a `` mixture '' ( i.e. a direct sum ) of two different representations .",
    "when dealing with a massless fermion , the solutions of the momentum - space dirac equation only has two non - vanishing components , in that case the distinction between a 4-component dirac spinor and a 2-component weyl spinor essentially disappears .",
    "these weyl spinors , which are helicity eigenstates in the massless case , can then be used to rewrite the feynman rules for external legs ( both fermionic and bosonic ) , vertices and propagators .",
    "the expressions obtained for the helicity amplitudes are in general very simple , and they can be squared directly , without any need of spinor completeness relations and casimir tricks .",
    "this is one of the most marvelous advantages of both massless and massive shf .",
    "the shf usually concentrates on the massless case ( see references @xcite-@xcite ) , while the massive formalism has been less studied in the current literature .",
    "the only notable exception is ref .",
    "@xcite , although it is written in a somewhat old - fashioned notation .",
    "other papers , such as @xcite-@xcite , study scattering amplitudes of several theories using mostly bcfw recursion ( britto - cachazo - feng - witten ) @xcite , creating a gap between the well - understood massless shf and the work done in the massive shf even for `` simpler '' theories such as qed . in the massive case ,",
    "the simplifications are not that large , the method is in general a little bit more tricky than the massless case @xcite .",
    "finally , we must say that one of the main applications of the modern amplitude calculation techniques is to qcd gluon processes . using recursion relations such as bcfw",
    ", one can calculate multi - gluon scattering amplitudes which would be impossible ( in practice ) to obtain using `` traditional '' methods .",
    "of course , gluons are massless , so one does not need to extend the shf to include massive particles in this case .",
    "computational tools have been developed to deal with both massless and massive spinor helicity amplitudes ( see refs . @xcite and @xcite ) , which of course comes very handy when dealing with complicated processes .",
    "however , one can notice that a self - contained theory of massive helicity amplitudes and detailed applications to simple processes of realistic theories is lacking , which is one of the motivations of this paper .",
    "in this work we show some practical examples where we have applied the massive shf to several processes ( at tree level ) in the electroweak sm .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : section [ section2 ] contains the solutions of the dirac equation ( massive case ) , as well the solutions of the maxwell and proca equations in order to derive the feynman rules for external fermionic and bosonic lines , then we use the so - called light cone decomposition ( lcd ) @xcite to express massive fermions in terms of massless ones . in section [ section3 ]",
    "we present some calculations in electroweak sm .",
    "finally in section [ conclussions ] we present our conclusions and final comments of this work .",
    "consider a theory with a massive dirac fermion , which is described by dirac equation .",
    "writing the momentum space dirac spinor @xmath4 in terms of two weyl spinors the equation of motion takes the form @xmath5 through all the paper we shall use the following spacetime metric @xmath6 , also we have used the base where the dirac matrices take the following form @xmath7 with @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "weyl spinor ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) could be expressed in terms of brackets ( angle and square ) spinors , they read as @xmath12 , \\ , \\xi=\\frac{m}{\\langle rq\\rangle}|q\\rangle$ ] where @xmath13 $ ] and @xmath14 are 2-component weyl spinors linked to the light - like momenta @xmath15 and @xmath16 , with the spinor indices being omitted .",
    "they arise when one uses lcd to express a massive momentum ( @xmath17 ) in term of 2 massless momenta ( @xmath18 ) , this approach will be used throughout the paper to express massive spinors in terms of massless ones .",
    "equation ( [ pspace_dirac_eq ] ) has 4 solutions , ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a complete derivation ) , these are : @xmath19+\\frac{m}{{\\langle}rq{\\rangle}}|q{\\rangle } , \\quad      u_+(p)=\\frac{m}{[rq]}|q]+|r{\\rangle},\\ ] ] @xmath20-\\frac{m}{{\\langle}rq{\\rangle}}|q{\\rangle } , \\quad      v_-(p)=-\\frac{m}{[rq]}|q]+|r{\\rangle},\\ ] ] with the conjugate solutions given by @xmath21}[q|+{\\langle}r| , \\quad \\bar{u}_+(p)=[r|+\\frac{m}{{\\langle}qr{\\rangle}}{\\langle}q|,\\ ] ] @xmath22}[q|+{\\langle}r| , \\quad \\bar{v}_-(p)=[r|-\\frac{m}{{\\langle}qr{\\rangle}}{\\langle}q| . \\label{equ:17}\\ ] ]    spinor products satisfy @xmath23\\equiv-[qr]$ ] , similarly @xmath24 . for real momenta",
    "we have @xmath25^\\ast $ ] .",
    "when @xmath26 , one can verify that @xmath27 .",
    "equations ( [ equ:14])-([equ:17 ] ) will allow us to compute scattering amplitudes in a more practical way than the traditional approach .",
    "for massless spin-1 particles , one can write the transversal polarization vectors as follows @xmath28}{\\sqrt{2}{\\langle}qp { \\rangle}}$ ] and @xmath29}{\\sqrt{2}[qp]}$ ] , see ref.@xcite , where @xmath30 is the spin-1 momentum , and @xmath31 is a reference momentum defined such that @xmath32 .",
    "note that @xmath33 .",
    "the slashed versions of these polarization vectors will also be useful to compute scattering amplitudes in the examples presented later , these are @xmath34 { \\langle}q| + |q { \\rangle}[p| \\right)$ ] and @xmath35 } \\left ( |p{\\rangle}[q| + |q ] { \\langle}p| \\right ) $ ] . finally , for massive spin-1 bosons",

    "in this section we will use the shf to compute several elementary processes in the standard model of particle physics . considering massive particles but using lcd",
    ", we shall express the massive 4-component dirac spinor in terms of the massless 2-component weyl spinors .",
    "this will allow us to exploit all the available identities from the massless shf .",
    "the helicity amplitude ( ha ) for the process @xmath43 reads as follows @xmath44 where @xmath45 , @xmath46 and the @xmath47 s represent the helicity of the particles .",
    "we shall use simultaneous light cone decomposition ( slcd ) to express the massive momenta @xmath48 and @xmath49 in terms of massless momenta ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "the massive momenta take the form ; @xmath51 and @xmath52 , here slcd implies that @xmath53 and @xmath54 . for this process",
    "there are @xmath55 ha s , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "using slcd to fix the massless momenta will be crucial to reduce the number of ha s , in this case ha s : @xmath59 vanish .",
