    "<S> matter wave interferometry is a highly sensitive tool to measure small perturbations in a quantum system . </S>",
    "<S> however , due to their sensitivity , interferometers are susceptible to dephasing mechanisms such as mechanical vibrations . </S>",
    "<S> this is especially a problem for precision measurements under perturbing conditions that can not be perfectly decoupled , such as for mobile interferometric devices or vibrations with a broad frequency range . here , </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate a method to reveal the original contrast and spatial periodicity of the interference pattern from `` washed - out '' matter wave interferograms that have been vibrationally disturbed in the frequency region between 100 and . </S>",
    "<S> the approach is based on second - order correlation theory in combination with fourier analysis , using the high spatial and temporal single particle resolution of a delay line detector . </S>",
    "<S> other than with electromagnetic dephasing , the parts in the setup have various mechanical resonances and therefore oscillate with frequencies that could be harmonics of the applied ones . </S>",
    "<S> our algorithm is able to determine those unknown oscillations and corresponding amplitudes and to restore the interferometer contrast . </S>",
    "<S> the setup can therefore also be applied as a sensor for perturbation frequencies from the environment . </S>",
    "<S> we describe the method in detail and demonstrate it in an electron biprism interferometer . </S>",
    "<S> the universal technique can identify vibrational dephasing and decrease damping and shielding requirements in electron , ion , neutron , atom and molecule interferometers . </S>"
