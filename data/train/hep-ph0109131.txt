    "recently a new measurement of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon became available , which suggests a possible 2.6 standard deviation from the standard model ( sm ) expectation@xcite : @xmath3 .",
    "the most popular explanation is given in the framework of susy theories@xcite .",
    "to explain the desired difference @xmath4 it requires the higgs mixing parameter to be positive @xcite and the sparticles contributing to the chargino - sneutrino @xmath5 and neutralino - smuon @xmath6 loop diagrams to be relatively light@xcite .",
    "the positive sign of @xmath7 is also preferred by the branching ratio of the b - quark decaying radiatively into an s - quark - @xmath0-@xcite .",
    "the error on the @xmath0measurements is still so large ( at least 15% ) , that it does not give a significant constraint on the sparticle masses .",
    "however , it prefers the trilinear coupling at the gut scale @xmath8 to be positive for light sparticles . in this case of @xmath9 the lower limit on the higgs mass of 114 gev@xcite becomes the most effective lower limit on the sparticle masses . without the @xmath0constraint , which implies arbitrary values of @xmath8 , the lower limit on the sparticle masses is determined by @xmath0 .",
    "lack of space forces us to refer the reader to ref.@xcite for details .",
    "= 0.8 = 0.9 [ bsggm2 ]",
    "to find out the allowed regions in the parameter space of the cmssm , we fitted both the @xmath10 and @xmath2 data simultaneously@xcite .",
    "the fit includes the following constraints : i ) the unification of the gauge couplings , ii ) radiative elctroweak symmetry breaking , iii ) the masses of the third generation particles , iv ) @xmath10 and @xmath4 , v ) experimental limits on the susy masses , vi ) the lightest superparticle ( lsp ) has to be neutral to be a viable candidate for dark matter .",
    "we assume common gut scale mass parameters , i.e. @xmath11 for the spin 0 sparticles and @xmath12 for the spin 1/2 gauginos .",
    "in addition the usual cmssm parameters at the gut scale ( higgs mixing parameter @xmath7 , @xmath13 and trilinear coupling @xmath8 ) are varied .",
    "since @xmath2 and @xmath0both have loop corrections with charginos their susy contributions are correlated , as shown in fig .",
    "[ bsggm2 ] ( top ) : the large positive susy contributions to @xmath2 for light sparticles correspond to negative contributions for @xmath0 . the bottom of fig .",
    "[ bsggm2 ] shows the combined @xmath1 contributions in the @xmath11 , @xmath12 plane , both in 3d and 2d . for the preferred positive values of @xmath8",
    "the higgs bound of 114 gev from lep@xcite becomes an effective lower limit on @xmath12 of about 300 gev , as shown on the right hand bottom side of fig .",
    "[ bsggm2 ] . if @xmath8 is fixed at 0 , the lower limit on @xmath12 is given by @xmath0@xcite .",
    "these fits were made for @xmath14 .",
    "lower values decrease the allowed area , for larger values the lsp limit becomes more severe@xcite .",
    "the 95% upper limit on @xmath12 is determined by the lower limit on @xmath15 and therefore depends on . for = 35(50 ) one finds @xmath16 gev , which implies that the lightest chargino is below 530(620 ) gev and the lightest neutralino is below 270(310 ) gev .",
    "it should be noted that this upper limit strongly depends on the vacuum polarization contributions to the fine structure constant .",
    "recent evaluations reduce @xmath4 from a 2.6 @xmath17 effect to less than 2 @xmath17@xcite , which increases the upper limits given above by about 25% .",
