    "the quasi - two - dimensional compound srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 has attracted a lot of attention over the past ten years due to its spin - gapped behavior , its finite magnetization below the critical magnetic field deduced from the spin gap , and more importantly its magnetization plateaus at 1/8 , 1/4 and 1/3 of the saturated magnetization .",
    "@xcite based on the quasi - two - dimensional structure of the compound and on a number of experimental facts , the hamiltonian expected to provide an accurate description of the magnetic properties of that compound must include both heisenberg symmetric exchange processes and antisymmetric dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) interactions .",
    "it is defined by : @xmath2 + \\vec d ' \\sum_{n.n.n } [ \\vec s_{i } \\times \\vec s_{j } ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where j ( @xmath3 ) and @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) define intra- and inter - dimer symmetric ( dzyaloshinskii - moriya ) exchange interactions .",
    "the heisenberg model obtained when @xmath3 and @xmath5 are set to zero is known as the shastry - sutherland model@xcite .",
    "the susceptibility and the main features of the magnetization curve have been interpreted in the context of this shastry - sutherland model , leading to estimates of @xmath6 and @xmath4 , while the dispersion of triplet excitations , the low - field uniform and staggered magnetizations and esr measurements have provided estimates of the dm interactions",
    ". a very useful complementary source of information is usually given by first - principles calculations , which have provided valuable results even in low - dimensional quantum spin systems with complex structures .",

    ", we report on the first ab - initio investigation of the electronic structure and magnetic properties of srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 .",
    "our results show that an accurate treatment of the oxygen magnetization is crucial for the description of isotropic exchange interactions in srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 . in order to calculate the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interactions between magnetic moments ,",
    "we have used the microscopic expression derived by moriya.@xcite for that purpose , the hopping integrals between different wannier orbitals centered at cu atoms have been obtained using a projection procedure .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section , we shortly describe the crystal structure of srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 and present the results of lda calculations . sec.iii and iv contain the analysis of the isotropic and anisotropic exchange interactions , the results of lsda+u calculations are presented in sec.v .",

    "the results of the previous section demonstrate that within lda the srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 has a metallic ground state .",
    "this is a standard lda problem for transition metal oxides and in order to overcome it one should take into account on - site correlations in the electronic density functional . despite this problem ,",
    "a microscopic description of magnetic couplings is still possible on the basis of lda . in order to demonstrate this , we construct a model hamiltonian describing srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 in the wannier function basis .",
    "this hamiltonian is set to reproduce only four bands of the full hamiltonian near the fermi level ( fig.3 ) .",
    "we express the lda structure results in terms of a low - energy , few orbital model hamiltonian using a projection procedure.@xcite let us first consider the one - orbital tight - binding hamiltonian in the wannier functions basis @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the hopping integral between wannier functions centered on the 3d@xmath19 orbitals of _ i_th and _ j_th sites . to simplify the analysis we divide the calculated hopping integrals into two subgroups : intraplane ( fig.6 ) and interplane ( fig.7 ) couplings .",

    "the interplane hopping integrals have the values : t@xmath31=t@xmath32=8 mev and t@xmath33 = t@xmath34= t@xmath35= t@xmath36 = 12 mev .",
    "using these hopping parameters , one can estimate the magnetic couplings of srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0 .",
    "since the wannier orbitals have a strong contribution from the wave functions of the oxygen atoms , it is not enough to use the simple formula @xmath37 .",
    "there is an additional ferromagnetic contribution originating from hund s rule intra - atomic exchange interaction of the oxygen@xcite , which leads to the formula : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the number of oxygen atoms between coppers and @xmath15 is the contribution of atomic wave functions of oxygen to the wannier orbitals . u@xmath40 and @xmath41 are on - site coulomb interactions of copper atom and intra - atomic exchange interaction of oxygen , respectively .",
    "the former interaction can be estimated within constrained lda , which gives u@xmath40=8.4 ev . according to spin - polarized lsda+u calculations @xcite @xmath42 = 1.6 ev .",
    "the value of the copper magnetic moment obtained by lsda+u calculations is 0.72 @xmath43 .",
    "one can estimate @xmath44 through the magnetic moment of the oxygen atom in the ferromagnetic configuration simulated in lsda+u calculations ( table iii ) : @xmath44 = m(o)/2=0.05 . using eq.(3 ) and",
    "the parameters defined above leads to : @xmath45 = 10.2 mev .",
    "the value of @xmath45 is larger than that derived from experimental data .",
    "the problem might be that eq.(3 ) is sensitive to the form of the wannier functions .",
    "for instance , if @xmath46 was equal to 0.054 ( instead of 0.05 ) , then @xmath45 would be equal to 7.5 mev , in excellent agreement with the experimental value .",
    "a detailed comparison of our results for the magnetic couplings with those extracted from experiments is presented in section vi .    on the other hand",
    ", there is no overlap at oxygen atom between wannier functions which belong to different dimers and therefore the inter - dimer interactions can be calculated using the standard expression : @xmath47 this leads to @xmath48=3.6 mev , @xmath49=0.2 mev , @xmath50=0.13 mev , @xmath51 = 0.06 mev and @xmath52 = 0.13 mev .",
    "in a pioneer investigation , moriya @xcite pointed out two main contributions to the anisotropic exchange interaction .",
    "the first one is the kinetic dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction , which can be expressed in the following form : @xmath53,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 and @xmath55 denote the ground state wannier orbitals centered at the _ i_th and _ j_th sites , while @xmath56 and @xmath57 are transfer integrals without and with spin - orbit coupling . in the case of srcu@xmath7(bo@xmath8)@xmath7",
    ", the ground state wannier function is centered on the 3d@xmath19 orbital of copper .",
    "if the energy difference between the ground state and the excited states is larger than the spin - orbit coupling , then we can treat the spin - orbit interaction as a perturbation . in this case",
    "@xmath58 is given by @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the spin - orbit coupling constant , @xmath61 is the matrix element of the orbital angular momentum between the _",
    "m_th excited state and the _ n_th ground state wannier functions which are centered at _",
    "i_th ion , while @xmath62 represents the energy of the _ n_th wannier orbital at the _",
    "i_th ion .",
    "the second contribution to anisotropic exchange interactions is of coulomb interaction origin , @xcite and is given by @xmath63 where @xmath64 is a kind of inter - site coulomb exchange interaction which is non - diagonal with respect to the orbitals . assuming that the wannier functions of @xmath65 symmetry are ground state orbitals , these intersite coulomb exchange interaction integrals can be expressed in the atomic wave function basis in the following form : @xmath66 and @xmath67 one can estimate these integrals through complex spherical harmonics and slater integrals .",
    "@xcite we found that , due to symmetry , both integrals of eq.(8 ) and eq.(9 ) are identically zero .",
    "therefore , we only consider the kinetic dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction in the following .    to perform the microscopic analysis and calculate the kinetic dzyaloshinskii - moriya interactions , we define the hopping parameters of the following general tight - binding hamiltonian that includes five wannier orbitals centered at cu sites : @xmath68 where @xmath69 . using the projection procedure",

    "this is due to the fact that the hybridization between filled and vacant orbitals is explicitly taken into account in the five - orbital model .",
    "we can estimate the isotropic exchange interactions in the case of the five - orbital model using eq.(3 ) , @xmath45 = 7.8 mev , @xmath48=3.5 mev , @xmath49 = 0.23 mev , @xmath50 = 0.15 mev , @xmath51 = 0.13 mev and @xmath52 = 0.09 mev .",

    "+ @xmath80 green s function approach .",
    "the presence of a finite magnetization well below the expected critical field for the gap closing is a manifestation of the fact that triplet states are mixed into the ground state .",
    "this is an effect of the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction .",
    "the directions ( fig.8 ) and values ( table ii ) of calculated dzyaloshinskii - moriya vectors agree well with those obtained from the interpretation of neutron , esr and nmr experiments.@xcite for instance , the intra - dimer anisotropic vector is perpendicular to the bond direction .",

    "it is found that the ferromagnetic contribution of the intra - atomic exchange interactions of oxygen plays a crucial role to account for the intra - dimer isotropic exchange interaction .",
    "the microscopic origin of dzyaloshinskii - moriya interactions has been analyzed using calculated hopping integrals between different wannier orbitals of copper atoms . in general , there are two contributions to anisotropic exchange interaction which are kinetic and coulomb dzyaloshinskii - moriya interactions . in the case of srcu@xmath0(bo@xmath1)@xmath0",
    "the coulomb contribution is zero by symmetry .",
    "however , we expect that the latter plays important role in the case of more distorted frustrated cuprates such as cu@xmath7te@xmath7o@xmath83(br , cl)@xmath7 and ( tl , k)cucl@xmath8 .",
