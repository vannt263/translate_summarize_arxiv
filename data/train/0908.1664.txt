    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    within newtonian theory , the gravitational two - body problem , in its basic form , is readily solvable .",
    "an isolated system of two gravitationally - bound point masses admits two conserved integrals  the energy and angular momentum  and the resulting motion is precisely periodic .",
    "the corresponding _ general - relativistic _ problem is radically  and notoriously  more difficult . in general relativity ( gr ) , the orbits in a bound binary are never periodic : gravitational radiation continually removes energy and angular momentum from the system , and the radiation back - reaction gradually drives the two objects tighter together until they eventually merge .",
    "furthermore , in gr one can not usually work consistently with pointlike mass particles ( as we discuss later ) , and the simplest and most universal two - body problem becomes that of a binary black hole system .    in general , the description of the nonlinear radiative dynamics of a black hole binary entails a full numerical - relativistic ( nr ) treatment .",
    "there has been a much celebrated advance in nr research in the past few years @xcite , with nr codes now capable of tracking the complicated nonlinear evolution of a binary black hole spacetime during the final stages of the merger .",
    "however , nr methods become less efficient when the two black holes are far apart , or when one of the components is much heavier than the other .",
    "each of these two regimes features two greatly different lengthscales , which is not easily accommodated in a nr framework @xcite .",
    "fortunately , the occurrence of two separate lengthscales also restores a sense of `` pointlikeness '' ( at least approximately ) , which allows for simpler , perturbative treatments . in the first regime  at sufficiently large separations ",
    "the dynamics is best analyzed using post - newtonian ( pn ) methods @xcite , wherein gr corrections to the newtonian dynamics ( accounting for radiation reaction , the objects internal structure , etc . )",
    "are incorporated into the equations of motion order by order in the binary separation .",
    "the second , so - called _ extreme mass - ratio _ regime  which will concern us in this review  is most naturally explored within the framework of black hole perturbation theory . here",
    "the `` zeroth - order '' configuration is that of a test particle ( the lighter black hole ) moving along a geodesic of the fixed background spacetime of the large black hole .",
    "this can then serve as a basis for a systematic expansion , wherein corrections due to the finite mass of the small object ( and due possibly also to its internal structure ) are included order by order in the small mass ratio . at first order in the mass ratio , the gravitational field of the small object is a linear perturbation of the background black hole geometry .",
    "the back reaction from this perturbation gives rise to a gravitational _ self force _",
    "( sf ) which gradually diverts the small object from its geodesic motion . in this picture",
    ", it is the sf that is responsible ( in particular ) for the radiative decay of the orbit . in principle ,",
    "knowledge of the sf ( along with the metric perturbation ) forms a complete picture of the orbital dynamics at linear order in the small mass ratio .",
    "one therefore hopes that a calculation of the sf would facilitate a faithful , if only approximate description of the orbital dynamics in binary systems with small mass ratios .",
    "the determination of the sf in curved spacetime is an old problem in mathematical relativity , made very relevant following recent developments in gravitational - wave research .",
    "interest in this problem was renewed in the mid 1990s , when it was first proposed that the planned space - based gravitational wave detector lisa ( the laser interferometer space antenna @xcite ) could observe signals from the inspiral of compact objects ( white dwarfs , neutron stars , or stellar - mass black holes ) into massive black holes in galactic nuclei .",
    "it is now believed that lisa should be able to detect tens to thousands such events @xcite , out to cosmological distances ( @xmath1 ) @xcite depending on the astrophysical rates ( inspirals per galaxy per year ) , which are still highly uncertain . dubbed _",
    "emri_s ( extreme mass ratio inspirals ) , these potential sources became key targets for lisa due to their unique facility as precision probes of strong - field gravity .",
    "a typical lisa emri will spend the last few years of inspiral in a very tight orbit around the massive hole , emitting some @xmath2@xmath3 gravitational wavecycles wholly within the lisa frequency band .",
    "these complicated waveforms carry extremely accurate information about the physical parameters of the inspiral system , as well as a detailed map of the spacetime geometry around the massive hole .",
    "the potential scientific implications are broad and far - reaching , ranging from astrophysics to cosmology and to fundamental theory @xcite .",
    "the odds are that even the strongest detected emri signals will be buried deeply inside lisa s instrumental noise . however , since an emri signal is detectable over a long time , it can be extracted with significant signal - to - noise ratio ( of order @xmath4 for the strongest sources ) using _ matched filtering _ @xcite .",
    "this , however , requires precise theoretical templates of emri waveforms across the relevant parameter space of inspirals  indeed , the detection statistics cited above assumes that such templates were at hand by the time lisa flies .",
    "it is likely that other , non - template - based data analysis techniques could be used to detect some of the brightest emris @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , it remains true that an accurate parameter extraction , crucial for exploiting the full scientific value of the emri signal , will rely on ( or be restricted by ) the availability of accurate and faithful theoretical templates of the inspiral waveforms .",
    "the theoretical challenge is derived from the astrophysical specifications of the lisa - relevant emris . with its peak sensitivity at a few mhz",
    ", lisa will observe inspirals into galactic ( likely kerr ) black holes with masses in the range @xmath5@xmath6 ; the inspiraling objects ( compact stars or stellar - mass black holes ) may have masses in the range @xmath7@xmath8 , giving mass ratios of @xmath9@xmath10well within the `` extreme mass ratio '' domain of the two - body problem .",
    "inspirals are not expected to have any preferred orientation with respect to the central hole s spin direction , and orbits may remain quite eccentric throughout the inspiral @xcite .",
    "it is not likely that interaction with a possible accretion disk around the massive hole would play a dominant role in the orbital dynamics @xcite . in a typical lisa - band emri  a @xmath11 system",
    " gravitational radiation reaction drives the orbital decay over a timescale of months .",
    "more importantly , it affects the phasing of the inspiral orbit over mere hours .",
    "it is therefore clear that a useful model of the long - term orbital phase evolution in a lisa - relevant system ought to incorporate properly the effect of radiation reaction .",
    "the above translates , at first approximation , to a very clean problem in black hole perturbation theory : a point mass is set in a generic ( eccentric , inclined ) strong - field orbit around a kerr black hole of a much larger mass , and one wishes to calculate the gravitational waveforms emitted as radiation reaction drives the gradual inspiral up until the eventual plunge through the event horizon . while it remains important to quantify the effect of higher - order corrections to this picture ( e.g. , due to the spin of the inspiralling object ) , one expects that , thanks to the extreme mass ratio , the above simple setup should provide a good model for astrophysical inspirals .",
    "indeed , from the perspective of gr theorists working in the field , much of the appeal of the sf problem comes from its unusual dual nature as both an elementary theoretical problem in gr , and an exciting problem in contemporary astrophysics .",

    "our discussion will be focused mostly on work concerned with the evaluation of the sf along a specified , non - evolving orbit ( normally taken to be a geodesic of the background spacetime ) ; we will not consider here the important question of how orbits evolve under the effect of the sf .",
    "the strategic approach envisaged here is one in which the complete analysis of the orbital evolution is carried out in two separate , consequent steps . in the first , preparatory step",
    ", one calculates the sf across the entire relevant phase space ( i.e. , obtain the value of the sf as a function of location and velocity , perhaps through interpolation of numerical results ) . in the second step one then uses the sf information to calculate the inspiral orbits of particles with given initial conditions .",
    "here we will be concerned only with the first , most crucial step .    in parallel to the work on sfs described in this review ,",
    "there is already a substantial research effort aimed to formulate a reliable scheme for the orbital evolution , assuming the sf has been calculated @xcite .",
    "this work incorporates techniques from multiple - scale perturbation theory .",

    "this work is largely based on a strategy proposed by mino @xcite , in which a time - average measure of the rate of change of the geodesic `` constants of motion '' is calculated from a certain `` radiative '' solution of the perturbation equations ( to be described later in this review ) , which accounts for the long - term radiative aspects of the dynamics but neglects some of the conservative effects .",

    "we use greek letters for spacetime indices , and adopt standard geometrized units ( with @xmath18 ) throughout .",
    "the concept of a gravitational force is , of course , fundamentally strange to gr : in a purely gravitational system one expects no acceleration and hence no `` forces '' in the ordinary sense . since the gravitational sf is an example of a force of a purely gravitational origin , we begin by explaining what is generally meant by `` gravitational forces '' in our context .",
    "consider a smooth region of spacetime with metric @xmath19 ( which may be , for example , the stationary vacuum exterior of a kerr black hole ) , and a smooth weak gravitational perturbation @xmath20 of that spacetime ( which may represent , for example , an incident gravitational wave ) . now",
    "consider a test particle of mass @xmath21 which is moving freely in the perturbed spacetime .",
    "neglecting sf effects , the particle s trajectory will be a geodesic of the perturbed spacetime , described , in a given coordinate system @xmath22 , by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is an affine parameter along the trajectory and @xmath25 are the connection coefficients associated with the perturbed metric @xmath26 .    in some occasions , however , it is practically useful to reinterpret the particle s motion in terms of a trajectory in the background spacetime @xmath27 . under this interpretation , the trajectory ( in @xmath27 ) is no longer geodesic ; rather , the particle experiences `` an external gravitational force '' , which is exerted by the perturbation @xmath28 .",
    "this ( fictitious ) force is defined through newton s second law as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is an affine parameter in the background metric @xmath27 , and @xmath31 are the connection coefficients associated with @xmath27 .",
    "note that , in this non - covariant description , @xmath28 and @xmath32 are treated as tensor fields in @xmath27 , and similarly the force @xmath33 and four - velocity @xmath34 are defined as vectors in @xmath27 .",
    "the tensorial indices of all these quantities are raised and lowered using the background metric @xmath27 .",

    "the differential operator @xmath46 determines the gravitational force exerted by any given external perturbation ; it is given explicitly by @xmath47 later we will often work with the trace - reversed metric perturbation , @xmath48 in terms of @xmath49 , eq .",
    "( [ eq1:50 ] ) becomes @xmath50 with @xmath51 formally , the above interpretation of the motion requires a suitable procedure for mapping the physical trajectory from the full spacetime @xmath26 onto the background spacetime @xmath27 . in the above discussion we adopted the following procedure : first , we assume that @xmath26 and @xmath27 were covered with two coordinate meshes that are `` similar '' in the sense that , at the limit @xmath52 , any given physical event would attain the same coordinate values in both spacetimes .",
    "then , we identify each event @xmath22 in @xmath26 with an event having the same coordinate value @xmath22 in @xmath27 .",
    "this , in particular , results in a projection of the trajectory in @xmath26 onto one in @xmath27 .",
    "of course , there is not just one way of specifying the coordinate systems in the two spacetimes , which leads to an ambiguity in the projected trajectory : different coordinate choices would , in general , give rise to different projected trajectories in @xmath27 , showing different accelerations and hence interpreted as being under the influence of different gravitational forces . this , of course , is nothing but an example of the usual gauge ambiguity intrinsic to perturbation theory in gr .",
    "the gravitational force , just like the metric perturbation itself , is _",
    "gauge dependent_.    it is straightforward to write down a gauge transformation law for @xmath33 . consider a small gauge displacement @xmath53 where the magnitude of @xmath54 is assumed to scale like that of the external perturbation @xmath55 .",

    "reproduces the geodesic deviation equation if one sets the left - hand side to zero and reinterprets @xmath61 as the displacement vector connecting two adjacent geodesics in @xmath27 .",
    "indeed , a vanishing @xmath62 implies that the two adjacent trajectories ( the original projected trajectory and its gauge - transformed counterpart ) have the same acceleration in @xmath27 , in which case the displacement vector between them is known to satisfy the geodesic deviation equation . ]      to devise a theory of the gravitational sf , one might be tempted to simply interpret it as an example of a gravitational force of the type discussed above , with the source of the metric perturbation now being the particle itself .",
    "this naive interpretation would be problematic , for several reasons .",
    "first , the physical perturbation due to the particle ( a retarded solution of the linearized einstein equations , @xmath63 ) is singular at the location of the particle , and the statement that the particle follows a geodesic of @xmath64 is therefore physically meaningless .",
    "obviously , trying to apply eq .",
    "( [ eq1:50 ] ) [ or ( [ eq1:80 ] ) ] with the external perturbation replaced with the self - perturbation @xmath63 would yield a singular , and hence meaningless result .",
    "second ( and relatedly ) , since we are now considering the self - gravity of the particle ( it is no longer a test particle ) , we must make a mathematical sense of its being `` pointlike '' .",
    "this is not a trivial matter to address in curved spacetime .",
    "mathematically , the usual delta - function representation of a point particle stress - energy is known to be inconsistent with the nonlinearity of the full einstein equations @xcite . a familiar physical manifestation of this is that one can not squeeze a finite amount of mass to a point without creating a black hole ( of a finite size ) .",
    "the mathematical consistency of a delta - function source is restored in the linear theory , but it remains a challenging task to understand how the notion of a point particle might emerge ( rather than be pre - assumed ) from a suitable limiting procedure .",
    "third , the sf is conceptually different from the external forces discussed above , in that the latter are , in truth , just fictitious forces resulting from our insistence to artificially split the physical spacetime into a background and a perturbation .",
    "the sf , in contrast , must be viewed as a genuine physical effect ( even if a delicate one , as the sf too is gauge dependent  see below ) .",
    "there indeed exists an interpretation of the motion  we will discuss it later  wherein the particle moves freely on a geodesic of a certain smooth , perturbed spacetime , subject to no sf .",
    "however , in this description the smooth geometry is _ not _ the physical spacetime of the background + particle system ( the metric of this geometry is not a retarded solution of the linearized einstein equations ) , and so this effective spacetime can not be said to represent `` physical reality '' any better than the sf itself .",
    "thanks to work commencing around 1997 and continuing to these days , we now have a rather satisfactory theory of the gravitational sf in curved spacetime , which , in particular , addresses all of the above issues .",
    "initial work was strongly inspired by the classical analyses of the analogous electromagnetic self - force problem in flat ( dirac , 1938 @xcite ) and curved ( dewitt and brehme , 1960 @xcite ) spacetimes .",
    "dewitt and brehme s work , especially , provided much of the mathematical framework  that of covariant bi - tensors in curved spacetime ",
    "needed for analyzing the gravitational problem too . in 1997",
    "two independent groups published three independent derivations of the gravitational sf .",
    "quinn and wald @xcite used an axiomatic approach , in which the physical self - acceleration is deduced , essentially , by comparing the ( divergent ) self - field of the particle in question with that of a particle in a suitably constructed tangent flat space . independently ,",
    "mino , sasaki and tanaka ( mst ) @xcite obtained the same result using a local energy - momentum conservation argument  a direct application of dewitt and brehme s method to the gravitational case .",
    "both these methods pre - assume a notion of a point mass particle , and neither seeks to make a consistent sense of this notion .",
    "however , mst s paper also reported a second , independent derivation of the sf , using an approach which , for the first time , offered a fully gr - consistent treatment of the problem .",
    "this approach  a new implementation of the old idea of _ matched asymptotic expansions_relies on the assumption that there can be identified two separate lengthscales in the problem : one associated with the particle s mass @xmath21 , and another , much larger , associated with the typical radius of curvature of the geometry in which the particle is moving . in the strong - field emri problem , the second lengthscale is provided by the mass of the central black hole , @xmath65 .",
    "mst s construction further assumes that the `` particle '' is actually a schwarzschild black hole of mass @xmath21 .",
    "the two separate scales in the setup define a `` near zone '' , @xmath66 , and a `` far zone '' , @xmath67 ( where @xmath68 is a suitable measure of distance from the small hole ) . in the near zone ,",
    "the geometry is approximately that of the small schwarzschild hole , with small tidal - type corrections from the background geometry .",
    "as we zoom away from the small object and enter the far zone , the effect of the small object s detailed structure becomes gradually less important , and at the far zone limit the geometry becomes that of the background spacetime , weakly perturbed by what is now a distant `` point particle''it is indeed the far - zone limit through which a notion of point mass can be defined in a consistent way . in situations",
    "where @xmath69 one would have a `` buffer zone '' where @xmath70 and both `` near zone '' and `` far zone '' descriptions of the geometry are valid .",
    "mst showed that matching the near zone and far zone metrics ( expressed as asymptotic expansions in @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively ) constrains the motion of the particle ( from a far - zone point of view ) and thus yields an expression for the sf .",
    "this expression agreed with those obtained by quinn and wald and by using dewitt and brehme s method ; it was later coined the _",
    "misataquwa formula _ , an acronym based on the names of the five contributing authors .",
    "a self - contained and pedagogical review of the misataquwa formula , including an elegant reproduction of previous derivations , can be found in poisson s @xcite .",
    "more recently , gralla and wald @xcite ( see also @xcite for a more concise presentation ) developed a new procedure for deriving the gravitational sf , which offers improved mathematical rigor as well as a generalization of the misataquwa formula . rather than relying on two separate asymptotic expansions of the metric as in mst s original method , gralla and wald introduce a single one - parameter family of metrics , which , through two different limiting procedures , can produce both near and far zone metrics in a natural way .",
    "this allows to define more robustly the criteria for existence of the two zones , and enables a more elegant buffer - zone matching .",
    "the analysis proves that in the far - zone limit the particle is described precisely by the usual delta - function distribution , and that at the very limit @xmath73 this particle moves on a geodesic of the background .",
    "furthermore , the analysis relaxes all assumptions about the nature of the small object : it no longer need to be a schwarzschild black hole , but can assume the form of any sufficiently small black hole or a blob of ordinary matter .",
    "this allows , in particular , for a spin - force term to appear in the resulting , generalized version of the misataquwa formula .",
    "the main end product of the above theoretical developments is a firmly - established general formula for the sf in a class of background spacetimes including kerr .",
    "it should be stressed that the sf formula stems in a deterministic way from nothing else than the einstein equations with the usual conservation laws ; it does not rely  and _ should _ not rely , as a matter of principle  on any form of ambiguous `` regularization '' or `` subtraction of infinities '' .",
    "this idea is implemented explicitly in the matched asymptotic expansions approach , and even more so in the gralla  wald analysis .",

    "instead , a meaningful description of the physical effect must involve both the sf and the gauge information associated with it ( in the form of the metric perturbation , for example ) .",
    "another crucial point to have in mind is that the misataquwa formula ( [ eq1:500 ] ) is guaranteed to hold true only if @xmath107 satisfies the lorenz - gauge condition ( [ eq1:140 ] ) . strictly speaking",

    "such possibilities are discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite .      given the sf ,",
    "the particle s equation of motion becomes @xmath108 where on the left - hand side we have the usual four - acceleration ( times @xmath21 ) along the background trajectory .",
    "this equation , along with the misataquwa equation ( [ eq1:500 ] ) , describe the dynamics of the particle given the metric perturbation ( and assuming one has a way of extracting the tail piece out of the full perturbation ) . to close the system of equations we need to know how the metric perturbation is determined from the particle s trajectory .",

    "however , as pointed out by garlla and wald recently @xcite , the field equation ( [ eq1:200 ] ) is only consistent with the lorenz gauge condition ( [ eq1:140 ] ) if the particle is moving strictly along a geodesic  which would then be inconsistent with the equation of motion ( [ eq1:190 ] ) . to resolve this inconsistency",
    "while allowing for orbital evolution , gralla and wald suggested a `` lorenz - gauge relaxation '' approach , wherein one relaxes the gauge condition ( [ eq1:140 ] ) and considers solutions of the set ( [ eq1:500],[eq1:190],[eq1:200 ] ) .",
    "one then expects that , in situations where the orbit is very nearly geodesic ( as is usually the case with lisa - relevant astrophysical inspirals ) , such solutions would give a faithful , albeit approximate description of the actual orbit .",
    "this approach is yet to implemented and tested in actual calculations of the orbital evolution .    the proposal to use self -",
    "consistent solutions of the set ( [ eq1:500 ] , [ eq1:190],[eq1:200 ] ) for modeling the slow orbital evolution at linear order in perturbation theory was put forward by gralla and wald in @xcite . a different mathematical framework , based on techniques from multi - scale perturbation theory , was developed by hinderer and flanagan in @xcite .",
    "pound and poisson @xcite performed first actual calculations of the orbital evolution under the full sf effect , using multi - scale analysis , within a weak - field , pn framework .",
    "thus far there are no calculations of the full orbital evolution in strong - field scenarios .    in the rest of this review we will not consider any further the question of orbital evolution , but rather focus on the calculation of the sf [ via eqs.([eq1:500 ] ) or ( [ eq1:600 ] ) ] along a pre - determined , non - evolving orbit .",
    "we consider this a preliminary step , whose output ( e.g. , the value of the sf at sufficiently many points across the relevant phase space ) can later be incorporated into whichever evolution scheme one chooses to apply .",
    "starting in the late 1990s , work began to translate misataquwa s sf formalism into practical working schemes and to implement it in actual calculations .",
    "while the `` holy grail '' of this program has from the outset been  and still remains  the calculation of the gravitational sf for generic orbits around kerr black holes , much of the initial effort has focused on the simpler toy problem of the scalar - field sf , and on simple classes of orbits ( radial , circular ) in schwarzschild spacetime .",

    "the same applies generically for all orbits in kerr , if the orbital integration is taken over sufficiently many periods ( formally , infinitely many ) .",

    "this allows us to write the legendre integral for @xmath674 in a factorized form : @xmath675 \\left[\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}d\\varphi'\\ , \\frac{p^{\\alpha}_{\\ ; abcd}w^{a}w^{b}w^{c}w^{d } } { ( p_{ab}w^a w^b)^{5/2}}\\right].\\ ] ] here the @xmath676 integral is elementary : the entire term in the first set of square brackets reads simply @xmath677 ( for any @xmath138 ) .",
    "the term in the second set of square brackets is @xmath678 , where @xmath227 are the ( @xmath138-independent ) integrals given in eq .",
    "( [ iabcd ] ) .",
    "these integrals , recall , are not elementary , but they can be expressed explicitly in terms of complete elliptic integrals , as in eq .",
    "( [ eqiabcd ] ) . in conclusion , we find @xmath679 importantly , the term @xmath674 contributes to each @xmath138-mode @xmath191 a _ constant amount _ , independent of @xmath138 .",
    "we have one more contribution to @xmath191 to consider : that of @xmath680 . recalling eq .",
    "( [ eqa:170 ] ) , we have @xmath681 where the integral is taken over the 2-sphere , we have used the jacobian @xmath682 , and the integrand is understood to be already evaluated at @xmath683 .",
    "the legendre polynomial can be written in the form @xmath684 , where @xmath685 admits a regular taylor expansion in @xmath686 .",
    "consider first the contribution of the term @xmath687 to @xmath680 : the corresponding integrand in eq .",
    "( [ eqa:280 ] ) has the form @xmath688 ( recalling @xmath689 ) , where @xmath690 is a polynomial of homogeneous order 3 in @xmath691 .",
    "this contribution to the integrand is therefore bounded , and we are allowed to swap the limit and integral just as we did with @xmath692 .",
    "the resulting integral then vanishes by virtue of the same symmetry argument applied in the case of @xmath692 : both functions @xmath693 and @xmath685 are even in each of @xmath78 and @xmath620 , while all the possible terms in @xmath694 are odd in either @xmath78 or @xmath620 .",
    "we are thus left with the contribution @xmath695 to evaluate this integral , we divide the integration domain ( the 2-sphere ) into two regions : let @xmath696 denote the square @xmath697 for some particular @xmath698 ( say , @xmath699 ) ; and let @xmath700 denote the remaining integration area .",
    "consider first the contribution to @xmath680 from @xmath700 : since in this domain the integrand is regular ( the only singularity is at @xmath611 , which is in @xmath696 ) , we are allowed to interchange the limit and integration . as a result , the integrand takes the form @xmath701 , and the integral over @xmath700 vanishes by virtue of the odd symmetry .",
    "the remaining piece of the integral , over @xmath696 , is @xmath702 this integral takes a simpler form if we express it in terms of the rescaled coordinates @xmath703 , @xmath704 , and @xmath705 ( where we have already taken @xmath668 ) . for given @xmath706",
    "we have @xmath707 , where the sign corresponds to the sign of @xmath708 .",
    "hence we obtain @xmath709 where the last equality holds because the integrand , expressed in terms of the tilde variables , no longer depends on @xmath708 .",
    "this integral is now elementary , and evaluating it gives @xmath710 where the signs correspond to @xmath711 , and where the various boyer - lindquist components of @xmath206 are given in eq .",
    "( [ a ] ) . [ section v.d of ref .",
    "@xcite explains in detail how the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eqa:297 ] ) is evaluated in the special case of schwarzschild , and the method is directly applicable to kerr . ]",
    "notice that @xmath680 is found to depend on @xmath138 only through the prefactor @xmath213 .    in summary",
    ", collecting the results ( [ eqa:160 ] ) , ( [ eqa:240 ] ) , ( [ eqa:270 ] ) and ( [ eqa:300 ] ) , we find that the @xmath138 modes @xmath191 are given _",
    "precisely _ by @xmath712 where @xmath206 and @xmath713 are @xmath138-independent . comparing with eq .",
    "( [ eqa:10 ] ) , we identify @xmath206 and @xmath207 as the first two of the regularization parameters .",
    "this comparison also implies @xmath714 .",
    "furthermore , we find that each of the individual terms in the sum over @xmath138 in eq .",
    "( [ eqa:20 ] ) vanishes , giving also @xmath715 .",
    "this completes the derivation of all regularization parameters .",
    "we comment on a potentially confusing aspect of the above analysis : we have discarded in eq .",
    "( [ eqa:160 ] ) the @xmath398 terms of @xmath716 , which vanish at @xmath98 .",
    "clearly , the multipole expansion of these neglected terms could contribute to @xmath646 [ e.g. , they may well add a term @xmath717 in eq .",
    "( [ eqa:310 ] ) ] .",
    "such terms , however , must add up to zero upon summation over @xmath138 ( when evaluated at the particle ) .",

    "<S> this review is concerned with the gravitational self - force acting on a mass particle in orbit around a large black hole . renewed interest in this old problem is driven by the prospects of detecting gravitational waves from strongly gravitating binaries with extreme mass ratios . </S>",
    "<S> we begin here with a summary of recent advances in the theory of gravitational self - interaction in curved spacetime , and proceed to survey some of the ideas and computational strategies devised for implementing this theory in the case of a particle orbiting a kerr black hole . </S>",
    "<S> we review in detail two of these methods : ( i ) the standard _ mode - sum method _ , in which the metric perturbation is regularized mode - by - mode in a multipole decomposition , and ( ii ) _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0-mode regularization _ , whereby individual azimuthal modes of the metric perturbation are regularized in 2 + 1 dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss several practical issues that arise , including the choice of gauge , the numerical representation of the particle singularity , and how high - frequency contributions near the particle are dealt with in frequency - domain calculations . as an example of a full end - to - end implementation of the mode - sum method </S>",
    "<S> , we discuss the computation of the gravitational self - force for eccentric geodesic orbits in schwarzschild , using a direct integration of the lorenz - gauge perturbation equations in the time domain . with the computational framework now in place , </S>",
    "<S> researchers have recently turned to explore the physical consequences of the gravitational self force ; we will describe some preliminary results in this area . </S>",
    "<S> an appendix to this review presents , for the first time , a detailed derivation of the `` regularization parameters '' necessary for implementing the mode - sum method in kerr spacetime . </S>"
