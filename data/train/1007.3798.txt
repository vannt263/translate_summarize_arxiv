    "understanding the steady state of a system in contact with two heat baths at unequal temperatures is a central question to the theory of non - equilibrium systems@xcite .",
    "with very few exceptions ( such as zero range processes@xcite ) , non equilibrium systems exhibit long range correlations in their steady state@xcite .",
    "these correlations have been studied theoretically by various approaches and measured experimentally .    for a one dimensional diffusive system of size @xmath0 , for instance a stochastic lattice gas ,",
    "these long range correlations take the following scaling form@xcite : @xmath1 ( where @xmath2 is an observable at position @xmath3 such as the density or the energy ) when the distances between the positions @xmath4 are macroscopic ( i.e. @xmath5 ) .    the macroscopic fluctuation theory developed by bertini",
    "et al.@xcite allows one to write down the general equations satisfied by the scaling functions @xmath6@xcite .",
    "these partial differential equations are usually difficult to solve . the expressions of the @xmath6 are however known in a number of examples@xcite , where they have been obtained either from exact solutions of microscopic models or by integrating the partial differential equations derived from the macroscopic fluctuation theory .",
    "diffusive systems are also known to satisfy fourier s law , meaning that , for large system sizes , the steady state flux @xmath7 of energy through a system of size @xmath0 scales like @xmath8 : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a function of the temperatures @xmath11 and @xmath12 of the heat baths at the two extremities of the system , which maintain it out of equilibrium ; the function @xmath13 vanishes linearly with the difference @xmath14 so that the flux becomes a gradient .    over the last 15 years@xcite it has been realized on the basis of numerical simulations that one - dimensional mechanical systems which conserve momentum do not satisfy fourier s law",
    "instead , they exhibit a power law decay , called anomalous fourier s law , of the average flux @xmath15 with system size : @xmath16 so far , the exponent @xmath17 has not been determined analytically for any microscopic model with non - quadratic interactions ; however , numerical@xcite and analytic@xcite calculations , based on mode coupling theory or on other approaches@xcite , indicate that , depending on the type of the non - linearities and on the accuracy of the simulations , @xmath17 can take values ranging between @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the main two systems for which this anomalous heat conduction has been observed are :    * the fermi - pasta - ulam model , a chain of @xmath20 harmonic oscillators with an additional cubic ( fpu-@xmath17 ) or quartic ( fpu-@xmath21 ) interaction potential@xcite . for the latter case ,",
    "most estimates indicate that @xmath22 ; * a one - dimensional gas of @xmath20 hard point particles with elastic collisions@xcite ( when the particles are identical , the collisions simply exchange the velocities of the incoming particles : hence the system has the same transport properties as an ideal gas , i.e. a ballistic transport with @xmath23 ) . for the collisions to be non - trivial ,",
    "one choice is to consider particles of alternating masses 1 and @xmath24 ( 2-mass model ) . in this case",
    ", it is commonly found that @xmath25@xcite .    in comparison with diffusive systems , for which ( [ fourier ] ) holds",
    ", the main feature of these models is that their dynamics conserve momentum , and it is believed that this property plays a key role in the divergence of the heat conductivity@xcite .",
    "note , however , that there is no proof for this behavior : the argument of @xcite is not correct , although its conclusion is consistent with observations .    in this article",
    ", we consider a simpler model originally introduced in @xcite , the velocity reversal model , in order to better understand which features could be at the origin of the anomaly .",
    "this model is , like the 1d hard - particle gas , a system of @xmath20 free - moving particles undergoing collisions .",
    "the collisions are , however , not elastic , but instead are given by the following simple rule :    * when two particles collide with velocities of opposite signs , @xmath26 , their two velocities get reversed ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 at the collision ) ; * when they collide with velocities of the same sign , the particles simply pass each other ( @xmath29 and @xmath30 if the particles are kept ordered from left to right ) .",
    "in contrast with the fermi - pasta - ulam chain and the hard - particle gas , these dynamics do not conserve momentum .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the absolute values of the velocities themselves are conserved , leading in general to more conserved quantities than in standard momentum - conserving models .",
    "one should also note that , when the velocities are reversed at independent exponential times instead of at collisions , the system becomes diffusive@xcite .    here , the @xmath20 particles of the velocity reversal model are in a one - dimensional box of length @xmath31 between two boundaries which play the role of heat baths . whenever a particle hits a boundary , its velocity is changed as if the particle was reinjected instantaneously , with its velocity thermalized by the reservoir .",
    "the reservoirs are thus described by the velocity p.d.f . of these `` reinjected particles '' , @xmath32 and @xmath33 . an obvious choice is to consider maxwellian reservoirs at temperatures @xmath11 and @xmath12 , with velocity densities @xmath34 we will study below this `` maxwellian case '' for @xmath35 and @xmath36 . for a system which thermalizes well",
    ", one would expect other choices of these reservoir velocity densities to only affect small regions near the boundaries , but not to influence the macroscopic behavior of the system .",
    "for the velocity reversal model , however , the conservation of the absolute values of the particle velocities prevents thermalization from taking place : for instance , one can easily see that , for another choice of reservoirs , where particles are always reinjected with velocities @xmath37 from the left reservoir and @xmath38 for the right reservoir , @xmath39 the only possible velocities inside the system are @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "we will study this `` two - speed case '' with @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "in a first part , we show , by studying the steady - state current of systems with @xmath44 particles , that , both in the maxwellian and the two - speed case , the velocity - reversal model exhibits anomalous fourier s law , in contrast to the prediction of the associated boltzmann equation@xcite",
    ".    we then present , in a second part , measurements of the steady - state correlation functions of the momentum density for maxwellian and two - speed systems of @xmath45 particles , as well as for a 2-mass hard - particle gas with @xmath46 and @xmath47 for comparison : they indicate a size dependence very different from ( [ diff_corr ] ) .",
    "the main advantage of the velocity reversal model described above , compared to the hard - particle gas for instance , is that its associated boltzmann equation can be solved analytically , thanks to the simpler form of its collision term . by solving this boltzmann equation in the steady state with the appropriate boundary conditions ,",
    "the average current between the reservoirs can be predicted , as done in @xcite .",
    "the simplest case is the two - speed system ( [ 2vitesses ] ) with velocities @xmath37 and @xmath38 , for which the boltzmann equation relates the four densities @xmath48 and @xmath49 of the particles with respective velocities @xmath40 and @xmath41 , with @xmath50 the space coordinate :    @xmath51     for the velocity - reversal model with @xmath52 particles , in the maxwellian case with @xmath53 and @xmath36 ( above ) and in the two - speed case with @xmath42 and @xmath43 ( below ) . in both cases , the current decreases as a non - integer power of the system size : over the range of sizes we considered , our data are well - fitted by @xmath54 in the maxwellian case and @xmath55 in the two - speed case . ]     and @xmath43 and for system sizes @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 ( continuous lines ) . according to the boltzmann equation",
    ", these profiles ( given by @xmath59 and @xmath60 respectively ) should be linear in @xmath61.,title=\"fig : \" ]   and @xmath43 and for system sizes @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 ( continuous lines ) . according to the boltzmann equation",
    ", these profiles ( given by @xmath59 and @xmath60 respectively ) should be linear in @xmath61.,title=\"fig : \" ]     + setting the time derivatives to @xmath62 , these equations can be solved@xcite to determine the steady state of the two - speed system : @xmath63 yielding linear profiles for the four densities as well as a steady - state current @xmath64 satisfying fourier s law([fourier ] ) . by a similar calculation",
    ", the boltzmann equation also predicts that the energy current should also satisfy fourier s law in the maxwellian case .",
    "we studied numerically the maxwellian ( [ gaussien ] ) and the two - speed ( [ 2vitesses ] ) velocity reversal models for @xmath44 particles , with @xmath35 , @xmath36 in the first case and @xmath42 , @xmath43 in the second .",
    "because the true steady state is unknown , our measurements were performed by starting the system in an equilibrium configuration at @xmath65 in the maxwellian case , and by choosing the particle velocities uniformly at random among @xmath40 , @xmath41 in the two - speed case .",
    "we then let the system evolve from that initial state , and sampled the time evolution of @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 : @xmath66 was measured by a time average of the instantaneous energy flux , @xmath69 , while @xmath67 and @xmath68 were measured by counting the particles and energy within the boxes @xmath70 for @xmath71 .",
    "we then took the long - time limits of these measured quantities to estimate their values in the steady state .",
    "as shown in figure [ joel_cur ] , our data indicate that @xmath66 decreases like a power law of @xmath20 for both choices of reservoirs for the system sizes we considered .",
    "they are consistent with ( [ anomalous ] ) , with @xmath72 for the maxwellian reservoirs and @xmath73 for the two - speed reservoirs . in the latter case , the density and energy profiles @xmath67 and @xmath68 shown in figure [ 2v_prof ] also differ noticeably from the linear profiles predicted by the boltzmann approach , at least for the sizes we were able to study .",
    "the main assumption in the derivation of the boltzmann equation is that there are no correlations between the velocities of particles entering a collision in which their velocities are reversed . as it fails to predict the anomalous fourier s law of figure [ joel_cur ]",
    ", it is interesting to investigate the form of the steady - state correlations for the velocity reversal model .",
    "we measured numerically the steady - state two - point correlation functions of the momentum field , @xmath74 , for the velocity reversal model in the maxwellian ( fig .",
    "[ g_cv ] ) and in the two - speed ( fig .",
    "[ 2v_cv ] ) cases , for systems of @xmath75 to @xmath76 particles .    as in the previous section , we approximated the momentum density function @xmath77 by its discretization over the boxes @xmath78 for @xmath79 .",
    "we took the stationary - state correlations @xmath74 , which we measured for @xmath80 and @xmath81 , to be the long - time limits of their time evolutions for a system started in the arbitrary initial state described in the previous section .     of the momentum field @xmath77 for the velocity reversal model in the maxwellian case ( [ gaussien ] ) with @xmath53 and @xmath82 , for @xmath80 ( left ) and @xmath81 ( right).,title=\"fig : \" ]   of the momentum field @xmath77 for the velocity reversal model in the maxwellian case ( [ gaussien ] ) with @xmath53 and @xmath82 , for @xmath80 ( left ) and @xmath81 ( right).,title=\"fig : \" ]     of the momentum field @xmath77 for the velocity reversal model in the two - speed case ( [ 2vitesses ] ) with @xmath83 and @xmath43 , for @xmath80 ( left ) and @xmath81 ( right).,title=\"fig : \" ]   of the momentum field @xmath77 for the velocity reversal model in the two - speed case ( [ 2vitesses ] ) with @xmath83 and @xmath43 , for @xmath80 ( left ) and @xmath81 ( right).,title=\"fig : \" ]    for diffusive systems , one would expect @xmath74 to follow a scaling of the form ( [ diff_corr ] ) : @xmath84 , except for @xmath85 with a variance @xmath86 of order 1 . for the velocity reversal models of figures [ g_cv ] and [ 2v_cv ] , we observed @xmath87 to be of order @xmath88 : however , when measuring @xmath74 for @xmath89 and @xmath90 , as in figures [ g_cv ] and [ 2v_cv ] ) , we observed an additional anomalous gowth in @xmath74 for @xmath61 close to @xmath91 in a region growing with system size , but becoming narrower on a macroscopic scale .",
    "the sign of @xmath74 seems to be always negative for @xmath91 closer to the left ( warmer ) reservoir and positive for @xmath91 closer to the right , colder reservoir .",
    "as shown in figures [ g_cv ] and [ 2v_cv ] , where our data are multiplied by the system size @xmath20 , the correlations seem to decay slower than @xmath92 as @xmath20 grows , over a region which seems to grow slower than the system size .    in order to compare the behavior of these models with those of usual momentum - conserving models",
    ", we also measured the two - point correlation function of the momentum for a hard - particle gas of particles of alternating masses @xmath88 and @xmath93 between maxwellian reservoirs at @xmath35 and @xmath94 : we observed a similar growth of the correlation functions at intermediate scales ( fig .",
    "[ 2m_cv ] ) .    for this hard - particle gas ( fig .",
    "[ 2m_cv ] ) , due to a faster relaxation to the steady state , we were able to simulate much larger system sizes than for the velocity reversal model : at these sizes , @xmath95 , the anomalous growth of @xmath96 of figure [ 2v_cv ] is compatible with a scaling of the form @xmath97 as shown in figure [ scaling ] .",
