    "one of the main problems in boundary integrable field theories is to find boundary conditions that preserve the integrability of a given bulk integrable field theory , that is , integrable boundary conditions .",
    "this has been carried out for several models by direct inspection of higher - spin conserved charges @xcite . in @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite ) it has been shown that models with @xmath1 or @xmath3 symmetry admit a family of @xmath4 integrable boundary conditions , which are obtained by requiring @xmath5 field components to satisfy neumann and the remaining @xmath6 to satisfy dirichlet , @xmath7 .",
    "these conditions are of diagonal type , which means that scattering off the boundary will not change the flavor of the incoming particle",
    ". we will refer to this type of boundary scattering problem as the diagonal case .",
    "a natural question one would ask then is if there are more integrable boundary conditions for these models with @xmath1 symmetry , or if the diagonal case exhaust all possibilities .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study the possible integrable boundary conditions for models with @xmath1 global symmetry .",
    "we find nondiagonal integrable boundary conditions for the @xmath1 nonlinear @xmath2 ( nl@xmath2 ) model .",
    "these are genuinely nondiagonal boundary conditions in the sense that they can not be put into diagonal form by a redefinition ( global rotation ) of the fields .",
    "these conclusions should carry out to other models , like the @xmath3 gross - neveu and principal chiral models .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we review some of the generalities of boundary integrable field theories which are relevant for our discussion .",
    "we also review the goldschmidt - witten argument , and use it to establish the integrability of the @xmath1 nonlinear @xmath2 model . in section 3",
    "we look at a very simple example , to illustrate some of the issues that are relevant in our analysis . in section 4",
    "we introduce the new integrable boundary conditions for the nonlinear @xmath2 model , which are the main concern of this paper . in section 5",
    "we compute the nondiagonal reflection matrices associated to these boundary conditions by solving the boundary yang - baxter equation , in particular we look at the @xmath8 case , and present a solution for the @xmath9 case to which we do not know what are the corresponding boundary conditions .",
    "finally in section 6 we present our conclusions and some possible directions for further work .",
    "let us consider a bulk integrable field theory defined by an action s= _",
    "-^+ dx_1 _ -^+ dx_0 _ b ( , ) , where @xmath10 is the bulk lagrangian , which depends locally on the field @xmath11 and its partial derivatives . is symbolic and may denote a collection of fields , bosonic or fermionic fields and so on .",
    "] we say that it may be defined by a local action because there are several bulk integrable models that are not , such as perturbed conformal field theories .",
    "as is well known , in two - dimensions integrability has several important consequences : in a multi - particle scattering process there is no particle production and the set on in and out momenta is the same , the @xmath12-matrix factorizes into a product of two - body @xmath12-matrices , and the two - body @xmath12-matrix satisfies the yang - baxter equation , besides the usual requirements of unitarity and crossing - symmetry .",
    "these conditions , together with the knowledge of the symmetries of the @xmath12-matrix , often allow one to determine the two - body @xmath12-matrix exactly , up to cdd factors .",
    "when we consider this theory on the half - line , the introduction of a boundary may easily break the conservation of bulk charges , as it is seen in the simple case of linear momentum .",
    "therefore we are not assured that the resulting model will be integrable , and we must specify boundary conditions .",
    "these boundary conditions correspond to boundary dynamics , which may be described by some local lagrangian .",
    "the boundary version of a given bulk model is defined by the action s=_-^0 dx_1",
    "_ -^+ dx_0 _ b ( , ) + _",
    "-^+ dx_0 _ b(.|_x=0 , .",
    "|_x=0 ) , where @xmath13 is the boundary action , depending only on the values of the field @xmath11 and its time derivatives , at @xmath14 .",
    "the boundary lagrangian defines the boundary dynamics , and it s easy to see that it induces boundary conditions through equations of motion .",
    "for example , for a scalar boson we have _ 1     in order to have a boundary integrable model , we have to pick a suitable boundary action such that a combination of bulk conserved charges is still conserved .",
    "in order to discuss boundary conserved charges , we briefly review the bulk case .    a local ( bulk )",
    "conservation law of spin @xmath15 is written as _",
    "-j_+^(s+1)=_+ r_-^(s-1 ) _ + j_-^(s+1)=_- r_+^(s-1 )  , and from these equations , one easily establishes the conservation of the following charges q_+=_-^+ dx_1 ( j_+^(s+1)- r_-^(s-1 ) ) q_-=_-^+ dx_1 ( j_-^(s+1)- r_+^(s-1 ) ) in proving that these charges are conserved we have to use the fact that we can discard surface terms .",
    "when we restrict our model to the half - line we can not do that with the surface term at @xmath14 . on the other hand , if the following condition @xcite is satisfied j_-^(s+1 ) -j_+^(s+1 ) + r_-^(s-1 ) -r_+^(s-1 ) = ( t ) [ condition ] where @xmath16 is a _ local _ field , then = _",

    "for example , in light - cone coordinates the energy - momentum charges are @xmath17 , but after the introduction of a boundary only @xmath18 is conserved , with @xmath19 .",
    "we should look for the possible boundary conditions that we can impose to a given model such that [ condition ] holds .",
    "once this is done one should look for solutions of the boundary yang - baxter equation ( bybe ) which can be related to the proposed boundary conditions .",
    "we describe the bybe in the next subsection      boundary integrability is encoded in the boundary yang - baxter equation ( bybe ) in a similar way as bulk integrability is encoded in the yang - baxter equation ( ybe ) .",
    "we should stress that , unlike the bulk case , we do not know what is the symmetry group at the boundary a priori . in the bulk case",
    "the knowledge of the bulk global symmetries greatly simplify the form of the @xmath12-matrix .",
    "unfortunately we do not have a similar set up for the boundary case , and therefore the analysis of the possible structure of the reflection matrix will have to rely on general physical arguments .",
    "recently this issue has been addressed in @xcite for the case of the nonlinear schroedinger model .",

    "one aspect that may look puzzling is the fact that , at this point , we have two constants to be fixed , @xmath115 and @xmath132 , but only one coupling constant @xmath0 .    in order to find a further constraint involving @xmath115 and @xmath132 , consider the scattering process @xmath133 after dividing by @xmath134 , we plug the solutions [ xy ] into [ cc ] to obtain , after an elementary but tedious calculation , that c+c=-i [ c+c ] we have checked that the expressions [ xy ] together with [ c+c ] solve all the remaining bybe s .",
    "there are two ways to get diagonal reflection matrices from [ xy ] and the constraint [ c+c ] .",
    "the first one is by setting @xmath131 , and we obtain the result for the diagonal case with @xmath135 fields satisfying neumann boudary condition and the remaining @xmath136 dirichlet @xcite .",
    "this is the deciding factor that made us choose dirichlet boundary conditions for the diagonally - scattering fields in section 4 .",
    "the other way to have diagonal reflection matrices is by having both @xmath115 and @xmath132 go to @xmath137 . in this case",
    "we have @xmath109 and we conclude that all field components satisfy the same boundary condition , that is , dirichlet .    therefore if we write @xmath138 and @xmath139 , where @xmath140 is a ( unknown ) function of the boundary coupling constant , we have that , for @xmath141 ( @xmath135 neumann , @xmath136 dirichlet ) we should have @xmath142 ( and so @xmath143 ) , and for @xmath144 ( all dirichlet ) , @xmath109 and so @xmath145 . we see , then , that there are integrable flows between diagonal reflection matrices , and that the reflection matrices we found have the correct behaviour , as compared to the one dictated by the microscopic boundary lagrangian .",
    "all that is left to do now is to solve the boundary unitarity and boundary crossing - symmetry conditions , which will be dealt with shortly .",
    "based on the `` very simple example '' studied before and the solution we found for the case of 2 nondiagonal fields , we are tempted at constructing other solutions of the bybe in a similar fashion as the one just done . as we will see now , there are no such solutions .",
    "consider the following ansatz for the @xmath146 model r()= (    ccccc a ( ) & b ( ) & 0 & 0 & 0 + -b ( ) & a ( ) & 0 & 0 & 0 + 0 & 0 & a ( ) & b ( ) & 0 + 0 & 0 & -b ( ) & a ( ) & 0 + 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & r_0 ( )    )  ,  [ 4fields ] this reflection matrix should correspond to the following boundary action s_b=_-^+ dx_0 ( n_1-n_2 + n_3-n_4 ) in principle we could have two different coupling constants , one for the fields @xmath147 and @xmath148 and another for @xmath96 and @xmath149 , but we are choosing them to be equal in order to simplify the argument .",
    "since this case is a special point of the general case , the absence of solutions in this case will establish our claim that there are no solutions with more than 2 nondiagonal fields .",
    "we will look at the @xmath146 case , but the argument is the same for @xmath1 with more than on nondiagonal block .",
    "the bybe for the processes @xmath150 and @xmath151 and @xmath152 have the same form as the ones given in [ xy ] . if we consider now the bybe for the process latexmath:[$|a_5(\\theta_1)a_5(\\theta_2)\\rangle",
    "\\rightarrow    besides the diagonal one ( @xmath131 ) for the constants @xmath115 and @xmath132 , and therefore there is no solution of the bybe consistent with [ 4fields ] .",
    "before we proceed , we should mention another solution of the bybe for even @xmath36 , but to which we do not know how to assign microscopic boundary conditions .",
    "let us consider the following block - diagonal ansatz for the reflection matrix r()= (    ccccc a ( ) & b ( ) & 0 & 0 & + -b ( ) &",
    "a ( ) & 0 & 0 & + 0 & 0 & a ( ) & b ( ) & + 0 & 0 & -b ( ) & a ( ) & + & & & &    )  ,   the bybe for the process @xmath154 , and taking the limit @xmath155 , we get ( ) = ( )  , whose solution is =  , where @xmath156 is a constant .",
    "we have checked that this alone solves all the remaining bybe s , and therefore @xmath156 is left as a free - parameter .",
    "all we need to do is to fix @xmath157 using unitarity and boundary crossing symmetry . since their solution is quite straightforward , we will not quote it here . the only diagonal reflection matrix that can be obtained from this solution",
    "is by taking @xmath158 , which corresponds to all components satisfying neumann boundary conditions .",
    "if @xmath159 we have a block diagonal solution , each block being antisymmetric .",
    "note that one must be careful in taking @xmath160 , since unitarity and crossing symmetry will give a prefactor with an overall dependence on @xmath156 , which precisely cancels the @xmath156 dependence of @xmath161 in this limit .      in the limit",
    "@xmath162 we can solve the bybe completely . in this subsection",
    "we will not write down the bybe s explicitly , since they can be derived quite easily , and the @xmath8 case is not our main interest .",
    "we will describe which equations one needs to solve to fix the structure of the reflection matrix completely , in any case .",
    "initially consider the general form for the reflection matrix r()= (    cc f ( ) & w ( ) + h ( ) & g ( )    )  .",
    "the bybe for @xmath163 gives h(_1)w(_2)=h(_2)w(_1 )  .",
    "[ hw ] if these amplitudes are non - zero , we have to have w()=h ( )  , where @xmath156 is a constant .",
    "next , the bybe for @xmath164 requires ( ) = ( ( ) ^2 - 1 ) whose solution is = for some constant @xmath165 . finally , the bybe for @xmath166 demands g()=h ( )  .",
    "the reflection matrix is , then , r()=h ( ) (    cc & + 1 &    )  .",
    "[ r_o2 ] to obtain the solution where we would have set @xmath167 ( or equivalently @xmath168 ) in [ hw ] , all we should do is to set @xmath158 in [ r_o2 ] .",
    "we have checked that [ r_o2 ] solves all the remaining bybe s .",
    "the function @xmath169 may be fixed by unitarity and boundary crossing - unitarity , but again , we are not going to carry out this computation here .",
    "one aspect that may look puzzling is the fact that we know that the @xmath8 model is related to the sine - gordon model , and [ r_o2 ] has 3 independent parameters , unlike the boundary sine - gordon model , where one has only 2 independent parameters .",
    "the reason for that is that we are not looking at the sg model at arbitrary coupling constant , but at @xmath55 , and as pointed out in @xcite , at special points for the coupling constant ( like this one ) there are more solutions than the ones presented there for arbitrary @xmath165 .",
    "we now go back to the solution of unitarity and boundary - crossing symmetry conditions for the reflection matrix [ r_matrix ] .",
    "the next two subsections refer to this reflection matrix .",
    "the boundary - unitarity condition implies that r_0()r_0(-)=1  , [ u1 ] and a()a(-)-b()b(-)=1 a(-)b()+a()b(-)=0  .",
    "[ u2 ] by dividing [ u2 ] by @xmath170 , and using the explicit forms [ xy ] , we see that [ u2 ] is satisfied trivially .",
    "therefore , all we have to solve from unitarity is [ u1 ] .",
    "the boundary - crossing unitarity condition for the diagonal part of the reflection matrix is r_0(-)=((n-2)_1(2)+_2(2)+ _",
    "3(2))r_0(+)+ 2_1(2)a(+ ) [ bcu ]  . using [ xy ] and [ c+c ] ,",
    "we can rewrite [ bcu ] as r_0(-)=r_0(+)(_i(2 ) + 2_1(2)(x(+)-1 ) ) [ bcu2 ]  .",
    "all the other boundary - crossing unitarity equations are equivalent to this one.using the parametreization for @xmath115 and @xmath132 introduced after equation [ c+c ] , and after some elementary , but tedious , computation , we can cast [ bcu2 ] into a quite compact form r_0(-)=r_0(+)_i(2 ) [ bcu3 ] finally we can fix @xmath171 by solving [ bcu3 ] and [ u1 ] & & r_0()= - + & & k ( ) where @xmath172 is the solution of [ bcu3 ] and [ u1 ] without the @xmath173-dependent factors @xcite ,",
    "k()= - this fixes the reflection matrix completely .",
    "this solution for the reflection matrix reduces to the appropriate diagonal solutions in the limits @xmath174 ( @xmath135 neumann , @xmath136 dirichlet ) and @xmath175 ( all dirichlet ) .",
    "it would be interesting to study the analytical structure of this reflection amplitude , but this requires the knowledge of the explicit form of the function @xmath140 .",
    "we have found new integrable boundary conditions for the @xmath1 model which are nondiagonal and depend on one free parameter .",
    "the integrable boundary conditions presented here break the @xmath1 symmetry to @xmath89 .",
    "a similar conclusion has been reached for the @xmath176 spin chain in @xcite .",
    "these boundary conditions , together with the diagonal ones proposed in @xcite , are argued to exhaust the possible integrable boundary conditions for the @xmath1 model .",
    "we also found solutions of the bybe which depend on one parameter and that can be associated to these boundary conditions , and saw that they do satisfy the appropriate limits , which correspond to the coupling constant @xmath177 or @xmath137 .",
    "we found the most general solution of the bybe for the @xmath8 model , which is described by a three - parameter family , unlike the well - known two - parameter solution of the boundary sine - gordon .",
    "this is understood by noting that the @xmath8 model corresponds to the @xmath55 sine - gordon model , and as pointed out in@xcite , at this point , and in general for points where @xmath178 , there are additional solutions .    in section 4",
    "we established the integrability of the nondiagonal boundary conditions , by inspecting the spin-@xmath179 charges proposed in @xcite .",
    "there were no constraints on how many nondiagonal blocks one can have , whereas we found that there are solutions of the bybe only in the case of one single nondiagonal block .",
    "one possible explanation for that is that by inspecting higher spin charges there would be further constraints on the possible boundary conditions , but this is still to be checked .",
    "recently , mackay and short @xcite have studied the principal chiral model with a boundary and found an interesting relationship between their boundary conditions and the theory of symmetric spaces .",
    "their solutions , though , are quite different from ours , and some work should be done in trying to clarify their relationship .",
    "there are several directions to be pursued now .",
    "the @xmath12-matrix for the elementary excitations in the @xmath3 principal chiral and @xmath1 gross - neveu models , are , up to cdd factors , the same as the one for the @xmath1 model , and therefore the bybe s for all the three models is the same .",
    "this means that it should be possible to find microscopic lagrangians which provide nondiagonal boundary conditions for these other models , similar to the ones presented here , also depending on one free parameter .",
    "another problem that arises naturally is to find the exact form of the function @xmath140 , which is , in general quite hard ( as for example , in the case of the boundary sine - gordon model ) .",
    "a related problem is to perform a large-@xmath36 expansion for the reflection matrices ( diagonal and nondiagonal ) as a check of their validity .",
    "unfortunately a framework of how to perform boundary perturbation theory is yet to be developed .",
    "finally , the study of the thermodynamics of the boundary model would be an interesting , if somewhat challenging , problem .",
