    "<S> th/99204 + july 1999    = 14.5pt    experimental measurements of the forward  backward and left  right forward  backward asymmetries in @xmath0 annihilation to fermions provide some of the best determinations of the weak mixing angle @xmath1@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the forward  backward asymmetry of @xmath2 quarks is measured with a precision of about 2% , allowing an extraction of @xmath1 with almost per mille accuracy . however , since we are dealing with quarks in the final state , we must ensure that qcd corrections , both perturbative and non - perturbative , are understood to at least the same precision . </S>",
    "<S> for the perturbative corrections , this requires working to at least next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) .    to date </S>",
    "<S> there have been two @xmath3 calculations , both in the massless approximation and using a slightly different definition of the asymmetry than the experimental measurements , which use the thrust axis rather than the quark direction . </S>",
    "<S> the classic calculation of altarelli and lampe@xcite determined the @xmath3 coefficient numerically and found it to be small . </S>",
    "<S> this result has been the basis of all the experimental analyses since . however , the recent analytical calculation by ravindran and van neerven@xcite obtained a coefficient about four times bigger . </S>",
    "<S> this discrepancy is comparable to the size of the experimental errors and needs to be resolved before the final electroweak fits to the lep1 data can be made . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath3-calculation using the experimentally - used thrust axis definition , would also be highly desirable .    </S>",
    "<S> we have recently performed a numerical calculation of the @xmath3 corrections to the forward  </S>",
    "<S> backward asymmetry@xcite . anticipating the result , given below </S>",
    "<S> , we can say that to the precision required by experiment we confirm the result of ravindran and van neerven and therefore rule out the result of altarelli and lampe . </S>",
    "<S> however , we do have a theoretically - important difference compared to ravindran and van neerven , in that we find that the forward  </S>",
    "<S> backward asymmetry contains terms enhanced by logarithms of the quark mass . </S>",
    "<S> even though these terms are numerically tiny for realistic quark masses , as a point of principle it means that the forward  </S>",
    "<S> backward asymmetry of massless quarks is not perturbatively calculable and non - perturbative fragmentation functions have to be introduced .    </S>",
    "<S> we also calculated for the first time the corrections using the thrust axis definition rather than the quark direction . </S>",
    "<S> these lie approximately midway between the results of refs.@xcite and@xcite for the quark axis definition .    </S>",
    "<S> we here only briefly sketch the method and give the final result , and refer the reader to ref.@xcite for more details .    the simplest definition of the @xmath2-quark - quark . </S>",
    "<S> the results for the charm quark can be simply obtained by properly replacing the mass and couplings of the massive quark . ] forward  backward asymmetry @xmath4 is @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the number of @xmath2 quarks observed in the forward and backward hemispheres , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> the axis that identifies the forward direction can be defined in a variety of ways . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we explicitly consider two different definitions : the @xmath2-quark direction , and the thrust axis direction , which we denote by @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively .    according to the definition in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ afbdef ] ) , @xmath4 can be expressed in an equivalent way in terms of the cross section @xmath10 for inclusive @xmath2-quark production , where @xmath11 is the fraction of the electron energy carried by the @xmath2 quark and @xmath12 is the angle between the electron momentum and the direction defining the forward hemisphere ( both energies and angles are defined in the centre - of - mass frame ) .    starting from the distribution in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ dcs ] ) , we can introduce the forward and backward cross sections @xmath13 and @xmath14 : @xmath15 and the symmetric and antisymmetric cross sections @xmath16 and @xmath17 : @xmath18 we can then write the forward  backward asymmetry as @xmath19    in order to calculate this ratio perturbatively , we first separate the contributions to the cross sections into three classes : flavour non - singlet @xmath20 , flavour singlet @xmath21 , and interference ( or triangle ) @xmath22 ( see ref.@xcite for their precise definition ) . </S>",
    "<S> we thus write the cross sections as @xmath23 in this notation , up to @xmath24 there are only non - singlet contributions . </S>",
    "<S> thus , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are proportional to @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> there are no singlet contributions to the antisymmetric cross section @xmath17 .    </S>",
    "<S> the forward  backward asymmetry is decomposed in a similar way . </S>",
    "<S> expanding the ratio @xmath28 up to @xmath3 , we write @xmath29 where @xmath30 denotes the non - singlet component : @xmath31    the triangle contributions give non - universal ( i.e.  non - factorizable ) corrections to both the symmetric and antisymmetric cross sections . they are calculated in ref.@xcite for the @xmath2-quark axis definition and found to be very small . to our knowledge their contribution to the thrust axis definition has never been calculated , but we expect it to be similarly small . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore neglected it , i.e.  @xmath32 and @xmath26 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ afbdec ] ) , from our calculation .    </S>",
    "<S> the singlet contribution to the symmetric cross section , @xmath16 , is logarithmically enhanced in the small - mass limit and proportional to @xmath33 . an approximate expression for it , denoted by @xmath34 , was used in ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is calculated exactly to @xmath3 in refs.@xcite , and the leading and next - to - leading logarithms are summed to all orders in @xmath35 in ref.@xcite .    in some sense </S>",
    "<S> the singlet component is a ` background ' to the forward  backward asymmetry measurement and , in fact , in the experimental analyses ( see e.g.  ref.@xcite ) </S>",
    "<S> it is statistically subtracted using monte carlo event generators . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore neglected it , i.e.  @xmath36 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ afbdec ] ) , from our calculation .    before describing the calculation of @xmath30 , we take a slight diversion to discuss the contribution to it from four-@xmath2 final states . </S>",
    "<S> let us first point out a basic fact . </S>",
    "<S> the four-@xmath2 process contributes to both the @xmath2-quark cross sections @xmath16 and @xmath17 and the @xmath0 total cross section . </S>",
    "<S> however , they appear with different multiplicity factors in the two cases . in the case of the @xmath0 total cross section the multiplicity factor </S>",
    "<S> is simply equal to unity . in the contribution to the _ </S>",
    "<S> inclusive _ @xmath2-quark cross sections @xmath16 and @xmath17 , these terms count twice since there are two @xmath2 quarks in the final state . </S>",
    "<S> this observation is important in understanding the results for the non - singlet component of the symmetric cross section @xmath16 discussed shortly .    after summing and squaring the feynman diagrams for four-@xmath2 production , we obtain two types of contribution : @xmath37  those that are identical to the @xmath38 final state but with the other quark @xmath39 replaced by an untriggered - on @xmath2 quark , and @xmath40  those that are genuine interference terms arising from the fact that the two antiquarks are indistinguishable , called the @xmath41-term in ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the squared diagrams of type  @xmath37 are lumped together with the corresponding terms from @xmath38 in the singlet ( @xmath36 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sdecomp ] ) ) , non - singlet ( @xmath42 and @xmath43 in eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sdecomp ] ) and ( [ adecomp ] ) ) or triangle ( @xmath44 and @xmath26 in eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sdecomp ] ) and ( [ adecomp ] ) ) contributions . </S>",
    "<S> the squared diagrams of type  @xmath40 , which give a universal ( i.e.  factorizable ) correction to both the antisymmetric and symmetric cross sections , can be considered part of the non - singlet contributions .    </S>",
    "<S> it is not entirely clear how four - quark final states are actually treated in the different experimental analyses , i.e.  the extent to which they are genuinely measuring the inclusive cross sections . </S>",
    "<S> often some vague statement like `` a four-@xmath2 final state is more likely to be tagged than a two-@xmath2 one , but less than twice as likely '' is made . to know what to calculate one must understand the corrections that are applied for this difference in tagging efficiency , which are not usually explicitly stated in the papers . in the absence of a unique experimental procedure and of a definitive statement from the experiments on what they are measuring </S>",
    "<S> , we make this ambiguity explicit by multiplying the @xmath41-term by an arbitrary weight factor @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> an inclusive definition would correspond to @xmath46 ( each @xmath2 quark contributing once ) , while an exclusive definition ( the cross section for events containing at least one @xmath2 quark ) would correspond to @xmath47 . since the forward  </S>",
    "<S> backward asymmetry is defined to be the asymmetry of a differential cross section , it is clear that we must use the _ same _ cross section definition in the numerator and denominator , i.e.  that @xmath45 must be the same in the symmetric and antisymmetric cross sections .    </S>",
    "<S> having defined the weight factor @xmath45 for the @xmath41-term , we can define the following symmetric and antisymmetric cross sections @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 denote the integral of the symmetric and antisymmetric @xmath41-term , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we recall that the ` truly ' inclusive cross sections in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ saxs ] ) correspond to the definition with @xmath46 , i.e.  @xmath51 and @xmath52 .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath3-calculation of the cross sections in eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sxswe ] ,  [ axswe ] ) and of the corresponding forward  backward asymmetry in the case of a finite @xmath2-quark mass is extremely complicated , and we are not able to perform it . </S>",
    "<S> it is thus convenient to separate the calculation into a piece that is finite ( although still cumbersome ) in the massless limit and a simpler piece that is not . </S>",
    "<S> then , the finite piece can be more easily computed in the massless approximation , while the simpler non - finite piece can be computed in the massive theory .    </S>",
    "<S> it is possible to show@xcite that the inclusive definition , with @xmath46 , results in an antisymmetric cross section @xmath17 ( or , analogously , @xmath43 ) that is finite in the massless limit , at least at @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the same limit , the inclusive symmetric cross section is divergent at @xmath3 , even if we only consider its non - singlet component . </S>",
    "<S> the corrections to ( the non - singlet component of ) the forward  backward asymmetry itself must therefore also be divergent in the massless limit .    </S>",
    "<S> this final statement remains true for _ any _ value of @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> for example , with , the non - singlet part of the symmetric cross section is finite , but the antisymmetric cross section contains logarithmically - enhanced terms .    </S>",
    "<S> the divergences in the non - singlet components correspond to logarithmically - enhanced terms @xmath54 coming from the @xmath41-term in the triple - collinear limit , i.e.  when three fermions of the four - quark final state become simultaneously parallel . </S>",
    "<S> the integral of the symmetric @xmath41-term is calculated numerically in ref.@xcite and , neglecting corrections of @xmath55 , the final result is @xmath56,\\ ] ] where the analytic coefficient in front of @xmath57 is proportional to the integral of the non - singlet altarelli  </S>",
    "<S> parisi probability @xmath58 ( see , for instance , ref.@xcite ) : @xmath59 and the constant term is the result of our numerical calculation .    </S>",
    "<S> having pointed out that the symmetric @xmath41-term is divergent in the massless limit , it is very simple to show how the divergence appears in the inclusive symmetric cross section . according to the definition of the non - singlet component of @xmath60 , </S>",
    "<S> the virtual diagrams that contribute to @xmath42 are exactly those that contribute to the @xmath0 total cross section . as for the real diagrams , </S>",
    "<S> they only differ by the contributions coming from the @xmath41-term . in the total cross section </S>",
    "<S> , the @xmath41-term enters with a multiplicity factor @xmath47 , and its divergence is cancelled by that of the virtual diagrams . in the inclusive @xmath2-quark cross section , </S>",
    "<S> the multiplicity factor of the @xmath41-term is @xmath46 and , thus , the cancellation of the divergence with the virtual terms is spoiled .    </S>",
    "<S> this argument also allows us to directly compute the @xmath3-correction to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sxswe ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> exploiting the fact that the massless qcd correction to @xmath61 is equal to the correction @xmath62 to the total cross section , we write @xmath63 \\;\\;.\\ ] ] then , we obtain an explicit expression for @xmath64 by simply introducing in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sxswe2 ] ) our result in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ es ] ) for @xmath49 and the well - known result@xcite for @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , for the inclusive symmetric cross section we obtain @xmath65 \\;.\\ ] ]    since both @xmath66 and @xmath61 are finite when @xmath67 , we can use the dependence on @xmath45 to construct an unphysical observable that is finite in the massless limit : @xmath68 this observable is the ratio of the antisymmetric part of the _ inclusive _ cross section and the symmetric part of the _ exclusive _ cross section . </S>",
    "<S> thus @xmath69 is unphysical in the sense that it is not the forward </S>",
    "<S>  backward asymmetry of a single differential cross section . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless the definition in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ afbfinite ] ) helps us to perform a massless calculation . </S>",
    "<S> the physical result for @xmath46 is then given by @xmath70 where @xmath49 is the integral of the symmetric @xmath41-term , given in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ es ] ) .    even in the massless limit </S>",
    "<S> numerical two - loop calculations are prohibitively difficult to set up . </S>",
    "<S> fortunately there is a cancellation between the genuinely two - loop effects in the ratio on the right - hand - side of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ afbfinite ] ) , which does allow its numerical evaluation . </S>",
    "<S> the total contribution can be written as @xmath71 the @xmath24-contributions come from the one - loop cross sections @xmath72 for the two - parton process @xmath73 and the tree - level cross sections @xmath74 for the three - parton process @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> similarly the non - singlet @xmath3-contributions from the two - parton , three - parton and four - parton final states are denoted by @xmath76 @xmath77 and @xmath78 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> of course , the dependence on @xmath45 enters only through the four - parton terms @xmath79 and @xmath80 .    </S>",
    "<S> each of the cross sections is separately divergent , so they have to be regularized in some way before being combined together . in any regularization scheme that preserves the helicity conservation of massless qcd ) are explicitly violated for massive quarks . ] </S>",
    "<S> ( for example , dimensional regularization ) , we have the properties @xmath81 so that if we expand the ratio in eq .  ( [ ratio2 ] ) up to @xmath3 , the two - loop corrections cancel , and we obtain @xmath82 \\,,\\;\\;\\;\\nonumber    \\hspace*{-1cm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the complete contributions to the antisymmetric and symmetric cross sections at @xmath24 , @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> the first line can be calculated analytically , but the second line is too complicated to be able to , so must be done numerically . </S>",
    "<S> since the two - loop terms have cancelled , this has the structure of a nlo three - jet calculation , as first noticed by altarelli and lampe@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus the calculation can be performed using known techniques ( we use the dipole - formalism version of the subtraction method@xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we are finally ready to present our numerical results . </S>",
    "<S> we start with the unphysical , but finite , quantity defined in eq .  </S>",

    "<S> ( [ afbfull ] ,  [ afbbcntdef ] ) . _ _ [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we continue to neglect all terms that vanish in the massless limit . since in the existing experimental analyses ( see for example ref.@xcite ) , the known @xmath24 correction for the thrust axis definition was included , together with the altarelli and lampe quark axis value for the @xmath3 corrections , we do the same in table  [ tab : concl ] .    </S>",
    "<S> we find that the difference between the ravindran and van neerven calculation and ours is numerically irrelevant , being smaller than @xmath88 for @xmath2 quarks and @xmath89 for @xmath90 quarks . </S>",
    "<S> therefore at the numerical precision required by current or any foreseen experiments , we agree with their result   the difference is only one of principle . </S>",
    "<S> the difference between the altarelli and lampe calculation and ours for the quark axis definition is more significant though , at around 1% . </S>",
    "<S> however , the error in their calculation and the effect of using the thrust axis definition partially cancel , and the total difference is around 0.6% .    </S>",
    "<S> we should also mention the important fact , discussed in ref.@xcite , that the experimental procedures introduce a bias towards more two - jet - like events . </S>",
    "<S> this actually decreases the size of the qcd corrections considerably , so our number should be considered as an upper bound on the final difference .    </S>",
    "<S> in ref.@xcite we try to estimate the remaining uncertainties in the forward  backward asymmetry , bearing in mind that while the 2% precision of current experiments is close to their final limit , a future linear collider could be capable of experimental errors on the left  </S>",
    "<S> right forward  backward asymmetry of order 0.1%@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we found several sources of uncertainty that all contribute at the few per mille level . while this is certainly sufficient for the current precision of the data , matching the precision of a future linear collider measurement could be extremely difficult . </S>",
    "<S> it is likely that this could only be done by making even more stringent two - jet cuts in order to work in a region in which the corrections and their uncertainties are smaller . </S>"
