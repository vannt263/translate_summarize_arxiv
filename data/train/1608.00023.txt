    "one of the important motivations to study hybrid many - terminal nanostructures with normal and superconducting leads is a perspective to obtain the non - locally entangled electrons  @xcite .",
    "electrons of s - wave superconductors are known to exist in the spin singlet , maximally entangled states .",
    "when two electrons forming such cooper pair are split ( on interface between superconductor and other materials ) , they still preserve entanglement albeit being spatially separated .",
    "splitting mechanism can be achieved  @xcite by the andreev scattering processes . in many - terminal hybrid device with one superconducting electrode ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]a ) the crossed andreev reflection ( car ) occurs when one of the electrons enters , say left ( l ) electrode while its partner goes to the right ( r ) one .",
    "the cooper pair splitting ( cps ) in such y - shape junctions has been proposed theoretically  @xcite and realised experimentally by several groups  @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that the highest efficiency of cps can be achieved in three - terminal hybrid devices using the double quantum dots with strong intradot coulomb repulsion  @xcite .",
    "we have previously analysed the y - shape junction with only a single quantum dot  @xcite , where interplay between the local and non - local processes is controlled by suitable choice of the quantum dot level , the couplings and applied voltages @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the thermoelectric properties  @xcite of this three terminal hybrid system has shown that seebeck coefficient can be large , but the symmetry of the model prevents a direct contribution of the car to both the local and non - local thermopower  @xcite .",
    "regions in the parameter space , where car processes are dominant under realistic experimental conditions  @xcite are expected to be also useful for the efficient cps .",
    "it is the aim of this work to quantify such conjecture by calculating cps efficiency as defined in eq .",

    "@xmath65 the cps efficiency @xmath55 is a symmetrica function of the applied bias voltage @xmath1 .",
    "the cps efficiency diminishes with an increasing coulomb repulsion . for small voltages , when system is in the coulomb blockade regime ( _ i.e. _ in the region between the inner andreev bound states ) there appears a dip , where @xmath55 is reduced .",
    "it is in contrast with the noninteracting case where the maximum of @xmath55 appeared between andreev bound states .",
    "this behaviour is manifestation of the coulomb blockade effect , which suppresses the car processes more efficiently then the et processes  @xcite .",

    "when the electron - hole symmetry is broken ( _ e.g. _ for @xmath3 ) we can notice that the cps efficiency characteristics are asymmetric with respect to the @xmath66 .",
