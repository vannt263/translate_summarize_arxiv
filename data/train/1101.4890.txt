    "although newton s gravity law and einstein s general relativity have given marvelous understanding about gravity , it is still the most mysterious problem in the whole field of science @xcite .",
    "it is widely believed that the unification of gravity and quantum mechanics and the unification of gravity and other three fundamental forces are impossible in the foreseeable future .",
    "one of the main reason is that the abnormal effects observed by experiments on earth are highly scarce . to observe possible abnormal effects , most recently , adler , mueller and",
    "perl @xcite proposed a terrestrial search for dark contents of the vacuum using atom interferometry , somewhat similarly to the michelson - morley experiment .",
    "recently , verlinde s work @xcite has renewed enthusiasm @xcite of the possibility that gravity is an entropy force , rather than a fundamental force @xcite .",
    "of course , if gravity is not a fundamental force , we should reconsider the unification of quantum mechanics and gravity .",
    "inspired by the thermodynamic origin of gravity for classical objects , we will try to consider several fundamental problems : ( i ) why the gravity between two classical objects is attractive ?",
    "( ii ) does there exist new and observable quantum gravity effect ?",
    "( iii ) whether there is new clue to solve the mechanism of accelerating universe ?    in this paper , the quantum effect of gravity is studied based on the general principle that gravity originates from the coupling and thermal equilibrium between matter and vacuum background . for classical particles",
    ", this general principle gives the newton s gravity law .",
    "for particles described by quantum wave packets , we predict an abnormal quantum effect of gravity . based on this abnormal quantum gravity effect",
    ", we consider the possible origin of the dark energy from the coupling and thermal equilibrium between matter and vacuum background .",
    "quite surprising , the ratio of the dark energy in our simple calculations is @xmath2 , which agrees quantitatively with the result 7/3 obtained from various astronomical observations @xcite .",
    "our works also show that , with a sphere full of superfluid helium , there is a feasible experimental scheme to test our idea with a gravimeter placed in the sphere .",
    "the sensitivities of @xmath0 below @xmath1 could be used to test our idea , which satisfy the present experimental technique of atom interferometer @xcite , free - fall absolute gravimeters @xcite and superconducting gravimeters @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , in sec .",
    "ii , we consider the change of entropy for a particle with a displacement in space . for a particle with an acceleration , we give a derivation of the vacuum temperature due to the coupling between matter and vacuum .",
    "based on the consideration of local thermal equilibrium , we give the acceleration of a particle in the presence of a finite vacuum temperature field distribution . in sec .",
    "iii , we give a derivation of newton s law of gravitation .",
    "in particular , we explain the physical mechanism of the attractive gravity between two classical objects . in sec .",
    "iv , we give a brief discussion of the physical mechanism of the equivalence principle based on the thermodynamic origin of gravity . in sec .",
    "v , we consider an abnormal quantum gravity effect for a particle described by the wave function in quantum mechanics . in sec .",
    "vi , we consider an experimental scheme to test this abnormal quantum gravity effect with a superfluid helium sphere .",
    "the application of this abnormal quantum gravity effect to test many - world interpretation and de broglie - bohm theory is discussed .",
    "we also discuss the application of this abnormal quantum gravity effect to condensed matter physics . in sec .",
    "vii , we give the field equation including the quantum gravity effect of vacuum excitations .",
    "this gives a possible interpretation of the repulsive gravity effect of dark energy . in sec .",
    "viii , we calculate the dark energy density from the general principle in this work . in sec .",
    "ix , the general field equation including the classical and quantum gravity effect of matter and radiation is given .",
    "we give relevant summary and discussions in the last section .",
    "compared with electromagnetism , weak interaction and strong interaction , the gravitation has several different features .",
    "( i ) the gravitation is universal .",
    "( ii ) the gravitation `` charge '' is in a sense the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "hence , the gravitation `` charge '' is not quantized .",
    "( iii ) the coupling between the energy - momentum tensor and spacetime leads to the gravity force for another particle .",
    "( iv ) the gravity law closely resembles the laws of thermodynamics and hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "these features strongly suggest that the gravitation deserves studies with completely different idea , compared with other forces .",
    "it is well known that the force in classical and quantum gases can be understood in a natural way with statistical mechanics . following the intensive pioneering works to eliminate the gravitation from a fundamental force",
    ", we will study the thermodynamic origin of gravitation , and in particular the quantum gravity effect when both quantum mechanics and thermodynamics are considered .",
    "although the theoretical predication about the abnormal quantum gravity effect addresses a lot of subtle problems , our starting points are the following two formulas about the change of entropy for a displacement of a particle , and the vacuum temperature because of the vacuum excitations induced by an accelerating object .",
    "\\(1 ) the formula about the change of entropy @xmath4 after a displacement @xmath5 for a particle with mass @xmath6 . @xmath7 in the original work by verlinde @xcite , this postulation motivated by bekenstein s work @xcite about black holes and entropy , plays a key role in deriving the newton s law of gravitation .",
    "the above formula means that after a displacement @xmath5 for a particle with mass @xmath6 , there is an entropy increase of @xmath4 for the whole system . to understand this formula ,",
    "we emphasize three aspects about this formula .",
    "( i ) the whole system about the entropy includes the vacuum background .",
    "( ii ) there is a strong coupling between the particle and vacuum background .",
    "this can be understood after little thought . without a strong coupling , it is nonsense to define the location and time for a particle existing in the spacetime ( @xmath8 the vacuum background ) .",
    "( iii ) as a medium for various matters , the zero - point ( or ground - state ) energy density of the vacuum background is extremely large with the standard quantum field theory .",
    "the vacuum zero - point energy density is of the order of @xmath9 if the energy cutoff is the planck energy .",
    "this also gives the reason why there is a strong coupling between matter and vacuum .    in a sense ,",
    "the motion of a particle in the vacuum background is a little similar to a speedboat moving in the sea .",
    "the speedboat left behind a navigation path in the sea .",
    "after a navigation of distance @xmath5 , the speedboat stopped . after waiting sufficient time , we can not know the navigation path in the sea . if the location resolution in the navigation path in the sea is @xmath10 , about @xmath11 bits of information are lost .",
    "in this situation , there is an entropy increase of @xmath12 . for a matter ( similar to the speedboat ) moving in the vacuum background ( similar to the sea ) , it is similar to understand the relation @xmath12 with @xmath10 being the location resolution in the sight of the vacuum background .    here",
    "we consider a method to calculate the location resolution @xmath10 . from special relativity ,",
    "the energy of the particle is @xmath13 .",
    "together with quantum mechanics , the eigenfrequency is @xmath14 .",
    "it is understandable that various gauge fields in the vacuum have the propagation velocity of light velocity @xmath15 .",
    "hence , the relative velocity between matter and the gauge field in the vacuum is @xmath15 . in this situation",
    ", we get the coherence length @xmath10 of the particle in the sight of the vacuum background . with the standard quantum mechanics method",
    ", we have @xmath16 .",
    "this coherence length can also be regarded as the location resolution in the sight of the vacuum background .",
    "more detailed discussions about this coherence length and entropy are given in the appendix .",
    "\\(2 ) vacuum temperature induced by a uniformly accelerating object in the vacuum  background .    considering a particle with acceleration @xmath17",
    ", we have @xmath18 here @xmath19 . in this paper ,",
    "all bold symbols represent vectors . from eq .",
    "( [ entropy ] ) , we have    @xmath20    in addition , from @xmath21 , we have@xmath22 using the fundamental thermodynamic relation @xmath23 for the whole system including the vacuum background , we have@xmath24 in this process , there is no entropy increase for the particle itself .",
    "the entropy increase comes from the vacuum .",
    "hence , @xmath25 refers to the vacuum temperature at the location of the particle .",
    "because temperature is a concept of statistical average , rigorously speaking , the right - hand side of the above expression should be written as the form of statistical average , @xmath8@xmath26 if the fluctuations of the acceleration can be omitted , we have@xmath27 this shows that the acceleration of a particle will induce vacuum excitations , and thus lead to finite vacuum temperature .",
    "although the above formula is the same as the unruh temperature @xcite , the physical meaning is in a sense different from that of the unruh effect . in the present work",
    ", the temperature @xmath25 denotes the vacuum temperature due to the vacuum excitations .",
    "because the unruh effect itself addresses a lot of subtle problems , in this paper , we will not discuss the detailed difference between @xmath25 and unruh temperature .",
    "we will apply the above expression with our understanding of @xmath25 in this work .     for the particle",
    "b , the acceleration induces a temperature field distribution shown by the blue dashed line , with the peak value given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : u2 ] ) .",
    "the local thermal equilibrium requests that this peak value is equal to the temperature of the vacuum temperature field ( red line ) at location b. this gives the physical mechanism why the particle b will accelerate in the presence of a finite vacuum temperature field.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    the meaning of the above equation is further shown in fig .",
    "1 . for a particle at location",
    "b with acceleration @xmath28 ( shown by the dashed red arrow ) , the coupling between the particle and the vacuum establishes a temperature field distribution shown by the dashed blue line with peak value @xmath29 . in a sense , the strong coupling between the particle and the vacuum leads to a `` dressed '' state which includes the local vacuum excitations and the particle itself .",
    "if the particle has no size , the width of the local vacuum excitations is of the order of the planck length , with the same consideration of the derivation of the newton s law of gravitation in the following section .    in fig .",
    "1 , there is a temperature field distribution shown by the red line . at location b ,",
    "there is a particle denoted by red sphere . to establish local thermal equilibrium ,",
    "the red sphere will accelerate so that the peak temperature of the dressed state is equal to the temperature of the vacuum temperature field at the location b , @xmath8 @xmath30 .",
    "in this situation , we have@xmath31    however , the acceleration is a vector , while the temperature is a scalar .",
    "therefore , the above formula is not clear about the direction of the acceleration .",
    "we further consider the free energy of the whole system which is defined as @xmath32 . here",
    "@xmath33 is the overall energy of the system , which is a conserved quantity . because the system evolution has the tendency to decrease the free energy with the most effective way , we get the following formula to determine the magnitude and direction of the acceleration in the presence of a vacuum temperature field.@xmath34 here @xmath35 denotes a three - dimensional spatial vector . in fig .",
    "1 , for the particle at location b , the direction of the acceleration is determined based on the consideration of the free energy",
    ". we will show in due course that the above equation will interpret why the gravity force is attractive between two spatially separated objects .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ unruhvector ] ) is invalid for uniformly distributed vacuum temperature field . for uniformly distributed vacuum temperature field such as location",
    "1 , from the consideration of the free energy , the direction of the acceleration of a particle is completely random .",
    "this means that the direction of the acceleration is highly fluctuating .",
    "although @xmath36 for this case , @xmath37 if the uniformly distributed vacuum temperature is nonzero . by using eq . (",
    "[ eq : statemperature ] ) , we have @xmath38 .    from @xmath39 and @xmath23 , we have @xmath40 . using eqs .",
    "( [ x])-([t ] ) , we have@xmath41 from the above equation , we get the following inertia law ( newton s second law ) @xmath42 of course , from @xmath39 we can directly get this inertia law .",
    "the above derivation of the inertia law shows that it is self - consistent to consider the origin of classic force from statistical mechanics and the coupling between matter and vacuum background .",
    "if @xmath43 , we have @xmath44 .",
    "this is newton s first law .",
    "the coupling between the particle and vacuum background , and the consistency with newton s first law suggest that the vacuum background is in a sense a superfluid . in this superfluid ,",
    "the propagator velocity of various gauge fields is the light velocity @xmath15 . if @xmath15 is regarded as the sound velocity of the vacuum background , the critical velocity to break the superfluidity is @xmath15 .",
    "as discussed in previous section , the coupling between particle and vacuum background leads to an entropy increase for a displacement .",
    "the physical mechanism of this entropy increase is that there is a strong coupling between matter and vacuum . in this section ,",
    "we give a derivation of newton s law of gravitation physically originating from these vacuum excitations .    ) for the vacuum fluctuations .",
    "the red sphere shows a particle which leads to a vacuum temperature field distribution , through the coupling with the vacuum.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    when there are vacuum excitations due to the coupling between matter and space , we assume @xmath45 as the correlation length of the vacuum excitations . at least for the situations considered in the present work , the vacuum excitation energy density is much smaller than the vacuum zero - point energy density .",
    "we will show in due course that @xmath45 is of the order of the planck length @xmath46 with @xmath47 being the gravitational constant , which is the length scale at which the structure of spacetime becomes dominated by quantum gravity effect . in fig .",
    "2 , we consider the three - dimensional space with @xmath45 showing the structure of the space due to quantum gravity effect .",
    "although the microscopic mechanism of @xmath45 is not completely clear , it is not unreasonable to assume the existence of @xmath45 in the structure of the space .",
    "these lowest space structures are a little similar to atoms in a solid .",
    "we assume the energy of a particle shown by red sphere in fig . 2 is @xmath48 .",
    "we further assume the freedom of the lowest space structure is @xmath49 .",
    "from the local thermal equilibrium , at the location of the particle , the temperature of the vacuum is determined by@xmath50 here @xmath51 denotes a dimensionless coupling strength between matter and space . from the ordinary statistical mechanics , @xmath52 should be of the order of @xmath53 .",
    "we have@xmath54    when @xmath55 , @xmath43 .",
    "hence , one expects the temperature field distribution shown in fig .",

    "the spherical symmetry of the system for @xmath58 is also used .",
    "this explains the attractive gravity force between two classical objects .",
    "it is worthy to point out that both in newton s gravitation law and einstein s general relativity , this attractive gravity force is imposed from the observation results , rather than microscopic mechanism .",
    "one of the merit of thermodynamics lies in that even we do not know the exact collision property such as scattering length between atoms , the macroscopic force such as pressure can be derived .",
    "when the thermodynamic origin of gravity is adopted , there is a request that one gets the correct result of the direction of gravity force .",

    "( [ eq : tvr0 ] ) , we have @xmath62 . although we do not know the exact value of @xmath63 , it is understandable that @xmath63 is of the order of @xmath53 . in this situation ,",

    "whose size is of the order of the planck length .",
    "if the size of the particle is larger than the planck length , by using the gauss s flux theorem , for @xmath70 being much larger than the size of the particle , the above result still holds .",

    "5 , we assume the temperature field distribution due to the @xmath49th particle is @xmath79 . because there is no quantum interference effect between different classical particles ,",
    "the force ( a measurement result in quantum mechanics ) on the object with mass @xmath6 is    @xmath80    the above expression is based on the assumption of the linear superposition of gravity force @xmath81 . in the newton s law of gravitation for an assembly of classical particles , this implicit assumption is also used .",

    "this method to calculate the gravity force should be ruled out .",
    "the reason of the error in the above calculations lies in the method to get @xmath25 .",
    "even for the ordinary situation , the above method to get @xmath25 is also not correct .",

    "it is well known that the equivalence principle is based on the assumption that the gravitational mass @xmath88 is equal to the inertial mass @xmath89 .",
    "it is still a mystery why @xmath90 because it seems that the gravitational mass and inertial mass are different physical concept , if the gravity force is regarded as a fundamental force , similarly to other fundamental forces .",
    "for example , for electromagnetism , the inertial mass is completely different from the electric charge leading to electromagnetism .",
    "previous studies clearly show that if the thermodynamic origin of gravity force is adopted , the gravitational mass and the inertial mass are the same mass in the mass - energy relation in special relativity . in all our derivations , we do not need especially introduce the gravitational mass at all . in this situation ,",
    "the gravitational mass and inertial mass are in fact the same physical concept .",
    "hence , it is not surprising that @xmath90 .    as discussed previously ,",
    "the velocity of light is in a sense the sound velocity of the vacuum .",
    "if the vacuum is regarded as a superfluid , there is a breakdown of the superfluidity if the velocity of an object is larger than @xmath15 .",
    "this gives a possible physical mechanism why @xmath15 is the speed limit for all objects .",
    "hence , the validity of special relativity is in a sense determined by the vacuum background where there is a finite and extremely large zero - point energy density .",
    "in other words , it s the vacuum background which leads to the theory of special relativity .",
    "this is the reason why there is an internal relation between @xmath15 and vacuum zero - point energy density .    in a sufficiently small region of a freely falling system ,",
    "the temperature due to the acceleration of this system is equal to the vacuum temperature field . in this small region ,",
    "the object will not experience the finite vacuum temperature effect .",
    "this suggests the validity of the strong principle of equivalence .",
    "hence , when the quantum effect is included in the field equation of gravitation , we will adopt the strong principle of equivalence , which is also adopted by einstein in deriving his field equation for gravitation .    from @xmath12 and @xmath91",
    ", we see that there is another definition of the mass . for different fundamental particles ,",
    "there are different correlation lengths in the coupling between particles and vacuum .",
    "the mass is then @xmath92 .",

    "apart from atom interferometer , the measurement of gravity acceleration with bloch oscillation @xcite for cold atoms in optical lattices , superfluid helium interferometry @xcite , free - fall absolute gravimeters @xcite and superconducting gravimeters @xcite provide other methods to test the abnormal quantum gravity effect .",
    "in particular , the standard deviation of free - fall absolute gravimeters in the present technique is about @xmath150 @xcite , while the superconducting gravimeters have achieved the sensitivities of one thousandth of one billionth ( @xmath151 ) of the earth surface gravity .",
    "because this abnormal quantum gravity effect could be tested by contrast experiment with superfluid helium and normal helium , and the prediction that this abnormal quantum gravity effect is location - dependent , the sensitivities of a gravimeter could be used to test the abnormal quantum gravity effect .",
    "this makes it very promising to test the abnormal quantum gravity effect in future experiments .    because highly localized helium atoms will not lead to quantum effect of gravity",
    ", the measurement of acceleration will give us new chance to measure the fraction of highly localized helium atoms , which is still an important and challenging topic in condensed matter physics .",
    "in our theory , the quantum effect of gravity does not rely on superfluid behavior .",
    "it depends on whether the wave packet of a particle is localized .",
    "it is well known that whether there is wave packet localization is a central topic in condensed matter physics and material physics , such as the long - range order problem at a phase transition .",
    "considering the remarkable advances in various gravimeters , it is promising that the quantum gravity effect would have potential applications in our understanding of condensed matter physics and material physics , _",
    "etc_.    a possible risk in the decisive test of the abnormal quantum gravity effect with superfluid helium sphere lies in our understanding of the superfluid behavior of liquid helium . in the ordinary understanding of superfluid helium ,",
    "the superfluid fraction can achieve almost @xmath152 while the condensate fraction is about @xmath153 @xcite .",
    "because of the strong interaction between helium atoms , the liquid helium is a very complex strongly correlated system .",
    "considering the fact that there are a lot of open questions in strongly correlated systems , we can not absolutely exclude the possibility that the wave packets of all helium atoms are localized , although the whole system still exhibits superfluid behavior .",
    "this significantly differs from the bose - einstein condensate in dilute gases , where the wave function of the atoms in the condensate is certainly delocalized in the whole condensate .",
    "the abnormal quantum gravity effect gives a possible experimental scheme to test many - world interpretation @xcite .",
    "in many - world interpretation , there is no  true  wave packet collapse process . for a particle described by a wave packet",
    ", the measurement result of the particle at a location does not mean that the wave packet of this particle at other locations disappears .",
    "it suggests that the wave function of the whole universe evolves into a series of orthogonal many - body wave functions due to the interaction between the measurement apparatus and the particle .",
    "the observed result of the particle at a location corresponds to one of the orthogonal many - body wave functions .",
    "considering again the superfluid helium sphere , if we increase the temperature so that it becomes normal liquid , based on the many - world interpretation , the wave packets of helium atoms ( at least the fraction of the helium atoms initially in the condensate ) are still delocalized in the whole sphere .",
    "in this situation , if the many - world interpretation is correct , it is possible that one may also get the abnormal quantum gravity effect .",
    "this would mean a gravity effect dependent on the history of a system .",
    "at least , it seems that all previous experiments or astronomical observations do not overrule this possibility .",
    "the present work clearly shows that it s time to consider more seriously the new view of gravity , in particularly by future experiments .",
    "particles with the same wave function @xmath154 , based on the de broglie - bohm theory.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    in the above studies of the quantum gravity effect , we adopt in a sense the ordinary understanding of quantum mechanics .",
    "it is worthy to consider the quantum gravity effect based on other understanding of quantum mechanics .",
    "here we give a brief discussion with the de brogliebohm theory .",
    "we consider @xmath83 particles with the same wave function @xmath155 shown in fig .",
    "9 . in this pilot - wave theory",
    ", the particle is still a highly localized particle with a well - defined trajectory guided by the wave function .",
    "we can not predict the exact location of a particle because the initial position of the particle is not controllable by the experimenter , and the motion of the particle guided by the wave function is determined by the initial position of the particle . if we assume further that the energy is mainly carried by the particle , rather than the wave , for the situation shown in fig .",
    "9 , the gravity effect due to these @xmath83 particles would be the same as that of @xmath83 classical particles whose density is @xmath156 .",
    "hence , this experimental scheme also gives us chance to test the de broglie - bohm theory .",
    "if the abnormal quantum gravity effect is verified , the de broglie - bohm theory would be excluded in a sense .",
    "as shown in sec .",
    "iv , the gravitational mass and inertial mass are the same mass in einstein s mass - energy relation , when gravity force is regarded as a thermodynamic effect .",
    "this explains in a natural way the equivalence principle . for the existence of vacuum excitations at location @xmath157 , a local reference system with acceleration given by eq .",
    "( [ acc ] ) will not experience these vacuum excitations .",
    "therefore , in this reference system , the physical law of special relativity would hold .",

    "because different locations can have different accelerations , different locations have different reference systems satisfying the physical law of special relativity . to construct the connection between the reference systems at different locations , riemannian geometry is the most convenient mathematical tool .",
    "therefore , although we try to argue here that thermodynamics and the coupling between matter and vacuum are the essential mechanisms of gravity force , riemannian geometry is still needed to construct a systematic theory , because of the same reason in constructing einstein s general relativity .    to clearly introduce the new field equation including the quantum effect of gravity , we first give a brief introduction of einstein s field equation for classical object ( see ref .",

    "these temperature field distributions lead to the force for the matter and radiation in the universe .",
    "as shown previously , the physical mechanism of these temperature field distributions is due to the vacuum excitations . in higher - order calculations , the gravity effect of the vacuum excitations themselves",

    "because the vacuum excitations are virtual processes from the view of quantum field theory , these vacuum excitations are different from the ordinary matter . because of this , these vacuum excitations can not be described by the form of the energy - momentum tensor for the ordinary matter or radiation . in a sense , these vacuum excitations are integrated into the space time . fortunately , in principle , one can add an extra term in eq .",

    "hence , even the abnormal gravity effect for superfluid helium is excluded in future experiments , it is still possible that the theory of the present work could be applied to accelerating universe .",
    "one may consider the problem that whether there is abnormal quantum gravity effect in the interior of a neutron star .",
    "if the temperature ( not the vacuum temperature ) of the neutron star is zero and the wave packets of all neutrons are delocalized in the whole interior of the neutron star , we would expect an abnormal quantum gravity effect .",
    "however , the temperature of the neutron state is in fact extremely high .",
    "the typical temperature of a neutron star is about @xmath303 kelvins .",
    "in addition , the neutron star is not an ideal fermi system without the consideration of the interaction between neutrons .",
    "the neutron star comprises very complex structures , such as the out core consisting of neutron - proton fermi liquid and the inner core consisting of possible quark gluon plasma . in quantum statistical mechanics , the approximate model of the neutron star as an ideal fermi system holds because of the validity of the local density approximation .",
    "the validity of this ideal fermi system does not mean that the wave packets of all neutrons are delocalized in the whole interior of the neutron star .",
    "considering the extremely high temperature and complex structure of the neutron star , it is more reasonable to assume that the delocalized scale of the wave packet of the neutrons is much smaller than the size of the neutron star ( the typical size of a neutron star is about @xmath304 km ) . in this situation , we still expect the normal gravity effect in the interior of the neutron star .",

    "( [ entropy ] ) about the entropy increase of a particle having a displacement , there is another request of the loss of information about the trajectory of the particle . in fig .",
    "11(a ) , we show the motion of a particle along the dashed line .",
    "because of the location resolution from the view of the vacuum background , the dashed line is partitioned by the box with side length @xmath10 . at time @xmath305 , the wave packet of the particle is shown by the dashed line . at a later time",
    "@xmath306 ( @xmath307 ) , the wave packet of the particle is shown by the solid line . at time @xmath306 , the information of the location of the particle at time @xmath305 recorded by the vacuum background will be lost because of two reasons : ( 1 ) at time @xmath306 , although the location of the particle with spatial resolution @xmath10 is recorded by the vacuum background , the velocity information is highly uncertain . from @xmath308 , the velocity uncertainty of the particle is @xmath309 .",
    "in this situation , at time @xmath306 , after the position of the particle is recorded by the vacuum background , the history of the particle is lost from the view of the vacuum background .",
    "( 2 ) at time @xmath305 , although the location with spatial resolution @xmath10 is recorded by the vacuum background , it will be lost rapidly after a displacement at time @xmath306 . at time @xmath305 , the location record is due to the coupling between the particle and the vacuum background . in other words , due to the coupling between the particle and the vacuum background , at the location of the particle at time @xmath305 , the vacuum has larger fluctuations .",
    "it s these spatial - dependent vacuum fluctuations record the location of the particle with resolution @xmath10 . because the vacuum background is highly fluctuating , at time @xmath306",
    ", the location information at time @xmath305 will be lost because of the re - establishment of the thermal equilibrium in the vacuum background .",
    "\\(i ) in the above derivation , we assume a strong coupling between the particle and the vacuum background , so that the location of the particle can be recorded by the vacuum background . when quantum field theory is used , the vacuum background is in fact full of various gauge fields , virtual matter - antimatter pairs .",
    "this implies a strong coupling between the particle and the vacuum background .",
    "\\(ii ) one should distinguish two sorts of coherence lengths : the coherence length @xmath10 and the ordinary thermal de broglie wave length .",
    "in the non - relativistic approximation , the thermal de broglie wave length reflects the spatial coherence length which is @xmath311 .",
    "we stress that @xmath10 and @xmath310 have different physical origins .",
    "@xmath10 originates from the coupling between the particle and the vacuum background .",
    "because of the extremely large vacuum zero - point energy and strong coupling between matter and vacuum , the special relativity and quantum mechanics are used to calculate @xmath10 .",
    "in contrast to @xmath10 , @xmath310 originates from the coupling or interaction between the particle we study and other particles or environment . to clearly elaborate this",
    ", we take a hydrogen atom as an example , which consists of an electron and a proton . for a system consisting of a large number of hydrogen atoms , @xmath312 with @xmath313 being the ordinary temperature in thermal equilibrium . @xmath310",
    "physically originates from the interatomic interaction or the coupling with the environment . for bose - einstein condensation of atomic hydrogen @xcite ,",
    "@xmath310 can arrive at @xmath314  . in fig .",
    "11(c ) , we show @xmath10 and @xmath310 for an atom .",
    "\\(iii ) although there is a velocity uncertainty @xmath309 for a particle due to the strong coupling with the vacuum , we stress that this does not mean that the particle will have highly random motion in the vacuum without other forces .",
    "the reason lies in that the coupling between a particle and the vacuum will lead a `` dressed '' state including the local vacuum excitations . as a whole",
    ", the velocity uncertainty could be much smaller than @xmath15 .",
    "this is a little similar to the electron in a hydrogen atom . in the view of proton in the hydrogen atom ,",
    "the velocity uncertainty of the electron is about @xmath315 with @xmath316 being the electron mass and @xmath317 the size of the hydrogen atom .",
    "however , for the hydrogen atom as a whole , the velocity uncertainty is determined by the wave packet of the hydrogen atom , rather than the electron . in a sense , it is possible that there is a physical mechanism of spatially resolved quantum non - demolition detection @xcite about the particle by the vacuum with spatial resolution @xmath10 .",
