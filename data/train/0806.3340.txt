    "normal function of the human spine is possible due to a complex interaction of its components ( i.e. , vertebrae , ligaments , discs , rib cage , and muscles ) .",
    "age , trauma , spinal disorders , and a host of other parameters can disrupt this interaction to an extent that in certain cases surgery may be required to restore normal function .",
    "several spinal disorders have been described in @xcite from a mechanical perspective .",
    "an understanding of these disorders can assist in the design and development of spinal instrumentation . as biomechanics begins to be intertwined with tissue engineering , a better understanding of the particular disorders",
    "may also provide insight into ` biological ' solutions .",
    "in particular , the center of rotation of the upper cervical spine is an important biomechanical landmark that is used to determine upper neck moment , particularly when evaluating injury risk in the automotive environment @xcite .",
    "also , new vehicle safety standards are designed to limit the amount of neck tension and extension seen by out - of - position motor vehicle occupants during airbag deployments .",
    "the criteria used to assess airbag injury risk are currently based on volunteer data and animal studies due to a lack of bending tolerance data for the adult cervical spine @xcite .    also , lumbar spine pathology accounts for billions of dollars in societal costs each year .",
    "although the symptomatology of these conditions is relatively well understood , the mechanical changes in the spine are not .",
    "previous direct measurements of lumbar spine mechanics have mostly been performed on cadavers .",
    "the methods for in vivo studies have included imaging , electrogoniometry , and motion capture .",
    "few studies have directly measured in vivo lumbar spine kinematics with in - dwelling bone pins .",
    "in vivo 3d motion of the entire lumbar spine has recently been tracked during gait in @xcite . using a direct ( pin - based ) in vivo measurement method ,",
    "the motion of the human lumbar spine during gait was found to be triaxial .",
    "this appears to be the first 3d motion analysis of the entire lumbar spine using indwelling pins .",
    "the results were similar to previously published data derived from a variety of experimental methods .",
    "the traditional _ principal loading hypothesis _ @xcite , which describes general spinal injuries in terms of spinal tension , compression , bending , and shear , is insufficient to predict and prevent the cause of the back - pain syndrome .",
    "its underlying mechanics is simply not accurate enough . on the other hand , to be recurrent , musculo - skeletal injury must be associated with a histological change , i.e. , the modification of associated tissues within the body .",
    "however , incidences of _ functional _ musculoskeletal injury , e.g. , lower back pain , generally shows little evidence of _ structural _ damage @xcite .",
    "the incidence of injury is likely to be a continuum ranging from little or no evidence of structural damage through to the observable damage of muscles , joints or bones .",
    "the changes underlying functional injuries are likely to consist of torn muscle fibers , stretched ligaments , subtle erosion of join tissues , and/or the application of pressure to nerves , all amounting to a disruption of function to varying degrees and a tendency toward spasm .",
    "for example , in a review of experimental studies on the role of mechanical stresses in the genesis of intervertebral disk degeneration and herniation @xcite , the authors dismissed simple mechanical stimulations of functional vertebra as a cause of disk herniation , concluding instead that a complex mechanical stimulation combining forward and lateral bending of the spine followed by violent compression is needed to produce posterior herniation of the disk . considering the use of models to estimate the risk of injury",
    "the authors emphasize the need to understand this complex interaction between the mechanical forces and the living body @xcite .",
    "compressive and shear loading increased significantly with exertion load , lifting velocity , and trunk asymmetry @xcite . also , it has been stated that up to two  thirds of all back injuries have been associated with trunk rotation @xcite .",
    "in addition , load  lifting in awkward environment places a person at risk for low back pain and injury @xcite .",
    "these risks appear to be increased when facing up or down an inclined surface .",
    "the safe spinal motions ( flexion / extension , lateral flexion and rotation ) _ are _ governed by standard euler s rotational intervertebral dynamics coupled to newton s micro - translational dynamics . on the other hand , the unsafe spinal events , the main cause of spinal injuries , are caused by intervertebral se(3)jolts , the sharp and sudden , delta ( forces + torques ) combined , localized both in time and in space .",
    "these localized intervertebral se(3)jolts do not belong to the standard newton ",
    "euler dynamics .",
    "the only way to monitor them would be to measure  in vivo \" the rate of the combined ( forces + torques) rise .",
    "it is well known that the mechanical properties of spinal ligaments and muscles are rate dependent . as elongation rate increases ,",
    "ligaments generally exhibit higher stiffness , higher failure force , and smaller failure strain .",
    "previous studies have shown that high - speed multiplanar loading causes soft tissue injury that is more severe as compared to sagittal loading .",
    "this paper proposes a new locally  coupled loading  rate hypothesis , which states that the main cause of both soft and hard  tissue spinal injury is a localized euclidean jolt , or @xmath0jolt , an impulsive loading that strikes a localized spine in several coupled degrees - of - freedom ( dof ) simultaneously . to show this ,",
    "based on the previously defined covariant force law , we formulate the coupled newton  euler dynamics of the local spinal motions and derive from it the corresponding coupled @xmath0jolt dynamics .",
    "the @xmath0jolt is the main cause of two forms of local discontinuous spinal injury : ( i ) hard  tissue injury of local translational dislocations ; and ( ii ) soft  tissue injury of local rotational disclinations .",
    "both the spinal dislocations and disclinations , as caused by the @xmath0jolt , are described using the cosserat multipolar viscoelastic continuum model .    while we can intuitively visualize the se(3)jolt , for the purpose of simulation we use the necessary simplified , decoupled approach ( neglecting the 3d torque matrix and its coupling to the 3d force vector ) .",
    "note that decoupling is a kind of linearization that prevents chaotic behavior , giving an illusion of full predictability . in this decoupled framework of reduced complexity , we define :    the cause of hard spinal injuries ( discus hernia ) is a linear 3d  jolt vector hitting some intervertebral joint",
    " the time rate - of - change of a 3d  force vector ( linear jolt = mass @xmath2 linear jerk ) .",
    "the cause of soft spinal injuries ( back  pain syndrome ) is an angular 3axial jolt hitting some intervertebral joint ",
    "the time rate - of - change of a 3axial torque ( angular jolt = inertia moment @xmath2 angular jerk ) .",
    "this decoupled framework has been implemented in the human biodynamics engine @xcite , a world  class neuro  musculo ",
    "skeletal dynamics simulator ( with 270 dofs , the same number of equivalent muscular actuators and two  level neural reflex control ) , developed by the present author at defence science and technology organization , australia .",
    "this kinematically validated human motion simulator has been described in a series of papers and books @xcite , + @xcite , + @xcite .",
    "in the language of modern biodynamics @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , the general spinal motion is governed by the euclidean se(3)group of 3d motions ( see figure [ ivspine ] ) . within the spinal se(3)group we have both se(3)kinematics ( consisting of the spinal se(3)velocity and its two time derivatives : se(3)acceleration and se(3)jerk ) and the spinal se(3)dynamics ( consisting of se(3)momentum and its two time derivatives : se(3)force and se(3)jolt ) , which is the spinal kinematics @xmath2 the spinal mass  inertia distribution .        informally , the _ _",
    "localized spinal se(3)jolt _ _ is a sharp and sudden change in the localized spinal se(3)force acting on the localized spinal mass  inertia distribution .",
    "that is , a ` delta'change in a 3d force  vector coupled to a 3d torque ",
    "vector , striking the certain local point along the vertebral column .",
    "in other words , the localized spinal se(3)jolt is a sudden , sharp and discontinues shock in all 6 coupled dimensions of a local spinal point , within the three cartesian ( @xmath3)translations and the three corresponding euler angles around the cartesian axes : roll , pitch and yaw @xcite .",
    "if the se(3)jolt produces a mild shock to the spine , it causes mild , soft  tissue spinal injury , usually resulting in the back  pain sindrome .",
    "if the se(3)jolt produces a hard shock to the spine , it causes severe , hard  tissue spinal injury , with the total loss of movement .",
    "therefore , we propose a new _ combined loading  rate hypothesis _ of the local spinal injury instead of the old principal loading hypothesis . this new hypothesis has actually been supported by a number of individual studies , both experimental and numerical , as can be seen from the following brief review .",
    "one of the first dynamical studies of the head  neck system s response to impulsive loading was performed in @xcite .",
    "the response of a human head / neck / torso system to shock was investigated in @xcite , using a 3d numerical and physical models ; the results indicated that the head , cervical muscles and disks in the lumbar region were subjected to the greatest _ force changes _ and thus were most likely to be injured .",
    "dependent changes in the lumbar spine s resistance to bending was investigated in @xcite , with the objective to show how time  related factors might affect the risk of back injury ; the results suggested that the risk of bending injury to the lumbar discs and ligaments would depend not only on the loads applied to the spine , but also on _ loading rate_. cyclic loading tests were performed by @xcite to investigate the mechanical responses at different loading rates ; the results indicated that faster _ loading rate _ generated greater stress decay , and disc herniation was more likely to occur under higher loading rate conditions .",
    "anterior shear of spinal motion segments was experimentally investigated in @xcite ; kinematics , kinetics , and resultant injuries were observed ; dynamic loading and flexion of the specimens were found to increase the ultimate load at failure when compared with quasi - static loading and neutral postures .",
    "experimental evidence concerning the distribution of forces and moments acting on the lumbar spine was reviewed in @xcite , pointing out that it was necessary to distribute the overall forces and moments between ( and within ) different spinal structures , because it was the _ concentration of force _ which caused injury , and elicited pain .",
    "small magnitudes of axial torque was shown to in drake05 to alter the failure mechanics of the intervertebral disc and vertebrae in _ combined loading _ situations . a finite element model of head and cervical spine based on the actual geometry of a human cadaver specimen",
    "was developed in @xcite , which predicted the _",
    "nonlinear moment - rotation relationship _ of human cervical spine .",
    "vertebral end - plate fractures as a result of high  rate pressure loading were investigated in @xcite , where a slightly exponential relationship was found between _ peak pressure _ and its _ rate of development_.    the localized spinal se(3)jolt is rigorously defined in terms of differential geometry + @xcite .",
    "briefly , it is the absolute time ",
    "derivative of the covariant force 1form ( or , co - vector field ) applied to the spine at a certain local point . with this respect ,",
    "recall that the fundamental law of biomechanics  the so  called _ covariant force law _",

    "<S> the prediction and prevention of spinal injury is an important aspect of preventive health science . </S>",
    "<S> the spine , or vertebral column , represents a chain of 26 movable vertebral bodies , joint together by transversal viscoelastic intervertebral discs and longitudinal elastic tendons . </S>",

    "<S> localized euclidean jolt _ , or @xmath0jolt , an impulsive loading that strikes a localized spine in several coupled degrees - of - freedom simultaneously . to show this , based on the previously defined _ covariant force law _ , </S>",
    "<S> we formulate the coupled newton  euler dynamics of the local spinal motions and derive from it the corresponding coupled @xmath0jolt dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0jolt is the main cause of two basic forms of spinal injury : ( i ) hard  tissue injury of local translational dislocations ; and ( ii ) soft  tissue injury of local rotational disclinations . </S>",
    "<S> both the spinal _ dislocations and disclinations _ , as caused by the @xmath0jolt , are described using the cosserat multipolar viscoelastic continuum model .    _ </S>",
