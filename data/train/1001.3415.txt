    "the discovery of @xmath13 quasars within the last decade has led to several important advances in our understanding of the high redshift universe .",
    "one area where the impact of this work has been especially significant is the study of the high redshift intergalactic medium ( igm ) with quasar absorption lines .",
    "the forest in particular provides a valuable probe of the ionisation state of the igm ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , the increasing opacity of the igm to photons , culminating in the appearance of the @xcite trough at @xmath13 ( @xcite ) , ultimately limits the utility of the forest at the highest observable redshifts .",
    "this limitation has led many authors to analyse the small regions which exhibit transmission through the forest even at @xmath14 .",
    "these highly ionised proximity zones lie between the quasar emission line and the red - most edge of the gunn - peterson trough , and are due to the enhanced ionisation of hydrogen close to the quasar .",
    "previous analyses have focused on using these regions to examine the ionisation state of the igm with low to moderate resolution spectra ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "these studies have typically modelled the extent and/or shape of the observed transmission to obtain constraints on the igm ionisation state at @xmath16 ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "however , the proximity zones can also be used to probe the _ thermal state _ of the igm at high redshift . high resolution ( @xmath17 )",
    "spectra resolve the thermal broadening kernel , enabling the widths of absorption lines , and hence the temperature of the gas in the proximity zones , to be directly measured ( @xcite ) .",
    "the line widths will be sensitive to any photo - heating caused by the quasar itself ( @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , since the cooling timescale in the low density igm is long , information on the reionisation history _",
    "prior _ to any quasar activity will also be encoded in these absorption lines ( @xcite ) .",
    "earlier measurements of the igm thermal state using the forest at @xmath18 have indeed yielded valuable insights into the epoch of reionisation at @xmath19 ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , given enough time following reionisation , the igm temperature will eventually reach an asymptotic value which depends only on the spectral shape of the ionising background .",
    "information on the earlier igm thermal evolution , and hence the reionisation history at high redshift , will then be effectively erased ( @xcite ) .",
    "consequently , it is desirable to study the thermal state of the igm as close as possible to the reionisation epoch , where the temperature retains a more recent memory of photo - heating ( @xcite ) .",
    "the line widths in proximity zones at @xmath16 thus contain valuable information on the thermal history of the igm at @xmath20 as well as the impact of any photo - heating by the quasar itself on its environment ( @xcite ) .",
    "in this paper we perform an analysis of absorption line widths in the proximity zone of the @xmath1 quasar sdss  j0818@xmath21722 .",
    "we compare high resolution keck / hires data with detailed synthetic spectra constructed using hydrodynamical simulations and line - of - sight radiative transfer to obtain the first direct constraint on the igm temperature around a quasar at @xmath16 . as such , this work represents a first step toward developing a procedure which may be applied to larger data sets at high redshift in the future .",
    "we begin in section 2 by introducing the observational data and numerical simulations we use for our analysis .",
    "we discuss our methodology in section 3 , and examine the systematic uncertainties which may impact on our results in section 4 .",
    "we present our temperature measurement in section 5 . in section 6",
    "we consider the implications of our results for the igm reionisation history around sdss  j0818@xmath21722 before finally concluding in section 7 .",
    "all distances are expressed in comoving units unless otherwise stated .",
    "our temperature measurements are based on a high - resolution spectrum of the @xmath21 quasar sdss  j0818@xmath21722 ( @xcite ) .",
    "keck hires data were taken in february 2006 using the upgraded detector .",
    "we employed a 0.86slit , which produces a resolution of @xmath22 ( fwhm = @xmath23 ) .",
    "the total integration time was 7.5 hours .",
    "the raw data were processed using a custom set of idl routines that includes optimal sky subtraction ( @xcite ) . in order to achieve the highest possible signal - to - noise ( @xmath24 ) ratio ,",
    "the final one - dimensional spectrum was optimally extracted from all exposures simultaneously after relative flux calibrations were applied to remove the blaze functions from individual orders .",
    "this allowed us to efficiently reject cosmic rays and other bad pixels while preserving as many counts from the object as possible .",
    "the final @xmath24 near the emission line was @xmath25 per 2.1  km  s@xmath26 binned pixel .",
    "continuum fitting in the proximity zone region of a @xmath27 quasar is challenging due to the strong absorption present in the blue side of the emission line .",
    "we first divided the combined spectrum by a power - law with @xmath28 , normalised near @xmath29   .",
    "the value of the power - law slope only weakly affects the overall continuum level in the proximity zone .",
    "next we fit a slowly varying spline to the emission line .",
    "the blue side of the line profile was made to roughly mirror the red side , which could be drawn though the unabsorbed continuum .",
    "this produced a generally gaussian shape , which we joined smoothly onto the underlying power - law .",
    "the continuum was set @xmath30 per cent above the tops of the transmission peaks within @xmath31 of the quasar redshift , after which the peaks were allowed to fall further below the continuum .",
    "although the continuum level is obscured by the high levels of absorption , we estimate that our fit is within @xmath32 per cent of the correct value over the wavelength range of interest .",

    "the simulations are specifically designed to resolve the forest at high redshift ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , they employ a relatively small box size to achieve the required mass resolution . in order to assess the effect of box size on our results , we performed two further simulations with identical mass resolution but different box sizes of @xmath33 mpc ( l1 ) and @xmath35 mpc ( l3 ) , respectively . finally , another @xmath33 mpc simulation , l2 , was performed with @xmath36 gas and dark matter particles to provide an additional test of convergence with mass resolution .",
    "the simulations were all started at @xmath37 , with initial conditions generated using the transfer function of @xcite .",
    "the cosmological parameters are @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , consistent with recent studies of the cosmic microwave background ( @xcite ) .",
    "the igm is assumed to be of primordial composition with a helium fraction by mass of @xmath44 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the gravitational softening length was set to @xmath45 of the mean linear interparticle spacing and  with the exception of model w  star formation was included using a simplified prescription which converts all gas particles with overdensity @xmath46 and temperature @xmath47 into collisionless stars .",
    "model w instead uses the multi - phase star formation and feedback model of @xcite .",
    "we use this to explore the impact of strong galactic winds on our results .",
    "the gas in the simulations is assumed to be optically thin and in ionisation equilibrium with a spatially uniform ultraviolet background ( uvb ) .",

    "we use the multi - frequency line - of - sight radiative transfer algorithm described by @xcite and updated in @xcite .",
    "we follow the procedure outlined in @xcite for constructing the initial conditions for our simulations including radiative transfer .",
    "we use a friends - of - friends halo finding algorithm with a linking length of @xmath63 to identify haloes in the hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "we then select the ten most massive haloes in each simulation and extract lines - of - sight in different orientations around them .",
    "the exact halo mass has little impact ; we find it is more important to resolve the igm along the line - of - sight rather than the host halo itself .",
    "we discuss this issue further in section  [ sec : sys ] .",
    "the halo lines - of - sight are then spliced with lines - of - sight drawn at random from the rest of the simulation , resulting in 30 different lines - of - sight @xmath64 mpc in length , all of which start at the location of a halo .    for each line - of - sight",
    "we compute the transfer of ionising radiation through the igm from a quasar which emits @xmath65 photons per second above the ionisation threshold ,    @xmath66    with a generic broken power law spectrum given by    @xmath67    this spectrum has an extreme uv ( euv ) spectral index @xmath68 , consistent with radio quiet quasars at lower redshift ( @xcite ) .",
    "note , however , the exact spectrum and hence ionising luminosity of the quasar is rather uncertain at @xmath1 .",
    "adopting a harder ( softer ) euv spectral index will increase ( decrease ) the ionising luminosity and the amount of photo - heating around the quasar .",
    "we assume @xmath69 for the absolute magnitude of the quasar , corresponding to @xmath70 for our chosen spectrum .",
    "this magnitude corresponds to the @xmath71 obtained for sdss  j0818@xmath21722 ( @xcite ) .",
    "lastly , we use a duration of @xmath72 for the phase when the quasar is optically bright ( @xcite ) .",
    "this parameter is also somewhat uncertain ; we discuss the implications of this in more detail shortly .    in all our rt simulations ,",
    "we initialise the ionisation state of the igm by assuming photo - ionisation equilibrium with a uvb given by    @xmath73    where @xmath74 is the amplitude of the uvb at the ionisation threshold in proper units of @xmath75 .",
    "we adopt a soft , stellar like spectrum and assume and is already highly ionised by @xmath76 ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "there is no evidence to suggest the hydrogen in the igm surrounding sdss  j0818@xmath21722 was significantly neutral prior to the quasar turning on ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion of this point ) .",
    "the exact choice of uvb spectral index at frequencies below the ionisation threshold is unimportant , since the igm temperature is initialised using the hydrodynamical simulations .     from the quasar redshift",
    "are displayed for clarity of presentation .",
    "the dashed line shows the final ( approximate ) power - law temperature - density relation after photo - heating by the quasar , while the dotted line corresponds to the initial igm temperature - density relation ( taken from the hydrodynamical simulation ) before the quasar turned on .",
    "there is significant scatter in the relationship between temperature and density following quasar activity .",
    "the shaded region corresponds to @xmath77 per cent of all pixels with normalised flux @xmath78 in the corresponding proximity zone spectra .",
    "this gives an indication of the densities which transmission in the proximity zone is sensitive to ( see the discussion in section  [ sec : sys2]).,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    however , reionisation , which must be driven by sources with hard ionising spectra , is thought to be delayed until around @xmath19 when the number density of quasars begins to peak ( @xcite ) .",
    "we model this delay by truncating the uvb above the ionisation threshold .",
    "when the quasar turns on in our rt models , its hard ionising spectrum will therefore reionise and photo - heat the in the surrounding igm , resulting in the so - called `` thermal proximity effect '' ( @xcite ) .",
    "the main effect of reionisation by the quasar is to flatten the temperature density relation and boost the temperature at mean density by @xmath79 within the proximity zone .",
    "the volume weighted temperature - density plane from one of our rt simulation sets ( model c ) is displayed in figure  [ fig : trho ] .",
    "the final ( approximate ) temperature - density relation in the rt simulations after photo - heating by the quasar are given in the last two columns of table  [ tab : sims ] .",
    "as already discussed , the exact amount of heating depends on the assumed euv spectral index .",
    "note also that if the quasar lifetime is significantly shorter ( longer ) than the generic value of @xmath72 we have assumed , the extent of the region where is photo - ionised and heated by the quasar will be smaller ( larger ) . in this work we consider the igm within @xmath80 of sdss  j0818@xmath21722 , a scale over which is fully ionised for @xmath81 for our choice of quasar spectrum .",
    "longer quasar lifetimes will make little difference to our results .",
    "however , if @xmath82 our models will overestimate the size of the region ( and hence photo - heating ) around the quasar .",
    "lastly , the amplitude of the uvb at the ionisation edge in eq .",
    "( [ eq : uvb ] ) , @xmath74 , is set using the density dependent model presented in @xcite .",
    "briefly , this model accounts for the bias in the overdense region around the quasar host halo and is computed as a function of the proper time along the trajectory of a photon emitted by the quasar .",
    "this results in an enhanced contribution to the uvb near the quasar host halo relative to the mean igm .",
    "the latter is calibrated to match measurements of the photo - ionisation rate derived from the observed forest opacity at @xmath83 ( @xcite ) .",
    "a detailed description of the model and its application to high redshift forest spectra may be found in @xcite .",
    "note that the uvb amplitude is important for the observed _ size _ of a proximity zone ( @xcite ) , but the precise value of this parameter is not important for the gas temperatures around the quasar we explore in this work .",
    "we follow standard procedure to construct synthetic proximity zone spectra from the output of each of our rt models ( _ e.g _ @xcite ) .",
    "the spectra are then convolved with a gaussian instrument profile with @xmath84 , resampled onto pixels of width @xmath85 and gaussian distributed noise with @xmath86 is added .",
    "these values are chosen to match the observed spectrum of sdss  j0818@xmath21722 . to account for uncertainties in the continuum placement on the observed data ,",
    "we renormalise the synthetic data by the highest flux in @xmath87 segments along each line - of - sight .",
    "although this will not account for continuum uncertainties perfectly , it will approximate the way the continuum is fitted to the real data and should reduce a potential systematic bias .",
    "we consider this issue further in section  [ sec : sys2 ] .",
    "lastly , we rescale the optical depths in each pixel of the synthetic spectra by a constant to match the mean flux of the observed data , @xmath88 , within the range @xmath89 ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "an example spectrum drawn from model c is displayed in figure  [ fig : spectrum ] along with the observed line - of - sight we use in this work , sdss  j0818@xmath21722 .",
    "in this work we use the cumulative probability distribution function ( cpdf ) of the doppler widths of absorption lines , @xmath91 , in the proximity zone as our probe of the igm temperature .",
    "the cpdf has the advantage of fully using the limited data available ( our analysis of sdss  j0818@xmath21722 yields only @xmath92 doppler widths ) and it avoids binning and the associated loss of information .",
    "although the absorption lines will not all be purely thermally broadened ( @xcite ) , all absorption lines will nevertheless be smoothed on a scale associated with the thermal broadening kernel .",
    "the entire cpdf is therefore sensitive to the igm temperature .",
    "however , the lack of a direct relationship between the doppler parameters and temperature means detailed synthetic spectra are crucial for calibrating this statistic .",
    "we obtain the cpdf for both the observed and synthetic data via voigt profile fitting .",
    "we perform the analysis using an automated version of the voigt profile fitting package vpfit.rfc/vpfit.html ] we choose to include lines in the range @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) from the quasar redshift only .",
    "the lower limit is chosen to avoid edge effects in the synthetic data , while beyond @xmath95 it becomes impossible to fit voigt profiles reliably due to the increasing opacity of the igm .",
    "all lines with relative errors in excess of @xmath96 per cent are rejected from our final analysis ( @xcite ) .",
    "this removes most of the very narrow lines which tend to be in blends .",
    "we also discard all lines with doppler parameters @xmath97 and column densities @xmath98 .",
    "broad shallow lines with @xmath97 are almost always added near the continuum level to improve the overall fit , while strong lines with damping wings tend to be added near the edge of the proximity zone where there is very little transmission .",
    "these cuts remove 32 and 25 per cent of identified voigt profiles in the observed and simulated data sets , respectively .",
    "lastly , we note that some ambiguous fits will still remain in our analysis . however , since we treat the observed and synthetic spectra in exactly the same way we expect any potential bias to be small .    the sensitivity of the resulting doppler width cpdf to the gas temperature is demonstrated in the left panel of figure  [ fig : btemp ] , where the cpdfs for four of our rt simulation sets are displayed .",
    "the cpdfs correspond to the data from all 30 lines - of - sight in each rt simulation set .",
    "it is clear the entire cpdf is sensitive to the gas temperature in the proximity zone .",
    "increasing the temperature of the igm shifts the cpdf towards higher b - parameter values , increasing the median doppler parameter .",
    "the median doppler parameters for the models displayed , which span a range of @xmath99 , are @xmath100 .",
    "the observed distribution , which has @xmath101 , is displayed as the thick solid curve in the right panel of figure  [ fig : btemp ] along with the cpdfs for the _ individual _ lines - of - sight in model c. this gives an indication of the scatter in the cpdf from one line - of - sight to the next for the same underlying model .",
    "a two distribution kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test ( @xcite ) using the average ( all 30 lines - of - sight ) and observed cpdfs yields @xmath102 and @xmath103 for models a , c , e and g respectively .",
    "this does not rule out the null hypothesis that the observed cpdf is drawn from the same distribution as models a , c and e.      we now turn to describing the methodology which lies at the heart of our analysis procedure .",
    "we use our synthetic spectra to construct monte carlo realisations of the doppler parameter cpdf for a range of models with different igm temperatures . to quantify the amount of scatter in the simulated cpdfs",
    ", we use a `` d - statistic '' that is very similar to the parameter used in a ks test . for each line - of - sight in a given simulation set ,",
    "the d - statistic is the maximum difference between the doppler parameter cpdf for that line - of - sight and the cpdf for all 30 lines - of - sight , such that    @xmath104    where we preserve the sign of the difference .",
    "the d - statistic cpdf for a model with known temperature @xmath51 , @xmath105 , can then be constructed .",
    "if the d - statistic for an observed line - of - sight , @xmath106 , is known , the d - statistic cpdf may then be used in combination with bayes theorem to infer a confidence interval for the _ observed _ @xmath51 .",
    "the cumulative probability for the observed temperature at mean density @xmath51 given @xmath106 is :    @xmath107    an application of bayes theorem , @xmath108 , then leads to    @xmath109    where @xmath110 is a constant which normalises the total probability to unity and @xmath111 is the prior on @xmath51 . in order to obtain our constraint on @xmath51",
    ", we evaluate the derivative of the d - statistic cpdf derived from our simulations at @xmath106 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tdist ] ) .",
    "we adopt a flat prior , @xmath111 , over the range of temperatures explored in the simulations .",
    "these are set by the combined effect of the initial temperature of the hydrodynamical simulations and the subsequent heat input from photo - heating by the quasar , such that @xmath112 .",
    "this is intended to represent a reasonable range for the igm temperature following and reionisation , and is consistent with temperatures predicted in simulations of reionisation ( @xcite ) .",
    "the main drawback of our method is the computational expense of constructing and analysing synthetic spectra .",
    "we have seven hydrodynamical simulations with different values of @xmath51 , so we may only evaluate @xmath113 at seven discrete points .",
    "we use a cubic spline to interpolate between these to obtain a continuous distribution for integration . with the current method ,",
    "finer sampling of the distribution would require running and analysing additional simulations .",
    "a less expensive approach would be to use a single hydrodynamical simulation and simply impose a range of initial temperature - density relations on the igm .",
    "however , this would decouple the initial gas temperature from the gas hydrodynamics and incorrectly model the effect of pressure ( jeans ) smoothing on the gas distribution ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , there are only 30 line - of - sight in each simulation set , which makes the derivative of the d - statistic cpdf somewhat noisy . this could be remedied by analysing more lines - of - sight ,",
    "although the voigt profile analysis procedure is time consuming .",
    "for this first attempt we have instead elected to perform a easily manageable number of simulations .",
    "we therefore smooth the d - statistic cpdf with a gaussian filter of width @xmath114 before computing its derivative .",
    "we find this to be the optimum smoothing width , and we have verified that alternative choices of @xmath115 and @xmath116 do not significantly alter our final results .",
    "on the other hand , the major advantage of our approach is that it avoids binning the data and is non - parametric .",
    "however , our method implicitly assumes that the synthetic spectra accurately represent the observed data .",
    "if our synthetic models are significantly in error , any temperature constraints will be unreliable .",
    "for this reason , we now turn to consider numerical convergence and some of the possible systematic errors which may affect our analysis .",
    "we first consider the effect of mass resolution and box size on the simulated doppler width cpdf in figure  [ fig : bsysn ] .",
    "the left panel displays the impact of mass resolution on the cpdf , while the right panel indicates the effect of box size .",
    "the cpdf is well converged for our fiducial mass resolution ( @xmath117 ) , although note our lowest resolution model ( l1 , @xmath118 ) does not correctly resolve the line widths .",
    "it is also encouraging that the box size , and hence the amount of large scale power in our simulations , has little effect on the cpdf .",
    "the maximum halo mass in the @xmath35 mpc box is @xmath119 , which is an order of magnitude greater than the largest halo in our fiducial simulation volume of @xmath33 mpc ( @xmath120 ) .",
    "however , this has little effect on the cpdf because we are measuring doppler parameters in the ambient igm rather than in the host environment of the quasar .",
    "note , however , that the maximum halo mass we consider is still smaller than the expected host masses of @xmath121 for bright @xmath16 quasars ( @xcite ) .",
    "we nevertheless find it is much more important to resolve absorption line widths correctly in our models using a high resolution simulation rather than using a larger volume .",
    "we conclude that our simulations are well converged with box size and mass resolution for the purpose of this study ; any differences in the cpdf are small compared to the contrast between models with different temperatures .",
    "the effect of four different systematic uncertainties on the simulated doppler parameter cpdf are displayed in figure  [ fig : bastro ] .",
    "the first we consider is the mean transmitted flux , @xmath122 , where @xmath123 is the optical depth in pixel @xmath124 .",
    "as discussed earlier , when constructing our synthetic spectra we follow a standard procedure and rescale the photo - ionisation rate in post - processing by a fixed constant to produce spectra which match the @xmath125 of the observed data , @xmath126 .",
    "it is therefore important to assess how a different value of @xmath125 may influence the doppler parameter cpdf .",
    "the effect of the mean flux in the region of the spectra where lines are fitted , @xmath127 , is shown in the upper left panel of figure  [ fig : bastro ] .",
    "we perform a voigt profile analysis on two further models which are identical to model c , except from being rescaled in post - processing to have @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "it is clear that the mean flux has little effect on the doppler parameter cpdf , changing the median doppler parameter by less than @xmath130 for the examples shown .",
    "this is expected theoretically ; as pointed out by @xcite , the ionising background does not play a role in setting the _ shape _ of an absorption line  and hence its doppler parameter  around the peak optical depth . note , however , that the mean flux will indeed be important for the line column densities , decreasing @xmath131 at fixed density when the photo - ionisation rate is raised .",
    "we find that uncertainties in the mean flux should not be important for this work .",
    "we reach a similar conclusion regarding the impact of galactic winds on the cpdf in the upper right panel of figure  [ fig : bastro ] .",
    "we have constructed spectra from model w. this uses the multi - phase star formation and winds model of @xcite , but in all other respects is identical to model c. the wind velocity is @xmath132 , which is an extreme model in the sense that it assumes all energy produced by supernovae is converted into kinetic energy .",
    "the differences in the cpdf are again small , with @xmath133 and @xmath134 for the c and w models respectively",
    ".      we do not attempt to measure the density dependence of the igm temperature in this work ; this is difficult to achieve for a single quasar spectrum at @xmath1 .",
    "instead we focus on constraining the temperature at mean density , @xmath51 .",
    "the assumed power - law slope of the temperature - density relation , @xmath60 , is therefore a systematic uncertainty in our analysis .",
    "note again that a single power - law temperature - density relation , @xmath50 , does not provide an accurate description of the igm thermal state in our simulations ( _ e.g. _ figure  [ fig : trho ] , and see also @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , for the present we find it convenient to characterise the relationship between temperature and density as scatter around a power - law .    in the lower left panel of figure  [ fig : bastro ]",
    "we demonstrate the effect of @xmath60 on the doppler parameter cpdf .",
    "model c and model h have @xmath135 and @xmath136 respectively , with almost identical temperatures at mean density .",
    "interestingly , there is very little difference between the cpdfs , with @xmath133 and @xmath137 .",
    "this is the result one would expect if the cpdf is sensitive to gas densities around the cosmic mean at @xmath1 .",
    "we may test if this is the case by evaluating the range of optical depth weighted overdensities , @xmath138 ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) , over the range @xmath139 in our simulated spectra . in figure",

    "is estimated to be 1 - 4 per cent ( @xcite ) . however , towards higher redshift , the increasing opacity of the igm means the transmitted flux recovers to the unabsorbed level less and less frequently .",
    "identifying the continuum level accurately becomes very challenging , with an estimated uncertainty of up to @xmath146 per cent even for the high - quality spectrum considered here .",
    "continuum estimation therefore presents a significant systematic uncertainty in our analysis .",
    "as it is difficult to identify where the continuum lies on the observed data at @xmath16 , our approach in this work is instead to treat the simulated spectra in the same way as the observational data .",

    "although this means we may not correctly identify the `` true '' continuum , in principle this procedure should at least reduce any bias ( see @xcite for similar approaches to this problem at lower redshift )",

    "the maximum correction is around 10 per cent , but it can be up to a 25 per cent for some lines - of - sight at the edge of the proximity zone .",

    "we estimate that metal contamination may then at most systematically _ decrease _ any constraint on the igm temperature in the proximity zone by @xmath158 .",
    "as we shall see , the systematic uncertainties discussed in this section are small compared to the statistical uncertainty for an individual line - of - sight .",
    "consequently , we do not consider these in our final analysis .",
    "however , we note that future analyses with smaller statistical errors will require a more detailed treatment of continuum placement and metal contamination .",
