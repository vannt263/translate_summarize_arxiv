    "low - density parity - check ( ldpc ) convolutional codes @xcite , also known as spatially coupled ldpc ( sc - ldpc ) codes @xcite have received a great deal of attention in the recent years as a result of their excellent performance under iterative decoding . in particular",
    ", it has been shown that the threshold of a belief propagation ( bp ) decoder improves to the threshold of an optimal maximum a - posteriori ( map ) decoder .",
    "this remarkable phenomenon is called threshold saturation .",
    "spatial coupling is not limited to ldpc codes . braided convolutional codes ( bccs ) are a class of spatially coupled ( sc ) codes introduced in @xcite .",
    "recently , the authors introduced spatially coupled turbo codes ( sc - tcs ) @xcite , as the sc counterparts of parallel @xcite and serially @xcite concatenated convolutional codes . in @xcite , we investigated threshold saturation for sc parallel concatenated codes ( sc - pccs ) , sc serially concatenated codes ( sc - sccs ) and bccs over the binary erasure channel ( bec ) .",
    "we derived closed - form density evolution ( de ) equations for sc - tcs and bccs and investigated their decoding thresholds .",
    "our numerical results suggest that threshold saturation occurs for sc - pccs , sc - sccs and bccs .    in this paper , we formally prove threshold saturation for sc - tcs and bccs over the bec .",
    "our proof relies on the proof technique based on potential functions , recently proposed by yedla _",
    "we introduce a compact graph representation to describe pcc , scc and bcc ensembles .",
    "similar to a protograph @xcite , the compact graph makes it easier to illustrate the analysis of the message passing decoding .",
    "we then demonstrate that by few assumptions , the de recursions of sc - tcs @xcite and bccs @xcite , can be rewritten in a form that corresponds to the recursion of a scalar admissible system as in @xcite .",
    "this makes it possible to derive suitable potential functions for tcs and uncoupled bccs .",
    "finally , we prove threshold saturation for sc - tcs and bccs following the same lines as the proof in @xcite for sc - ldpc codes .",
    "it is possible to analyze message passing decoding algorithms in an efficient way by the use of factor graphs @xcite .",
    "however the conventional factor graph of codes with convolutional component codes , such as pccs , sccs and bccs , gets very large as the length of the component codes increases . in this section",
    "we introduce a more compact graph representation , in which each trellis is represented by a single factor node and each collection of variables of the same type is represented by a single variable node .",
