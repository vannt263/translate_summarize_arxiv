    "vibrational spectroscopy is a valuable tool for the characterization of molecular systems .",
    "different techniques  ranging from standard infrared absorption,@xcite to more intricate spectroscopies such as vibrational circular dichroism,@xcite raman,@xcite and raman optical activity@xcite  allow one to record vibrational spectra for a detailed characterization of chemical systems , that span a wide range from molecules of astrochemical interest@xcite to large biomolecules.@xcite in order to decode the detailed information contained in an experimental spectrum of a complex system , simple selection rules based on semi - empirical hamiltonians are insufficient , and _ ab initio _ calculations are required .    computational approaches for the calculation of vibrational properties of molecular systems can be assigned to two main classes , namely variational and perturbative approaches . in variational calculations ,",
    "the vibrational energies and wave functions are obtained by diagonalization of a vibrational hamiltonian in a given basis set such as the harmonic - oscillator eigenfunctions@xcite or eigenfunctions from a vibrational self - consistent field ( vscf ) calculation.@xcite the fraction of vibrational correlation energy that is missing in the vscf mean - field approach can then be captured by vibrational configuration interaction@xcite or vibrational coupled cluster@xcite methods . with variational approaches it is possible to obtain fully converged results for a given hamiltonian by systematically increasing the basis set .",
    "the hamiltonian in turn depends on the electronic potential that is calculated with quantum - chemical _ ab initio _ electronic structure methods and remains the main source of error .",
    "unfortunately , the computational cost of these variational approaches grows exponentially with the size of the system and limits the range of application to rather small molecules ( typically up to ten atoms ) .",
    "perturbative approaches on the other hand , such as the most commonly applied vibrational second - order perturbation theory ( vpt2)@xcite and vibrational mller - plesset perturbation theory,@xcite are computationally more feasible and can be applied to systems with up to 100 atoms . however , although reliable results can be obtained with vpt2 for semi - rigid systems , this approach certainly fails for molecules with shallow potential energy surfaces ( pess ) and corresponding highly anharmonic , large - amplitude modes .",
    "several techniques have been developed and successfully applied to reduce the computational effort of variational approaches .",
    "basis pruning algorithms@xcite were developed with the aim to include only a limited number of basis functions in the variational calculation .",
    "an alternative approach is based on so - called contracted basis techniques , in which basis functions are obtained by diagonalizing sub - blocks of the full hamiltonian , involving only strongly interacting coordinates.@xcite the computational cost of variational calculations can also be reduced with local mode techniques@xcite instead of normal coordinates to reduce the number of off diagonal anharmonic couplings .",
    "a further alternative , whose analog is widely applied in electronic structure theory , but hardly explored in vibrational calculations , is the parameterization of the vibrational wave function in tensor formats , such as canonical decomposition@xcite and matrix product states ( mps ) .",
    "these wave function representations must then be optimized with efficient algorithms such as the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) algorithm@xcite for the optimization of mps wave functions . here",
    ", we develop a dmrg optimization of mps representations for vibrational wave functions and energies .",
    "we denote our approach as vdmrg .",
    "recently , the eigenfunctions of a vibrational hamiltonian were expressed in a tensor train format@xcite , with a discrete variable representation ( dvr ) basis set@xcite . while the tensor train format is algebraically equivalent to the mps format , the optmization protocol proposed in ref .",
    "is very different from the two - site dmrg algorithm chosen for our vdmrg approach .",
    "moreover , our implementation of vdmrg expresses both the wave function and the hamiltonian in tensor format , as an mps and matrix product operator ( mpo ) , respectively .",
    "our paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : theory ] describes the underlying theory of vdmrg .",
    "after this brief description of the computational details of the implementation , the application of vdmrg to several molecules of varying size is discussed .",
    "first , we demonstrate the reliability of vdmrg at the example of a triatomic molecule , clo@xmath0 , for which fully converged variational energies can be easily calculated .",
    "then , two medium - sized molecules ( ch@xmath1cn and c@xmath0h@xmath2 ) are studied in detail . for ch@xmath1cn ,",
    "we chose a quartic pes from density functional theory calculations@xcite and for c@xmath0h@xmath2 a sextic pes from accurate coupled cluster calculations.@xcite results are compared to experimental data.@xcite finally , the vibrational properties of the sarcosyn - glycin dipeptide ( sargly@xmath3 ) are calculated to assess the reliability of vdmrg for large systems , for which standard variational calculations are generally unfeasible .",
    "the vibrational wave function @xmath4 of a molecule in the @xmath5-th vibrational state with @xmath6 degrees of freedom can be expressed by a full configuration interaction ( fci ) expansion , @xmath7 where the occupation number vectors are built from a basis of one - dimensional functions for each vibrational degree of freedom .",
    "whereas for an electronic wave function , due to fermi - dirac statistics , the occupation number of each orbital can not exceed 1 , it is unbounded for a mode in a bosonic vibrational wave function . to limit the size of the basis set in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vci_ansatz ] ) , an upper bound ( @xmath8 ) for the occupation number of each mode has to be defined .",
    "for a total vibrational state @xmath5 expressed in terms of occupation number vectors @xmath9 , the mps @xmath10-body wave function @xmath4 reads @xmath11 expressed in a basis set of @xmath6 one - dimensional basis functions .",
    "the coefficients of the linear expansion in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dmrg_ansatz ] ) are decomposed as products of @xmath6 matrices @xmath12 with maximum dimension @xmath13 ( with the exception of @xmath14 and @xmath15 , which are row and column vectors , respectively , of that dimension ) . by restricting the maximum dimension of the individual matrices @xmath16 to @xmath13 ,",
    "the dmrg algorithm achieves a reduction of the scaling from exponential to polynomial .",
    "this is a significant computational advantage over the fci expansion , where the exponential scaling@xcite limits applications to small systems .",
    "hence , the ci coefficients are encoded in mps form , @xmath17 which is an approximation for finite choices of @xmath13 , which we denote the number of renormalized block states. the product structure of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dmrg_ansatz_vibrations ] ) implies a one - dimensional ordering of the vibrational modes @xmath18 that are now associated with the matrices @xmath16 .",
    "we refer to these modes as _ sites _ and denote the sequence of these sites as a _ lattice _ for consistency with the general dmrg nomenclature .    in vdmrg ,",
    "the matrices @xmath16 are calculated variationally by minimizing the expectation value of the vibrational hamiltonian @xmath19 over the state @xmath4 . in this work , the watson hamiltonian@xcite ,",
    "@xmath20 is applied for the calculation of vibrational energies . here , @xmath21 is the position operator associated with the @xmath18-th normal mode , and @xmath22 is its conjugate momentum . in a fourth - order ( quartic )",
    "taylor expansion of the potential , @xmath23 are the harmonic frequencies and @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the third- and fourth - order reduced force constants , respectively , which can be defined in terms of the third- and fourth - order partial derivatives , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , of the pes , @xmath28 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : watson_hamiltonian ] ) , @xmath29 are the rotational constants and @xmath30 the coriolis coupling constants . as the generalization of eq .",
    "( [ eq : watson_hamiltonian ] ) to support also higher - order terms is straightforward , calculations with fifth- and sixth - order potentials are also presented in this work .    to exploit the dmrg formalism , a second - quantized hamiltonian is required .",
    "the second - quantized form of the vibrational hamiltonian @xmath19 can be obtained by the following substitution : @xmath31 @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the bosonic annihilation and creation operators for the @xmath18-th vibrational mode , obeying the following rules : @xmath35    the second - quantized form of the watson hamiltonian can be obtained by substitution of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : sqoperators_vibrations_1 ] ) and ( [ eq : sqoperators_vibrations_2 ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ eq : watson_hamiltonian ] ) and reads:@xcite .",
    "@xmath36 hence , the third - order potential term , for example , can be written as a sum of all possible products of bosonic creation or annihilation operators localized on sites @xmath18 , @xmath37 , and @xmath5 ( such as @xmath38 ) . a similar result is obtained for the fourth - order potential term , but in this case 16 terms are present . more attention",
    "must be paid to the evaluation of the sign associated to a coriolis term due to the presence of the momentum operator . at variance with the electronic hamiltonian ,",
    "the second - quantized form of the vibrational hamiltonian contains operator strings with different numbers of creation and annihilation operators and , as a consequence , a computational scheme such as dmrg that generates explicit matrix representations of these elementary operators , will face significant challenges that can only be well met by a strictly modular , general , and object - oriented implementation .",
    "an operator @xmath39 can be written as an mpo , @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a compact notation for @xmath42 .",
    "compared to the mps matrices in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dmrg_ansatz_vibrations ] ) , the mpo matrices @xmath43 ( the summation over the @xmath44 indices is equivalent to a matrix - matrix multiplication ) have two superscripts that specify elements of the bra - ket vectors @xmath45 . while the dimension of the mps matrices @xmath16 is adapted to a maximum value during the dmrg optimization , the dimensions of the mpo matrices @xmath43 , and therefore the @xmath44 indices , are fixed for each site by the particular form of the operator encoded in mpo format .",
    "the mpo can now be constructed from matrix representations of the elementary operators @xmath34 and @xmath33 . to understand the formulation of the watson hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : watsonhamiltonian ] ) in mpo format , we write explicitly the construction of the first ( harmonic ) term for mode @xmath18 that we denote @xmath46 : @xmath47 with unit matrices @xmath48 on all sites but @xmath18 . therefore , the construction of the hamiltonian scales with @xmath49 for quartic force fields ( as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : watsonhamiltonian ] ) ) and @xmath50 for sextic force fields in a naive mpo construction .    in the dmrg algorithm",
    ", the mps optimization requires the repeated application of exact diagonalization and singular value decomposition .",
    "this procedure is called a sweep algorithm because the mps site matrices are subsequently optimized from the first to the @xmath6-th site ( one sweep ) before they are optimized in reverse order from the @xmath6-th to the first site ( next sweep ) .",
    "this is an optimization of reduced dimensional basis states contributing to the quantum state in a least - squares sense .",
    "it is a peculiarity of the algorithm that parts of the total vibrational mps wave function , entering the energy expectation value , are not known in the first sweep .",
    "therefore , an initial guess with random numbers as mps entries or an mps solution of an mpo with only harmonic contributions can be applied .",
    "we note that in refs .   and a more general second - quantized form of the vibrational hamiltonian was proposed , where a general one - dimensional basis set is applied for each mode , the eigenfunctions of the harmonic - oscillator hamiltonian being only one specific choice .",
    "although these more general formulations can , in principle , be exploited within vdmrg , they would increase its computational cost significantly .",
    "the reason is that , when a general basis set is employed for each mode , excitations of a mode are represented by different basis functions with one pair of creation and annihilation operators to be introduced for each of these _ basis functions per mode _ , and then the _ total number _ of local elementary operators scales as @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the maximum number of basis functions for each mode .",
    "however , when hermite polynomials are employed as local basis set ( as chosen for this work ) , the number of local elementary operators grows as @xmath6 , because _ one pair _ of creation and annihilation operators is needed for _ each mode _ only .",
    "therefore , a significantly more compact mpo expression of @xmath19 is obtained with a harmonic - oscillator basis set .",
    "with the second - quantized form of the watson hamiltonian , eq .",
    "( [ eq : watsonhamiltonian ] ) , the implementation of the mpo - based dmrg algorithm presented in ref .   can be extended to the calculation of vibrational properties .",
    "we implemented this hamiltonian into our qcmaquis program@xcite that is based on an mps library developed for spin hamiltonians@xcite .",
    "qcmaquis provides an implemention of the full electronic hamiltonian with up to four fermionic elementary creation and annihilitation operators . for the generalization of this implementation",
    ", we needed to 1 ) implement the commutation symmetry of bosonic creation and annihilation operators ( to rplace the anticommutation symmetry of the fermionic creation and annihiliation operators expressed in terms of @xmath53 operators in ref .  ) , 2 ) allow for arbitrary occupations @xmath54 , and implement mpos for sequences of more than four elementary creation and annihilation operators .",
    "all of this was comparatively easy to accommodate by virtue of the modular and object - oriented structure of qcmaquis .    the input data for our vdmrg calculations ( i.e. , harmonic frequencies , anharmonic force constants , coriolis coupling constants ) were either taken from the literature data or , for the dipeptide sargly@xmath3 , calculated with the gaussian program.@xcite detailed information on the electronic structure methods applied for the generation of the pess is specified in the respective sections below .",
    "we emphasize that the variational optimization of the mps provides the anharmonic zero - point vibrational energy ( zpve ) . to also obtain transition frequencies ,",
    "the energy of vibrationally excited states must be determined .",
    "this is accomplished by an optimization in the space orthogonal to the one spanned by the lower - energy vibrational states through an appropriate projection operation as described in ref .  .",
    "transition energies @xmath55 are then calculated as @xmath56",
    "to validate our implementation of vdmrg , we calculated the vibrational states of the triatomic molecule clo@xmath0 in its electronic ground state of x@xmath57 symmetry because an accurate pes obtained from multi - reference configuration interaction ( mrci ) calculations is available in the literature.@xcite fully converged vibrational energies up to 3300  @xmath58 were calculated from this pes with variational approaches.@xcite the high accuracy of these calculated frequencies was demonstrated by comparison to high - resolution experimental data.@xcite these theoretical results@xcite will be our reference in the following to assess the convergence of our vdmrg calculations .    before discussing the results of our calculations ,",
    "we compare the vdmrg approach with the variational approaches of the reference papers . in the study by peterson,@xcite",
    "the pes is expressed as a taylor expansion in terms of the internal coordinates ( the two bond lengths and the bond angle ) of the molecule .",
    "the variational calculations of the vibrational problem are then carried out directly in these coordinates , with morse oscillator eigenfunctions as a basis set for the two stretching coordinates and a dvr for the bond angle.@xcite in a more recent work,@xcite the quartic force field in internal coordinates is first transformed to a sixth - order force field in cartesian normal coordinates , by a direct tensor transformation.@xcite the variational calculation is then carried out in a basis of harmonic - oscillator wave functions . in this work ,",
    "we employ the latter representation of the pes in cartesian normal coordinates , because the second - quantized expression of the vibrational hamiltonian given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : watsonhamiltonian ] ) holds for a basis of harmonic - oscillator wave functions .",
    "the two representations are , in principle , different because internal coordinates are non - linear functions of the cartesian normal modes , but they result in equal fundamental frequencies@xcite and are therefore equivalent close to the equilibrium structure . although more recent results are reported in ref .  , the data reported in ref",
    ".   will serve as our reference , because the authors of ref .",
    "also included overtones and combination bands in their discussion .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the vdmrg fundamental frequencies of sargly@xmath3 in the fingerprint region are collected in table  [ tab : energies_dipeptide ] .",
    "localized vscf ( l - vscf ) from ref .   are given together with gvpt2 results obtained with the same rd potential as the one in the vdmrg calculations .",
    "experimental frequencies from ref .",
    "are included where available .",
    "the convergence of the energies with respect to the number of renormalized block states @xmath13 is similar to that observed for smaller systems as analyzed in the previous sections .",
    "almost fully converged results were obtained already with @xmath59 and corrections below 2  @xmath58 were observed upon increasing @xmath13 to 20 and 40 .     computed from harmonic ( red lines ) and anharmonic vdmrg frequencies ( green lines ) .",
    "the parameters of the vdmrg calculations are @xmath60 and @xmath61 . in all cases ,",
    "harmonic intensities were calculated .",
    "[ fig : ir_dipeptide ] ]    in figure  [ fig : ir_dipeptide ] , the spectrum obtained from vdmrg anharmonic frequencies of sargly@xmath3 with @xmath60 and @xmath61 and harmonic intensities is compared to the experimental spectrum.@xcite as expected , the inclusion of anharmonic effects leads to an overall red shift of the frequencies , providing a considerably better agreement with the experimental data .",
    "this is pronounced for the band at 1147 @xmath58 ( c - o - h bending ) , whose energy is overestimated by approximately 50  @xmath58 with harmonic calculations , whereas it is correctly reproduced by vdmrg .",
    "similarly , the pattern recorded between 1350 and 1450 @xmath58 , that is composed by three nearly equidistant bands with comparable intensity , is reproduced more accurately by vdmrg , whereas two of the three bands have nearly the same energy in the harmonic approximation . therefore , although a potential higher than fourth order is usually required to obtain reliable variational energies , anharmonic variational calculations from a quartic potential considerably improve the description of this system compared to purely harmonic calculations .    these vdmrg calculations on sargly@xmath3 with the largest set of parameters among the ones studied here ( @xmath60 , @xmath61 , 5  sweeps ) took , on average , 17.500 seconds per state ( approximately 4 hours and 48 minutes ) .",
    "this corresponds to an overall computational time of less than four days for the lowest 20 excited states on an intel xeon e5 - 2670 @2.6 ghz with 2x8 central processing units and a 64 gb ram node .",
    "therefore , systems with more than 30 modes can be studied with manageable computational effort .",

    "vdmrg calculations were performed with @xmath60 and @xmath59 .",
    "for c@xmath0h@xmath2 , the full quartic potential from ref .   was used . for sargly@xmath3 , a semi - diagonal quartic b3lyp/6 - 311+g(d , p )",

    "vdmrg energies were calculated with a semi - diagonal quartic b3lyp/6 - 311+g(d , p ) force - field .",
    "data corresponding to modes 36 and 37 are highlighted with a black box .",
    "[ fig : convergence_overall ] ]    as already noted above , an additional factor determining the efficiency of the vdmrg calculation is the iterative optimization algorithm .",
    "in fact , the number of renormalized block states @xmath13 and the dimension of the local basis @xmath62 determine the computational cost of each sweep .",
    "however , in order to make vdmrg applicable to large molecules , the number of sweeps required to reach convergence should be largely independent of the system size .    in figure",
    "[ fig : convergence ] , the energies of the first three vibrational states of sargly@xmath3 ( lower panel ) and c@xmath0h@xmath2 ( upper panel ) are reported as a function of the number of sweeps .",
    "the vdmrg calculations were performed with quartic force - fields ( semi - diagonal for sargly@xmath3 ) with @xmath60 and @xmath59 . for ethylene ,",
    "the convergence of the optimization algorithm is fast , with deviations below 1 @xmath58 from the converged value ( obtained with 10 sweeps ) already within three sweeps for both the ground and the excited states .",
    "the efficiency of the procedure is only slightly lower for sargly@xmath3 , even if , to obtain a ground - state energy with an accuracy within 1  @xmath58 , at least four sweeps are required ( eight for the first excited state ) .    in table s5 of the supporting information",
    ", the previous analysis has been extended to all vibrational energies below 1600 @xmath58 .",
    "a graphical representation of the difference with respect to fully converged results as a function of the number of sweeps is reported in figure  [ fig : convergence_overall ] .",
    "with only two sweeps , most of the vibrational frequencies are converged within 1  @xmath58 , with the exception of only five frequencies . with four sweeps ,",
    "only three frequencies were not converged which demonstrates the efficiency of the optimization procedure also for highly - excited states .",
    "it is interesting to note that the frequencies that need the largest number of sweeps to converge , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , are involved in a darling - dennison 1 - 1 resonance ( as can be tested by performing the test described , for example , in ref .  ) and , as noted above , anharmonic corrections are usually relevant for resonant states .",
    "this indicates once more that the number of sweeps required to reach convergence increases with the magnitude of anharmonic corrections . in order to increase the efficiency of the optimization algorithm in such cases ,",
    "the gvpt2 vibrational states could be exploited as an initial guess of the optimization procedure , but this analysis is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "in this work , we presented the first theoretical formulation and implementation of an mpo - based vibrational dmrg algorithm for the calculation of vibrational properties of molecular systems .",
    "the second - quantized watson hamiltonian was employed with a taylor expansion up to sixth - order of the pes and cartesian normal coordinates as the reference coordinate system .",
    "this hamiltonian was compactly represented as an mpo .",
    "we demonstrated that highly - accurate , converged results can be obtained with vdmrg and a moderate number of renormalized block states .",
    "however , the main advantage of vdmrg lies in the fact that results with an accuracy of 1 - 2 @xmath58 can be obtained with a very low number of renormalized block states also for large systems , with 30 - 40 normal modes , which can not be calculated with standard variational approaches .",
    "therefore , vdmrg is a reliable method for the variational calculation of vibrational energies for large systems .    future work will focus on increasing the efficiency of vdmrg .",
    "first of all , the present implementation supports only the harmonic - oscillator wave functions as a local basis set for the individual modes .",
    "however , it has already been shown for established approaches that other choices of the local basis set may provide a faster convergence of the variational expansion .",
    "for example , basis functions arising from vscf calculations are usually better suited for vci calculations,@xcite and the extension of our vdmrg implementation to support a vscf reference is possible with the second - quantized hamiltonian presented in ref . .",
    "being a one - dimensional algorithm , dmrg is most efficient for hamiltonians with mainly short - range ( or local ) interactions . for this reason , the extension to localized modes,@xcite",
    "possibly curvilinear,@xcite is particularly appealing , especially for large systems.@xcite furthermore , it might be beneficial to place resonant modes close to each other on the dmrg lattice and ordering methods based on quantum entanglement can be of value here .",
    "an adaptation of the basis set size to the entanglement of a given mode with all other modes can additionally help to select a local basis with favorable convergence properties .    in the present work",
    ", vibrational frequencies were assigned to specific molecular vibrations by comparing the energies to reference data or to vpt2 results .",
    "however , this procedure lacks robustness , especially for large systems with pronounced variational corrections . in order to build a more robust assignment algorithm , a sampling procedure already applied in electronic structure calculations to express an mps in terms of a fci basis set could be employed.@xcite    finally , the full hamiltonian is included in the variational treatment so far . however , it has been shown@xcite that more efficient approaches can be devised , where only some terms of the hamiltonian are included in the variational treatment , and the remaining terms are treated perturbatively .",
    "the coupling of the vdmrg approach presented here with a perturbative treatment is possible in analogy to approaches already proposed for electronic structure methods@xcite and would reduce the size of the hamiltonian that is treated variationally , and consequently also the computational cost .",

    "<S> variational approaches for the calculation of vibrational wave functions and energies are a natural route to obtain highly accurate results with controllable errors . </S>",

    "<S> , we demonstrate how the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) can be exploited to optimize vibrational wave functions ( vdmrg ) expressed as matrix product states . </S>",
    "<S> we study the convergence of these calculations with respect to the size of the local basis of each mode , the number of renormalized block states , and the number of dmrg sweeps required . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate the high accuracy achieved by vdmrg for small molecules that were intensively studied in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> we then proceed to show that the complete fingerprint region of the sarcosyn - glycin dipeptide can be calculated with vdmrg . </S>"
