    "the close interplay between theory and experiments has always led to fundamental discoveries in condensed matter physics .",
    "this is particularly evident in the search for topological states of matter , starting in the 80 s with the experimental observation of the integer quantum hall ( qh ) effect @xcite , characterized by chiral metallic edge states and insulating bulk states .",
    "few years later , also fractional plateau of the conductance were discovered @xcite , theoretically explained by laughlin as a manifestation of the fractional qh effect @xcite .",
    "after the first theoretical proposal for realizing topological states of matter in the absence of magnetic fields @xcite , bernevig _ et al .",
    "_ suggested that hgte / cdte quantum wells behave as a topological insulator ( ti ) @xcite . realizing the quantum spin hall ( qsh ) effect in the presence of time reversal ( tr ) symmetry @xcite .",
    "soon after the group of molenkamp provided the first experimental report @xcite , showing that nonlocal transport is due to protected helical edge states @xcite , with spin and momentum bound to each other @xcite . with this picture in mind , it is natural to wonder how long the experimental realization of fractional tis , recently proposed by levin and stern @xcite , will take . at the simple intuitive level , fractional tis can be thought as a superposition of two copies of fractional qh states in opposite magnetic fields , with the emergence of tr protected helical edge states with fractional excitations . beyond the emergence of fractional qsh effect in the flat - band lattice models",
    "@xcite , possible experimental realization of such a state have been proposed , ranging from a fractional qh state with a varying @xmath0-factor in the presence of a thin insulating barrier to electron - hole bilayers realized in electron - hole symmetric systems @xcite . + it is thus important to find possible strategies and experimental signatures to identify this novel topological state of matter , which could be exploited also for quantum computing @xcite .",
    "a breakthrough in this direction has been done recently by beri and cooper @xcite , who demonstrated a surprising robustness of fractional tis to magnetic perturbations , which is completely unexpected in integer tis . based on the works carried out in fractional qh systems and integer tis @xcite",
    ", they also showed peculiar transport properties when electrons tunnel through a quantum point contact ( qpc ) , which could be used to probe fractional tis @xcite .",
    "+ in this context , we propose tunneling through a time dependent qpc , realized , for example , by applying time modulated gate voltages , to probe fractional tis . in the case of a static qpc , backscattering at the constriction always decreases the total current , and information about the tunneling processes are encoded in the power - law exponents as a function of bias and temperature .",
    "however , the power laws are often hardly detectable and hidden by several additional mechanisms . here",
    ", we propose a different and more robust method in order to discriminate between fractional and integer tis .",
    "we demonstrate that in fractional tis a time dependent qpc enhances the current , contrary to the decreasing induced in integer tis for not too strong interactions .",
    "this peculiar effect is strictly associated with quasiparticle tunneling , and provides a simple tool to identify fractional tis .",
    "this method takes advantage from the resolving power of finite frequency transport properties in the simple framework of dc current measurements .",
    "different tunneling processes are present , involving one or more excitations depending on the strength of interactions ; we show that the proposed setup also provides a simple way to discriminate between these different processes , without requiring the knowledge of the detailed form of the current .",

    "the smallest scaling dimension in eq . identifies the dominant tunneling process .",
    "in particular one finds that single quasiparticle tunneling ( @xmath92 ) dominates at weak interactions @xmath93 , with @xmath94 . at stronger interactions @xmath95 the charge process ( @xmath96 ) dominates . in any case , for a static qpc , both processes always reduce the total current ( @xmath97 for @xmath98 ) , as can be argued @xcite from eq . .",
    "+ however , when an ac modulated ( @xmath99 ) qpc is considered , the backscattering contributions are no longer driven by the bias only , but the time dependent constriction comes into play .",

    "we find that the current is driven by two effective channels @xcite with voltages @xmath101 , and the sign of @xmath102 now depends on how the two terms in eq .",
    "even if there is only one time dependent parameter ( the tunneling amplitude ) , the backscattering current has been interpreted @xcite as originated from a pumping mechanism , since the effect of gauging out the bias voltages is to give rise to the additional time dependent parameter necessary to generate a pumping current . in this case , it is no longer obvious that the constriction leads to a decreasing of the current , but the time dependent qpc may be able to pump a current in the forward direction , leading to a global current enhancement @xcite . at low temperatures ,",

    "( a ) the single quasiparticle contribution enhances the total current at weak interactions for @xmath113 , while ( b ) the charge contribution enhances the total current at stronger interactions for @xmath114.,width=302 ]     + let us consider fractional tis , and study whether the current is enhanced or decreased by the time dependent constriction .",
    "positive values of @xmath102 correspond to an enhancement of the current more than the universal value @xmath53 ( remember we are focusing on @xmath98 ) . at weak interactions @xmath93 the dominant contribution",
    "is the single quasiparticle tunneling with scaling dimension @xmath115 ( see eq . ) . in this regime @xmath116 and",
    "the current is enhanced for @xmath117 ( fig . [ fig4b](a ) ) .",
    "the single quasiparticle process decreases the current for stronger interactions @xmath118 ( red curve in fig .",
    "[ fig4b ] ) ; however , in this regime tunneling is dominated by the charge process , which leads to enhancement already at moderate interactions @xmath119 for @xmath120 , as shown in fig . [",
    "fig4b](b ) .",
    "it is worth noticing that at the crossover @xmath121 both the single quasiparticle and charge processes contribute to enhance the current .",
    "we thus expect a _ global enhancement _ of the current in fractional tis in the presence of a time dependent constriction , due either to single quasiparticle ( for weak interaction ) or to charge tunneling ( for strong interaction ) .",
    "+ let us now compare this scenario with the one obtained for an integer ti , where only electrons can tunnel . from eq .",
    "we find that single electron tunneling , which dominates at weak interactions @xmath93 , always decreases the current . at stronger interactions",
    "@xmath95 charge tunneling dominates , which however still leads to a decreasing as long as @xmath122 .",
    "+ we then conclude that , if interactions are not too strong @xmath122 , the enhancement of the current in the presence of an ac modulated qpc is a peculiar feature of fractional tis .",
    "+ other signatures can help to discriminate fractional tis also for @xmath123 .",
    "indeed , it is worth noticing that , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4b ] , a transition of @xmath102 from positive to negative values is expected around @xmath124 , and thus depends on the backscattering process through the backscattered charge @xmath125 . since @xmath76 and @xmath75 can be externally controlled , one should be able to extract information about the backscattered charge , and thus on the fractional or integer nature of the system , simply by varying the bias .",
    "in particular , by observing whether the current displays a transition around @xmath126 or @xmath127 , one could also discriminate between single - particle and multi - particle tunneling .",
    "in other words , the position of the transition in the backscattering current has the power to resolve the presence of different fractional excitations . in this perspective",
    ", this quantity has similarities with the photo - assisted differential conductance or finite frequency noise @xcite , since they are similarly affected by the scaling dimensions and by the josephson resonances of the tunneling excitations .",
    "+ furthermore , the current enhancement represents a signature of quasiparticle ( and _ not _ electron ) tunneling . indeed , evaluating the tunneling contribution of electrons ( despite not the dominant process )",
    "would essentially result in replacing @xmath128 and @xmath129 in eqs . and",
    "and one can conclude that both single and double electron tunneling decrease the current for not too strong interactions ( as long as @xmath130 ) .",
    "+ we have thus proposed a simple strategy to identify quasiparticle tunneling in fractional tis .",
    "this method could complement other peculiar responses , such as the quantized conductance , the stability to tr breaking perturbations or the power - law behavior of the backscattering current .",
    "however we stress that , to identify quasiparticle tunneling , one does not need to study the details of the current ( like for example for extracting the exponents of the power laws @xcite ) , but the enhancement of the current in the presence of a time dependent qpc provides by itself a powerful signature of the presence of a fractional ti . for strong interactions",
    "@xmath123 , the current is enhanced both in fractional and in integer tis ; however , the transition from positive to negative values depends on the backscattered charge , allowing to discriminate between fractional and integer excitations .",
    "so we can conclude that the proposed protocol is stable against electron interactions .",
    "+ before concluding , we briefly comment on a different bias voltage configuration , that is the so called spin configuration , with @xmath131 and @xmath132 , corresponding to the presence of a bias voltage between the upper ( at voltage @xmath133 ) and the lower edge ( at voltage @xmath134 ) . here a net charge tunneling current flows across the constriction from one edge to the other , arising from a single quasiparticle tunneling contribution , given by eq . with @xmath135 , and a spin tunneling contribution , given by eq . with @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "the dominant contribution is the single quasiparticle one with scaling dimension @xmath115 . in the presence of a static qpc the tunneling current always flows from positive to negative voltage , as expected .",
    "however , when considering a time dependent qpc in fractional tis the tunneling current may reverse its direction , flowing _ against _ the bias .",
    "this anomalous response , which is expected to occur as long as interactions are not too strong ( @xmath137 ) , represents another peculiar feature of fractional tis with respect to their integer version , where it is not expected to occur at all .",
    "we showed that an enhancement of the current is expected for a fractional topological insulator with a time dependent constriction , allowing for quasiparticle tunneling from one edge to the other .",
    "this effect is not expected to occur neither in integer topological insulators ( for not too strong interactions ) nor in fractional topological insulators when electrons ( and not quasiparticles ) tunnel through the constriction , and thus represents an important tool to identify fractional quasiparticles .",
    "this simple method allows to unambiguously identify fractional topological insulators without requiring the knowledge of the detailed form of the current ( like for example for extracting the power law exponents ) .",
    "furthermore we showed that this effect is robust against electron interaction , and discussed how one can discriminate between single and multi particle processes .",
