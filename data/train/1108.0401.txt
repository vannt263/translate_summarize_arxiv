    "dwarf galaxies are the most abundant type of galaxy in the local universe @xcite and are the closest analogues to the building blocks for galaxy formation at high redshift in @xmath6cdm models ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , in the `` downsizing '' paradigm @xcite dwarf galaxies increasingly dominate the star  forming universe over time @xcite , with star formation ( sf ) perhaps being particularly enhanced within dwarfs over the past 2 gyr @xcite .",
    "stellar winds and supernova explosions of the most massive stars can easily lead to outflows due to their weak gravitational potential .",
    "this implies that not only does the metallicity of the interstellar medium increase with cosmic time , but additionally the intergalactic medium becomes enriched at an early stage @xcite .",
    "moreover , dwarf galaxies are supposed to have played a fundamental role in amplifying magnetic fields in the early universe through outflowing plasma escaping from star  forming regions @xcite .",
    "cosmic rays play an important role in galactic outflows , as they consist of relativistic particles that do not quickly lose their energy , like the hot gas .",
    "they spiral along magnetic field lines emitting highly linearly polarized , non  thermal ( synchrotron ) emission providing a useful tool to study magnetic field structure .",
    "this magnetic field influences how cosmic rays propagate .",
    "for example , nearby edge  on galaxies with radio haloes show a characteristic `` pinched at the waist '' structure in polarised emission ( and sometimes even in total intensity ) which is a consequence of an x  shaped magnetic field ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ".    resolved radio continuum studies of dwarf galaxies have been lacking thus far , because the objects are intrinsically faint .",
    "@xcite took advantage of the excellent sensitivity of the 100m effelsberg telescope to study ic10 in the radio continuum , both in total intensity and polarimetry .",
    "they found extended , diffuse emission coinciding with h@xmath1 emission , and polarized emission close to the non  thermal bubble described by @xcite .",
    "however , they were limited by their coarse resolution ( @xmath7 ) that prevents any detailed comparison with ancillary data . a higher resolution",
    "preliminary vla map at 6 cm was published by @xcite .",
    "@xcite , using the vla , found in ngc4449 despite its weak rotation a surprisingly regular magnetic field showing hints of spiral structure and `` fans '' possibly connected to outflows .",
    "@xcite , again using the vla , studied the starburst dwarf ngc1569 which has a strong radial field , likely shaped by the outflowing gas .    with the new capabilities of the expanded very large array ( evla ) and much improved sensitivity we can study the weak extended emission in dwarf galaxies . in this letter we present first results from observations of ic10 with the evla at c  band , using the full 2ghz of bandwidth that was available at the time of observation .",
    "additional observations at l , x , and ka  band , along with a full interpretation of the data will be published in a forthcoming paper .",
    "ic10 is a perfect candidate for an in depth study of a dwarf galaxy at radio continuum wavelengths because it is relatively bright and nearby , being a member of the local group @xcite .",
    "it has a high star formation rate and a high density of wolf  rayet stars and is regarded to be in a starburst phase @xcite .",
    "the aftermath of massive star formation leaves its imprint on the ism in the form of expanding bubbles and shells that can be traced in and h@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite found holes in and h@xmath1 emission with large filaments in h@xmath1 extending up to a few hundred parsec away from the main body @xcite , suggesting outflows .",
    "the emission is asymmetric with respect to the major axis .",
    "a feature visible in velocity maps suggests ongoing accretion of neutral hydrogen in the outer parts of the galaxy . there is a detection of diffuse hot x  ray emitting gas in this galaxy that is aligned with the main stellar bar @xcite .",
    "@xcite found a region with high radio continuum brightness and identified it as a non  thermal bubble prior to the break out .",
    "@xcite speculated that it could be generated by a hypernova rather than by a collection of supernovae .",
    "as ic10 is close to the galactic midplane ( @xmath8 ) , estimates of its distance are uncertain due to the unknown level of absorption . here",
    ", we use a conservative distance of @xmath9 in line with the most recent results that indicate a likely distance at best slightly less than 1mpc @xcite .",
    "we observed ic10 with the nrao evla under the resident shared risk program ( rsro ; project i d : ah1006 ) .",
    "our observations were taken in d - configuration on august 16 , 2010 .",
    "we used 2 ifs each consisting of 8 sub  bands with a bandwidth of 128mhz each . the sub ",
    "bands contain 64 channels at 2mhz resolution resulting in a total bandwidth of 2ghz .",
    "we placed our ifs between @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "we observed for 4h to ensure good @xmath12coverage and sensitivity to extended emission .",
    "every 15min we observed a phase calibrator ( j0102 + 5824 ) ; we used 3c48 as our flux density ( primary ) calibrator , adopting the @xcite flux scale . in order to measure the polarization leakage ( d  terms ) we observed the unpolarized source 3c84 .",
    "the polarization angle was calibrated using 3c48 .",
    "we calibrated the data with the common astronomy software applications package ( casa ) as outlined in the continuum tutorial of 3c391 on the casa homepage . in all subbands , leakages of @xmath13 before calibration were reduced to 0.2% ( variation across channels ) after calibration .",
    "r - l polarization angles varied by @xmath14 with a constant slope across channels before calibration , and went down to @xmath15 variations across channels after calibration .",
    "we constructed stokes @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 images using the multi ",
    "scale clean algorithm @xcite in casa that models extended emission accurately , but assumes a flat sky  spectrum . in stokes",
    "@xmath16 the integrated flux density was @xmath19 , with a peak brightness of @xmath20 .",
    "the integrated polarized intensity is @xmath21 with peak brightness of @xmath22jy and @xmath23jy in stokes @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "the target rms noise calculated for this observation with @xmath243 hours on  source was @xmath25 .",
    "the rms noise in the stokes @xmath17 and @xmath18 images was @xmath26 , but the stokes @xmath16 image was affected by deconvolution errors at the @xmath27 level .",
    "these errors were at the expected level for continuum imaging when ignoring spectral structure ( average dynamic range @xmath24300 for a spectral index of @xmath3 across a 50% bandwidth , @xmath28 ) .",
    "stokes @xmath16 imaging was repeated with the multi ",
    "scale multi ",
    "frequency synthesis ( ms  mfs ) algorithm @xcite which simultaneously solves for spatial and spectral structure during wide  band image reconstruction , and reached an rms noise of @xmath29 .",
    "this wide - band model was then used to perform one round of amplitude and phase self  calibration , and the resulting image ( shown in greyscale in fig.[fig : i ] ) achieved the rms noise of @xmath26 only 20% higher than the theoretically expected level .",
    "we note that the rms is identical for stokes @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , so that we are not dominated by the signal  to  noise ratio in stokes @xmath16 ; the self  calibration is sufficiently accurate .",
    "a radio spectral index image was produced by ms  mfs as well , and a post  deconvolution wide  band primary beam correction was applied to remove the effect of the frequency  dependent primary beam .",
    "one of the goals of this rsro project was to test the accuracy of this approach .",
    "therefore , this spectral index map was compared with a low  resolution spectral index map constructed within aips from primary  beam corrected stokes @xmath16 images at each sub  band and smoothed to the resolution of the lowest sub  band .",
    "the results agreed , confirming that for this source , wide  band imaging via ms ",
    "mfs followed by a post  deconvolution primary beam correction was able to recover the same spectral information as traditional methods , but at a much improved angular resolution .",
    "the stokes @xmath17 and @xmath18 images were taken into aips , and maps of the polarized intensity were constructed using @xmath30 with option @xmath31 that applies a correction to the noise bias .",
    "we also created the maps of the polarization angle in comb using the option @xmath32 .",
    "we rotate the polarization by @xmath33 to show the orientation of the magnetic field , where we neglect any contribution of faraday rotation .",
    "we tested whether the structure of stokes @xmath17 and @xmath18 changed with frequency by making images for the 16 individual sub  bands and found the change to be small , indicating negligible faraday rotation within our frequency range .",
    "we calculated the degree of polarization and found values between @xmath34 .",
    "these values are at least a factor of 5 larger than what we would expect from instrumental polarization which is around @xmath35 for the vla beam @xcite .",
    "this was further checked by us as we carried out separate test observations with 3c84 at the half ",
    "power point in c  band and found values there of at most 3% .",
    "however , because of beam smearing and the fact that our source lies well within the half  power point , we expect instrumental polarization to be considerably smaller .",
    "we therefore conclude that our measured polarization is dominated by the intrinsic polarization of our source .",
    "figure[fig : i ] shows our total power continuum radio map at 6 cm with a resolution of @xmath36 .",
    "contours start at 3 @xmath37 the rms noise level and increase by a factor of about 2 with every further contour .",
    "we choose a logarithmic grey scale to show the noise floor that is evenly distributed over the full extent of the map . to our knowledge",
    "this is the deepest radio continuum map of a dwarf galaxy yet made , going deeper than the preliminary vla map , also at 6 cm , published by @xcite which reaches a noise of 9@xmath38jy ( chyy , priv .",
    "the deep vla map of ngc1569 at 6 cm by @xcite has an rms noise of @xmath39 but at a smaller beam size of @xmath40 and is much less sensitive to extended emission .",
    "although there are no artefacts visible in the figure that could be ascribed to missing short spacings , it can not be ruled out that we miss low ",
    "level , extended emission .",
    "we find a total flux of 131mjy whereas we expect , based on interpolating single dish observations at 10.45ghz and 2.64ghz @xcite 190mjy .",
    "we could thus be missing up to 30% in total power .",
    "we compare in fig.[fig : ha ] the radio continuum emission with a deep h@xmath1 map of @xcite .",
    "the h@xmath1 is shown as a logarithmic grey ",
    "scale map to enhance weak emission features away from the main stellar body .",
    "the radio and h@xmath1 emission follow each other closely .",
    "the radio continuum peaks at the location of the h@xmath1 emission maxima that trace complexes .",
    "moreover , thanks to the exquisite dynamic range , we can compare the radio emission with extended h@xmath1 emission , including various shells and filaments .",
    "the large filament in the west with a length of @xmath41 is the most prominent feature but we are sensitive enough to also detect the much weaker filaments in the eastern half",
    ". the most prominent hole in the radio continuum is found at ra = @xmath42 , dec = @xmath43 and is fully contained , both in h@xmath1 and radio .",
    "it was identified by @xcite to be the most prominent hole in emission with hints of expansion .",
    "the close correlation between the radio continuum and h@xmath1 emission suggests a large fraction of thermal radio emission from free  free emission .",
    "this is borne out by the radio spectral index map presented in fig.[fig : spix ] .",
    "the thermal emission has a radio spectral index of @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) , whereas the non  thermal synchrotron emission has a spectral index of @xmath3 ( provided the cosmic ray electrons are young , otherwise the spectrum is yet steeper ) .",
    "we find that almost all compact resolved sources within the galaxy have a flat spectral index between @xmath46 and @xmath47 indicative of a dominant thermal component .",
    "these are the compact regions with intense star formation visible in h@xmath1 emission .",
    "we note that our radio spectral index map obtained via ms ",
    "mfs has a better resolution than that obtained with the conventional method , where the resolution is limited by the low frequency map .",
    "this allows us to reliably identify the compact sources in the radio spectral index map that otherwise would be confused in the lower resolution version .",
    "away from the regions the radio spectral index steepens to values between @xmath3 and @xmath48 .",
    "this can only be explained with a non  thermal synchrotron component .",
    "also , this requires synchrotron and inverse compton losses to be important for the cosmic  ray electrons as the radio spectral index is significantly steeper than @xmath3 , the value expected for young cosmic  ray electrons that have been accelerated in supernova shock waves .",
    "this result is surprising as cosmic rays in starburst dwarf galaxies are supposed to be advected in the outflow and their residence time would be short compared to their cooling time .",
    "the radio spectral index steepens even more dramatically at the south  eastern edge ( ra = @xmath49 , dec = @xmath50 ) where the superbubble of @xcite resides .",
    "there the values are between @xmath48 and @xmath51 indicating dominating synchrotron and inverse compton losses .",
    "the map of the structure of the regular magnetic field is presented in fig.[fig : ha_b - vec ] .",
    "we show the orientation of the large  scale magnetic field as measured from the linear polarization , where the length of the vectors is proportional to the polarized intensity .",
    "the degree of polarization in this region is @xmath5 indicating a significant ordered magnetic field component possibly enhanced by compression by the expanding superbubble .",
    "the magnetic field orientation is approximately ne-sw , where the polarized emission extends to the southern tip of the galaxy .",
    "we also detect a magnetic field at the location of the two brightest regions in the southeastern part . at this position , away from the superbubble , the magnetic field orientation is more aligned with the stellar body .",
    "we can not decide , based on the current data , if the magnetic field traverses the regions , because the field could also lie in front of or behind them , in a thick gas layer as is expected for dwarf galaxies . at this resolution",
    "we do not detect a magnetic field that extends the full extent of the galaxy .",
    "we note that the location of our polarized intensity and the orientation of the magnetic field agrees well with that measured with the 100m effelsberg telescope @xcite and the map of @xcite , lending confidence to the performance of the evla and the casa data reduction package .",
    "we compared the flux densities of the radio emission and h@xmath1 emission averaged in @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) boxes .",
    "the radio and h@xmath1 maps were convolved with a gaussian to a hpbw of @xmath54 prior to averaging .",
    "the result is presented in fig.[fig : flux ] .",
    "the h@xmath1 map was corrected for foreground absorption using @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "we clipped the radio data below @xmath56 @xmath37 the rms noise level , to ensure we only use reliable data points and to moderate the influence of missing flux density on our interferometric observations . a power law fit in the double logarithmic plot results in a power law index of @xmath57 and is therefore consistent with a strictly linear relation between the two variables .",
    "the dashed line shows the relation if the radio flux density were purely thermal free  free emission calculated from the h@xmath1 flux density ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* eq.3 ) , assuming an electron temperature of @xmath58 .",
    "the thermal flux density alone is a factor 2 lower than the measured radio flux density .",
    "this is consistent with a thermal fraction of 50% in this galaxy as indicated by the flat radio spectral index .",
    "the linear relation between the radio and the h@xmath1 brightness means that we can use both equally well as star formation tracers .",
    "the star formation rate ( sfr ) from the radio continuum is given by @xcite and can be converted to a star formation rate density .",
    "if we convert the h@xmath1 emission into a star formation rate by the relation given in @xcite , we can compare the two measurements .",
    "the radio star formation rate is a factor of 3 lower than that implied by h@xmath1 .",
    "this means that ic10 lies beneath the radio  sfr correlation and is radio dim .",
    "further studies are required to investigate how this corresponds to the thermal and non  thermal fraction of the radio emission .",
    "in theory we expect that the high frequency observations are a better tracer for the thermal component , especially since they require no correction for internal or foreground extinction .",
    "one goal of this project is to establish how well we can use radio emission as star formation tracer even in such extreme cases as starburst dwarf galaxies .",
    "@xcite found that the molecular depletion time is short in ic10 and that the inferred sfrs are too high for the molecular gas content .",
    "this may be explained by a starburst although it is not clear how much gas is hidden and not traced by the co sub ",
    "mm rotational lines @xcite .",
    "as in many dwarf galaxies the knowledge of the molecular gas content is still sparse , the development of an alternative sfr tracer becomes even more important than for normal spiral galaxies .",
    "the magnetic field structure in this galaxy lacks a strong large ",
    "scale component that would be apparent in radio continuum polarization .",
    "this fits the expectation that the standard @xmath59-dynamo needs shear to operate as near ",
    "solid body rotation will provide only weak amplification ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "such conditions favour studies of local magnetic field amplification mechanisms that are normally difficult to observe in spiral galaxies , as in these systems shear  enhanced disk magnetic fields dominate .",
    "the non  thermal superbubble in ic10 offers the possibility to study what role cosmic rays and magnetic fields play in the disk  halo interface in porous interstellar medium conditions .",
    "state of the art mhd simulations by @xcite suggest that the magnetic field gets swept up in the walls of the shells but can not prevent a superbubble break  out .",
    "eventually the full set of observations will allow us to get a handle on the energetics of the superbubble and put these models to the test .",
