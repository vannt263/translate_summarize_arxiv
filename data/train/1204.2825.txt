    "the form of the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) and the response of dark matter haloes to galaxy formation are two fundamental unknowns , which are important in many areas of astrophysics .",
    "for example , the imf is needed in order to convert observations of integrated stellar light into stellar masses and star formation rates ( two fundamental parameters in galaxy evolution studies ) , and for modelling the supernova rates , chemical evolution , and production of ionizing photons in galaxies .",
    "the response of dark matter haloes to galaxy formation is needed in order to constrain the nature of dark matter from observations of the structure of dark matter haloes ( e.g. , central density slopes , central densities ) and indirect dark matter detection experiments .",
    "halo response also plays a key role in determining the fundamental scaling relations between velocity and light of galaxies ( faber & jackson 1976 , tully & fisher 1977 ) .    for many years the imf and dark halo response",
    "were thought to be universal : the imfs of external galaxies are the same as measured in the milky way ( kroupa 2001 , chabrier 2003 ) ; and dark matter haloes contract adiabatically in response to galaxy formation ( blumenthal 1986 ; gnedin 2004 ) .",
    "however , recent observations and numerical simulations have cast doubt on these assumptions .",
    "we note that while there have been claims of observational evidence for dark halo contraction in early - type galaxies ( e.g. , schulz 2010 ; napolitano 2010 ; trujillo - gomez 2011 ; chae 2012 ) these conclusions depend ( trivially ) on the assumption of a universal milky way type imf ( e.g. , dutton 2011a ) .",
    "it has been known for many years that baryonic effects can , in principle , result in reduced halo contraction or even halo expansion ( e.g. , navarro , eke , & frenk 1996 ; el - zant 2001 ) .",
    "but only recently have these effects been demonstrated in fully cosmological simulations of galaxy formation ( johansson 2009 ; abadi 2010 ; duffy 2010 ; governato 2010 ; macci 2012 ; martizzi 2012 ) .",
    "although some authors still maintain that dark halo contraction is an unavoidable consequence of galaxy formation in cosmologies ( e.g. , gnedin 2011 ) .    the traditional route to constraining the imf is through direct star counts .",
    "in the milky way this has shown the imf to have a power - law shape @xmath14 , with @xmath15 at masses above @xmath16 ( salpeter 1955 ) , and a turn over at lower masses ( kroupa 2001 ; chabrier 2003 ) .",
    "since most of the mass is in low - mass stars , kroupa / chabrier imfs have lower stellar mass - to - light ratios ( by about 0.20 to 0.25 dex ) than a salpeter imf .",
    "outside of our galaxy , counting individual stars is usually not feasible ( especially down to the low masses required to fully constrain the imf ) .",
    "there are several approaches which can be used to probe the imf at different mass scales in extragalactic systems .",
    "constraints on the shape of the imf at high masses typically involve measurements of h@xmath17 and/or far ultraviolet ( fuv ) fluxes .",
    "for example , the equivalent width of h@xmath17 can constrain the slope of the imf above @xmath18 ( kennicutt 1983 , hoversten & glazebrook 2008 ) , and the ratio between h@xmath17 and fuv fluxes probes the imf above @xmath19 ( meurer 2009 ; lee 2009 ) . broadly speaking these methods",
    "show that the high mass imf in external galaxies is similar to that of the milky way , but there are systematic discrepancies which could be explained by variation in the slope and/or upper mass limit of the imf",
    ". note that while modest changes in the upper end of the imf do nt impact the stellar mass - to - light ratios of old stellar populations , top heavy imfs can leave behind enough stellar remnants to significantly increase stellar mass - to - light ratios .",
    "the low mass end ( below @xmath18 ) of the imf can be probed by comparing the mass ( or an upper limit ) of all the stars from dynamics and/or strong gravitational lensing to the stellar mass obtained from stellar population synthesis ( sps ) models .",
    "such studies require imfs lighter ( i.e. , lower stellar mass - to - light ratios ) than salpeter in spiral galaxies ( bell & de jong 2001 ; bershady 2011 ; dutton 2011a , barnab 2012 ; brewer 2012 ) , but are consistent with a universal milky way type imf",
    ".    in elliptical and lenticular galaxies , cappellari ( 2006 ) showed that a salpeter imf over - predicts the dynamical mass - to - light ratios of some `` fast - rotating '' galaxies .",
    "using dynamics and strong gravitational lensing from the slacs survey ( bolton 2006 ) treu ( 2010 ) showed that in fact a salpeter imf is allowed in massive ( stellar mass @xmath20 , velocity dispersion @xmath21 ) elliptical galaxies , even accounting for `` standard '' dark matter haloes . extending this study to include constraints from weak lensing",
    ", predictions from , and the possibility of dark halo contraction , auger ( 2010a ) concluded that a salpeter - type imf was strongly favored over milky way type imf . in order to minimize uncertainties in subtracting off the dark matter ,",
    "dutton , mendel , & simard ( 2012 ) studied the densest @xmath22 of early - type galaxies in the sdss .",
    "these galaxies have a fundamental plane correlation consistent with no dark matter within an effective radius .",
    "the average imf of these galaxies is close to salpeter , with evidence that redder / bluer galaxies have heavier / lighter imfs .",
    "a salpeter - type imf is also favored in the bulges of massive spiral galaxies ( dutton 2013 ) , and brightest cluster galaxies ( newman 2013 ) .",
    "another method for probing the low mass end of the imf ( in non star forming galaxies ) is by measuring the strength of dwarf star sensitive absorption lines .",
    "applying this method to nearby massive elliptical galaxies van dokkum & conroy ( 2010 ) found an imf steeper ( below @xmath23 ) than that of the milky way , and most likely steeper than salpeter .",
    "this result has been confirmed with larger samples of galaxies ( smith 2012 ; spiniello 2012 ; conroy & van dokkum 2012 ) .",
    "these studies also find evidence for a dependence of the ( low mass ) imf slope on stellar velocity dispersion and @xmath17-abundance , with steeper slopes at higher dispersions and shorter star formation timescales .",
    "thus there is good agreement from different methods that the imfs of the most massive or most dense elliptical galaxies are heavier than that of the milky way , and most likely similar to a salpeter imf below @xmath18 .",
    "the next step is to constrain how the imf varies in a more general sample of early - type galaxies .",
    "the atlas3d project has made progress towards this aim ( cappellari 2012a ) , but their study is limited by the inherent degeneracies between the baryonic and dark matter components in the mass modeling of galaxies ( e.g. , dutton 2005 ) . specifically there is a factor of @xmath24 range in derived stellar mass - to - light ratios between models in which mass - follows - light and models with cosmologically motivated adiabatically contracted dark matter haloes ( see also dutton 2011a ) .    in this paper",
    "we place constraints on the mass dependence of the imf and dark halo response using scaling relations of a large sample ( @xmath25 ) of early - type galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , york 2000 ) .",
    "this approach has strengths and weaknesses compared to detailed mass models of individual galaxies ( e.g. , dutton 2011b ; sonnenfeld 2012 ; cappellari 2012a ) .",
    "the weakness is we only get constraints for average galaxies ( of a given mass ) , the strength is that our constraints are free of statistical uncertainties ( in e.g. , stellar mass - to - light ratios , dark halo masses , dark halo concentrations , etc ) that necessarily effect studies with smaller samples .",
    "both approaches are valid , providing complementary constraints to the variability of the imf and dark halo response .",
    "we construct dynamical models that consist of spherical distributions of stars and dark matter .",
    "these models are constrained to reproduce a number of observational and theoretical constraints ( e.g. , dutton 2011a ) .",
    "these models have two unknowns : the stellar imf and the response of the dark matter halo to galaxy formation .",
    "we use the observed stellar velocity dispersion - stellar mass ( faber - jackson ) relation to single out allowable combinations of imf and halo response .",
    "we show that the imf and/or the halo response has to vary with galaxy mass . however , from the velocity dispersion vs stellar mass relation alone , we are unable to uniquely determine which if either should vary , or the absolute normalization of the imf and halo response .",
    "our additional constraint is the slope of the correlation between the residuals of the velocity - stellar mass ( @xmath26 ) and size - stellar mass ( @xmath27 ) relations , which for brevity we denote @xmath28 .",
    "this is a useful constraint because it depends on the dark matter fraction within ( roughly ) the half - light radius ( courteau & rix 1999 ; dutton 2007 ) .",
    "if there is no dark matter then @xmath11 , while dark matter dominated galaxies are expected to have @xmath29 . as we show below @xmath30 is related to a more familiar concept  namely the tilt of the fundamental plane ( fp , dressler 1987 ; djorgovski & davis 1987 ) .",
    "a related approach was taken by borriello ( 2003 ) , who used the fundamental plane constraints the dark matter content of early - type galaxies .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the relation between @xmath30 and the tilt of the fp is shown in  2 , the main observed scaling relations are presented in  3 , with additional details given in appendix a. constraints on the imf and halo response from the velocity - mass relation and the tilt of the fp are discussed in  4 , and  5 respectively . a discussion of systematic effects is given in  6 , and a summary is given in  7 .",
    "appendix a gives the details of our mass models .",
    "we adopt a cosmology with @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33",
    "the fundamental plane is a well - known scaling relation between the size ( @xmath34 ) , and surface brightness ( @xmath35 ) , and velocity dispersion ( @xmath36 ) of early - type galaxies : @xmath37 for @xmath38-band sizes and surface brightnesses , the exponents are @xmath39 ( e.g. bernardi 2003 ) .",
    "this differs from the simplest mass - follows - light model , known as the virial plane , in which @xmath40 .",
    "the differences in exponent are referred to as the tilt of the fundamental plane .",
    "the origin of the tilt has been the subject of debate for many years ( e.g. , van der marel 1991 ; bender , burstein & faber 1992 ; ciotti , lanzoni , & renzini 1996 ; graham & colless 1997 ; prugniel & simien 1996 , 1997 ; pahre , djorgovski , & de carvalho 1998 ; padmanabhan 2004 ; trujillo , burkert , & bell 2004 ; robertson 2006 ; bolton 2007 , 2008 ; graves & faber 2010 ) .",
    "there are two principle explanations for the tilt : ( 1 ) variation of total mass to light ratio ; and ( 2 ) structural non - homology .",
    "using the fact that @xmath41 one can re - write eq .",
    "[ eq : fp1 ] as @xmath42 thus the virial plane corresponds to @xmath43 constant , and the tilt of the fundamental plane corresponds to variation in @xmath44 .    in the case of structural homology",
    "the total mass , @xmath45 , within radius @xmath34 , is directly proportional to @xmath46 , and thus variation in @xmath44 corresponds to variation in @xmath47 .",
    "the total mass - to - light ratio can vary as a result of variation in stellar mass - to - light ( @xmath48 ) or variation in the total mass to stellar mass @xmath49 ratio .",
    "the former is a result of stellar population differences , while the latter is a result of variation of dark matter fractions .    in the case of constant",
    "@xmath47 , structural non - homology results in the total mass not being directly proportional to @xmath46 .",
    "examples of structural non - homology are variation of the stellar mass profile ( e.g. , a variation in the srsic index or concentration parameter ) , and variation in the anisotropy of stellar orbits .",
    "going back to the fundamental plane as written eq .",
    "[ eq : fp1 ] , both coefficients are tilted with respect to the virial prediction .",
    "it turns out that the fundamental plane can be written so that the tilt is in a single coefficient",
    ". we can re - write eq .",
    "[ eq : fp1 ] as @xmath50 where @xmath51 , and @xmath52 .",
    "the corresponding virial coefficients are @xmath53 .",
    "the exponents from bernardi ( 2003 ) result in @xmath54 , and thus the tilt of the @xmath38-band fundamental plane is consistent with being entirely due to @xmath55 . replacing luminosity with stellar mass in eq .",
    "[ eq : fp2 ] , we see that the strength of the correlation between the velocity - mass and size - mass relations is equivalent to the tilt of the fundamental plane , i.e. , @xmath56 .",
    "here we give an overview of our observational sample of early - type galaxies .",
    "we use a similar ( but not identical ) selection procedure as described in more detail in dutton ( 2011a ) . in summary",
    "we use four selection criteria : ( 1 ) a spectroscopic redshift @xmath57 ; ( 2 ) a spectrum classified as early - type by sdss ( eclass @xmath58 ) ; ( 3 ) a red @xmath59 color , based on valley in color - stellar mass plane ; ( 4 ) a minor - to - major axis ratio , @xmath60 ( which removes dusty edge - on spirals ) .",
    "these cuts are designed to select non - star forming galaxies , so our sample includes ellipticals and lenticulars .",
    "we also apply a redshift dependent minimum stellar mass to remove the color bias at fixed stellar mass which results from the sdss @xmath38-band magnitude limit for spectroscopy .",
    "our final sample consists of @xmath61 early - type galaxies .",
    "we use structural parameters ( such as sizes and axis ratios ) from the srsic @xmath62 plus @xmath63 fits of simard ( 2011 ) . unless otherwise stated the sizes we use here , @xmath64 , are the circularized half - light sizes derived from the model of the total light profile .",
    "there are two velocity dispersion measurements publicly available for sdss galaxies .",
    "we refer to these as `` sdss '' and `` princeton '' . at most masses",
    "these two measurements are in excellent agreement , in addition the scatter in these two measurements is in good agreement with the reported uncertainties . however ,",
    "at low masses ( and low dispersions ) there are significant differences ( see also hyde & bernardi 2009 ) . in what follows , for the observed velocity dispersion",
    "we adopt the logarithmic average of the two measurements . where appropriate we will use the individual measurements to gauge systematic uncertainties in scaling relations .    when constructing the faber - jackson relation and the fundamental plane from fiber spectroscopy it is customary to correct the aperture velocity dispersions to some fiducial radius , such as the effective radius ( @xmath65 ) , or one eighth of the effective radius",
    "however , doing so requires making an assumption for the variation of @xmath36 with radius .",
    "since we will directly use the strength of the correlation between @xmath36 and @xmath65 at fixed mass to constrain our models , we do not wish to introduce an artificial correlation . instead",
    ", our approach is to measure observed scaling relations using the uncorrected fiber velocity dispersions , @xmath0 , and to explicitly compute the velocity dispersion within the sdss fiber in our models using the spherical jeans equations ( see appendix a for details ) .",
    "we use stellar masses from the mpa / jhu database .",
    "these are derived by fitting @xmath66 photometry with bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) sps models assuming a chabrier ( 2003 ) imf . to account for a non - universal imf , or systematic errors in stellar mass measurements , we allow for an offset between the true stellar masses , @xmath67 , and these sps stellar masses , @xmath1 , which we denote @xmath68 .",
    "the uncertainty on the stellar masses are nominally @xmath69 dex , but there will be some galaxies with much larger uncertainties . at the highest masses , and largest size - offsets , these outliers can bias the slopes of the scaling relations . as in dutton , mendel , & simard ( 2012 ) we clean the sample by using the relation between stellar mass - to - light ratio and velocity dispersion : @xmath70 vs @xmath0 .",
    "we remove @xmath71 galaxies ( 0.5% of our early - type galaxy sample ) that are more than @xmath72 from the median relation .",
    "this number is @xmath73 times higher than the expected number of high-@xmath36 offsets for log - normal scatter in @xmath70 .",

    "the median errors on velocity , size , and mass are indicated with the compass , and shows that most of the scatter about the median relation is due to observational errors .",
    "note that due to the curvature in the size - mass and velocity - mass relations , the direction of the stellar mass error changes from almost vertical at low masses , to almost horizontal at high masses .",
    "a power - law fit to these data ( over the region indicated by the thick line ) results in a slope of @xmath96 .",
    "the virial fundamental plane has @xmath97 , which is shown with the diagonal dashed line .",
    "thus the fact that we observed @xmath98 is equivalent to the statement that the _ observed _ fundamental plane is tilted with respect to the virial fundamental plane .",
    "the slope varies with @xmath99 , indicating that the tilt of the _ observed _ fundamental plane is not a constant . for large negative size offsets , @xmath100 , suggesting that baryons dominate within the effective radius , whereas for large positive size offsets , @xmath101 , suggesting that there is significant dark matter ( courteau & rix 1999 ) .",
    "these nominal trends of dark matter fraction with size offset are qualitatively consistent with the expectations for galaxies embedded in extended dark matter haloes  for a fixed halo mass and stellar mass , smaller galaxies will have lower dark matter fractions within an effective radius , and hence smaller ( more negative ) @xmath30 .",

    "[ fig : dvr_all ] & [ fig : dvr_mass ] are not corrected for aperture effects or measurement errors , which both tend to weaken the observed correlations .",
    "aperture effects are more important when the fiber only covers a small fraction of the galaxy light ( i.e. , intrinsically larger galaxies or galaxies at lower redshifts ) .",
    "measurement errors in stellar masses are most important ( especially at high masses ) as these couple offsets from the size - mass and velocity mass relations . rather than try to correct the data ( which in the case of aperture corrections is model dependent , and thus non unique )",

    "we start by constructing model samples with a universal chabrier imf .",
    "we consider four halo responses : standard adiabatic contraction @xmath106 ( blumenthal 1986 ) , reduced halo contraction @xmath107 ( c.f . , abadi 2010 ) ; no halo contraction @xmath108 ( i.e. , nfw haloes ) ; and halo expansion @xmath109 .",
    "in addition we consider a model in which mass - follows - light ( mfl ) . for each model",
    "we compute aperture velocity dispersions for 5000 model galaxies evenly spaced in @xmath110 ( from 9.3 to 11.9 ) , and including log - normal scatter in sizes , dark halo masses , and dark halo concentrations .",
    "we then re - sample these galaxies ( 100 times ) according to the observed intrinsic distribution of stellar masses , and add measurement errors in stellar mass , size and velocity dispersion ( see appendix a ) .",
    "this procedure results in a sample of @xmath3 model galaxies with the same distribution of stellar masses and sizes as our observed sample .",
    "the median velocity - mass relations of these models are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vm_chabrier ] .",
    "none of our models is able to reproduce the observed vm relation , even allowing for zero point offsets ( corresponding to different , but still universal imfs ) .",
    "there are two primary solutions to this problem : 1 ) allow the stellar mass to vary from that predicted by a universal chabrier imf , with `` heavier '' imfs in more massive ( i.e. , higher @xmath1 ) galaxies ; or 2 ) allow the halo response to vary with galaxy mass , with e.g. , no halo contraction in low mass galaxies and stronger halo contraction in progressively higher mass galaxies .    in principle",
    ", another solution would be to allow the stellar anisotropy to vary with galaxy mass , however , observations find no evidence for a mass dependence to the stellar anisotropy ( e.g. , gerhard 2001 ) .",
    "furthermore , as we show below , the maximum range of reasonable anisotropy only has a @xmath111 effect on the derived masses .",
    "we now construct models with non - universal imfs and/or non - universal halo responses that reproduce the median vm relation . in ",
    "[ sec : results ] we will use the tilt of the fundamental plane ( fig .  [ fig : dvr_mass ] ) to distinguish between these models .      for mfl models",
    "we can easily calculate the stellar masses required to match the observed velocity dispersions using @xmath112 where @xmath0 is the observed velocity dispersion and @xmath113 is the model velocity dispersion computed assuming @xmath1 .",
    "the stellar mass offset , @xmath114 , as a function of sps mass for two mfl models ( with different anisotropy ) is shown in the right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : vm_model_mfl ] . for @xmath115",
    "the stellar mass offset is well fitted with a linear relation : @xmath116 for both isotropic ( @xmath117 ) and radially anisotropic orbits ( with @xmath118 ) we find a slope of @xmath119 .",
    "this results in a factor of @xmath120 difference in @xmath114 across the range of @xmath1 that we study . in terms of normalization , for @xmath121",
    "we find @xmath122 , which is slightly higher than a salpeter imf ( @xmath123 ) .",
    "previous studies have determined the slope , @xmath124 , for early - type galaxies under the assumption of mfl , spherical symmetry , and isotropic orbits , but using the srsic profile to parametrize the light . for example",
    ", the result from trujillo , burkert & bell ( 2004 ; t04 ) is equivalent to @xmath125 ( assuming a correction of 0.07 for stellar population effects ) , while the result from taylor ( 2010 ; t10 ) is equivalent to @xmath126 ( where the error is dominated by systematics ) .",
    "our result of @xmath127 is consistent with the latter , and shows that the choice of how one parametrizes the light profile is not critical .",
    "while the result from t04 is statistically different from ours , they use a very small sample ( 45 galaxies compared to @xmath128 for t10 , and @xmath3 by us ) and thus are subject to cosmic variance and/or environmental selection effects .",
    "while it is encouraging that our result is consistent with previous studies , it should be stressed that the assumption of mass - follows - light is known to be false in massive early - type galaxies ( e.g. , koopmans 2006 , 2009 ; gavazzi 2008 )  below we will show that it is also unable to account for the tilt of the fundamental plane in massive early - type galaxies .",
    "thus this exercise in building mass - follows - light models and interpreting the tilt of the fundamental plane is somewhat academic ( at least for the most massive galaxies ) .",
    "furthermore , as shown in appendix  [ sec : nonhomology ] , there is a fundamental inconsistency in the methodology of taylor ( 2010 ) .",
    "[ fig : nonhomology ] shows the effects of non - homology on dynamical masses are much weaker when one uses velocity dispersions measured within the effective radius , @xmath103 , compared to one eighth an effective radius , @xmath129 .",
    "however , the standard aperture corrections ( used by e.g. , taylor 2010 ) result in a constant offset of 0.060 dex between @xmath130 and @xmath129 . thus if t10 had corrected the sdss fiber velocity dispersions to @xmath130 and then applied the same assumptions of mfl and isotropy , they would have arrived at different conclusions regarding the importance of non - homology in deriving dynamical masses .",
    "we do not have this inconsistency in our models because we explicitly model the fiber velocity dispersions .",
    "[ fig : jeans ] shows an example mass model consisting of an nfw dark matter halo and a hernquist bulge of stars .",
    "the upper panel shows circular velocity ( black lines ) and aperture velocity dispersion ( red lines ) profiles .",
    "the total circular velocity is given by the solid black line , while the contribution from the stars is given by the black dashed line .",
    "the dark matter halo makes up the difference between these two lines .",
    "the aperture velocity dispersions are given for different values of the anisotropy parameter , @xmath78 , chosen to bracket the values observed in early - type galaxies ( gerhard 2001 ) .",
    "the vertical lines mark useful apertures : @xmath65 is the projected half - light radius ( also known as the effective radius ) , @xmath132 is the 3d half - light radius .",
    "the two most common apertures for measuring or `` correcting '' aperture velocity dispersions are @xmath65 and @xmath133 .",
    "as shown by ( e.g. , wolf 2010 ) , if the radial velocity dispersion profile is constant ( i.e. , @xmath134 ) , then the mass within the 3d half - light radius @xmath135 , where @xmath136 is the integrated line - of - sight velocity dispersion of the system .",
    "this can be more compactly expressed in terms of circular velocity : @xmath137 .",
    "however , in general galaxies do not have constant velocity dispersion profiles , and for galaxies in sdss the observed aperture typically contains less half the light ( see below ) .",
    "thus we expect some variation from the formula from wolf ( 2010 ) .",
    "the lower panel in fig .  [ fig : jeans ] shows the relation between the circular velocity at the 3d half - light radius ( @xmath138 ) , and the projected velocity dispersion ( @xmath139 ) measured within a radius @xmath34 . for large apertures",
    "@xmath140 the circular velocity is indeed almost independent of anisotropy .",
    "however , for the typical apertures for sdss galaxies ( @xmath141 ) , there is a non - negligible dependence of circular velocity on anisotropy .",
    "furthermore , when using velocity dispersions within on eighth of an effective radius , there is a large dependence of circular velocity on anisotropy @xmath142 varies from 1.3 to 1.8 .",
    "thus by correcting the aperture to smaller radii than observed information is lost , while correcting the aperture to larger radii than observed a specific mass profile is assumed .",
    "this motivates us to model the aperture velocity dispersions directly .",
    "the aperture one measures the velocity dispersions inside also impacts the strength of non - homology on the derived dynamical masses . using relations from bertin ( 2002 ) and cappellari ( 2006 ) fig .",
    "[ fig : nonhomology ] shows that effects of non - homology on dynamical masses are significantly weaker when velocity dispersions are measured within the effective radius ( as is typical of galaxies in our study ) compared to one eighth of the effective radius ( as is often used in the literature e.g. , trujillo 2004 ; taylor 2010 ) .    since the standard aperture correction to fiber velocity dispersions ( e.g. , jorgensen 1995 ) results in a constant offset between velocity dispersions measured with @xmath65 and @xmath133 , fig .",
    "[ fig : nonhomology ] reveals a fundamental inconsistency .",
    "obviously , the dynamical masses should be independent of the aperture used to measure the velocity dispersion .",
    "in order for this to be the case with mass - follows - light srsic models , requires the aperture correction depends on srsic index ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : aperture ] ) :      where @xmath144 is ( cappellari ( 2006 ) @xmath145,\\ ] ] and @xmath146 is ( bertin 2002 ) @xmath147 + 0.954\\}.\\ ] ] the factor of half in front of the virial coefficients is due to our defining the dynamical mass to be with the spherical half - light radius , rather than the total mass .      since we are modeling the aperture velocity dispersion , we need to know the physical size of the aperture .",
    "this will depend on the redshift of the galaxy .",
    "[ fig : rap ] shows the aperture radius in kpc as a function of stellar mass . in the upper panel",
    "the solid points show the median relation , while the solid line is a fit to these data points ( see table  [ tab : fits ] for the parameters of the fit ) .",
    "the red dashed line shows the median effective radius ( from fig .",
    "[ fig : vmr ] ) , which shows that for all but the lowest and highest mass galaxies the average sdss aperture is close to the half - light radius . for the most massive galaxies",
    "the median aperture is roughly @xmath148 .",
    "there is scatter in the aperture radius at fixed mass , but it turns out not to induce any significant scatter to the model velocity dispersions .",
    "the observed sampling of the stellar masses of galaxies is not uniform .",
    "the distribution is very roughly log - normal with a peak at @xmath149 ( error bars in fig .",
    "[ fig : mstar ] ) .",
    "measurement uncertainties in stellar masses will preferentially scatter galaxies away from the peak .",
    "we fit the distribution of stellar masses with a set of gaussians ( red lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : mstar ] ) , and since the measurement errors are roughly constant , we can thus deconvolve the observed distribution of stellar masses analytically ( green lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : mstar ] ) .",
    "the differences between the model and deconvolved model are shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : mstar ] .",
    "the most significant differences occur for high masses ( @xmath150 ) , where the deconvolved model has up to a factor of 1.6 fewer galaxies .",
    "the net effect of the non - uniform stellar mass distribution coupled to errors on stellar masses is to make the observed relations ( slightly ) shallower than the true relations .",
    "we add both intrinsic and observational sources of scatter to our models .",
    "there are three primary sources of intrinsic scatter : 1 ) scatter in galaxy size at fixed stellar mass ; 2 ) scatter in the `` pristine '' dark halo concentration at fixed halo mass ; and 3 ) scatter in dark halo mass at fixed stellar mass . the scatter in size at fixed stellar mass",
    "is taken from the observed rm relation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vmr ] ) .",
    "the scatter in the pristine halo concentration for relaxed haloes in cosmological simulations is @xmath151 dex ( jing 2000 ; wechsler 2002 ; macci 2008 ) .",
    "the scatter in stellar mass at fixed halo mass is about 0.15 dex ( e.g. , more 2011 ) .",
    "however due to shallow slope of the stellar mass vs halo mass relation at high halo masses , the scatter in halo mass at fixed stellar mass increases with stellar mass .",
    "the results from more ( 2011 ) for red galaxies can be approximated by @xmath152 , with a minimum of 0.15 .",
    "additionally there is scatter in the aperture radius at fixed stellar mass from the redshift sampling of galaxies , and is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : rap ] .",
    "it turns out that this adds negligible scatter to the vm relation , and so we do not include it in our fiducial models .",
    "there are measurement errors in stellar masses , sizes and velocity dispersions .",
    "these measurement errors are roughly constant ( fig .",
    "[ fig : err ] ) with @xmath153 , @xmath154 and @xmath155 . for our purposes",
    "the measurement errors in stellar masses and sizes are more important than the measurement errors in velocity dispersions .",
    "this is because we bin galaxies in both stellar mass and size , but not velocity dispersion .",
    "errors in stellar masses can change the slope of the correlation between vm and rm residuals , and thus are especially important to account for ."
