    "electroweak precision tests@xcite@xcite ( ewpts ) performed in the last few decades have achieved great success in establishing the standard model ( sm ) as the correct description of electroweak physics .",
    "nevertheless , we are certain the sm is incomplete and expect new physics to appear at the tev scale .",
    "the lack of experimental deviations from the sm predictions does not rule out tev scale new physics .",
    "rather , it provides us guidance on the directions we should pursue . the purpose of this review is to provide readers quick access to necessary knowledge and tools for constraining various extensions of the sm .    in order to be model",
    "independent , we adopt the effective field theory@xcite ( eft ) approach .",
    "eft is a powerful tool when there is a distinctive scale separating the low energy and the high energy dynamics .",
    "the basic ideal is that the low energy physics can be described by an effective lagrangian containing a few degrees of freedom which are not sensitive to extra degrees of freedom related to the details of the high energy physics .",
    "fermi s theory of weak interaction is a well known example .    for our purpose ,",
    "given a tev scale model , we first integrate out all new physical states and obtain a set of effective operators involving the sm fields .",
    "these operators are added to the sm lagrangian and introduce new interactions among the sm particles .",
    "consequently they contribute to electroweak observables ( ewpos ) and cause deviations from the sm predictions .",
    "since that the experiments agree with the sm remarkably well , the deviations must be small .",
    "this is where the constraints come from .",
    "the key observation in favor of the effective theory approach is that the relevant effective operators are actually much fewer than the vast possibilities of physics beyond the sm .",
    "therefore , it is natural to reverse the above procedure , namely , we first calculate constraints on all possible effective operators ( and operator combinations ) without specifying the model .",
    "once this is done , the remaining work for constraining a given model is to obtain the operator coefficients in terms of parameters in that model . in this approach",
    ", one needs to make contact with experimental data only once . in this review",
    ", we will show how to calculate corrections to ewpos from the effective operators , assuming arbitrary coefficients , while refer readers to ref .   on how to obtain operator coefficients from an underlying theory .",
    "schematically , the effective theory can be written as @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the standard model lagrangian and @xmath2 s are operators containing _ only _ the sm fields .",
    "since we are interested in extensions of the sm , we assume that @xmath2 s respect the sm gauge symmetry . below the new physics scale ,",
    "all effects of the new physical states are encoded in @xmath2 s .",
    "of course one can only work with operators to a given order and higher order operators have to be truncated .",
    "the power counting depends on whether the electroweak symmetry is linearly or non - linearly realized .",
    "for the former , @xmath1 is renormalizable and the electroweak symmetry is broken by the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of a higgs doublet .",
    "the power counting is determined by the canonical dimensions of the operators @xmath2 , @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the dimension of @xmath2 , @xmath5 s are dimensionless parameters and @xmath6 is an energy scale of @xmath7 . for the non - linear case",
    ", the sm spectrum does not contain a light higgs boson and @xmath1 is a non - linear sigma model . in this review ,",
    "i will concentrate on the linear case while also explain how to translate the results to the nonlinear case .    the effective theory breaks down if the new physics contains physical states much lighter than 1 tev .",
    "for example , the mass of the lightest neutralino can be as low as @xmath8 in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) . in this case",
    ", there is not an energy scale that distinctly separates the new physics from the sm , and an eft without the new states is not well defined .",
    "nevertheless , the new states do not appear in initial or final states in any of the ewpt processes and their dominant contributions can often be captured in a few effective operators .    with the effective lagrangian ( [ eq : lagrangian ] ) defined ,",
    "the theoretical prediction for a given observable @xmath9 can be written as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the sm prediction including loop corrections , which can be found in the literature@xcite@xcite .",
    "@xmath12 is the correction to @xmath9 from the operator @xmath2 .",
    "the current experimental precision allows us to keep only the corrections linear in the operator coefficients @xmath13 .",
    "most of the review will be devoted to the calculation of @xmath12 , for all well measured ewpos .",
    "after obtaining @xmath14 , we can compare the theoretical predictions with the measured values of @xmath9 and get constraints on the coefficients @xmath13 .",
    "the constraints are conveniently given in the @xmath15 distribution , @xmath16 ^ 2}{\\sigma_x^2},\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the experimental value of @xmath9 , and @xmath18 includes both experimental and theoretical errors . in practice , the above expression is complicated from correlations between different observables .",
    "at this step the advantage of the effective theory approach is manifest : all relevant experimental information has been collected in the @xmath15 distribution , which is a simple quadratic function of the operator coefficients @xmath13 .",
    "there have been many analyses using the effective theory approach in the literature@xcite@xcite .",
    "the oblique parameters@xcite@xcite are perhaps the best known example .",
    "the results are often given in different bases or conventions . in this review",
    ", we will adopt the basis in ref .",
    ", where all independent dimension-6 operators of the sm are included",
    ". they are discussed and trimmed according to our needs in the next section .",
    "in particular , we will identify the operators relevant to ewpts .",
    "section [ sec : experiments ] contains a summary of the ewpos included in this review . in section [ sec : calculations ] , we calculate corrections to ewpos from the effective operators .",
    "the constraints are then given in section [ sec : constraints ] .",
    "the analysis largely follows ref .  .",
    "section [ sec : discussions ] contains a few discussions , including translations between different bases and conventions .",
    "for establishing the notation and later convenience , we give explicitly the sm lagrangian , @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 denote gauge field strength of the sm gauge groups @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively . for simplicity ,",
    "we have assumed there is only one higgs doublet , denoted by @xmath26 .",
    "the number of higgs doublets is irrelevant for corrections to ewpos at tree level , since all their contributions are through the electroweak breaking vev , @xmath27 with @xmath28 .",
    "the left - handed fermion doublets are denoted @xmath29 and @xmath30 and the right - handed singlets @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 . for simplicity",
    ", we have omitted the corresponding subscripts @xmath34 and @xmath35 and also the flavor indices .",
    "variations of the sm lagrangian with respect to the fields give us equations of motion , which we can use to eliminate redundant operators@xcite .",
    "two of them will prove useful in our discussion later , which are listed below .",
    "they are obtained by varying @xmath36 and @xmath37 respectively .",
    "@xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are gauge couplings of @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath41 is the hypercharge of fermion @xmath42 .    substituting the higgs vev in the sm lagrangian",
    ", we arrive at the mass eigenstates , @xmath43 where @xmath44 then the couplings between gauge bosons and fermions can be read from the covariant derivative , @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the fermion charge and @xmath47 it is often convenient to write the @xmath48-fermion couplings in terms of @xmath49 and @xmath50 as defined by @xmath51 the sm values for @xmath49 and @xmath50 , denoted @xmath52 and @xmath53 , are given by @xmath54      usually , experiments considered as ewpts conserve cp , as well as baryon and lepton numbers . constraints on processes violating these symmetries are very stringent , indicating that they are irrelevant to tev scale physics .",
    "for example , operators contributing to proton decay have to be suppressed by the grand unification scale or higher .",
    "cp violating operators that contribute to @xmath55 mass difference or lepton electric dipole moment are typically suppressed by a scale of @xmath56 to @xmath57 tev@xcite@xcite .",
    "therefore , it is convenient to restrict us to operators conserving cp , and baryon and lepton numbers .",
    "similarly , constraints on flavor violating processes are also stringent ( with the exception of processes involving the third generation ) . in the lepton sector , the limits on @xmath58 decay implies @xmath57 tev suppression for contributing operators@xcite . in the quark sector , limits on new physics scale obtained from a variety of @xmath59 processes are also above @xmath56 to @xmath57 tev@xcite .",
    "therefore , we will assume that the operators , and therefore the observables included in this review all conserve flavors .",
    "the only dimension-5 operator that respects the sm gauge symmetry is the neutrino majorana mass operator , which does not conserve lepton number and is irrelevant to ewpts .",
    "not counting flavors , there are 80 independent dimension-6 operators that conserve baryon and lepton numbers@xcite , out of which 28 violate cp .",
    "we will go through the remaining 52 operators in this section and identify those contributing to the ewpos .    for our purpose ,",
    "it is enough to consider dimension-6 operators only .",
    "dimension-7 operators do not contribute to ewpts at tree level , and we do not need to go to dimension-8 or higher . the reason is the following : compared with the sm contribution , the corrections from operator @xmath2 is suppressed by @xmath60 or @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the energy scale involved in the ewpts . for dimension-6 operators , this suppression is roughly equal to the experimental precision of the ewpos when @xmath6 is a few tev .",
    "the suppression factor is much smaller for the dimension-8 operators which makes their contributions to ewpos negligible unless they have extraordinarily large coefficients .",
    "the above reasoning indicates that when calculating the corrections to the ewpos from the dimension-6 operators , we only need to work to the linear order in @xmath63 , since the quadratic corrections are much smaller and therefore can be neglected .",
    "this means we only need to work at tree level for those operators discussed later . due to the high precision of this measurement ,",
    "loop level diagrams are also important . ] .",
    "moreover , when calculating from the matrix element to the cross - section , only the _ interferences _ between the sm feynman diagrams and diagrams induced by new operators are important . this important observation will be used to reduce the number of operators .",
    "the linear - order assumption also helps us understand why we only need the vev of the higgs doublet : the physical higgs boson contributes to ewpos only at loop levels , any corrections to the higgs mass or coupling from dimension-6 operators will be suppressed by an extra loop factor when calculating the corrections to ewpos and therefore negligible .",
    "the 52 dimension-6 operators that conserve cp are enumerated below .",
    "the naming scheme follows ref .  , with small changes in the notation .",
    "we will identify those that are relevant to ewpts by general arguments in this section .",
    "more detailed calculations are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : calculations ] .",
    "if the analysis here is too sketchy for the reader , it should become clear later on .",
    "1 .   vectors only @xmath64 the two operators affect triple gauge couplings . at tree level ,",
    "the former only affects pure hadronic processes , which are not measured as well as ewpos .",
    "therefore , only the operator @xmath65 is interesting to us .",
    "fermions only 1 .",
    "@xmath66 operators @xmath67 2 .",
    "@xmath68 operators @xmath69 3 .",
    "@xmath70 operators + for convenience , we have changed the form from @xmath71 in ref .   to @xmath70 by using the fierz transformation @xmath72 @xmath73 4 .   @xmath74 operators @xmath75 + again we can safely ignore those operators containing four quarks . for the operators @xmath76 and @xmath77 , they contain pieces @xmath78 and @xmath79 that contribute to the process @xmath80 . however , the corresponding sm contribution are highly suppressed by electron and quark yukawas , which are negligible .",
    "since we are only interested in interferences between the sm and the new physics , the contributions from @xmath76 and @xmath77 are negligible too .",
    "thus the interesting operators are : @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 .",
    "scalars only @xmath92 the two operators affect the higgs mass and self - coupling , which are negligible as explained earlier .",
    "fermions and vectors @xmath93 at first sight , these operators alter couplings between the gauge bosons and the fermions . however , the couplings are imaginary compared with the sm couplings .",
    "therefore the sm diagrams do not interfere with the new diagrams .-",
    "pole , the @xmath48-exchange diagrams with the new couplings do interfere with the sm @xmath94-exchange diagrams and vice versa .",
    "however , these interferences are suppressed further by @xmath95 besides the factor @xmath96 .",
    "therefore , they are negligible too . ] in this case , corrections from these operators can be ignored .",
    "scalars and vectors @xmath97 when @xmath26 acquires a vev , the operators @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 yield corrections to the kinetic terms for @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath26 , which can be absorbed by field redefinitions .",
    "therefore , they do not contribute to ewpos at the order @xmath102 .",
    "the other two operators @xmath103 and @xmath104 ( simplified as @xmath105 in the rest of the review ) modify the gauge boson propagators .",
    "indeed , they correspond to the well - known oblique @xmath106 and @xmath107 parameters .",
    "one also notices that @xmath103 contains corrections to triple gauge couplings .",
    "fermions and scalars @xmath108 the effects of these operators can be absorbed in the sm yukawa couplings and therefore do not make any contribution . 7 .",
    "fermions , gauge bosons and scalar 1 .",
    "one derivative @xmath109 when @xmath26 gets a vev , these operators modify the gauge - fermion couplings and therefore are important for our calculation .",
    "it is worth noting that the operator @xmath110 induces a coupling in the form @xmath111 which is absent in the sm . in other words",
    ", there is no interference for diagram containing this coupling and the sm diagram .",
    "therefore , we expect loose bound on the operator @xmath110 .",
    "2 .   two derivatives @xmath112 like operators in eqs .  ( [ eq : hff ] ) , hermitian conjugate should be added to each operator above .",
    "most of these operators do not have a tight bound from ewpts .",
    "they all produce couplings absent in the sm in the tree level and therefore do not interfere with the sm diagrams .",
    "the exception is @xmath113 and @xmath114 , which contribute at tree level to the lepton @xmath115 .",
    "indeed , the precision for electron and muon @xmath115 measurements are so good that if we naively take the operator coefficients to be @xmath116 , the bound on @xmath6 will be larger than @xmath117 tev . usually , the contribution from tev scale physics is suppressed by both the loop factor and the lepton mass , which makes it too small to compare with the experiments for the electron @xmath118 is one of the measurements from which the input parameter @xmath119 is determined . ] and the bounds from muon @xmath118 comparable to the other ewpos .",
    "other dimension-6 operators can also make sizable contributions to muon @xmath115 at one loop level .",
    "we will come back to this observable later .",
    "the relevant operators are summarized below .",
    "following ref .  , we have simplified the notation by replacing superscripts @xmath120 and @xmath121 with @xmath122 and @xmath123 , denoting singlets and triplets respectively .    1 .",

    "flavors can be conserved separately for each generation . in this case , each of the @xmath2 s actually corresponds to several operators with different flavors and independent coefficients .",
    "this is the most general case .",
    "however , it requires the quarks in the operators to be mass eigenstates .",
    "therefore the new physics must be aligned with the yukawa matrices , which seems unnatural and is difficult to realize .",
    "a simpler option is imposing flavor universality for the effective operators .",
    "this is natural for flavor - blind new physics , for example , a @xmath129 gauge boson that couples to all generations universally . in this case",
    ", each @xmath2 corresponds to several operators with different flavors but the same coefficient @xmath13 .",
    "the operators should be understood to be contracted over flavor indices ( in the 4-fermion operators , flavor indices are contracted over fermions ( 12 ) and ( 34 ) respectively . in the following analysis ,",
    "unless specified , we will assume flavor universality .",
    "nevertheless , calculations for flavor universal and non - universal cases are very similar and it is straightforward to translate from one case to the other .",
    "flavor universality is assumed in the analysis of ref .  .",
