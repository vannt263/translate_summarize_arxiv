    "the final 2d spectrum was a weighted mean of the individual frames .",
    "weights were determined using variation in the brightness of the reference object , under the assumption that such variation was the result of small guiding errors . a 1d spectrum was extracted using an optimal extraction vector determined from the calibration star continuum shape .",

    "a2 is well separated from nearby objects and we measure its flux using aperture photometry .",
    "the w5 photometry is contaminated by its juxtaposition with the foreground cd galaxy .",
    "we measure the flux from w5 in a small aperture ( 0.3 arcsecond radius ) .",
    "to estimate contamination from the cd galaxy , we measure the same aperture in other regions of the cd galaxy at equal distance from its center .",
    "we then perform an aperture correction to estimate w5 s total flux , basing the correction on the curve of growth of a2 . to check this procedure",
    ", we also measured w5 in an image with a model of the cd galaxy subtracted ( from s98 ) and obtained results consistent at the 20% level .      in order to compare the new observations directly with the spectrum of cb58",
    ", we have re - reduced that data to use the same flux calibration technique . in t00 ,",
    "the flux calibration relied on measurement of the equivalent width using the continuum in the spectrum .",
    "they performed a linear fit to the continuum across the entire wavelength range ( either j , h or k ) and used the derived flux at the wavelength of each emission line in the calculation of the equivalent width ( ew ) .",
    "this procedure was not fully explained in the text of t00 .    in the present data , ews can not be measured directly from the spectra , because detection of the continuum is poor . instead",
    ", the ew of lines in a2 is estimated as the ratio of the measured flux to the continuum flux density in the photometry .",
    "the flux density is normalized to the median wavelength of the filter , and the slope of the continuum is assumed to match that measured in cb58 .",
    "h - band photometry is not yet available for a2 or w5 . for a2 , we assume that the h - k color is the same as in cb58 .",
    "the optical colors are of the two counterparts are nearly identical .",
    "this assumption introduces an unknown uncertainty into our ability to compare the ew([oiii ] ) of a2 to cb58 .",
    "the k - band photometry of w5 has a low signal to noise ratio , and the h - k color is not known , so ews are not estimated for w5 .",
    "the lines must have fairly high equivalent width to be detectable , given how faint w5 is in the continuum .",
    "we do not detect the continuum in the spectra , but the lines are convincingly real .",
    "each line is detected in each of the individual exposures of each nodded pair of spectra .",
    "each step in the calculation of the ew has an associated uncertainty :    first , we measure the line intensity in dn and convert to flux using the spectrophotometric calibration from the standard star .",
    "the spectrophotometric calibration is uncertain due to our knowledge of the standard star and the variation in the atmosphere between the observations of the source and of the standard .",
    "together , we assume those factors introduce a 10% uncertainty .",
    "the measurement of the line is uncertain due to shot noise in the background and poisson noise in the source .",
    "we measure these from the square root of an extracted sky spectrum added to the object spectrum .",
    "next , we divide by the flux density of the continuum under the line , assuming the slope of the continuum in a2 matches that in cb58 .",
    "the linear fit is uncertain at the 5% level ( based on repeated measurements of the cb58 spectrum ) .",
    "the linear fit is normalized by the photometric measurement , which has less than 10% uncertainty for cb58 , but has 16% uncertainty in a2 .",
    "finally , as noted above , the [ oiii ] measurement has additional ( unquantified ) uncertainty due to the current lack of h - band photometry .",
    "figure [ fig : kimage ]  shows the nirspec - scam k - band image of the ms1512 field .",
    "table [ tab : phot ]  lists the photometry measured in the wfpc2 and nirspec imaging .",
    "figure [ fig : 2d spectra ]  shows the two dimensional nirspec spectra ; figures [ fig : 1d hspec ]  and [ fig : 1d kspec ]  show the extracted h and k spectra of a2 and w5 . we clearly detect the [ oiii ] doublet and h@xmath18  in both objects .",
    "h@xmath19  falls partially on a night sky line .",
    "table [ tab : emlines ]  gives the measured flux for the  and [ oiii ] 5007  emission lines .",
    "the spectra confirm that a2 is a magnification of the same source galaxy as cb58 .",
    "their redshifts are nearly identical , @xmath20  compared to @xmath21  ( t00 ) .",
    "the @xmath22-band wfpc2 photometry is consistent with the s98 measurements from separate reduction of the same data .",
    "the additional @xmath23- and k - band data confirm the brightness and therefore that the magnification of a2 is @xmath24  times less than that of cb58 .",
    "any possible differential velocity between a2 and cb58 must be less than 125 km s@xmath5 .",
    "this small velocity difference provides no evidence of a systematic rotational velocity across the face of the source galaxy .",

    "2003 ) observe rotational velocities of @xmath25  km s@xmath5  from  in lbgs at @xmath26 .",
    "only the largest values of @xmath27  in their sample would be detectable with the resolution we obtain in comparing a2 and cb58 .",
    "that is , if @xmath27   were calculated only twice for each galaxy in the erb et al .",

    "gradients of that magnitude are detectable with our resolution .",
    "the limit on rotational velocity in the a source is consistent with the value inferred from the emission line widths .",
    "the fwhm of lines detected in cb58 suggests @xmath30  , after correcting for instrumental resolution .",
    "none of the emission lines in a2 are resolved in velocity .",
    "given the four - pixel entrance slit , this velocity resolution limit is @xmath31  km s@xmath5 , which is consistent with cb58 .",
    "the resolution of the a2 spectra is lower than in the cb58 observation , because we used a wider entrance slit for a2 .",
    "comparison of the characteristics of a2 and cb58 provide spatially resolved information about the source galaxy .",
    "the ratio of the strongest emission lines ( , [ oiii ] ) is the same , within the uncertainties , for the two arcs .",
    "better measurements are needed to estimate metallicity from the a2 spectra .",
    "detections of  and [ oii ] would allow us to infer the oxygen abundance from the ( [ oii ] + [ oiii])/  ratio , which is often denoted @xmath32  ( pagel et al .   1979 ) . nonetheless , the : [ oiii ] ratio suggests that the metallicity is the same in a2 as cb58 , indicating no metallicity gradient in the source galaxy .",
    "a strong spatial variation of the extinction could also cause a difference in the emission - line ratio , so we conclude that the extinction has no strong gradient .",
    "[ nii ] is marginally detected .",
    "its ew is consistent with cb58 as measured by t00 , but we can not rule out a factor of two overestimate in the previous measurement as suggested by pettini et al .",
    "the nitrogen abundance sets a lower limit on the age of the galaxy if it is high enough to require a secondary phase of metal production ( kobulnicky & zaritsky 1999 ) .",
    "the pettini et al .",
    "estimate suggests that such a phase is not needed .",
    "a possible difference between cb58 and a2 is that the ew of the strong emission lines in a2 is larger than that observed in cb58 .",
    "this difference is significant only at the 2.5@xmath33  level in the current data , but is nonetheless intriguing .",
    "we assume that the continuum comes mostly from older stars and that the strong emission lines are reprocessed radiation from young stars .",
    "the difference in ew , then , may result from a non - uniform distribution of recent star formation across the face of the source galaxy . adopting this explanation ,",
    "we infer the relative the star formation rate ( sfr ) in the two images of the a source . from kennicutt ( 1998 ) : @xmath34 .",
    "the sfr of a2 is 144 , only a factor of four lower than cb58 , compared to a magnification ratio of 11 .",
    "the lensing reconstruction ( s98 ) shows that cb58 is a magnification of only half the galaxy , including most of the nuclear region .",
    "it is unlikely , therefore , that the difference is simply the result of nucleus - centered star formation .",
    "the apparent ew difference between a2 and cb58 is strikingly large .",
    "both images encompass at least half of the source galaxy .",
    "thus , an ew ratio of two would imply that the part of the galaxy not magnified into cb58 has a line to continuum ratio that is three times larger of the other half .",
    "this difference would be surprising for a galaxy that does not have an highly irregular morphology .",
    "although , there are examples of intrinsically asymmetric starbursts at similar redshift ( lowenthal et al .",
    "1996 ) , perhaps the results of mergers ( conselice et al .  2003 ) , there is no indication of such asymmetry in the hst image of cb58 . in fact , s98 suggest that , contrary to our results , cb58 should be a `` zoom '' into the region of highest star formation density .",
    "the location of w5 is consistent with the position of a lensing arc of the w source galaxy as predicted by s98 .",
    "we convincingly measure   and [ oiii ] , although the continuum is too faint for detection . from the optical emission lines ,",
    "we infer a systematic redshift of @xmath35 .",
    "this redshift confirms the s98 prediction that the w source is a different galaxy than the a source , although both are at similar redshift .",
    "the faintest component of the w system , wc ( see figure [ fig : fc ] ) , has a magnitude of @xmath36  ( s98 ) .",
    "wc is too faint to be seen in the nirspec k - band image .",
    "extinction by the cd galaxy may suppress the observed @xmath22-band flux of w5 , but it is about a magnitude brighter than wc , so it appears to be magnified by at least that much .",
    "the @xmath37-band detection of w5 is consistent with this estimate , but the @xmath37-band fluxes of both w5 and wc are more uncertain .",
    "the one magnitude of magnification is small compared to the factor of 10 by which the w1 component of the system is magnified ( s98 ) .    from the magnification - corrected  emission line",
    ", we can infer sfr of the w source .",
    "a magnification factor of 2.5 suggests an unlensed sfr of 6 @xmath3 .",
    "it is impractical to infer the sfr from the uv continuum of w5 , given the extinction by the cd galaxy .",
    "we can estimate the redshifted 1500  continuum of the w source from the f555w flux of its other lensed images .",
    "the uv continuum implies sfr@xmath38   ( kennicutt 1998 ) .",
    "this factor of four difference between the sfrs inferred from  and the uv , is the same as the difference observed for cb58 .",
    "the /[oiii ] ratio in w5 , @xmath39 , is significantly lower than in the a source .",
    "this ratio is an upper limit , as one might expect there to be some absorption by the foreground cd galaxy .",
    "it is tempting to explain the difference in the /[oiii ] ratio between the w5 and cb58 ( i.e. the a source ) as the result of lower intrinsic reddening in the w source .",
    "however , we have seen that the ratio of sfrs inferred for the w source from uv - continuum and  is consistent with the extinction in the cb58 , e(b - v)@xmath40  ( t00 ; pettini et al .",
    "2000 ; baker et al .",
    "apart from reddening , the stronger [ oiii ] emission in w5 could also be a sign that it has lower metallicity than cb58 .",
    "oxygen line strengths in sub - solar metallicity galaxies can decrease with increasing oxygen abundances due to cooling",
    ". a lower limit on this effect occurs at @xmath41 , because the lack of oxygen atoms reduces the line strength ( i.e.   kobulnicky et al .  1999 ) .",
    "the w source is likely to have relatively low metallicity ; most lbgs have oxygen abundances of several tenths of solar ( pettini et al .",
    "2001 ) , and metallicity is typically lower in less massive star forming galaxies ( i.e. melbourne & salzer 2002 ) .",
    "finally , the [ oiii ] strength in w5 could be an indication of an active nucleus .",
    "however , we do not detect other lines that might be expected from a narrow - line seyfert ( such as strong [ oi ] 6300 ) or the presence of broadened wings to the balmer line .",
    "we do not know the transverse separation of the a and w sources in the spatial dimension , but we expect that it is smaller than the apparent separation between the counter arcs .",
    "the separation of cb58 and a2 is 15.3 , and the widest separation in the w system is comparable . at @xmath42 ,",
    "this implies a proper distance of 121 kpc .",
    "such a separation suggests these objects are not interacting , but may be in a small group .",
    "it is possible that other potential lensed objects in the system are at the same redshift .",
    "some members of the same group may lie outside the region magnified by the foreground lensing cluster .",
    "the large magnification of cb58 makes it an important target for available instrumentation at many wavelengths .",
    "for example , it is a planned target for spitzer guaranteed time observations , which will probe the star - formation and dust content of such galaxies .",
    "the addition of the counter arc , a2 , and the companion galaxy , w , serve to increase the return on future observations of the field .",
    "we expect that confirmation of the c and possibly b sources will soon show them to be members the same group .",
    "we have shown that a2 is the counter image of ms1512-cb58 .",
    "the spatial resolution provided by differential magnification suggests an uneven distribution of star - forming regions in the source galaxy .",
    "the rotational velocity limit obtained from the a2 spectrum supports other observations of lbgs at somewhat lower redshift .",
    "we have also confirmed the existence of the companion w source , which is intrinsically fainter than the a source .",
    "the probable lower metallicity in the w source might be evidence of the luminosity - abundance relationship at high redshift ( kobulnicky et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "these lensed lbgs are valuable examples of moderate luminosity galaxies .",
    "the magnification enables detailed studies of average luminosity galaxies at high redshift .",
    "a larger sample is still needed , however , to draw more general conclusions .",
    "other galaxy clusters offer magnified star - forming galaxies at high redshift as well ( i.e.   fosbury et al .",
    "2003 ) , but so far none of comparable brightness have been discovered .",
    "future study of lensed lbgs will extend to higher redshifts ( i.e. ellis et al .",
    "in fact , the observation of gravitationally lensed sources may reveal the highest redshift and intrinsically faintest sources ( pell  et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
