    "current - driven instabilities are important for anomalous resistivity and related energy release in weakly collisional space plasmas , like the solar corona , solar wind and planetary magnetospheres .",
    "kinetic instabilities of ion - acoustic , ion - cyclotron , and lower - hybrid drift waves were studied extensively in this context ( duijveman et al . , 1981 ; bchner & elkina 2006 , and references therein ) .",
    "more recently , the electron - current driven kinetic alfvn instability has been discussed as a possible source for the anomalous resistivity ( voitenko , 1995 ) , and the anomalous resistivity scaling in solar flares has been shown to be compatible with the kinetic alfvn scenario ( singh & subramanian , 2007 ) .",
    "these instabilities were classified as resonant instabilities driven by the inverse electron landau damping ( i.e. , by the cherenkov - resonant electrons ) .",
    "the off - resonant electrons with velocities far from the wave phase velocities interact with waves adiabatically and do not contribute to the wave growth .    on the contrary ,",
    "the non - resonant current instability of the alfvn mode ( malovichko & iukhimuk , 1992a,1992b ; malovichko , 2007 ) is driven by the total electric current rather than the resonant electrons only . this `` pure '' current instability ( pci )",
    "was originally applied to the terrestrial auroral zones ( malovichko & iukhimuk , 1992a ) , and then studied in application to the coronal loops in the solar atmosphere ( malovichko & iukhimuk , 1992b ; malovichko , 2007 ; chen & wu , 2012 ) .",
    "pci instability appeared to be universal in sense that the threshold current is virtually zero in uniform unbounded plasmas .",
    "besides the applied external electric fields ( electrostatic of inductive ) , the electron and ion currents can also be induced in the background plasma by other sources , like injected particle beams .",
    "we are interested here in the cases where the currents injected by hot ion beams are compensated by the return currents of the background electrons ( or by co - propagating electron beams ) .",
    "this situation occurs in many space and astrophysical plasmas .",
    "for example , high - energy ion beams accelerated by shocks set up compensated - current systems upstream of the terrestrial bow shock ( paschmann et al . , 1981 ) , and references therein ) and around supernova remnants ( bell , 2005 , and references therein ) .",
    "in addition to the mentioned above current driven instabilities , several ion - beam instabilities can develop in the compensated - current systems created by the ion beams . in the early works by sentmann et al .",
    "( 1981 ) , winske & leroy ( 1984 ) , gary ( 1985 ) , it was believed that the parallel - propagating alfvn and fast modes are most unstable .",
    "later on , the resonant oblique ( kinetic ) alfvn instabilities driven by ion beams have been shown to be more important in certain parameter ranges .",
    "so , analytical treatments ( voitenko , 1998 ; voitenko & goossens , 2003 ; verscharen & chandran , 2013 ) and numerical simulations ( daughton et al . 1999 ; gary et al . 2000 ) have demonstrated that the ion - cyclotron ( alfvn i in the terminology by daughton et al . ) and cherenkov ( alfvn ii ) instabilities of oblique alfvn waves are often faster than the parallel ones .",
    "these instabilities were in particular studied in application to the alpha - particle flows in the solar wind ( gary et al . , 2000 ; verscharen & chandran 2013 ) .    because of the incomplete knowledge of plasma instabilities that can arise , behavior of such complex systems is still not well understood . for example ,",
    "evolution of the ions reflected from the terrestrial bow shock , and responsible waves and instabilities , remain uncertain . the same concerns cosmic ray acceleration by the shocks around super - nova remnants .",
    "it is important to know what instabilities can arise there , and which one can dominate for particular beam and plasma parameters .",
    "recently , a new mhd - type instability driven by the return currents induced by cosmic rays in the foreshock plasma around supernova remnants was found by bell ( 2004,2005 ) .",
    "a similar return - current instability was found earlier by winske & leroy ( 1983 ) , but they did not elucidate the main physical factor leading to the instability and hence did not categorize it as a current - driven .    in the present paper",
    "we investigate a new non - resonant instability that arises in the compensated - current systems created by fast and hot ion beams .",
    "in such systems the beam current is compensated by the return background current and one should not expect pci studied by malovichko & iukhimuk and by chen & wu . however",
    ", oblique alfvn perturbations with short perpendicular wavelengths respond differently to the currents carried by the electrons and the currents carried by the ions .",
    "the difference arises because of the different ion and electron gyroradii , such that the ion and electron current - related terms do not cancel each other .",
    "the resulting compensated - current oblique instability ( ccoi ) develops at sufficiently high beam currents and temperatures .",
    "the instability is essentially oblique and its growth rate attains a maximum when its cross - field wavelength is close to the beam ion gyroradius .",
    "a particular compensated - current system is considered consisting of the low - density hot ion beam propagating along @xmath0 , the motionless background ions , and the electron components providing the neutralizing return current .",
    "the neutralizing electron current can be set up by the background electron component and/or by the co - propagating electron beam . in the context of our study it is important to note that the final result does not depend on the way how the return electron current is set up ; it is enough that the gyroradius of the current - carrying electrons is much smaller than the ion beam gyroradius .    for each unperturb plasma component",
    "we use a @xmath1-shifted maxwellian velocity distribution @xmath2where @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and  @xmath1  are the mean number density , temperature , and parallel velocity , respectively , and @xmath5 is the particle mass . the species @xmath6 can be background ions ( @xmath7 ) , background electrons ( @xmath8 ) , beam ions ( @xmath9 ) , and beam electrons ( @xmath10 ) .",

    "the zero net current condition reads as @xmath15where summation is over all electron components .",

    "expansion ( [ j > ] ) is already good for @xmath74 at @xmath77 , where the relative error is less than 0.1 .",
    "note that @xmath65 does not imply @xmath78 if the beam is hotter than the background .    in the absence of compensated currents , @xmath79 @xmath80 @xmath81 , the equation ( [ de ] ) splits into two independent equations for mhd alfvn and fast mode waves ( the slow mode was dropped from ( [ de ] ) because of the low plasma @xmath63 ) . in the presence of @xmath82 the alfvn and fast mode waves are coupled , and the solution corresponding to alfvn mode reads as @xmath83    the dispersion relation ( [ aw ] ) for alfvnic perturbations provides a basis for our analysis . the current term containing @xmath82 shifts down the alfvn wave frequency squared and can make it negative , which means an aperiodic instability .",

    "we will consider hereafter only the isotropic case @xmath105 , implying a pure beam - driven fire - hose instability .",
    "the comparison of ccoi and fhi thresholds is shown in fig . 1 for the case of hot beam , @xmath106 , in the isotropic background , @xmath105 .",
    "the ccoi threshold for such hot beam is significantly lower than the fhi threshold in a wide range of beam velocities .",
    "these parameter ranges are relevant for compensated - current systems created in the solar wind by hot ion beams propagating upstream of the terrestrial bow shock ( see in more detail below ) .",
    "the parallel - propagating left- and right - hand resonant instabilities studied by gary ( 1985 ) have the velocity thresholds @xmath107 and @xmath108 , respectively . the ccoi velocity threshold found from ( [ nthr ] ) ,",

    "[ f2 ]    the full wavenumber dependence of the ccoi dispersion ( [ aw1 ] ) is shown in the contour plot fig . 2 for the well above - threshold beam current @xmath119 and thermal velocity @xmath106 .",

    "it is seen that the instability range is bounded in the @xmath121-space , and both the lower and upper bounds , @xmath122 and @xmath123 , are finite and non  zero . in contrast , the lower bound of the unstable parallel wavenumber range is zero . for the well over - threshold currents ,",
    "the analytical expressions for the boundaries in the @xmath124-space can be obtained as @xmath125for the high-@xmath121 boundary , and @xmath126for the low-@xmath121 boundary .",
    "since the lower bound of unstable @xmath93 is zero , very long parallel wave lengths can be generated by ccoi .",
    "however , there are several limitations at small @xmath93 imposed by the finite field - aligned dimension of the system and/or time scale of system variability .",
    "the latter limitation is related to the fact that the instability growth time increases with decreasing @xmath93 and at some finite @xmath93 becomes longer than the characteristic evolution time of the system .",
    "[ f3 ]    the @xmath93 dependence of the ccoi dispersion is shown for several values of @xmath82 in fig .",

    "we fix @xmath121 at the value where the ccoi increment @xmath127 passes through the absolute maximum . at small @xmath93",
    "there is an unstable wavenumber range where the mode is aperiodically growing .",
    "the increment first increases linearly with @xmath93 , then its increase slows down and attains a maximum , and then decreases to zero . at larger @xmath93 , above this zero point ,",
    "the ccoi dispersion becomes real and describes the usual alfvn wave with frequency shifted down by the compensated - current effects ( it is shown by the solid line in fig .",

    "this especially concerns higher @xmath140 , where the increment is decreasing slowly and remains large , comparable to the maximum value @xmath139 . on the other hand ,",
    "in this high-@xmath129 range the finite gyroradius effects may become important not only for the beam , but also for the background protons .",

    "the ccoi growth rate is determined by the absolute maximum of the instability increment in the wavenumber space @xmath139 .",

    "the full normalized wavenumber @xmath162 of the most unstable perturbations generated by ccoi is shown by dotted contours .",
    "in general , the instability is stronger and generates larger wavenumbers at larger beam currents and larger thermal velocities .    the instability threshold in the @xmath163 plane is shown by the dash line , such that the range of beam currents and thermal velocities above this line is ccoi - unstable .",
    "the threshold is very close to the outer contour @xmath164 .",
    "it is seen from fig .",
    "5 that the increasing beam temperature favors the instability , making the ccoi growth rate larger and the threshold current lower . in the wide range of beam thermal velocities , @xmath165 ,",

    "namely , if the boundary in the scatter plot of measured values ( @xmath82 , @xmath147 ) can be approximated analytically as @xmath245with @xmath246 , that would suggest that the beam currents and/or temperature are regulated by ccoi .",
    "we are not aware of such correlation measurements in the terrestrial foreshock .",
    "the observed satellite - frame frequency is determined by the large doppler shift and can be estimated as @xmath247 @xmath248 @xmath249 , where @xmath250 is the angle between the solar wind speed and @xmath251 . having in mind that @xmath252 , with the same `` representative '' values as above , and @xmath253 , we obtain @xmath254 .",
    "the waves in this frequency range are regularly observed by satellites .    in the time intervals when @xmath255 , the satellite - frame frequencies of the ccoi fluctuations are determined by the ( smaller ) parallel wavenumbers and @xmath256 reduces to @xmath257 .",
    "consequently , we have another expected observational signature of ccoi : the measured wave energy in the low - frequency band @xmath258 should be larger in the cases @xmath259 than in the cases @xmath260 .",
    "we are not aware if such a trend is observed .",
    "to understand the physical nature of ccoi we note that the destabilizing term proportional to @xmath261  in the dispersion equation ( [ de ] ) comes from the product of non - diagonal elements @xmath262  and @xmath263  of the dielectric tensor ( [ e ] ) , which are dominated by the background electron current @xmath264  and the reduced beam current @xmath265:@xmath266 \\simeq i\\frac{\\omega _",

    ", we see that the fluctuating electron and beam ion currents can be expressed via fluctuating magnetic field @xmath270  as @xmath271 and @xmath272 , respectively .",
    "these first - order currents have the following simple interpretation .",
    "the frozen - in electron current , flowing along the curved field lines , @xmath273 , deviates in the @xmath270  direction thus developing a perpendicular component @xmath274 . on the contrary ,",
    "the ion beam current is partially unfrozen by the large gyroradius of the beam ions , which reduces @xmath275  by the factor @xmath118 . as a result ,",
    "even if the zero - order currents @xmath264  and @xmath276  are compensated ( @xmath277  @xmath81 ) , they induce the first - order electron  and beam ion currents  that are not compensated , @xmath278 @xmath279 .",
    "the resulting first - order net current @xmath280 makes aws aperiodically unstable .",
    "ccoi is therefore the current - driven instability in two respects : ( 1 ) the instability source is the compensated zero - order currents , which generate ( 2 ) the uncompensated first - order current @xmath281  responsible for the instability .",
    "as follows from the above explanation , the physical nature of ccoi is different from that of the fire - hose instabilities , including parallel and oblique fire - hoses driven by the effective anisotropic plasma pressure @xmath282 ( see e.g. hellinger & matsumoto , 2000 )",
    ".    given its non - resonant driving mechanism , ccoi depends on the bulk parameters of plasma species rather than on the local behavior of their velocity distributions . by using other velocity distributions instead of maxwellian",
    ", one would obtain similar results with the destabilizing factor proportional to @xmath276 , but with another demagnetization function replacing @xmath118 .",
    "the behavior of any particular demagnetization function is expected to be as regular as @xmath283 , with the same limits @xmath284  at @xmath285  and @xmath286  at @xmath287 . the instability is therefore expected to be quite robust and , contrary to the resonant current - driven instabilities , not suffering from the fast saturation by the local plateau formation in the particle velocity distributions .",
    "it is interesting to note that the growth rate of the winske - leroy instability in the well over - threshold regime ( their formula ( 16 ) ) can be expressed in terms of the beam current as @xmath288 , which is exactly the same scaling as for ccoi ( gmax ) .",
    "the same scaling suggests that both instabilities are driven by the same factor .",
    "winske & leroy have stressed that their strong non - resonant instability is not of the fire - hose type , but did not explain its physical nature . after inspecting derivations by winske & leroy ( 1983 )",
    ", we found that their most unstable regime ( equations ( 14)-(16 ) in their paper ) is indeed driven by the same factor as ccoi : the non - compensated wave currents developed in response to the compensated global currents .    a similar compensated - current instability of mhd - like modes has been found recently by bell ( 2004 , 2005 ) .",
    "the bell instability arises in response to the currents induced by cosmic rays around super - nova remnants .",
    "again , using equation ( 5 ) by bell ( 2005 ) , it is easy to see that this instability has the maximum @xmath289 , attained at @xmath290 @xmath291 .",
    "these expressions are exactly the same as for the winske - leroy instability",
    ". also , similarly to the winske - leroy instability , the bell instability maximizes at parallel propagation , @xmath292 .",
    "bell s analysis differs from winske - leroy s one in how the background plasma , beam , and unstable modes are treated .",
    "winske & leroy ( 1983 ) used a fully kinetic theory assuming a shifted maxwellian proton beam , whereas bell ( 2004 ) reduced the problem to the `` hybrid '' mhd - kinetic one ( mhd with the currents calculated kinetically ) , and used a power - law momentum distribution of the beam ions .",
    "both the winske - leroy and the bell instabilities arise because of essentially the same physical effect : suppression of the wave response to the beam ion current by the large factor @xmath293 ( parallel dispersion effect ) .",
    "the wave response to the background electron current survives such suppression because the electrons with small @xmath294 remain magnetized .",
    "this implies a physical interpretation somehow different from that proposed by bell ( 2004 , 2005 ) , who described it in terms of large ion gyroradius ( _ perpendicular _ ion scale ) . in our opinion ,",
    "the reducing factor in this case is the large _ parallel _ scale of the beam ions , @xmath295 , which defines the ion - cyclotron time - of - flight distance along the background magnetic field . if the _",
    "parallel _ wavelength is comparable or shorter than this distance , @xmath296 , the wave response to the beam current is reduced by the effective ion demagnetization .",
    "both the winske - leroy and bell instabilities are strongest at parallel propagation and are physically the same instability that can be named a compensated - current parallel instability ( ccpi ) .",
    "effects of the large ion gyroradius in the beam , which are determined by the _",
    "perpendicular _ ion motion and _ perpendicular _ wavenumber dispersion ( factor @xmath297 @xmath298 ) , are considered in the present paper . similarly to ccpi , the wave response to the beam ion current is also suppressed in ccoi , but the nature of this suppression is different .",
    "contrary to ccpi , for which the parallel dispersive effects of finite @xmath299 are important , ccoi is caused by the perpendicular dispersive effect of finite @xmath300 .",
    "consequently , ccoi develops in quite different wavenumber range characterized by large @xmath121 .",
    "concluding above comparisons , we expect several peaks in the spectrum of unstable fluctuations in the compensated - current systems with ion beams .",
    "in particular , two current - driven instabilities arise in the case of hot and fast ion beams : one at parallel propagation @xmath301 ( i.e. at @xmath292 ) for ccpi studied by winske & leroy ( 1983 ) and bell ( 2004 ) , and another at @xmath302 defined by ( [ phimax ] ) ( i.e. at @xmath303 ) for ccoi studied here . because of the same destabilizing factor @xmath82 , ccpi and ccoi have the same asymptotic scaling @xmath304 @xmath305 at large @xmath306 . however , in the cases where @xmath82 is not much larger than @xmath307 , the additional degree of freedom @xmath308 makes ccoi more flexible in finding larger growth rates as compared to ccpi .    for hot and fast ion beams ( @xmath309 ) the ion two - stream and buneman instabilities are inefficient , and",
    "the main competitors of ccoi are the mentioned above left- and right - hand polarized resonant instabilities ( gary , 1985 ) and the non - resonant instabilities studied by sentmann et al .",
    "( 1981 ) , winske & leroy ( 1983 ) , and bell ( 2004 ) .",
    "for example , from the upper curve in fig .",
    "3b by gary ( 1985 ) for the left - hand polarized instability driven by the beam @xmath310 and @xmath311 , we find the growth rate @xmath312 .",
    "for the same plasma parameters , the ccoi growth rate is somehow larger , @xmath194 .",
    "this value is also larger than that for the winske - leroy nonresonant instability at the same parameters .",
    "since the differences are not large , all these instabilities can compete in the typical foreshock conditions .    at lower beam velocities , @xmath313 , and",
    "lower beam temperatures , @xmath314 , resonant instabilities of the parallel fast and oblique alfvn modes are stronger than the parallel ones ( voitenko , 1998 ; daughton et al . 1999 ; gary et al . 2000 ; voitenko & goossens , 2003 ; verscharen & chandran , 2013 ) and can compete with ccoi .",
    "since the ccoi theory for this parameter range is not yet developed , the quantitative comparison of ccoi with these instabilities is postponed for a future study .",
    "we found a new oblique alfvnic instability , ccoi , driven by compensated currents flowing along the mean magnetic field .",
    "the instability arises on the alfvn mode dispersion branch due to the coupling to the fast mode via the current term proportional to @xmath82 .",
    "the instability is enforced by the increasing current @xmath82 and beam thermal spread @xmath315 .",
    "the physical mechanism of this instability is as follows .",
    "because of the finite ion gyroradius effects , the oblique alfvnic perturbations react differently on the current carried by the beam ions and the current carried by the electrons .",
    "namely , the wave response to the beam ion current is reduced by the averaging over the large ion gyroradius , whereas the small electron gyroradius leave the electron current response practically unaffected . ultimately , the difference between the electron and ion responses results in the net first - order current that shifts the alfvn wave frequency squared below zero making the wave aperiodically unstable .",
    "our results show that in many astrophysical and space plasma settings , comprising ion beams and return electron currents , the ccoi is a strong competitor for the ccpis studied by winske & leroy ( 1984 ) and bell ( 2004;2005 ) , as well as for the beam - driven firehose and kinetic instabilities .",
    "the threshold beam current is @xmath316 , and the instability growth rate ( maximal increment ) is @xmath317the upper bound on @xmath82 appears here because of our initial approximations , which restrict the range of tractable beam currents to @xmath318 ( this follows from the low - frequency approximation used , @xmath319 ) .",
    "the approximate expressions ( [ max ] ) are valid in the range @xmath320 , which is not empty if the beam temperature is sufficiently high to make @xmath321 .",
    "the @xmath121- dependent growth rate @xmath132 ( [ gmu ] ) is valid for stronger currents @xmath322 , but only in the wavenumber ranges where @xmath323 .",
    "the range of unstable perpendicular wavenumbers is narrow in the near - threshold regime , but expands as the beam current grows .",
    "consequently , a wide - band wave spectrum can be generated well above the threshold .",
    "an essential characteristics of the fluctuations generated by ccoi is their obliquity . in the near - threshold regime @xmath327",
    "the generated fluctuations are very oblique , @xmath328 .",
    "well above the threshold , the instability becomes less oblique and @xmath168 can drop below @xmath329 for strong enough beam currents .    such oblique fluctuations , regularly registered in the terrestrial foreshock ,",
    "can be explained by ccoi .",
    "other competing instabilities , like left-/right - hand resonant ( gary , 1985 ) , fire - hose ( sentmann et al . , 1981 ) , `` anti - parallel non - resonant '' ( winske & leroy , 1983 ) , and `` parallel non - resonant '' ( bell , 2004,2005 ) are magnetic field - aligned and hence can not explain oblique fluctuations .",
    "this research was supported by the belgian science policy office ( through prodex / cluster pea 90316 and iap programme project p7/08 charm ) , and by the european commission ( through fp7 program project 313038 storm ) ."
