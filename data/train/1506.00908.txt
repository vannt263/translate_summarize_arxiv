    "intermetallic alloys of iron and aluminum have a high hardness with a much lower specific weight than steel . because of this , their low costs , and resistance against corrosion and oxidation ,",
    "feal alloys are often used as lightweight structural materials .",
    "most puzzling are the magnetic properties . here , experiments such as high - field mssbauer investigations @xcite indicate no magnetism for stoichiometric feal which forms a @xmath2 cscl - type of lattice ( two interpenetrating fe and al simple cubic lattices ) . especially the fact that feal does not show ferromagnetism in experiment , while electronic structure calculations within spin - polarized density functional theory ( dft ) predict a ferromagnetic ground state has drawn attention to the material : independently of the bandstructure code , dft orbital basis set and exchange correlation potential a ferromagnetic ground state with a magnetic moment at the fe site of about @xmath3{\\mu_b}$ ] is found . @xcite even though the energy difference between the ferromagnetic and the nonmagnetic state is rather small , the ferromagnetic state is stable over a wide volume range .",
    "in fact , only a reduction of the lattice constant by more than 10% would suppress ferromagnetism .",
    "@xcite this high stability of the ferromagnetic phase in feal suggests that the deviation from experiment is not just a numerical inaccuracy , but requires a deeper understanding .",
    "different approaches have been used hitherto to explain the deviation between spin - polarized dft and experiment .",
    "one explanation is based on the fact that the processes used to prepare feal often `` freeze in '' chemical disorder .",
    "that is , `` real '' feal is usually not fully ordered due to various lattice defects , such as vacancies and antisites , which in turn could have a significant effect on the magnetic properties of the material . against this background ,",
    "there exist several studies concerning the effects of disorder on the magnetic properties of feal .",
    "@xcite for example , in ref .",
    "the disorder is included via the coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) @xcite in the korringa , kohn and rostoker ( kkr ) framework , @xcite with the paramagnetic phase described by the disordered local moment approximation ( dlm ) .",
    "@xcite in agreement with previous dft calculations , it has been found that ideal feal is ferromagnetic .",
    "however , even with a small degree of disorder the paramagnetic state , without net magnetization but nonzero local moments , becomes the stable configuration .",
    "thus , disorder destroys the long - range ferromagnetic order in dft .",
    "however , no ferromagnetism has ever been observed for stoichiometric `` real '' feal , even for samples with very low defect concentration .",
    "therefore , it still remains the question if perfectly ordered feal would really be ferromagnetic as predicted by dft .",
    "indeed , mssbauer experiments @xcite find magnetic moments only for fe antistructure atoms ( which means fe atoms sitting on an al lattice site ) and their eight fe neighbors .",
    "another possible explanation has been given in ref .",
    "using the dft+@xmath4 approach .",
    "@xcite usually , one would expect dft+@xmath4 to yield larger magnetic moments and a stronger tendency towards ferromagnetism than dft . for @xmath4 values ranging from @xmath5 to @xmath6{ev}$ ] a nonmagnetic state",
    "however coexists with the ferromagnetic one in dft+@xmath4 .",
    "the ferromagnetic state even disappears for a rather large @xmath7{ev}$ ] , which offers another explanation of the non - magnetic nature of feal .",
    "this rather unusual dft+@xmath4 result can be explained by the changes in the density of states ( dos ) : increasing @xmath4 reduces the dos at the fermi level so that according to the stoner criterion there is no ferromagnetism @xcite even though the effective exchange is increased by @xmath4 .",
    "@xcite hence , in a narrow range of @xmath4 , there is no ferromagnetism in dft+@xmath4 .",
    "@xcite    in ref .",
    "it has been argued that this dft+@xmath4 result has to be taken with a grain of salt and it has been proposed for the first time that dynamical spin fluctuations suppress ferromagnetism in feal .",
    "this has been supported by a dynamical mean field theory ( dmft@xcite ) calculation.@xcite for @xmath8{ev}$ ] , feal is found@xcite to be paramagnetic in dft+dmft.@xcite however , ref .   only shows a single dft+dmft result , the spectral function .",
    "the proposed spin fluctuations , the magnetic properties and susceptibility have not been calculated .",
    "considering these limited results as well as the improvements of dft+dmft in recent years , a more thorough analysis is in order . beyond the first dft+dmft spectrum of ref .  , we study the local and bulk magnetic susceptibility , the magnetic moment and the @xmath9-resolved spectrum .",
    "we also explicitly calculate the local interactions _ ab - initio _ by constrained random phase approximation ( crpa ) and beyond ref .",
    "we include the calculated hund s exchange in dmft with its full @xmath10 symmetry , since it plays a pivotal role for the magnetic properties .",
    "our results show that while there is a local moment of even @xmath1{\\mu_b}$ ] on short time scales , it is screened ( suppressed ) on longer time scales .",
    "this suppression of the local moment occurs on the fs time scale ( ev@xmath11 ) and explains why there is eventually no long - range ferromagnetic order .    in section [ sec : escdft ] we present the dft bandstructure and dos as well as the wannier function projection .",
    "section [ sec : dmftself ] is devoted to the one - particle properties as calculated in dft+dmft , i.e. , the self - energy as well as the local and @xmath9-resolved spectral function .",
    "the dft+dmft magnetic properties are discussed in section [ sec : dmftmag ] , i.e. , the local and ( zero ) ferromagnetic moment as well as the time - dependent local susceptibility and bulk susceptibility .",
    "finally , section [ sec : conclusion ] summarizes the results and puts them into context with experiment .",
    "as a first step , we employ the vienna ab initio simulation package ( vasp ) @xcite with gga - pbe functional @xcite for calculating the bandstructure and density of states of feal .",
    "[ fig : bands_vasp ] shows the bandstructure of feal around the fermi level .",
    "the bands closest to the fermi level have mainly fe 3@xmath12 character and are split into @xmath13 and @xmath14 due to the cubic crystal field .",
    "for these bands we will later include electronic correlations by dmft .",
    "however , since the fe 3@xmath12 bands strongly hybridize with the al 3@xmath15 and 3@xmath16 states , we also include these al bands ( as non - interacting ) in our low energy hamiltonian .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian is obtained by a projection onto nine maximally localized wannier orbitals @xcite , which reproduce the dft bandstructure well , see fig .",

    "it can be seen that the central peak is mainly of @xmath13 character . as the fe @xmath13",
    "orbitals form only weak bonds with the nearest - neighbor al atoms , they have a rather small energy dispersion .",
    "the fe @xmath14 states instead point towards the neighboring fe atoms and hybridize more strongly .",
    "hence they have a larger bandwidth and split into a bonding- and an antibonding - like part .",
    "after obtaining the low energy hamiltonian in the basis of wannier functions , we perform dmft calculations including the five fe @xmath12 orbitals and the 4 al @xmath17 orbitals within a so - called @xmath18 model.@xcite we supplement the dft - based wannier hamiltonian in dmft by a local @xmath12-@xmath12 kanamori interaction , but disregard @xmath12-@xmath16 and @xmath16-@xmath16 interactions beyond what is already contained in dft . note that the hopping terms of the hamiltonian still contain the full information about the hybridization with the al @xmath17 states and charge transfer between @xmath12 and @xmath17 orbitals is allowed .",

    "there is no evidence of pronounced upper and lower hubbard bands and one can only observe a weak increase of the spectral weight at high frequencies . in agreement with ref .  , we find that the spectral function at the fermi level is essentially the same in dft+dmft as in dft .",

    "if hund s exchange was the major player , on the other hand , one would expect a stronger coupling of @xmath14 and @xmath13 susceptibility , and a decay on a similar time scale .",
    "this all suggests that the hund s rule exchange @xmath20 , which mainly drives the inter - orbital contribution , is not exceedingly important in feal .",

    "@xcite hence , the unusual low-@xmath85 reduction of @xmath79 has been attributed to specific features of the one - particle spectral function of lafeaso , displaying significant temperature variations near the fermi level . by performing the same analysis for feal",
    "we find , however , that the low-@xmath85 behavior of @xmath86 ( inset of fig .",

    "a slight reduction of the instantaneous local moment ( @xmath88 , inset ) is also found , which is a typical behavior in the fermi liquid regime , as described by the dmft .",

    "this explains why we also do not find long - range ferromagnetic order .",
    "according to our dft+dmft study , feal is paramagnetic with a maximum in the ferromagnetic susceptibility around room temperature and no tendency towards long range magnetic order in the temperature range studied .",
