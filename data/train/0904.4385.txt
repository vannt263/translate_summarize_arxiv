    "single - molecule junctions based on direct bonding of a small molecule between two metallic electrodes seem by now rather established experimentally .",
    "@xcite the electronic transport through such a molecular bridge is attracting a great deal of interest , including the invention of ingenious experimental realizations for it ( see , for example , the recent refs .  ) .",
    "besides the possible technological advantages of  molecular electronics \" @xcite , there are many issues that make this problem of great interest from both the basic science and the application points of view .",
    "the possibility of directly addressing a _ single _ microscopic quantum system with an ordinary measurement apparatus should shed light on fundamental quantum measurement questions .",
    "electrons passing through the small molecule may change its quantum state ( electronic , vibrational , and in certain cases also rotational , and even the conformation @xcite of the molecule ) .",
    "these may require a finite energy transfer from the transport electron .",
    "thus , the dynamics of the molecule may create interesting structures in the i - v characteristics .",
    "@xcite these rich characteristics , resembling the one observed in inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy ( iets ) , @xcite depend on important experimental details such as the equilibration time of the vibrations compared to the typical time between consecutive electrons passing through the junction , or whether the electrons can pump the molecule into higher vibrational states .",
    "such measurements provide a handle on studying molecular properties and their modifications by the binding to the electrodes . in some cases they may also help to identify the molecule which has been bound in the bridge .    the configurational modification of the molecule by the tunneling electron is usually described by a linear coupling of the electron with e.g. the vibrational modes , while the oscillating location of the whole molecule is modeled by the dependence of the tunneling matrix elements to the leads on the vibrational degrees of freedom .",
    "@xcite as is well - known , one may eliminate the linear electron - phonon interaction by a canonical transformation which dresses the tunneling matrix elements by the phonon cloud ( the holstein polaron @xcite ) .",
    "the resulting matrix elements contain the franck - condon factors .",
    "these tend to block the conductance at off - resonant situations ( the franck - condon blockade ) .",
    "@xcite however , the top of the resonance conductance is not reduced by these factors .",
    "@xcite indeed , we find that the coupling to the vibrational mode causes a narrowing of the resonance .",
    "this narrowing is described by the ` usual ' franck - condon blockade only in the limit of very narrow ` bare ' resonances , namely very long dwell times of the electrons on the resonances .",
    "we find that reducing this dwell time weakens the franck - condon blocking .",
    "transport through small molecules offers new means of studying tunneling of electrons interacting with vibrational modes .",
    "theoretical studies of the coupling between molecular vibrations and electronic states participating in the tunneling have begun with the exact calculation of the single - electron transmission , in which the presence of the fermi seas representing the leads has been essentially ignored .",
    "@xcite the single - electron transmission naturally exhibits resonances at energies corresponding to the vibration frequencies ( these are often called  side - bands \" ) .",
    "such side - bands also appear in the local ( on - molecule ) single - particle density of states , computed in the presence of the leads .",
    "@xcite there are claims in the literature @xcite that these side - bands are reflected in , for example , the gate - potential dependence of the linear - response conductance .",
    "however , as has been emphasized by mitra _",
    "_ @xcite and discussed in detail below , such side - bands can not appear at zero temperature in the linear - response regime .",
    "we shall demonstrate their appearance , albeit weakly , at finite temperatures .    indeed , an electron crossing the molecular bridge may do so inelastically or elastically ( with or without changing the excitation state of the molecule ) . in the former case",
    "the electron will lose its phase coherence  a problem to which we will return in future work ( see the discussion in ref .  ) . here , we concentrate on the structure of the conductance as a function of the bias voltage @xmath2 and the gate potential , represented by the electrochemical potential @xmath3 ( when applying the latter is feasible ) .",
    "clearly , at low temperatures only elastic processes and inelastic ones _ exciting _ the molecule are possible .",
    "the latter can happen only if the transmitted electron can supply the energy required for the molecular excitation .",
    "focussing on a molecular vibration of frequency @xmath4 , it is clear , then , that it can be excited only when the bias voltage @xmath2 exceeds @xmath5 , namely , beyond the linear - response regime .",
    "this @xcite will be confirmed by the detailed calculations below .",
    "the footprints of the inelastic processes appear in the differential conductance when plotted as a function of the bias voltage .",
    "( for analyses of the full counting statistics of a vibrating junction , see refs .  .",
    ") this regime has been studied experimentally rather intensively .",
    "theoretically , it has been treated by employing a variety of methods and numerical techniques .",
    "@xcite at low temperatures , the inelastic channel comes in when the bias voltage exceeds @xmath6 .",
    "this however does not necessarily imply an increase of the total conductance , since the elastic conduction channel might be modified as well .",
    "indeed , interestingly enough , it has been observed that the  step \" in the conductance at @xmath7 appears either as a decrease or an increase in the differential conductance .",
    "@xcite theoretical work addressing this issue @xcite claimed that this behavior depends in a universal manner on the bare elastic transparency of the junction , @xmath8 , such that the differential conductance steps upwards when @xmath9 , and downwards when @xmath10 .",
    "this claim has been refuted recently in a seminal paper by egger and gogolin . @xcite",
    "we confirm their conclusion .",
    "moreover , we find that the conductance steps downwards only in a narrow range of @xmath8 , which becomes narrower as the ratio of the excitation energy @xmath11 to the bare resonance width @xmath12 increases .",
    "another important aspect concerns the instabilities in the vibration modes possibly induced by the current .",
    "@xcite in particular , ref .",
    "points out the inapplicability of the perturbation theory in the electron - vibration coupling once the nonequilibrium regime is reached .",
    "we show below that the step - like structure in the differential conductance at @xmath7 implies another type of breakdown of the perturbation theory .",
    "it turns out that the opening of the inelastic channel is inevitably accompanied by the appearance of _ logarithmic singularities _ at the same bias voltage .",
    "those are forced via the kramers - kronig relations and are related to the singularities found by engelsberg and schrieffer @xcite for bulk einstein phonons . in this way we confirm the important ( and seemingly , un - noticed ) result of mitra _",
    "_ @xcite and egger and gogolin @xcite : beside the step - like structure , caused by the inelastic tunneling processes , the differential conductance develops a logarithmic singularity ( at zero temperature , and to second order in the electron - vibration coupling ) as the bias voltage crosses the vibration energy . near the threshold voltage @xmath7 , that singularity dominates the differential conductance .",
    "it thus seems that there are several relevant issues in the theory of transport through a vibrating junction which are either still under debate or are not entirely clear .",
    "these concern the existence of side - bands , the dependence of the conductance on the junction transparency , the structure of the differential conductance near the opening of the inelastic channel , and the precise effect of the franck - condon factors on the resonances , including what happens when the resonance width exceeds the vibration frequency .",
    "below , we give our answers to these questions and provide further physical interpretations for them . in order not to obscure the basic physics by lengthy computations ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to the simplest model , of a single resonance connected symmetrically to two leads and coupled linearly to a vibration .",
    "in addition , we apply lowest - order perturbation theory in the electron - vibration coupling .",
    "we believe that a complete analytical discussion of the outcome of this model will shed further light on the intriguing non - equilibrium behavior of the vibration - induced conductance .",
    "section [ model ] gives the hamiltonian , and then expresses the current through the system in terms of the green functions , which contain the contributions from the coupling to the vibrational mode .",
    "the detailed calculation of these green functions is described in the appendix .",
    "section [ lr ] presents the results for the conductance and for the density of states in the linear - response regime , while sec .",
