    "the solidification of a liquid or the melting of a solid lead to complex free boundary problems involving many different physical effects .",
    "for example , latent heat is set free at the interface and a competition between surface energy and diffusion leads to instabilities like the mullins  sekerka instability .",
    "the resulting model is a stefan problem with boundary conditions taking surface energy effects and kinetic effects at the interface into account , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "crystals forming in an undercooled melt lead to very complex patterns and , in particular , dendritic growth can be observed since the growth is typically diffusion limited , see @xcite .",
    "the numerical simulation of time - dependent stefan problems , or variants of it , is a formidable task since the evolving free boundary has to be computed .",
    "hence , direct front tracking type numerical methods need to adequately capture the geometry of the interface and to evolve the interface approximation , often with a coupling to other physical fields . this coupling , in particular , represents a significant initial hurdle towards obtaining practical implementations , and thus numerical simulations for the problem at hand .",
    "examples of the implementation of such direct methods can be found in e.g.   @xcite .",
    "a further drawback of direct front tracking methods has been the inability of most direct methods to deal with so - called mesh effects , or to prevent them altogether .",
    "when a discrete approximation of an interface , for example a polygonal curve in the plane , evolves in time , then in general it is possible for the approximation to deteriorate or to break down .",
    "examples of such pathologies are self - crossings and vertex coalescence . while for simple isotropic problems in the plane these issues can be dealt with , for example by frequent remeshings or by using clever formulations that only allow equidistributed approximations , see e.g.  @xcite , until very recently there has been no remedy for fully anisotropic problems in two and three space dimensions .",
    "however , building on their work for isotropic problems in @xcite , the present authors recently introduced stable parametric finite element schemes for the direct approximation of anisotropic geometric evolution equations in @xcite , for which good mesh properties can be guaranteed . in particular , even for the simulation of interface evolutions in the presence of strong anisotropies , no remeshing or redistribution of vertices is needed in practice .",
    "these schemes , in which only the interface without a coupling to bulk quantities is modelled , have been extended to approximations of the stefan problem with fully anisotropic gibbs  thomson law and kinetic undercooling in @xcite .",
    "the novel method from @xcite can be shown to be stable and to have good mesh properties .",
    "we remark that these approaches extend earlier ideas from @xcite . here",
    "we recall the pioneering work of schmidt @xcite , where the full stefan problem in three dimensions was solved within a sharp interface framework for the first time .",
    "phase field methods are an alternative approach to solve solidification phenomena in the framework of continuum modelling . in phase field",
    "approaches a new non - conserved order parameter @xmath0 is introduced , which in the two phases is close to two different prescribed values and which smoothly changes its value across a small diffuse interfacial region . a parabolic partial differential equation for @xmath0",
    "is then coupled to an energy balance , which results in a diffusion equation for the temperature taking latent heat effects into account .",
    "we refer to @xcite and to the five review articles @xcite for further details .",
    "in particular , it can be shown that solutions to the phase field equations converge to classical sharp interface problems , see e.g.   @xcite and the references therein .",
    "the popularity of phase field methods , often also called diffuse interface methods , can be explained by two characteristic features that they share with the level set method , which is another sharp interface computational tool .",
    "firstly , phase field methods naturally allow for changes of topology . and",
    "secondly , computing simulations for phase field models only requires the solution of partial differential equations on standard cartesian domains .",
    "the fact that these can usually be implemented and solved in a relatively straightforward way makes the phase field method particularly appealing .",
    "it is the aim of this article to investigate the practical merits of phase field models compared to the recently introduced sharp interface algorithm for the approximation of stefan problems from @xcite ; see also @xcite .",
    "of particular interest will be the relative accuracy of the two methods , in situations where a true solution to the sharp interface problem is known .",
    "in a phase field simulation the observed error is made up of contributions from    * the asymptotic error , * the spatial and temporal discretization errors , * rounding errors and solver tolerances .    here",
    "the asymptotic error is induced by the choice of interfacial parameter @xmath1 . in general one",
    "can formally show that the asymptotic error converges to zero as @xmath2 , see e.g.  @xcite . for certain phase field models and under certain conditions",
    "it can be rigorously shown that the asymptotic error vanishes as @xmath3 , see e.g.  @xcite . in computations for sharp interface approximations , on the other hand ,",
    "the observed error is made up of the latter two contributions only , i.e.  of discretization and rounding errors .",
    "a disadvantage of phase field models is that the resulting pdes become stiff for decreasing @xmath4 , leading to a requirement for very fine spatial and temporal discretizations .",
    "hence it becomes computationally challenging to produce very accurate phase field simulations . in any case",
    ", the available computational resources will often set a limit on the smallest interfacial parameter @xmath4 that one can compute for .",
    "hence another aspect that needs to be taken into account in an objective comparison between phase field simulations and sharp interface approximations is the overall cpu time that is needed to obtain the results .",
    "while it can often be formally shown that phase field computations can attain an arbitrarily high accuracy , the existing limitations on computer hardware often mean that in practice very fine computations can not be performed .",
    "in addition , as discussed in @xcite , the early computational approaches were limited as they could only be used in the presence of interfacial kinetics in the gibbs  thomson law .",
    "historically these limitations of the phase field model have long been known , and as a result a different underlying interpretation of the model , the so - called `` thin interface limit '' , has been introduced and analyzed by karma and rappel @xcite .",
    "their approach made it possible to do efficient computations with a smaller capillary length to interface thickness ratio , and to study the physically relevant case of small or zero kinetic coefficients .",
    "later the findings of karma and rappel were reinterpreted as second order convergence with respect to the interfacial thickness , see @xcite .",
    "the first successful phase field computations of dendritic growth were performed by kobayashi @xcite , and his computations demonstrated the importance of anisotropy for dendritic growth . since then many successful improvements with respect to numerical simulations have appeared in the literature .",
    "we refer to @xcite and the references therein .",
    "finally , we would like to mention work on the numerical analysis of phase field and sharp interface approaches .",
    "numerical analysis of discretizations of phase field models can be found in e.g.@xcite .",
    "numerical analysis of discretizations of sharp interface models can be found in @xcite .",
    "we also remark that level set methods are another possible way to solve stefan problems and related free boundary problems .",
    "we refer to @xcite for more details on how the level set method can be used to solve free boundary problems .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec:2 ]",
    "we state the sharp interface formulation of the two phase stefan problem with kinetic undercooling and an anisotropic gibbs  thomson law . in section",
    "[ sec:3 ] we state the corresponding phase field model and recall the finite element algorithms from @xcite . in section  [ sec:4 ] we numerically compare the sharp interface method from @xcite with the phase field algorithms from section  [ sec:3 ] for some isotropic benchmark problems with known true solutions . computations for a phase field model with a correction term , for which a second order convergence property can formally be shown , are presented in section  [ sec:43 ] .",
    "finally , we compare the sharp interface and phase field methods for a variety of anisotropic model problems in section  [ sec:5 ] .",
    "in this paper we concentrate on interfacial problems in materials science in which one driving force is due to capillary effects . in applications",
    "the interface often separates a solid and a liquid phase , say , or a solid phase and a gas phase .",
    "let @xmath5 , @xmath6 , denote this sharp interface .",
    "then the surface energy of @xmath7 is defined as @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes the unit normal of @xmath7 , and where the anisotropic density function @xmath10 with @xmath11 is assumed to be absolutely homogeneous of degree one , i.e.@xmath12 with @xmath13 denoting the gradient of @xmath14 .",
    "for all the considerations in this paper we assume that @xmath14 is of the class of anisotropies first introduced by the authors in @xcite ; see also @xcite .",

    "we remark that a derivation from thermodynamics would lead to the identity @xmath59 .",
    "we note that ( [ eq:1b ] ) is the well - known stefan condition , while ( [ eq:1c ] ) is the gibbs  thomson condition , with kinetic undercooling if @xmath60 .",
    "the case @xmath61 , @xmath60 , @xmath62 leads to the stefan problem with the gibbs  thomson law and kinetic undercooling . in some models in the literature ,",
    "see e.g.  @xcite , the kinetic undercooling is set to zero , i.e.  @xmath63 . setting @xmath64 but keeping @xmath41 leads to the mullins  sekerka problem with the gibbs  thomson law ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "we recall from @xcite that for a solution @xmath29 and @xmath18 to ( [ eq:1a]e ) it can be shown that the following equality holds @xmath65 where @xmath66 and where @xmath67 denotes the @xmath68inner product over @xmath35 , with the corresponding norm given by @xmath69 , and where @xmath70 .",
    "traditional front tracking methods for sharp interface problems had a major drawback , in that the meshes used to describe the interface seriously deteriorated during the evolution .",
    "in addition , introducing mesh smoothing during the evolution is difficult , see e.g.  the discussion in @xcite . for interfaces in the plane it is possible to formulate a non - trivial method",
    "such that mesh points are nearly equally distributed during the evolution , see @xcite .",
    "the present authors introduced a novel parametric finite element method for problems involving curves and surfaces evolving in time , which has a simple variational structure and which leads to good mesh properties , see @xcite .",
    "in fact , for curves a semi - discrete variant leads to equally distributed mesh points in the isotropic case , while in the general anisotropic setting equidistribution with respect to some anisotropic weight function is obtained , see @xcite . for surfaces",
    "the resulting meshes have also good properties , which in the isotropic case can be explained by using ideas from conformal geometry . in particular , no remeshing is needed during the evolution , even in the general anisotropic situation .",
    "an example triangulation obtained during the simulation of dendritic growth in three space dimensions can be seen in figure  [ fig : mesh ] , below .",
    "in addition , as the mesh for the parameterization of the interface is decoupled from the bulk mesh , no deformation of the bulk mesh is required in order to contain the interface at predefined locations on it .",
    "the novel and stable parametric finite element approximation of ( [ eq:1a]e ) in the case @xmath71 has been introduced by the present authors in @xcite , and this scheme has been extended to the more general case @xmath72 in @xcite . throughout this paper",
    "we will refer to these variants as pfem .",

    "@xmath73 refers to the fineness of the triangulated approximation of @xmath7 , for which isoparametric piecewise linear finite elements are employed .",
    "in particular , a simple mesh refinement strategy allows for the natural growth of the interface , i.e.  elements of the triangulated approximation of @xmath7 are refined when they become too large .",
    "moreover , the temperature in the bulk is approximated with standard continuous piecewise linear finite elements , and @xmath74 and @xmath75 refer to bulk mesh parameters for fine regions close to the interface and coarser regions far away from it .",
    "for all the computations presented in this paper we fix @xmath77 and , unless stated otherwise , we let @xmath78 . finally , @xmath76 denotes a uniform time step size .",
    "the linear discrete systems of equations are solved with preconditioned conjugate gradient solvers of suitable schur complement formulations .",
    "we refer to @xcite for more details .",
    "as indicated earlier , no remeshing of the discrete interface is necessary for the scheme pfem , and all the numerical results presented in this paper for this scheme are performed without any redistribution of mesh points .",
    "we now state the phase field model that we are going to consider in this paper . to this end , for @xmath79 , let @xmath80 and define @xmath81 where @xmath82 is a constant satisfying @xmath83 .",
    "moreover , let @xmath84 be the phase field variable , so that the sets @xmath85 are approximations to @xmath86 , with the zero level set of @xmath87 approximating the interface @xmath7 . on introducing the small interfacial parameter @xmath1 , it can be shown that @xmath88 for @xmath4 sufficiently small , where @xmath89 here @xmath90 $ ] is a double well potential , which we assume to be symmetric and to have its global minima at @xmath91 .",

    "these authors also show convergence of the phase field discretizations to the underlying sharp interface problem as @xmath115 , where @xmath116 and @xmath76 denote the discretization parameters in space and time , respectively . however , to our knowledge",
