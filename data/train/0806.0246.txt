    "great advances in nanotechnology over the past few years led to the fabrication and intense experimental study of low - dimensional electron systems ( quantum dots and wires ) . from a long - term perspective ,",
    "such systems are of interest as they give insight into the physics of more complicated nanodevices needed for quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "the smallness of quantum dots leads to fairly large energy level spacings and at sufficiently low temperatures only a few levels are relevant for the description of the physics .",
    "the latter is then strongly affected by the repulsive interaction between the electrons , manifesting e.g.  in coulomb blockade behavior @xcite or kondo screening @xcite .",
    "the physics of quantum wires is described by the luttinger rather than the fermi liquid theory , in clear contrast to most bulk materials where the effects of coulomb correlations do not extend beyond mild renormalization of fermi liquid parameters . @xcite .    from the theoretical point of view , a many - particle method is needed to properly account for the electron - electron interaction @xmath0 , which is a vital ingredient to any model one might devise to describe the experimental setups . a perturbative approach works in some cases , but it fails to describe strong correlations ( such as kondo physics @xcite ) . moreover , it breaks down completely for certain classes of low - dimensional systems because of infrared divergences in low - order feynman diagrams @xcite .",
    "the latter motivates the application of renormalization group ( rg ) based methods which successively address all energy scales of the system , starting from high energies where infrared singularities are cut out .",
    "one particular implementation of wilson s general rg idea @xcite is the numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) , which was originally developed to address the kondo model @xcite but later on applied to various kinds of quantum impurity systems @xcite .",
    "it provides a very reliable tool to investigate physical properties of models with coulomb interaction at low energies .",
    "however , its applicability is practically limited to small systems with a few correlated degrees of freedom because of the computational resources required .",
    "a different rg based approach to solve the quantum many - particle problem is the functional renormalization group ( frg ) which exactly describes all vertex functions of the corresponding system in terms of an infinite hierarchy of coupled flow equations @xcite . in practice",
    ", this hierarchy needs to be truncated ( usually by neglecting the flow of the three - particle vertex ) , rendering frg an approximate method .",
    "moreover , in the context of quantum dots and wires the frequency dependence of the flowing two - particle vertex was discarded , alltogether resulting in a closed finite set of coupled differential equations whose numerical solution gives renormalized frequency - independent system parameters embodying the effects of the two - particle interaction @xcite .",
    "this approximation scheme was successfully applied to describe luttinger liquid behavior of one - dimensional quantum wires with local inhomogeneities @xcite , whereas ordinary perturbation theory in the two - particle interaction @xmath0 is plagued by infrared singularities .",
    "in contrast , perturbation theory is usually regular for quantum dot models ( such as the single impurity anderson model ) and there is no inherent need for an rg based framework .",
    "however , the appearance of the exponentially ( in @xmath0 ) small kondo energy scale @xmath1 motivates rg resummations of certain classes of diagrams .",
    "the application of the frequency - independent functional renormalization group to single- as well as multi - level spinful and spin - polarized quantum dot geometries turned out to give surprisingly good results in the strong coupling limit , even though the approximation can a priori be justified only for small to intermediate @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the most striking observation is that the frg describes aspects of kondo physics ( e.g. , an exponential energy scale ) contained within the single impurity anderson model ( siam ) very accurately @xcite .",
    "the frequency - independent approximation can thus be viewed as a kind of rg - enhanced hartree - fock theory which does not suffer from typical mean - field artifacts ( such as the breaking of spin symmetry ) .    by construction , a truncation procedure which disregards all frequency dependencies",
    "can not be expected to give reliable results for finite - energy properties .",
    "indeed , the siam linear - response conductance at zero temperature @xmath2 ( which is a zero - energy quantity ) is described well by this level of approximation @xcite , whereas the conductance at @xmath3 ( which is a finite - energy property ) is not .",
    "in addition , finite energy effects become important if one is interested in extending the method to the non - equilibrium situation .",
    "it is thus very reasonable to devise a truncation procedure which includes the frequency - dependence of the two - particle vertex in order to describe finite - energy properties . a first step in this direction",
    "was done in ref .",
    "@xcite where results for the siam were presented , illustrating that such a generalization is in principle possible @xcite .",
    "however , there was no systematic study of all system parameters ( in particular finite temperatures and finite magnetic fields ) and the question whether strong - coupling physics is captured ( as it is partially by the frequency - independent approximation ) was not answered conclusively .",
    "finally , technical details about how the flow equations are actually implemented numerically were not elaborated on .",
    "it is the first goal of this paper to systematically study the siam using a frequency - dependent frg scheme , benchmarking this approximation against data we obtain from the numerical rg framework .",
    "the second objective is to present technical details of this generalization in order to address the issue of numerical artifacts originating from the discretization of the matsubara frequency axis .",
    "even though little is to be learned about the physics , we think that systematically discussing the details of this very natural and obvious generalization of a frequency - independent frg truncation scheme in its application to the siam is of importance , particularly if one aims at treating more complex ( multi - level or multi - impurity ) quantum dot systems . in short , the strong - coupling behavior extracted from the frg approximation",
    "turns out to be worse than one might have expected , particularly if one has in mind the success of the frequency - independent approach .",
    "however , at small to intermediate @xmath4 ( @xmath5 being the impurity - lead hybridization ) the agreement with nrg reference data improves if the more elaborate finite - frequency frg scheme is employed .",
    "the same holds if the two - particle vertex is parametrized not by three independent energy variables but ( numerically far less demanding ) by three functions each depending on a single argument . since the computational effort in solving the flow equations grows only as a power law ( and not exponentially ) with the number of impurities and channels and since there is no numerical need to stick to special ( symmetric ) system parameters , the frequency - dependent frg approximation presented in this paper can be regarded as a fast and reliable tool to describe the small- to intermediate - coupling physics of correlated quantum dot models which can not be treated using the nrg .",
