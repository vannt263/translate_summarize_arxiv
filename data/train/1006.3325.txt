    "electron - nucleon deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) has played an important role in our understanding of the strong interactions . by now , it is a standard topic in particle physics and quantum field theory books @xcite .    the cross section for this process can be written in term of two structure functions .",
    "these obey a factorization formula ( see for example @xcite ) @xmath0    the parton distribution function ( pdf ) @xmath1 is often referred to as the  probability to find a parton @xmath2 in hadron @xmath3 \" . such a description , although very intuitive , requires a field theoretic definition .",
    "what do we mean by a  distribution function \" ?",
    "this question was answered in the early 1980 s @xcite .",
    "the quark pdf is @xmath4 where @xmath5 light - like vector , @xmath6 and @xmath7 is a light - like wilson line , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , with @xmath10 in the fundamental representation .",
    "let us discuss ( [ pdfdef ] ) in more detail .",
    "first , in the definition of the pdf , an average over color and spin is understood .",
    "second , since @xmath11 and @xmath12 are not at the same point , we must include a `` gauge - link '' to render the operator gauge invariant .",
    "this is the reason that the wilson lines appear in the definition of the pdf .",
    "notice that the product of the two semi - infinite wilson lines can be written as finite wilson line connecting the point @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "third , the pdf is just the fourier transform of the diagonal matrix element of a standard dimension - three operator .",
    "since the operator is non - local , its fourier transform is a function and not a number .",
    "fourth , the anti - quark pdf and gluon pdf can be defined in a similar way to the quark pdf .",
    "for example , the gluon pdf is defined with the quark field replaced by gluon field strength and the wilson line is in the adjoint representation .",
    "for concreteness in the following we will focus on the quark pdf .",
    "the pdf satisfies the dglap ( dokshitzer - gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi ) equation @xmath15 where @xmath16 are the so called  splitting functions \" .",
    "these are usually calculated via two main methods .",
    "the first is based on the interpretation of the splitting function as the `` probability '' of the quark to `` split '' into a quark and a gluon @xcite . at @xmath17 one finds @xmath18 where @xmath19 for qcd .",
    "the full expression is in fact @xmath20 + { \\cal o}(\\alpha^2_s)\\equiv \\frac{c_f\\alpha_s}{\\pi}p^{[0]}_{qq}+{\\cal o}(\\alpha^2_s).\\ ] ] and the singular terms @xmath21 , defined in the appendix , and @xmath22 must be added  by hand \" .",
    "the second method , often called the `` ope '' method @xcite , is based on the fact that moments of the pdf are matrix elements of local operators .",
    "thus one defines the moments @xmath23 which satisfy a local renormalization group equation ( rge ) @xmath24 the splitting function is related to @xmath25 via @xmath26    there is also another approach possible , which is less known , and can be described as the `` effective field theory '' method . going back to the factorization formula for @xmath27 ,",
    "we can write it schematically as @xmath28 the factorization formula can be interpreted as a result of matching qcd onto an effective field theory .",
    "@xmath29 is the wilson coefficient extracted in the process , and the pdf is the matrix element of the operator in the effective theory .",
    "the `` power corrections '' correspond to the contribution of power suppressed operators .",
    "this is the standard expression one finds in a generic effective field theory approach .",
    "the only complication in this case is the non - locality of the operator .",
    "the scale @xmath30 on which the pdf depends is then just the cut - off scale of the effective theory .",
    "it is not surprising then that the cut - off dependence of the pdf is determined by an rge which is schematically    @xmath31    this is none other than the famous dglap equation , where the splitting function is simply the anomalous dimension .",
    "since the pdf is a function , the anomalous dimension is a function too , and not a constant .",
    "if the splitting function is just the anomalous dimension of the pdf , one can calculate it as one usually does in field theory . in particular , if we use dimensional regularization and a mass independent scheme , the anomalous dimension can be extracted from the @xmath32 pole of the loop corrections to the pdf .",
    "the only unusual aspect of the calculation arises from the non - local structure of the pdf .",
    "we will discuss this calculation in detail in the next section .",
    "this calculation was first performed , to the best of our knowledge , by braunschweig , horejsi and robaschik @xcite .",
    "but their paper is almost unknown . by the end of 2009 it had 5 citations on spires @xcite . for comparison , by the end of 2009 reference",
    "@xcite had 3933 citations while references @xcite and @xcite had 589 and 919 citations , respectively .",
    "the situation is slightly better then these citation counts indicate , but still the third approach is much less known , especially to the general high energy community .    the effective field theory approach has received much interest in the recent years , since the effective field theory one is matching onto is the soft collinear effective theory ( scet ) @xcite .",
    "calculations of the anomalous dimension of non - local operators are standard in scet .",
    "the application of scet to dis , as well as other hard qcd processes , was first discussed in @xcite . in that paper",
    "the matching coefficients were calculated at tree level . although scet is the appropriate eft for dis , the effect of the soft gluons completely cancel for generic @xmath33 @xcite . in this case",
    "scet is just `` boosted qcd '' and we can calculate the anomalous dimension by using qcd feynman rules instead of scet feynman rules .",
    "we will demonstrate this approach by calculating @xmath34 for the non - singlet case .",
    "the method will be technically different from @xcite , but conceptually very similar .",
    "for another pedagogical discussion of the calculation of the evolution ( rge ) equations for non - local operators see appendix g of @xcite , where the calculation techniques are demonstrated for both covariant and light - cone gauges .",
    "we begin by deriving the feynman rules . we will use the definition of the pdf in equation ( [ pdfdef ] ) , and replace the hadron state by a free quark .",
    "since we are interested in the cut - off ( uv ) dependence of the pdf which is independent of the ir physics , such a replacement is justified .",
    "the `` zero - gluon '' feynman rule is    @xmath35    taking the external states to carry momentum @xmath36 we find that the zeroth order expression is @xmath37 averaging over the spins we would find @xmath38 , i.e. the quark is carrying all of the momentum of the hadron .",
    "the zero - gluon feynman rule is therefore @xmath39    in order to find the one - gluon feynman rule we need to expand the wilson lines in ( [ wilson ] ) .",
    "a simple calculation yields @xmath40\\,\\frac{\\nslash}{2}\\ ] ]      in order to find @xmath34 we need to calculate three diagrams , see figure [ fd ] . to demonstrate the techniques",
    ", we will calculate the leftmost diagram in figure [ fd ] .",
    "we will use feynman gauge in the calculation .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     first we need to define light - cone coordinates .",
    "we define two light - cone vectors @xmath41 .",
    "in particular we will use @xmath42 .",
    "notice that @xmath43 .",
    "any four vector can be decomposed as @xmath44 which also defines the `` @xmath45 '' coordinates . in these coordinates",
    "@xmath46 can be written as @xmath47 we can now write down the feynman integral , @xmath48 ^ 2\\frac{\\rm num.}{(k - p)^2+i0 } \\,\\delta(\\xi\\ , n\\cdot p - n\\cdot k),\\ ] ] where @xmath36 ( @xmath49 ) is the external ( internal ) quark momentum and @xmath50    the total diagram is given by @xmath51    the only difference from the usual feynman integral is the presence of the delta function",
    ". it also forces us to split the integration according to the light - cone coordinates .",
    "our strategy will be to calculate the @xmath52 integral using residue theorem , to calculate the @xmath53 integral in @xmath54 dimensions , and use the delta function to perform the integral over @xmath55 @xcite .    in order to use the residue theorem for the @xmath52 integral",
    "we need to find the poles of the integrand .",
    "they are given by @xmath56 in order to get a non - zero result we must ensure that the two poles are on the opposite sides of the real @xmath52 axis . otherwise we can close the contour in the half plane that contains no poles and get zero .",
    "there are two options then , @xmath57 recall , though , that @xmath58 , so the second option is ruled out .",
    "combining the first option with the delta function @xmath59 we find that @xmath60 .",
    "notice also that we have recovered the usual support property of @xmath61 , namely , that the momentum fraction carried by the quark must be between 0 and 1 .    after performing the @xmath55 integral using residues",
    ", we perform the integral over @xmath53 using dimensional regularization in @xmath54 dimensions . due to the numerator structure ,",
    "we can split @xmath62 into 3 integrals that differ by their dirac structure . in order to find the anomalous dimension we only need the dirac structure that appear in the definition of @xmath61 ,",
    "i.e @xmath63 .",
    "the other dirac structures lead to finite terms and do not contribute to the anomalous dimension.[multiblock footnote omitted ]    we will therefore ignore the other dirac structures in the numerator . in order to regulate the ir divergences we keep @xmath64 . performing the @xmath52 integral for this structure by using the first pole in ( [ poles ] ) , we find @xmath65 ^ 2\\frac{k^2_\\perp",

    "this procedure can be generalized in several ways .",
