    "that there is still no consensus as to how dwarf galaxies form is demonstrated by the number of theories which exist to explain their origin .",
    "the dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies , in particular , present a challenge  and indeed a constraint  to our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "the properties of these galaxies , and the theories which are advanced to explain their origin and evolution , are summarised in detail by gallagher & wyse ( 1994 ) .",
    "notably , many of the hypothesised mechanisms imply that the dsph galaxies we see today could be surrounded by extended gaseous halos . in this paper",
    "we present the results for a search for such a halo around leo  i , using uv absorption lines to expose the existence of any low density gas around the galaxy which can not be detected in any other way .",
    "how might the formation and evolution of dwarf galaxies influence the distribution of gas around them ? dwarf galaxies may collapse and evolve almost independently from massive galaxies , forming in large numbers at early epochs from primordial density fluctuations ( ferguson 1994 ) .",
    "dwarf irregular galaxies may evolve from dwarf ellipticals by accreting gas cooling from the intergalactic medium ( silk , wyse & shields 1987 ) . alternatively , dwarf galaxies may act as the basic building blocks of all galaxies , merging at higher redshift to form the distribution of galaxies we see today .",
    "dwarfs seen at the present epoch would then be the few remnants from this earlier period of galaxy formation . with more massive galaxies in place",
    ", dwarf spheroidals may form as the result of interactions between galaxies ( gerola , carnevali & salpeter 1983 ; hunsberger , charlton & zaritsky 1996 ) , or they may evolve from more massive elliptical galaxies suffering substantial gas loss through sn - driven winds ( vader 1986 ) .    similarly , dsph galaxies may form and evolve as a result of mass loss from the cumulative effect of supernovae and stellar winds in more gas rich systems .",
    "such processes would be highly effective in re - distributing gas away from the center of the galaxy .",
    "supernovae may drive gas out of low mass ( proto- ) galaxies before most of the initial gas reservoir is converted into stars ( larson 1974 ; saito 1979 ; dekel & silk 1986 , ferrara & tolstoy 1996 ) .",
    "bursts of star formation lasting @xmath5 years would then deposit large amounts of energy into the surrounding interstellar medium , imparting enough momentum for the ( metal enriched ) gas to become unbound .",
    "the gas then escapes the galaxy and mixes with the intergalactic medium ( e.g. de young & gallagher 1990 ; de young & heckman 1994 ) .",
    "though these processes may be at work in all types of dwarf galaxies , extensive mass loss may weaken the potential well of the lowest mass galaxies , producing relatively round , low surface brightness and low metallicity remnants similar to the dwarf spheroidals seen in the local group ( saito 1979 ) , such as leo  i.    if the galaxy mass is high enough , it is possible that the flow breaking out of the main body of the galaxy will remain bound to it .",
    "this ` dwarf galactic fountain ' could then eventually fall back to the center of the galaxy causing subsequent bursts of star formation .",
    "recent analysis of color - magnitude diagrams of the stellar populations of carina and leo  i suggest that they have undergone more than one discrete burst of star formation ( smecker - hane  et  al .  1994 ; lee  et  al .",
    "1993 ) , which would support this theory .",
    "clearly , such evolution should produce multiple shells of gas spread over many kpc which ought to be detectable through uv absorption lines .",
    "thus , discriminating between different theories of dsph galaxy evolution has important implications for our general understanding of galaxy formation .",
    "importantly , most of these scenarios suggest that interstellar gas will be substantially disrupted , leading to its redistribution away from the stellar population .",
    "such gas is likely to be of low column density , however , and susceptible to ionization by the intergalactic uv background , making it difficult to observe .",
    "gas which is shocked due to its expulsion from a galaxy will also remain highly ionized . the only way to detect the gas is to search for the weak uv absorption lines it produces in the spectra of background sources . in this paper , we report on a search for c  iv , si  iv & si  ii absorption toward 3 qso / agns which lie 2.1 , 3.7 and 8.1 kpc from the center of leo  i. leo  i is particularly interesting because it contains a relatively young stellar population , with an age measured to be 1.5  gyr ( caputo , castellani , deglinnocenti 1996 ) , 3  gyr ( lee  et  al .",
    "1993 ) , and @xmath6  gyr ( demers  et  al .",
    "these first two estimates would place the stellar population s formation at redshifts of @xmath7 for any value of @xmath8 and @xmath9 in the usually accepted range @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( @xmath12 is the baryonic density parameter , and @xmath13  km  s@xmath14  mpc@xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the hubble constant ) . around leo",
    "i , therefore , there may still exist some evidence of an extended gas envelope which formed during the galaxy s evolution .",
    "in  2 of this paper we outline the observations made with _ hst _  and present the spectra obtained of the three probes , which show no absorption lines from leo  i. in  3 we list the equivalent width limits obtained and their conversion to column densities .",
    "we calculate a limit to the total gas column density in  4.1 , along with estimates of the gas volume density and mass within the inner radius of the halo , assuming two different models for the distribution of gas around the galaxy .",
    "finally , in  4.2 , we briefly explore the implications of our results for the hypotheses of galaxy formation and evolution discussed above .",
    "observations of q1004 + 1303 , q1008 + 1319 , and q0957 + 1317 were made 17-may-1995 , 03-june-1995 , and 29-may-1995 , respectively , with the large science aperture ( lsa ) of the ghrs and the g140l grating centered at 1416   .",

    "the data were taken with an fp - split of two , and quarter - stepped , giving a dispersion of 0.14    pix@xmath14 .",
    "time spent measuring the background was 11% of the total exposure time .",
    "the spectra were calibrated using the standard pipeline software .",
    "data sets taken at different carousel positions were coadded , wavelength calibrated , and resampled to a linear dispersion using the calibration wavelength files .",
    "the offsets in wavelength between the two fp - split data were then calculated with the stsdas iraf routine poffsets and a correction applied . for the q1008 + 1319 spectra ,",
    "the peak of the cross - correlation function was poorly determined because of the low signal - to - noise of the data ; however , for these , and for the two other data sets , careful comparison was made between the wavelengths of features in the fp - split data to ensure that the co - addition of the two halves of the data was correct .",
    "error arrays were constructed in the same manner using the pipeline error files .    to obtain an exact zero point for the wavelength calibration of the final coadded data , we compared the velocity of o  i@xmath22 and si  ii  @xmath23 absorption lines in the qso / agn spectra from the milky way , with the velocity of h  i emission along the line of sight to leo  i taken from the leiden / dwingeloo 21  cm h  i survey ( hartmann 1994 ) . for q1004 + 1303 and q0957 + 1317 , shifts of @xmath24 and @xmath25    ( 0.7 and 0.4 diodes ) were required , respectively . for q1008 + 1319 , the data were of too low a signal - to - noise to accurately measure the centres of the o  i@xmath22 and si  ii  @xmath26 absorption lines , but their positions are consistent with that expected from the 21  cm measurement , and no correction was applied .",

    "as figures  [ fig : spec1 ] and  [ fig : spec2 ] show , there is no evidence for si  iv or c  iv absorption from leo  i. 2@xmath27 equivalent width limits , @xmath28(@xmath29 ) , to the absorption are given in table  2a .",
    "@xmath27(@xmath29 ) is calculated from @xmath27(@xmath29)@xmath30 where @xmath31 is the error in the measurement of the flux at the @xmath32th pixel ( measured from the calibrated error arrays ) , @xmath1 is the number of pixels the line is measured over , and @xmath33 is the dispersion .",
    "the line spread function for the ghrs taken after the installation of costar is approximately gaussian with a width of 1.4 diodes fwhm , or for the data discussed herein , 5.6 pixels .",
    "we have therefore taken @xmath1 to be 11 .",
    "table  2b lists the equivalent widths , @xmath29 , of the milky way absorption lines .",
    "figure  [ fig : spec1 ] shows that the si  iv@xmath34 line seen in the spectrum of q1008 + 1319 is extremely strong and resolved , considerably stronger than the absorption seen towards the other two lines of sight . yet the corresponding si  iv@xmath35 line is absent .",
    "either the galactic si  iv@xmath34 has an equivalent width several @xmath36 from its correct value , or it is actually blended with a stronger higher - redshift absorption line ( possibly ly@xmath37  at @xmath38 ) and does not represent si  iv absorption from our own galaxy .    to calculate limits to the column densities of the gas , we assume that any gas which has not been detected would give rise to absorption lines with equivalents widths derived from the linear part of the curve of growth . for the limits listed in table  2a , lines are independent of the doppler parameter , @xmath39 , for @xmath40  km  s@xmath14 . for sightlines through our own galaxy toward extragalactic sources , or in high redshift qso absorption line systems , @xmath39 values of @xmath41  km  s@xmath14",
    "are measured for most c  iv and si  iv lines ( e.g. savage , sembach & lu 1995 , and refs therein ; fan & tytler 1994 ; lu  et  al .",
    "these lines are observed at @xmath41  km  s@xmath14  resolution , and may be comprised of several components .",
    "the few observations of c  iv and si  iv absorption lines taken at the highest resolution ( @xmath42  km  s@xmath14 , with the echelle of the ghrs ) , where individual components might be observed , are along sightlines through the milky way , for which values of @xmath39 between @xmath43  km  s@xmath14  for si  iv and @xmath44  km  s@xmath14  for c  iv are found ( savage , sembach & cardelli 1994 ; sembach , savage & jenkins 1994 ) .",
    "these lines may themselves be comprised of components which are not resolved even at this high resolution , but since single , isolated lines with small @xmath39 values are rarely seen , a limit of @xmath40  km  s@xmath14  is probably adequate to characterise any absorption close to our equivalent width limit .    table  2a lists the equivalent width limits to the si  iv and c  iv absorption lines .",
    "no useful limits can be obtained for the absorption toward q1008 + 1319 due to the low signal - to - noise of the data , but for the remaining two sightlines , we can derive column density limits for the following ions :    _ si  iv : _ toward q1004 + 1303 and q0957 + 1317 the limit to the column density of @xmath1(si",

    "si  ii : _ we can also derive a limit to the si  ii column density from the lack of the si  ii@xmath50 line , since the limit to the equivalent width is the same as that for the c  iv line : towards q1004 + 1303 , @xmath45(si  ii)@xmath51 , while for q0957 + 1317 , @xmath45(si  ii)@xmath52 .    _",
    "mg  ii : _ the ghrs spectrum taken by bowen , blades & pettini ( 1995 ; hereafter bbp ) allows us to place a tight constraint on the mg  ii column density toward q1004 + 1303 .",
    "bbp set an equivalent width of 40m , which corresponds to @xmath45(mg  ii)@xmath53 .",
    "the sightline toward q1004 + 1303 provides the lowest column density limits at the closest impact parameter , as well as an additional measurement of @xmath1(mg  ii ) from bbp .",
    "we therefore collate and summarise these limits in table 3 , although as can be seen from the results above , the limits to the column densities toward q0957 + 1317 are similar ( although no search for mg  ii absorption has been made along this sightline ) .",
    "to understand whether the lack of absorption in the halo of leo  i is significant , we need to estimate the limit to the total column density of gas along the qso / agn lines of sight . to convert to total column densities of carbon and silicon ( summed over all ionization stages )",
    "we need to know the ionization state of the gas .",
    "that is , we need to know whether c  iv or si  iv was not detected because the majority of the gas lies in a different ionization stage .    the absence of si  ii , and particularly mg  ii absorption towards q1004 + 1303 to good column density limits , suggests that any gas which is undetected is probably optically thin at the lyman limit , so that the h  i column density , @xmath1(h  i ) , is less than @xmath54  @xmath3 .",
    "for example , simple ionization models show that mg  ii disappears rapidly as h  i becomes optically thin at the lyman limit , ( e.g. bergeron & stasiska 1986 ; steidel & sargent 1992 ) , falling below @xmath55  @xmath3the limit we measure towards q1004 + 1303as @xmath1(h  i ) drops below @xmath56  @xmath3 .",
    "also , the lack of any detectable h  i around leo  i from 21  cm measurements ( knapp  et  al .  1978 ) to a limit of @xmath57",
    "also strongly suggests that there is no optically thick gas anywhere near the lines of sight .",
    "thus , to calculate limits to the total column densities of carbon and silicon , @xmath1(c ) and @xmath1(si ) , along the lines of sight , we assume that undetected gas is highly ionized , and that a significant fraction of it is in the form of c  iv or si  iv .",
    "this need not be so : models of the fractional ionization of different metals photoionized by a uv background by donahue & shull ( 1991 ) show that c  iv and si  iv rarely dominate the ionization fractions in the gas .",
    "however , they remain significant over several dex in the ionization parameter , @xmath58 , where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the ionizing photon and hydrogen densities respectively .",
    "further , if the gas was collisionally ionized alone , si  iv would cease to contribute more than 30% of the ionization fraction at temperatures of @xmath61 ( shull & van steenberg 1982 ) .",
    "if a significant fraction of the gas is _ not _ in the form of c  iv and si  iv , the implication is that gas around leo  i is extremely hot and highly ionized , and that @xmath1(h ) derived below is under - estimated .",
    "we also note that donahue & shull ( 1991 ) conclude that the resulting limit on @xmath62 for the narrow metal line systems observed at redshifts of @xmath63 is @xmath64 . at these redshifts the ionizing flux  and hence @xmath62is expected to be larger than the present day value .",
    "yet c  iv and si  iv only fail to contribute significantly to the ionization fraction of c and si for @xmath65 .",
    "hence if any ( undetected ) gas around leo  i was similar to that observed in higher redshift qso absorption line systems , the possibility of ionization stages higher than c  iv and si  iv contributing more significantly to the total amount of gas appears to be ruled out .    the total hydrogen column density , @xmath1(h ) ,",
    "is related to the metal line column densities by    @xmath66    where @xmath45(x ) is the column density of a particular element x , @xmath67 is the gas phase abundance of element x compared to its solar value , defined as @xmath68 , or , equivalently , @xmath69 , with @xmath70 the solar abundance of x. so if c  iv and si  iv contribute significantly to the ionization fractions of carbon and silicon , @xmath1(c)@xmath71(c  iv ) , and @xmath1(si)@xmath72(si  iv ) , we can calculate a limit to @xmath45(h ) .",
    "we take ( @xmath73 ) to be 8.65 and 7.57 for carbon and silicon , respectively ( morton , york , & jenkins 1988 ) .",
    "@xmath67 is not known for interstellar gas in or around leo  i ; gas around the galaxy is unlikely to be more metal rich than the stellar population , but again , the metallicity of the stars in not well determined .",
    "values of [ fe / h ] = @xmath741.6 , ( demers , irwin & gambu 1994 ) , @xmath742.0 ( lee  et  al.1993 ) and @xmath74(0.7@xmath740.3 ) ( reid & mould 1991 ) have been measured ; for our estimate of @xmath45(h ) , we adopt a value of 1/10 solar , @xmath75 .",
    "values of @xmath45(h ) for q1004 + 1303 are given in table 3 , and are @xmath76 derived from the limit to the si  iv absorption , and @xmath77 from c  iv .",
    "as noted in  3 , the values for q0957 + 1317 are similar .",
    "the table also includes the values which would be derived from mg and si assuming mg  ii and si  ii dominated their respective ionization stages , for comparison .",
    "( we take @xmath78 for magnesium )",
    ". these values would give @xmath1(h ) if our assumption that the gas was optically thin was incorrect , and lower ionization species dominated .",
    "we note that the absence of mg  ii absorption lines would give @xmath45(h ) @xmath79 .",
    "although we can obtain little information on the column densities toward q1008 + 1319 , 3.7  kpc from the center of leo  i , the two brighter objects allow us to quantify the column density of gas 2.1 and 8.1  kpc from the center .",
    "we conclude that for leo  i , the lack of low ionization absorption lines suggest @xmath45(h  i)@xmath80 , and that the total hydrogen column is @xmath45(h)@xmath81 , at separations of @xmath0  kpc from the center of the galaxy .",
    "this limit to @xmath1(h ) is too small if the gas is hotter and more highly ionized , or the gas phase abundance , @xmath67 , is @xmath82 .    to calculate a limit to the mean density of hydrogen around leo  i , @xmath18 , and the mass of hydrogen , @xmath83 , we consider two possible geometries for the distribution of any gas which may remain around the galaxy .",
    "we consider ( a ) that the gas resides in a spherical halo of radius @xmath84 , or ( b ) that the gas resides in a shell of thickness @xmath85 and outer radius @xmath84 .",
    "physically , the two models are important because they could plausibly arise from outflows of gas as a result of processes within the ism of the galaxy . fig .",
    "[ fig : spec3 ] shows the limits to @xmath18 and @xmath83 , for @xmath86(h)@xmath87 and a qso / agn - galaxy separation of @xmath88  kpc ( although the results are practically independent on this latter value ) as a function of the assumed outer radius of the gaseous halo , @xmath84 .",
    "values of @xmath18 and @xmath83 can be read off the figure from the lines marked @xmath18 and @xmath89 for any adopted value of @xmath84 .    in the case where the gas resides in a shell ,",
    "it is necessary to make an extra assumption about its thickness .",

    "[ fig : spec3 ] shows that the total mass of gas around leo  i is not well constrained by our observations since a shell or sphere of gas could exist over a wide range of radii ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "in fact , the total mass of leo  i is known from derivations of the global and central @xmath110 ratios by irwin & hatzidimitriou ( 1995 ) , who found @xmath111 , and therefore @xmath112 for @xmath113 . from fig .",
    "[ fig : spec3 ] , it can be seen that this much mass could only give rise to a column density of @xmath1(h)@xmath114  @xmath3  if @xmath115  kpc and @xmath116  @xmath96 ( there is no solution for a shell since its thickness , @xmath85 , is comparable to @xmath84 ) . with @xmath117 ( knapp  et  al .",

    "for example , at @xmath45(h)@xmath119 , a strong constraint on @xmath84 exists because @xmath18 is comparable to @xmath94 . since @xmath120 for a shell or sphere to exist , it is possible to show that @xmath84 must be less than 5  kpc and that the mass of gas would be @xmath121 and @xmath122 for a shell and halo , respectively .",
    "unfortunately , the metal absorption line column densities required to obtain these limits to @xmath1(h ) are very low . for example , @xmath45(c  iv ) would have to be @xmath123 for gas with 1/10 solar metallicity to reach @xmath45(h)@xmath119 , a column density unattainable with current instrumentation . a more suitable probe of low column density h",
    "i would be the ly@xmath37  line , since the transition is sensitive to h  i column densities several dex less than the metal absorption lines .",
    "unfortunately , at the velocity of leo  i , ly@xmath37  absorption would be lost in the strong absorption from the milky way .",
    "the idea that dwarf galaxies may be responsible for both metal - line and ly@xmath37qso absorption systems at high redshift has been widely discussed ( york  et  al.1986 ; tyson 1988 ; impey & bothun 1989 ; rauch  et  al .",
    "our models show that low luminosity dsph galaxies like leo  i are simply not massive enough to have halos which can be detected from metal absorption lines , even _ if _ all their mass resides in an ionized halo .",

    "it does suggest , however , that the population of dsphs , which can be so prevalent in environments like the virgo cluster ( sandage  et  al .  1985 ) , contribute little to the absorption cross - section of metal absorption lines such as c  iv , si  iv , mg  ii , etc .    despite the fact that we can not rule out the presence of diffuse , ionized shells or spheres around leo  i",
    ", we note that the lack of absorption could also be because gas has been removed via dynamical processes .",
    "the absence of high ionization lines is consistent with the conclusion that there are no inflows or outflows of dense gas intercepting the qso lines - of - sight , as might be expected , for example , from concentrated galactic fountains or dense inflows destined to re - ignite star formation .",
    "if the galaxy underwent a transient period of intense star formation in which most of the gas was ejected ( larson 1974 ; saito 1979 ; dekel & silk 1986 ) , the gas could have merged with the igm for it now to be undetectable . assuming that when blow - out occurred , the shell moved to an escape velocity of @xmath124 after a short initial transient , the merging time would be @xmath125 , where @xmath84 is the size of the shell when @xmath126 .",
    "for @xmath107  kpc and @xmath127  km  s@xmath14 , @xmath128  yr . this is less than or comparable to the age of the stellar population measured for leo  i ( see  1 ) so it is possible that gas has been removed this way .",
    "gas which has existed around leo  i may have been stripped via interactions with neighbouring galaxies .",
    "indeed , similar hypotheses have been suggested to account for the _ origin _ of dsph galaxies ( e.g. gerola , carnevali & salpeter 1983 ) .",
    "it is impossible to generalise about the ability of interstellar gas to survive such encounters , its physical state , or its distribution around the parent dsph . in more massive galaxies , however , interactions occur such that tidal debris remains optically thick at the lyman limit , with column densities high enough to be detected at 21  cm .",
    "indeed , such debris offer some of the best material in which to cause absorption lines in nearby galaxies ( bbp ; bowen et al .",
    "1994 ; carilli , van gorkom & stocke 1989 ) .",
    "if leo  i was formed from a more massive , gas rich galaxy , one might expect the remains of the stripped gas to still be detectable .",
    "the lack of absorption suggests that any stripping which has occurred could not have taken place recently .",
    "we have searched for absorption lines of c  iv , si  ii , and si  iv arising in gas around leo  i , towards 3 qsos who lines of sight pass within @xmath129  kpc of the galaxy .",

    "<S> we have obtained spectra of three qso / agns with the ghrs aboard the _ hubble space telescope _ to search for absorption from low column density gas in the halo of the dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxy leo  i. the probe sightlines pass 2.1 , 3.7 , and 8.1  kpc from the center of the galaxy , but no c  iv , si  ii , or si  iv absorption is found at the velocity of leo  i. the absence of low ionization species suggests that the column density of neutral hydrogen which exists within @xmath0  kpc of the galaxy is @xmath1(h  i ) @xmath2  @xmath3 ; assuming that the high ionization lines of si  iv and c  iv dominate the ionization fraction of silicon and carbon , the limit to the total hydrogen column is @xmath1(h ) @xmath4  @xmath3 .    </S>",
