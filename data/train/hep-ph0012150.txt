    "among the various supersymmetric extensions of the standard model ( sm ) of elementary particles , there is a set of models where the goldstino superpartners are fairly light , even lighter than the electroweak bosons .",
    "such models emerge in the framework of no - scale supergravity  @xcite as well as in gauge mediation ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) . these goldstino superpartners  the scalar @xmath3 and the pseudoscalar @xmath4",
    " will be referred to as _ sgoldstinos _ in what follows .",
    "their couplings to the sm fields are governed by ratios of some soft terms from the superpartner sector and the supersymmetry breaking parameter @xmath5 . in general ,",
    "sgoldstino coupling constants receive contributions from various terms in the lagrangian of the underlying theory , but there are always contributions proportional to soft mssm terms . in what follows we will consider only the latter contributions .",
    "if sgoldstinos are light enough , they may appear in the products of decays of mesons ( e.g. , in @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) .",
    "this issue was analyzed in ref .",
    "current experimental results on the measurements of meson rare - decay rates place strong bounds on light sgoldstino couplings .",
    "if the supersymmetry breaking soft terms are assumed to be of the order of the electroweak scale ( as motivated by the supersymmetric solution to the gauge hierarchy problem of the sm ) , then the bounds on sgoldstino flavor - conserving coupling constants provide limits on @xmath2 of the order of several hundred gev .",
    "flavor - violating sgoldstino interactions might play a more important role in meson physics .",
    "the corresponding coupling constants are proportional to the off - diagonal entries in the squark soft squared mass matrices .",
    "then , if the off - diagonal entries are of the order of the current limits coming from the absence of fcnc , the measurements of mesons decay rates can give bounds on sgoldstino flavor - violating couplings that are strong enough to probe a scale of supersymmetry breaking up to @xmath8  gev  @xcite .    whereas the sgoldstino interactions with quarks of the first and second generations and with a @xmath9 quark could be measured in the mesons",
    "decays , the most direct way of determining sgoldstino flavor - violating couplings to the top - quark would be through anomalous top decays ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "this approach can be relevant even for sgoldstino masses @xmath10  gev , for which the constraints on @xmath2 arising from the analysis of the meson rare decays become invalid .",
    "this is indeed the subject of the present letter .",
    "we study the anomalous top decays into a sgoldstino and an up - type quark @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "subsequently , depending on the superpartner spectrum and the value of the @xmath13 mass , sgoldstinos can decay into sm particles or gravitinos .",
    "thus , different final states could be exploited as a signature of a sgoldstino coupled to the top quark .",
    "the sgoldstino masses @xmath14 and @xmath15 that will be relevant for our study are larger than a few gev s and smaller than @xmath16 .    in order to set the lhc potential , we recall that @xmath17 top quarks are expected to be produced with @xmath18 fb@xmath19 of integrated luminosity at the lhc  @xcite",
    ". then , on a purely statistical basis , one will be able to probe top branching ratios ( br ) down to about @xmath20 . in the following",
    ", we will assume this br range to be the lhc _ statistical threshold _ for the observation of a particular top decay channel .",
    "of course , background problems and systematics will considerably weaken this potential .",
    "indeed , for some rare top decays that were analyzed through dedicated monte carlo s the corresponding reduction in the potential has been estimated to be of at least one order of magnitude  @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "we first compute the top decay br s for the channels @xmath21 . then , after reviewing the sgoldstino decay channels and the corresponding rates , we discuss the possible strategies for an experimental search for events with a top decaying into sgoldstinos at the lhc .",
    "in this section , we work out the width for top decays into sgoldstinos through fcnc processes .",
    "the relevant effective lagrangian reads  @xcite @xmath22    where @xmath23 are the off - diagonal entries into the up - squark soft squared mass matrix ( for convenience we consider these parameters to be real   and @xmath24 respectively ( see ref .",
    "it is enough for our purposes to consider orthogonal @xmath25 mass matrices .",
    "the extension to the general case is straightforward . ] ) .",
    "then , the relevant top decay widths are given by @xmath26    where we ignore the final quark masses and introduce the parameters @xmath27 , with @xmath28 being the average mass of up - squarks .",
    "these parameters can be constrained from the absence of fcnc  @xcite only for the sgoldstino couplings to the quarks of the first two generations . for example , the current upper bound on @xmath29 at @xmath30  gev is about @xmath31  @xcite , @xmath32 and @xmath33 we denote the gaugino masses , the first two for the electroweak groups , and the third for @xmath34 . ] .",
    "however , for the couplings to top - squarks there is no such a constraint yet , and the corresponding value of @xmath35 ( with @xmath36 ) may be as large as 1 .    in figure  [ rate ] we present the top br into a sgoldstino ( either scalar or pseudoscalar ) and a charm - quark ( or up - quark ) as a function of @xmath2 , for an average up - squark mass @xmath37  tev .",
    "the three curves refer to three different values of @xmath35 ( i.e. , @xmath38 . for the sgoldstino mass ,",
    "we assume @xmath39  gev , that is a value quite far from where phase - space effects become important .",
    "only one out of the four possible channels @xmath40 is assumed to be open in the computation of the top total width .",
    "the quartic dependence on @xmath41 of the width makes the br for the top decay into a sgoldstino quite sensitive to the supersymmetry breaking scale . in the most promising case of",
    "maximal mixing ( i.e. , @xmath42 ) , one gets br@xmath43 for @xmath2 up to 10 tev , that corresponds to more than @xmath44 interesting decays occurring at the lhc for a wide range of @xmath2 ( from now on we refer to each of all the possible channels @xmath45 by simply indicating @xmath46 , unless differently specified ) . on the other hand , decreasing the mixing @xmath35 by a factor 10 reduces br@xmath47 by a factor @xmath44 . for @xmath48 ,",
    "br@xmath47 is more than @xmath49 only up to @xmath50  tev , when @xmath37  tev .    in figures",
    "[ rate2 ] and [ rate3 ] , we show the phase - space reduction of br@xmath47 for heavier @xmath14 values .",
    "we assume , respectively , @xmath51  tev and @xmath52 in figure  [ rate2 ] , and @xmath53  tev and @xmath54 in figure  [ rate3 ] .",
    "the three curves in each figure correspond to different values ( i.e. , 0.5 , 1 , 1.5 tev ) for the average up - squark mass .",
    "one can see that going to values @xmath55  gev , a reduction of the br by more than a factor 10 , with respect to the massless case , makes the problem quite harder in general . on the other hand , at fixed relative mixing @xmath35",
    ", a heavier up - squark mass @xmath28 enhances br remarkably . in general , larger values of @xmath2 will be explorable for higher values of @xmath35 and @xmath28 , and smaller @xmath14 .",
    "in order to analyze the possible experimental signatures by which a top decaying into a sgoldstino would manifest at the lhc , one has to consider the subsequent decay of the sgoldstino inside the experimental apparatus .",
    "indeed , for the range of parameters that are relevant for this study , sgoldstinos are expected to decay inside the experimental apparatus , not far from the collision point  @xcite .",
    "then , assuming that the supersymmetric partners ( others than the gravitinos @xmath56 ) are too heavy to be relevant for the sgoldstino decays , the main decay channels are ( for @xmath57 ) : @xmath58 the corresponding widths have been computed in @xcite .",
    "for a sgoldstinos decaying into a pair of photons , one has @xmath59 where @xmath60 , and @xmath61 is the electroweak mixing angle .",
    "for the two - gluons decay , one similarly finds @xmath62    that , for @xmath63 , dominates over the photonic channel due to the color factor enhancement .    for the @xmath2 values we are interested in , gravitinos are very light , with masses in the range @xmath64  ev .",
    "then , the sgoldstino decay rates into two gravitinos are given by @xmath65    and become comparable with the rate into two photons for quite heavy sgoldstinos , such that @xmath66 .",
    "sgoldstinos can also decay into fermion pairs , with rates @xmath67    where @xmath68 is the soft trilinear coupling constant , and @xmath69 for quarks or @xmath70 for leptons .",
    "one can see that , far from the threshold , the fermionic br s are suppressed by a factor @xmath71 in general .",
    "hence , the decay @xmath72 can be relevant for large trilinear couplings and/or if the sgoldstino mass happens to be not too far from @xmath73 .    finally , sgoldstinos lighter than the top quark can decay into massive vector bosons states . for @xmath74 and @xmath75 ,",
    "the @xmath76 and @xmath77 channels open up , respectively .",
    "the corresponding rates read @xmath78    @xmath79    where @xmath80 , and the variable @xmath81 that enters @xmath82 is the higgsino mixing mass parameter .    in figure",
    "[ branchings ] , we present the br s for all the scalar sgoldstino decay modes for six different sets of the mssm parameters @xmath83 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 gev . the only channel that is affected by the parameter @xmath81 is @xmath86 , that , since @xmath87 , is anyhow suppressed in the chain @xmath88 by the small phase - space factor in the top decay br . for this reason , in the figure  [ branchings ] we do not analyze the br s dependence on @xmath81 , that was however chosen negative in order to enhance the corresponding br(@xmath86 ) .    for a typical @xmath89 hierarchy , that corresponds to the gauge unification conditions in the mssm , one finds that the @xmath3 decay into gluons @xmath90 always dominates over the other channels .",
    "then , the @xmath3 decay into photons @xmath91 has a br typically in the range @xmath92 .",
    "decays into @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 can be important for relatively large @xmath14 that , however , are disfavored by the phase - space factor in the top decay br ( cf",
    ". figures  [ rate2 ] and [ rate3 ] )  . and",
    "@xmath96 ( where @xmath97 and @xmath98 are off - shell bosons decaying into a _ real _ fermion pair ) could be significant in some interval below the corresponding theresholds for boson pairs , similarly to the higgs boson case .",
    "] on the other hand , the sgoldstino decay into @xmath9 quarks @xmath99 can have br values in an interesting range when the soft trilinear coupling @xmath68 is large enough , and for moderate @xmath14 . for the parameter sets of figures  [ branchings ] , c ) and",
    "d ) , br(@xmath100 ) reaches values even larger than @xmath101 , for @xmath102gev .",
    "particularly interesting in view of the possibility of detecting a signal in a hadron collider ( see also below ) is the case where one drops the typical @xmath89 hierarchy of the mssm , and allows @xmath83 and/or @xmath32 to be larger than @xmath33 .",
    "representative examples of this case are considered in figures  [ branchings ] , e ) and f ) , where one reaches comparable values of br(@xmath91 ) and br(@xmath90 ) , and even br(@xmath103br(@xmath90 ) . in the same framework ,",
    "also the decay @xmath104 is enhanced up to values of order @xmath101 , although part of the relevant @xmath14 range is penalized by the top decay phase - space .",
    "the main features of this discussion hold also for the pseudoscalar sgoldstino @xmath4 . the major difference with respect to",
    "the @xmath3 case lies in the @xmath105 width ( that is independent of @xmath81 ) .",
    "again , this channel is relevant only for @xmath15 values penalized by the top decay phase space .",
    "we now discuss the relevance of the different @xmath3 decay channels in view of the possible detection of a @xmath106 signal at the lhc .",
    "a complete analysis will require a thorough study via monte carlo s that can treat each particular signal versus the complicated backgrounds and systematics of a hadronic machine .    here",
    ", we will work out a few _ qualitative _ conclusions , based on the results of previous dedicated studies that set the threshold for the observation of top rare decays and higgs decays at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "these results sum up in the following assumptions for our analysis :    _ i ) _ we require the production of 10 events for a given signature ( or particular decay of @xmath3 following @xmath106 ) to be observable . on a purely statistical basis , this corresponds to a _",
    "total _ top br in that channel , given by the product br(@xmath107br(@xmath108 , in the range @xmath20 , for @xmath17 top quarks produced at the lhc .    _",
    "ii ) _ we assume that a generic _ electroweak - like signature _ ( like the ones involving photons , @xmath109 s , @xmath110 s and/or missing momentum ) can be detected at the lhc , and measured with an efficiency of the order of @xmath111 due to the background subtraction and systematics . the same efficiency is assumed for the detection of a resonant @xmath112 system .",
    "_ iii ) _ we assume that a completely hadronic ( non @xmath9-like ) signature of a top rare decay will not be manageable at the lhc because of the qcd backgrounds .",
    "this excludes from our study the @xmath113 channel .    in this framework , in order to be able to detect a sgoldstino decaying into the channel @xmath114 at the lhc , one needs @xmath115 and  @xmath116 \" giving rise to either an _ electroweak - like signature _ or a @xmath112 system .",
    "let s go through some details on the detection of the possibly relevant @xmath3 decay modes :    * @xmath117 + this sgoldstino decay mode gives rise to the total final state @xmath118-@xmath119 in top pair production at the lhc .",
    "one should tag one of the top in the usual @xmath120-@xmath121 way .",
    "then one has a hard hadronic jet plus a resonant two - photon system , with a total invariant mass of the @xmath122 system of about @xmath123 . a proper cut on the @xmath124 invariant mass can help in suppressing the background through similar strategies to the ones worked out for the @xmath125 detection at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "assuming the threshold rate of eq.([sg - th ] ) and a typical br(@xmath126 , one can explore through this very distinctive signature a value for br(@xmath106 ) down to @xmath127 .",
    "in particular , for a maximal squark mixing and @xmath37  tev , one can probe @xmath2 up to about 10 tev ( cf .",
    "figure  [ rate ] ) . for a squark mixing @xmath101",
    "one can cover up to @xmath128  tev .",
    "the dedicated assumptions of a broken @xmath89 hierarchy in figures  [ branchings ] , e ) and f ) , would translate into even more promising ranges , with br(@xmath106 ) explorable down to @xmath129 , and , correspondingly , into larger values of @xmath2 .",
    "* @xmath130 + in this case , the total final signature is @xmath131-@xmath132-@xmath133 with a resonant @xmath134-@xmath135 system .",

    "hence , this channel could have a comparable potential to the @xmath117 one , but for a restricted @xmath14 range .",
    "* @xmath136 + gravitinos give rise to missing transverse energy in the event .",
    "the total final signature is then @xmath120-@xmath137 . assuming that the threshold in eq.([sg - th ] ) is also effective in this case , this channel can be useful for intermediate values of @xmath14 in the range @xmath138  gev .",

    "is hardly viable , since it is relevant for a @xmath14 range ( @xmath152gev ) where the phase - space suppression of the top width is fully effective .",
    "note that one could also exploit the single - top production sample of top quarks , with a different final signature .",
    "this would enlarge the present statistics by about 15%-20% @xcite .",

    "we studied both the decay rates and the relevant experimental signatures .",
