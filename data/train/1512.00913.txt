    "the atmospheric neutrino oscillations have been experimentally confirmed by the super - kamiokande collaboration @xcite . a similar oscillation phenomenon , the solar neutrino oscillations , has been long suggested @xcite and have been finally confirmed by various collaborations @xcite .",
    "theoretically , the neutrino oscillations are realised if neutrinos have different masses and can be explained by mixings of three flavour neutrinos @xmath2 .",
    "these mixings are well described by a unitary matrix @xmath3 @xcite involving three mixing angles @xmath4 , which converts three neutrino mass eigenstates @xmath5 with masses @xmath6 into @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , leptonic cp violation is induced if @xmath3 contains phases which are given by one cp - violating dirac phase @xmath7 and two cp - violating majorana phases @xmath8 @xcite",
    ".    there have been various discussions of flavour neutrino mass matrix to ensure the appearance of the observed neutrino mixings and masses @xcite .",
    "the flavour neutrino mass matrix @xmath9 is parameterized by @xmath10 where @xmath11 .",
    "the elements of the mass matrix , @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) , are functions of the mixing angles , mass eigenstates and cp phases : @xmath14 our recent discussions @xcite have found that @xmath15 as well as @xmath16 are expressed in terms of @xmath17 as follows : @xmath18 and @xmath19 various specific textures of flavour neutrino mass matrices for the maximal cp violation and the maximal atmospheric neutrino mixing have been obtained by using the relation of eq.([eq : m_func ] ) @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we would like to remind you about the useful formulae for the flavour neutrino masses expressed in terms of @xmath20 . in sec.[sec :",
    "formulae ] , we show the useful formulae . in sec.[sec : texture_two_zeros ] , to demonstrate the usefulness of flavour neutrino masses expressed in terms of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , we use the formulae to find exact analytical expressions for flavour neutrino masses , mass eigenstates and cp - violating majorana phases in the texture two zeros . to confirm results of our discussions more concretely , we study the following three subjects based on numerical and semi - analytical calculations : ( 1 ) the consistency between our results and conclusions obtained from other papers , ( 2 ) the upper limit of the effective majorana neutrino mass for the neutrino less double beta decay for maximal dirac cp - violation and ( 3 ) the dependence of the cp - violating majorana phases on the cp - violating dirac phase .",
    "the final section sec.[sec : summary ] is devoted to summary .",
    "we summarise the useful formulae found in ref @xcite .",
    "we adopt the standard parameterization of the unitary matrix @xmath21 @xcite with @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( as well as @xmath27 ) and @xmath28 represents the @xmath29-@xmath30 mixing angle ( @xmath31=1,2,3 ) .",
    "the phases @xmath32 stand for the majorana phases .",
    "the physical majorana cp - violation is specified by two combinations made of @xmath33 such as @xmath34 in place of @xmath35 in @xmath36 @xcite : @xmath37 defining that    @xmath38    and @xmath39 we can derive that @xmath40 and @xmath41 eqs.([eq : mainrelations ] ) and ( [ eq : mainrelationsmass ] ) are the useful formulae which are announced by us in the introduction .",
    "there are alternative parameterizations of the unitary matrix @xmath3 .",
    "there are nine parametrizations of @xmath42 in the general case @xcite .",
    "because the reactor mixing angle is small ( @xmath43 ) , the following four patterns ( as well as the standard pattern @xmath44 in eq.([eq : u_0 ] ) ) are of great interest : @xmath45 @xmath46 @xmath47 and @xmath48 since experimental analyses of neutrino oscillations are based on @xmath49 , numerical values of the mixing angles other than @xmath49 need to be modified such as @xmath50 where @xmath51 are @xmath52 in @xmath44 , which are directly compared with experimental data .",
    "it is possible to express @xmath53 in terms of @xmath54 in these different @xmath3 s . as an example , in the case of @xmath55 , we find that @xmath56 where @xmath57 roughly speaking , except for the sign of @xmath7 , eq.([eq : mainrelations-2 ] ) is obtained from eq.([eq : mainrelations ] ) by the replacement of @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) , @xmath60 and @xmath61 . the replacement of @xmath61 can be understood as the effect of the interchanged rotations between @xmath62 and @xmath63 to get @xmath55 from @xmath44 .",
    "we have also numerically evaluated @xmath64 and @xmath7 and have observed that @xmath65 and @xmath7 indicate no significant deviation due to the smallness of @xmath66 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath67 requires larger values of @xmath68 to yield the same magnitude of @xmath69 owing to the suppression by @xmath70 .",
    "the neutrino masses turn out to be : @xmath71{m _ + } \\nonumber\\\\ & &   + { m_{ee } } , \\nonumber\\\\ { m_2}{e^ { - i{\\phi _ 2 } } } & = &   - { t_{12}}{m _ - } + \\frac{{{t_{23}}}}{{2{c_{12}}}}{m _ + } + { m_{ee } } , \\nonumber\\\\ { m_3}{e^ { - i{\\phi _ 3 } } } & = &   - { t_{12}}{e^ { - 2i{\\delta}}}{m _ - } \\nonumber\\\\ & &   + \\left [ \\begin{array}{l } \\frac{1}{2}\\left ( { \\frac{1}{2}{e^ { - 2i{\\delta } } } - 1 } \\right){t_{12}}{t_{23 } }   +   \\frac{1}{{{t_{13}}{c_{12}}}}{e^ { - i{\\delta } } } \\end{array } \\right]{m _ + } \\nonumber\\\\ & &   + { e^ { - 2i{\\delta}}{m_{ee}}}. \\label{eq : mainrelationsmassvariation}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] there is no simple relationship between eq.([eq : mainrelationsmass ] ) and eq.([eq : mainrelationsmassvariation ] ) realized by replacement of the masses and the mixing angles",
    ".    it will be interesting to discuss the phase structure of @xmath9 determined by these different @xmath3 s because there appear to be the different dependence of @xmath7 from the one derived by @xmath72 .",
    "since predictions of @xmath73 in various @xmath3 s are expected to be quite different from those by @xmath72 as have been learned from the comparison between eq.([eq : mainrelationsmass ] ) and eq.([eq : mainrelationsmassvariation ] ) , the majorana phases may give different behaviors from those predicted by @xmath72 .",
    "however , to discuss experimental allowed regions for cp - violating phases including @xmath7 as well as @xmath52 in @xmath74 is beyond the scope of the present discussions .",
    "moreover , there is another parameterization induced by three dirac cp - violating phases @xmath75 without explicitly referring to majorana phases @xcite : @xmath76 where @xmath77 .",
    "all three dirac cp - violating phases @xmath78 are physical .",
    "these dirac cp - violating phases are related to the phases in the pdg version as @xmath79 @xmath80 and @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "the advantages of choosing @xmath82 instead of @xmath83 have been discussed in refs.@xcite . for an example",
    ", this alternative parameterization provides that only the two majorana phases appear in the effective majorana neutrino mass for the neutrino less double beta decay . since constraints on @xmath7 and @xmath84 to be derived in sec.[sec : texture_two_zeros ]",
    "can be readily converted to those on @xmath85 s , we use the pdg parameterisation to compare our results with conclusions obtained from other papers .",
    "texture two zeros for the flavour neutrino mass matrix @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) have been extensively studied in literature ( see for examples @xcite ) .",
    "there are 15 possible combination of two vanishing independent elements in the flavour neutrino mass matrix .",
    "if we require a non - vanishing majorana effective mass for the neutrino less double beta decay and maximal or approximately maximal cp violation , the interesting textures are the following only four @xcite ( or less @xcite ) @xmath86 the texture zeros in the majorana neutrino mass matrix can be realized by imposing appropriate symmetries on the lagrangian of neutrino mass models such as an abelian flavour symmetry ( e.g. , the cyclic group @xmath87 ) @xcite as well as a non - abelian symmetry @xcite .",
    "the stability of texture zeros with respect to higher order corrections is protected by these symmetries @xcite .",
    "for example , @xmath88 and @xmath89 textures are obtained by imposing the discrete cyclic group @xmath90 @xcite in the framework of type - i @xcite plus type - ii @xcite seesaw mechanism .",
    "there are other symmetry realization of @xmath88 and @xmath89 textures .",

    "the @xmath94 and @xmath89 textures have been obtained by softly breaking the @xmath95 symmetry @xcite .",
    "the mass matrices based on the texture two zeros are good examples to demonstrate the usefulness of the formulae in eq.([eq : mainrelations ] ) and eq.([eq : mainrelationsmass ] ) . for @xmath91 texture , because of @xmath96 , it is evident that @xmath97 where @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
