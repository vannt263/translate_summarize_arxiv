    "the recent turmoil in financial markets triggered by defaults on subprime mortgages demonstrates that home prices are largely driven by buyers demands .",
    "indeed , in the early 2000s , house prices rose to record levels due to the high demand for mortgages with easy credit .",
    "the left - side graph in figure [ fig : rate_inv ] plots the case - shiller composite-20 house - price index , which shows that the prices peaked in 2006 , were stable for a while , and subsequently decreased .",
    "figure [ fig : rate_inv ] documents the level of mortgage rates and home inventories during the same period . during the house price appreciation cycle ( 2000 - 2005 )",
    ", there is a sharp decrease in mortgage rates and a slight increase in home inventories .",
    "low mortgage rates result in an increased demand for mortgages and housing .",
    "in contrast , the period with decreasing house prices ( 2006 - 2007 ) corresponds to a sharp increase in mortgage rates and home inventories . in this paper , we propose a mathematical model to explain the relation between house prices and buyers demands using a market microstructure perspective . we consider both market and personal shocks , and we analyze how these shocks affect the home owner s optimal sale decision and the resulting sale process .",
    "our model can also be used to forecast the future price evolution of house prices under different interest rate and demand scenarios .",
    "our paper is related to two topics in the literature : the optimal waiting time ( owt ) and the home sale price evolution .",
    "time - on - the - market ( tom ) , time - to - sale , optimal marketing time , and selling time are frequently used terms that have similar connotations to owt even though their exact economic definitions may differ .",
    "the existing literature in this area is mostly empirical focusing on the sign of the correlation between the length of tom and the resulting sale price .",
    "cubbin ( 1974 ) builds an econometric model to explain the relationship between the list price and selling time using data from the coventry housing market between 1968 and 1970 .",
    "cubbin finds that the higher the list price , the shorter the selling time .",
    "miller ( 1978 ) can not confirm cubbin s conclusion using 83 sales from columbus , ohio .",
    "miller s empirical study does not confirm the existence of an optimal selling time .",
    "kalra , chan and lai ( 1997 ) analyze 644 single - family house sales records in the fargo - moorhead metropolitan area to conclude that tom and sale price are positively related .",
    "genesove and mayer ( 1998 ) conclude from a study of the boston condominium market that owners with a high loan - to - value ratio have a longer time on the market and sell properties for higher prices .",
    "taylor ( 1999 ) studies the theoretical relationship between tom and property quality . knight ( 2002 )",
    "examines how changes in the list price impact the resulting tom and sale price .",
    "in contrast , our paper does not explicitly test the relationship between expected tom and our model s parameters , but rather we investigate the relationship between owt , list , and reservation prices .",
    "in addition , we also examine the relationships between owt and interest rates , and order arrival and withdrawal intensities - which are not well - studied in the literature .",

    "these models have been used to explain the behavior of buyers and sellers .",
    "buyers search until the marginal benefit of continued search is equal to marginal cost , and similarly , sellers equate the marginal benefit to the marginal cost of locating a bidder for their property .",
    "haurin ( 1988 ) applies search theory to investigate the relationship between the distribution of offers and the duration of marketing time .",
    "his empirical study concludes that as the variance of the offer distribution increases , the expected marketing time lengthens .",
    "sarr ( 1988 ) examines the optimal list price adjustment under demand uncertainty .",
    "wheaton ( 1990 ) investigates the role of vacancy rates in determining tom , the reservation , and sale prices .",
    "he finds that greater vacancy increases selling time , lowers the seller s reservation price , and ultimately leads to lower market prices .",
    "although we do not study vacancy rates in our model , our findings are similiar to wheaton s ( 1990 ) for a seller with a low reservation price . in this case ,",
    "owt increases and the seller expects less from the transaction .",
    "forgey , rutherford and springer incorporate liquidity into a search model . using data from @xmath1 single - family housing transactions , they conclude that an optimal marketing period exists and properties with higher liquidity sell at a higher price .",
    "yavas ( 1992 ) , krainer and leroy ( 2002 ) and williams ( 1995 ) also apply search and matching theory to analyze the sale prices of illiquid assets .",
    "our paper differs from these papers in our modeling approach .",
    "we do not use a search and matching model , but instead employ a market microstructure model .",
    "we incorporate the reservation price , the list price , the distribution of offers , withdrawal rates for buyers offers , and deterministic and stochastic interest rates .",
    "the seller s motivation is captured by a time impatient utility function .",
    "we find the optimal selling time that maximizes the seller s expected utility .",
    "owt in our model is set at the beginning of the sales process .",
    "optimal timing of investment has been previously studied in the case of known asset price dynamics by grenadier and wang ( 2005 ) and evans , henderson and hobson ( 2007 ) . in our paper , we do not study the risk associated with the waiting period - which is well - documented by lin and vandell ( 2007 ) .",
    "real estate market price evolutions are considered in the second part of our paper .",
    "the existing literature on price evolutions relies mostly on econometric models .",
    "since the housing market is heterogeneous in the qualities of the properties , most of the existing literature is devoted to developing statistical techniques to overcome this heterogeneity by forming price indices for geographical areas , see bailey , muth and nourse ( 1963 ) , case k. and shiller ( 1987 ) , case k. and shiller ( 1990 ) , case b. and quigley ( 1991 ) , and poterba , weill and shiller ( 1991 ) , goetzmann and peng ( 2006 ) , and mcmillen and thorsnes ( 2006 ) .",
    "another stream of literature uses equilibrium theory to estimate house price dynamics . stein ( 1995 )",
    "explains the large swings in prices by introducing an equilibrium model with a down - payment effect .",
    "similarly , ortalo - magne and rady ( 2006 ) present a recursive equilibrium model that accounts for income shocks and credit constraints .",
    "capozza , hendershott and mack ( 2004 ) use mean reversion and serial correlation to explain equilibrium house price dynamics .",
    "our model differs from this literature .",
    "we use the derived analytics from our owt framework and extend it to multiple selling periods to determine the price evolution . given the linkage between the seller and the buyer ( e.g. , the transaction price becomes the reservation price of the buyer when he posts the property for sale ) , we construct a property price evolution by tracking the expected sale price in the selling process .",
    "our owt framework enables us to examine housing price movements under different interest rate and demand scenarios .",
    "we model the timing of the decision of sale for each owner with random income and personal shocks .",
    "simulation shows that the fluctuation in housing prices are driven by interest rates , demand for the asset , and reservation prices .",
    "this paper is organized as follow .",
    "section 2 introduces the model within the owt framework .",
    "we start with an auxiliary model , extend it to more realistic cases , and analyze the comparative statistics of owt with respect to model parameters .",
    "section 3 applies our model to the price evolution in the real estate market .",
    "section 4 provides a simulation and reflects on the subprime lending crisis . finally , section 5 concludes .",
    "sellers of illiquid real assets often face a difficult decision regarding how long they should keep the asset on the market if they do not receive any offers matching the list price .",
    "if the asset is highly desirable , the seller might remain undecided even in the case of receiving an offer at the list price .",
    "he may wait an additional amount of time in hopes of receiving an offer even greater than the list price .",
    "if he chooses to wait longer , he may lose the current offer .",
    "as this discussion implies , the determination of the waiting time is complicated when there is a mutual decision process between the seller and the buyer .",
    "this section analyzes the optimal amount of time that a seller should wait in this mutual decision process to maximize his expected payoff .",
    "we consider two cases in our optimal waiting time ( owt ) analysis . in the first",
    ", the seller does not specify his final list price and accepts the highest available offer exceeding his reservation price , @xmath2 , at the end of the owt . in the second",
    ", he publicly announces the list price , @xmath3 , and keeps the reservation price @xmath2 private .",
    "he sells the asset if he receives an offer greater than @xmath3 ; otherwise , he waits until the end of the owt and then chooses the best offer greater than @xmath2 .",
    "we assume that buyers make offers at random times with random magnitudes .",
    "buyers may also withdraw their offers according to a known random process .",
    "we begin with the mathematical formulation of an auxiliary model .",
    "we provide the details of the derivation for this auxiliary model in the appendix .",
    "we then consider the two cases : ( i ) where the reservation and list prices are private information , and ( ii ) where the seller announces a pre - determined list price",
    ".      in the auxiliary model , the seller s reservation price , denoted @xmath4 , is public information ( i.e. , all of the offers that the seller receives are higher than @xmath4 ) .",
    "we assume that the arrival times of the buyers offers follow a one - dimensional poisson point process with parameter @xmath5 , and the magnitudes of their offers are uniformly distributed with @xmath6 where @xmath7 is finite . after making an offer , a buyer may withdraw his offer .",
    "the time to withdrawal is assumed to follow an exponential distribution with parameter @xmath8 .",
    "lastly , interest rates are assumed constant and equal to @xmath9 .",
    "the seller maximizes their discounted expected payoff with respect to the waiting time , @xmath10 .",
    "let the expected discounted payoff function be denoted by @xmath11 .",
    "the following lemma characterizes this quantity .",
    "@xmath12    where @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "see appendix a.    this lemma is used in the following two cases .      in this case",
    "the seller s reservation price , @xmath2 , is private information .",
    "the seller does not post a list price , and considers all offers until the end of the waiting time . here",
    "the seller has a minimum price for a sale , but does nt limit the upside payoff .    using the thinning principle for poisson processes , resnick ( 1992 ) , the expected discounted payoff , @xmath15 ,",
    "can be computed as in the following corollary .",
    "[ corolloary : case2 ] @xmath16 where @xmath17 .",
    "figure [ fig : case2 ] plots the expected discounted payoff as in corollary [ corolloary : case2 ] .",
    "the values of the parameters used in this figure are contained in the appendix .",
    "the expected discounted payoff equals zero at @xmath18 , increases to a maximum value , and then starts to decrease .",
    "this plot shows that there is an optimal waiting time .",
    "in this case the seller announces a list price , @xmath3 , and still has a private reservation price , @xmath2 .",
    "this case can be simplified by dividing the payoff function into two regions . from corollary",
    "[ corolloary : case2 ] , if the seller does not receive any offers higher than @xmath3 , the payoff becomes @xmath19 .",
    "the remaining region is when offers higher than @xmath3 are received .",
    "the payoff function , @xmath20 , is obtained by considering these two regions .",
    "[ theorem : case3 ] @xmath21where @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "if the seller does not receive any offer higher than @xmath3 , the payoff equals @xmath24 .",
    "given that there is an offer higher than @xmath3 , our payoff equals @xmath25 $ ] where @xmath26 is a random variable representing the arrival time of the first offer greater than @xmath3 .",

    "thus , @xmath28 = \\frac{\\lambda y}{\\lambda y+r}$ ] .  to find the resulting expected payoff",
    ", we only need the probability of receiving an offer greater than @xmath3 , which equals @xmath30 . as a result ,",
    "our expected payoff function is the sum of these two parts multiplied by their corresponding probabilities .",
    "figure [ fig : case3 ] graphs the expected discounted payoff with respect to the waiting time for a public list price .",
    "the values of the parameters used in this graph are contained in the appendix .",
    "note that the expected payoff function is strictly increasing in @xmath10 with an asymptote : @xmath31when @xmath10 increases , the payoff function is dominated by the region where the seller receives an offer greater than @xmath3 . unlike the first model , the asymptotic payoff is not a function of the waiting time , @xmath10 , and therefore , does not diminish with respect to @xmath10 . by setting a longer waiting time",
    ", the seller can almost surely get an offer greater than @xmath3 ( and because the discount factor , @xmath28 $ ] , does not depend on @xmath10 . )",
    "this is due to the properties of the exponential distribution for the first offer greater than @xmath3 .",
    "this figure does not imply that the seller waits an infinite amount of time to sell the asset .",
    "rather , it only implies that the seller makes a conservative estimate of the maximum waiting time before the sale process starts .",
    "the reason why the expected discounted payoff is increasing in @xmath10 is because there is no specific utility function associated with the seller s motivation to sell the asset ( see glower , haurin and hendershott ( 1998 ) who show that the seller s motivation is a significant factor in determining the selling time and the sale price ) .",
    "we can introduce this utility based sales motivation via a utility function , @xmath32 , defined as follows .",
    "@xmath33 where @xmath34 is the discounted payoff , @xmath10 is the waiting time , and @xmath35 is a time impatience parameter .",
    "as the time impatient parameter @xmath36 increases , the seller is more motivated to sell the asset",
    ". this _ selling motivation _ enables the model to incorporate different individuals , who have different sale processes even under the same market conditions . with this assumption , the expected utility function , @xmath37 ,",
    "can be written as follows .",

    "this graph illustrates this point with a decreasing concave - up function when interest rates are low .",

    "this figure also demonstrates that changing market conditions have a broad impact on the house sale process . in a low - interest rate and high - demand environment ,",

    "the reservation price of the house is close to its maximum and , with the high - interest and low - demand environment , the seller could not succeed in selling the house in two trials . eventually , the seller sells the asset in the third trial with a significant discount compared to his reservation price .",
    "our simulation provides some insights into the housing market crash observed during the subprime lending crisis ( for a review see crouhy , jarrow , turnbull @xcite ) .",
    "the record low borrowing rates during 1999 - 2004 increased housing affordability with the corresponding up - trend in home prices as shown in figure [ fig : rate_inv ] .",
    "when borrowing rates increased and home buyers mortgage contracts began to reset to these higher rates , low credit borrowers had a difficult time making their monthly payments .",
    "they either defaulted or were forced to put their homes up for sale .",
    "this coincides exactly with our modeling of a _",
    "personal crisis_. due to this shock , the home owner had to sell his house in an unfavorable market : high interest rates and low demand .",
    "as shown in our simulation results , the expected price in such a market environment is low .",
    "another catalyst for subprime defaults were the higher reservation prices locked in during the bull period .",
    "although demand should have been low during this period , borrowers still obtained financing - helped by the lower standards of the mortgage originators .",
    "to support this view , note that during 2002 - 2006 , the combined loan to value ( cltv ) ratio increased . in the subprime category , it rose to 88% from 81% and in alt - a category , it rose to 85% from 73% . when the subprime homes were put on the market",
    ", they could not get any offers matching their list price . as we discussed in our simulation , in a high - interest and low demand environment",
    ", it is very difficult to sell a property with a high reservation price .",
    "since most of the subprime borrowers paid for their homes at record high values , they had to lower their reservation prices during the sale process .",
    "this result is similar to our successive no - sale events when the reservation price of the owner is close to @xmath7 .",
    "this paper proposes a new model to describe the evolution of housing prices . we include exogenous shocks to the real estate market that may be the result of a profit opportunity or personal crisis .",
    "we investigate the sale process by introducing a new model for analyzing the time - on - the - market ( tom ) with a new construct , the optimal waiting time ( owt ) .",
    "we study the comparative statistics of the owt with respect to the model s parameters such as the arrival intensity , the offer withdrawal ( cancelation ) rates , and interest rates .",
    "we specifically look at the pairwise impact of these parameters and how they affect the resulting owt in the different regions of the surface .",
    "we incorporate our theory of the owt into a price evolution analysis that also includes an occupation period , a personal crisis or profit - taking opportunity , and the deterministic updating of model parameters with the occurrence of the sale .",
    "our model specifically considers the occurrence of sale , no sale conditions , and how the seller responds to the no sale scenario .",
    "our simulation results show that it becomes more difficult to sell a house in a high - interest , low - demand environment and that these conditions may require the seller to sell the asset below his initial reservation price .",
    "this results in a dynamic , time - dependent , and stochastic house price process which provides some insights into the recent subprime credit crisis .",
