    "an exclusion contour can cover from @xmath120 gev and @xmath382 up to @xmath383 gev and large @xmath384 .",

    "there is a similar variation in the exclusion contours . clearly , it is difficult to make a definitive statement about the reach of the tevatron in the @xmath380 final state with limited knowledge of the size of the bottom mass corrections , @xmath250 , which depend on the sparticle masses and mixings .",
    "it is important to realize that , for negative values of @xmath285 and large values of @xmath0 , the cross section increases due to a large increase in the bottom yukawa coupling @xmath23 , but this yukawa coupling may become too large to make a perturbative analysis possible .",
    "this would happen , for instance for values of @xmath389 and @xmath390 .",
    "one of the generic conclusions of this study is that , in the large @xmath0 regime , this process may be useful to test regions of parameter space which will remain otherwise uncovered . in general , however , the reach in the @xmath39@xmath0 plane is reduced to a relatively small region for values of @xmath39 of the order of the weak scale .",
    "the exact discovery and exclusion potentials depend strongly on the finite susy corrections to the bottom mass , which can be very large .",
    "we have also considered the possibility of detecting the higgs boson decays into @xmath64 .",
    "was largely overestimated in that work  @xcite . ] since @xmath264 is expected to be small , the @xmath392 channel is not very sensitive to susy  induced , large @xmath0 corrections .",

    "[ fig : bbbb ] shows that for @xmath393 120 gev , the reach of this channel is comparable to or even slightly better than the @xmath380 channel , and one may expect much room for improvement .    to study this process at the tevatron",
    ", we considered only the @xmath394 and @xmath395 decays of the @xmath396 pair , where @xmath397 or @xmath141 .",
    "this combination yields a triggerable lepton , a narrow jet , and two @xmath152quarks in the final state .",
    "it also has the largest branching ratio .",
    "the physics backgrounds are assumed to be @xmath398 and @xmath161 production . the signal @xmath399 and the background @xmath400 were simulated in a similar manner as before and increased by a factor of 2 to account for higher  order corrections .",
    "in addition , the @xmath22 polarization information was included for all @xmath22 decays through the tauola monte carlo program @xcite .",
    "the @xmath161 background was simulated using pythia 6.1 @xcite with the default settings , and forcing @xmath7 decays into @xmath401 or @xmath22 .",
    "for this analysis , the @xmath152parton is treated as a @xmath152jet , but the @xmath22jet is constructed from final state particles ( @xmath402 , @xmath285 , etc . ) .",
    "the @xmath53 is constructed from the real neutrinos from @xmath7 boson and @xmath22 decays .",
    "because the number of backgrounds is smaller than the previous case , and the signal and @xmath5 background have similar characteristics , it is assumed that the acceptance cuts can be looser .",
    "the basic cuts are :    * 2 @xmath152 partons with @xmath403 gev , @xmath404 .",
    "* 1 @xmath405 or @xmath141 with @xmath406 gev , @xmath407 .",

    "* @xmath410 , where @xmath411 sum over @xmath152 s , @xmath412 and @xmath22jet .",
    "after these cuts , the @xmath161 events produce the largest background . however , the jets and leptons from @xmath413quark decays are much harder and produce much more @xmath53 than the typical signal event .",

    "the signal is defined by a simple counting experiment , without reference to a mass window .",
    "several possible improvements could greatly increase the potential of the @xmath416 signal .",
    "first , with adequate @xmath53 resolution , a mass peak can be partially reconstructed .",
    "this could distinguish the signal from the background for @xmath417 .",
    "second , the second largest branching ratio for the decay of a @xmath22 pair is when both @xmath22 s decay to jets . while this channel would greatly enhance the signal , it requires a detailed background and triggering analysis beyond the scope of this work .",
    "as shown above , the couplings of the cp  even higgs bosons to bottom quarks depend strongly on @xmath250 . in the mssm framework ,",
    "positive or negative corrections are possible . however , in some specific models , the sign of the correction is correlated with the supersymmetric contribution to the amplitude of the decay process b(@xmath419 ) , which , at large values of @xmath0 , is proportional to @xmath420 @xcite .",
    "this is the case , for instance , in the minimal supergravity model , with unification of the three gaugino masses . for moderate and large values of @xmath0  @xcite , @xmath421 where @xmath422 and @xmath423 are the boundary conditions for @xmath201 and the gaugino masses , respectively , at the grand unified theory ( gut ) scale .",

    "cancellation of the positive contribution of the charged higgs boson @xmath429 to b@xmath430 requires @xmath431 , so that in these models the bottom mass corrections @xmath432 .",

    "[ fig : max_p_p005 ] and [ fig : max_p_p01 ] ) .    in general , in the absence of flavor violating couplings of the down squarks to gluinos , the @xmath45 constraint on the possible values of @xmath39 and the stop mass parameters becomes strong for large values of @xmath0 . for low values of the cp ",

    "stop contributions tends to be too small to cancel the large charged higgs boson enhancement , unless @xmath435 becomes large .",
    "this can not be achieved by pushing the value of the @xmath141 parameter to values larger than @xmath81 , since this would increase the chargino masses and lower the loop effect .",
    "hence , large values of @xmath0 and @xmath436 are preferred .",
    "the above mentioned constraints on the stop mass parameters for low values of @xmath39 can be avoided in the presence of a non  trivial down squark flavor mixing . in particular ,",
    "non  negligible mixing parameters between the second and third generation of down squarks can contribute to the @xmath428 decay rate via gluino ",
    "squark loop induced processes .",
    "for instance , if the gluino contributions were the only ones leading to the @xmath428 decay rate , the branching ratio would be given by  @xcite @xmath437 where @xmath438 is the value of the off  diagonal sbottom ",
    "sstrange left ",
    "right term in the down squark squared mass matrix ( which we assume to be equal to the right - left one ) , @xmath439 , @xmath440 and @xmath441 this expression ignores the potentially relevant contributions coming from a left  left down squark mixing  @xcite .",
    "observe that , for @xmath442 and @xmath443(1 tev ) , the contribution of the gluino mediated diagram to the @xmath428 branching ratio is of the order of @xmath444 .",
    "hence , even a small left ",
    "right mixing , @xmath445 , of order of @xmath446 can induce important corrections to the amplitude of this decay rate .",
    "it is straightforward to show that these low values of @xmath438 do not have an immediate impact on the higgs boson sector .    in the presence of non ",
    "trivial flavor mixing in the down squark sector , large corrections to the amplitude of the @xmath428 decay rate may be induced .",
    "these corrections may be helpful in determining values of @xmath45 consistent with experimental data for small values of @xmath39 and/or positive values of @xmath433 .",
    "for the above reasons , in our presentation , we have decided to keep the results for both signs of @xmath447 .",
    "the reader must keep in mind , however , that positive values of this parameter for low values of @xmath39 would imply a more complicated flavor structure that the one appearing in minimal gauge mediation or supergravity schemes .",
    "observe that the contributions of the charged higgs boson and top - squark loops to @xmath428 , should be computed including the effect of the bottom mass corrections @xmath250 in the definition of the bottom yukawa coupling @xmath23 .",
    "a next  to  leading  order susy qcd calculation of b(@xmath428 ) can be found in ref .",
    "we have presented a study of some of the mssm higgs boson signatures of relevance to the tevatron collider .",
    "we first analyzed the possibility of finding the lightest or heaviest cp  even higgs bosons in the @xmath1 channel . quite generally , for moderate and large @xmath67 , either the lightest or the heaviest cp  even higgs boson has sm  like couplings to the vector bosons .",
    "therefore , most of the @xmath448 plane is covered in this channel by producing the corresponding higgs boson with mass below 130 gev , provided there is sufficient integrated luminosity , of the order of 30 fb@xmath9 .",
    "however for @xmath449 gev and large @xmath67 , neither @xmath12 nor @xmath13 has sm  like couplings to the vector gauge bosons and the coverage is decreased .",
    "this problem is more pronounced for large values of the stop masses and mixing parameters . for smaller values of @xmath450",
    ", this problematic region extends to smaller values of @xmath39 . in these cases , very large luminosity , above 30 fb@xmath9 , will be needed or the contribution of other production processes will be necessary to assure full coverage . to cover the region of @xmath451 and @xmath217 ,",
    "we have combined the two cp  even higgs boson signals when their masses are close to each other .",
    "another possibility may be to explore the @xmath233 and @xmath234 channels , which will suffer from similar suppression factors in the production cross sections ( @xmath452 ) , but may be combined with the @xmath1 production process .",
    "furthermore , the branching ratio for the decay of the cp  even higgs bosons into bottom quarks can be very different from the standard model one .",
    "in particular , this takes place for moderate and large @xmath0 , when the off ",
    "diagonal elements of the higgs boson mass matrix can be strongly modified by radiative corrections induced mainly by top squark",
    "we derived an approximate expression in terms of the mssm parameters to clarify when this occurs , and provided examples when the decays into bottom quarks are suppressed in a large region of parameter space , thereby negatively affecting the tevatron reach .",
    "we have also emphasized that , due to supersymmetry breaking effects , the values of the bottom and @xmath22 yukawa couplings to the cp  even higgs bosons may be different from the ones computed including only standard qcd corrections .",
    "indeed , non  decoupling effects induced by supersymmetry breaking can become particularly important for large @xmath0 , leading to modifications in the higgs boson discovery and exclusion potentials at the tevatron .",
    "for instance , if the bottom mass corrections @xmath250 are of order one , the decay of the standard model  like higgs boson into @xmath64 may be enhanced , while decays to @xmath54 are suppressed .",
    "these supersymmetry breaking effects on the bottom and the @xmath22 yukawa couplings can also have an impact in the phenomenology of the charged higgs boson .",
    "in particular , they can be relevant for determining the tevatron limits on top decays into charged higgs bosons at large @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "the bottom yukawa coupling corrections are particularly important for the @xmath44 process , because the production cross section is proportional to the square of the bottom yukawa coupling .",
    "we performed a phenomenological study to investigate the relevance of these corrections .",
    "even with large luminosity factors , of the order of 30 fb@xmath9 , and negative bottom mass corrections , which enhance the production rate , the tevatron can discover a cp  odd higgs boson ( together with a cp  even higgs boson with mass and couplings similar to it ) only if its mass is not larger than about 200300 gev .",
    "the reach is only efficient for moderate or large values of @xmath0 .",
    "such values for the cp  odd higgs boson mass give positive contributions to @xmath45 , and the discovery of such a higgs boson would constrain the masses and mixing angles of the top squarks unless a non  trivial mixing between the second and third generation down squarks is present .    the computation of the higgs boson mass matrix elements considered in this article  @xcite",
    "is still affected by theoretical uncertainties , most notably , those associated with the two  loop , finite , threshold corrections to the effective quartic couplings of the higgs potential . recently , a partial , diagrammatic , two  loop computation of the higgs mass has been performed  @xcite . in the limit of large @xmath39 , these additional contributions lead to a slight modification of the dependence of the lightest cp  even higgs boson mass on the stop mixing parameters .",
    "for instance , although the upper bound on the lightest cp  even higgs boson mass for squark masses of approximately 1 tev is approximately the same as the one obtained to next  to  leading  order accuracy ( as done in this work ) , the upper bound on the higgs boson mass is reached for values of @xmath453 instead of @xmath142 , and has a weak dependence on the sign of @xmath454 . a diagrammatic computation of the two  loop corrections induced by the top yukawa coupling , which are included at the leading  logarithmic level in our computation , is , however , still lacking .",
    "@xcite    summarizing , at present , the @xmath1 channel with the @xmath7 decaying leptonically and the higgs boson decaying into @xmath152 quarks remains the golden mode to test the mssm higgs sector at the tevatron .",
    "the other channel we have analyzed , @xmath455 production with the subsequent decay of @xmath3 into @xmath152 quarks and @xmath22 leptons , proves to be very useful to cover regions of large @xmath67 and small to moderate @xmath39 up to about 250 gev .",
    "however , the reach in these channels requires a large total integrated luminosity . because of this , other production processes and higgs boson decay modes need to be carefully investigated if we want to fully probe the mssm higgs sector at the tevatron .",
    "we have identified regions of parameter space where the higgs decay into @xmath456 is strongly suppressed . in these regions , other search techniques",
    "will have to be considered , due to the presence of enhanced decays to @xmath457 , @xmath112 and @xmath114 final states . clearly , there is a motivation to study these final states , and in particular the @xmath457 one , even for lighter higgs bosons for which the sm higgs boson decay rate is strongly suppressed .",
    "in addition other production processes like the associated production of @xmath233 or @xmath234 with the subsequent decays into @xmath152 quarks and @xmath22 leptons may also be useful .    a careful study of all different possibilities , which may be relevant in different regions of parameter space , and the combination of channels may allow a full coverage of the mssm parameter space with luminosities achievable at the tevatron .",
    "if that is the case , the tevatron can discover a light higgs boson which might be beyond the presently expected lep2 reach for generic values of the supersymmetric mass parameters .",
    "most importantly , the detection of one or more higgs bosons at the tevatron will give very valuable information about the higgs and stop sectors of the mssm .    in the final stages of this work",
    ", two preprints appeared on related topics .",
    "one addressed the issue of the @xmath1 reach of the tevatron collider @xcite .",
    "the other commented on the possible effects of large @xmath0 corrections to @xmath44 production at hadron colliders @xcite . in the special cases",
    "when the analyses are comparable we tend to agree with their results , although the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite do not see any visible dependence on the sign of @xmath458 .",
