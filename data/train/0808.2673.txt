    "this paper describes constraints on possible new spin - coupled interactions using a torsion pendulum containing @xmath31 polarized electrons .",
    "several rather different considerations motivated this work . general relativity ( the classical theory that forms the standard model of gravity ) does not in itself make predictions about the gravitational properties of intrinsic spin  a quantum mechanical effect with no classical analog .",
    "because the classic equivalence - principle and inverse - square - law experiments all used unpolarized test bodies they can shed no light on this issue .",
    "in addition , these `` fifth force '' experiments were completely insensitive to the purely spin - dependent forces arising from the first - order exchange of unnatural parity ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 , etc ) bosons .",
    "lastly , the spin pendulum provided a means to search for a new class of preferred - frame effects that involve intrinsic spin .",
    "we established very tight bounds on long - range @xmath1-violating interactions and on velocity - dependent forces by searching for the effects of unnatural - parity bosons exchanged between the electrons in our pendulum and unpolarized matter in the earth and in the sun .",
    "similarly , we made sensitive searches for preferred - frame effects defined by the entire cosmos . in this case",
    ", we checked whether the spins in our pendulum preferred to orient themselves in a direction fixed in inertial space , or if they had a generalized helicity defined by their velocity with respect to the rest - frame of the cosmic microwave background .",
    "finally , we investigated non - commutative space - time geometries and obtained constraints that lie far beyond the reach of any proposed accelerator . in each case , our bounds are interesting because of their high sensitivity .",
    "a letter on the first results from this apparatus has already appeared@xcite .",
    "this paper , which supercedes ref .",
    "@xcite , reports additional data and more powerful constraints , provides a complete account of the experimental work , and presents a more extensive discussion of our constraints .",
    "it seems natural to us , when testing possible lorentz - violating preferred - frame scenarios , to let the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) define the fundamental inertial frame .",
    "we consider , in turn , three types of preferred - frame effects involving spin .",
    "first , we consider an interaction that violates rotational invariance and produces a laboratory potential @xmath34 where @xmath18 is a preferred direction with respect to the cosmos as a whole next , we consider a helicity - generating interaction that violates boost invariance as well , _",
    "i.e. _ a lab - frame interaction @xmath35 where @xmath8 is the velocity of the spin with respect to the cmb rest - frame .",
    "this velocity has two significant components  the velocity of the earth with respect to the sun ( @xmath36 ) and the velocity of the sun with respect to the cmb rest frame ( @xmath37 ) ; the small velocity due to the earth s rotation is neglected .",
    "finally , following the general ideas of kosteleck and coworkers@xcite , we consider a tensor helicity - generating term that produces a laboratory interaction @xmath38 we take cartesian equatorial coordinates for our inertial frame , where @xmath39 points north along the earth s spin axis , @xmath40 points from the earth to the sun at the 2000 vernal equinox , and @xmath41 .",
    "these possible spin - dependent cosmic preferred - frame effects differ from the known cmb preferred - frame effect in two important ways .",
    "first , if @xmath18 is a time - even polar vector , @xmath42 a time - even scalar and @xmath22 a time - even tensor ( untestable assumptions even in principle ) , then the interactions in eqs .",
    "[ eq : def a ] , and either [ eq : def b ] or [ eq : def c ] violate time - reversal and parity , respectively .",
    "second , if such spin - dependent preferred - frame effects exist , they could be observed within an opaque box that shielded out any normal information about the outside world .",
    "although we naively expect that any such preferred - frame effects to be suppressed by the planck scale and therefore of order @xmath43  ev , our results are sufficiently sensitive to probe such tiny effects .",
    "kosteleck and coworkers@xcite have developed a preferred - frame scenario in which spin-1 and spin-2 fields were spontaneously generated in the early universe and were subsequently inflated to enormous extents .",
    "these fields clearly violate lorentz symmetry but in a very gentle way .",
    "rotations and boosts of an observer remain lorentz invariant , but the same operations on a particle ( but not the universe ) obviously do not respect the invariance principle .",
    "the lorentz non - invariance invalidates the pauli - luders theorem , allowing kosteleck et al . to construct a field theory with @xmath44-violating effects ( the standard - model extension or sme ) that has been widely used to quantify the sensitivity of various @xmath44 and preferred - frame tests involving photons , leptons , mesons and baryons ( ref .",
    "@xcite has an extensive set of references to this work ) .",
    "our @xmath18 coefficient is identical to the sme coefficient @xmath45 which contains contributions from @xmath44-violating as well as @xmath1-violating terms@xcite .",
    "the sme has similar terms to our @xmath22 coefficients , but they are conventionally expressed in sun - fixed coordinates . to facilitate sme analyses and to compare our results with other work based on sme analyses",
    ", we also quote results in which the sun s velocity with respect to the cmb rest frame is ignored .",
    "arkani - hamed and colleagues have developed a consistent dynamical mechanism for the spontaneous breaking of lorentz symmetry that , in effect , proposes a pervasive , massless , aether - like fluid consisting of nambu - goldstone bosons associated with the broken time - diffeomorphism symmetry@xcite .",
    "the bosons form a `` ghost condensate '' because the assumption of translational invariance demands a negative kinetic term in the lagrangian .",
    "they form a condensate because higher - order terms are needed to stabilize the negative kinetic term .",
    "this fluid has remarkable properties . unlike a classical aether",
    ", it can be excited .",
    "it modifies newtonian gravity at long ranges and late times in the evolution of the universe .",
    "it behaves like a cosmological constant and is capable of accelerating the expansion of the universe , but maximally violates the equivalence principle .",
    "it defines a preferred frame that converges with the rest frame of the cmb as it reaches equilibrium , and as it evolves to its final state it mimics dark matter .",
    "cosmological tests of gravity limit the diffeomorphism symmetry - breaking scale @xmath46 to be less than 10 mev .",
    "interesting physics is possible within this constraint ; if @xmath46 were @xmath47  ev the condensate could drive the observed acceleration of the universe ; if @xmath46 were @xmath48  ev it would mimic the observed dark matter .",
    "particularly interesting in the present context , a fermion moving with respect to the ghost condensate experiences an interaction @xmath49 where @xmath50 is a mass scale associated with the coupling of the fermion to the condensate , and @xmath8 is the fermion s velocity with respect to the condensate , which we assume to be at rest in the frame where the cmb is essentially isotropic .",

    "[ fig : fft ] . except for signals at integer multiples of the turntable frequency caused by reproduceable irregularities in the turntable drive system ,",
    "the noise in the twist signal is close to the thermal value expected from internal losses in the tungsten suspension fiber .",
    "systematic errors associated with the turntable signals were eliminated by combining data taken with different orientations of the pendulum within the rotating apparatus .",
    "the heart of our apparatus is a spin pendulum , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spin pendulum ] , that contains a substantial number of polarized electrons while having a negligible external magnetic moment and high gravitational symmetry .",
    "the spin pendulum is constructed from 4 octagonal `` pucks '' .",
    "one half of each puck is alnico 5 ( a conventional , relatively `` soft '' ferromagnet in which the magnetic field is created almost entirely by electron spins ) and the other half is grade 22 sm@xmath28co@xmath29 ( a `` hard '' rare - earth magnet in which the orbital magnetic moment of the electrons in the sm@xmath80 ion nearly cancels their spin moment@xcite ) .",
    "the trapezoidal elements of the pucks were fabricated by electric - discharge machining and kept in precise alignment by aluminum frames .",
    "thin plates glued to the sides of the alnico pieces compensated for their lower density , @xmath81  g/@xmath82 versus 8.3  g/@xmath82 for sm@xmath28co@xmath83 .",
    "after each puck was assembled , we magnetized the alnico to the same degree as the sm@xmath28co@xmath83 by monitoring the external @xmath42 fields as appropriate current pulses were sent through coils temporarily wound around the pucks . by stacking 4 such pucks as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spin pendulum ] , we placed the effective center of the spin dipole in the middle of the pendulum , reduced systematic magnetic - flux leakage , averaged out the small density differences between alnico and sm@xmath28co@xmath83 , and canceled any composition dipole that would have made us sensitive to violation of the weak equivalence principle .",
    "the pucks were surrounded by a gold - coated mu - metal shield that supported 4 mirrors equally spaced around the azimuth .",
    "the 107 g pendulum was suspended at the end of a 75 cm long tungsten fiber which in turn hung from a mode spoiler that damped the pendulum s `` wobble '' , `` swing '' and `` bounce '' oscillations but had essentially no effect on the torsional mode . during the course of this experiment 4 different fibers were employed with diameters of either @xmath84 m or @xmath85 m .",
    "the upper attachment of the suspension fiber could be rotated to place any of the pendulum s 4 mirrors in the beam of the autocollimator system that monitored the pendulum s twist .",
    "we measured @xmath86 , the field inside the pucks , by arranging 11 of the trapezoidal sm@xmath28co@xmath83 elements in straight line , and used an induction coil to determine the field inside the sm@xmath28co@xmath83 .",
    "we found @xmath87 kg which was consistent with the suppliers@xcite specification of 9.85 kg .",
    "the absolute calibration of the twist to torque conversion was done by observing the pendulum s response to an abrupt change in the turntable rotation rate as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : caleot ] .",
    "the pendulum s free torsional oscillation frequency , @xmath88 mhz for this @xmath85 m diameter fiber , together with its calculated rotational inertia , determined the fiber s torsional constant @xmath89 dyne - cm / radian .",
    "polarized neutron elastic scattering studies@xcite on sm@xmath28co@xmath29 have shown that the room - temperature magnetic moment of the sm@xmath80 ion is extremely small , @xmath90 compared to the @xmath91 moment of the five cobalts ( see appendix [ ap : spin content ] ) .",
    "it is therefore an excellent approximation that the magnetization of sm@xmath28co@xmath83 is due entirely to the co. if we make the additional approximation ( which we relax below ) that the co and alnico magnetizations arise entirely from spins , then the net number of polarized spins in our pendulum is simply @xmath92 where @xmath86 is the magnetic field inside a puck , @xmath93 is the ratio of sm to co spin moments in room - temperature sm@xmath28co@xmath29 ( a negative quantity because the sm and co spins are directed oppositely ) , @xmath94 accounts for the puck s octagonal shapes and @xmath95 @xmath82 is the total volume of sm@xmath28co@xmath83 . as discussed in appendix",

    "this tilt is then removed by adjusting the lengths of 2 of the 3 feet upon which the apparatus rests .",
    "the lengths of the two feet are are controlled by varying their temperatures .",
    "figure  [ fig : feet design ] shows a cross section through one foot .",
    "the expanding and shrinking components of a foot consist of two lead rings ( 1 ) which are soldered to a copper disk ( 2 ) .",
    "thermal energy can be pumped into or out of the copper disk by a peltier element ( 3 ) thermally coupled to a brass block ( 4 ) that is held at constant temperature by circulating water from a temperature - stabilized reservoir .",
    "two g10 rings ( 5 ) thermally isolate the lead rings from the laboratory floor and from a stainless steel disk on top , upon which the apparatus rests .",
    "the peltier element and the brass block are clamped to the copper disk by one bolt ( 6 ) .",
    "specially formed g10 pieces provide thermal isolation between the bolt , the copper disk and the brass block .",
    "the thermal capacity and thermal resistance of the copper disk and the lead rings produce a 14-second delay in the expansion of the lead rings compared to the change in the heat flux provided by the peltier element .",
    "in addition , the thermal conductivity of the peltier element , which connects the copper disk to the temperature reservoir , affects the time constant of the response . taking these factors into account",
    ", we developed a model , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : thermal model ] , to predict a foot s response to a change in heat flux delivered by its peltier element .",
    "the model poses no problem for a real - time calculation because it can be solved analytically .",
    "the delayed response of the feet together with an 8-second integration time of the agi s leads to a low - pass behavior of the leveling system .",
    "therefore the response of the feet to fast changes of the tilt caused by imperfections of the ball bearings in the turntable is limited .",
    "the tilt caused by the imperfections of the bearing is periodic in the turntable angle .",
    "this allowed us to express the bearing tilt in fourier coefficients of the turntable angle .",
    "once these fourier coefficients are calculated , they are fed forward to compensate for the bearing imperfections . a simplified flow chart of the feedback loop is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : thermal model ] . with",
    "the feetback switched on , a typical tilt of a few @xmath398rad per day is reduced to less than @xmath399nrad .",
    "after the simple model described above was implemented , we found it necessary to add one further refinement .",
    "the dc offsets of the agi s drift slowly in time . a feedback system that holds constant the agi signals does not guarantee true level . with the feedback on , a drifting offset produces a 1@xmath239 agi signal with the opposite phase lag between the two sensors compared to a true tilt .",
    "our model extracts this fourier component and uses it to determine the agi readings that correspond to true level .",
