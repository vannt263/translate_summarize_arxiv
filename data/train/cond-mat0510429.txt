    "growing clusters are ubiquitous in nature and they exhibit fascinating structures and patterns .",
    "examples range from natural fractals , such as snowflakes and soots , to artificial structures such as networks , for example the internet and social networks .",
    "various growth models have been studied extensively by physicists over the last three decades  @xcite . in these models growth",
    "starts from a single seed site and proceeds via absorbing new particles into the cluster according to certain specified rules .",
    "different growth rules give rise to different growth models , examples being the eden model  @xcite , invasion percolation  @xcite , diffusion limited aggregation  @xcite and the growing network models  @xcite which have recently received much attention .",
    "there are two reasons why many of these growth models are often studied on a cayley tree ( or on the bethe lattice )  @xcite .",
    "first , the tree structure of the bethe lattice mimics a euclidean lattice in the limit of high dimensions where the mean field theory often becomes exact .",
    "secondly , the absence of loops on the cayley tree often allows one to obtain exact analytical solutions which are very difficult to obtain on a regular @xmath10-dimensional lattice .",
    "there is yet another compelling motivation for studying these growth models on a cayley tree and this comes from computer science . `",
    "storing and search ' of data is a very important area of computer science  @xcite .",
    "incoming data to a computer is usually stored on a cayley tree by using various data storage algorithms and the tree so grown is called a ` search tree '  @xcite .",
    "different algorithms lead to different search trees and in some cases , as explained below , the rules of growth of a search tree can be shown to be exactly equivalent to a ` physical ' growth model on the tree .",
    "thus the study of these physical growth models on a cayley tree provides important insights into data storage in computer science .    as a first example of this equivalence between a physical growth model and a search tree ,",
    "we show here that the eden model on a binary cayley tree is exactly equivalent to the random binary search tree ( rbst ) .",
    "consider the eden model on a binary cayley tree where the growth starts from the root  @xcite . at the first step ,",
    "a particle gets absorbed at the root , thus forming a cluster of size @xmath11 .",
    "this cluster has now two empty neighbors which defines the perimeter of the cluster . at the next step ,",
    "a new particle will get absorbed at any of these two perimeter sites chosen with equal probability , thus forming a cluster of size @xmath12 .",
    "the subsequent growth occurs following the same rule , namely a new particle gets absorbed at any of the perimeter sites chosen with equal probability . in fig .",
    "( 1 ) , we show a cluster after @xmath13 steps where the black sites denote the cluster and the shaded sites denote the current perimeter sites that are available for subsequent growth .     an eden cluster of size @xmath13 on a cayley tree .",

    "all possible eden clusters of size @xmath16 on a tree and their associated statistical weights w.,width=384 ]    on the other hand , a binary search tree in computer science is constructed by the following simple algorithm  @xcite .",
    "imagine that we have a data string consisting of @xmath17 items which are labeled by the @xmath17 integers : @xmath18",
    ". these could be the months of the year or the names of people etc .",
    "let us assume that this data appears in a particular order , say @xmath19 for @xmath20 integers .",
    "this data is first stored on a binary tree following the simple dynamical rule : the first item @xmath21 is stored at the root of the tree ( see fig .",
    "( [ fig : bst ] ) ) .",
    "the next item in the string is @xmath13 .",
    "we compare it with @xmath21 at the root and since @xmath22 , we store @xmath13 in the left daughter node of the root .",
    "had it been bigger than the root item @xmath21 , we would have stored it in the right daughter node .",
    "the next item in the string is @xmath14 .",
    "we again start from the root , see that @xmath23 , so we go to the left branch . there",
    "we encounter @xmath13 and we find @xmath24 , so we go the right daughter node of @xmath13 .",
    "this process is continued till all the @xmath20 items are assigned their nodes and we get a unique binary search tree ( bst ) ( see fig .",
    "( [ fig : bst ] ) ) for this particular data string @xmath19 .",
    "the binary search tree associated with the data string @xmath19 .",
    ", width=384 ]    usually the data arrives at a computer in random order . to study this situation ,",
    "one considers the simplest model called the ` random binary search tree ' ( rbst ) model where one assumes that the incoming data string can arrive in any of the @xmath25 possible orders or sequences , each with equal probability  @xcite .",
    "for each of these sequences , one has a binary tree .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "( 4 ) , we show the binary trees for @xmath26 along with their associated probabilities .",
    "all possible random binary search trees for a data of size @xmath26 and their associated statistical weights.,width=384 ]    comparing fig .",
    "( 2 ) and fig . ( 4 ) , one sees immediately that the eden trees after 3 steps have exactly the same configurations and statistical weights as the random binary search trees with data size @xmath26 .",
    "this analogy can be easily extended to all @xmath17 .",
    "the key point is that after @xmath27 steps there are @xmath27 occupied sites in the eden cluster and @xmath28 perimeter sites ( this is easy to understand as the addition of a new occupied site eliminates one old perimeter site while creating two new perimeter sites ) .",
    "the probability of subsequent growth at step @xmath28 at any of these perimeter sites is @xmath29 .",
    "thus the statistical weight of a cluster of @xmath17 sites formed by a specific history of growth is simply @xmath30 , which is the same as in the rbst model .",
    "thus the eden model on the cayley tree is exactly equivalent to the rbst .",
    "another popular search tree model is known as the ` digital search tree ' ( dst ) which is constructed by the following rule  @xcite .",
    "consider again a binary cayley tree each node of which can contain at most one entry .",
    "one starts with an empty tree and the data is stored sequentially .",
    "the first data item is stored in the root of the tree .",
    "the next one arrives at the root and finding it occupied , moves to any of the two empty daughter nodes chosen at random and occupies that node .",
    "then the next item arrives and again it starts at the node , chooses any of its two daughters randomly and moves there .",
    "if the chosen daughter is empty it occupies it .",
    "if the chosen daughter is already occupied , it again chooses one of its two descendants at random and moves there .",
    "thus at any stage , a new entry starts at the root and performs a random walk ( to the left or to the right daughter with equal probability ) down the tree till it finds an empty node and occupies the node .",
    "thus one obtains again a growing tree where at any stage growth can occur at any of the perimeter sites , but now the growth probability at a perimeter site @xmath31 is @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the distance of the perimeter site from the root .",
    "the dst is an important tree structure in computer science and has been studied extensively . in particular , it turns out the dst is a natural tree representation  @xcite of the data compression algorithm due to ziv and lempel  @xcite .",
    "recently it was shown that a diffusion limited aggregation model introduced by bradley and strenski  @xcite in physics is exactly equivalent the the dst model in computer science and a variety of exact results were obtained by exploiting this connection  @xcite .",
    "the examples above illustrate a profound link between growth models and the dynamics of search tree formation in computer science .",
    "note that the two search tree models discussed above , the rbst and the dst , can be considered as special cases of a general growth model where growth occurs ( i.e. a new particle gets absorbed ) at any of the available perimeter sites @xmath31 with a growth probability @xmath34 where @xmath1 is a constant positive parameter and @xmath33 is the distance of the perimeter site @xmath31 from the root of the tree .",
    "the rbst ( equivalently the eden model ) corresponds to @xmath3 so that all perimeter sites have equal probability to absorb a particle .",
    "the dst , on the other hand , corresponds to @xmath4 as discussed above .",
    "it is then useful and interesting to study this general growth model parametrized by @xmath1 and ask if there are any qualitative changes in the statistical properties of the growth clusters as one varies the parameter @xmath1 continuously . indeed ,",
    "aldous and shields studied a continuous - time version of this generalized growth model  @xcite .",
    "note that in the two models discussed above time is _ discrete _ and is equal to the number of particles in the tree .",
    "in the version of the model studied by aldous and shields , time is considered _ continuous _ and growth occurs at any of the available perimeter sites",
    "say the site @xmath31 with a _ rate _ proportional to @xmath35 where @xmath1 is a positive parameter .",
    "in this continuous - time model , the total number of particles in the tree at time @xmath36 is thus a random variable , unlike in the discrete time version .",
    "thus , while the discrete - time model has a constant particle number ensemble , the continuous - time model has a constant time ensemble , much like the canonical and the grand canonical ensemble in statistical physics .",
    "asymptotically at long times , both the discrete - time and the continuous - time versions of the model are expected behave in a similar fashion .",
    "henceforth , we will consider in this paper only the continuous - time version  la aldous - shields , since it is , from a technical point of view , easier to study than its discrete - time counterpart .",
    "the question naturally arises whether the statistical properties of the growing clusters in this model undergo any qualitative change of behavior as one tunes the parameter @xmath1 continuously .",
    "indeed , aldous and shields established rigorous probabilistic bounds to show that the nature of the fluctuations ( variance ) in the number of particles in the tree at time @xmath36 is qualitatively different for @xmath7 and @xmath6 . while for @xmath6 the central limit theorem holds and the total number of particles has a limiting gaussian distribution  @xcite , for @xmath7 the central limit theorem breaks down due to the appearance of anomalously large fluctuations",
    "thus , there is a sharp _ phase transition _ in the nature of the fluctuations at a critical value @xmath5 .",
    "however , the mechanism responsible for this phase transition and even the explicit quantitative behavior of the fluctuations above , below , or at the critical point were not easy to obtain within the rigorous probabilistic analysis of aldous and shields .",
    "the principal purpose of this paper is to provide a detailed quantitative understanding of this rather ` peculiar ' phase transition .",
    "our method , completely different from the original approach of aldous and shields , employs a backward fokker - planck formalism .",
    "the advantage of this method is that one can obtain exact asymptotic results explicitly .",
    "moreover , our analysis also shows that the mathematical mechanism behind this phase transition is similar to the phase transitions found recently in the variance of the number of nodes needed to store data on a @xmath8-ary search tree ( where @xmath8 is the number of branches ) at the critical value @xmath37  @xcite and also in the variance of the number of splitting events in a @xmath38-dimensional fragmentation model at the critical value @xmath39",
    "@xcite .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . in the next section ( ii ) , we define the model precisely and summarize the main results .",
    "we study here a generalized aldous - shields model where the growth takes place on a cayley tree with @xmath8 branches . in section iii",
    ", we derive the evolution equations for the mean and variance of the number of occupied sites as a function of time via a backward fokker planck technique .",
    "a simple scaling analysis is then carried out to determine the temporal growth exponents . in section",
    "iv a more thorough analysis of the evolution equations is provided that enables us to obtain explicitly not just the growth exponents , but also exact expressions for various amplitudes and prefactors that include interesting log - periodic oscillations .",
    "we conclude with a summary and a discussion of open questions in the last section .",
    "we consider a generalized aldous - shields model where growth occurs on a cayley tree ( rooted at @xmath40 ) with @xmath8 branches ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : mary ] ) .",
    "aldous and shields studied  @xcite only the binary case @xmath41 .",
    "initially the tree is empty and growth occurs in continuous time starting from the root @xmath40 . at any instant @xmath36 ,",
    "one first identifies the available perimeter nodes .",
    "a node @xmath31 at time @xmath36 is a perimeter node if it is empty at @xmath36 but its parent node is occupied at @xmath36 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : mary ] ) .",
    "subsequently , in a small time interval @xmath42 , a perimeter node @xmath31 either absorbs a particle with probability @xmath43 or remains unoccupied with probability @xmath44 , where @xmath33 is the depth of the perimeter node @xmath31 , i.e. its distance from the root @xmath40 .",
    "this growth process occurs simultaneously at all the perimeter nodes .",
    "thus , the total number of particles @xmath45 in the tree rooted at @xmath40 is clearly not a fixed number at a given time @xmath36 , instead it is a random variable in the sense that the value of @xmath45 differs from one history of evolution to another .",
    "we are interested in computing the statistics of @xmath45 at large times @xmath36 .     the growth of the aldous - shields model on a tree with @xmath8 branches and rooted at @xmath40 .",
    "the filled circles are occupied nodes and the shaded ones are the perimeter nodes where growth can occur subsequently .",
    "for example the site marked @xmath31 is a typical perimeter site at a distance @xmath46 from the root @xmath40 of the tree.,width=384 ]    in this model , we have two parameters @xmath8 and @xmath1 .",
    "it is useful to first summarize our main results .",
    "using a backward fokker - planck approach we derive an exact evolution equation for the generating function , @xmath47 where the angle brackets denote an average over all histories of the evolution process and @xmath48 is the probability distribution of @xmath28 at time @xmath36 .",
    "we show that @xmath49 evolves via the equation @xmath50 starting from the initial condition @xmath51 . by differentiating @xmath49 with respect to @xmath52 and putting @xmath53",
    ", one can also derive the evolution equations for all the moments of @xmath45 .",
    "the equation ( [ eqg ] ) is nonlinear and nonlocal in time for generic values of @xmath1 and @xmath8 , and is thus difficult to solve exactly , except for the @xmath3 case when it becomes local .",
    "however , we were able to compute exactly the asymptotic large time behaviors of the mean and the variance of @xmath45 for arbitrary @xmath8 and @xmath1 .",
    "below we present our results for the three different cases @xmath3 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 separately .    *",
    "the case @xmath3 : * in this case our model is precisely the continuous - time version of the eden model .",
    "this case @xmath3 is exactly solvable since the evolution equation ( [ eqg ] ) becomes local in time .",

    "( [ csol1 ] ) by taking the limit @xmath64 , is purely poissonian as expected .",
    "* the case @xmath54 : * since the growth rate at a perimeter node @xmath31 is proportional to @xmath35 where @xmath33 is the distance of the node from the root @xmath40 , it is clear that for @xmath54 , farther a perimeter node is from the root , the larger is its probability to get occupied .",
    "thus the cluster grows in a rather ramified manner where long branches grow faster than the short branches . in this case",
    "we expect that the mean number of sites grows at least exponentially .",
    "but since physically this case is of little interest , we do not discuss it further in this paper .    * the case @xmath55 : *",
    "we now come to the physically most relevant case @xmath55 .",
    "we show that in this case there is a sharp phase transition in the asymptotic statistics of @xmath45 across the critical line @xmath9 in the @xmath65 plane with @xmath59 and @xmath55 .",
    "we calculated exactly the asymptotic time dependence of the mean @xmath66 and the variance @xmath67 , for all values of @xmath59 and @xmath55 .",
    "we show that while the fluctuations are normal ( i.e. the variance of @xmath45 is proportional to its mean ) for @xmath68 , they are anomalously large for @xmath69 . even though we have two parameters @xmath1 and @xmath8 , it turns out that the asymptotic behaviors can be described in terms of the single growth parameter @xmath70 where @xmath71 since @xmath55 . in terms of @xmath72 ,",
    "the phase transition takes phase at the critical value @xmath73 .",
    "the normal phase for @xmath68 corresponds to @xmath74 and the anomalous phase for @xmath69 corresponds to @xmath75 .     the phase transition as a function of @xmath76 .",
    "the critical point at @xmath73 separates the phase ( @xmath77 ) with normal fluctuations from the phase ( @xmath78 ) with anomalously large fluctuations.,width=384 ]    more precisely , we find that for large @xmath36 , the mean @xmath79 grows as a power law ( up to corrections periodic in @xmath80 ) , @xmath81 and we provide an explicit expression for the amplitude @xmath82 .",
    "the variance , on the other hand , has different behaviors for @xmath69 and @xmath68 or equivalently for @xmath78 and @xmath77 .",
    "we show that the variance at large times @xmath36 , again up to log - periodic corrections , grows as @xmath83 we also provide exact expressions for the amplitudes @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 . in order to use these continuous - time results for the discrete - time model where the ` time ' is same as the number of particles , it is instructive to eliminate the explicit @xmath36 dependence in the results for the variance and instead express it as a function of the mean number of particles . eliminating @xmath36 between eqs .",
    "( [ eqm ] ) , ( [ eqv2 ] ) , ( [ eqvc ] ) and ( [ eqv1 ] ) , we get @xmath87 explicit expressions for the amplitudes @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 are likewise provided .",
    "we thus see that for @xmath91 the fluctuations of @xmath45 about its mean value , denoted by @xmath92 , are of order @xmath93 as is the case for a normal gaussian or poisson distribution .",
    "however for @xmath94 we find that @xmath95 for large @xmath96 . for @xmath94",
    ", we have that @xmath97 and hence the relative fluctuations about the mean become larger as we cross the threshold @xmath98 from below . the phase @xmath91 , or equivalently",
    "@xmath68 corresponds to a region of slower growth where the central limit theorem holds and the distribution of @xmath45 is asymptotically normal . on the other hand , @xmath94 marks a phase where rapid growth tends to occur along a single branch resulting in anomalously large fluctuations .",
    "thus the statistics of @xmath45 in this phase is dominated by extreme fluctuations .",
    "the nature of this phase transition is thus very similar to the ones recently reported in @xmath8-ary search trees  @xcite and a related fragmentation model  @xcite .",
    "we end this section with a remark on the usage of the term ` phase transition ' .",
    "the ` phase transition ' observed in this model refers to the abrupt change of the variance ( and also that of the full distribution ) of the number of particles @xmath45 in the tree as one changes the parameter @xmath99 through its critical value @xmath73 .",
    "this may not correspond to the traditional definition of ` phase transition ' used in equilibrium statistical mechanics , e.g. the divergence of a correlation length as one approaches a critical point as in second order phase transition .",
    "the ` phase transition ' in the aldous - shields model is closer to the change of behavior one observes in the diffusion of a lvy walker . a lvy walker jumps , at each step , by a random length @xmath2 drawn from a power law distribution , @xmath100 for large @xmath2 with @xmath101 ( required for normalization ) .",
    "it is well known@xcite that the root mean square displacement of the particle after @xmath28 steps @xmath102 for large @xmath28 only when @xmath103 , i.e. one gets normal diffusion and the asymptotic position of the walker is distributed normally . on the other hand , for @xmath104 one gets anomalously large diffusion , @xmath105 for large @xmath28 and the asymptotic distribution of the position of the walker is non - gaussian .",
    "thus there is a change of behavior at the critical value @xmath106 .",
    "the change of behavior in the variance of the number of particles in the aldous - shields model at the critical value @xmath73 is thus similar in nature to the the change of behavior seen for the lvy diffusion at @xmath106 , rather than the standard ` phase transition ' observed in critical phenomena .",
    "in this section we will derive the evolution equation for the probability distribution , and in particular the evolution equations for the mean and the variance , of the total number of occupied sites @xmath45 at time @xmath36 in a tree rooted at the site @xmath40 .",
    "the root @xmath40 , by definition , has level or depth @xmath107 .",
    "the method of derivation is based on a backward fokker planck formalism which involves considering the future evolution of @xmath45 conditioned on what happens in the first infinitesimal time interval @xmath108 . since",

    "<S> , a cluster grows in continuous time on a binary cayley tree , starting from the root , by absorbing new particles at the empty perimeter sites at a rate proportional to @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a positive parameter and @xmath2 is the distance of the perimeter site from the root . for @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> , this model corresponds to random binary search trees and for @xmath4 it corresponds to digital search trees in computer science . by introducing a backward fokker - planck approach </S>",
    "<S> , we calculate the mean and the variance of the number of particles at large times and show that the variance undergoes a ` phase transition ' at a critical value @xmath5 . while for @xmath6 the variance is proportional to the mean and the distribution is normal , for @xmath7 the variance is anomalously large and the distribution is non - gaussian due to the appearance of extreme fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> the model is generalized to one where growth occurs on a tree with @xmath8 branches and , in this more general case , we show that the critical point occurs at @xmath9 .    * keywords : * search trees , growth models , phase transitions </S>"
