    "the study and characterization of continuous phase transitions occurring on fractal substrates have attracted much attention during the past decades in the research fields of statistical physics and materials science .",
    "the very well - known general belief in universality states that for a given symmetry of the order parameter and range of interactions , the critical behavior only depends on the dimensionality d , i.e. the influence of the underlying structure becomes negligible at the critical point when the correlation length is much larger than the cell spacing .",
    "in particular , ising models embedded in different lattices in the absence of external magnetic fields , with short - range interactions and for a given d @xmath31 , exhibit a continuous phase transition characterized by identical critical exponents , with the critical temperature decreasing to zero at the lower critical dimension d=1 . instead of the replication of an elementary cell by translation , fractals are constructed by the iteration of a generating cell , consequently the topological details of the generating cell are present at any scale . in this way",
    ", the critical exponents also depend on other geometric and topological parameters , such as the ramification and lacunarity of the fractal@xcite .",
    "it has been shown that a second - order phase transition at nonzero temperature occurs only if the fractal substrate has an infinite ramification order@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the lacunarity , which was introduced by mandelbrot in order to give a measure of the deviation from the translational invariance @xcite , can be obtained considering the departure from the power law of the mass scaling definition of the fractal hausdorff dimension ( d@xmath4 ) , namely @xmath5 ( where @xmath6 is the mass inside a sphere of radius r centered inside a fractal structure ) .",
    "direct quantitative studies of the ising model on fractal substrates have shown that the values of the ratio of critical exponents @xmath7 depend upon the lacunarity and indicate that by increasing the lacunarity one has to introduce higher corrections in the finite - size scaling associated with the critical behavior of physical observables@xcite .",
    "most of the previous work on this topic was based on the same class of fractals , built in the same way as the standard sierpinski carpet ( sc(b , c ) ) , which have an infinite ramification order .",
    "a hypercube in d dimensions is segmented into b@xmath8 subhypercubes and c@xmath8 of them are then removed , this segmentation process is iterated on the remaining subhypercubes .",
    "the mathematical fractal is obtained after an infinite number of segmentation steps ( k ) . however , for practical purposes , a fractal is constructed by applying a finite number of segmentation steps .",
    "so , the physical observables show not only finite - size effects caused by the size of the system , but also a lower cutoff due to the segmentation step . as a matter of fact ,",
    "results obtained by performing monte carlo simulations depend on the number of segmentation steps , so it is interesting to know the way these observables converge to the ones expected for the mathematical fractal .",
    "the key point here is that in order to obtain critical exponents from simulations in equilibrium , one has to apply finite - size scaling analysis that is hindered by topological scaling corrections . these corrections and",
    "the critical slowing down increase when the fractal dimension decreases towards one .",
    "furthermore , due to these effects the segmentation steps studied could not be large enough to truly observe the asymptotic behavior .",
    "so , under these circumstances it is not surprising that also the critical exponents could not be easily obtained@xcite .",
    "furthermore , pruessner et al @xcite have questioned the validity of finite - size scaling on fractal substrates arguing that each segmentation step represents a new thermodynamic system that can not be treated as a scaled version of the previous one .    during the last years",
    ", nonequilibrium critical dynamics has been developed and a dynamic scaling form was found that is already valid in the short - time regime @xcite .",
    "in addition to the dynamic exponent z , the static exponents , originally defined in equilibrium , also appear in the short - time scaling form .",
    "this fact leads to new methods for the numerical measurement of all the static and dynamic critical exponents , as well as the critical temperature .",
    "since the measurements now are carried out within the short - time regime , they do not suffer from critical slowing down .",
    "because of the small nonequilibrium correlation length , it is also easy to overcome finite - size effects . due to the above - mentioned advantages the nonequilibrium critical dynamics within the short - time regime",
    "is a promissory tool for the study of continuous phase transitions on fractal substrates .",
    "hitherto , the topological effects on the short - time dynamic behavior and the possible corrections to scaling have not been systematically investigated .",
    "recently , we have reported soft oscillatory deviations from the power - law decay of the magnetization in the short - time regime@xcite for the ising model on the sc(3,1 ) with d@xmath4 = 1.8927 . on the other hand ,",
    "logarithmic periodic oscillatory deviations in the behavior of physical observables have been reported for several systems that present fractal characteristics embedded into the dynamics of the model and/or the substrate .",
    "some examples are the wave propagation in fractal systems @xcite , the blume - capel model on the sierpinski gasket@xcite , the dynamics of biological systems such as the bronchial tree@xcite , proteins @xcite , magnetic and resistive effects on a system of wires connected along the sierpinski gasket@xcite , and random walk through fractal environments@xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study the occurrence of topological effects on the scaling laws that describe the nonequilibrium short - time critical dynamics of a magnetic system on a fractal substrate . for this purpose",
    "we have performed extensive numerical monte carlo simulations of the ising model on the sc(4,2 ) .",
    "three different segmentation steps are investigated in order to show how the lower cutoff due to the finite - segmentation step affects both the critical exponents and critical temperature .",
    "this procedure also allows us to study the convergence of the measured values to the values expected for the mathematical fractal .    in section",
    "ii we introduce the model , we give the simulation details and remark on the main features of the short - time dynamic scaling . in section",
    "iii we present , analyze and discuss the short - time dynamic behavior of systems starting from both disordered ( iii a ) and ordered initial states ( iii b ) .",
    "critical exponents obtained under these two conditions are compared .",
    "also , in subsection iii c we discuss the topological characteristics of the substrate and their influence on the dynamic critical behavior of the physical observables .",
    "in section vi we present our conclusions .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows a sketch of the fractal substrate used in the present work , namely the sc(4,2 ) , for the segmentation step k = 3 .",
    "the hausdorff dimension of the mathematical fractal is given by @xmath91.7925 .",
    "in the case of the fractal , the convergence of relevant properties towards the thermodynamic limit occurs when the structure is constructed by the iterative process .",
    "such convergence is reflected in the dependence of the mean number of nearest neighbors per site on the segmentation step , which converges to a constant value as k goes to infinity . in order to study the critical behavior by means of monte carlo simulations it is necessary to simulate large enough segmentation steps to ensure that the asymptotic region is reached .",
    "for the sc(4,2 ) the deviation of the mean number of next - nearest neighbors from the value corresponding to the thermodynamic limit ( mathematical fractal ) , using periodic boundary conditions and determined by means of the transfer - matrix method , becomes negligible for k @xmath10 5 @xcite .",
    "as mentioned , the studied fractal has an infinite ramification order , which implies that the ising model would exhibit a continuous phase transition at finite temperature . in order to perform the simulation the spins were placed at the center of the occupied subsquares and",
    "consequently , the number of spins increases as a power law of the lattice size with an exponent given by @xmath0 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is then given by    @xmath11    where @xmath12 assumes the values @xmath13 , the sum runs over all interacting first - neighbor pairs and the positive exchange coupling constant @xmath14 corresponds to the ferromagnetic case .",
    "in this section we give a brief summary on the short - time dynamic ( std ) method for characterization of continuous phase transitions . according to std arguments@xcite",
    ", a magnetic system at high temperature and with a small magnetization @xmath151 suddenly quenched to the critical temperature t@xmath16 presents a universal dynamical evolution , which sets right after a microscopic time scale t@xmath17 large enough in the microscopic sense but still very small in the macroscopic sense .",
    "if during this time interval the nonequilibrium correlation length remains smaller than the system size the short - time dynamics is free of finite - size effects . according to the short - time dynamic scaling@xcite the magnetization , its second moment and the autocorrelation function should follow power - law scaling relations given by    @xmath18    @xmath19 } , \\label{ec3}\\ ] ]",
    "@xmath20    respectively . here",
    "@xmath21 denotes the average over samples , @xmath22 is the total number of spins in the sample , @xmath23 is the exponent of the initial increase in the magnetization , and d@xmath24 is the scaling dimension whose value may be different than d@xmath4 . also , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the standard - usually defined in equilibrium - order parameter and correlation length critical exponents , respectively .",
    "the scaling function behaves as @xmath27 for @xmath28 and @xmath29 for @xmath30 . extrapolating the results to @xmath31 the exponent @xmath1 of the initial increase in the magnetization , which is a new _ nontrivial _",
    "critical exponent , can be obtained .",
    "we remark that @xmath32 and @xmath33 have to be measured starting from fully uncorrelated configurations with strictly zero magnetization , i.e for @xmath34 .",
    "one should also expect that the generalized hyperscaling relationship given by @xmath35 would hold for the ising model on a fractal substrate ( see also equation ( [ ec3 ] ) ) .    for a dynamic relaxation from a completely ordered state ( @xmath36 ) corresponding to the ground state at @xmath37 , annealed to @xmath38 , the magnetization , the logarithmic derivative of the magnetization with respect to the reduced temperature @xmath39 , and the second - order binder cumulant should follow power laws in time , namely    @xmath40",
    "@xmath41    @xmath42 ^2}-1\\propto t^{\\frac{d_{eff}}z } , \\label{ec7}\\ ] ]    respectively . for @xmath43 , but within the critical region , the power - law behavior is modified by a scaling function , which for the magnetization is given by @xmath44 .",
    "so , this fact can be used to determine the critical temperature from the localization of the optimal power - law behavior .",
    "we have found that the dynamic evolution of the magnetization when the system is annealed from @xmath37 to a higher temperature @xmath45 close to the critical point is more sensitive to this final temperature than when the system is quenched from t=@xmath46 .",
    "furthermore , due to the large initial value of @xmath47 and its slow decrease upon annealing , the statistical fluctuations are less prominent , and therefore it would be expected that the topological effects may be easier to detect .      in order to study the effects of the topology of the fractal on the std and the convergent behavior of the critical exponents with the segmentation step , we carried out monte carlo simulations for segmentation steps @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( system size l = 256 , 1024 , and 4096 , respectively ) using periodic boundary conditions .",
    "simulations started either from the complete ordered state or from a disordered state with zero or a small magnetization .",
    "in the last case the initial magnetization m@xmath50 was settled by flipping , in a random disordered configuration , a definite number of spins placed at randomly chosen sites in order to get the desired value of @xmath51 .",
    "the time evolution of the system was updated by means of a metropolis algorithm using the marsaglia - zanan pseudorandom number generator@xcite .",
    "the time unit , defined as a monte carlo step ( mcs ) , involves attempts to update @xmath52 randomly selected spins .",
    "the time evolution was followed , depending on the initial state , from 10@xmath53 up to @xmath54 @xmath55 mcs .",
    "the magnetization , the autocorrelation , and the second moment of the magnetization were averaged over a number @xmath56 of samples with the same initial conditions but using different configurations .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the decay of the magnetization as a function of time obtained at different annealing temperatures for the segmentation step k=5 .",
    "as can be observed , log - periodic oscillations are present in the time evolution of the magnetization over the full range of time and for all temperatures .",
    "we believe that the log - periodic structure exhibited by the data is a typical feature of systems with discrete scale invariance ( dsi)@xcite .",
    "so , in section iii c we first show that the topology of the substrate ( the sierpinki carpet in our case ) possesses this property and subsequently , we formulate arguments linking the spatial characteristic length of the fractal to the time characteristic period of the dynamic behavior of the ising system .",
    "now , in order to account for our numerical observations we assume that the power - law behavior expected for the time evolution of the magnetization ( equation [ ec5 ] ) should be replaced by    1.0 true cm    @xmath57    where log(@xmath58 ) is a logarithmic period , while @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the amplitude and the phase of the oscillation , respectively .",
    "an similar expression to equation([ec8 ] ) has been used by other authors to describe the time dependence of systems that exhibit a dsi in their dynamic behavior , such as the energy release on the approach of impending rupture , earthquakes@xcite , and biological systems ( proteins)@xcite . in order to study the critical regime we settle down the temperature range that exhibits the smallest deviations from a power - law behavior , namely 1.09 @xmath61 1.13 .",
    "subsequently , we determine the critical temperature by finding the smallest deviation of the data from equation ( [ ec8 ] ) . for @xmath62 ,",
    "this study yields @xmath63 , where the error bar was assessed by considering the closest pair of temperatures that present noticeable but small deviations .",
    "the inset of figure [ fig2 ] shows the oscillatory component of @xmath64 that is nicely fitted by the cosine function for @xmath65 , and also shows the departures from the cosine function for @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "logarithmic periodic oscillations are also observed for the segmentation steps @xmath68 and @xmath49 , and the procedure previously described was also used to determine the corresponding critical temperatures , as reported in table [ tab1 ] ( 2nd column ) .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the magnetization decay at the critical temperature for the segmentation steps 4 , 5 , and 6 .",
    "the fits were carried out after disregarding an initial time interval @xmath69 = 30mcs , and the obtained parameters are reported in table [ tab1 ] . for @xmath68 , in order to assure that the nonequilibrium correlation length remains smaller than the system size , the considered time interval was 30 - 10@xmath70mcs . as observed in the inset of figure [ fig3 ] the logarithmic periodic oscillations of the magnetization decay have similar shape for k=5 and 6 , but they are slightly different for k= 4 .",
    "the critical temperature @xmath71= 1.10(1 ) is in relatively good agreement with determinations performed by means of monte carlo simulations in equilibrium and obtained by applying finite - size scaling , namely @xmath721.178@xcite and @xmath38 = 1.077(3)@xcite .",
    "furthermore , a careful inspection of the data reveals a systematic but convergent decrease in both @xmath73 and @xmath74 ( table [ tab1 ] , 3rd .",
    "column ) when the segmentation step is increased , suggesting that our results could be taken as upper bounds .",
    "the exponent @xmath74 for k = 6 is notably smaller than both the accepted value for the ising model in @xmath2 , given by @xmath75 @xcite , and our estimation for the sc(3,1 ) , given by @xmath76 @xcite . in this way at the critical point a larger deviation from the translational symmetry , i. e. an increase in the lacunarity , makes the decay of the long - range order slow down .",
    ".critical temperatures and parameters obtained by fitting the time dependence of the magnetization according to equation([ec8 ] ) : ratio of critical exponents @xmath74 , and logarithmic period ( log(p ) ) , amplitude ( a ) and phase ( @xmath77 ) of the oscillation .",
    "data obtained by starting the simulations from an ordered initial state and for segmentation steps k= 4 , 5 , and 6 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      discrete scale invariance ( dsi ) has extensively been discussed by sornette@xcite .",
    "it is a weak kind of scale invariance according to which an observable @xmath78 , which is a function of a control parameter @xmath79 , obeys the scaling law @xmath80 under the change @xmath81 . here",
    "@xmath82 is no longer an arbitrary real number as in the case of _ continuous _ scale invariance but it can only take specific discrete values , which in general have the form : @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the fundamental scaling ratio .",
    "it is easy to show that if an observable @xmath78 satisfies equation ( [ ecdsi ] ) for an arbitrary @xmath82 it necessary has to obey a power law of the type @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is an exponent .",
    "but in the case of dsi the solution of equation ( [ ecdsi ] ) in general has the form    @xmath87    where @xmath88 is a periodic function of period one .    to illustrate that the sc(4,2 ) leads up to dsi ,",
    "let us calculate the dependence of the mass for this fractal on the distance @xmath89 to an arbitrary position @xmath90 given by @xmath91 where @xmath92 runs over all the sites in the fractal and @xmath93 is the position of the i - th site .",
    "note that , in principle , the mass depends on the point @xmath90 we are choosing as coordinate origin .",
    "figure [ fig9 ] shows a log - log plot of the dependence of @xmath94 on @xmath89 , where @xmath95 is taken as one of the corners of the fractal .",
    "as can be seen in the inset , the mass oscillating component adjusts quite well to the behavior expected from equation ( [ ecdsi2 ] ) .",
    "the value for @xmath96 obtained by the fit with four terms in the fourier expansion coincides with the linear size of the generating cell , which of course is the fundamental scaling ratio . by choosing different positions @xmath90 , the dependence of the mass on @xmath89 looks different than the one shown in figure [ fig9 ] .",
    "however , when we compute @xmath6 , the averaged mass function over all the sites @xmath90 in the lattice , we have find that it is still possible to factorize a periodic part @xmath97 with @xmath98 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the mass , an exclusively topological property of the fractal , presents a logarithmic oscillating behavior , this a being signature of the dsi of the fractal .    1.0 true cm    we would like to remark that the fitted value of the fundamental scaling ratio @xmath96 for @xmath62 obtained from figure ( [ fig9 ] ) is in excellent agreement with the exact value given by @xmath99 .",
    "this result suggests a fast convergency of the logarithmic periodic behavior towards the value corresponding to the mathematical fractal and gives us strong confidence in the values of the characteristic time evaluated by fitting the logarithmic periodic dynamics for @xmath100 ( see table ( [ tab1 ] ) ) .",
    "the observed logarithmic periodic oscillation in the decay of the magnetization ( figures ( [ fig2 ] ) and ( [ fig3 ] ) ) leads us to abandon the standard power - law decay of the form @xmath101 ( equation ( [ ec5 ] ) ) and propose a new ansatz based on equation ( [ ecdsi2 ] ) , namely the typical power law modulated by a logarithmic periodic function ( see equation ( [ ec8 ] ) ) . of course , by means of this assumption we implicitly recognize that the dsi intrinsic of the susbtrate is somewhat capable of influencing the dynamic behavior of the overlaying ferromagnet yielding to a dsi in the time scale .",
    "following this line of reasoning one has to admit that the fundamental scaling ratio between lengh scales ( @xmath84 ) of the fractal has to translate into an intrinsic ratio between time scales for the oscillations given by the period @xmath58 .",
    "it is well known that for a critical system evolving towards equilibrium , characteristic spatial and temporal scales are linked through the dynamic exponent @xmath102 , i.e the development of the correlations up to a length @xmath103 scales as @xmath104 . therefore , going one step further in our speculation , we propose that the scaling ratios are also linked according to    @xmath105    in appendix a we demostrate under which assumptions this relation holds , but let us now show that equation ( [ ec12 ] ) is consistent with our measurements .",
    "in fact , equation ( [ ec12 ] ) implies @xmath106 .",
    "then , from table [ tab1 ] we take @xmath107 yielding @xmath108 . also , the logarithmic derivative of the magnetization yields @xmath109 , so one has @xmath110 .",
    "these rough estimations of the dynamic exponent can be compared to the accepted value for the 2d - ising model , namely z=2.165 @xcite and our previous estimation of @xmath111@xcite for the sc(3,1 ) .",
    "so , all these results are consistent with an increasing trend of @xmath102 when the fractal dimension of the substrate decreases , anticipating the occurrence of a dramatic increase in the slowing down , characteristic of the second - order phase transitions , in low dimensionality .",
    "furthermore , independent measurements ( see tables [ tab2 ] and [ tab3 ] ) yield to @xmath112 , so one has @xmath113",
    "( @xmath114 ) and @xmath115 ( @xmath110 ) , i.e. two figures in reasonable agreement with the fractal dimension of the sc(4,2 ) given by @xmath116 . on the other hand , based on both the measured exponent @xmath117 and the crude estimation of @xmath118",
    ", we could give a very rough estimation of the correlation length exponent , which should be of the order of @xmath119 , also in agreement with the trend shown for the 2d - ising model ( @xmath120 ) and sc(3,1 ) ( @xmath121 ) .",
    "we have studied the nonequilibrium critical dynamics in the short - time regime of the ising ferromagnet embedded in a fractal substrate , namely the sc(4,2 ) .",
    "the influence of the topology of the fractal on the dynamic evolution of some physical observables is clearly identified through at least two effects : i ) the dependence of the short - time regime on the segmentation step ; and ii ) the occurrence of logarithmic periodic oscillations superimposed to the power - law behavior observed in both the decay of the magnetization and its logarithmic derivative with respect to the reduced temperature , when the system is annealed from @xmath37 to @xmath38 .",
    "we propose that these oscillations are a consequence of the dsi of the fractal substrate .    in order to describe the decay of the magnetization upon annealing to @xmath38 we proposed an ansatz that involves the standard power - law behavior but now modulated by a logarithmic periodic oscillatory function ( see equation ( [ ec8 ] ) ) .",
    "this kind of function has also been used to describe the behavior of systems that exhibit a dsi in its dynamic behavior@xcite . by fitting the data with equation ( [ ec8 ] ) we determine @xmath122 , a figure that is in relatively good agreement with the values obtained by other authors by performing equilibrium measurements and by applying a finite - size scaling approach@xcite .",
    "the exponent @xmath123 of the initial increase in the magnetization , determined for the segmentation step @xmath100 , appears to be the same as that for the sc(3,1 ) ( @xmath124 ) but it is only slightly smaller than the accepted value for the ising model in @xmath2 ( @xmath125 ) , suggesting that this exponent is not significantly affected by the dimensionality of the substrate .",
    "it is worth mentioning that @xmath1 is related to @xmath126 , such that @xmath127 and that the former exponent sets the time scale for the initial increase in the magnetization through @xmath128 .",
    "the second moment of the magnetization and the autocorrelation function obtained by starting the dynamic evolution from the disordered initial state follow the expected power - law behavior .",
    "this fact allows us to perform an independent determination of the exponents @xmath129 and @xmath130 , which turn out to be self - consistent with the values obtained from simulations starting from the ordered state .",
    "we would like to remark that the critical exponents corresponding to all observables measured show a convergent trend when the segmentation step is increased , indicating that the largest segmentation used in this work ( @xmath100 ) would be considered a good approximation of the mathematical fractal .",
    "our estimation @xmath131 indicates that the order parameter critical exponent for the sc(4,2 ) is smaller than that corresponding to the ising model in @xmath2 ( @xmath132 ) , which is almost the same as that reported for the case as the sc(3,1 ) ( @xmath133 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "our estimation for the exponent of the susceptibility ( @xmath134 ) is significantly larger than those corresponding to the 2d - ising magnet ( @xmath135 ) and the sc(3,1 ) for the same k ( @xmath136 ) .",
    "nevertheless , it is notably smaller than the values reported from equilibrium simulations using finite - size scaling ( @xmath137)@xcite .",
    "we hope that the present work represents an extensive attempt to not only numerically characterize the relevant critical properties of the ising model on a fractal substrate , but also to give clear evidence that the dsi of the underlying fractal structure influences the dynamic evolution of an ising magnet . of course",
    ", we have discussed the difficulties one encounters when dealing with these systems , but even more importantly our study allows us to clearly identify and characterize the influence of the substrate topology on the power - law behavior expected for the nonequilibrium critical dynamics in the short - time regime .",
    "the dsi of the fractal shows up dramatically in the dynamic behavior of the magnetization decay by causing the occurrence of logarithmic periodic oscillations .",
    "in this appendix we show that equation ( [ ec12 ] ) can be straightly proven for a certain observable @xmath47 , if one assumes :    * @xmath64 obeys a time dsi of the form : @xmath138 where p is the period and n is an integer .",
