    "nitrogen - vacancy ( n - v ) centers in diamond are a promising system for implementing and testing quantum information processing protocols in solids .",
    "spin states of single centers can be initialized and detected optically  @xcite , and this capability has been extended to controlled coupling between n - v centers and other spins ( @xmath1,@xmath2 )  @xcite .",
    "a special feature of this system is the spin - triplet structure of the ground states , with individual transitions that can in theory be manipulated independently using microwave polarization selection rules .",
    "the ground state of the negatively charged n - v center is known to have a ( @xmath3 ) spin triplet structure  @xcite which , neglecting hyperfine interactions , is described by the following electron spin hamiltonian  @xcite : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the magnetic field , @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the zero - field splitting between the lowest - energy @xmath8 sublevel , and the @xmath9 sublevels which are degenerate at zero magnetic field . in typical optically - detected magnetic resonance ( odmr )",
    "experiments , the microwave transitions are driven by linearly polarized fields , and individual transitions are selected by applying a magnetic field to lift the @xmath9 degeneracy . to avoid spin mixing , the magnetic field",
    "is usually applied along the quantization axis , which can be along any of the four @xmath10 crystal axes .    an alternative method to drive the spin transitions selectively",
    "is to take advantage of polarization selection rules , since the transitions from @xmath8 to @xmath9 occur with @xmath11 circularly polarized microwave excitation .",
    "using polarization , rather than frequency , selective excitation at zero magnetic field becomes possible , and at weak magnetic fields where transitions still overlap ( _ e.g. _ @xmath12 ) the selectivity can be improved . at small magnetic fields and under weak strain or electric field , it is expected that simultaneous cycling and non - spin - conserving optical transitions can be realized , useful for optical readout and manipulation , respectively  @xcite .",
    "therefore , high selectivity and weak magnetic fields are highly desired for improving the prospects of n - v - based quantum information processing .    here",
    "we demonstrate selective excitation of ensembles and individual n - v centers using circularly polarized microwaves for the spin transitions , and the laser polarization with respect to the n - v axis for the optical transitions .",
    "to test the selection rules experimentally , we performed optically - detected magnetic resonance ( odmr ) experiments using a microstrip resonator designed to produce circularly polarized microwaves .",
    "the cavity is formed by two crossed microstrip resonators with orthogonal modes which generate microwaves with any polarization ( from linear to circular ) when the two inputs are driven with a particular phase difference ( @xmath13 to @xmath14 ) .",
    "our cavity has a full - width half maximum ( fwhm ) resonance of @xmath15 with a quality factor of @xmath16 . to avoid distortions from the resonance shape of the cavity , the measurements were kept within the fwhm response of the cavity . after positioning the sample above the cavity center ,",
    "the resonance frequency of the cavity was trimmed by placing a low - loss dielectric above it .",
    "three different microwave polarization configurations were used : linearly polarized , clockwise ( @xmath17 ) and counterclockwise ( @xmath18 ) circular polarizations with respect to the static magnetic field .",
    "the static magnetic field was produced by a permanent magnet placed in a linear translator close to the sample .",
    "the magnetic field direction was set along the optical detection axis ( perpendicular to sample surface ) .",
    "apart from the microwave polarization control , the techniques used here are similar to those used in previous room - temperature odmr experiments  @xcite .",
    "[ sample100](a ) shows a schematic for our experimental setup , showing the sample position above the cavity , as well as the cavity design .",
    "we used a confocal setup in which an excitation laser ( @xmath19 ) was focused to a sub - micron spot inside the sample for non - resonant excitation of the n - v centers .",
    "this setup also allowed for the control of the laser polarization incident on the sample .",
    "laser excitation produces a spin polarization , preferentially populating the @xmath8 ground state .",
    "when the applied microwave field with the appropriate polarization is resonant with one of the spin transitions , the spin polarization decreases , producing a measurable decrease in the photoluminescence intensity .",
    "the first set of measurements ( fig .",
    "[ sample100 ] ) was performed on a @xmath20 $ ] oriented sample with a relatively high @xmath21 concentration of n - v centers near the surface . for this crystal orientation , none of the four possible n - v orientations ( fig .",
    "[ sample100](c ) , inset ) have their quantization axes parallel to the surface normal , and hence a circular polarization in the laboratory frame of reference has an elliptical projection onto a plane perpendicular to the n - v axis .",
    "however the odmr spectrum is the simplest for this crystal orientation because for each n - v orientation the absolute angle between the quantization axis and the surface normal is the same .",
    "the normalized transition probabilities between @xmath8 to @xmath22 are calculated theoretically to be @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively .    for a quantitative verification of the selection rules we would ideally perform measurements in a regime where the microwave power dependence of the odmr spectrum is linear .",
    "the odmr signal dependence on the microwave power excitation can be phenomenologically described by @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the -3db saturation level .",
    "figure [ sample100](b ) shows a measurement of the resonance amplitude ratio between the two transitions ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) as a function of applied microwave power . the solid line is a fit using the ratio between the two transitions , @xmath29 ( for the @xmath11 microwave polarization ) , where in the low power limit the ratio is @xmath30 . with these assumptions",
    "the saturation power for @xmath31 is @xmath32 .",
    "our measurements were done at @xmath33 , since the time required to perform the experiment below the saturation limit at the same signal to noise ratio would be prohibitively long .",
    "figure [ sample100](c ) shows esr spectra measured for three microwave polarizations , showing two peaks corresponding to the @xmath9 transitions .",
    "the solid lines are the calculated spectra solving eq .",
    "[ eq_electron ] over the 4 possible n - v orientations , considering an inhomogeneous broadening of @xmath34 ( obtained from the measured data ) for each transition .",
    "the model does not include the saturation behavior .",
    "circularly polarized microwave excitation produced a constrast ratio greater than @xmath35 between the two odmr peaks . in the linearly polarized spectrum ( shifted for clarity ) , the slight asymmetry is due to the cavity response .",
    "next , we describe measurements performed on a @xmath36$]-oriented sample with a much lower n - v concentration , below @xmath37 . for this crystal orientation , from four possible n - v orientations ( see fig .",
    "[ hyperfine](a ) ) , one of them ( @xmath36 $ ] , labeled `` nv1 '' ) is normal to the sample surface and is expected theoretically to exhibit perfect selection rules . for the other orientations the projected microwave field is elliptical in the n - v reference frame , and the circular selection rules are not fully observed .",
    "thus , this measurement can reveal the orientation of a particular center . for this experimental configuration ,",
    "the zeeman splitting depends on the n - v orientation , decreasing by a factor of approximately @xmath38 for n - v orientations other than @xmath36 $ ] .    due to the high purity of this sample",
    ", hyperfine structure can be resolved in the odmr spectrum . for a substitutional @xmath39 with nuclear spin @xmath40 ,",
    "the hamiltonian terms describing the nuclear zeeman , hyperfine and quadrupole interactions are  @xcite : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the nuclear magneton , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the hyperfine constants and @xmath45 is the quadrupole splitting .",
    "previous work  @xcite has established these constants to be : @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 . for small static magnetic fields ,",
    "the hyperfine interaction splits each of the two odmr peaks into a triplet with splittings of approximately @xmath50 . in this limit",
    ", each component of a triplet follows approximately the original circular polarization selection rules .",
    "the ensemble odmr spectra in fig .",
    "[ hyperfine](b ) , which show the hyperfine structure , were obtained by removing the pinhole from the collection optics to reduce spatial selectivity , and exciting with small optical and microwave powers . measured and calculated spectra using eq .",
    "[ eq_hyperfine ] are shown .",
    "the calculation includes all possible transitions , weighted by their predicted strengths , using a lorentz function ( @xmath51 linewidth ) to account for inhomogeneous broadening . for each panel in [ hyperfine](b ) , the color scale represents the esr intensity as a function of the static magnetic field ( x - axis ) and the microwave frequency ( y - axis ) for the three different microwave polarizations .",
    "two different slopes are observed for the zeeman splitting , corresponding to n - v centers oriented along @xmath36 $ ] ( steeper slope ) and the other three orientations .",
    "these results exhibit good agreement between theory and experiment .",
    "for the n - v centers oriented along @xmath36 $ ] , the measured contrast ratio for @xmath31 vs. @xmath52 excitation is approximately 9 .      for work on single n - v centers ,",
    "it is helpful to have a simple method to determine the orientation of the n - v axis . here ,",
    "we demonstrate a method based on optical polarization dependence .",
    "since the dipole moments of the optical transitions are perpendicular to the n - v axis , the optical polarization anisotropy depends on orientation  @xcite . for a @xmath36 $ ] sample",
    ", all four orientations can be distinguished optically , allowing rapid identification of many n - v centers through polarized scanning confocal imaging . for effecient representation of the data",
    ", we combine many images obtained with different excitation polarizations into a single image by encoding polarization into color according to the following filter function : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the multiplication factor for color channel @xmath55 , @xmath56 is the polarization angle , @xmath57 is an offset chosen as small as possible to maximize color saturation without producing negative pixel values , and @xmath58 is an angle offset which controls hue .",
    "this procedure is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ laser_pol](a ) , where the first three panels show images obtained at the particular polarizations for which n - v orientations nv2 , nv3 , and nv4 have photoluminescence minima .",
    "the colors of these individual images correspond to the encoding in eq .",
    "[ eq_filter ] .",
    "the insets show the relative orientation of the laser polarization ( @xmath59 ) with respect to these three n - v axes .",
    "the minima occur when the projection of the n - v axis onto the sample surface is parallel to the electric field of the optical excitation .",
    "the last panel shows the combined image in which the four orientations can be clearly distinguished by color .",
    "based on photon correlation measurements , we can unambiguously associate the individual spots with single n - v centers .",
    "the optical polarization dependence of four representative n - v centers is shown in fig  [ laser_pol](b ) , fitted to a simple model .",
    "this model includes the effect of n - v orientation on both the excitation rate and the photoluminescence collection efficiency . for an n - v center oriented normal to the sample surface ( nv1 ) , the two dipole moments ( perpendicular to the n - v axis ) can be excited equally by the laser .",
    "experimentally , for this orientation we observe that the photoluminescence is approximately unpolarized , independent of the excitation polarization ( not shown ) . therefore in the model",
    "we assume that the two dipole moments of the n - v center radiate with equal intensity , independent of which dipole moment is excited by the laser , a situation that would occur if relaxation between the excited states is fast at room temperature . when both polarizations are detected as in fig  [ laser_pol](b ) , the other orientations ( nv2 , nv3",
    ", nv4 ) produce a weaker photoluminescence signal even at maximum excitation efficiency since the collection efficiency is reduced for this geometry .",
    "the model also includes saturation of the optical transitions ( measured in fig  [ laser_pol](c ) ) and asymmetry in the collection efficiency in our setup for light polarized parallel or perpendicular to the laser polarization . taking all of these factors into account",
    ", we obtain good agreement between theory and experiment .",
    "finally , using the method above to locate single n - v centers of known orientation , we proceed to test their microwave polarization selection rules .",
    "the odmr spectra for single n - v centers with nv1 and nv2 orientations are shown in fig .",
    "[ single ] , with data ( filled symbols ) and fits ( solid lines ) . in fig .",
    "[ single](a ) the fit used a superposition of two gaussian curves corresponding to the two microwave transitions , while in fig .",
    "[ single](b ) the fit used a single gaussian since , for the smaller zeeman splitting , the transitions are unresolved .",
    "for nv1 we expect perfect selectivity , characterized by a forbidden transition from @xmath60 to @xmath61 under @xmath31 excitation .",
    "experimentally , we observe a residual peak in this case with approximately 15% relative intensity which is most likely due to imperfect generation of circularly polarized microwave fields above the cavity , or even the parasitic effect of the trimming dielectric , sample shape and microscope objective .",
    "simulations predict that if the measurement location is just a few millimeters away from the cavity center , some ellipticity can occur .",
    "for the nv2 orientation , although the zeeman splitting is not resolved , exciting with circular microwave polarization causes a narrowing of the transition linewidth compared with linearly polarized excitation , and a shift of the peak center is also observed , showing that the circular polarization favors one transition . theoretically , we expect the zeeman splitting for the nv2 orientation to be smaller by a factor of 3 .",
    "we also expect reduced polarization selectivity due to the large angle between the n - v axis and the microwave polarization axis , with an additional contribution from the cross - polarized transition of @xmath62 amplitude .",
    "in summary , we have experimentally verified spin polarization selection rules for n - v centers in diamond with various crystal and n - v orientations using circularly polarized microwave excitation .",
    "the results , including hyperfine structure , are consistent with theory .",
    "we have also demonstrated an efficient optical method for determining orientations of single n - v centers , and demonstrated microwave polarization selection rules in single n - v centers of known orientation . by optimizing the relative amplitudes and phases of the signals used to drive the two inputs of the microwave cavity , a much higher selectivity is possible .",
    "even for the case of the @xmath20 $ ] oriented sample , for a single n - v center , elliptically polarized excitation could in principle give perfect selectively .",
    "therefore we expect that microwave polarization selection rules will prove quite useful for spin manipulation , initialization and tomography of single n - v centers when improved selectively or operation at zero static magnetic field are needed .",
