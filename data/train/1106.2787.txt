    "understanding how nanocomponents spontaneously organize into complex macroscopic structures is one of the great challenges in the field of soft matter today .",
    "indeed , the ability to predict and control the phase behavior of a solution , given a set of components , may open the way to the development of materials with novel optical , mechanical , and electronic properties . despite much effort in this direction , the question of how to link the physical character of the components , i.e. their bare shape and their interaction potential , to their phase behavior still remains unanswered .    of particular interest for optical applications",
    "are the crystalline phases .",
    "until recently , it was believed that shape anisotropy and/or directional interactions where key elements for the formation of crystals with complex symmetries commonly observed for instance in atomic solids .",
    "the study of the phase behavior of components interacting with exotic ( yet isotropic ) potentials has proven this belief to be incorrect .",
    "for instance , torquato _ et al .",
    "_ have shown , using inverse optimization techniques , that it is possible to achieve non - closed - packed structures such as simple cubic , hexagonal , wurtzite and even diamond phases with isotropic pair potentials ( see ref  @xcite for a review on the subject ) .",
    "furthermore , spherical particles interacting via a hard core and a repulsive shoulder potential are known to organize into complex mesophases not unlike those found with diblock copolymers  @xcite .",
    "one class of pair potentials that has recently attracted much attention is that describing the interactions between soft / deformable mesoparticles . unlike typical colloidal particles for which excluded volume interactions",
    "are strictly enforced via a hard - core or a lennard - jones potential , complex mesoparticles such as charged or neutral star polymers , dendrimers or microgels present a more peculiar pair potential describing their volume interactions .",
    "surprisingly , the simple relaxation of the constraint of mutual impenetrability between isotropic components gives access to several non - close - packed crystalline structures at high densities .",
    "given the complexity of these mesoparticles , their interactions are usually extracted via an explicit coarse - grained procedure to obtain ad - hoc effective pair potentials .",
    "what emerges is a great variety of nontrivial interactions , some of which allow for even complete overlap among the components , resulting in a very rich phenomenological behavior .",
    "remarkably , it is feasible to engineer interactions between star polymers or dendrimers by controlling their overall chemical / topological properties  @xcite .",
    "the phase behavior of several systems adopting these exotic , but physically inspired , interactions has been the subject of several publications  @xcite .",
    "notably , it was found that some classes of soft interactions lead to reentrant melting transitions , others to polymorphic cluster phases  @xcite , and in general to multiple transitions involving close - packed and non - close - packed crystalline phases  @xcite as a function of the system density .",
    "remarkably , the phase behavior of these systems is very much dependent on the the shape of the pair potential .",
    "likos et al .",
    "@xcite established a criterion to predict whether for a bounded and repulsive potential reentrant melting or cluster phases will occur based on the sign of the fourier transform of the interaction .",
    "nevertheless , there is currently no method to predict _ a priori _ what specific crystal structures may become accessible for a given potential . for a recent review on the subject we refer the reader to reference  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we focus on two - dimensional systems .",
    "although much of the research in this field has focused on three - dimensional systems , earlier numerical work on particles interacting via a hard core plus a shoulder potential in two dimensions has revealed a phenomenological behavior that can be as rich as that observed at higher dimensionality  @xcite .",
    "here we focus on bounded soft potentials . specifically , expanding on our recent results on hertzian spheres  @xcite and dumbbells  @xcite in three dimensions , we analyze the phase behavior of soft elastic particles in two dimensions . we generalize our results to spherical surfaces , and discuss the generalized thomson problem for our soft potentials by identifying novel polyhedral structures representing minimal energy configurations formed by soft particles constrained on the surface of a sphere at different packing densities .",
    "to study the phase behavior of soft nanoparticles in two dimensions we performed numerical simulations .",
    "we considered systems of at least @xmath1 spherical particles and used the standard monte carlo method in the npt and nvt ensemble for the planar and spherical case respectively .",
    "all simulations where run for a minimum of @xmath2 iterations .",
    "any two particles in our system interact via a hertz potential .",
    "the hertz potential describes the elastic energy penalty associated with an axial compression of two deformable spheres .",
    "its functional form can be generalized as follows @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the particle diameter , @xmath5 is the interparticle distance , @xmath6 is the unit of energy , and @xmath7 is a parameter that we control to modulate the shape of the interaction . the elastic case is recovered for @xmath8 .    the hertz model , developed to account for small elastic deformations , becomes inaccurate when associated to the large overlaps among particles that is achieved at large densities ; nevertheless , it provides us with a simple representation of a finite - ranged , bounded soft potential with a positive definite fourier transform ( a condition that guarantees reentrant melting in the phase diagram . ) we included in our study two more values of @xmath7 to account for a slightly harder ( @xmath9 ) and a slightly weaker ( @xmath10 ) potential than the elastic one ( @xmath8 . )",
    "figure  [ pot ] shows these potentials .",
    "crystallization in our simulations was determined using a combination of visual inspection and numerical order parameters similar to those described in  @xcite .",
    "specifically , given a randomly chosen particle @xmath11 , and a reference direction set to be along the bond between this particle and one of its nearest neighbors , we can define an order parameter sensitive to a crystal of @xmath12-fold symmetry ( specifically six - fold hexagonal and four - fold square crystals ) as follows : for all particles @xmath13 within a radius of some cutoff @xmath14 of @xmath11 ( including @xmath11 itself ) , we calculate the angle @xmath15 between the bond joining each of the @xmath12 nearest neighbors @xmath16 of @xmath13 to @xmath13 and the reference direction . if the number of particles within @xmath14 of @xmath11 is @xmath17 , then the order parameter @xmath18 is given by : this process is then repeated @xmath19 times and an average @xmath20 is calculated , yielding a value between @xmath21 ( for completely disordered systems ) and @xmath22 ( for perfectly crystalline systems ) .",
    "this order parameter is analogous to that defined in  @xcite except that instead of @xmath23 being an average over all particles @xmath13 in the system , it is only over particles @xmath13 within @xmath14 ( @xmath24 in our case ) ; thus it is `` semi - local '' and allows crystalline order to be detected even in the presence of metastable grain boundaries .",

    "the lines separating the different regions are guides to the eye . given the peculiarities of phase transitions in two dimensions , and the richness in the phases behavior reported , we have not attempted to establish equilibrium boundaries between the different phases , yet we have reproduced our results using molecular dynamics simulations with a langevin thermostat performed in key regions of the phase space , and compared the stability of the crystalline structures by measuring their relative energies at @xmath30 .",

    "as expected from likos s criterion  @xcite our system shows reentrant melting behavior and a highest temperature above which the system remains fluid at all densities .",

    "interestingly , the occurrence of the two phases has an alternating periodic pattern , and no isostructural transition was detected in our system  @xcite .",

    "given that the only other competing structure at large values of @xmath7 is the square lattice , we computed the energy density difference between hexagonal and square lattices as a function of density and at zero temperature for different values of @xmath7 .",

    "given the structural variety observed in the two dimensional compression of soft nanoparticles , it is interesting to extend our results to other geometries .",
    "the spherical case is of particular interest because a large body of work has been dedicated to finding and enumerating minimal energy conformations of particles constrained over a spherical shell , and repelling each other via an electrostatic repulsion  @xcite .",
    "this is what thomson asked in 1904  @xcite when attempting to construct his plum pudding model of the atom .",
    "although there is consensus on the minimal energy structures for @xmath45 , the problem becomes more involved for large values of @xmath19 for which an exponentially large number of low energy configurations becomes available . in this regime , lattices with overall icosahedral symmetry ( _ icosadeltahedra _ ) have been initially postulated as possible global minima for specific magic number of particles  @xcite , but eventually it was shown that it is possible to lower the energy of these configurations adding dislocation defects  @xcite .",
    "grain boundary scars have also been observed in experiments  @xcite .",
    "although we confirm that the same pattern of phases obtained in two dimensions also develops on large areas of spherical shells ",
    "apart from the topologically required defects  as a function of the radius of the sphere ( see fig .  [ spheres ] for a sample of these configurations ) , we have not attempted to enumerate all possible low energy states for large @xmath19 .",
