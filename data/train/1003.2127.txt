    "one of the interesting phenomena in high energy collisions is the production of _ soft _ particles with low momenta .",
    "it is usually described in the existing monte carlo models by a non - perturbative mechanism which transforms the partonic final state into a corresponding final state of hadrons .",
    "best understood is the @xmath0 process where the primarily produced @xmath16 pair evolves into a partonic cascade and finally into hadrons .",
    "a similar description applies to the hadronic collisions with the high @xmath17 jets , where the partonic cascades are initiated by the _ active _ partons and the parton _",
    "spectators _ ; also an incoherent superposition of such processes could become important at high energies in the tev region . in nuclear collisions",
    "the collective phenomena play an important role as well .",
    "this paper is focused on the universal feature of the soft ( @xmath1 ) particle production in all these collision processes which is based on the universality of the soft gluon bremsstrahlung with the intensity depending on the directions and colour charges of the participating partons but not on the collision energy . from this point of view the perturbative analysis of the quark gluon cascade ( see , for example , @xcite )",
    "is naturally combined with the idea of a close similarity between the parton and hadron spectra ( `` local parton hadron duality '' - lphd @xcite ) .",
    "such a scenario is deeply rooted in the space - time picture of the parton - cascade development and hadronization , see @xcite . this approach has been developed and tested in details for the hadronic final states in @xmath0 annihilation verifying , in particular , the energy independence of the soft limit and the expected dependence on the primary colour charges ( quark or gluon jets ) , but it should also be applicable to other hard processes including @xmath18 and @xmath4 @xmath19 collisions with high @xmath17 particle production , where the soft particles belong to the `` underlying event '' @xcite  -  @xcite .",
    "a distinct dependence on the primary colour charges makes this approach quite different from the simple process - independent universality , for example , of a thermodynamical origin .    here , we are extending this approach to the description of the so - called `` minimum bias '' events in the hadronic and nuclear collisions where we expect similar effects generated by the primary soft gluon bremsstrahlung .",
    "note , first , that it is plausible to expect that at high energies the bulk of the soft particles originates in a semihard process from the fragmentation of the so - called minijets , which are produced by the perturbative mechanism similar to the @xmath0 case .",
    "next , recall that the perturbative dynamics results in the limiting behaviour of the soft particle densities , since the radiation of soft gluons from several quarks and gluons develops in a coherent way : different sources of secondaries should act as a single source with an effective colour ` charge ' equal to the _ vector _ sum of all the colour ` charges ' , since a gluon with a large wave - length can not resolve the smaller details ( individual elements of the ` colour antenna ' ) .",
    "it is worth emphasizing also that the low momentum hadrons are formed at the initial stage , before the formation of fast particles @xcite .",
    "thus , the low-@xmath20 hadrons emitted at small rapidities in the centre - of - mass frame ( @xmath21 ) bear no information about the complicated structure of the whole event , in particular , about the secondaries in the fragmentation regions and the properties of the initial hadrons .",
    "it is natural to expect the analogous interference phenomena in the light hadron ( pion ) emission , when the particle inverse momentum , @xmath22 , which is a characteristics of the resolution , exceeds the size of the interaction region .",
    "thus , we should observe the limiting behaviour in the soft particle densities in the proton - proton , proton - nuclear and nuclear - nuclear collisions similar to that observed in the @xmath0 annihilation .",
    "all these processes can be characterized by the limiting density @xmath23 of the soft particle spectra @xcite at vanishing rapidity @xmath24 and @xmath17 , not to the double - side limit @xmath25 @xmath26 in the case of @xmath0 annihilation the normalization cross section is @xmath27 , while for the @xmath4 and nuclear collisions the rates are often normalized by @xmath28= @xmath29 . however , for the studies of soft particle production it is more appropriate to use for normalization another quantity , namely the so - called non - diffractive cross section , @xmath30 , defined as @xmath30= @xmath31 .",
    "here @xmath32 describes the corresponding contribution from the single diffractive and double diffractive dissociation . strictly speaking ,",
    "@xmath32 depends on the collision energy ( see , for example , a compilation in ref.@xcite and the analysis in @xcite ) .",
    "however , this energy variation is within the uncertainties of the current data , and it is plausible to evaluate the non - diffractive cross section @xmath30 as being 10% lower than @xmath28 .",
    "note also , that here and in what follows the quantity @xmath23 is defined as the density averaged over the charged is 7% lower . ] particles [ @xmath33 ) ] .",
    "after recalling the relevant observations for the @xmath0 collisions we will turn to the study of the limiting behaviour of the density ( [ invcs ] ) in the @xmath4 and @xmath34 collisions .",
    "we assume that these processes are initiated by the gluon exchanges , but more general configurations are possible .",
    "the relation between parton and hadron final states is formulated at first for inclusive observables such as we discuss here .",
    "it is an interesting question how such relations can be realised by the exclusive final states including resonances . in the limit",
    "@xmath1 soft gluons in the cascade add coherently and are represented by the born term ; likewise the soft pions from a general final state should add coherently to yield the energy independent density .",
    "analogies between the bremsstrahlung in qed and multiple particle production in hadronic collisions date back to the pre - qcd times @xcite and has lead in particular to the concept of _ flat rapidity plateau_. within qcd such an analogy was further developed @xcite and the picture with one - gluon exchange initiating high energy @xmath4 collisions has appeared @xcite",
    ". the present qcd - based approach relates hadrons to the full quark - gluon cascade which generates particle jets , and the `` classical '' bremsstrahlung born term is dominant only in the ultrasoft limit @xmath5 .",
    "let us start from recalling the behaviour of the momentum spectrum of particles in @xmath0 annihilation in the soft limit as the benchmark reaction . in this process",
    "it is convenient to measure the inclusive momentum spectrum since this does not require a determination of the jet axis which is needed for the spectra defined in terms of @xmath24 and @xmath17 .",
    "the existing data can be well described within the modified leading logarithmic approximation ( mlla ) for the qcd parton cascade together with lphd for the description of hadrons ( see , for instance @xcite ) . for the very low momenta a model dependent prescription",
    "is applied allowing to account for the mass effects .",
    "the perturbative expansion of the momentum spectrum of partons can be derived by an iteration of the born term in the respective evolution equation .",
    "the first term in mlla has the form @xcite @xmath35 while the higher @xmath36 corrections , which depend on the primary energy , vanish as @xmath37 @xmath38 when the transverse momentum of the gluon , @xmath39 , aproaches its minimum ( cut - off ) value @xmath40 . here",
    "@xmath41 is the multiplicity of gluons emitted by the configuration with the gluon ( @xmath42 ) or quark ( @xmath43 ) colour charge ; @xmath44 , momentum fraction carried by the gluon is denoted as @xmath45 and qcd scale - as @xmath46 . in this limit",
    "the born term remains and it is independent of primary energy and directly proportional to the colour factors .",
    "these features stay unchanged if the spectra are slightly modified at low momentum within lphd to include particles with mass and one arrives at the perturbative expectation for the limiting behaviour @xcite @xmath47 in this limit the gluon has a large wave - length and only resolves the primarily produced partons , a radiation process represented by the born term .",
    "another feature of the approximation ( [ born ] ) is the `` flat rapidity plateau '' , that is , the independence at fixed @xmath39 of the particle density on @xmath48 or angular rapidity @xmath24 .",
    "this approximation is true as far as we neglect the kinematical ( threshold ) effects , when at large @xmath24 the energy of the observed secondary particle becomes comparable with the energy of the initial interaction .",
    "the available data show , that at the lowest accessible particle momenta , around @xmath49  gev , the invariant density @xmath50 for pions rises only by about 20% over the @xmath21 energy range @xmath51 gev , and with increasing momentum @xmath20 this rise becomes stronger , see @xcite  -  @xcite .",
    "the mlla formulae provide a rather good fit of the total energy and momentum dependence of the observed one - particle spectrum , and clearly demonstrate the approach towards energy independence of the spectrum as in the limit ( [ constlim ] ) .",
    "therefore , the observed rise of the particle density at mid - rapidities and the rise of the overall multiplicity with energy increasing is caused by the high @xmath17 particles .",
    "note that in the soft limit @xmath1 one obtains @xmath52 since the invariant particle distribution approaches a constant value .",
    "the second important lesson from the @xmath0 data concerns the dependence of the soft particle density on the primary colour charges , that is , on the difference between the primary quark - antiquark and the gluon - gluon colour antennae - dipoles .",
    "this was confirmed by the study of 3-jet ( @xmath53 ) events at different inter - jet angles . in the limit when the gluon is parallel to a quark ( antiquark )",
    "the soft radiation pattern is the same as that in the case of a @xmath16 dipole , since the soft gluon can not resolve the parallel quark and gluon . on the other hand ,",
    "if the @xmath16 system recoils against the gluon , it is seen by the emitted soft gluon as a colour octet source .",
    "then the soft radiation density in these two limiting cases should differ by the ratio of colour factors @xmath54 with @xmath55 , in agreement with ( [ born ] ) .",
    "experimentally , one can not reach these extreme limits but we can derive predictions on how the soft radiation density perpendicular to the event plane in the 3-jet event varies with the inter - jet angles between the two extremes @xcite .",
    "these expectations are well confirmed by the delphi data @xcite which successfully reproduce the ratio ( [ ggtoqq ] ) .",
    "note that the corresponding ratio for the global quark and gluon jet multiplicities strongly deviates from ( [ ggtoqq ] ) because of the influence of the particles with higher @xmath17 and the importance of higher orders in the perturbative mlla calculation .",
    "neglecting the effects of order of @xmath56 , the primary @xmath57 antenna can be represented by the two @xmath16 dipoles , where the gluon is replaced by the parallel @xmath58 and @xmath59 . in this approximation",
    "the ratio ( [ ggtoqq ] ) becomes @xmath60 , corresponding to the number of radiating dipoles .",
    "the radiation of soft gluons perpendicular to the dipole varies with the opening angle @xmath61 as @xmath62 .",
    "the experimental results demonstrate that the soft particle density follows the lowest order qcd expectations for the given configuration of colour charges , see for a review @xcite .",
    "in analogy to the @xmath0 process , let us start from the minimal partonic process , which can be responsible for the very soft gluon bremsstrahlung .",
    "we assume here that the underlying physics of the minimum bias events is based on the collisions of two partons within the protons .",
    "the partonic process of lowest perturbative order corresponds to one gluon exchange , which leads to a dominantly small scattering angle and a non - vanishing cross section at high energies . in the case of elastic scattering between the two incoming quarks the exchange of the @xmath63-channel gluon",
    "rearranges the incoming colours and creates the outgoing colour charges which leads to the radiation of the soft gluons from the effective colour octet dipole . for a large number of colours in the above - mentioned approximation",
    "this radiation can be described as being generated by a superposition of the _ two _ aligned dipoles . in the case of small - angle scattering",
    "the same soft gluon radiation pattern appears also with the incoming quarks replaced by gluons , as can be explicitly seen from the radiation patterns given in @xcite .",
    "therefore , the limiting soft radiation densities in the @xmath4 and @xmath0 collisions should differ by a factor of @xmath64 at all energies , as in the ratio in eq .",
    "( [ ggtoqq ] ) for the spectra induced by the @xmath65 and @xmath16 dipoles .    for a similar reason",
    "the particle multiplicity ratio for the two processes is expected to be equal to the same quantity @xmath66 @xcite . in our case",
    ", we anticipate that this qcd expectation could be valid only in a specific soft limiting case , while as we discuss , the @xmath17-behaviour of the spectra in both processes are different and energy dependent , therefore the total multiplicities should differ as well .    one can also consider more complex situations corresponding to the multiple gluon exchange . however , if there is a multiple gluon exchange between the pair of quarks , then the total colour of the exchanged system could be only an octet or a singlet ; since the singlet exchange rather corresponds to a diffractive process , its contribution to the central production is negligible , and we come back to the previous case . if the multiple gluon exchange involves both quarks and spectator diquarks , but does not destroy the diquark , ( which acts as a local object ) , then the colour of the quark - diquark system can be either an octet or a singlet , and , thus , again after the multiple gluon exchange this generates in the @xmath63-channel only the octet colour flow . finally , recall that in the case of more complicated diagrams the dominant leading logarithmic contribution in both the dglap and bfkl evolutions also corresponds to the colour octet exchange . in the early discussions @xcite several specific models were proposed , which predicted the ratio of the central rapidity particle densities in the @xmath4 and @xmath0 collisions . in these models the final state in @xmath4-interactions",
    "is constructed from the two chains of particles connecting @xmath58 and @xmath67 while there is one chain between @xmath58 and @xmath59 in @xmath0 collisions , but the ratio of these densities in both processes depends on the amount of overlap between both of the chains and can vary between one and two .",
    "later on , the semi - hard gluon bremsstrahlung has been included in the models and this leads to a rapidity plateau rising with energy , and a simple relation between both processes fades away .",
    "an application of the lund model to hadronic scattering at the energies below isr was discussed in @xcite , where the same one - string description was used for both , @xmath0 and @xmath4 collisions .    at higher energies",
    "this scenario should be modified in order to incorporate the multiple interactions ( mi ) of partons ( that is simultaneous interactions of two or more pairs of partons ) and minijet formation , which would lead to a certain energy growth of @xmath23 , for recent development based on the dipole cascades and multiple collisions , see @xcite .",
    "current monte carlo models include the mi option , which in terms of a simple eikonal model for soft @xmath4-scattering , where one interaction corresponds to the exchange of a cut _ bare _ pomeron , is described by the contribution of the few cut pomerons .",
    "particle density produced in the central region by one cut pomeron is energy independent . , the approximately constant behaviour results from a compensation between the growth of the gluon density @xmath68 with decreasing momentum fraction @xmath69 and an increase of a cutoff @xmath70 . ] recall , that the cross section of hard subprocess is @xmath71 .",
    "however , in the gribov - regge theory the mean number of mis , that is the number of cut pomerons , increases as @xmath72 , where the bare pomeron intercept is @xmath73 ( in terms of the gluon density @xmath68 we identify @xmath74 ) . , which is in agreement with the resummed nll bfkl result , for example @xcite .",
    "] this is the well known agk result @xcite  single particle inclusive cross section is described just by one pomeron exchange , and , thanks to the agk cancellation , there is no absorptive corrections .",
    "therefore , we arrive at @xmath75 , while the growth of inelastic cross section is reduced by the absorptive effects ( asymptotically instead of @xmath76 we should reach the froisart limit @xmath77 ) .",
    "phenomenologically , the energy behaviour of @xmath28 is close to @xmath78 with @xmath79 .",
    "thus , the particle density @xmath80 , and this growth with energy reflects the increasing number of mis , which act in the present monte carlo models incoherently .",
    "an account of the coherence effect should diminish the multiplicity of low @xmath17-secondaries produced by mi .",
    "an explicit computation @xcite using perugia p0 tune @xcite of the pythia mc model , shows that in the @xmath21 energy interval @xmath81 gev the invariant density in the @xmath4 collisions @xmath50 in the range @xmath82 gev and @xmath83 is rising by a factor of about 2 .",
    "other , more aggressive , tunes may result in even higher rise , up to a factor of 3 at most . as we discussed above , without incorporation of coherence",
    ", such increase should hold on up to the asymptotic energies .    finally , from such simple properties as eq .",
    "( [ ratio94 ] ) one should not conclude that these two processes are intrinsically very similar beyond the considered limit @xmath5 and , indeed , the above models show very different phenomena .",
    "in fact , the event structure of a 2-jet system in @xmath0 annihilation is not the same as that of a system with two ( q - qq ) pairs in @xmath4 collisions with its much larger fluctuation properties . however , in the considered limit , the produced partons ( q - qq ) are resolved as an extended colour octet source with the enhanced radiation according to eq .",
    "( [ ratio94 ] ) .",
    "such intuitive limits may help to understand the low @xmath17 production based on a perturbative ansatz .      for @xmath4 interactions in case of the minimal model discussed above the soft radiation pattern",
    "should again be energy independent analogously to the @xmath0 case , but with the intensity about a factor of two higher .",
    "we are analyzing below the @xmath17-spectra in @xmath4 collisions in order to determine the quantity @xmath23 for @xmath5 at the central rapidity @xmath84 , as defined by relation ( [ invcs ] ) .",
    "the previous analysis of the invariant cross section @xmath85 in the @xmath17-range @xmath86 gev indicated a moderate rise with energy increasing from the isr to the s@xmath87s colliders , see ref .",
    "later on , further data from cdf at the tevatron at higher energies up to 1800 gev @xcite and from rhic became available , which required a fresh look at this problem .",
    "the inclusive spectra were measured down to the transverse momenta of @xmath88  gev .",
    "some experimental groups performed fits using certain simple parametrizations of the spectra from which the quantity @xmath23 can be easily determined . the british scandinavian collaboration ( bs ) @xcite fitted the invariant cross sections at different energies between @xmath89 to 63 gev as @xmath90 while the ua1 @xcite and cdf @xcite groups used the parametrization @xmath91 from these fits the quantity ( [ invcs ] ) can be found as @xmath92 .",
    "the bs collaboration @xcite confirmed the exponential behaviour down to the pion momenta as low as @xmath93  gev .",
    "correspondingly , we derived the quantity @xmath23 from the star data @xcite using the exponential extrapolation of their charged particle spectra .    as the results depend on the function chosen for extrapolation we also considered other functional forms .",
    "the phobos  @xcite collaboration has measured the spectra down to very small @xmath94 gev in @xmath95 collisions at 200 gev .",
    "these data indicate a flattening of the distribution towards small @xmath17 according to a functional form following from a thermal model @xmath96 with @xmath97 and temperature @xmath98 as parameter .    in order to test the dependence of the extrapolated results on the choice of the function we compared the @xmath4 data of highest accuracy which is provided by the star collaboration @xcite with errors of @xmath99% to an exponential as in ( [ bsparam ] ) ( but with @xmath100 ) and the function ( [ thermal ] ) in",
    "the @xmath17 ranges 0.225 - 0.425 gev and 0.225 - 0.625 gev .",
    "we found that the extrapolated cross section at @xmath101 is reduced by 25% for the thermal fit .",
    "it should be noted that the forms ( [ bsparam ] ) and ( [ ua1param ] ) do not have the correct analytic behaviour at @xmath5 where they behave linearly in @xmath17 and the invariant cross section is not regular ; therefore , one expects to obtain an overestimate from such fits .",
    "this problem does not occur with the non - singular fits of the type ( [ thermal ] ) with quadratic behaviour in @xmath17 .",
    "experimental results over a range of energies are only available from the exponential and power like fits which we consider next . to obtain the cross section , @xmath28 , we take the total and elastic cross section data for the @xmath4 ( bs ) and @xmath87 scattering ( ua1 , cdf ) , as collected by the particle data group @xcite .",
    "the results are shown in table 1 after an interpolation . in order to determine the quantity @xmath23 for the star entry in this table , we renormalized their minimum bias data to the @xmath28 as well .    .soft",
    "limit @xmath92 from the exponential fits to the single charged - particle @xmath102 $ ] spectra in the @xmath103 collisions ; for the bs and star data we sum over the @xmath104 distributions . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     it is also interesting to compare with dis results in the current fragmentation region in the breit frame , which should correspond to the quark fragmentation similar to @xmath0 annihilation . the h1 collaboration at hera @xcite performed a study of this type at @xmath105 varying from 12 to 100 gev@xmath106 .",
    "indeed , they found that the particle density at low momenta is nearly constant .",
    "the soft limit is obtained by extrapolation of the data in energy towards @xmath107 mev , which is used as an effective mass of charged particles .",
    "extrapolating the data points at the lowest energy above @xmath108 gev to @xmath109 at @xmath110 gev we arrive at @xmath111 gev@xmath112 , which is compatible with eq .",
    "( [ i0 + - ] )",
    ". it would be interesting to analyse the recent more detailed data from zeus @xcite in a similar way .",
    "finally , we can compare with the @xmath4 collision data , using the estimates ( [ i0ppnd ] ) and ( [ i0ppndth ] ) for the non - diffractive events .",
    "then we obtain @xmath113 where the two numbers correspond to the thermal or exponential parametrization respectively .",
    "as discussed above , the evaluation based on the exponential fit may be considered as an upper limit , which would apply for a distribution without accounting for a mass effect . the uncertainty in ( [ i0pe ] ) will be largely reduced by more precise data on the spectrum at very small @xmath17 in @xmath4 collisions .",
    "the result ( [ i0pe ] ) agrees well with the expectation from the different primary quark and gluon sources in ( [ ratio94 ] ) .",
    "the approximate energy independence of the quantity @xmath23 in both collision processes , as well as the obtained ratio of the @xmath23 values in the @xmath4 and @xmath0 reactions , which is about 2 , are remarkable .",
    "this is a serious argument in favour of the relevance of the elementary bremsstrahlung process , also for the soft @xmath4 interactions .",
    "in the case of @xmath34 scattering one would naively expect , that the soft particle density is equal to that in the @xmath4-collisions times the mean number of nucleon - nucleon collisions ,  @xmath114 .",
    "such an estimate should be valid for the point - like interactions , for example , for the events with the large @xmath17 particle production , if we neglect the energy losses in the nuclear medium .",
    "however , at low momentum transfer , @xmath17 , the coherence effects should reduce the particle production , in particular , due to the destructive interference between the different amplitudes within the space domain of the size of @xmath115 .",
    "thus , we can expect the limiting behaviour when the soft particle wave - length , @xmath116 , becomes comparable with the coherence range , at most with the nuclear radius @xmath117 ( for the central @xmath34-collisions ) or with the size of the region , where two nuclei overlap , that is , for instance , for the @xmath95 collisions @xmath118 mev .",
    "inspection of the rhic data @xcite  -  @xcite shows , that , indeed , the ratio @xmath119 decreases with decreasing transverse momentum @xmath17 of the secondaries .",
    "the ratio @xmath120 ( [ rab ] ) allows to compare the particle density for the nucleus - nucleus collisions with that in the proton - proton interactions times the mean number of nucleon - nucleon collisions @xmath114 , which is calculated using the glauber model .",
    "another way used to present the rhic data is to replace the number of collisions @xmath114 by the number of nucleons participating in the interaction , @xmath9 . since in the @xmath4-collisions",
    "just two protons scatter , the normalization factor is @xmath121 rather than @xmath114 .",
    "similar to the limiting distributions , corresponding to the soft bremsstrahlung in the @xmath0 and @xmath4 processes , we , first of all , expect the energy - independent behaviour of the soft particle densities .",
    "the existing data confirm , that at low transverse momenta , @xmath122 gev , the energy dependence of the ratios @xmath123 is , indeed , quite flat . at so low @xmath17 s the ratios @xmath123 , measured by phobos @xcite at @xmath124 and 200 gev ,",

    "a convergence of the @xmath17 spectra towards low @xmath17 at the two energies can be seen , although not yet a coincidence in the observed @xmath17-range .",

    "if we extrapolate the invariant pion spectra from phenix and star by the exponential form at @xmath129 gev we arrive at @xmath130 gev@xmath112 to be compared with @xmath131 gev@xmath112 , found with the same procedure for the @xmath4 collisions @xcite . however , the phobos data at very low @xmath17 indicate a flattening of the distribution according to the functional form ( [ thermal ] ) with @xmath132 gev .",
    "fitting the phobos and star @xmath95 data for pions at @xmath129 gev using this parametrization , we obtain for the mean pion density at @xmath101 in the average @xmath133 which is about 30% lower than the result of exponential parametrization . assuming a similar fit for the low @xmath17 @xmath4 star data , we arrive at @xmath134 gev@xmath112 with @xmath135 gev , therefore , the limiting density for the nuclear collisions is more than 100 times larger than the corresponding value in the @xmath4 interactions . on the other hand , in this case",
    "the glauber model calculation  @xcite gives @xmath136 and @xmath137 ( @xmath138 ) .",
    "clearly , the soft particle density is about 10 times lower than that expected in the case of independent ( incoherent ) collisions .",
    "indeed , from the extrapolation of the @xmath17 spectra in the @xmath95 and @xmath4 collisions by either an exponential or the thermal function ( [ thermal ] ) , as presented above , we find the ratio @xmath139 which agrees with the calculated @xmath121 , and , therefore , @xmath140 here @xmath141 is defined as in ( [ rab ] ) , but with @xmath121 as a normalizing quantity .",
    "a detail experimental study was performed by phobos @xcite ( fig .",
    "32 ) for different ranges of centrality , that is , the number of participants , at the two energies 62.4 gev and 200 gev .",
    "remarkably , the ratio @xmath142 approaches about unity in the soft limit for all selections of centralities or the @xmath9 parameter .",
    "star @xcite measured the ratio @xmath143 with high precision for @xmath144 gev .",
    "it is found that this quantity decreases below @xmath145 gev and the extrapolation below the measured values of @xmath17 suggests the limiting behaviour ( [ raapart ] ) as well .",
    "that is , the data are consistent with the model where each pair of participating nucleons produces its own number of secondaries independently of the _ number of collisions _ each nucleon is participated in .",
    "this is related to the idea , that the overall characteristics of bulk particle production depend only on the number of ` wounded nucleons ' @xcite and not on the number of rescatterings .      within the bremsstrahlung scenario this result suggests that there is a coherent particle production over the range of nucleon size , but",
    "different nucleons are separated in space - time so that their contributions remain incoherent .",
    "this is in agreement with the observation that no specific structure reveals itself in the nuclear collisions at very small @xmath146 mev corresponding to the nuclear size ( see , for example , fig . 3 in @xcite with pions in this range ) .",
    "in spite of the multiple re - interactions of the same nucleon in the nucleus which proceed through the corresponding number of gluon exchanges in the minimal model for the @xmath4 collisions considered above , we still expect the limiting behaviour .",
    "the low @xmath17 particles emitted in this process interact coherently with all t - channel gluons and , actually , probe the overall colour flow originated by this ( t - channel ) system of gluons . on the other hand , as we discussed in sect .",
    "3.1 , even a large number of gluons produces dominantly the same octet colour flow as in the @xmath4 inelastic collision ( first , the octet exchange gives the dominant leading logarithmic contribution , both in the dglap and in the bfkl kinematics , next - interacting with the individual quark or with the colourless @xmath16- or quark - diquark-system we can transfer only the colour octet quantum number ) .",
    "examples of diagrams contributing in this minimal model to the production of the low @xmath17 particles in the @xmath4 and @xmath147 collisions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : aa ] . in the @xmath34 collisions re - interactions of nucleons may occur as in the @xmath147 collisions . in these depicted processes the colour flow and the associated soft particle production",
    "are determined by the number of participating nucleons irrespectively of the number of rescatterings , in agreement with the phenomenological result ( [ raapart ] ) .",
    "@xmath148    having in mind this universal mechanism for soft particle production we may ask whether there are any consequences for the relative rates of different hadron yields in the same limit . if the particles at low momenta in the hadronic and nuclear collisions are related to the universal bremsstrahlung from the ( incoherent ) superposition of primary colour octet charges , then , in this limit , the particle composition should be the same in the different processes .",
    "to the extent , that the dominant underlying mechanism in the @xmath4 collisions is the gluon exchange between the quark constituents of the proton with the initial and final bremsstrahlung , the @xmath0 and hadronic data on the particle ratios should approach each other as well .",
    "a similarity of particle ratios @xmath149 and @xmath150 in the @xmath0 and @xmath4 reactions at @xmath151 gev has been indeed noted already some time ago by the tpc collaboration @xcite . in this measurement the transverse momentum @xmath17 for the particles in @xmath0 collisions was defined with respect to the sphericity axis .",
    "the @xmath17 dependence of the particle ratios for several hadronic collisions have been compared by phenix @xcite .",
    "while at the large @xmath152 gev the ratios @xmath153 and @xmath149 tend to approach large values @xmath154 in the central @xmath95 collisions , these ratios are reduced for non - central and minimum bias @xmath4 collisions .",
    "remarkably , these ratios converge for the different processes towards lower @xmath155 gev . in fig . [",
    "fig : ratio ] we collect data in the low @xmath17 region on the ratio @xmath156 from the @xmath0 , @xmath4 and @xmath34 interactions .",
    "as one can see , the particle ratios , indeed , approach each other towards low @xmath157 gev pointing towards a dominance of multiple @xmath16 dipole radiation in all processes .",
    "an issue of universality of particle production in various collision processes predated qcd .",
    "the perturbative dynamics based on the qcd gluon bremsstrahlung suggests a particular type of universality , which , however , allows only for the predictions for the soft limit @xmath5 .",
    "this is the case , when the lowest order born term with its energy independence and elementary colour factors dominates , whereas for the larger @xmath17 s the ( non - universal ) higher order contributions take over .",
    "the predictions from this approach are confirmed with high accuracy in the @xmath0 measurements , where the energy independence of the soft particle yield is observed , and its intensity in quark and gluon jets is in agreement with the expectation from corresponding colour factors @xmath6 and @xmath158 .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the production of low momentum particles in hadronic collisions .",
    "surprisingly , the soft particle production density in the @xmath4 collisions is practically constant over the large energy range up to 1800 gev .",
    "moreover , the approximate energy independence holds also in the nuclear collisions at rhic energies .",
    "the colour factors related to the primary interaction process reveal themselves also in the comparison between the @xmath0 and @xmath4 collisions , according to a minimal model with gluon exchange in the case of hadronic processes .",
    "such a comparison would strongly benefit from more precise measurements of the low @xmath17 particle spectra in @xmath4 collisions , which could reveal the expected deviations from the exponential behaviour . in the nuclear collisions the perturbative expectations , based on the coherent bremsstrahlung in a multi - gluon exchange process",
    "lead to the energy independence of the soft particle yield .",
    "moreover , the magnitude should scale with the number of participant nucleons , @xmath9 . as a result",
    ", the yield of the low @xmath17 particles can be directly related to the soft qcd gluon bremsstrahlung from the colour charges , which are created in the primary hard or semi - hard interaction , and is proportional to @xmath159 and @xmath160 for @xmath161 and @xmath34 collisions respectively .",
    "this concept of universality is also supported by the observed convergence of the @xmath162 particle ratios in all these processes in the @xmath5 limit .    from the first sight",
    ", this seems to contradict the idea of thermalisation in the particle production .",
    "however , we recall , that according to the space - time picture of particle production , the central soft hadrons in the nucleon - nucleon @xmath21 system are those , which are formed first , and these soft particles with their large wave - length probe only the colour charges participating in the primary local interaction at a transverse size of @xmath154 f. the fast particles are formed later on , and leave the interaction region without re - scattering on the slow hadrons which stay in the interaction region",
    ". therefore , the slow particles may be not in a thermo - equilibrium with the whole hadronic system . at the very early stages following the primary interaction no re - interactions of produced hadrons from the different nucleons",
    "will take place , while the re - interactions of one nucleon with other nucleons in the nucleus should not be accounted for because of the coherent nature of soft particle emission . then",
    ", the universality of this soft particle production from the primary colour sources becomes a plausible phenomenon , since it basically reflects the universality of soft particle production from the individual isolated quark - antiquark dipoles .",
    "it will be very interesting to extend such measurements on the limiting soft particle production in @xmath4 and @xmath34 collisions to the higher energies at the lhc and to see whether any new incoherent sources appear .",
    "such measurements could set a critical benchmark for the models of multiparticle production in hadronic interactions .",
