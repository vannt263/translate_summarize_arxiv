    "the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics has proven remarkably successful at describing the phenomena observed at colliders , from the detailed properties of the gauge sector to flavor physics at bottom and charm factories . despite this unprecedented success , we know that the sm must be incomplete .",
    "two fundamental features of the observed universe can not be explained within the sm : the presence of the baryon asymmetry , and the existence of dark matter ( dm ) .",
    "the sm contains neither sufficient @xmath0 violation to produce the observed size of the baryon asymmetry , nor a particle which can act as dm .",
    "typically the solutions to these two puzzles are treated independently .",
    "observationally it is known that the dm and baryon densities are approximately the same , @xmath1 however , in most models the dm and baryon densities are not directly related to each other .",
    "for example , within the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , the near - equality of dark and visible relic densities can be accommodated as a coincidence , since @xmath2 @xmath3 violating parameters together with a tev mass scale can give rise to both a thermal relic abundance of a weakly interacting dm particle and an asymmetric relic abundance of baryonic matter , satisfying eq",
    ".  [ density ] ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "however , within the mssm , it is just as natural for the dm and baryon densities separately to be several orders of magnitude different than their observed values , so that the mssm does not explain why dark and visible densities appear to be so closely related to each other .",
    "an alternate approach is to take the dm relic density to be _ asymmetric _ , set by the asymmetry between dm and anti - dm , @xmath4 , just as the baryonic relic density .",
    "relating the dm number asymmetry to baryon number then provides a solution to the puzzle of why the dm and baryon energy densities are so close to each other .",
    "models of this type @xcite ( called asymmetric dm ( adm ) by @xcite ) have sharply different phenomenology than thermal models ; in particular , the natural scale for adm is several gev , since @xmath5 where @xmath6 is an @xmath2 number whose exact size is set by the details of the transfer mechanism",
    ". however , much heavier adm can be possible if there is a coincidence of scales , such that the dm is becoming non - relativistic just as the operator relating dark number to baryon number is decoupling , as in @xcite , or if there is a cancellation between the injected baryon , lepton and dark number asymmetries , as in @xcite .",
    "we will construct models which use both of these mass windows .    tying baryon number to dm",
    "number neatly explains the coincidence problem , but does not in itself address the _ origin _ of the asymmetry , only its distribution between sectors . in this paper",
    "we develop models of adm where the dark sector itself is responsible for generating the observed matter - antimatter asymmetry .    in order to generate a nonzero baryon asymmetry",
    ", the sakharov conditions must be satisfied @xcite :    * baryon or lepton number violation * departure from thermal equilibrium * @xmath7 and @xmath3 violation .",
    "when the dark sector is responsible for originating the asymmetry , these conditions become :    * the hidden sector must furnish a departure from thermal equilibrium ; * the hidden sector global symmetry stabilizing the dm as well as either baryon ( @xmath8 ) or lepton ( @xmath9 ) number must be broken by one or more hidden sector processes , while the couplings between the dark sector and the sm must conserve a linear combination of the dark global symmetry , @xmath10 , and/or @xmath11 ; * both @xmath7 and @xmath3 must be violated in the dark sector .",
    "we choose to focus on the scenario where the the departure from equilibrium is provided by a first - order phase transition in the dark sector , in which the sm does not directly participate .",
    "the observed matter - antimatter asymmetry is then entirely generated at this phase transition .",
    "we describe the minimal hidden sector which is capable of meeting the sakharov criteria for generating the asymmetry in the hidden sector . after the asymmetry",
    "is generated , it must be redistributed from the dark sector to the visible sector .",
    "the mechanism which transfers the asymmetry to the sm must necessarily break either baryon or lepton number , and can be either perturbative or nonperturbative .",
    "we find the most stringent constraints , perhaps not surprisingly , arise from the transfer mechanisms .",
    "finally , the hidden sector must satisfy some additional constraints in order to yield a satisfactory cosmology .",
    "in particular , the symmetric portion of the dm abundance must annihilate efficiently away @xcite , and the contribution of hidden sector states to the expansion of the universe must be minimal by the time of nucleosynthesis ; both of these conditions can be satisfied by including additional , baryon- , lepton- and dark - number preserving couplings between the hidden sector and the sm .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "( [ fig1 ] ) a schematic of the classes of models we will consider in this paper .",
    "we begin in section  [ sec : hs ] by building the minimal hidden sector which accomplishes darkogenesis . as the dark sector",
    "is relatively unconstrained , most of the constraints reside in the mechanism chosen for transferring the asymmetry between sectors , which we discuss in section  [ sec : transfer ] . in section  [ sec : models ] we build two explicit models based on the minimal hidden sector , using both perturbative and nonperturbative mechanisms for transferring the asymmetry between sectors . in section",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] , we conclude .",
    "models where the matter - antimatter asymmetry are generated from a first - order phase transition are an elegant approach to generating the observed matter abundance .",
    "the sm famously includes in principle all of the ingredients necessary for a baryon asymmetry to be generated at the electroweak phase transition , but quantitatively fails to generate the observed baryon excess .",
    "much work has been performed on extending the matter content of the sm to increase both the magnitude of the @xmath0 violation and the departure from equilibrium in order to rescue electroweak baryogenesis .",
    "some of these models also include a dm candidate , whether thermal , as in the ( n)mssm @xcite , or non - thermal , as in @xcite .",
    "we choose to focus on the less - studied scenario where the dark sector itself has a first - order phase transition in which the sm does not directly participate . in this scenario ,",
    "the necessary departure from equilibrium occurs due to the passage of supercritical bubbles of the broken phase through the plasma . in order to generate a matter - antimatter asymmetry",
    ", the other two sakharov conditions must additionally be satisfied .",
    "these can be satisfied naturally within chiral non - abelian hidden sectors .",
    "first , there must be a dark number - violating process which is efficient in the symmetric phase and suppressed in the broken phase , and which moreover shuts off faster than the timescale for the passage of the bubble wall .",
    "the requirement for the dark number - violating process to shut off precisely at the phase transition is nontrivial .",
    "the most natural candidate process is dark sphalerons , the rate for which becomes exponentially suppressed precisely at the phase transition .",
    "thus we achieve dark baryogenesis via the symmetry - breaking phase transition of a dark non - abelian gauge group , @xmath12 , and require that the dark sector contain matter fields which have a global symmetry @xmath13 which is anomalous under @xmath12 .    to summarize our scenario , we have the following :    * if the dark sector matter fields are chiral under the dark gauge group @xmath12 , this can give rise to an anomalous dark number symmetry @xmath14 under the @xmath12 .",
    "dark number violation is then achieved by dark sphalerons . *",
    "the group @xmath12 undergoes a symmetry - breaking first - order phase transition , during which time a dark matter number asymmetry is generated through the @xmath7- and @xmath0-violating interactions of the dark sector matter fields with the bubble walls . *",
    "the asymmetry generated during the phase transition is transferred to the sm through one of the mechanisms outlined in section  [ sec : transfer ] .    in our scenario @xmath7",
    "violation in the dark sector is implemented through the requirement that the global dark number @xmath13 has a chiral anomaly under the dark gauge group .",
    "we will take the hidden sector to be weakly coupled for simplicity .",
    "then the breaking of @xmath12 is accomplished through a fundamental scalar higgs boson , and the interactions of the dark sector fields with the bubble wall take the form of chiral , @xmath3 violating couplings to the dark higgs . the minimal field content in the dark sector which can satisfy all conditions consists of @xmath15 fermionic doublets of an @xmath16 gauge group , which have an anomalous number symmetry @xmath17 ; @xmath18 fermionic singlets to form dirac fermions after @xmath16-breaking ; and @xmath19 higgs doublet scalars",
    ". the number of fermionic @xmath20 doublets must be even to cancel the global anomaly . in order to yield a physical @xmath3 violating phase , we must have either @xmath21 or @xmath22 , so the minimal matter content consists of a two higgs doublet model together with 2 fermionic doublets and 4 fermionic singlets .",
    "majorana mass terms @xmath23 for doublets and @xmath24 for singlets are forbidden by the global dark number @xmath17 .",
    "this minimal hidden sector is summarized in table  [ table : su(2)content ] .",
    "since we are utilizing a fundamental scalar , it is appealing to embed these models within supersymmetry so as to make this hidden sector ( as well as the visible sector ) technically natural .",
    "the simplest dark supersymmetric sector which is chiral under @xmath25 , non - anomalous , and gives masses to all states in the dark sector is obtained simply by supersymmetrizing the minimal hidden sector of table  [ table : su(2)content ] , and is described by the superpotential @xmath26 where @xmath27 ; we suppress generational indices in eq .",
    "( [ darksuper ] ) .",
    ".matter content in the minimal hidden sector which generates a matter - antimatter asymmetry from a first - order phase transition .",
    "[ table : su(2)content ] [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     with the introduction of the messenger electroweak doublets , direct detection can now proceed via the doublet fraction of the dm state as well as through mixing between the hidden and visible higgses .",
    "the dm - neutron cross - section from the doublet component of the dm state scattering through the @xmath28 is , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is again the effective coupling of the dm to the @xmath28 via mixing with the messenger doublets .",
    "this is large enough to be constrained by monojet searches at the tevatron @xcite .",
    "our purpose in this paper was to outline the general requirements of a dark sector which can accomplish dark baryogenesis via a first order phase transition in the hidden sector .",
    "we constructed a minimal weakly coupled dark sector which generates a matter - antimatter asymmetry , and discussed messenger sectors for transferring the asymmetry to the sm .",
    "we focused on a scenario where dark number violation and out - of - equilibrium dynamics in the hidden sector can be achieved via a dark non - abelian gauge group with a first - order - phase transition , under which dark number is anomalous .",
    "the chiral anomaly of the dark number current provides @xmath7 violation , and @xmath7 and @xmath0 are both violated through chiral couplings of dark states to the dark higgses . in these models",
    "the dm mass lies in a low mass window , between approximately 1 and 15 gev , and the low symmetry - breaking scale for the dark sector can be generated dynamically via the mediation of susy breaking .",
    "we constructed an explicit dark higgs sector which satisfies the requirements for a strong first - order phase transition , and in addition provides a mechanism for successful removal of all non - asymmetric relics in the dark sector .",
    "the minimal weakly - coupled hidden sector which is the basis of our models has the special feature that the interaction strengths of all light states are determined by the ratio of their mass to the symmetry - breaking scale and the hidden sector .",
    "as the dark matter must be sufficiently strongly interacting to remove its thermal relic abundance , this structure requires low scales for the dark phase transition or additional structure in the dark sector .",
    "we showed that when this phase transition occurs below the electroweak phase transition ( so that baryon number violation through electroweak sphalerons is off ) , that the dark asymmetry can still be transferred efficiently to the baryons via a higher - dimension operator .",
    "alternatively , the dark phase transition can occur well before the electroweak phase transition . in this case , a messenger sector which carries both @xmath31 and the dark number can render dark number anomalous under @xmath31 , thereby transferring the dark asymmetry into baryons .",
    "direct detection cross sections in these models depend on small symmetric connections between the hidden sector and the visible sector , which have no intrinsic connection to the darkogenesis mechanism or the relation between the dm and baryon number .",
    "the gravitational wave signal from the first - order phase transition could provide an orthogonal probe of our darkogenesis scenario , and for transition temperatures in the interesting range from below 100 gev to 100 tev is potentially within reach at upcoming gravitational wave observatories @xcite .",
    "many other interesting and viable scenarios of darkogenesis remain to be developed .",
    "for example , @xmath3 violation could be introduced through the coupling of the dark states to the visible sector , rather than of the non - abelian hidden sector to itself . with the great freedom offered by nontrivial dark sectors ,",
    "many further novel avenues remain to explore .",
