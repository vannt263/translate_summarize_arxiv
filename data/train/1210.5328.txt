    "a major recent development in particle physics has been the observation @xcite of a significant mixing between the first and third generations of ( anti- ) neutrinos with a measured angle @xmath2 .",
    "the underlying physical implication is rather serious .",
    "certain flavor symmetries in the neutrino sector , such as that under @xmath3 interchange @xcite ( i.e. @xmath4 in relevant matrix elements ) , which imply a vanishing @xmath1 , must be broken .",
    "the latter became a highly popular idea on account of its prediction of a maximal mixing ( @xmath5 ) between the second and third generations of neutrinos  a situation still well - allowed by extant data .",
    "but , now that @xmath1 is sizably nonzero , there is interest in breaking this @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "its spontaneous breakdown generally requires @xcite several additional fields .",
    "so explicit and radiative modes of @xmath0 symmetry breaking are the only viable options with the choice of a minimal set of fields .",
    "however , radiative breaking , related to a high scale scenario with @xmath6 through renormalisation group evolution , is characterised by @xcite a small loop - induced constant proportional to @xmath7 , @xmath8 being the ew vev .",
    "the latter , even in the light neutrino mass ordering case producing the largest @xmath1 , is unable @xcite to generate a @xmath1 larger than @xmath9 which is somewhat disfavoured by the data .",
    "a reasonably minimalist approach then would be to try the explicit breaking of @xmath0 symmetry as a perturbation .",
    "we have in mind a canonical type - i seesaw @xcite mechanism for the generation of the light neutrino majorana mass matrix @xmath10 with three heavy ( @xmath11 gev ) right chiral ew singlet majorana neutrinos .",
    "we prefer to introduce the perturbation in the neutrino yukawa coupling matrix or equivalently in the neutrino dirac mass matrix @xmath12 .",
    "the latter , rather than @xmath10 , is what appears in the lagrangian .",
    "hence the present approach reflects a more basic way of handling the above explicit symmetry breaking .",
    "our next step is to study the effects of those parameters on _ predictive _ neutrino yukawa textures , specially on four and three zero @xmath0 symmetric yukawa textures of @xmath12 .",
    "such yukawa texture zeros may arise in a number of models , e.g. those with @xcite extra dimensions .",
    "it may be recalled here that the study of presumed four zero textures has had a distinguished record in the quark sector @xcite .",
    "it is thus natural to extend similar ideas to neutrinos modulo the difference due to the type - i seesaw .",
    "one can raise the issue of arbitrariness in our choice of textures , but our preference for the maximal number of zeros in the @xmath0 symmetric neutrino yukawa coupling matrix is motivated by predictivity .",
    "textures with fewer zeros have many more parameters and do not have testable predictions .",
    "any texture statement is , of course , dependent on the weak basis chosen .",
    "we select one in which the charged lepton and heavy right chiral neutrino mass matrices are real , positive and diagonal .    by an @xmath13 zero texture , what we mean here is an allowed configuration of @xmath12 with @xmath13 vanishing elements .",
    "three and four zero textures provide a predictive and useful framework @xcite within which one can discuss neutrino masses and mixing angles .",
    "as already mentioned , this utility gets much reduced for texures with a fewer number of zeros .",
    "exact @xmath0 symmetry automatically yields @xmath14 and @xmath6 .",
    "additionally , each of the allowed textures leads to an @xmath10 with three independent parameters ( two real ones and one phase ) apart from an overall mass factor .",
    "our aim here is to study deviations from these consequences of @xmath0 symmetry due to the symmetry breaking perturbation .    in deciding which @xmath0 symmetric textures",
    "are allowed and which are not , we are guided by twin criteria .",
    "first , the observed fact of none of the three light neutrinos being unmixed in flavor means that a block diagonal form of @xmath12 is inadmissible .",
    "further , if any row of @xmath12 is orthogonal , element by element ( ruling out unnatural cancellations ) to each of the other two , one neutrino family decouples  disallowing that texture .",
    "second , in the absence of any fundamental principle dictating as such , none of the neutrinos is taken to be strictly massless , i.e @xmath15 , which requires via the seesaw that @xmath16 .",
    "the presence of three heavy right chiral singlet majorana neutrinos is crucial here since , with only two , a massless neutrino is inevitable @xcite .",
    "this means that no entire row or column of @xmath12 can vanish , nor can there be in it a quartet of zeros at the corners of a rectangular array .    with the above constraints , four was shown @xcite to be the maximum number of zeros allowed in a texture of @xmath12 .",
    "all such four zero textures have been discussed extensively @xcite .",
    "these textures were further restricted @xcite drastically to four allowed ones by the imposition of @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "the four allowed textures , named @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , @xmath20 ( each pair yielding the same @xmath10 ) , were of course included in the complete list of ref .",
    "they have also been shown to be capable of leading to a desirable level of baryogenesis via leptogenesis @xcite .",
    "interestingly , allowed three zero textures of @xmath12 , when made @xmath0 symmetric , are also found to be drastically reduced in number to only two .",
    "these are designated @xmath21 and @xmath22 here , both leading to the same @xmath10 .",
    "each one of the @xmath12 textures @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 is then perturbed away from @xmath0 symmetry by deviation factors of the form @xmath23 ( no sum ) .",
    "we now call the perturbed texture @xmath24 .",
    "it should be emphasized that , while the perturbations explicitly break @xmath0 symmetry , the maximal zero texture is kept intact .",
    "the latter is our basic framework which is retained without change . here",
    "the parameters @xmath25 are real positive numbers , kept small in order that higher order terms can be neglected .",
    "further , the phases @xmath26 are unrestricted except for being between @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "because of the presence of two independent off - diagonal elements in the @xmath0 symmetric form of any of @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , only two such deviation factors are needed per texture in complete generality . in contrast , the @xmath0 symmetric form of either of @xmath33 , @xmath34 has three independent off - diagonal elements ; hence three deviation factors each have to be inserted in general in these cases .",
    "additionally , a deviation factor @xmath35 , @xmath36 being real , is introduced in the third element of the diagonal @xmath0 symmetric form of the right chiral heavy neutrino mass matrix @xmath37 .",
    "the corresponding complex symmetric light neutrino majorana mass matrix @xmath38 obtains via the type - i seesaw from the above perturbed texures .",
    "thus we have @xmath39 of course , one needs to carefully follow the interplay between the number of independent parameters in the emergent @xmath10 and the number of separate experimental inputs , as was emphasized @xcite some time ago . with the parametric form of @xmath38 for each of the six textures ,",
    "we construct the hermitian product @xmath40 through @xmath41 we directly connect with five experimentally measured quantities of phenomenological relevance , to wit @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath1 .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we outline our basic theoretical framework .",
    "section 3 contains an enumeration of the forms of the light neutrino mass matrix @xmath10 from @xmath0 symmetric allowed four zero and three zero textures .",
    "the corresponding perturbed and broken @xmath0 symmetric expression for @xmath38 in parametric form is constucted for each case in section 4 and the corresponding @xmath41 is displayed .",
    "section 5 is devoted to a phenomenological discussion of what is allowed / disallowed in the space of parameters from the five experimental inputs and which textures are in / out , given the @xmath46 ranges of those measured quantities .",
    "finally , section 6 contains a summary of our conclusions . in the appendix we provide some details of the diagonalization procedure",
    "we give a compact outline of our theoretical framework here since a major part of it was detailed earlier @xcite .",
    "we have already referred to the type - i seesaw and the h matrix in eqns.(1 ) and ( 2 ) in the introduction .",
    "these can be considered without the @xmath47 superscript in the unperturbed limit .",
    "we can write @xmath48 where we have followed the pdg convention @xcite in defining @xmath49 , @xmath50,@xmath51 . in ( [ u ] ) , @xmath52 is the unitary pmns matrix . under @xmath0 symmetry , @xmath53 , but - as mentioned earlier - the broken @xmath0 symmetric extension can be given as @xmath54 , \\label{mtbmr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is a real parameter which can have either sign . in the @xmath0 symmetric limit , @xmath55 and moreover @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 where @xmath60 can be either @xmath12 or @xmath10 .",
    "+     + on applying the twin criteria explained in the introduction and @xmath0 symmetry , only four textures of @xmath12 are found to survive .",
    "they are divided pairwise into two categories @xmath61 and @xmath62 and are individually called @xmath63 and @xmath64 . in terms of arbitrary complex quantities",
    "@xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , they can be written as @xmath68 the last two are respective transposes of the first two and the superscripts @xmath69 signifies a four zero texture .",
    "each pair in a category yields the same @xmath70 . with a reparametrisation in terms of an overall complex mass factor @xmath71 and two real positive quantities @xmath72/@xmath73 and a phase @xmath74/@xmath75 ( cf .",
    "table i ) , they appear in category @xmath76/@xmath77 as @xmath78    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ input ]    we also constrain the sum of the neutrino masses to be less than @xmath79 ev from cosmological considerations and leave the dirac phase @xmath80 of the pmns matrix @xmath52 to be unconstrained . on feeding the inputs , one can check which of the six textures can accommodate them .",
    "one universal remark can be made about the @xmath0 symmetry breaking parameters @xmath81 .",
    "we restrict them to be less than @xmath82 in magnitude so that our neglect of @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 and higher order terms is numerically justified .",
    "thus @xmath86 in general .",
    "there is nothing special about the number 0.15 which could have been 0.1 .",
    "however , we want to maximize the ranges of @xmath87 , @xmath36 though we neglect their second order contributions ; this led to our choice of 0.15 as the upper limit . among the six textures ,",
    "we find only two of them , viz . @xmath17 and @xmath21 , to survive the imposition of experimental data .",
    "the remaining four textures @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath22 are ruled out due to the following reasons . 0.1 in @xmath88 texture a2 : ruled out due to a value of @xmath89 outside the admissible range . 0.1 in @xmath88 texture b1 : ruled out due to its @xmath1 value being outside the allowed interval . 0.1 in @xmath88 texture b2 : excluded due to its @xmath44 value being outside the observed range . 0.1 in @xmath88 texture c2 : excluded owing to a @xmath1 value outside the allowed interval .",
    "0.1 in we now make some phenomenological remarks on the surviving textures @xmath17 and @xmath21 .",
    "consider @xmath17 first .",
    "the sensitivity of its three @xmath0 symmetry breaking real parameters @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath36 , cf.(8 ) , to the observable quantities is discussed below . 0.1 in ( i ) the parameter that is least sensitive to the input data , in particular the value of @xmath1 , is @xmath36 .",

    "very near zero but sizable values of @xmath90 and @xmath36 , @xmath45 is always in the first octant , i.e. lower than @xmath94 . on the other hand",
    ", a value of @xmath91 greater than 0.01 and in the range 0.01 - 0.15 takes to @xmath45 to the second octant , i.e. exceeding @xmath94 .",
    "thus the octant determination of @xmath45 will help pin down the value of @xmath91 . 0.1 in iii )",
    "the crucial role in generating a non zero @xmath1 is played by @xmath90 .",
    "the range of @xmath90 , that is needed to accommodate the observed @xmath1 , is @xmath95 .",
    "the lower bound can be tinkered with a bit by suitably large values of @xmath91 and @xmath36 , but it is a minor effect . 0.1 in 0.1 in",
    "let us now turn to phases and masses . while one needs to restrict @xmath96 to @xmath97 to fit the data , @xmath98 is found to be completely unrestricted .",
    "the allowed region of the @xmath99-@xmath100 parametric plane for the surviving texture is shown in the top left panel of fig.1 .",
    "the permitted ranges of these parameters are found to be @xmath101 , @xmath102 .",
    "we find @xmath74 to be constrained to be very close to @xmath103 : @xmath104 .",
    "this @xmath17 texture allows only an inverted ordering of the neutrino masses with @xmath105 .",
    "the allowed value of the sum @xmath106 has been plotted against @xmath49 in the topmost right panel of fig.1 and so have those of @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "we can say that @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 and moreover @xmath110 .",
    "thus a quasidegenerate neutrino mass spectrum with an inverted ordering is established .",
    "going down , we have successively plotted the allowed magnitude of the dirac phase @xmath80 vs that of the jarlskog invariant @xmath111 and the majorana phases @xmath112 vs @xmath113 .",
    "we see that @xmath114 and @xmath115 whereas @xmath116 and @xmath117 . 0.1 in coming to the three zero texture @xmath21 , we find in this case that there are four @xmath0 symmetry breaking real parameters @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath118 and @xmath36 as well as three phase angles @xmath96 , @xmath98 and @xmath119 .",
    "it is seen that with @xmath90 = @xmath91 = 0 and nonzero values of the other parameters , it is possible to accommodate the input experimental results .",
    "so , henceforth , we set @xmath120 .",
    "one may also choose to set @xmath92 ; however , in that case , the range of @xmath1 comes out as a rather narrow one : @xmath121 and @xmath122 , i.e , the latter lies in the first octant . a different solution is found with @xmath123 ( i.e. in the second octant ) for @xmath124 and @xmath125 , but the lower bounds on those parameters have to be increased to 0.03 and 0.07 respectively in order to accommodate the full @xmath46 range of @xmath1 .",
    "it may be noted that @xmath118 is the crucial parameter here for the generation of a nonzero @xmath1 . on the other hand ,",
    "the results are not sensitive to the upper bounds on @xmath36 and @xmath118 .",
    "finally , the effects of @xmath26 ( @xmath126 ) are marginal ; @xmath127 can swing from 0 to @xmath128 .",
    "this texture @xmath21 also has @xmath129 .",
