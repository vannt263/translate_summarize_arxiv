    "the daily variations of the geomagnetic field were discovered by the english researchers through the observation of a compass needle motions in 1722 . since then , it is well known that a typical spectrum of those magnetic variations is composed by a few harmonics of the 24-h period ( 12 , 8 and 6-h ) .",
    "they are described as `` quiet daily geomagnetic field variations '' - referred to as `` sq '' for `` solar quiet '' field @xcite .",
    "the traditional method of calculating the baseline for the quiet day variations is to use the five quietest days for each month for each magnetic observatory . in this work ,",
    "we propose a new approach to study quiet periods by eliminating the disturbed days using a multi - scale process .",
    "to accomplish this task , we study the harmonics of the solar diurnal variations using hourly data of the h component and explore it via a gapped wavelet technique based on the continuous wavelet transform ( described in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the gapped wavelet technique is suitable for analysis of data with gaps .",
    "originally continuous wavelet transforms ( cwt ) were applied in geophysics to analyze seismic signals in the pioneer works of and . nowadays , the use of the wavelet technique has exponentially grown in many different areas @xcite .",
    "a similar trend is noted in the application of the wavelet cross - correlation technique , which has been used by many researchers , see for instance and the pioneer work of .",
    "this work aims mainly to highlight and interpret the solar diurnal variations at a brazilian station compared to the observations at other twelve magnetic stations reasonably well distributed over the whole earth s surface . by applying gapped wavelet transforms to these signals",
    ", we were able to analyze both the frequency content of each signal and the time dependence of that content .",
    "after computing the wavelet transform , we performed wavelet cross - correlation analysis , which was useful to isolate the period of geomagnetic spectral components in each station and to correlate them as function of scale ( pseudo - period or central - period ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section  [ the physics of the solar magnetic variation ] is devoted to explaining the principal mechanisms and aspects of the solar magnetic variations .",
    "section  [ magnetic data ] , the analyzed period and data are presented . section  [ methodology ] describes , divided in subsections , the used methodology : section  [ continuous wavelet transform ] presents a brief description of continuous wavelet transforms , section  [ gapped wavelet analysis ] is devoted to introduce the gapped wavelet analysis , and section  [ wavelet cross - correlation analysis ] to establish the wavelet cross - correlations and to explain how they can be quantified .",
    "section  [ results and discussion ] , the results are discussed and , section [ summary ] brings the conclusions of this work .",
    "the paper also includes two appendixes which we present some cwt application and mathematical details concerning to this work .",
    "the major driving force for quiet day field changes seems to arise from the dynamo - current process in the ionospheric e region between 90 and 130 km @xcite .",
    "tidal winds move the ions across the earth s magnetic field producing electro - magnetic forces ( emfs ) .",
    "those emfs drive electric currents in the conducting e region which give rise to daily variations in the magnetic field measured at the ground level ( for details see * ? ? ?",
    ". through these mechanisms , two vortices of currents are induced , one in the northern hemisphere ( clockwise ) and another in the southern hemisphere ( counterclockwise ) . at the same time , a strong eastward electric jet is formed throughout the equatorial region .",
    "there are three factors that affect the dynamo process : the ionospheric wind , the ionospheric conductivity and the geomagnetic field configuration .",
    "the wind and the conductivity vary seasonally due to their dependence on the solar zenith angle @xcite . concluded that the correlation between the sq amplitude and solar zenith was higher in high latitude than in low latitude regions due to the effect of the prenoon - postnoon asymmetry of sq .",
    "the sq field variation has a main spatial dependence on latitude and is affected by other factors including epoch of the year and level of solar activity . observed two kinds of regular changes in the solar diurnal magnetic variations on quiet days : annual variation , that affects both the type and the amplitude during each year ; and solar activity variation , that affects fundamentally the amplitude along each sunspot cycle .",
    "estimated that the intensity of the sq currents in high solar activity was about twice larger than in low solar activity .",
    "many other researchers studied the variations of the sq , including that examined the annual , semi - annual and even the whole solar cycle .",
    "examined seasonal variations and longitudinal inequalities of the electrostatic - field in the ionosphere by looking at its electric conductivity and the earth s main magnetic field",
    ". showed solar activity dependence of the sq amplitude , and explained this effect through the ionospheric conductivity .",
    "also compared the amplitude of the sq for the same value of conductivity .",
    "the seasonal variation is seemingly due to differences in neutral winds or to the magnetic effect of the field - aligned current ( fac ) flowing between the two hemispheres generated by the asymmetry in the dynamo action .",
    "the facs are controlled by interplanetary magnetic fields ( imf ) and its electric fields can directly penetrate to the equatorial ionosphere @xcite .",
    "some evidence of the influence of oceanic tides on the magnetic daily variation has been obtained by .",
    "they found small semidiurnal variations of the z component at a coastal site ( cambria , california ) and at two island stations ( honolulu and san miguel ) that could not be explained by the atmospheric tidal theory .",
    "they suggested that these variations must be due predominantly to oceanic tides .",
    "it is important to mention here that the conductivity of the ocean does not vary significantly with time , unlike the ionospheric conductivity . as a consequence ,",
    "the seasonal variation of the oceanic contribution is expected to be smaller than the ionospheric contribution @xcite .",
    "magnetic stations on islands or coastlines are fully exposed to anomalous effects of the ocean @xcite .",
    "the oceans , as well as the ionosphere , constitute electrical conductors and they are subject to tidal motions . as a result of the tidal flow of the ocean water , we might expect the effects of some kind of dynamo @xcite . the electric current system induced by the oceanic tides due to the drifting motion produces daily variation on magnetic stations located at oceanic islands and nearby shores .",
    "caution must be taken when interpreting the solar magnetic variations at a particular station , if the purpose is to obtain a world - wide analysis of the sq field .",
    "the total variation measured on the ground consists both of external ( ionospheric current ) and internal ( induced earth current ) contributions @xcite . the pattern of the conductivity of surfaces layers of the earth will introduce a corresponding small scale pattern into the distribution of the induced currents . at some stations , an accurate indication of the average induced current system is difficult to determine , consequently its effects",
    "can not be fully distinguished @xcite .    in his review",
    ", suggested that the interpretation of field variations at a particular observatory must be done carefully .",
    "although the ionosphere current system may have a fairly simple world - wide pattern , the relatively small variation of the conductivity distribution of the earth s surface will introduce a corresponding small variation into the distribution of the induced currents .",
    "however , the external origin contribution of the sq field is about 2.5 times that of the internal origin @xcite .",
    "therefore , in this work , we have disregarded the influence of the internal contributions on the analysis of the diurnal geomagnetic variations .",
    "in this section , we first describe the data used to study the quiet day variations .",
    "we also discuss the considerations used in data treatment for the different magnetic stations .",
    "our primary interest is to correlate the response of the geomagnetic field at vassouras to the other twelve previously chosen magnetic stations .",
    "the vassouras magnetic observatory , is located in rio de janeiro , brazil , under the south atlantic magnetic anomaly ( sama ) influence .",
    "it has been active since 1915 and is a member of the intermagnet program .",
    "one of the peculiarities of vss is its location , at low latitude , where the h component is essentially the same as the total geomagnetic field . in forthcoming years",
    ", a brazilian network of magnetometers will be implemented and vss could be used as reference .    to fulfill our purpose , we use hourly mean value series of the h geomagnetic component .",
    "some magnetic stations have available the x component , then we convert the x component of xyz system to the h component of the hdz system of vector representation of the earth s magnetic field ( as described in * ? ? ?",
    "we use @xmath0 , where x is the vertical component in the xyz system , h is the horizontal magnitude and d is the angular direction of the horizontal component from the geographic north ( declination ) . in principle",
    ", this system conversion does not affect our results because we only use magnetic stations of low- and mid - latitudes and we are interested in the magnetic variations .",
    "the magnetic stations that use the xyz system are ams , asp , bel and clf .",
    "the conversion of systems was performed for bou , cmo , eyr , hon and sjg for the data between 1999 and 2003 and in bmt and kak for the data between 1999 and 2004 .    the distribution of the magnetic stations , with their iaga code ,",
    "is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : mapstations ] . the corresponding codes and locations are given in table  [ table : abbcode ] which the sequence is organized by the geographical latitude of the stations .",
    "this work relies on data collections provided by the intermagnet programme ( http://www.intermagnet.org ) .            in this section",
    ", an analysis of a synthetic signal is performed to illustrate the results and the interpretation of the cwt and the cwt using gapped wavelet techniques , with the purpose to highlight the differences and the advantages as mentioned earlier . in order to exemplify the wavelet scalogram expected from this analysis",
    ", we defined a synthetic sq to reproduce the daily magnetic variation , similarly to the described in ,                fig .",
    "[ fig:1a ] , from top to bottom , shows the synthetic geomagnetic signal and the wavelet square modulus ( scalogram ) with morlet wavelet .",
    "it was possible to identify the two most prevailing periods ( 12 and 24-h ) due to the quiet variations .",
    "also , we can identify the change of frequencies introduced by the noise , which indicates that the wavelet analysis is useful for these multi - scale phenomena . in fig .",
    "[ fig:1b ] , we used the same synthetic signal used in fig .",
    "[ fig:1a ] but modified with additional random gaps in the signal .",
    "the areas with gaps were signalized by arrows and dashed lines .",
    "we applied the gapped wavelet in this signal . in this new analysis , it was also possible to identify the quiet geomagnetic variations with periods of 12 and 24-h and there not a significantly difference in the common intervals of the cwt and gapped scalograms , figs .",
    "[ fig:1a ] and [ fig:1b ] , respectively .",
    "however , there was a little effect in the boundaries surrounding the gaps regions which led to some energy lost .",
    "this energy lost was not relevant , as seen in the comparison , see figs .",
    "[ fig:1a ] and [ fig:1b ] , and can be neglected .    in an attempt to fill the gaps",
    ", we first tried to use cubic splines interpolation , which led to an underestimation of high frequencies .",
    "as the signals may have many spectral components , only by using gapped wavelet , the high - frequency part of the spectrum can be reconstructed .",
    "for this reason , the gapped wavelet has some advantages over interpolation .",
    "however , the gapped wavelet has some limitations , it can only be used if the gap is not larger than the period of analysis .        after having applied the cwt and gapped wavelets in the synthetic signal , as presented in figs .",
    "[ fig:1a ] and [ fig:1b ] , the conclusion was that the gapped wavelet fulfilled better the purposes of this work ."
