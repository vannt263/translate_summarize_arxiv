    "similarly to the conventional electronic transistors , in atomtronics , a transistor is a nonlinear device where a small atom current or atom number controls a large current .",
    "the existing proposals for an atom transistor can be divided into open and closed architectures .",
    "the former @xcite is conceptually close to the conventional electronic devices ( the work @xcite also contains a design for a diode ) . the latter , in turn , can be separated into the schemes based on an adiabatic population transfer protocol @xcite ( along with the similar atom diode proposals @xcite ) , and the schemes where the ( large ) base current is induced by the difference in chemical potentials between the `` electrodes '' .",
    "the base current can be controlled by either the internal state of a localized impurity @xcite or by the number of ( strongly interacting ) atoms in the middle site @xcite .",
    "this latter scheme is nothing else but an atomic version of the _ field - effect transistor _ ( fet ) . here",
    ", the large atomic current from the `` source '' to the `` drain '' is controlled by a a small number of atoms in the `` gate . ''",
    "the interatomic repulsion in the gate is so strong that the chemical potential is large even when the number of atoms in the gate is small .    here",
    "we show that the off - on threshold in our transistor corresponds to the onset of ergodicity  the point where the system becomes able to visit the thermal values of the former integrals of motion in principle , albeit not being fully thermalized yet .",
    "the paradigmatic atom transistor is realized in a tight binding model for three coupled bosonic wells on a line , the `` source '' , the `` gate '' , and the `` drain '' @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system reads @xmath0 where the indices `` '' , `` '' , and `` '' stand for source , gate and drain , respectively ,",
    "@xmath1 and @xmath2 are the site - dependent one - body energy and the strength of the on - site two - body interactions for a site @xmath3 , and @xmath4 is the hopping constant between sites @xmath5 and @xmath6 .    in general ,",
    "the purpose of the atom fet transistor is to control the current of atoms from the source to the drain using small variations in the chemical potential of the gate , @xmath7 , controlled in turn by its population , @xmath8 . according to the original proposal @xcite , the transition of atoms between the source and the gate plays the role of a `` bottleneck , '' activated only when the source and gate chemical potentials become close ; in contrast",
    ", the gate - drain link is made insensitive to the gate - drain chemical potential difference , transmitting every atom that happens to appear at the gate .",
    "this can be achieved by providing a comparatively large on - site interaction strength for the gate , subsequently detuned from the energy of the source .",
    "one then chooses the hopping constants and the on - site energies in such a way that the source - gate transition exhibits a narrow resonance , and the gate - drain transition a broad one",
    ". we will be using the following representative set of parameters : @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , with the rest of the parameters set to zero : @xmath15 .",

    "is provided by the interactions between the atoms in the gate , @xmath20 ; this energy increases quadratically with @xmath20 , leading to the decreasing ( with energy ) energy spacings .",

    ", as the system approaches the resonant point @xmath45 , the ensemble average starts falling _ within the range _ of the temporal fluctuations ; not enough to be predominantly within the range , but enough for this effect to be detectable .",
    "in this work , we studied the atom fet transistor scheme suggested in ref .  @xcite using the tools of quantum non - equilibrium dynamics @xcite .",
    "we first justified the applicability of the semiclassical approximation applied to the standard measures of the non - equilibrium .",
    "we then focused , using a semiclalssical model ( equivalent to a mean - field one ) , on the initial conditions with zero drain occupation , and used the gate occupation as the knob that controls further dynamics . instead of the     and @xmath54 , out of the full available energy range of @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",

    "solid horizontal line reflects the average over _ all _ the realizations in the window , with no selection of the initial values of the drain occupation @xmath60 .",
    "note that only when the initial gate occupation approaches the resonant value of @xmath61 ( see fig . [ detune_chem ] ) , the mobility in the phase space becomes sufficient for the drain occupation to reach its thermal value ( solid line ) , at least at some instances of time .",
    "the system parameters are the same as in fig.[mean_nd_both](b),scaledwidth=40.0% ]    traditional source - to - drain current , as the transistor output we choose the infinite time average of the drain occupation : this change brings us closer to the conventional measures of non - equilibrium .",
    "we then studied how the drain occupation depends on the initial gate occupation . at zero gate occupation ( transistor `` off '' ) ,",
    "no atoms are transmitted to the source . to the contrary , at a point where the gate s chemical potential levels with that of the source ( transistor `` on '' ) , the drain becomes populated .",
    "one may expect that at this point , the transistor is fully thermalized , i.e. that the infinite time averages of the observables approach their ( microcanonical ) ensemble averages .",
    "however , it turned out that even at the resonant point , the drain occupation is still far below its thermal value .",
    "instead , we found that the `` on '' regime is characterized by the accessibly of the thermal values of the drain in `` principle '' .",
    "namely , around the `` on '' value of the initial gate occupation , the temporal fluctuations of the drain occupation become capable of `` touching '' the thermal values for some periods of time , without spending much time there .",
    "the overall conclusion is that the ergodicity is not a necessary condition for the operation of atom transistor ( while the conventional semiconductor devices do operate close to a thermal equilibrium ) : this conclusion may allow one to broaden the search for an optimal configuration of an atom transistor .",
