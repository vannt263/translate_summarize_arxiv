    "that length - scale is typically in the regime where the back - reaction time is shorter than the self - quenching time ( eq.[e : treact ] ) , and so @xmath276 a similar correspondence is seen between the variability timescale of the agn model ( section [ ss : jbh ] ) , @xmath277 , and the power - law break in its power spectrum ( figure [ f : mdot ] ) .",
    "thus , @xmath278 can be interpreted as the shortest timescale for which there is substantial variability power .",

    "the blue and red circles denote the projection of @xmath140 and @xmath279 , respectively , at the end of the simulation . ]",
    "the enhanced mass accretion rate translates directly to a faster rate of change in the magnitude of the the mbh spin , @xmath298 , as the mbh spin vector remains aligned with the inner regions of the disk due to the bp torques .",
    "the bp torques also couple the fluctuating rr torques on the disk to the mbh spin orientation ( figure [ f : jbh ] , [ e : djbhdt ] ) . for the effect to be significant",
    ", the disk must be massive enough to carry a substantial amount of angular momentum ( eqs .",
    "[ e : tbp ] , [ e : djbhdt ] ) , but not so massive as to remain effectively immobile against the rr torques .",
    "we find that the response of the mbh spin in ngc  4258 to the bp torques is very small , because of the very low mass of the disk .",
    "however , the effect can be larger in systems with a more massive accretion disk .",
    "figure ( [ f : jbh ] ) shows as an example the evolution of the mbh spin axis relative to its initial direction ( we omit the much smaller spin evolution due to accretion ) , and that of the total angular momentum of the disk , for a low - mass luminous agn model that corresponds to a seyfert galaxy ( @xmath299 for a radiative efficiency of @xmath280 ) . the angular momenta of the mbh and the disk both execute a random walk around their initial orientation .",
    "the amplitude of the disk angular momentum jitter is larger than that of the mbh spin , because the rr coherence time , @xmath300 yr at @xmath294 pc is much shorter than the bp timescale @xmath297 , and so the mbh spin can not `` catch up '' with the faster changes in the direction of the stellar torques .",
    "we find that for this specific model , the mbh spin scatters across @xmath301 over an @xmath154-folding time ( @xmath302 years ) .",
    "another consequence of the short coherence time ( compared to @xmath303 yr ) is that the rr - induced warps in this disk model have angles of only @xmath304 .",
    "their effect on the mass accretion rate is correspondingly small , only a @xmath305 increase over that in a flat disk .",
    "a circumnuclear accretion disk does not exist in isolation around a mbh .",
    "rather , it shares the volume with the high - density nuclear cluster that is predicted to form there while the nucleus evolves .",
    "the cluster is expected to be on average spatially isotropic near the mbh , but the poisson fluctuations in the distribution of orbital inclinations lead to a slowly varying residual force that exerts coherent torques on the disk ( rr ) .",
    "we argue ( section [ ss : oom ] ) that a thin keplerian disk is primarily torqued by these purely gravitational interactions with the stars , rather than by the hydrodynamical ones that occur when stars plunge through the disk .",
    "the rr torques warp the disk and can lead to order unity variability in the disk geometry ( figs .",
    "[ f : snaps ] , [ f : wmaser ] ) , its mass accretion rate ( figs .",
    "[ f : wmaser ] , [ f : mdot ] ) and covering factor ( figure [ f : cf ] ) .",
    "the strong coupling between the stellar potential fluctuations and the disk via rr is then further extended to the mbh spin via the frame - dragging bp effect , and this allows angular momentum to be transferred from the nuclear cluster to the mbh .",
    "the combined effects of the perpendicular rr and bp torques excite a jitter in the mbh spin direction ( figure [ f : jbh ] ) .",
    "in addition , the increased mass accretion rate due to the rr - induced warping , together with the disk / mbh spin alignment due to the bp effect , lead to an increased growth rate of the mbh spin magnitude . we conclude that gravitational interactions between the stars and the disk excite a substantial level of irreducible variability in the disk properties  stationary accretion in a circumnuclear disk is merely an idealization .",
    "the large - scale warping of the disk ( for ngc  4258 , this coincides with the maser region warp ) reflects the rr coherence timescale at the mass - weighted mean disk radius , @xmath306 yr ( @xmath307 yr for ngc  4258 ) .",
    "generally , the effect of rr on the disk and the mbh will be substantial when the disk is long - lived , @xmath308 .",
    "there is a large spread in the estimates of agn and qso lifespans in the luminous phase , @xmath309@xmath310 yr ( e.g. @xcite ) , with some recent analyses suggesting an even longer lifespan of @xmath311 yr @xcite . for long - lived disk systems , the cumulative effects of rr - torquing",
    "can be large .",
    "one implication of the factor @xmath312 increase in the mean mass accretion rate over that in a flat stationary disk ( section [ ss : mdot ] ) , is that an mbh fed by an rr - torqued disk , whose mass accretion rate is raised to the eddington limit by warping , will be @xmath313 $ ] more massive than one that is fed by an otherwise identical flat disk , which is accreting at only @xmath314 of the eddington limit .",
    "for example , rr - torquing can accelerate mbh growth over a time @xmath315 ( assuming @xmath280 ) by a factor of up to @xmath316 ( for @xmath317 ) .",
    "alternatively , if radiation pressure prevents the increased rr - induced mass flow from accreting on the mbh , the accumulating excess mass may trigger outflows , or disk fragmentation and star formation .",
    "another cumulative effect of rr - torquing of the disk is the displacement of the mbh spin from its initial orientation due to the bp - induced random jitter .",
    "it is interesting to note that the few degrees amplitude of the displacement is still consistent with the typical observed @xmath301 opening angle of agn radio jets on large scales @xcite , assuming the jet direction reflects the spin direction .",
    "a direct geometric consequence of rr - induced warping is the substantial time - averaged covering factor the disk acquires relative to the central continuum source .",
    "this allows the disk to intercept the central radiation and be heated and ionized by it . such x - ray irradiation may in fact be essential for raising the gas temperature to the range necessary for maser emission @xcite , for the production of the observed emission lines in agn disks in general @xcite , for driving winds and outflows from disks @xcite , or for explaining narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies and ultra - soft agn @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of the effects of the stars on the disk depend on the central concentration of the stellar cluster , and is therefore sensitive to the degree of mass segregation in the system and to the fraction of massive compact remnants in the population .",
    "the more centrally concentrated the stellar density profile , and the more massive the stars ( for rr , the relevant quantity is @xmath318 , @xcite ) , the larger are the effects on the disk .",
    "it is worth noting that strong mass segregation with a power - law cusp profiles of @xmath319 is expected to occur in nuclei with old stellar populations @xcite , where the inner parts of the cusp are dominated by stellar black holes of mass @xmath320 .",
    "it is thus plausible that a substantial fraction of galactic nuclei have conditions that are conducive to rr - torquing of an accretion disk .    in this study we presented numerical results for galactic nuclei with mbh masses in the range @xmath321 ( with a massive disk close to @xmath322 ) to @xmath323 ( with a low - mass , low - accretion rate disk ) . in order to scale the results to other systems ,",
    "it is necessary to specify the scaling of the disk properties with mbh mass .",
    "we defer this to future work , and present here only a simple preliminary analysis that suggests that the effects are generally more important in lower - mass mbhs . assuming that all agn disks extend up to some universal large multiple of @xmath324 ( e.g. @xmath325 for @xmath158-disks limited by gravitational instability , @xcite ) , and assuming they all have the same aspect ratio , then @xmath326 and @xmath327 , so that @xmath328 . the angular momentum in the disk",
    "therefore scales as @xmath329 .",
    "the @xmath330 relation indicates that the mbh radius of influence scales as @xmath331 ( assuming @xmath332 ) , so that the number of stars in the mbh cusp inside @xmath4 scales as @xmath333 .",
    "the residual angular momentum in the stars that are efficiently coupled to the disk then scales as @xmath334 , and it then follows that @xmath335 .",
    "the ratio of the disk and stellar angular momenta is a slowly rising function of @xmath1 for @xmath336 .",
    "this implies that , all other parameters being equal , it should become progressively more difficult for the stars to torque the disk as the mbh mass increases .",
    "in addition , as argued in section ( [ ss : oom ] ) , the larger @xmath1 , the more the disk responds to the rr torques as a rigid body , rather than by growing warps .",
    "the calculations and conclusions presented here are limited by various assumptions and approximations .",
    "they are listed here briefly .",
    "some of these issues will be addressed in future work .",
