    "when a gaussian laser beam heats the interface separating two superimposed optically absorbing liquids , the inhomogeneous heating induces a local variation of the interfacial tension which in turn generates tangential shear stresses and sets up hydrodynamic flows known as thermocapillary or marangoni flows @xcite .",
    "these laser - induced thermocapillary flows were studied theoretically , experimentally and numerically in various cases , with a particular emphasis to the free - surface configuration . in the eighties , loulergue et al .",
    "@xcite investigated theoretically the heating of a flat fluid interface by a spatial sine modulation of an infrared laser beam to produce an infrared image converter . at the same time , viznyuk et al .",
    "@xcite , investigated the free - surface deformation of thin layers by gaussian laser beams and applied their theoretical results to beam shaping using what they called optocapillarity . beyond optical applications , longtin et al .",
    "@xcite investigated time dependent behaviors of free - surfaces by numerical simulation and intended a comparison between predictions for laser pulse heating with experiments and scaling analyses , the goal being to get new insights in laser melting and welding @xcite .",
    "one can also cite the theoretical analysis of rivas @xcite who studied the effect of the viscous stress on the interface deformation and the numerical work of marchuk @xcite who investigated the effect of convection . + we know that the temperature variation of the surface tension is usually negative for classical liquids @xcite .",
    "therefore , fluids are almost always pushed toward coldest regions and the previous experiments showed that laser heating produces beam centered dimple at the interface .",
    "this led bezuglyi et al .",
    "@xcite to consider very thin layers and investigate the possibility to optically control film rupture and hole formation in order to understand new mechanisms for varnish dewetting , wetting @xcite and spreading @xcite of liquid drops and microfilms over solid substrates .",
    "however , contrary to usual expectations , misev @xcite experimentally observed a curvature inversion of the interface deformation , i.e. a concave to convex transition , when decreasing the thickness of the fluid layer .",
    "therefore , it appears that dimple formation does not represent a general rule when fluid confinement starts to play a role , as already supported by classical marangoni experiments in thin cells @xcite .",
    "this transition from concave to convex interface deformation has been studied recently @xcite but the generalization to two - liquid systems still deserves to be investigated .",
    "this is the goal of the present work .",
    "+ we theoretically investigate thermocapillary effects induced by a gaussian laser beam that locally heats the interface separating two liquid layers or the interfaces of a thin film bounded by two liquid layers . beyond the general description of flow patterns and interface deformations in many different situations ,",
    "our investigation also provides new insights for digital optofluidics applications @xcite,@xcite , where light - actuated droplets are naturally confined and often close together , squeezing by the way thin liquid layers .",
    "+ our study is structured as follows : the theoretical resolution of the flow and the interface deformation is detailed in section 2 .",
    "section 3 reports results and discussion on the dependence of the flow and the deformation to the viscosity and layer thicknesses ratios in two different configurations .",
    "we first consider an interface separating two different liquid layers and then generalize these results to the case of thin film separating two same liquid layers .",
    "indicated that the interfacial tension increases with temperature . in this configuration , we arbitrarily consider @xmath0 , a situation often encountered in microfluidics due to the presence of large amount of surfactant . ]",
    "let us consider two liquid layers separated by an interface initially flat , horizontal and at rest , crossed by a continuous gaussian laser beam propagating perpendicularly to the interface ( see figure [ sketch ] ) . if at least one of the layers absorbs light , the interface will be locally heated by the laser .",
    "physical properties of the liquids ( denoted @xmath1 for the bottom liquid and @xmath2 for the top one ) are their viscosities @xmath3 , @xmath4 and densities @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "the interfacial tension is denoted by @xmath7 .",
    "liquids are enclosed in a cylindrical cell of radius @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the radius of the temperature distribution due to laser heating .",
    "+ considering the axisymmetry , along the @xmath10 axis of the exciting beam , of the temperature distribution , cylindrical coordinates ( @xmath11 with origin @xmath12 located at the intersection of the beam axis with the initial flat interface are chosen for this study .",
    "a point @xmath13 is thus referenced by the space coordinates @xmath14 .",
    "two different configurations are investigated .",
    "the first one ( a ) considers two liquid layers separated by an interface , and the second one ( b ) generalizes the two - layer situation to a symmetric system composed of three liquid layers , liquid @xmath1 being bounded on top and bottom by liquid @xmath2 ( see figure [ sketch ] ) .",
    "+      the temperature distribution within the fluid layers due to the heating sources @xmath15 obeys the heat equation @xmath16 @xmath17 and @xmath18 being the velocity and the thermal diffusivity of fluid @xmath19 .",
    "+ assuming , without the loss of generality , that only fluid @xmath1 absorbs light , @xmath20 and @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are respectively the thermal conductivity and the optical absorption of fluid @xmath19 at the used optical wavelength .",
    "+ light intensity distribution is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the beam power and @xmath26 the radial extension of the laser beam , also called beam waist .",
    "@xmath26 is always smaller than @xmath9 due to the non locality and the strong dependence in boundary conditions of temperature distributions .",
    "+ the keypoint for producing thermocapillary flows is not the overheating itself but the amplitude of the temperature gradient .",
    "laser heating is thus very appealing because it is extremely easy to produced weak amplitude overheating with large gradients .",
    "thus we can confidently consider a weak optical absorption in fluid @xmath1 such as @xmath27 , and neglect the axial variation of light intensity and therefore @xmath28 the convective and unsteady terms of equation ( [ heat ] ) can be neglected when considering that the thermal pclet number is small ( @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is a characteristic velocity ) and a characteristic heating time @xmath31 small compared to the viscous characteristic time @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the kinematic viscosity of fluid @xmath19 .",
    "+ an example of experiment fitting these assumptions can be found in a recent publication @xcite .",
    "+ exact solutions of the heat equation using continuity of temperature and heat flux at the interface can be calculated @xcite .",
    "however for the sake of simplicity we will consider a gaussian distribution for @xmath34 which is a reasonable approximation of the exact temperature field .",
    "+      both fluids obey the mass conservation and stokes equations , and are coupled through stress balance in addition to the continuity of velocity at the interface described by its height @xmath35 and denoted @xmath36 . as flows are expected to be viscous , the boundary value problem can be expressed as + @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41 is the pressure in each fluid and @xmath42 is the stress tensor corrected with a gravity term .",
    "the unit vector normal to the interface directed from fluid 1 to fluid 2 is denoted by @xmath43 , @xmath44 is the arc length on the interface , and @xmath45 is the unit vector tangent to the interface such as @xmath46 is orthonormal .",
    "+ in equation ( [ stressjump ] ) , @xmath47 is the double mean curvature of the axisymmetric interface in cylindrical coordinates .",
    "@xmath48 is the tangential stress due to a spatial variation of the interfacial tension . when this variation is due to a radially inhomogeneous heating , it is usually called thermocapillary stress",
    ". + the variation of interfacial tension can be induced by the local heating and by the migration of surface active surfactants molecules at the interface . generally , when there is no surfactants , @xmath49 and interfacial tension is smaller at the hot spot but when the interface is charged with surfactants , the effective change of interfacial tension , involving coupling between temperature and concentration , can make interfacial tension larger at the hot spot . in the present investigation , we consider the effective change of interfacial tension @xmath50 due to both the heating and the solutal effect .",
    "more details on the change of behavior of interfacial tension with temperature , due to the presence of surfactants , can be found in the following references : @xcite , @xcite .",
    "+ the thermocapillary stress induces local flows on both sides of the interface which lead to its deformation .",
    "+ considering on the one hand small deformation amplitude of height @xmath35 ( i.e. @xmath51 ) , we can write the tangential stress condition as + @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the temperature distribution at the interface due to laser heating . on the other hand , assuming a gaussian axisymmetric temperature distribution such as @xmath54 this expression of @xmath53 allows us to solve the hydrodynamics problem using the fourier - bessel transform defined such as @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the fourier - bessel transform of @xmath35 , @xmath57 the reciprocal variable , and @xmath58 the 0-order bessel @xmath59 function .",
    "we deduce @xmath60 with @xmath61 as we have @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the 1-order bessel @xmath59 function , we finally find @xmath64 therefore , we find from equation ( [ tang ] ) that @xmath65 necessarily takes the form + @xmath66 moreover as the mass conservation condition ( equation ( [ mass ] ) ) can be written as + @xmath67 it yields @xmath68 and the following relation between axial and radial velocities + @xmath69 from equations ( [ urk ] ) , ( [ uzk ] ) and ( [ rel ] ) we can now calculate the velocity field due to localized laser heating .      as far as one considers small interface deformation amplitude ,",
    "the velocity field can be evaluated for the initially flat interface @xmath70 .",
    "+ the stokes equations ( equation ( [ stokes ] ) ) can be written as follows in each liquid layer @xmath71 + @xmath72 @xmath73 remembering the following properties of the bessel functions + @xmath74 @xmath75 we rewrite equations ( [ pr ] ) and ( [ pz ] ) as + @xmath76 @xmath77 eliminating the pressure and using equation ( [ rel ] ) , we finally get + @xmath78 this @xmath79 order linear equation of order @xmath80 defines the eigen modes of the axial velocity . + its general solution is of the form + @xmath81 using equation ( [ rel ] ) , the solution for the radial velocity is written + @xmath82 where @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 are constants to be determined from boundary conditions .",
