    "over the past decade it has become widely accepted that hierarchical mergers play an important role in galaxy evolution @xcite .",
    "most such mergers involve gas and the formation of stars since , even at the present epoch , the great majority of galaxies contain cold gas @xcite",
    ". thus , gas - rich , `` wet '' mergers are an integral part of galaxy formation and growth @xcite .",
    "many interesting processes occur during these mergers , leading to phenomena such as starbursts and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "whereas star and star - cluster formation during merger - induced starbursts are beginning to be better understood , the processes associated with the formation and growth of central black holes , and with their feedback on the surrounding gas , remain mysterious ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "yet , the existence of a strong correlation between black - hole mass and spheroid mass @xcite compels us to believe that , no matter what the details of gas - rich mergers and accretions , the physical processes dictating black - hole growth may be surprisingly uniform and well defined @xcite .",
    "some questions of interest are : what is the sequence of events leading up to the formation of a central starburst and agn ?",
    "when does gaseous outflow begin and when does it peak ? and what are the conditions under which quenching of further star formation may occur ? observational answers to these questions can be sought through statistical studies of large samples of relatively distant objects or through more detailed studies of individual nearby mergers and merger remnants , where the relevant processes can be observed in detail .",
    "the present paper takes the latter approach and addresses mainly the first two of the above questions .",
    "the galaxy ngc  34 was first pointed out to us as a likely merger remnant by dr .",
    "christopher mihos .",
    "it is a relatively nearby representative of the class of luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs)defined as having infrared luminosities ( from @xmath581300 ) in the range @xmath9 @xcite  and has , therefore , been studied extensively in the infrared .",
    "its logarithmic infrared luminosity of @xmath10 @xcite places it in the mid - range of this class.11.4 are often quoted for ngc  34 , but are usually based only on the 60  and 100  fluxes observed by _",
    "iras_. ] the galaxy has been noted for its exceptionally high central luminosity density in the @xmath11 passband @xcite and has recently attracted attention for its feature - rich ir spectrum . in the near ir ( 0.82.4 ) , relatively weak forbidden emission lines from [ ] , [ ] , and [ ] are present in addition to the usual permitted lines of , h@xmath12 , and @xcite , while in the mid - ir ( 520 ) the spectrum is dominated by strong emission lines from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) and a broad , deep silicate absorption trough centered at @xmath510  @xcite .",
    "in fact , based on the latter features buchanan et al .",
    "declare ngc  34 to be the archetype of a large group of ( mostly seyfert ) galaxies with very red nuclear continua suggestive of cool dust and strong pah emission lines .",
    "the exact nature and origin of ngc  34 s _ optical _ nuclear spectrum have long been controversial .",
    "the present tendency is to place ngc  34 in a transition category of objects with nuclear spectra between starburst - dominated and of type seyfert 2 (= sey 2 ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this transition category is occasionally called amb for `` ambiguous '' ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in the past , many observers have classified ngc  34 as a sey 2 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "yet , others have emphasized the apparent weakness of the [ o iii]@xmath135007 emission line relative to either h@xmath14 or h@xmath15 and have classified ngc  34 as a narrow - emission - line galaxy @xcite or starburst galaxy ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; near ir : @xcite ) .",
    "in one illustrative example of the ambivalence of spectral classifiers , @xcite describe ngc  34 as `` indeed a seyfert 2 galaxy '' based on their eso 3.6-m telescope ccd spectrum , yet display this spectrum under the non - seyfert category `` miscellaneous '' and label it with `` '' ( for starburst ) .",
    "modern studies of the possible compositeness of ngc  34 s nuclear spectrum have led to estimates for the relative contributions to the bolometric flux of the starburst and agn ranging between about 75%/25% @xcite and 90%/10% @xcite .",
    "what all modern studies involving infrared flux measurements agree on is that the central star formation rate ( sfr ) in ngc  34 is high , with estimates ranging from about 50  @xcite to 8090  @xcite .",
    "there is independent evidence for the likely presence of an agn in ngc  34 from the measured x - ray luminosity which , corrected for strong and uncertain absorption , is @xmath16 erg s@xmath7 ( @xcite ; 1-@xmath17 errors computed by dr .",
    "jane rigby , private commun . ) .",
    "this luminosity , measured from _ xmm - newton _ observations , is comparable to that of the classical seyfert 1.5 galaxy ngc  4151 and is too high to be explained in terms of a pure starburst and its associated x - ray binaries .",
    "thus , it seems to support the presence of a weak agn , even though there is no high - resolution observation by _",
    "chandra _ to directly confirm the presence of a dominant central x - ray point source .",
    "ngc  34 is definitely gas rich and can , therefore , sustain its strong central starburst and present mild agn activity for some time to come .",

    "the measured magnitudes and colors are used in   [ sec33 ] to derive global photometric parameters for ngc  34 .    to derive the mean surface brightness in @xmath0 and the mean color indices as functions of radius we performed photometry in many concentric apertures ( 41 apertures for the groundbased  images and 48 apertures for the _ hst",

    "figure  [ fig06 ] shows the mean radial profiles of @xmath0 surface brightness and  and  color (   [ sec22 ] ) in ngc  34 , plotted both vs the fourth root of radius , , and vs @xmath94 .",

    "[ fig06]a from a straight line are highly significant ( most error bars being smaller than the size of the data points ) .",
    "the main feature is an extended `` bump '' in the @xmath0 vs  profile , centered on @xmath95 ( @xmath96 kpc ) and showing up in the @xmath0 vs @xmath94 profile as a relatively sharp `` knee '' or break in the slope at @xmath97 .",
    "note that the bump and knee are seen clearly in both the groundbased and the _ hst _  data ( filled and open circles , respectively ) , whence they represent a real feature .    and second , the color - index profiles display minima in both  and near the radii of the bump and knee ( @xmath534 kpc ) , indicating that the extra light causing these features in the @xmath0 profile must be quite blue .",
    "comparisons with simple model light distributions that contain contributions from both an -law spheroid and an exponential disk show that similar bumps and knees trace relatively bright exponential disks .",
    "hence , the above two features in ngc  34 suggest the presence of a significant , blue exponential disk embedded in a redder spheroid .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and to see ( 1 ) how much such fits improve the mean residuals over fits with a pure  law and ( 2 ) how consistent the model parameters obtained independently from @xmath36 , @xmath0 , and @xmath33 are",
    ". using the iraf / stsdas task _",
    "nfit1d _ , we performed such `` sph+ed '' ( spheroid plus exponential disk ) model fits in both magnitude - vs - radius and linear - flux - vs - radius space , and with exponential disks with and without central hole . to obtain consistent color information we ignored the _ hst _  data in @xmath0 and fitted only the mean  surface - brightness profiles measured from las campanas data .",
    "figure  [ fig08 ] shows how these fits appear when the surface brightness in @xmath36 is plotted vs linear radius @xmath42 , vs , and vs @xmath94 .",
    "superposed on the observations ( data points ) , the solid lines mark the best sph+ed  fit ( red ) and its component spheroid ( green ) and disk ( blue ) for the case of an exponential disk without central hole .",
    "correspondingly , dotted lines mark the best fit for the case of an exponential disk with a central hole @xcite .",
    "as a comparison of the solid and dotted red lines shows , the sph+ed  model profiles without and with a central hole in the exponential disk fit the data nearly identically well over the fitting range ( large data points from @xmath100 to @xmath101 ) , though  not surprisingly  they diverge at @xmath102 .",
    "the model profiles represent the observed @xmath36 ( and also @xmath103 ) surface brightnesses remarkably well , with rms residuals of only 0.07 mag in @xmath36 , thus strongly supporting the hypothesis that the bump in the -profile and the knee in the @xmath94-profile are caused by the presence of an exponential disk .",

    "[ fig07 ] and [ fig08 ] suggest , allowing for the presence of an exponential disk in addition to the spheroid brings a dramatic improvement in the fits , reducing the rms residuals in the various passbands by factors of 24 . also , the two scale lengths of the sph+ed  model , the effective radius  of the spheroid and the scale length @xmath15 of the exponential disk , agree remarkably well among the three passbands , as does the `` hole radius ''  in the case of the exponential disk with a central hole.0.01 mag ) . ]",
    "thus , the model parameters obtained independently from @xmath36 , @xmath0 , and @xmath33 are reasonably consistent , which again supports the hypothesis that an approximately exponential disk is present in ngc  34 .",
    "what are the relative luminosity and colors of this model disk ?",
    "if we pick the best - fit sph+ed  model without a hole in the disk , the model disk contributes 51% , 43% , and 27% of the total @xmath36 , @xmath0 , and @xmath33 light , respectively , within @xmath104 kpc ( corresponding to about the @xmath105 isophote , see   [ sec33 ] ) .",
    "its absolute visual magnitude , corrected for galactic foreground ( but not internal ) extinction , is @xmath106 , and its colors are @xmath107 and @xmath108 . if , on the other hand , we pick the best - fit sph+ed  model _ with _ a hole in its disk , then the model disk contributes about 34% , 26% , and 18% of the total @xmath36 , @xmath0 , and @xmath33 light , respectively , and has an absolute luminosity @xmath109 and color indices @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "thus , in either case the exponential disk is very blue and contributes significantly to the total optical luminosity of ngc  34 .",
    "an alternative way to state this is that the present - day bulge - to - disk ratios of ngc  34 for the model without a central hole in its disk are ( b / d)@xmath112 = 0.94 , ( b / d)@xmath113 = 1.32 , and ( b / d)@xmath114 = 2.7 ( within @xmath104 kpc ) , while those for the model with a central hole are ( b / d)@xmath112 = 1.9 , ( b / d)@xmath113 = 2.8 , and ( b / d)@xmath114 = 4.6 .",
    "these bulge - to - disk ratios will , of course , change as the stellar populations of the bulge and blue disk age .",
    "the heliocentric systemic velocity , measured from six absorption lines in the spectrum of the nucleus (   [ sec34 ] ) , is @xmath115 km  s@xmath7 .",
    "this value agrees to within 1.1@xmath17 ( combined error ) with the modern optical measurement of @xmath116 km  s@xmath7  by @xcite and to within 0.7@xmath17 with that of @xmath117 km  s@xmath7  ( from the triplet ) by @xcite , but disagrees significantly with many older optical measurements ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and with the value of @xmath118 km  s@xmath7  until recently adopted in the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) .",
    "the likely reason for the disagreement with older optical measurements , which tend to yield 100150 km  s@xmath7  lower values , is that these measurements often included the strong nad lines , shown in   [ sec34 ] to yield a velocity about 620 km  s@xmath7  lower than the above systemic velocity due to the presence of a gaseous outflow .",
    "the significantly higher systemic velocity until recently given in ned , on the other hand , was based on the mean heliocentric velocity from compiled integrated  observations @xcite . in merging galaxies ,",
    "the  distribution is often strongly asymmetric ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the mean  velocity can be a poor measure of the galaxies or remnant s systemic velocity .",
    "hence , and despite the high intrinsic accuracy of  velocities , the new optical absorption - line velocity of the nucleus of ngc  34 , supported by that measured in the near - infrared from the triplet by @xcite , is probably more accurate .",
    "after correction to the barycenter of the local group via @xmath119 km  s@xmath7   @xcite , the systemic velocity of ngc  34 is @xmath120 km  s@xmath7 , leading to the adopted distance of 85.2 mpc for @xmath20 km  s@xmath7mpc@xmath7 (   [ sec1 ] ) .    to calculate the absolute magnitudes of ngc  34 in different passbands , we first need to measure total magnitudes , traditionally defined as integrated magnitudes within the @xmath121 mag arcsec@xmath39  isophote . from the isophotes shown in fig .",
    "[ fig04 ] , and ignoring their extensions along the tidal tails , we determined that the area within the above isophote corresponds to that of a circular aperture of radius @xmath122 ( 15.1 kpc ) , and we approximated the total magnitudes by interpolating the magnitudes measured in concentric apertures ( table  [ tab02 ] ) to this radius .",
    "the resulting total magnitudes , , and  are given in table  [ tab08 ] below .",
    "for comparison , table  [ tab08 ] also gives the total @xmath99 magnitude measured by @xcite and here corrected to the same aperture ( i.e. , @xmath5  = 26.5 isophote ) as the total optical magnitudes .",
    "based on these total apparent magnitudes and the adopted distance and foreground extinction (   [ sec1 ] ) , the absolute visual magnitude and foreground - reddening - corrected total color indices of ngc  34 are @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 , and @xmath126 , respectively .    from the multi - aperture photometry given in table  [ tab02 ] and the isophotes , we estimate that the extra light _ beyond _ the above @xmath122 aperture used for the total magnitudes is about 7% @xmath41 3% in @xmath0 and originates mostly in the two main tidal tails .          as described in   [ sec1 ] , the appearance of the nuclear spectrum of ngc  34 has variously been attributed to the presence of a seyfert  2 nucleus , a nuclear starburst , or a combination of both .    the new nuclear spectrum shown in fig .",
    "[ fig09 ] does not contribute toward settling this controversy , but does reveal that there are systematic velocity differences between the ionized gas and the stars , and that some of the cool gas  as traced by d absorption  is experiencing a strong outflow of the kind often observed in ir - luminous galaxies with star formation rates @xmath410  @xcite .",
    "after we discovered the strong blueshift of the na d doublet , we determined the systemic _ stellar _ velocity in two ways : by measuring individually five balmer lines between h@xmath127 and h10 plus the k line and computing the mean velocity , and by cross - correlating the blue part of the nuclear spectrum ( @xmath12838205050 ) , clipped of emission lines , with the template spectrum of the massive young cluster ngc  7252:w3 described in   [ sec353 ] below .",
    "the weighted average of the two methods yielded the adopted heliocentric systemic velocity of @xmath129 km  s@xmath7  (   [ sec33 ] ) .",

    "620 km  s@xmath7and a maximum velocity of about @xmath61050 km  s@xmath7 .",
    "this maximum velocity has been derived from the shifts between the blue edges of the nuclear gas outflow and of the ( mostly ) stellar cluster doublets ( _ arrows _ ) .",
    "[ fig10 ] ]    tracing the line - of - sight velocities of cool , neutral gas between us and the nucleus of ngc  34 , the d doublet appears both broad and blueshifted relative to the stars .",

    "the nuclear line profile is @xmath52.3@xmath37 as wide ( fwhm ) as the cluster line profiles , and the measured mean position indicates a mean outflow of @xmath131 km  s@xmath7  from the nucleus .",
    "the maximum outflow velocity of the cool gas , estimated from the shift between the blue edges of the nuclear and cluster line profiles at half minimum ( arrows in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] ) is about @xmath132 km  s@xmath7 .",
    "these mean and maximum outflow velocities indicate an outflow that is strong , even for a galaxy with a star formation rate of @xmath133  like ngc  34 (   [ sec43 ] ) .",
    "the spatial extent of this outflow needs to be established before the mass involved in the outflow can be calculated . in principle , spectra of the many young star clusters can be used to map the outflow . however , the spectra presently available for five clusters (    [ sec24 ] and [ sec353 ] ) have too low signal - to - noise ratios to lead to conclusive results . whereas the na d doublets in clusters 1 and 2 appear to be mostly of stellar origin , with perhaps a mildly blue - shifted extra component in cluster  2 ( fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] ) , the doublets of clusters 3 and 7 do seem to indicate major blue shifts relative to both the clusters and the galaxy , even though the spectra are very noisy .",
    "relative to the systemic velocity of ngc  34 , the blueshift of the na d doublet in cluster 3 ( @xmath52.3 kpc nnw of the nucleus ) appears to be about @xmath134 km  s@xmath7 , while for cluster 7 ( 1.1 kpc nne of nucleus ) it appears to be about @xmath135 km  s@xmath7 .",
    "clearly , new spectra for more clusters are needed to properly map the full outflow .",
    "note that the shapes of the [ ] @xmath135007 and h@xmath15+[]@xmath1286548,6583 emission lines seem to indicate velocity broadening as well , even though the latter three lines blend in part because of the limited , @xmath55.3   resolution of our observations . yet , much higher - resolution observations made by @xcite with a coud spectrograph confirm that the h@xmath15 + [ ] lines are significantly broadened ( fwhm = @xmath136 km  s@xmath7  for h@xmath15 and @xmath137 km  s@xmath7  for [ ] @xmath136583 ) and _ may _ have weak underlying broader components . clearly , the apertures used to extract the nuclear spectrum by both @xcite ( @xmath138 ) and ourselves ( @xmath139 ) cover nuclear areas large enough to comprise varied ionized - gas motions , and new observations with higher _ spatial _ resolution are needed to better isolate individual narrow- and broad - line components .",
    "finally , it seems worth pointing out that the optical nuclear spectrum appears not only strongly reddened , but also highly composite ( fig .",
    "[ fig09 ] ) .",
    "blueward of @xmath140   the spectrum is dominated by strong balmer absorption lines typical of a poststarburst population .",
    "a comparison of the region containing the k line and the balmer lines h8 , ( h+)h@xmath141 , and h@xmath142 with model spectra of simple stellar populations computed by @xcite suggests a poststarburst age of about 300400 myr .",
    "yet , longward of @xmath134500 the optical spectrum is increasingly dominated by -region - like emission lines , suggesting the presence of an _ ongoing _ , strongly extincted starburst .",
    "of course , the main evidence for such an obscured central starburst comes from the infrared ( see   [ sec1 ] ) .",
    "the combined evidence suggests , then , that the region of strong starburst activity has shrunk with time and is now restricted to a highly obscured central region of @xmath671 kpc radius ( see  profile of fig .

    "this surface density , expressed as a number per kpc@xmath145 , was determined in successive circular annuli of 1  kpc width centered on the nucleus and has not been corrected for background objects or completeness . given that even the faintest of the 117 clusters are relatively bright , @xmath146 ,",
    "the contribution from background objects over the total field of view ( @xmath147 ) is negligible , while any completeness correction will mainly affect  in the innermost 12 kpc , where the galaxy background is brightest . for comparison",
    "the figure also shows , with arbitrary vertical shifts , the surface - brightness distribution of the underlying galaxy in @xmath36 and @xmath0 .",
    "the main result is that over most of the range in radius covered , @xmath1488 kpc , the surface number density of clusters tracks the underlying galaxy light remarkably well .",
    "this is similar to the situation observed in other recent merger remnants ( e.g. , ngc  3921 : @xcite ; ngc  7252 : @xcite ) and seems to indicate that violent relaxation redistributed the general luminous matter of the two merging galaxies in roughly the same manner as it redistributed the giant molecular clouds and young clusters forming from them @xcite .",

    "the value of  and its small error favor the younger age so clearly that we simply computed a weighted mean logarithmic age from the individual ages obtained for , , and .",
    "this mean logarithmic age , based on an assumed solar metallicity , is given in the last column of table  [ tab07 ] and corresponds to a ( linear ) age of @xmath183 myr .    for cluster  2 ,",
    "the situation is more complicated .",
    "the  color also favors the younger of two possible ages , yet various metal - line indices seem to point strongly toward the older age . we illustrate this with two figures containing diagnostic diagrams .",

    "whereas cluster  1 appears to be young ( @xmath185300 myr ) no matter what its exact metallicity is , cluster  2 in these diagrams appears to be nearly 630 myr old ( @xmath186 ) and of slightly subsolar metallicity .",
    "a similarly high age for cluster  2 seems to be indicated by the observed strengths of three individual fe - line indices , two of which have already been used in combination with the mg  @xmath181  index above .",
    "figure  [ fig16 ] plots the predicted and observed lick indices , fe5015 , fe5270 , and fe5335 vs logarithmic cluster age .",
    "whereas at its younger age cluster  1 falls near or slightly below the solar - metallicity track on all three fe - index diagrams , cluster  2 falls well outside any evolutionary tracks in two of the three fe - index diagrams .",
    "however , when plotted at its older age ( as inferred from the balmer - line indices ) cluster  2 falls within about a factor of two of the solar - metallicity tracks in all three fe - index diagrams .",
    "hence , for this cluster the higher mean logarithmic age given in table  [ tab07 ] , corresponding to an age of @xmath187 myr , seems to be at least as likely as the lower age of @xmath188 myr favored by the  index .    in conclusion",

    "the present discussion addresses various issues concerning the structure of ngc  34 , the nature of its young massive clusters , and its gaseous outflow .",
    "it concludes with a description of the sequence of events that may have unfolded during the merger up to its present stage .",
    "ngc  34 exhibits several signatures that we have come to associate with mergers of gas - rich disks : two long main tidal tails , despite the galaxy s relatively isolated position (   [ sec31 ] ) ; a single main body with an apparently single nucleus ; plenty of  and molecular gas , @xmath189 (   [ sec1 ] and table  [ tab08 ] ) ; a starburst with a sfr of 5090  @xcite ; and , as an extra , a likely agn .",
    "in addition , ngc  34 also features a remarkably blue , exponential stellar disk (   [ sec32 ] ) with a scale length of about 1.6 kpc ( table  [ tab05 ] ) and extending out to a radius of at least 10 kpc ( fig .  [ fig08 ] ) .",
    "three questions of interest concerning the past merger are : ( 1 ) is this blue exponential disk a surviving disk , or is it a new disk that formed from gas pooled during or after the merger ?",

    "the two filled color dots indicate the locations of the best - fit model spheroid and disk without central hole , while the two open circles indicate those for the best - fit model spheroid and disk _ with _ a central hole .",
    "( the dot sizes correspond to about @xmath412-@xmath17 errors in the color indices . )",
    "note that regardless of the absence or presence of a central hole , the disk colors suggest a single - burst disk age of approximately 400 myr .",
    "[ fig17 ] ]    in trying to address the first question , we note that the prominence of the exponential disk diminishes strongly from @xmath36 to @xmath33 , and the disk is undetectable in the @xmath99 surface - brightness profile measured by rj04 (   [ sec32 ] ) .",
    "this suggests that the disk consists mainly of stars younger than @xmath51  gyr , since any significant older stellar component of the disk should show in the @xmath99 profile .",
    "the position of the disk in the  vs  two - color diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig17 ] supports this hypothesis and allows us to estimate the age of the stellar component that dominates the optical light of the disk .",
    "shown in this diagram are evolutionary tracks for single - burst stellar populations ( ssp ) of metallicities @xmath182=0 $ ] and @xmath60.4 computed by bc03 and the colors of the best - fit exponential disk ( _ blue filled and open circle _ ) and spheroid ( _ red circles _ ) .",
    "the filled circles mark the disk and spheroid colors for the best - fit model with a full exponential disk , while the open circles mark the corresponding colors for the best - fit model with a disk that has a central hole ( see   [ sec32 ] ) .",
    "the fact that in both cases the location of the disk in the two - color diagram falls close to the ssp tracks suggests that the disk light may , indeed , be dominated by a postburst population with perhaps a relatively narrow age spread .",
    "projecting the two disk locations perpendicularly onto the model evolutionary tracks yields single - burst disk ages of @xmath190 myr for @xmath182=0 $ ] and @xmath191 myr for @xmath182=-0.4 $ ] , respectively , where the estimated errors reflect uncertainties in metallicity and extinction , but not in the systematics of the model .",
    "how massive is this disk , if indeed it formed mainly over a relatively short period about 400 myr ago ? with a mass - to - light ratio of @xmath192 for an ssp of @xmath182=0 $ ] and the above age @xmath193 ( bc03 ) , the absolute magnitudes of the best - fit model disk translate into disk masses of @xmath194 for the full disk and @xmath195 for the disk with a central hole , respectively .",
    "these estimated disk masses represent only about 27% and 17% , respectively , of the total mass of cold gas still present in ngc  34 ( @xmath196 , see   [ sec1 ] ) .",
    "hence , this blue disk may well have formed from gas pooled in the late stages of the merger .",
    "this brief discussion is not meant to exclude the possibility that the stellar disk may , at a diminished rate , continue to grow even at the present time . upon visual inspection of the _",
    "image one can see a close correspondence between some of the young star clusters and their surrounding dust lanes and knotty luminous filaments .",
    "this correspondence suggests that , especially near the two major dust lanes that _ may _ connect the inner disk to the outer tails (   [ sec31 ] ) , stars and clusters may still be forming and , therefore , adding to the disk s stellar mass .    in trying to address the second question , concerning what the approximate mass ratio of the two input disk galaxies may have been ,",
    "we note that there are at least three clues .",
    "first , the blue exponential disk ",
    "being most likely newly formed rather than a surviving structure  suggests that the merger leading to ngc  34 must have been close to being a major merger ( here defined as @xmath197 ) , or else the dominant of the two old - star disks would have partially survived ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , a clearly minor merger with @xmath198 seems unlikely , and the lack of a moderately massive old disk places a lower limit of @xmath50.3 on the mass ratio of the two input galaxies .",
    "second , the fact that the n tail appears significantly brighter than the s tail argues against a major merger of two nearly equal - mass disks , making a mass ratio close to 1:1 seem unlikely . by exclusion , then , the likely mass ratio of the two input disks must have been somewhere in the range  @xmath199 .",
    "third , another morphological feature of ngc  34 also seems to argue for a mass ratio approximately in the above range . on high - contrast displays ( e.g. , figs .",
    "[ fig01]a and [ fig01]e ) ngc  34 appears unlike either of the two classical remnants of nearly equal - mass mergers , ngc  7252 @xcite and ngc  3921 @xcite .",
    "rather , ngc  34 appears to have grafted onto it a low - surface - brightness cloud of debris ( the nw cloud , see   [ sec31 ] ) , from which emerge at least one , and possible two , faint tail - like features .",
    "model simulations of unequal - mass disk mergers with gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggest that up to four tidal tails may form and coexist in direct @xmath200 mergers , with `` each [ tail ] originating from a different disk at a different passage '' ( * ? ? ?",
    "fig .  5 ) .",
    "this situation may , in fact , correspond to the present configuration in ngc  34 and would seem to support a recent merger of mass ratio @xmath51/3 .",
    "independent support for this conclusion comes from the global kinematics of the remnant . in a diagram plotting a measure of rotational support , @xmath201 , versus the isophotal - shape parameter @xmath202",
    ", ngc  34 clearly falls in the quadrant of rotationally supported , disky merger remnants ( * ? ? ?",
    "* esp .  figs .  4 and 5 ) .",
    "simulations of disk  disk mergers with gas by @xcite suggest that remnants of mergers with mass ratios of @xmath203 populate the region of the diagram containing ngc  34 , whereas remnants of 1:1 mergers do not .    finally , the third question of interest concerns the current stage of the disk  disk merger in ngc  34 .",
    "specifically , has the merger in this galaxy essentially run to completion ? given the observed strong nuclear outflow (   [ sec34 ] ) and general evidence that starburst - induced outflows may peak around the time when the two nuclei coalesce ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the presence or absence of a second nucleus should help us discern just how advanced the current stage of this merger is .",
    "despite a past claim for a second nucleus in ngc  34 @xcite , we have found no evidence for it and can put some strong limits on its maximum brightness in the @xmath99 band .",
    "early observations at 10  showed a very compact , slightly north  south elongated mid - ir source at the nucleus with a full width at half maximum of @xmath204 @xcite or @xmath205 pc at our adopted distance .",
    "a radio continuum map obtained at 8.44 ghz with the vla and a @xmath206 beam shows an essentially unresolved central source , with possibly a second , much weaker source about @xmath207 south ( fig .  1 in @xcite ) .",
    "this second source is not explicitly mentioned by condon et al .  and , being @xmath5300@xmath37 weaker than the primary source , can hardly be counted as evidence for a second nucleus .",
    "the only positive evidence for a second nucleus stems from mid - ir observations at 8.8  and 12.5  carried out with spectrocam-10 , a diffraction - limited mid - ir camera , at the palomar 5-m telescope @xcite .",
    "these observations suggested the presence of a second mid - ir source about @xmath207 south of the primary nucleus , with a claimed brightness ratio of @xmath50.6 at 8.8  and @xmath50.4 at 12.5  relative to the primary nucleus .",
    "deconvolutions seemed to enhance the secondary nucleus and its similarity with the possible secondary 8.44 ghz radio source ( see figs .  4 and 5 in @xcite ) , yet the data clearly had a low signal - to - noise ratio and the reality of the second source seems doubtful .    we have conducted a search of nicmos @xmath99-band images of ngc  34 available via the _ hst _  archive and have found no trace of any secondary nucleus @xmath5@xmath207 south of the primary one .",
    "specifically , measurements on the @xmath99-band exposure n49j21080 ( camera nic2 , filter f205w , exposure time 512 s , program go-7268 , pi : van der marel ) , which nicely shows many of the young massive star clusters , demonstrate that any secondary nucleus  if present  must be @xmath2087.0 mag fainter in @xmath99 than the primary nucleus is .",
    "thus , if really a second nucleus existed and was of an instrinsic luminosity comparable to that of the primary nucleus , it would have to suffer an additional extinction of @xmath209 mag , corresponding to an additional visual extinction of @xmath210 mag .",
    "although we can not exclude this possibility , we conclude that  at least at present  there is no good evidence for a second nucleus of any significance .",
    "the merger in ngc  34 likely has run past the stage of the two nuclei coalescing and is , therefore , essentially complete.1% of the total luminosity of ngc  34 in the @xmath33 band and has no visible nucleus .",
    "likely , it is either a tidal fragment of one of the two previous disk galaxies or else an interacting dwarf companion galaxy unrelated to the main recent merger event in ngc  34 . ]    in short , as best as we can tell ngc  34 appears to be the remnant of a gas - rich ( `` wet '' ) merger between two disk galaxies with a mass ratio likely in the range @xmath199",
    ". out of the pooled gas of the two input galaxies a new exponential disk of stars has formed , and perhaps continues forming . as judged by the absence of any detectable second nucleus , the merger must essentially have run to completion .",
    "another signature of a recent gas - rich merger in ngc  34 are the many luminous young star clusters (   [ sec35 ] ) . as a whole , these clusters resemble the young globular - cluster systems observed in other recent merger remnants , including ngc  3597 @xcite , ngc  3921 @xcite , and ngc  7252 @xcite .",
    "the system includes about 140 luminous clusters ( @xmath211 ) whose surface number density tracks the underlying galaxy light in @xmath0 remarkably well .",
    "the system s effective radius , @xmath2123.1 kpc (   [ sec352 ] ) , is typical for globular - cluster systems both young and old , while the clusters power - law lf , @xmath161 , is typical for young cluster systems ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "given the presence of a newly - formed , young stellar disk in ngc  34 (   [ sec41 ] ) , an interesting question is whether this cluster system displays disk or halo kinematics . from five clusters with measured velocities",
    ", there is tentative evidence that the kinematics is that of a halo population (   [ sec353 ] ) , but many more cluster velocities are needed to answer the question in a definitive manner .",
    "the age distribution of the luminous clusters of ngc  34 is of great interest in trying to understand the star formation history of this recent merger remnant . in the absence of measured color indices for most clusters ,",
    "our current information on ages stems mainly from the spectra available for five clusters .",
    "the strong balmer absorption lines in these spectra suggest that all five clusters have ages in the range of about 0.11.0 gyr and are , therefore , young .",
    "young ages for most clusters are also indicated by the fact that nearly 3/4 of the detected candidate clusters ( 87 out of 117 ) have absolute magnitudes in the range @xmath213 , while at most a few percent of _ old _ globular clusters are typically more luminous than @xmath155 .    at present",
    ", we can not determine whether  within the 0.11.0 gyr age interval  the young clusters of ngc  34 have a relatively wide or narrow age distribution .",
    "of all candidate clusters , only the two most luminous have individually determined ages . as described in ",
    "[ sec354 ] , there is a possibility that both of these clusters have ages of about 130190 myr , although it looks more likely that cluster 1 is about @xmath183 myr old and cluster 2 about @xmath187 myr old .",
    "the first possibility would suggest that cluster formation may have peaked sharply in the recent past , while the more likely second possibility suggests that cluster formation may have been drawn out over @xmath50.5 gyr or may have occurred in two or more bursts .",
    "additional photometry and spectroscopy are needed to shed light on this important issue .",
    "what are the likely masses of the young star clusters ?",
    "for the two most luminous clusters , we can estimate photometric masses from their absolute visual magnitudes and spectroscopic ages . for cluster 1 ,",
    "the photometric mass is @xmath214 when derived from bc03 models with a @xcite imf and @xmath215 when derived from @xcite models with a @xcite imf .",
    "hence , this cluster is about 34 times more massive than @xmath216cen , the most massive gc in the milky way [ @xmath217 , @xcite ] . for cluster 2 ,",
    "the corresponding photometric masses are about ( 2024)@xmath218 ( or 56 @xmath219 ) if the cluster is @xmath5640 myr old , and about ( 911)@xmath218 ( or 23 @xmath219 ) if it is only @xmath5160 myr old .",
    "hence , both clusters clearly are young _ massive _ clusters ( ymcs ) , often understood to be clusters of mass @xmath410@xmath220 . by association ,",
    "presumably most of the 87 candidate clusters more luminous than @xmath221 are ymcs as well .",
    "are the ymcs of ngc  34 gravitationally bound and , therefore , genuine young globular clusters ?    although we have not attempted to measure effective radii for these clusters from the one available archival _",
    "@xmath0 exposure , we have measured their apparent full widths at half maximum with the iraf task _ imexamine _ and have compared the values with widths similarly measured for the young globular clusters s1 and s2 in ngc  3921 @xcite , a merger remnant at nearly the same redshift distance as ngc  34 . in both cases , the measurements were made from @xmath0 exposures taken with the planetary camera ( pc ) of wfpc2 within eight months of each other .",
    "the apparent widths of the five ngc  34 clusters observed spectroscopically are a few percent smaller than the apparent widths of clusters s1 and s2 in ngc  3921 , which both have measured effective radii of @xmath222 pc @xcite .",
    "hence , the ymcs of ngc  34 very likely have effective radii of @xmath675 pc as well , radii that are typical for globular clusters .",
    "given these normal effective radii and the estimated ages of @xmath410@xmath178 yr , corresponding to at least 2550 internal crossing times ( @xmath2234 myr ) , all five ngc  34 clusters observed spectroscopically must be gravitationally bound and are , therefore , _ massive _",
    "( @xmath224 ) _ young globular clusters_.    these clusters are likely to be long - lived .",
    "most of the early mass loss due to supernovae and stellar evolution , which can disrupt very young clusters , occurs during the first @xmath5100 myr ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "since the five ngc  34 clusters are all older than 100 myr , yet of normal compactness , they have already survived their most disruption - prone period and are likely to survive for at least several gyr and perhaps a hubble time or longer ( e.g. , @xcite , esp .",

    "much lower net outflow velocities averaging about @xmath226 km  s@xmath7  are also observed in the ionized gas .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it appears that most galaxies with centrally concentrated star formation in excess of @xmath510  may drive some form of outflow , regardless of whether they contain an agn or not @xcite .     and",
    "[ fig06 ] ) .",
    "note the high mean velocity of ngc  34 s outflow , exceeding the mean outflow velocities of all but three of the 24 more intensely star - forming ulirgs .",
    "[ fig18 ] ]    what is perhaps surprising about the outflow of ngc  34 is its relatively high mean and maximum velocities .",

    "fig .  6 ) .",
    "these galaxies represent the highest surface - brightness objects in their luminosity class and are thought to outline the highest mean outflow velocities .",
    "the dashed line represents an upper - envelope fit made via a simple model of projection effects ( for details , see @xcite ) .",
    "the figure suggests , then , that the neutral - gas outflow of ngc  34 is exceptionally strong for the estimated sfr of @xmath227 .",
    "even when compared to outflows in ulirgs , this outflow has an unusually high mean velocity : whereas the sfrs of the 15 ulirgs with outflows detected by martin ( squares in fig .  [ fig18 ] ) , @xmath228 , are 210@xmath37 higher than the sfr of ngc  34 , the mean outflow velocities of these ulirgs lie in the range 60500 km  s@xmath7 , while the corresponding velocity measured for ngc  34 is  @xmath229 km  s@xmath7 .    despite this ongoing high - velocity outflow there is still plenty of cool gas left in ngc  34 ( @xmath189 , see   [ sec1 ] ) , and an additional significant amount of cool gas has already been converted into a young stellar disk (   [ sec41 ] ) . even with its infrared luminosity of @xmath230 ngc  34 is clearly not in the league of the most luminous infrared galaxies ( @xmath231 ) where agns may  according to an increasingly widely held view  scour remnants free of gas so efficiently as to rapidly suppress all star formation .",
    "specifically , the transition to this extreme regime may occur for very massive remnants with velocity dispersions of @xmath232 km  s@xmath7@xcite , while ngc  34 has only @xmath233 km  s@xmath7@xcite .",
    "hence , the galaxy s cool - gas mass , sfr , and depth of the potential well are all consistent with each other .",
    "perhaps the most interesting lesson contributed by ngc  34 is that the sequence of various events may matter .",
    "as we are about to discuss , the outflow of cool gas in this galaxy seems to be occurring toward the end of the main starburst and after the gas has settled into a major new disk .      with a strong outflow of cool gas under way in ngc  34 ,",

    "settling into a disk toward the end of the merger ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a new stellar disk formed perhaps as much as @xmath5400 myr ago (   [ sec41 ] ) . a similar age is inferred from the optical nuclear spectrum , which suggests a 300400 myr old poststarburst population surrounding the highly obscured nucleus proper .",
    "the lack of any detectable second nucleus suggests that the nuclei of the two participant galaxies of mass ratio @xmath199 have coalesced . yet",
    ", there still is a strong gaseous outflow .",
    "therefore , _ if _ this outflow is of relatively short duration ( say , @xmath6750 myr ) , then it is occurring _",
    "after _ most of the merger processes have run to completion .",
    "we now elaborate on some details of this sketchy scenario .",
    "first , although the present cluster photometry does not allow us to exclude that some massive clusters may still be forming , the fact that five of the most luminous clusters all appear spectroscopically older than @xmath5100 myr strongly suggests that the main cluster - formation epoch , and hence the peak of the galaxy - wide starburst , is over . if there were younger clusters of similar mass , they should  after all  be more luminous , yet they do not seem to be numerous among the brightest clusters .",
    "second , similar things can be said about the young stellar disk .",
    "although it may still be forming stars at a diminished rate , it looks surprisingly smooth and appears to be at a more advanced evolutionary stage than , e.g. , the intensely star - forming central disk ( `` mini - spiral '' ) of ngc  7252 @xcite .",
    "the sheer existence of this smooth young disk in ngc  34 and its classical exponential structure make it seem unlikely that a strong , gas - depleting outflow coexisted during the disk s main formation period a few 100 myr ago . hence , like cluster formation disk formation seems to have largely preceded the present - day strong gaseous outflow .",
    "finally , although the nuclei appear to have coalesced , there is no firm evidence as to exactly when this final phase of the merging process occurred .",
    "yet , the exceptionally high central @xmath11-band luminosity density measured in ngc  34 @xcite , supported by a strong trend toward redder central colors ( figs .  [ fig06 ] and [ fig07 ] ) , suggests that a highly obscured central starburst , likely paired with a weak agn (   [ sec1 ] ) , is still occurring .",
    "if so , the nuclei may either still be in the last throes of their coalescence ( @xmath18550 pc apart ) or may have coalesced just recently , creating the final , concentrated starburst ( and agn ) that drives the present outflow .",
    "this , then , seems to us the most likely explanation of the combined observations .",
    "one interesting speculation is that  dynamical friction being weaker and acting more slowly in unequal - mass mergers than in equal - mass mergers  the seemingly late phase of strong gaseous outflow observed in ngc  34 may be a relatively normal consequence of the 1/3  2/3 mass ratio between the two galaxies that merged .",
    "whatever the exact interpretation and assuming that gaseous outflows peak for relatively brief periods , the indications seem strong that at least in ngc  34 the current outflow follows the main , galaxy - wide starburst , follows disk rebuilding , and may either immediately follow or be concurrent with the coalescence of the two nuclei .",
    "we have described imaging , photometric , and spectroscopic observations of the merger remnant ngc  34 ( mrk 938 ) obtained with the baade and du pont telescopes at las campanas , as well as the photometric analysis of an archival 500 s exposure in @xmath0 obtained with the _ hst_/wfpc2 camera .",
    "ngc  34 has often been classified as a sey  2 , but its nuclear spectrum is presently thought to be dominated by a highly obscured starburst , with a likely weak agn contribution .",
    "the main results of our observations and analysis are as follows :    \\1 .",
    "ngc  34 is relatively luminous ( @xmath1 for @xmath20 ) and situated at a distance of 85.2 mpc ( @xmath234 km  s@xmath7 ) .",
    "the galaxy features a single , very red nucleus , a main spheroid containing a prominent blue central disk and much outer fine structure , and a pair of tidal tails of unequal length and surface brightness , suggestive of two former disk galaxies of unequal mass .",
    "these galaxies appear to have completed merging .",
    "the remnant now features a rich system of young massive clusters , the above - mentioned blue exponential disk , and a strong gaseous outflow , all signatures of a recent gas - rich merger accompanied by a strong starburst .",
    "ngc  34 s system of candidate young star clusters comprises about 140 objects more luminous than @xmath235 .",
    "their surface number density tracks the underlying galaxy light in @xmath0 closely , and their luminosity function is a power law typical of young cluster systems , @xmath161 . of the 117 directly detected candidate clusters , 87 have absolute magnitudes in the range @xmath2 . among the most luminous clusters ,",
    "five observed spectroscopically all feature strong balmer absorption lines indicative of ages of @xmath50.11.0 gyr .",
    "they have estimated photometric masses of @xmath236 ( for a chabrier or kroupa imf ) and are gravitationally bound young globulars .",
    "their systemic kinematics seems to be dominated by relatively large random motions rather than by disk rotation , but velocities of more and spatially better distributed clusters will be needed to check this tentative result . finally , the cluster system s effective radius , @xmath2123.1 kpc , is typical for globular - cluster systems both young and old .",
    "ngc  34 s prominent central disk turns out to be exponential and can be traced , via surface - brightness profile decomposition , out to at least 10 kpc radius .",
    "its smooth structure and blue colors , @xmath237 and @xmath238 , suggest that its optical light may be dominated by a poststarburst stellar population about 400 myr old .",
    "this disk contributes @xmath551% , 43% , and 27% of the total @xmath36 , @xmath0 , and @xmath33 light , respectively , if one assumes that it has no central hole , and about 2/3 of these values if one assumes that it does have a central hole . in either case , because of its youth this exponential disk contributes significantly to the total optical luminosity of ngc  34 even though its mass may be relatively modest ( 24@xmath239 if @xmath5400 myr old ) .",
    "\\4 . as discovered from the broad blueshifted d lines of",
    ", the center of ngc  34 drives a strong outflow of cool , neutral gas .",
    "the center - of - line velocity of this gas is @xmath225 km  s@xmath7 , while the maximum detected velocity reaches about @xmath132 km  s@xmath7 .",
    "these outflow velocities are unusually high for a galaxy with an infrared luminosity of @xmath230 and estimated sfr of @xmath240 .",
    "much lower net outflow velocities averaging about @xmath226 km  s@xmath7  are also observed in the ionized gas .",
    "we note that  since blueshifted na d lines are also seen in two of the cluster spectra",
    " future detailed mapping of the cool - gas outflow should be feasible via multi - object cluster spectroscopy .",
    "the available morphological and structural evidence suggests that ngc  34 is the likely remnant of two recently merged gas - rich disk galaxies that had an estimated mass ratio of @xmath8 .",
    "while the merger proceeded , a galaxy - wide starburst seems to have formed the young massive clusters beginning perhaps @xmath5600 myr ago and the young exponential disk beginning shortly thereafter . by now",
    ", the two merging galaxies nuclei appear to have coalesced , the starburst has shrunk to a highly obscured central region of @xmath671 kpc radius , and there is a strong gaseous outflow . the outflow s high velocity may indicate that the obscured central starburst , and perhaps also the agn activity , may be at or near their peak strengths .",
    "we close with an educated guess : given the presence of a young stellar disk and of @xmath5@xmath241  of cool gas that seems unlikely to be entirely blown away in the future (   [ sec43 ] ) , ngc  34 may  over the next few gyrs  turn into a bulge - dominated sa galaxy akin to , though less massive than , the sombrero ( ngc  4594 ) .",
