    "the interstellar dust in the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) has gained new importance with the discovery that its ultraviolet ( uv ) extinction is uniquely similar to extinction found in starburst galaxies ( @xcite ; gordon , calzetti , & witt 1997 ) .",
    "dust in the galaxy and the large magellanic cloud does not show starburst galaxy - like extinction .",
    "starburst galaxies are the only type of galaxy that has been detected from low to high ( @xmath1 ) redshifts ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these galaxies serve as an excellent probe of galaxy evolution through the study of their star formation and metal enrichment rates at different redshifts .",
    "the derivation of these rates for high redshift galaxies is sensitive to the adopted uv dust extinction ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "thus , understanding the physical processes responsible for producing the starburst - like dust seen in the smc is important to the modeling of starburst galaxies .    in addition , the study of the uv extinction curve in local group galaxies promises to help in determining the sizes , shapes , and materials which make up dust grains .",
    "ultraviolet extinction curves have been determined in the milky way , the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , the smc , and ( tentatively ) m31 .",
    "the extinction curves in these four galaxies paint a complex picture of the environmental dependence of dust properties . in the milky way ,",
    "cardelli , clayton , & mathis ( 1989 , hereafter @xcite ) found that the infrared to uv extinction curves can be described fairly well by a relationship which depends on only one parameter , @xmath2 which is a measure of the overall dust grain size .",
    "there are significant deviations from the @xcite relation in different galactic environments ( @xcite ) . in the lmc ,",
    "the uv extinction curves show a distinctly different behavior between the 30  dor region ( a mini - starburst [ @xcite ] ) and the rest of the lmc ( @xcite ; @xcite , 1986 ) .",
    "the 2175    bump is weaker and the far - uv rise is stronger in the 30  dor region than in the rest of the lmc which have strengths similar to the average galactic extinction curve . in the smc ,",
    "the average extinction curve is characterized by a roughly linear rise ( versus @xmath0 ) increasing toward shorter wavelengths without a 2175    bump ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . yet",
    ", there is one sightline which has an extinction curve with a significant 2175  bump ( @xcite ) . in m31 ,",
    "the extinction curve is consistent with that of the average galactic extinction within the associated uncertainties , although the 2175    bump may be weak ( @xcite ) .",
    "the complex behavior in these four galaxies implies that the physical properties of dust grains may be dependent on a multitude of environmental parameters .",
    "two of these are metallicity and star formation activity both of which may affect the overall composition and size distribution of dust grains ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "there have been a number of papers based in part or entirely on the derivation of smc uv extinction curves ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these studies used the pair method to derive extinction curves ( see  [ sec_calc ] ) .",
    "the extinction curves were derived by comparing a reddened smc star to an unreddened smc star or ( more commonly ) a group of unreddened smc stars .",
    "using unreddened stars of the same temperature and luminosity as the reddened stars is crucial to determining accurate extinction curves .",
    "all of the previous work suffered from poor spectral matching between reddened and unreddened stars due in part to the paucity of accurate optical and/or uv 2d spectral types .",
    "recent work has provided 2d spectral types in both the optical ( garmany , conti , & massey 1987 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and uv ( @xcite ) .",
    "the previous studies also suffered from low signal - to - noise spectra due to the faintness of the stars in the smc .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio and absolute calibration of all the spectra taken by the international ultraviolet explorer ( _ iue _ ) have been greatly improved through the newsips reduction routines ( @xcite ) .",
    "also , there is now a larger sample of smc stars observed with _",
    "iue _ than were available a decade or more ago when the previous studies were done .",
    "thus , the uv extinction curves in the smc can be greatly improved using star pairs that are better spectral matches and have higher s / n spectra .",
    "we list the reddened stars used in previous works in table  [ table_prev_work ] along with comments on the quality of the derived extinction curves .",

    "the h@xmath89 fluxes from the regions along the lines - of - sight toward azv  18 , 398 , & 456 are are 1 , 1 , and 0.1% , respectively , of that seen for 30  dor ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the dust along the azv  456 sightline has likely been exposed to a less harsh environment than the other three sightlines .",
    "it is known that processing of galactic dust near regions of active star formation results in changes in the uv extinction curve ( @xcite ) .",
    "a similar behavior is seen in the 30 dor region in the lmc ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is clear from this work that the harsh radiation and shock environment associated with star formation regions is modifying the dust in the smc . in all three galaxies ,",
    "star formation modifies nearby dust by altering the 2175    bump and increasing the strength of the far - uv extinction . yet",
    ", the extent of the modification does _ not _ seem to be well correlated with the level of star formation activity .",
    "figure  [ fig_all_ext ] plots the average extinction curves for the lmc ( 30  dor and rest of lmc , [ @xcite ] ) , the smc ( bar and wing ) , and the milky way ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "the extinction curve for @xmath91  ori  d , a star in the orion region , is also plotted .",
    "the average extinction curve for the smc bar is similar to the previous smc average extinction curve ( @xcite ) . from this figure , it is obvious that the extinction in the smc bar is unlike that which has been found anywhere except starburst galaxies ( @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the extinction in the smc wing is similar to that found in the lmc ( excluding the 30  dor region ) and the milky way open cluster trumpler  37 ( not shown , @xcite ; @xcite ) . the large difference between the extinction curve in the orion region and the smc bar implies that an orion - like region is not enough to produce starburst - like dust .",
    "something more is needed .",
    "this raises the question : why are the extinction properties of the dust in the smc bar so much more extreme than that found in the 30  dor region of the lmc ?",
    "the largest star formation region in the smc ( ngc  346 ) has only 10% the activity of 30  dor as measured by h@xmath89 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the extinction curve for azv  456 shows that dust , very similar to galactic and lmc dust , exists in the smc .",
    "therefore , there must be some significant environmental difference between the lmc 30  dor and smc bar regions which affects the extent to which star formation activity can modify dust .",
    "one known difference between the lmc and smc is metallicity .",
    "the metallicities of the lmc and smc are 0.2 and 0.6 dex lower , respectively , than the that of the local galactic ism ( the ism is 0.1 dex lower than solar ) .",
    "however , the relative abundances of the elements in the lmc and smc are similar to that found in the local interstellar medium ( @xcite ) .",
    "metallicity is correlated with the dust - to - gas ratio in galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "so , the amount of dust in the smc is significantly lower than that found in the lmc .",
    "this could affect the ability of dust grains in the smc to shield themselves from the radiation and shocks present near star formation regions .",
    "this contrasts with the finding that starburst galaxies all possess dust with an extinction curve like that found in the smc bar even though they have metallicities between 0.1 and 2.0 solar ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is possible that the much higher level of star formation present in starburst galaxies ( 10@xmath92 that of 30  dor ) overwhelms other environmental factors and always produces smc bar - like dust .",
    "the starburst galaxies were uv selected biasing the sample toward intrinsically bright , nearby starbursts with at least one lightly reddened starburst region . thus , the combination of a small column of dust and the more intense star formation possibly accounts for the presence of smc - like dust in all starburst galaxies studied in gordon et al .  ( 1997 )",
    "@xmath93 we have greatly improved the uv extinction curves for the smc through improvements in the s / n of the iue spectra and careful choices of reddened and comparison star pairs .",
    "@xmath93 four reddened smc stars possess the fitzpatrick criteria needed for accurate extinction calculations .",
    "three of the four stars possess a roughly linear ( with @xmath0 ) extinction curve . the lines - of - sight toward these three stars ( azv  18 , 214 , & 398 ) pass through active star formation regions .",
    "the fourth star ( azv  456 ) has an extinction curve with a 2175    bump and a weaker far - uv rise .",
    "its sightline also passes through a star formation region , but one which is much less active .",
    "@xmath93 processing of dust near regions of star formation results in variations in uv extinction . however , there is no simple correlation between the strength of the variations and the amount of star formation activity .",
    "other parameters such as galaxy metallicity must also play an important role .",
    "@xmath93 as this work is based on only four sightlines , more observations of reddened stars in the smc are needed for to confirm these results . of special need are observations outside the smc bar to confirm the extinction curve of azv  456 .",
