    "observable effects due to the change in the boundary conditions of quantum fields , like the creation of particles in an expanding universe @xcite or the casimir force @xcite , provide crucial information on quantum vacuum at the macroscopic level .",
    "after the recent results on casimir forces , with measurements performed in a variety of geometries ranging from the original parallel plane @xcite to the sphere - plane @xcite and crossed - cylinders @xcite , there is interest to understand dissipative effects of vacuum fluctuations , especially its interplay with relativity @xcite .",
    "this dissipation mechanism should induce irradiation of photons , a phenomenon also known as dynamical casimir effect @xcite .",
    "this can be understood both as the creation of particles under non - adiabatic changes in the boundary conditions of quantum fields , or as classical parametric amplification with the zero point energy of a vacuum field mode as input state . in this paper , following on the proposal described in @xcite , we describe a model for the superradiant amplification scheme with particular emphasis on its dynamics and the optimization of the involved parameters .",
    "as discussed in more detail in @xcite , under parametric amplification in an electromagnetic cavity an initial state of @xmath0 photons with frequency within the resonance bandwidth of the fundamental mode of the cavity @xmath1 is transformed into a squeezed state with an average number of photons growing in time as @xcite : @xmath2 provided that the parametric resonance condition with a mechanical driving at a frequency @xmath3 is fulfilled .",
    "the term @xmath4 in the hyperbolic sine function represents the squeezing parameter , with the modulation depth @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the velocity of the resonator and @xmath7 the speed of light .",
    "this exponential growth is eventually limited by the photon leakage of the cavity expressed through its quality factor @xmath8 , which saturates at the hold time @xmath9 , reaching a maximum photon population : @xmath10 given an initial number of photons in the cavity , which will be attributable to the quantum vacuum at temperatures such that @xmath11 ( see also @xcite for a detailed discussion ) , the average number of photons at saturation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sat ] ) strongly depends on the product of two parameters , @xmath8 and @xmath12 , which can be on the order of @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively .",
    "the expected saturated power initiated by casimir emission is : @xmath15 and for a 3.0 ghz fbar resonator and @xmath16 , the saturated power is @xmath17 w , which is too low to be detectable using current technology .",
    "this demands the use of an efficient , nearly quantum - limited , photon detector in the radio - frequency range .",
    "ultra - sensitive atomic detection schemes can be exploited for detecting casimir photons by preparing an ensemble of population - inverted atoms in a particular hyperfine state , which for alkali atoms ranges from 0.2 ghz for li to 9 ghz for cs , whose transition frequency corresponds to the cavity resonance .",
    "an additional amplification process is available in which the weak casimir signal triggers the stimulated emission of the ensemble of atoms .",
    "this effect is a form of superradiance @xcite .",
    "the hyperfine transition in the ground state occurs through a magnetic dipole interaction , and its natural lifetime in free space is approximately : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the bohr magneton and @xmath20 the magnetic permeability in vacuum .",
    "this natural lifetime in free space is favorably reduced inside a resonant cavity due to the modification of density of states @xcite : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the cavity mode volume . for a few ghz cavity with 1  @xmath23 cross - sectional area and @xmath24",
    ", the natural lifetime is reduced by a factor of @xmath25 . in spite of this cavity - enhanced spontaneous rate , the typical hyperfine transition lifetime for the alkali atoms is still impractically long , on the order of @xmath26  s. to shorten this timescale , let us suppose to inject @xmath27 excited atoms into the cavity .",
    "the casimir field acts on all atoms , stimulating emission on a time scale of the superradiant lifetime , defined as @xmath28 , which is in the millisecond range for @xmath29 or less .",
    "an atomic density large enough will then induce a superradiant burst with peak power of @xmath30 , increasing quadratically with the number of atoms .",
    "considering a few ghz resonator with @xmath13 atoms and @xmath31 s , yields @xmath32  w , a billionfold improvement over the power without superradiant amplification as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : phpower ] ) .    spontaneous emission into the cavity mode by the atoms will also trigger a superradiant burst , a process also known as superfluorescence . to distinguish this source of background from the casimir stimulated superradiance signal",
    ", one may study the temporal intensity envelope of the amplified photons .",
    "both the average delay ( @xmath33 ) of the peak intensity from the initial excitation of the atomic population and its fluctuation ( @xmath34 ) are reduced with increasing number of resonant photons @xmath35 initially present @xcite : @xmath36 it should be noted that these standard results follow when the cavity lifetime is much shorter than the superradiant lifetime .",
    "for very high @xmath8 , the system of coupled equations of motion must be integrated directly .",
    "tailoring the atomic number can further distinguish the casimir stimulated superradiance from superfluorescent pulses . in order for the superradiant pulse to develop fully",
    ", the growth rate must exceed any decay process , which is primarily due to doppler dephasing in the atomic cloud , and the atoms must remain in the interaction region for a time longer than the delay time .",
    "a proper choice of @xmath37 may suppress superfluorescence relative to casimir superradiance provided that the atoms will be removed from the cavity after the expected casimir delay time but prior to the superfluorescence delay ( @xmath38 in eq .",

    "are the regions in which direct detection is possible with state - of - art radiofrequency detectors , the region where superradiant amplification extends the range of detection , and the region experimentally inacessible also to superradiant amplification , with its lower limit due to the speed of micro - bolometers and heterodyne receivers of the current generation .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to the benchmark values of @xmath8 and @xmath12 satisfying @xmath39 which are at the edge of current technology of superconducting cavities and nanotechnology . ]    [ fig1 ]    the superradiant emission can be detected by coupling a power or field detector to the cavity , with response time small enough to resolve one superradiant lifetime .",
    "one issue with this direct measurement is the possible reduction of the quality factor of the cavity especially for large coupling efficiency .",
    "micro - bolometers mounted on etched `` spider - webs '' have an ultimate sensitivity of @xmath40 in the ghz range @xcite .",
    "spectrum analyzers are sensitive to sub - fw rf power of khz bandwidth @xcite , and the temporal profile of the burst can be reconstructed through vector analysis .",
    "to validate these qualitative estimates , it is necessary to simulate the dynamics of an atomic beam travelling through a low dissipation cavity .",
    "we shall discuss here specifically na atoms initially optically pumped into the @xmath41 ground state , though the approach is general .",

    "the atomic hamiltonian then can be represented by an @xmath54 matrix and the heisenberg equations of motion derived with some effort . to simplify the discussion ,",
    "let us assume a cylindrically symmetric cavity with field propagation ( @xmath55 ) primarily along the cavity axis ( @xmath56 ) , with quantization axis along the cavity axis , so that the active modes will be circularly polarized .",
    "if we also assume the ideal case where the na atoms are prepared in the @xmath57 state , then only the @xmath58 transition will be active and the hamiltonian can be reduced to : @xmath59 using the standard notation for polarization , @xmath60 and likewise for @xmath61 and @xmath62 with @xmath63 .",
    "the hyperfine transition resonance frequency @xmath64 can be tuned with an applied dc magnetic field along the quantization axis .",

    "the heisenberg equations of motion resolve to : @xmath68 note that total energy , excitation number are conserved in a lossless system as well as the bloch vector length .",
    "optical losses from the cavity can be included by adding a negative imaginary loss rate , @xmath69 , to the mode frequency .",
    "these equations suggest the operators can be factored as @xmath70 and @xmath71 , isolating the variable envelopes which are easier to integrate numerically . furthermore , if the cavity lifetime is much shorter than the superradiant lifetime ( @xmath72 ) , then it is convenient to first integrate eq .",

    "essentially , each atom responds to the emission from all atoms accumulated over one cavity lifetime .",
    "this result can then be inserted into eqs .",

    "the terms linear in @xmath79 represent the negligible action by the initial field . the quadratic terms involve feedback from all other atoms that generates superradiance .",
    "note that on resonance ( @xmath80 ) we arrive at the expected time scale , for @xmath81 , through the coefficient : @xmath82    for significant amplification , the number of interacting atoms must be large and it becomes prohibitively difficult to solve the @xmath83 coupled equations of motion .",
    "instead one can dice the atomic distribution in phase space into finite close - packed cells so that the number of cells is computationally feasible and the pertinent distribution and field profile features are retained .",
    "these constraints typically imply that the number of atoms per cell is at least ten . in this case , the correlation between the atomic population and photon number is inconsequential ( i.e. atom stimulation rate is not significantly limited by the stored energy ) and the expectation value of the operator products can be factored as @xmath84 .",
    "the sum over atoms can then be replaced with the multiple sum over cell indices : @xmath85 provided the atom position and velocity are replaced with the mean cell position @xmath86 and velocity @xmath87 and the atom operators now represent the typical atom in the cell .",
