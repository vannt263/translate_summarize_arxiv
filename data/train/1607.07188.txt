    "in his 1973 paper on the structure of p - points @xcite , blass posed the following question :    [ q : blass ] what ordinals can be embedded into the class of p - points when equipped with the ordering of rudin - keisler reducibility assuming martin s axiom ?    recall that an ultrafilter @xmath4 on @xmath5 is called a _",
    "p - point _ if for any @xmath6 there is @xmath7 such that @xmath8 , for every @xmath9 .",
    "all filters @xmath10 occurring in this paper are assumed to be _ proper _  meaning that @xmath11  and _ non - principal _  meaning that @xmath10 extends the filter of co - finite sets .",
    "it is not hard to see that an ultrafilter @xmath10 is a p - point if and only if every @xmath12 becomes either constant or finite - to - one on a set in @xmath10 .",
    "recall also the well - known rudin - keisler ordering on p - points .",
    "[ def : rk ] let @xmath10 and @xmath13 be ultrafilters on @xmath5 .",
    "we say that @xmath14 , i.e. @xmath10 is _ rudin - keisler ( rk ) reducible _ to @xmath13 or @xmath10 is _ rudin - keisler ( rk ) below _ @xmath13 , if there is @xmath15 such that @xmath16 for every @xmath17 . we say that @xmath18 , i.e. @xmath10 is _ rk equivalent _ to @xmath13 , if @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "it is worth noting here that the class of p - points is downwards closed with respect to this order . in other words , if @xmath10 is a p - point , then every ultrafilter that is rk below @xmath10 is also a p - point .",
    "it should also be noted that the existence of p - points can not be proved in @xmath21 by a celebrated result of shelah ( see @xcite ) .",
    "hence it is natural to assume some principle that guarantees the existence of `` many '' p - points when studying their properties under the rk or other similar orderings .",
    "common examples of such principles include the continuum hypothesis ( @xmath22 ) , martin s axiom ( @xmath23 ) , and martin s axiom for @xmath24-centered posets ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "blass showed in @xcite that the ordinal @xmath26 can be embedded into the p - points with respect to the rk ordering , if @xmath25 holds .",
    "in particular under @xmath22 , the ordinal @xmath27 embeds into the p - points with respect to rk reducibility .",
    "note that no ultrafilter @xmath13 can have more than @xmath28 predecessors in the rk order .",
    "this is because for each @xmath12 , there can be at most one ultrafilter @xmath10 for which @xmath29 witnesses the relation @xmath19 .",
    "therefore there can be no rk - chain of p - points of length @xmath30 .",
    "thus the strongest possible positive answer to question [ q : blass ] is that the ordinal @xmath3 embeds into the p - points under the rk ordering .",
    "though there have not been many advances directly pertaining to question [ q : blass ] after @xcite , several results have dealt with closely related issues .",
    "rosen  @xcite showed assuming @xmath22 that the ordinal @xmath26 occurs as an rk initial segment of the p - points .",
    "in other words , he produced a strictly increasing rk chain of p - points of length @xmath26 that is downwards closed under the relation @xmath31 up to rk equivalence .",
    "laflamme  @xcite further investigated well - ordered initial segments of the p - points under the rk ordering . for each countable ordinal @xmath32 , he produced a forcing notion @xmath33 that generically adds an rk initial segment of the p - points of order type @xmath32 .",
    "he also gave combinatorial characterizations of the generics added by these forcing notions .",
    "dobrinen and todorcevic  @xcite considered the tukey ordering on p - points .",
    "recall that for any @xmath34 , a map @xmath35 is said to be _ monotone _ if for every @xmath36 , @xmath37 implies @xmath38 , while @xmath39 is said to be _ cofinal _ in @xmath40 if for every @xmath41 there is @xmath42 so that @xmath43 .",
    "[ d2 ] we say that @xmath44 , i.e. @xmath10 is _ tukey reducible _ to @xmath13 or @xmath10 is _ tukey below _",
    "@xmath13 , if there is a monotone @xmath45 which is cofinal in @xmath10 .",
    "we say that @xmath46 , i.e. @xmath10 is _ tukey equivalent _ to @xmath13 , if @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "it is not hard to see that @xmath19 implies @xmath49 , and it was proved by raghavan and todorcevic in @xcite that @xmath22 implies the existence of p - points @xmath10 and @xmath13 such that @xmath50 , but @xmath51 .",
    "their result showed that the orders @xmath52 and @xmath31 can diverge in a strong sense even within the realm of p - points , although by another result from @xcite , the two orders coincide within the realm of selective ultrafilters . in @xcite ,",
    "dobrinen and todorcevic showed that every p - point has only @xmath28 tukey predecessors by establishing the following useful fact .",
    "[ thm : dt ] if @xmath13 is a p - point and @xmath10 is any ultrafilter with @xmath49 , then there is a continuous monotone @xmath53 such that @xmath54 is a monotone map that is cofinal in @xmath10 .",
    "they used this in @xcite to embed the ordinal @xmath26 into the class of p - points equipped with the ordering of tukey reducibility assuming @xmath25 .",
    "question 54 of @xcite asks whether there is a strictly increasing tukey chain of p - points of length @xmath3 . in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "dobrinen and todorcevic proved some analogues of laflamme s results mentioned above for the tukey order .",
    "in particular , they showed that each countable ordinal occurs as a tukey initial segment of the class of p - points , assuming @xmath25 .",
    "raghavan and shelah proved in @xcite that @xmath25 implies that the boolean algebra @xmath55 equipped with its natural ordering embeds into the p - points with respect to both the rk and tukey orders . in particular , for each @xmath56 , the ordinal @xmath32 embeds into the p - points with respect to both of these orders .    in this paper",
    ", we give a complete answer to question [ q : blass ] by showing that the ordinal @xmath3 can be embedded into the p - points under rk reducibility .",
    "our chain of p - points of length @xmath3 will also be strictly increasing with respect to tukey reducibility , so we get a positive answer to question 54 of @xcite as well .",
    "the construction will be presented assuming @xmath22 for simplicity .",
    "however the same construction can be run under @xmath23 with some fairly straightforward modifications",
    ". we will try to point out these necessary modifications at the appropriate places in the proofs below .",
    "we will make use of theorem [ thm : dt ] in our construction to ensure that our chain is also strictly increasing in the sense of tukey reducibility .",
    "however the continuity of the monotone maps will not be important for us .",
    "rather any other fixed collection of @xmath28 many monotone maps from @xmath57 to itself which is large enough to catch all tukey reductions from any p - point will suffice .",
    "for instance , it was proved in @xcite that the collection of monotone maps of the first baire class suffice to catch all tukey reductions from any basically generated ultrafilter , which form a larger class of ultrafilters than the p - points .",
    "so we could equally well have used monotone maps of the first baire class in our construction .",
    "a powerful machinery for constructing objects of size @xmath58 under @xmath59 was introduced by shelah , laflamme , and hart in @xcite .",
    "this machinery can be used to build a chain of p - points of length @xmath2 that is strictly increasing with respect to both rk and tukey reducibility assuming @xmath59 .",
    "more generally , the methods in @xcite allow for the construction of certain types of objects of size @xmath60 from a principle called @xmath61 , which is closely related to @xmath62 .",
    "shelah s results in @xcite imply that @xmath63 follows from @xmath23 when @xmath64 and is a successor cardinal .",
    "thus the methods of @xcite , when combined with the results of @xcite , can also be used to get a chain of p - points of length @xmath3 when @xmath64 , @xmath28 is a successor cardinal , and @xmath23 holds .",
    "however the techniques from @xcite are inadequate to treat the case when only @xmath22 holds .",
    "we use standard notation .",
    "`` @xmath65  '' abbreviates the quantifier `` for all but finitely many @xmath66  '' and `` @xmath67  '' stands for `` there exist infinitely many @xmath66 such that  '' .",
    "@xmath68}^{\\omega}$ ] refers to the collection of all infinite subsets of @xmath69 , and @xmath68}^ { < \\omega}$ ] is the collection of all finite subsets of @xmath69 .",
    "the symbol @xmath70 denotes the relation of containment modulo a finite set : @xmath71 iff @xmath72 is finite .",
    "even though the final construction uses @xmath22 , none of the preliminary lemmas rely on it .",
    "in fact , @xmath22 will only be used in section [ sec : long ] .",
    "the results in sections [ sec : prelim][sec : top ] are all in @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is needed later on to ensure that these results are sufficient to carry out the final construction and that they are applicable to it .",
    "so we do not need to make any assumptions about cardinal arithmetic at the moment .",
    "one of the difficulties in embedding various partially ordered structures into the p - points is that , unlike the class of all ultrafilters on @xmath69 , this class is not @xmath28-directed under @xmath31 .",
    "it is not hard to prove in @xmath21 that if @xmath73 is an arbitrary collection of ultrafilters on @xmath69 , then there is an ultrafilter @xmath10 on @xmath69 such that @xmath74 $ ] .",
    "however it is well - known that there are two p - points @xmath10 and @xmath13 with no rk upper bound that is a p - point under @xmath22 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "even if we restrict ourselves to chains , it is easy to construct , assuming @xmath22 , an rk chain of p - points @xmath75 which has no p - point upper bound .",
    "the strategy for ensuring that our chains are always extensible is to make each ultrafilter `` very generic '' ( with respect to some partial order to be defined in section [ sec : top ] ) .",
    "the same strategy was used in @xcite , but with one crucial difference .",
    "only @xmath28 many ultrafilters were constructed in @xcite and so all of the ultrafilters in question could be built simultaneously in @xmath28 steps .",
    "but by the time we get to , for example , the ultrafilter @xmath76 in our present construction , all of the ultrafilters @xmath77 , for @xmath78 , will have been fully determined with no room for further improvements . thus the ultrafilters that were built before should have already predicted and satisfied the requirements imposed by @xmath76 , and indeed by all of the ultrafilters to come in future .",
    "this is possible because there are only @xmath26 possible initial segments of ultrafilters .",
    "more precisely , each of the @xmath2 many p - points is generated by a @xmath79-descending tower @xmath80 .",
    "for each @xmath81 , the collection @xmath82 just has size @xmath26 .",
    "this leads to the notion of a @xmath0-generic sequence , which is essentially an rk - chain of p - points of length @xmath0 where every ultrafilter in the sequence has predicted and met certain requirements involving such initial segments of potential future ultrafilters and potential rk maps going from such initial segments into it .",
    "the precise definition is given in definition [ d22 ] .",
    "our main result is that such generic sequences can always be extended .",
    "[ r1 ] in the rest of the paper we will use the following notation :    * for @xmath83 , define @xmath84 and @xmath85 . * for @xmath86^{{\\omega}}$ ] , @xmath87 is the @xmath88th element of @xmath89 in its increasing enumeration .",

    "a function @xmath102 is _ increasing _ if @xmath103 $ ] .",
    "we also consider , for an ordinal @xmath104 , triples @xmath105 where @xmath106 is a sequence of sets in @xmath107 , @xmath108 is a sequence in @xmath5 and @xmath109 is a sequence in @xmath110 .",

    "next we recall the notion of a rapid ultrafilter .",
    "all the p - points in our construction will be rapid .",
    "this happens because the requirement of genericity forces our ultrafilters to contain some `` very thin '' sets",
