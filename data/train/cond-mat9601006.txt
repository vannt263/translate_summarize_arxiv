    "recently , the structure and properties of model and biological membranes have been studied extensively .",
    "biological membranes play a central role in both the structure and function of cells .",
    "biomembranes divide living tissue into different compartments or cells and act as cell boundaries .",
    "they determine the nature of all communication between the inside and the outside of cells .",
    "this communication can take place via the actual passage of ions or molecules between two compartments or via conformational changes induced in membrane components .",
    "model bilayer lipid membranes in aqueous environments exhibit many of the attributes of the biological membranes .",
    "for example , these membranes can form vesicles or more complex structures that divide space into separate compartments , which like cells can fuse or divide . however",
    ", there are many properties of biomembranes that can not be mimicked by lipid bilayers .",
    "energy - driven transport of ions across membranes and receptor - mediated events are only a few of the myriad of membrane - associated functions that lipid bilayers are incapable of performing on their own .",
    "such processes are mediated by proteins that are attached to or dissolved in biological membranes @xcite .",
    "thus in order to make lipid bilayers more realistic models of biomembranes , it is necessary to introduce into them membrane inclusions such as proteins .",
    "membrane proteins are classified as integral proteins or peripheral proteins according to how tightly they are associated with membranes .",
    "integral proteins are so tightly bound to membrane lipids by hydrophobic forces that they can be freed only under denaturing conditions .",
    "peripheral proteins associate with a membrane by binding at the membrane surface ; they can be non - destructively dissociated from the membrane by relatively mild procedures .",
    "some integral proteins , known as transmembrane proteins , span the membrane , whereas others are attached to a specific surface of a membrane . for brevity , we refer the latter proteins as non - transmembrane proteins to distinguish these from transmembrane proteins . however , no proteins are known to be completely buried in a membrane @xcite .",
    "interactions between membrane proteins is expected to be controlled by lipid affinity , direct interactions such as electrostatic and van der waals interactions , and indirect interactions mediated by the membrane @xcite .",
    "the latter interaction arises from thermally - driven undulations of the membrane and is analogous to the casimir force between conducting plates .",
    "since the degree to which fluctuations of a membrane are restricted depends on distance between membrane proteins , its free energy also depends on this distance , decreasing with decreasing separation .",
    "this implies an attractive force , which leads to a tendency for membrane proteins to aggregate .",
    "this indirect interaction between membrane inclusions was first calculated by goulian , bruinsma , and pincus @xcite . before presenting the interaction models introduced in this paper in detail , in sec.ii we will review its results , indicating where they differ from and extend those of goulian _",
    "_ in sec.iii , we introduce a phenomenological model ( model i ) for protein interactions . in this model ,",
    "proteins are characterized by symmetric - traceless tensors depending on the cross - section shapes of proteins on the membrane , and interactions are described by symmetry - allowed couplings between these tensor order - parameters and the curvature tensor of the fluctuating membrane . in sec.iv",
    ", we introduce another phenomenological model ( model ii ) , in which there is an interaction between a membrane protein and membrane lipids at its perimeter . at the perimeter , lipids tend to align with the direction of the protein at a certain angle depending on whether or not proteins break the up - down symmetry of the bilayer membrane .",
    "the interaction is described by the fluctuation of the normal vector of the membrane around this preferred direction .",
    "the interaction between non - transmembrane proteins is described in sec.v .",
    "non - transmembrane proteins are proteins with preferred center - of - mass positions not at the center of the bilayer membrane .",
    "we expand the potential energy in terms of the deviation from this preferred position and include other couplings considering the symmetry to calculate the interaction between non - transmembrane proteins .",
    "finally , a discussion is given in sec.vi .",
    "the interaction between membrane inclusions with circular cross - section on the membrane has been calculated by goulian _",
    "they use the helfrich - canham hamiltonian @xcite , @xmath3 to describe fluctuations of the membrane , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the bending and the gaussian rigidities and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the mean and the gaussian curvatures , respectively . the surface tension is not taken into account since it effectively vanishes @xcite . within inclusions with circular cross - section , the constants @xmath4 and @xmath5 are assumed to differ from those of the surrounding membranes . for some inclusions , such as proteins , the circular regions are assumed to be rigid with @xmath8 .",
    "this case is the strong - coupling regime . on the other hand , for regions with excess concentrations of lipids , @xmath4 and @xmath5 within circular regions",
    "are assumed to have values close to those of the surrounding membrane .",
    "this case is the perturbative regime . in both the strong - coupling and perturbative regimes , ref .",
    "@xcite finds that there is an entropic @xmath0 interaction , which is proportional to the temperature and to the square of the area of the circular region .",
    "also , at low temperatures , there is a non - entropic @xmath0 interaction between proteins which varies with the square of angle of contact between membrane and proteins .",
    "recently , golestanian , goulian , and kardar @xcite extended the calculation in ref .",
    "@xcite to the interaction between two rods embedded in a fluctuating membrane .",
    "they find an anisotropic @xmath0 interaction between two rods .      in this paper , we introduce three models for the interaction between membrane inclusions such as transmembrane proteins and non - transmembrane proteins .",
    "first , we present model i. here , proteins are characterized by symmetric - traceless tensor order - parameters , and the coupling between these order - parameters and membrane curvature is determined by symmetry and power counting . if proteins do nt respect up - down symmetry , we allow for couplings that break up - down symmetry .",
    "otherwise , we require up - down symmetry . for proteins with circular cross - sectional area on the membrane and preserving up - down symmetry , we find the leading distance - dependent free energy , @xmath9 , \\label{perturb}\\ ] ] where the coupling constants are denoted in terms of the bending and the gaussian rigidity differences , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , between proteins and surrounding membrane .",
    "this corresponds to the perturbative regime of ref .",
    "@xcite , whose results we reproduce . for proteins with circular cross - sectional area , up - down - symmetry - breaking couplings do not affect the leading contribution to the free energy , and the leading distance - dependent free energy remains identical to eq .",
    "( [ perturb ] ) .",
    "we also calculate interactions between proteins with non - circular cross - sectional area .",
    "when up - down symmetry is conserved , we find an interaction energy @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the cross - sectional area of proteins , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are magnitudes of 2nd - rank and 4th - rank tensor order parameters measuring orientational anisotropy , respectively , and @xmath16 are the angles of the directions of proteins measured with respect to the separation vector between proteins ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this anisotropic @xmath0 interaction contains anisotropic @xmath17 interaction in addition to anisotropic @xmath18 interaction also found in the recent independent work by golestanian _",
    "however , when up - down symmetry is broken , there is an anisotropic @xmath1 interaction : @xmath19 thus the leading term in the free energy falls off with separation as @xmath1 rather than @xmath0 .",
    "next , we introduce model ii in which we impose a certain boundary condition at the perimeter of proteins with the circular cross - sectional area . for proteins with up - down symmetry , we find @xmath20 this free energy looks similar to that of ref .",
    "@xcite in the strong - coupling regime .",
    "when proteins break up - down symmetry , we find @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the contact angle between the direction of @xmath23-th protein and the unit normal of the membrane ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) . in the limit @xmath24 , this free energy becomes the result in ref .",
    "@xcite for the low - temperature regime .",
    "finally , we introduce a height - displacement model in which protein positions normal to the membrane can vary . in this model , we find three- and four - body interactions in addition to a two - body interaction .",
    "these three- and four - body interactions also fall off as @xmath0 and are the same order of magnitude as two - body interaction .",
    "consequently , by introducing three models to describe the interaction between membrane inclusions such as proteins , we recover all the results in ref .",
    "furthermore , we obtain anisotropic interactions between proteins with non - circular cross - sectional area . also , we extend the calculation to the up - down symmetry breaking proteins with non - circular cross - section and find anisotropic @xmath1 interaction between them . moreover , using a height - displacement model , we find three- and four - body @xmath0 interaction in addition to two - body @xmath0 interaction .",
    "for a fluid membrane free of membrane proteins , the energy of membrane conformations can be described by the helfrich - canham hamiltonian @xcite , @xmath3 expressed in terms of the local mean and gaussian curvatures .",
    "we will work at length scales large compared with the membrane thickness but small compared with the membrane s persistence length .",
    "thus , we can parameterize the membrane in the monge gauge @xmath25 where @xmath26 . in terms of @xmath27 and the unit normal vector of the membrane @xmath28 ,",
    "the metric tensor @xmath29 is given by @xmath30 and the curvature tensor @xmath31 is given by @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the covariant derivative along @xmath34 direction on the membrane .",
    "in the monge gauge , @xmath35 @xmath36 when the topology of the membrane is fixed , the gaussian curvature term can be dropped , and the leading term in @xmath37 in an expansion in derivatives of @xmath38 is @xmath39 now let us consider the coupling between membrane proteins and membranes .",
    "membrane proteins can have arbitrary shapes ; as a result their tangent - plane cross - sections can be any shape .",
    "now we will compute the undulation mediated force between proteins separated by a distance larger than the size of proteins . for simplicity , let us first consider membrane proteins that have a circular cross - sectional area on the membrane .",
    "these proteins may be described by a scalar density , @xmath40 , which may be interpreted as the distribution function of proteins describing the positions of proteins and the configurations of protein s amino acid sequence @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a point on the membrane and the sum is over all proteins .",

    "both model i ( for soft inclusions ) and model ii ( for hard inclusions ) predict potentials that fall off with distance as @xmath194 .",
    "this interaction is attractive for hard inclusions .",
    "for soft inclusions the sign of the interaction depends on the relative sign of @xmath195 and @xmath61 and is attractive if they have opposite signs .",
    "reasonable models predict @xmath196 so that the prediction of models i and ii can be viewed as being consistent .    furthermore , we calculate the interaction between proteins with the non - circular cross - sectional area and find anisotropic @xmath1 and @xmath0 interactions depending on whether up - down symmetry is broken or not . in eq .",
    "( 2.3 ) , we find the interaction between proteins with non - circular cross - sectional area when up - down symmetry is conserved , and the free energy again falls off as @xmath0 but the magnitude depends on the orientations of inclusions .",
    "when only 4-fold anisotropy is nonvanishing , the angular dependence of the interaction is of the form @xmath18 .",
    "the interaction depends on the relative orientations of inclusions to the separation vector from one inclusion and the other .",
    "the interaction is attractive if @xmath197 and repulsive if @xmath198 .",
    "thus , depending on the orientations of the inclusions with respect to the separation vector , the interaction between two non - circular inclusions can be attractive or repulsive .",
    "in general , 2-fold and 4-fold anisotropies are nonvanishing and the resulting interaction has more complicated orientational dependence as shown in eq . ( 2.3 ) . in the case of",
    "broken up - down symmetry , the interesting aspect of the interaction in eq .",
    "( 2.4 ) , in addition to the orientational dependence of the force , is the leading distance - dependence @xmath1 rather than @xmath0 .",
    "the angular dependence in this case is of the form @xmath199 and the interaction is attractive if @xmath200 and repulsive if @xmath201 . in general , transmembrane proteins",
    "are asymmetrically embedded in the membrane , and they break up - down symmetry of bilayer membranes . thus , these proteins interact with anisotropic @xmath1 interaction , which is much stronger at large length - scale than the screened electrostatic interaction or the van der waals interaction under physiological conditions .",
    "consequently , for a distance large compared with a typical protein size , the interaction described in this paper will dominate over the electrostatic and the van der waals interactions .",
    "recently , we received the preprint by golestanian _",
    "_ @xcite in which they extend the calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite to the interaction between two rods on membranes . in their work",
    ", they retain the up - down symmetry for the rods and obtain anisotropic @xmath0 interaction similar to eq  ( [ quad - int ] ) .",
    "also , we d like to mention the calculation of the short - ranged induced interactions between inclusions embedded in fluid membrane by dan _",
    "they find a short - range repulsive interaction with decaying oscillation with period of order the membrane thickness when the two halves of a bilayer membrane are allowed to respond separately to the membrane inclusions .",
    "consequently , they suggest that in systems where the inclusions impose specific contact angles , a meta - stable state with a well - defined separation between neighboring inclusions is possible and the minimal energy state of the membrane is obtained at a finite inclusion spacing . the competition between this short - range repulsive force and the long - range attractive forces discussed by goulian _ et .",
    "al . _ and in this paper could lead to a preferred separation between membrane proteins .",
    "thus , it may be suggested that a hydrophilic channel through the bilayer can be formed by a ring of three or more transmembrane proteins , which may give some idea about how protein molecules can facilitate the passage of ions or molecules into and out of cells .",
