    "superluminous supernovae ( slsne ) are a newly recognized class of supernovae ( sne ) whose peak luminosity is more than about 10 times brighter than that of typical core - collapse sne @xcite .",
    "these powerful transients are therefore observable at cosmological distances although they are thought to be intrinsically rare  less than @xmath40.01% of the core - collapse population @xcite",
    ". how slsne achieve such high luminosities is not well - understood @xcite .",
    "one of the favoured models to explain their peak luminosity is the formation of a rapidly spinning , strongly magnetized neutron star ( ns ) , which is often called a ` magnetar ' in the literature .",
    "if such a magnetar has an initial magnetic dipole field strength of @xmath5 and an initial spin period of @xmath6 , a huge rotational energy reservoir can be emitted as magnetic dipole radiation to heat sn ejecta , thus making a sn superluminous @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , magnetars are also suggested to be strong sources of gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "the main reason for this is a geometric distortion of the ns caused by a strong toroidal magnetic field .",
    "rapid rotation of a time - varying quadrupole moment results in efficient emission of gravitational waves . if slsne are actually powered by magnetars , however , the released spin - down energy from magnetars must be dominated by electromagnetic radiation which can be thermalized in the sn ejecta .",
    "therefore , as gravitational waves can not power the sn ejecta , rotational energy loss by gravitational waves must be insignificant",
    ". a resulting criterion should be that the spin - down timescale by magnetic dipole radiation must be shorter than that by gravitational wave radiation ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "although magnetars are suggested to be distorted by their strong toroidal magnetic fields , it is not easy to constrain this distortion and its resulting ellipticity .",
    "furthermore , the toroidal magnetic field components themselves are also hard to determine observationally @xcite .",
    "an advantage of using slsne to constrain ns ellipticities is that we can use their light curves to estimate the spin period and the dipole magnetic field strength of these magnetars . assuming that magnetars are indeed distorted by toroidal magnetic fields , the derived limits on their ellipticities can be used to constrain the toroidal magnetic field strengths in these nss as an independent sanity check",
    "thus , we can constrain both poloidal and toroidal magnetic field strengths in magnetars in slsne via modelling of their light curves . in this letter",
    ", we show such constraints obtained from slsne for which light - curve modelling by magnetars has been performed .",
    "constraining both poloidal and toroidal field strengths in slsne also serves as an important test of the magnetar model of slsne .",
    "it is known that purely poloidal magnetic fields in nss are not stable , and toroidal magnetic fields which are much stronger than the poloidal fields are still required to have stable and significant poloidal magnetic fields ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . by constraining both poloidal and toroidal field strengths in magnetars powering slsne",
    ", we can check if these nss actually satisfy the stability condition , and thus , if the magnetar model of slsne is self - consistent .",
    "we consider a magnetar with a radius @xmath7 , a moment of inertia @xmath8 , and an initial spin period @xmath9 .",
    "the magnetar has a total rotational energy of @xmath10 .",
    "furthermore , we idealize the magnetar as a ns with the shape of a slightly deformed , homogeneous ellipsoid and thus having a small ellipticity of @xmath11 , where @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the principal moments of inertia of the ns and @xmath14 is assumed to be aligned with the spin axis .",
    "assuming quadrupolar gravitational wave radiation , the gravitational wave luminosity @xmath15 from the distorted magnetar is @xcite : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the gravitational wave emission timescale of the magnetar : @xmath18 @xmath19 is the speed of light , and @xmath20 is the gravitational constant . here , we assume that the angle between the spin axis and the principal axis of the ns distortion is @xmath21 @xcite . in principle , rapidly spinning nss may emit gravitational waves from a combination of ` mountain ' and ` wobble ' radiation , see e.g. @xcite for a recent discussion on cfs instabilities in the form of f modes ( bar - modes ) and r modes ( inertial modes , @xcite ) .",
    "however , their mode oscillation amplitudes are likely saturated at modest values , resulting in relatively long spin - down timescales of several years @xcite .    spinning magnetars with a misaligned magnetic dipole moment",
    "emit magnetic dipole radiation with a luminosity @xmath22 which is approximately given by @xcite : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the electromagnetic radiation timescale of the magnetar : @xmath25 @xmath26 is the dipole magnetic field strength at the pole , and @xmath27 is the misalignment angle between the spin axis and the magnetic dipole axis .",
    "we assume @xmath28 .      long rise times and large luminosities of slsne require extraordinary central engines . if magnetars power the observed light curves they must deposit their rotational energy of more than @xmath29 through electromagnetic radiation with a timescale of more than 10  days @xcite .",
    "this requires @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( table  [ table : nsepsilon ] ) .",
    "however , on the other hand , if the gravitational wave emission timescale is shorter than the electromagnetic emission timescale , the rotational energy of the magnetar is mainly lost by gravitational wave radiation and slsne can not be powered by magnetars .",
    "thus , we simply impose the condition that the gravitational wave emission timescale needs to be larger than the electromagnetic wave emission timescale in slsne , i.e. , @xmath32 . using equations  ( [ eq : tgw ] ) and ( [ eq : tem ] ) , we obtain the following constraint on the ns ellipticity , @xmath33{\\frac{5}{3g}}\\frac{cr^3p_0b_{\\rm dipole}}{2 ^ 4\\pi i}\\simeq3.0\\times 10^{-4}\\;\\left(\\frac{b_{\\rm dipole}}{10^{14}~\\mathrm{g}}\\right )                    \\left(\\frac{p_0}{1~\\mathrm{ms}}\\right ) , \\label{eq : elipticityconstraint}\\ ] ] where we apply fiducial ns properties of @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "table  [ table : nsepsilon ] summarizes the estimated magnetar properties ( @xmath26 and @xmath9 ) for observed slsne and their corresponding constraints on the ns ellipticity obtained with equation  ( [ eq : elipticityconstraint ] ) .",
    "the angle @xmath27 is defined differently depending on the reference in table  [ table : nsepsilon ] .",
    "we take @xmath36 in the literature and obtain @xmath26 by assuming @xmath28 ( see equation  [ eq : tem ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : bpdiagram ] depicts these values graphically .",
    "we can see that the absolute ns ellipticity typically needs to be less than @xmath37 for electromagnetic wave radiation to be more efficient than gravitational wave radiation in the observed slsne .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ , < \" , ]",
    "if we assume that a ns distortion is indeed caused by a strong internal toroidal magnetic field component , @xmath38 we can constrain the average value of this component by using a relation between @xmath39 and @xmath38 . if we take the suggested relation by @xcite , @xmath40 , and combine with equation  ( [ eq : elipticityconstraint ] ) , we can constrain @xmath38 as : @xmath41 the resulting constraints on @xmath38 are shown in table  [ table : nsepsilon ] and are typically less than a  few  @xmath42  g. this is close to the maximum toroidal magnetic field strength which can be achieved by the @xmath43 dynamo mechanism @xcite .    to secure a stable magnetic configuration , one must require @xmath44 @xcite . here , we have constraints on both magnetic field components from fitting a magnetar to the light curves of the slsne ( table  [ table : nsepsilon ] ) and the ratio of the two components is typically found to be @xmath45 .",
    "hence , the criterion for a stable magnetic field configuration is validated and our derived magnetar properties , obtained from the applied magnetar model for slsne , are self - consistent ( but see also @xcite ) .",
    "if future observations of slsne yield a much larger ratio of @xmath46 when applying the magnetar model it may well indicate that magnetars , at least in those cases , are not related to slsne .",
    "our estimate of the gravitational wave radiation timescale ( equation  [ eq : tgw ] ) is based on the assumption that the angle between the spin axis and the principal axis of the ns distortion is @xmath21 . furthermore , if this distortion in the ns quadrupole moment is caused by toroidal magnetic fields , then these fields should be orthogonalized to the spin axis @xcite . however , when magnetars are formed and their toroidal fields are wound up , their toroidal fields are presumed to be aligned , and not orthogonal , to the spin axis @xcite . therefore , if orthogonalization does not occur , then the toroidal magnetic fields are not able to distort the nss sufficiently to become efficient gravitational wave emitters .",
    "the timescale for this orthogonalization , or ` spin flipping ' , is quite uncertain @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that a critical ellipticity exists for newborn magnetars such that they will only cause spin flipping if @xmath47 for typical values of the ns mass density ( @xmath48 ) and radius ( 10  km ) . applying equation  ( [ eq : elipticityconstraint ] ) ,",
    "we obtain the dashed red line in figure  [ fig : bpdiagram ] , below which the estimated ellipticities are smaller than the critical ellipticity .",
    "hence , in all observed sources above this red dashed line , the magnetars might always be inefficient gravitational wave emitters and all their rotational energy loss can , in principle , be used to power the observed slsn light curves .",
    "sources below the red dashed line , can still power slsne if their ellipticities are smaller than the derived upper limits shown in table  [ table : nsepsilon ] .",
    "there are large uncertainties , however , in estimating the spin - flip criterion , and further investigation is needed on this issue .    a slight caveat of concern for our estimated description of @xmath49 is related to the validity of applying the simple magnetic dipole model to a magnetar in a sn .",
    "such a magnetar is surrounded by an expanding envelope and its braking torque depends on the boundary conditions at the wind - envelope interface . if initially the b - field does not penetrate the envelope , then the spin - down torque will be smaller @xcite ; if it penetrates , it will be larger ( since the field is twisted more and more ) .",
    "we also note that numerical magnetohydrodynamic simulations indicate that the spin - down luminosity may be larger than that obtained by the classical dipole formula by a factor of @xmath50 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , there are uncertainties in estimating @xmath51 and @xmath9 from slsn light curves .",
    "these magnetar properties are often entangled with sn properties such as ejecta mass , energy and opacity .",
    "this degeneracy can be partly solved by using the velocity information from spectra , but still yields @xmath52 and @xmath53 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "thus , we expect that @xmath51 and @xmath9 in table  [ table : nsepsilon ] have uncertainties by a factor of a few .",
    "we also note that the efficiency in converting magnetar dipole radiation to thermal energy can also affect the estimates of the magnetar properties @xcite .    the ellipticities and spins of nss at birth are not well constrained , especially not for magnetars .",
    "a recent study on the evolution of proto - nss @xcite suggests a minimum proto - ns spin period of about 3  ms ( obtained some 10  s after core bounce ) , and thus significantly larger than the mass - shedding limit of @xmath54 @xcite . however , several of the slsne investigated here require @xmath55 .",
    "therefore , if proto - nss ( magnetars ) are actually hard to spin up efficiently , then these slsne can not be powered by magnetars .",
    "there are several observational constraints on ellipticities of more evolved magnetars .",
    "@xcite estimated that the ellipticity of the magnetar 4u  0142 + 61 with @xmath56 is @xmath57 .",
    "if this deformation is due to a toroidal magnetic field component , the corresponding toroidal magnetic field strength is @xmath58 .    for ns mergers producing short gamma - ray bursts ,",
    "the resulting ( meta - stable ) magnetar is significantly more massive ( @xmath59 ) than a typical ns ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "hence , these sources can be efficient gravitational wave emitters via f - modes @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimated that magnetars with @xmath61 powering short gamma - ray bursts , have ellipticities of less than @xmath62 . in comparison , we find that magnetars potentially powering slsne have about an order of magnitude smaller values of @xmath26 and the magnetar ellipticities that we derived are typically less than a  few  @xmath37 .",
    "therefore , if magnetars power slsne then we do not expect to detect these ( extragalactic ) nss by any of the current ( aligo / virgo / kagra ) nor planned gravitational wave observatories ( einstein telescope ) , as their gravitational wave signals must be quite weak .",
    "we refer to @xcite for further discussion on the gravitational wave detectability from slsne .",
    "we have derived constraints on the ellipticity of magnetars powering slsne . for magnetars to power slsne",
    ", electromagnetic radiation should be the dominant channel to extract their large rotational energy reservoir .",
    "thus , the magnetar ellipticity must be small in order to prevent significant loss of rotational energy by gravitational wave radiation from geometrically distorted magnetars . here",
    ", we simply constrained the ellipticity by requiring that the electromagnetic radiation timescale should be shorter than gravitational wave radiation timescale in distorted magnetars .",
    "we find that the magnetar ellipticity , @xmath39 in slsne typically needs to satisfy @xmath63 .",
    "thus , their toroidal magnetic field strengths should be smaller than a  few  @xmath42  g. combined with the poloidal ( dipole ) magnetic field strengths constrained by light - curve modelling of slsne ( @xmath64  g ) , we find that the ratio of poloidal to toroidal field strengths is larger than @xmath3 in magnetars powering slsne .",
    "this ratio is small enough to secure stable magnetic configuration in magnetars powering slsne and thus the magnetar model for slsne is found to be self - consistent so far .",
    "this work is based on discussions following a presentation by tjm at the _ 8th bonn workshop on formation and evolution of neutron stars_. we thank nils andersson and kostas kokkotas for discussions on r - mode and f - mode instabilities of magnetars , and maxim lyutikov for insight on the spin - down of a magnetar in a sn .",
