    "recently , the electronic transport properties through the graphene nanoribbons ( gnrs ) have attracted a great deal of interest due to the potential applications in nano electronic devices @xcite .",
    "so devices have designed in such a way that a gnr is sandwiched between two metalic or organic electrodes . the tiny dimension ,",
    "strike and profound physical properties of these structures make them prospective candidates for future generation of nano - devices in electronic engineering .",
    "one of the prominent factors in the transport properties through the nano scale structures is the quantum interference ( qi ) effects which attracted much more attention in the past few years @xcite .",
    "such effects occur when electron waves pass through nano junctions in a phase - coherent fashion and depend crucially on symmetry .",
    "the relevance of qi effects has been first observed in the context of waveguides for semiconductor nanostructures @xcite , but it has also been recognized early on theoretically @xcite and experimentally@xcite .",
    "qi effects in graphene subjected to a perpendicular magnetic field , such as current revivals@xcite or aharonov  bohm conductance oscillations in ring - shaped devices have also been investigated @xcite .",
    "munarriz et al@xcite investigated qi effects in a type of qi device based on a graphene nanoring in which all edges are of the same type and they have shown that the superposition of the electron wavefunction propagating from the source to the drain along the two arms of the nanoring gives rise to interesting interference effects .    in the other hand , to obtain additional information about charge carriers in transport phenomena one can study noise power of the current fluctuations ( of thermal or quantum origin ) which give several key ideas for fabrication of the efficient nano - electronic devices . in order to design nanometer junctions with the lowest possible noise power , it is necessary to have an efficient algorithm to calculate the noise power current fluctuations . in a review work ,",
    "blanter and bttiker have shown clearly and elaborately how the lowest possible noise power of the current fluctuations can be determined in a two - terminal conductor @xcite .",
    "shot noise ( steady - state current fluctuation ) which is a consequence of the granularity of charge has been the subject of intensive theoretical and experimental research @xcite .",
    "in addition , relying on the theory of shot noise @xcite one may define a fano factor ( f ) which presents information about electron correlations of the system .    in the present paper , motivated by the significantly improved switching characteristics of the short organic field effect transistors ( ofet ) with carbon nanotube ( cnt ) electrodes compared to the metallic ones @xcite",
    ", we have numerically investigated the effects of qi on the noise power and fano factor of the armchair graphene nanoribbon ( agnr ) sandwiched between an armchair @xmath2 single - walled carbon nanotube electrodes ( cnt / agnr / cnt system ) as an all carbon base nano - junction .",
    "our calculations based on tight - binding model and a generalized green s function method in landauer - bttiker formalism . in this work , changing the agnr to cnt electrodes contact positions and applying the magnetic field as two sources of qi are considered .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the model , hamiltonian and formalism are given in section ii . in section iii , we present the results of the numerical calculations .",
    "finally , conclusion is given in section iv .    , @xmath3 and @xmath4 . ]",
    "we start with fig.([p1 ] ) , * _ where an agnr lattice with @xmath5 and three unit cells _ * , subject to a perpendicular magnetic field is attached to two semi - infinite armchair ( 5,5 ) single - walled cnt electrodes .",
    "these electrodes are characterized by the electrochemical potentials @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively , under the non - equilibrium condition when an external bias voltage is applied .",
    "the hamiltonian representing the entire system can be written as a sum of four terms , @xmath8 where @xmath9 represents the hamiltonian of the left ( right ) cnt electrode which is described within the tight binding approximation and is written as @xmath10 here @xmath11 denotes the creation ( annihilation ) operator of an electron at site @xmath12 in the electrode @xmath13 . @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the on - site energy and the nearest - neighbor hopping integral , respectively . in the absence of cnt electrodes ,",
    "the hamiltonian of agnr may be described by tight - binding model within the non - interacting picture like , @xmath16 the index @xmath17 runs over the @xmath18-orbitals of the carbon atom on the gnr .",
    "the operator @xmath19 creates ( annihilates ) an electron at site @xmath17 on the agnr .",
    "@xmath20 is the on - site energy of a carbon atom .",
    "@xmath21 corresponds to the nearest - neighbor hopping integral between the carbon atoms in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "the effect of magnetic field @xmath22 is incorporated in the hopping term @xmath21 through the peierl s phase factor and for a chosen gauge field it becomes , @xmath23 where , t gives the nearest - neighbor hopping integral in the absence of magnetic field and @xmath24 is the elementary quantum flux .",
    "finally in eq.([e1 ] ) , @xmath25 denotes the coupling between the agnr and cnt electrodes and takes the form ; @xmath26 where the matrix elements @xmath27 represent the coupling strength between the gnr , and cnt electrodes are taken to be @xmath28 .",
    "the green s function of the cnt / agnr / cnt junction can be written as @xmath29^{-1 } , \\label{e6}\\ ] ] where 1 stands for the identity matrix and @xmath30 is the self - energy matrix resulting from the coupling of agnr to the left ( right)cnt electrode and given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the coupling matrix and it will be non - zero only for the adjacent points in the agnr and the cnt electrode .",
    "@xmath33 is the green s function of the semi - infinite isolated electrodes and given by @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 , with @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "we assume the @xmath38 direction to be parallel to the tube and @xmath39 to be the finite transverse coordinate .",
    "the surface green s function of cnt electrodes are given by @xcite @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 in general , there are @xmath43 atomic positions over the interfacial end - atoms of the nanotube .",
    "for an armchair @xmath2 single - walled carbon nanotube ( swnt ) topology imposed , the number of carbon sites at the interface are @xmath44",
    ". the transmission probability @xmath45 can be expressed in terms of the green s function of the agnr and the coupling of the agnr with two cnt electrodes by expression @xmath46    where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are respectively the retarded and advanced green s function .",
    "the broadening matrix @xmath49 is defined as the imaginary part of the self - energy ; @xmath50 transmission function tells us the rate at which electrons transmit from the left to the right electrode by propagating through the agnr . in the low bias limit ,",
    "the current as a function of the applied voltage @xmath51 can be calculated in the landauer - bttiker formula based on the non - equilibrium greend function method @xcite ; @xmath52 de . \\label{e13}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is the fermi distribution function at the left ( right ) electrode with chemical potential @xmath54 and fermi energy @xmath55 . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", here we assume that the total voltage is dropped across agnr interface and this assumption does not eminently affect the qualitative aspects of current - voltage ( @xmath56 ) characteristics .",
    "in fact the electric field inside the agnr , particularly for narrow agnr , seems to have a negligible effect on the @xmath56 characteristics . on the contrary , for quite larger agnr and higher bias voltages ,",
    "the electric field inside the agnr may play a more remarkable role depending on the structure and size of the agnr @xcite , but yet the effect is very small .",
    "the noise power of the current fluctuations provides additional insight into the quantum transport properties and statistics of the electron transfer .",
    "the zero - frequency noise power of the current fluctuations is given through the following relation @xcite ; @xmath57\\ , de .",
    "\\label{e14}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first two terms describe equilibrium noise originated from thermal fluctuation in the left and right electrodes , respectively .",
    "these contributions vanish at zero temperature .",
    "the last term describe shot noise term due to the discrete nature of the electron transport .",
    "a suitable measure of the magnitude of the shot noise is fano factor contains additional considerable information about electron correlation in the system @xcite and is given as @xmath58 with @xmath59 being the elementary quantum of charge .",
    "the full shot noise is characterized by @xmath0 . in this case",
    "the shot noise achieves the poisson limit where there is no correlation between the charge carriers .",
    "for @xmath1 the sub - poisson value of shot noise is achieved where electron correlations reduce the level of current fluctuations below the poisson limit .",
    "here , we represent the results of the numerical calculations based on the formalism described in section 2 .",
    "we set the carbon on - site energy and hopping energies of agnr as @xmath60 and @xmath61 , respectively .",
    "the tight - binding parameters for cnt electrodes are chosen to be @xmath62 , @xmath63 . as a reference energy , the fermi energy of cnt electrodes",
    "is set @xmath64 . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we consider elementary quantum flux and lattice constant in agnr as @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively .",
    "in addition , we set @xmath67 and @xmath68 .     of the cnt / agnr / cnt junction in the absence of magnetic field for different @xmath69 and @xmath4 cases . ]    in fig .",
    "[ p2 ] , we illustrate the logarithmic scale of transmission function versus energy of the cnt / agnr / cnt junction in the absence of magnetic field for @xmath69 and @xmath4 cases ( see fig.[p1 ] ) . as shown in fig.[p2 ] , for an electron with energy @xmath70 , comes from the left electrode , the probability of transmission function reaches its saturated value ( resonance peaks ) for the particular energy values .",
    "these resonance peaks are related to the eigenenergies of the individual agnr .",
    "when the electrons travel from left cnt electrode to the right one through the agnr , the electron waves propagating along the two branches of agnr may suffer a relative phase shift between themselves . consequently , there might be constructive or destructive interference due to the superposition of the electronic wave functions along the various pathways .",
    "therefore , the transmission probability will change .",
    "we observe some anti - resonant states appear in the transmission probability in the @xmath71 and @xmath3 cases . in case @xmath71",
    "there are two types of qi effects known as fano - resonance ( asymmetric line shape ) about @xmath72 and anti - resonance ( symmetric line shape ) about @xmath73 , while in case @xmath3 the fano - resonance only exists .",
    "critical difference between these qi effects is that a fano - resonance does require a localized state at the position of the asymmetric peak , however an anti - resonance does not require a localized state at the position of a negative peak . to obtain a deeper insight into the electron transport through the cnt / agnr / cnt junction ,",
    "we have plotted the current , noise power and fano factor as a function of applied voltage for the three @xmath69 and @xmath4 cases in the absence of magnetic field in fig .",
    "an applied voltage shifts the chemical potentials of two cnt electrodes relative to each other by @xmath74 , with @xmath59 the electronic charge . when the agnr energy level is positioned within such bias window , current will flow .",
    "for the same voltage @xmath51 the current amplitude of the three @xmath69 and @xmath4 cases exhibit different response to the applied bias voltage @xmath51 .",
    "this is due to the qi effects of the electron waves traversing through the different branches of the agnr .     and @xmath4 cases . ]",
    "it is observed that the @xmath56 curves shows staircase - like structure which indicates that a new channel is opened . with the increase of the bias voltage @xmath51 ,",
    "the electrochemical potentials on the electrodes are shifted gradually , and finally cross one of the quantized energy levels of the agnr .",
    "therefore , a current channel is opened up and provides a jump in the @xmath56 characteristic .",
    "apart from different current amplitude that three @xmath69 and @xmath4 cases show , they also show different threshold voltage @xmath75 in which the current appears .",
    "indeed , two @xmath3 and @xmath4 cases have shown almost same threshold voltage @xmath75 which is much more smaller than case @xmath71 .",
    "of the cnt / agnr / cnt junction for different @xmath69 and @xmath4 cases for different magnetic fields strength @xmath76 and @xmath77 . ]     and magnetic field @xmath78 for different @xmath69 and @xmath4 cases . ]     and magnetic field @xmath78 for different @xmath69 and @xmath4 cases . ]     and magnetic field @xmath78 for different @xmath69 and @xmath4 cases . ]",
    "we have also depicted the noise power of current fluctuations , middle panel of fig .",
    "[ p3 ] , for the three @xmath69 and @xmath4 cases as a function of the bias voltage .",
    "it is apparent that the noise power and current have analogous step characteristics with increasing bias - voltage .",
    "the noise power in the case @xmath71 has least magnitude in compare with the two @xmath3 and @xmath4 cases .",
    "the one point which should also be addressed is that though the general behaviour of the noise power and current are the same , but cases @xmath3 and @xmath4 changes their relative trend in response to the bias - voltage .",
    "the bottom panel of fig . [ p3 ] shows the bias - voltage dependent fano factor for the cnt / agnr / cnt system .",
    "it should be noticed that we neglect all the interactions between current carriers and electron correlations are associated only with the pauli principle .",
    "after the first step in @xmath56 curve , the shot noise goes from the poisson limit @xmath79 to sub - poisson region @xmath80 for the case @xmath71 .",
    "this demonstrates that the electrons are correlated after the tunneling process .",
    "this behavior does not exist for two @xmath3 and @xmath4 cases since the shot noise already attains the sub - poisson region .    in what follows",
    ", we will apply an external magnetic field perpendicular to the agnr and check its effect on the transport properties of the three @xmath69 and @xmath4 cases . in fig .",
    "[ p4 ] , we show logarithmic scale of transmission function versus energy of the cnt / agnr / cnt junction in the presence of magnetic field @xmath78 for the different @xmath69 and @xmath4 cases .",
    "a remarkable feature which happens after applying magnetic field is that band gap starts to change by increasing magnetic field .",
    "this is due to variation of the hopping integral @xmath81 in the presence of magnetic field . in all the three @xmath69 and @xmath4 cases",
    ", tuning magnetic field strength brings different trend in the transmission function .",
    "for example in case @xmath71 , by increasing magnetic field strength anti - resonance at fermi energy shows very sharp fall due to decreasing band gap",
    ". it can be exploit to have high thermopower @xmath82 ( measures the logarithmic first derivative of the transmission function at fermi energy ) .",
    "apart from the anti - resonance at fermi energy , one can also see two other anti - resonances about energy @xmath83 for the presented window of energy . as already mentioned above",
    ", this type of qi effects does not need local density of state . in cases @xmath3 and @xmath4 , we havent seen any anti - resonance type of qi effects , while by increasing magnetic field strength some fano - resonance appears .",
    "these qi effects take place for magnetic field bigger than @xmath84 . in fig.[p5 ] , we present local density of state(ldos ) of cnt / agnr contact position as function of the injecting electron energy @xmath70 and magnetic field @xmath78 for different @xmath69 and @xmath4 cases .",
    "[ p5](a ) clearly shows some off state region ( black islands ) which give rise to anti - resonance qi effects .",
    "as the magnetic field grows , off state region around fermi energy gradually starts to narrow .",
    "this behaviour reveals the transmissions trend around the fermi energy for case @xmath71 . for higher magnetic field",
    "the off state region at fermi energy shows robust trend and exists for a whole cycle of magnetic flux ( see fig .",
    "moreover , for higher magnetic field one can also see two off state region symmetric respect to the injected energy which can give rise to some new anti - resonances .",
    "one more thing should be addressed here is that about @xmath85 and @xmath86 there are two regions with high ldos(hot - red ) which can introduce fano - resonance in case @xmath71 . in cases @xmath3 and @xmath4 , ldos spectrum dose not show any off state region and it is in well agreement with transmission function which dose not show any anti - resonances .",
    "in addition , the signature of fano - resonances are couple with high ldos ( hot - red ) regions that clearly appear for @xmath84 . now for further clarification in fig .",
    "[ p6 ] , we have illustrated current , noise power and fano factor as function of applied bias voltage and magnetic field @xmath78 for different @xmath69 and @xmath4 cases .",
    "both current and noise power show almost same trend in respect to the bias voltage and magnetic field . in case @xmath71 ,",
    "presence of a threshold voltage @xmath75 ( dark - black region ) is clear and it goes to disappear by growing magnetic field strength which can be referred as the band gap narrowing .",
    "this threshold voltage dose not exist in two @xmath3 and @xmath4 cases in which current follows immediate after turning bias voltage and finds it saturation value for higher voltage . comparing current density plots of three @xmath69 and @xmath4 cases",
    "also shows that for presented window of bias voltage and magnetic field , case @xmath4 finds its saturation value for broader region .",
    "as it can be seen from the noise power for case @xmath71 in the presence of applied magnetic field , the noise power goes from the poisson limit @xmath79 to sub - poisson region @xmath80 .",
    "this transition takes place in different bias voltages due to the decreasing threshold voltage @xmath75 .",
    "case @xmath3 shows poisson limit @xmath79 for very tiny region about @xmath87 and low bias , elsewhere shows the sub - poisson limit . in case @xmath4 ,",
    "the noise power for different magnetic field strengths lies in the sub - poisson limit .        in fig .",
    "[ p7 ] , we have shown the ab oscillations in the logarithmic scale of transmission probability as a function of magnetic flux ( @xmath88 ) for injection energy of the tunneling electron @xmath89 for the different @xmath69 and @xmath4 cases .",
    "transmission probability shows periodic pattern with a period of @xmath90 .",
    "this periodicity is seen for all energies of tunneling electron which is not presented here .     for different",
    "@xmath69 and @xmath4 cases . ]",
    "in summary , we have numerically investigated the coherent electron transport through armchair graphene nanoribbon ( agnr ) sandwiched between carbon nanotube ( cnt ) electrodes as cnt / agnr / cnt system . using the generalized green s function technique based on tight - binding model and the landauer - bttiker formalism",
    ", we have calculated the transmission probability , current , noise power and fano factor in the * _ presence _ * of magnetic field .",
    "we have also considered three different contact positions cases(as labeled @xmath69 and @xmath4 ) in order to check the existence of quantum interference(qi ) ( see fig .",
    "our calculations show the presences of two type of qi effects which can lead to appear anti - resonance and fano - resonance * _ peaks _ * in the transmission probability which can affect on the transport properties of the cnt / agnr / cnt system . it is found that all the three @xmath69 and @xmath4 cases display different current and noise power amplitudes .",
    "moreover , they show different threshold voltages @xmath75 in which the current and noise power occurs . indeed",
    ", two @xmath3 and @xmath4 cases show almost same threshold voltages @xmath75 which are much more smaller than case @xmath71 .",
    "we have also considered two qi sources , contact positions and magnetic field , to check their mutual effects on the coherent transport characteristics of cnt / agnr / cnt system .",
    "our calculations unveil that in all the three @xmath69 and @xmath4 cases by changing magnetic field , the current amplitude and threshold voltage @xmath75 starts to change .",
    "our results also show that the shot noise characteristic , in the poisson limit ( @xmath0 ) or sub - poisson limit ( @xmath1 ) , and the maximum value of the fano factor * _ strongly _ * depend on contact positions and the magnetic field strength .",
    "thus we can emphasize that the transport properties of the cnt / agnr / cnt system such as noise power and fano factor can be controlled very significantly by tuning the qi effects .",
    "these phenomena can be utilized in designing the future nano - electronic devices .",
