    "this paper is a contribution to the theory of random walks on random networks . here , the underlying graph is an infinite supercritical galton  watson tree with independent conductances whose distribution may depend on the degree of the incident vertices .",
    "it is not difficult to see that such random walks are transient ; see proposition  [ p_transience ] .",
    "we denote the random walk by  @xmath6 .",
    "we say that there is a law of large numbers if there exists a deterministic  @xmath0 ( the rate of escape , or the speed ) such that  @xmath7 a.s.,where ,  @xmath2 stands for the distance from the root .",
    "a standard method to prove laws of large numbers is to work in the space of rooted weighted trees and to consider the environment observed by the particle .",
    "this approach has the advantage , provided one is able to construct a stationary measure , that it gives rise to a stationary ergodic markov chain and one can apply the ergodic theorem . we identify the reversible measure for the environment in section  [ s_env ] and prove a formula for the speed which involves effective conductances of subtrees , see theorem  [ thm : speed ] .",
    "a first consequence is that the speed is a.s",
    ".  positive . for",
    "the case of non - degenerate random conductances having the same mean we show a _ slowdown result _ :",
    "the speed of the random walk with random conductances is strictly smaller than the speed of the simple random walk . finally , we consider an example on the binary tree , see proposition  [ ex1 ] , where explicit asymptotic results are obtained .",
    "this example illustrates how the choice of the random environment influences the speed of the random walk .",
    "simple random walks on galton  watson trees were studied in  @xcite where among other results a law of large number is proved , using the environment observed by the particle . in  @xcite",
    "one finds more references and details about this and related models .",
    "there are mainly two generalizations of this model .",
    "the first is the so - called  @xmath8-biased random walk . in this model",
    "the random walk chooses the direction towards the root with probability proportional to  @xmath8 while the probability to choose any of the sites in the opposite direction is proportional to  @xmath9 . in",
    "@xcite it was proved that the  @xmath8-biased random walk is positive recurrent if  @xmath10 , null recurrent if  @xmath11 , and transient otherwise . here ,  @xmath12 is the mean number of offspring of the galton  watson process . in the transient case ,",
    "it was shown in  @xcite and  @xcite that  @xmath13 a.s . , where  @xmath14 is deterministic .",
    "an explicit formula for  @xmath14 is only known for  @xmath15 ( that is , for the case of srw ) . for  @xmath16 ,",
    "@xcite proves a quenched central limit theorem for  @xmath17 by constructing a stationary measure for the environment process . in the critical case , @xmath11",
    ", the central limit theorem has the following form : for almost every realization of the tree , the ratio @xmath18}|/\\sqrt{n}$ ] converges in law as  @xmath19 to a deterministic multiple of the absolute value of a brownian motion .",
    "the second generalization are random walks in random environment ( rwre ) on galton  watson trees .",
    "the main difference to our work is that while in our model the conductances are realizations of an independent environment , in the rwre model the _ ratios _ of the conductances are realizations of an i.i.d .  environment .",
    "therefore , the behaviour of rwre is richer ; the walk may be recurrent or transient and the speed positive or zero .",
    "we refer to  @xcite and  @xcite and references therein for recent results .",
    "our model can also be seen from a more general point of view as an example of a stationary random network .",
    "a stationary random network is a random rooted network whose distribution is invariant under re - rooting along the path of the random walk ( defined through the corresponding electric network ) started at the original root .",
    "this notion generalizes the concept of transitive networks where the condition of transitivity is replaced by the assumption that an invariant distribution along the path of the random walk exists . under first moment conditions ,",
    "this model is also known as a unimodular random network , see @xcite and @xcite , or an invariant measure of a graphed equivalence relation .",
    "in fact , unimodular random networks correspond to stationary and reversible random networks .",
    "a straightforward consequence of the stationarity and the sub - additive ergodic theory , see e.g. @xcite , is the existence of the speed , i.e. , for almost every realization of a stationary and reversible random network , @xmath20 converges almost surely .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec_model ]",
    "we give a formal description and notations of the model . the environment observed by the particle",
    "is introduced in section  [ s_env ] and in section  [ s_speed ] we present the main results that are proved in section  [ s_proofs ] .",

    "one vertex  @xmath22 is singled out and called the root of the tree .",
    "the rooted tree is then denoted by  @xmath23 .",
    "we use the same notation  @xmath21 for the set of vertices of the tree and the tree itself ; the set of edges is denoted by  @xmath24 . for a vertex  @xmath25",
    "we denote by  @xmath26 the degree of  @xmath27 ( i.e. , the number of edges incident to  @xmath27 ) .",

    ". then , for a fixed tree  @xmath21 and any nonnegative integers  @xmath33 , define @xmath34 to be the set of edges connecting vertices of indices  @xmath35 and  @xmath12 .",

    "weight _ of the edge . in our model",
