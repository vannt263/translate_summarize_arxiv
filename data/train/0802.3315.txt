    "the preparation of the corot  mission brought up the need of a reference grid of stellar models in order to locate the possible corot  targets in the hertzsprung - russell ( hr ) diagram , and to allow a first interpretation of the forthcoming corot - data .",
    "for this purpose , several grids of stellar models were computed according to the esta - task1 specifications . in this paper",
    "we present the grids of stellar models we computed with the code cls  @xcite , as well as the seismic properties we derived by using the adiabatic oscillation code losc  @xcite for models on the main sequence ( ms ) or close to it .    in sections  [ fisica ] and [ starparam ]",
    "we describe , respectively , the input physics and the set of stellar parameters we used . the evolutionary tracks , stellar models and oscillation frequency data can be found on the esta  web site .",
    "the description of all this material is given in sect.[data ] for the evolution and structure models , and in sect.[freqs ] for the seismic properties of the stellar models . finally , in sect .",
    "[ conclu ] we summarize the type and amount of available files .",
    "for three out of four stellar model grids we adopted the reference input physics , as well as the physical and astronomical constants specified for estatask  1 comparisons ( see also sect.5 in * ? ? ?",
    "we stress that these specifications do not always coincide with those of the standard version of cls  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* * equation of state ( eos ) *  opal  2001 equation of state @xcite available in the opal web site .",
    "the tabulated values of @xmath0 have been replaced with the values derived from the tabulated values of @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 . for each @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 we interpolate in the tables by using our own interpolation routine . * * opacities * ",
    "opal96 @xcite .",
    "the opacity tables used in cls  have been calculated on - line for the standard gn93 @xcite metal mixture , and using the smoothing routine available in the opal web site to build the final opacity tables .",
    "the low temperature opacity tables by @xcite are also smoothly added ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and conductive opacities were not included in these computations . as for eos , we interpolate in @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 by using our own interpolation routines . * * nuclear network *  we choose the same nuclear network as in model comparison , that is , basic pp chain and cno cycle reactions up to the @xmath9 .",
    "we adopted the nuclear reaction rates from the analytical formulae provided by the nacre compilation @xcite , including that one for the @xmath10 , and the weak screening factors from @xcite . the electronic density , taking part in the screening factor computation ,",
    "was estimated assuming full ionization of chemical elements . *",
    "* chemical composition *  we adopted the metal distribution provided by the @xcite ( thereafter gn93 ) solar mixture .",
    "only the abundances of light elements ( li , be and b ) were modified to be consistent with those used in cesam .",
    "the isotopic ratios are those of @xcite except for the @xmath11h/@xmath12h and @xmath13he/@xmath14he ratios for which we took those of @xcite .",
    "* * convection *  all the evolutionary tracks were computed with the classical mixing length treatment of convection by @xcite and the formulation of @xcite for optically thin regions .",
    "the mixing length parameter @xmath15 was fixed at 1.6 for all the grids .",
    "note that the latter is the value chosen for esta comparisons , but it does not correspond to the value derived from a solar calibration . *",
    "* overshooting . *",
    "all the models , regardless of their mass , were computed without convective core overshooting . *",
    "* atmosphere . * esta ",
    "task1 specification requires the surface boundary conditions to be provided by integration of a grey atmosphere following the eddington s @xmath16 law ( grey models , thereafter ) .",
    "three of the four stellar model grids were computed following the esta  specification , while for the fourth one , temperature and density at @xmath17 were obtained from kurucz s atmosphere models @xcite .",
    "we provide evolutionary tracks for masses from 0.8 to 8  , with a mass step @xmath18=0.1 , from 0.8 to 1.6  , @xmath18=0.2 up to 4.0  , and @xmath18=0.5 from 4.0 to 8.0  .",
    "the initial hydrogen mass fraction is @xmath19 in all grids .",
    "three different values of the metal mass fraction @xmath8 ( 0.02 , 0.01 and 0.006 ) are available for grids of grey models , while only @xmath20 has been considered in the grid computed with kurucz atmosphere boundary conditions .",
    "for each stellar parameter ( @xmath21 ) we follow the pms  evolution from the hayashi track , and the calculation ends either when the temperature at the stellar center is high enough to burn he , or when the age of the model is larger than 20  gyr .",
    "we recall that the computation of these models does not include conductive opacities and that these ones should be taken into account in modeling low mass stars up to the helium ignition .",
    "the grids of these evolutionary tracks are available from the esta web site and consist of * two * hrd - files , whose name contains the values of the stellar parameters for which they were computed . for instance , `` m1.00z0.02x0.70-hrd1.txt '' and `` m1.00z0.02x0.70-hrd2.txt '' contain the evolutionary tracks for a 1.00  star with initial chemical composition @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the first four lines in hrd1 and hrd2-files provide information about the stellar parameters and the input physics used to build the model .",
    "since most of them have already been described in previous section , we only mention that * fg * and * ft * indicate the factor by which the mesh and time step were multiplied . both , fg and ft were set equal to 0.5 , that is , the number of mesh points and the temporal steps were doubled with respect to the standard value used in cls  @xcite .",
    "the quantities for which the temporal evolution were tabulated in the hrds files are the following :    hrd1 files :    * * column 1 *  stellar mass in units of . *",
    "* column 2 *  stellar luminosity ( @xmath22 ) . *",

    "[ ms ] for the ms  and post - ms  evolutionary phases . for each mass there is a pair of curves , one was computed with eddington s law as boundary conditions at the photosphere ( solid lines ) and the other used kurucz s atmosphere models ( dashed lines ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that , as it concerns the theoretical hr  diagram , the atmosphere type affects only models with effective temperature lower than 6300  k. the effects on the seismic properties will be discussed in sect .",
    "[ freqs ] .    in fig .",
    "[ ms ] we marked the model locations at the middle of their ms  ( central hydrogen mass fraction @xmath36 ) by open circles and that of models with a central hydrogen mass fraction @xmath37 by filled ones . defining the beginning of ms  by the model with a central mass fraction of hydrogen decreased by 1% with respect to the initial one ( that is @xmath38 for the present computations ) , and its end by that with @xmath37 , the ms - lifetime varies from @xmath39  yrs for 8  to more than 13  gyr for 0.9  .",
    "the number of computed stellar models that span the main sequence phase of evolution is of the order of 160 for each ( @xmath21 ) .    the dependence on the stellar mass of the convective core mass , for models in the middle of ms is shown in fig .",

    "[ mhe ] we show the mass of the he core at the end of the ms  as a function of the stellar mass .",
    "in addition to the evolutionary tracks , a selection of internal structure models for each @xmath40 are also available :    * * zams * model - defined as the model for which the ratio of gravitational to nuclear luminosity is lower than 2% . * * 1ms * model - as the model which has burned 1% of h ( @xmath41 ) . *",

    "that means about 30 models for each set of stellar parameters .",
    "an individual file is provided for each stellar model whose name is formed with the stellar parameters , for example : m1.00z0.02x0.70-####.gong , where `` # # # # '' can be `` zams '' , `` 1ms '' , `` ms '' , `` tams '' , or a number corresponding to the number of the model .",
    "the format adopted for these files is the one with the first twenty - five variables .",
    "the number of mesh points through the stellar interior is of the order of 2200 , and 100 additional mesh points are used to describe the stellar atmosphere from an optical depth @xmath45 outwards , up to @xmath46 .    among the physical quantities stored in   files",
    "there are the mass fraction of the most important contributors to nuclear energy generation . for illustration ,",
    "we show in figs .",
    "[ hecn ] the chemical profile of key elements such as @xmath13he , @xmath47c , and @xmath48n inside the stellar models in the mid  ms .",
    "for each equilibrium model in fgong format , we also provide a file containing the properties of radial and non radial oscillation modes with spherical degree @xmath49 2 , and 3 .",
    "these properties were computed by using the code losc  @xcite with the standard surface boundary condition ( regularity of solution when @xmath50 at the surface , that is , @xmath51 ) .",
    "the angular frequencies of the computed oscillation modes cover the domain given by 0.350 times the dynamical time ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "the file name is the same as that of the equilibrium model but with the extension `` .freq '' ; the content is the following :    * * column 1 *  spherical angular degree @xmath53 . * * column 2 *  radial order @xmath54 . *",
    "* column 3 *  dimensionless frequency @xmath55 . * * column 4 *  angular frequency @xmath56 * * column 5 *  frequency @xmath57 in hz . *",
    "* column 6 *  period @xmath1 in seconds . * * column 7 *  @xmath58 gives the frequency shift generated by solid rotation , where @xmath59 is the ledoux s constant @xcite .",
    "* * column 8 *  fraction of the kinetic energy associated to the radial component of the motion @xmath60 * * column 9 * ",
    "@xmath61 is the mean value of @xmath62 weighted by the kinetic energy of the oscillation mode , and determines in which region the mode is trapped . *",
    "* column 10 *  @xmath63 , that takes values between 0 and 1 , vanishes for a perfectly trapped mode .",
    "since discontinuities in the sound speed derivatives in the stellar interior ( such as those introduced by the boundaries of the convective regions and by the second helium ionization zone ) produce periodic signatures in the frequencies of low degree modes ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we decided to provide , as well , files containing the time variations of some quantities that may be of interest in the seismic analysis of stellar models .",
    "so , for each stellar parameter set @xmath40 , but only for the ms - lifetime , we built a file whose name is formed , as for hr  diagram ones , with the values of the stellar parameters ( for instance `` m1.00z0.02x0.70-acc.txt '' ) , and whose content in the columns 713 is the following :    * * cutoff frequency * ( in @xmath64hz ) at the photosphere ( column 7 ) : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the sound speed , and @xmath67 the pressure scale height . * * acoustic radius * in seconds ( column 8) : @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the stellar radius at the photosphere .",
    "* * acoustic depth * in seconds of the border of the convective core ( column 10 ) corresponding to the linear relative radius @xmath70 given in column 9 . * * acoustic depth * in seconds of the bottom of the convective envelope ( column 12 ) corresponding to the linear relative radius @xmath71 given in column 11 . * * second he ionization region * : linear relative radius + ( @xmath72 ) in column 12 , and the corresponding acoustic depth @xmath73 in column 13 .    the four first lines , and the columns 16 are the same as in hrd2-files .    in principle , only oscillation modes with frequencies lower than the acoustic cutoff one are trapped in the stellar interior and should be observed . as an indication of the order of magnitude of the expected oscillation frequencies we show in fig .",
    "[ nuacc ] the variation with time of the cutoff frequency for models with masses smaller than 2 .  .",
    "for the chemical composition @xmath19 and @xmath20 there are two types of stellar models depending on whether the boundary conditions at @xmath17 are given by kurucz atmosphere models or by grey ones ( with eddington s law ) .",
    "we showed in fig .",
    "[ pms ] and [ ms ] that the effect on the hrd  location was significant only for @xmath74  k. the effect on the oscillation frequencies may be , however , important even for higher temperatures . as an example we show in fig .",
    "[ deltaek ] the difference between oscillation frequencies for 1.8  models in mid - ms .",
    "the difference in the global parameters for these eddington and kurucz stellar models are @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 .",
    "nevertheless , the density at @xmath17 provided by the two atmosphere models is different enough to affect a significant fraction of the star , leading to an important variation of the oscillation frequencies .",
    "note that for this comparison only the subphotospheric stellar structure was considered in the computation of the oscillation frequencies .",
    "the differences at high frequency will be even larger if the atmosphere structure is included in the calculation .",
    "in order to provide a reference grid of stellar models for the first interpretation of the corot data , we have computed three sets of grey stellar models for 29 different masses from 0.8 to 8  . each grid is computed with a different chemical composition , and altogether they span metallicity values from [ m / h]=-0.45 to + 0.07 ( taking as reference the value of + @xmath78=0.0245 for the sun given by gn93 ) .",
    "there are @xmath79 files containing data on time evolution of global quantities , around 3050 files with the detailed stellar structure ( interior and atmosphere ) , and other 3050 with the corresponding oscillation frequencies for low degree modes ( @xmath80 , 1 , 2 , and 3 ) .",
    "in addition , a set of stellar models with the kurucz s atmospheres as boundary conditions were also computed , for the same values of stellar mass , but for only one chemical composition .",
    "that means additional @xmath812087 files , 87 for the time evolution , and the rest of them for the stellar structure and the corresponding seismic properties .",
