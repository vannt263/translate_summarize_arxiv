    "the effect of local environment on galaxy formation and evolution has been the subject of many recent studies .",
    "observations of local clusters show a strong dependence of stellar age on the local environment ( e.g. smith et al .",
    "2009 ) ; the oldest and most evolved galaxies are found in the central regions whereas the younger actively star - forming galaxies are common on the outskirts , in lower density regions .",
    "studies of higher redshift ( @xmath10 ) clusters have also shown that the stars in massive early - type galaxies must have formed at @xmath9 ( e.g. van dokkum @xmath11 stanford 2003 ) with the galaxies mainly passively evolving since that time ; this is consistent with results from thomas et al .",
    "( 2005 ) who find that massive galaxies in high density environments are expected to have formed the bulk of their stars at much earlier times than their counterparts in the ` field ' .",
    "these observations are in general agreement with models which predict the accelerated formation of galaxies in overdense environments ( e.g. kauffmann 1996 ) .",
    "there is also evidence that active galactic nuclei ( agn ) may be more prevalent in high density regions .",
    "studies of x - ray selected agn show that they are strongly clustered at @xmath12 ( e.g. miyaji et al .",
    "2007 and references therein ) , like the evolved , red galaxies which host them ( coil et al . 2009 ) .",
    "many also appear to reside in group environments ( georgakakis et al .",
    "2008a ) . in the vicinity of clusters , at least at @xmath13 , the x - ray source density appears enhanced ( e.g. cappi et al .",
    "2001 ; martini et al . 2002 ; cappelluti et al . 2005 ; gilmour , best & almaini 2009 ) . spectroscopic and x - ray observations of low redshift clusters by martini et al .",
    "( 2006 ) also show that a substantial number of their cluster galaxies exhibit agn activity and indicate that differing agn identification methods result in significant differences between the measured agn fraction in these environments , and therefore its subsequent relation to that of the field .",
    "as the galaxy number density is much higher in clusters it is reasonable to also expect a higher interaction and merger rate in these regions , and one hypothesis for the triggering of agn activity at high-@xmath14 also involves mergers ( e.g. springel , di matteo & hernquist 2005 ) . in this scenario , we might therefore expect to observe an enhancement in the fraction of galaxies exhibiting signs of agn activity in high-@xmath14 overdense regions when compared to the field  especially as these pre - virialized structures may be the ideal place for efficient mergers of galaxies to result in increased agn activity ( e.g. van breukelen et al . 2009 ) .",
    "also , recent studies of the evolution of the x - ray agn fraction in clusters of galaxies ( for @xmath15 ) show a significant decrease in the observed fraction of cluster galaxies hosting agn over cosmic time ( eastman et al . 2007 ; martini , sivakoff & mulchaey 2009 ) , and so the limited observations of high redshift ( @xmath9 ) overdense regions become increasingly important in determining the situation in the early universe .    studying the precursors of local massive clusters (  protoclusters \" ) at @xmath9",
    "might thus reveal valuable information regarding the earliest ( and most active ) stages of cluster formation , the progenitors of local massive cluster galaxies and how nuclear activity is related to the local environment .",
    "the highest redshift protoclusters have been found by searching for an excess of ly@xmath4 or h@xmath4 emitting galaxies near massive high-@xmath14 radio galaxies ( e.g. venemans et al .",
    "2007 ) , or during the course of spectroscopic surveys for high redshift galaxies ( e.g. steidel et al . 1998 ) .",
    "there are relatively few robustly established overdensities ; the @xmath0 3.09 protocluster in the ssa 22 field is one such structure ( steidel et al .",
    "this field was found to have both an overdensity of lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) and laes .",
    "lehmer et al .",
    "( 2009 ) studied the x - ray emission from the lbgs and laes in the protocluster , and when compared to the field ( at @xmath16 ) they claim suggestive evidence for an enhancement ( for log @xmath17  erg  s@xmath8 ) by a factor @xmath25 and @xmath27 for lbgs and laes , respectively , significant at a combined level of @xmath295  per cent .",
    "the hs 1700 + 64 field contains a similar overdensity of galaxies at @xmath18 ( steidel et al .",

    ", the non - virialized nature of the hs 1700 protocluster would result in a larger population of emission - line agn being observed compared to that of the x - ray selected population ",
    "the results from this study are consistent with this idea .",
    "the results from hs 1700 + 64 can be compared to those of lehmer et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , who examined the x - ray agn content of a higher redshift protocluster at @xmath0 3.09 in the ssa 22 field .",

    "they attribute this to the presence of more actively growing and/or more massive smbhs residing within the protocluster . in the hs 1700 + 64 protocluster",
    "there is evidence for an enhancement of x - ray bx / mds , by a factor of @xmath67 , independently significant at @xmath6899  per cent confidence for agn with @xmath7  erg  s@xmath8 . using the fe analysis , the factor by which the fraction of protocluster x - ray laes is greater than that of the field ( @xmath69 )",
    "is found only to be significant at 87  per cent confidence which , similar to the lae result found for ssa 22 , we do not consider to be indicative of evidence for an enhanced x - ray lae population .",
    "the simplest explanation for any observed excess of agn activity in these protoclusters is that they contain more massive galaxies than the field .",
    "galaxies within the ssa 22 protocluster have inferred stellar masses a factor @xmath70 @xmath71 greater than field galaxies ( lehmer et al .",
    "2009 ) , and are @xmath22 times as large for the hs 1700 + 64 protocluster ( s05 ) .",
    "protocluster galaxies are also found to be significantly more evolved , on average , in terms of their stellar populations . at lower redshifts ,",
    "x - ray emitting agn are known to be hosted by massive , red galaxies ( e.g. nandra et al . 2007",
    "; bundy et al .",
    "hence one explanation for the observed excess of agn activity may simply be that protocluster galaxies have more massive and well developed bulges than field galaxies , and so we therefore observe a higher fraction of protocluster galaxies that exhibit agn activity .    with regard to the x - ray emitting lae population in the hs 1700 + 64 protocluster",
    ", we found that when making a fair comparison to the @xmath0 3.1 ecdf - s field sample , the fraction of laes which harbour an agn with @xmath7  erg  s@xmath8 in hs 1700 ( 2/62 ) is only significant at 87  per cent confidence when compared to that of the field ( 1/212 ) .",
    "we do not consider this result to represent evidence for an enhanced x - ray lae fraction .",
    "we do note however , that this field lae sample is at a much greater redshift than the hs 1700 + 64 protocluster and so may not be representative of the lae population at @xmath0 2.3 .",
    "indeed , recent studies of laes as a function of redshift have revealed significant evolution in the intrinsic properties of these galaxies between @xmath16 and @xmath72 ( nilsson et al .",
    "notably , the lae population at @xmath72 in the nilsson et al .",
    "( 2009 ) study has a larger fraction of massive , old and/or dusty galaxies than at @xmath73 , with the authors concluding that agn are more numerous and also contribute more to the lae population .",
    "recent results from guaita et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , who studied a sample of 250 @xmath74 laes in the ecdf - s , also support a higher agn fraction being present at these redshifts with the authors noting that the number density of x - ray detected agn in their sample is consistent with that of nilsson et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , and that their corresponding x - ray agn fractions are also consistent when restricting their sample to the same ly@xmath4 luminosity limit .",
    "we would therefore expect the @xmath75 x - ray lae field fraction to be larger than at @xmath16 , and consequently would expect the fraction of x - ray laes in hs 1700 + 64 to be even less significant when compared to the field , meaning that our conclusion that the x - ray lae fraction in hs 1700 is not significantly enhanced over the field would still hold .",
    "futhermore , we do not observe any x - ray emitting labs in hs 1700 , unlike the situation in the higher redshift protocluster in ssa 22 ( geach et al . 2009 ) .",
    "if agn activity was indeed exciting the ly@xmath4 emitting population due to the dense environment at @xmath76 , then perhaps one would expect to detect some fraction of the labs in the x - ray data .",
    "we do note , however , that of the sample of 5 labs from geach et al .",
    "( 2009 ) that fulfil our selection criteria , the two x - ray detected objects are at least factor of two brighter in ly@xmath4 luminosity than the labs in our sample , and that the results are consistent within the errors .",
    "to test the idea of mergers / galaxy interactions being the primary triggering mechanism behind the observed agn activity , we used the _ hst_/acs i - band ( f814w ) imaging available in this field ( peter et al .",
    "2007 ) to search for evidence of recent or ongoing merger activity .",
    "it must be borne in mind , however , that at @xmath31 we are probing the rest - frame uv morphology of the galaxies with the f814w filter , not the optical morphology  this means we are sensitive to the brightest star - forming regions of galaxies and not to the overall mass distribution .",

    "md157 , md174 , md69 and md94 .",
    "three of these ( md157 , md69 and md94 ) exhibit disturbed morphologies with multiple nuclei and extended emission .",
    "it is difficult to determine whether these characteristics are an indication of past merger events or galaxy interactions  galaxies at @xmath9 are known to be highly irregular and not as easily classified into hubble types as their local counterparts are . as a result , even obviously disturbed morphologies can not be directly linked to major mergers ( see law et al . 2007 and references therein ) .",
    "quantative morphological comparisons to the non - agn population in these high-@xmath14 protoclusters are needed to determine if the distribution of agn host galaxy morphologies is statistically different to that of the inactive protocluster galaxies and whether these differences , if any , are related to the incidence of mergers / galaxy interactions  this work is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we also note that peter et al .",
    "( 2007 ) did not find any evidence for the morphology of the general bx / md galaxy population being a function of environment in this field  this is unlike the situation at low redshift where morphology is a function of the galaxy number density ( dressler 1980 ) , and where disturbed galaxies are usually indicative of a recent / ongoing merger event .",
    "this also indicates that attributing specific processes ( e.g. galaxy interactions ) to @xmath9 galaxies based on their morphology should only be done in an extremely cautious and quantative manner , not just by the ( apparantly ) disturbed nature of the galaxy s morphology .    finally , in view of these small number statistics and those in the lehmer et al .",

    "<S> we present the results of spectroscopic , narrow  band and x - ray observations of a @xmath0 2.30 protocluster in the field of the qso hs 1700 + 643 . using a sample of bx / md galaxies , which are selected to be at @xmath1 2.22.7 by their rest - frame ultraviolet colours , </S>",
    "<S> we find that there are 5 protocluster agn which have been identified by characteristic emission - lines in their optical / near - ir spectra ; this represents an enhancement over the field significant at @xmath298.5  per cent confidence . using a @xmath2200  ks _ chandra_/acis - i observation of this field </S>",
    "<S> we detect a total of 161 x - ray point sources to a poissonian false - probability limit of @xmath3 and identify 8 of these with bx / md galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> two of these are spectroscopically confirmed protocluster members and are also classified as emission - line agn . when compared to a similarly selected field sample the analysis indicates this is also evidence for an enhancement of x - ray selected bx / md agn over the field , significant at @xmath299  per cent confidence . </S>",
    "<S> deep ly@xmath4 narrow - band imaging reveals that a total of 4/123 ly@xmath4 emitters ( laes ) are found to be associated with x - ray sources , with two of these confirmed protocluster members and one highly likely member . we do not find a significant enhancement of agn activity in this lae sample over that of the field ( result significant at only 87  per cent confidence ) . </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray emitting agn fractions for the bx / md and lae samples are found to be @xmath5 and @xmath6  per cent , respectively , for protocluster agn with @xmath7  erg  s@xmath8 at @xmath0 2.30 . </S>",
    "<S> these findings are similar to results from the @xmath0 3.09 protocluster in the ssa 22 field found by lehmer et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2009 ) , in that both suggest agn activity is favoured in dense environments at @xmath9 .    </S>",
