    "<S> the recently discovered sharp peak in the @xmath0 ratio in relativistic heavy - ion collisions is discussed in the framework of the statistical model . in this model a rapid change is expected as the hadronic gas undergoes a transition from a baryon - dominated to a meson - dominated gas . </S>",
    "<S> the transition occurs at a temperature @xmath1 = 140 mev and baryon chemical potential @xmath2 = 410 mev corresponding to an incident energy of @xmath3 = 8.2 gev . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum in the @xmath4 ratio is well reproduced by the statistical model , but the change in the @xmath0 ratio is much less pronounced than the one observed by the na49 collaboration . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated smooth increase of the @xmath5 ratio and the shape of the @xmath6 and @xmath7 ratios exhibiting maxima at different incident energies is consistent with the presently available experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the measured particle ratios with @xmath8 deviations agree with a hadronic freeze - out scenario . </S>",
    "<S> these deviations seem to occur just in the transition from baryon - dominated to meson - dominated freeze - out .    ,    ,    </S>",
    "<S> ,    the na49 collaboration has recently performed a series of measurements of pb - pb collisions at 20 , 30 , 40 , 80 and 158 agev beam energies @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> when these results are combined with measurements at lower beam energies from the ags  @xcite they reveal an unusually sharp variation with beam energy in the @xmath9 , with @xmath10 , and @xmath0 ratios . </S>",
    "<S> such a strong variation with energy does not occur in pp collisions and therefore indicates a major difference in heavy - ion collisions . </S>",
    "<S> this transition has been referred to in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite as the `` horn '' . </S>",
    "<S> a strong variation with energy of the @xmath9 ratio has been predicted on the basis of arguments put forward in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has also been suggested recently in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite that this is a signal of the special critical point of the qcd phase diagram  @xcite at high baryon density . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we explore another , less spectacular , possibility for the origin of the sharp maximum , namely as being due to the transition from a baryon - dominated to a meson - dominated hadronic gas . </S>",
    "<S> the distinction being based on whether the entropy of the hadronic gas is dominated by baryons or by mesons . for this purpose </S>",
    "<S> we study various quantities along the freeze - out curve  @xcite as a function of @xmath3 .    in the statistical model a steep rise at low energies and a subsequent flattening off leading to a mild maximum in the @xmath0 ratio , </S>",
    "<S> was predicted many years ago  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the sharpness of the observed peak therefore comes as a surprise . on the other hand , a sharp peak in the @xmath9 ratio </S>",
    "<S> was predicted by the statistical model  @xcite and is in good agreement with the data . while the statistical model can not explain the sharpness of the peak in the @xmath0 ratio , there are nevertheless several phenomena , giving rise to the rapid change , which warrant a closer look at the model . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ netbaryon ] we show the net baryon density calculated along the chemical freeze - out curve  @xcite as a function of @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> this curve shows a clear maximum with the net baryon density decreasing rapidly towards higher energies .    to get a better estimate of the statistical parameters in the transition region we show in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ entropy_s ] the entropy density as a function of beam energy following the freeze - out curve given in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the separate contribution of mesons and of baryons to the total entropy is also shown in this figure . </S>",
    "<S> there is a clear change of baryon to meson dominance at @xmath3 = 8.2 gev . above this value </S>",
    "<S> the entropy is carried mainly by mesonic degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> it is remarkable that the entropy density divided by @xmath11 is constant over the entire freeze - out curve , except for the low - energy region corresponding to the sis energy region . </S>",
    "<S> the line denoting the transition from a baryon - dominated to a meson - dominated hadron gas is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ entropy_pd ] . </S>",
    "<S> this line crosses the freeze - out curve at a temperature of @xmath12 mev , when the baryon chemical potential equals @xmath2 = 410 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding invariant energy is @xmath3 = 8.2 gev .    </S>",
    "<S> the strong decrease in the net baryon density seen in fig .  [ netbaryon ] is due to the fact that low energies are characterized by a very low multiplicity of mesons and , correspondingly , a very large baryon - to - meson ratio . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> the baryon chemical potential is also very large . </S>",
    "<S> as the beam energy is increased , meson production increases and the baryon chemical potential decreases . </S>",
    "<S> the number of strange baryons produced in heavy - ion collisions at different collision energies will follow the net baryon density since a large baryon chemical potential will also enhance the number of hyperons .    </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding @xmath0 ratio is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ cankpla ] . </S>",
    "<S> as is well - known  @xcite , the statistical model description leads to a mild maximum in this ratio which does not reproduce the so - called `` horn '' observed by the na49 collaboration  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the observed deviations at the highest sps energy have been interpreted as a lack of full chemical equilibrium in the strangeness sector , leading to a strangeness suppression factor , @xmath13 , deviating from its equilibrium value by about thirty percent . </S>",
    "<S> detailed fits using the statistical model in the region of the `` horn '' show rapid variations in @xmath13 @xcite which do not lend themselves to any interpretation . </S>",
    "<S> there is no corresponding peak in the @xmath5 ratio because the production of @xmath14 is not tied to that of baryons . </S>",
    "<S> as the relative number of baryons decreases with increasing energy , there is no corresponding decrease in the number of @xmath14 as is the case with @xmath15 as these must be balanced by strange baryons .    </S>",
    "<S> it is worth noting that the maxima in the ratios for multi - strange baryons occur at ever higher beam energies . </S>",
    "<S> this can be seen clearly in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ canxiomega ] for the @xmath6 ratio which peaks at a higher value of the beam energy . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio @xmath7 also shows a ( very weak ) maximum , as can be seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ canxiomega ] . </S>",
    "<S> the higher the strangeness content of the baryon , the higher in energy is the maximum . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior is due to a combination of the facts that strangeness has to be balanced , the baryon chemical potential decreases rapidly with energy and the multi - strange baryons have successively higher thresholds . the values are listed in table 1 .    . </S>",
    "<S> maxima in particle ratios as predicted by the statistical model . </S>",
    "<S> [ cols=\"<,^,^ \" , ]     it is to be expected that if these maxima do not all occur at the same temperature , i.e. at the same beam energy , then the case for a phase transition is not very strong . the observed behavior seems to be governed by properties of the hadron gas . </S>",
    "<S> more detailed experimental studies of multi - strange hadrons will allow the verification or disproval of the trends shown in this paper . </S>",
    "<S> it should be clear that the @xmath7 ratio is very broad and shallow and it will be difficult to find a maximum experimentally .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> while the statistical model can not explain the sharpness of the peak in the @xmath0 ratio , its position corresponds precisely to a transition from a baryon - dominated to a meson - dominated hadronic gas . </S>",
    "<S> this transition occurs at a temperature @xmath16 140 mev , a baryon chemical potential @xmath17 410 mev and an energy @xmath18 8.2 gev . in the statistical model this transition leads to a sharp peak in the @xmath9 ratio , and to moderate peaks in the @xmath0 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 ratios . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , these peaks are at different energies in the statistical model . </S>",
    "<S> the statistical model predicts that the maxima in the @xmath9 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 occur at increasing beam energies .    if the change in properties of the above excitation functions were associated with a genuine deconfinement phase transition one would expect these changes to occur at the same beam energy . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that more data are needed to clarify the precise nature of the sharp variation observed by the na49 collaboration . </S>"
