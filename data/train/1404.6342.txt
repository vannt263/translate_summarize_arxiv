    "an idealized electostatically actuated microelectromechanical system ( mems ) consists of a fixed horizontal ground plate held at zero potential above which an elastic plate ( or membrane ) held at potential @xmath0 is suspended , see figure  [ plmems1b ] .",
    "a coulomb force is generated by the potential difference across the device and results in a displacement of the elastic plate , thereby converting electrostatic energy into mechanical energy , see @xcite for a more detailed account and further references .",
    "after a suitable scaling and assuming homogeneity in the transversal horizontal direction ( i.e. no @xmath1-dependence in figure  [ plmems1b ] ) , the ground plate is assumed to be located at @xmath2 and the plate displacement @xmath3 evolves according to @xmath4 for @xmath5 and @xmath6 with clamped boundary conditions @xmath7 and initial conditions @xmath8 in , @xmath9 measures the ratio of inertial and damping forces which are given by the second and first order time derivatives , respectively , while @xmath10 with and @xmath11 with @xmath12 account for bending and stretching of the elastic plate , respectively .",
    "the right hand side of reflects the electrostatic forces exerted on the elastic plate , where the parameter @xmath13 is proportional to the square of the voltage difference between the two components , and the parameter @xmath14 denotes the aspect ratio of the device ( that is , the ratio height / length ) .",
    "the boundary conditions describe an elastic plate being clamped at its fixed boundary .",
    "finally , the electrostatic potential @xmath15 satisfies a rescaled laplace equation in the time - varying region @xmath16 between the ground plate and the elastic plate which reads @xmath17 note that , when @xmath18 , equation   is a hyperbolic nonlocal semilinear fourth - order equation for the plate displacement @xmath19 , which is coupled to the second - order elliptic equation in the moving domain @xmath20 for the electrostatic potential @xmath21 .",
    "if damping effects dominate over inertia effects one may set @xmath22 in - and thus obtains a parabolic equation for @xmath19 .",
    "a noteworthy feature of the above model is that it is only meaningful as long as the elastic plate does not touch down on the ground plate , that is , the deflection @xmath19 satisfies @xmath23 . from a physical point of view",
    "it is expected that above a certain critical threshold of @xmath24 , the elastic plate `` pulls in '' and smashes down on the ground plate .",

    ", the mathematical investigation aims at showing that the parameter @xmath24 indeed governs the dynamics of - , in particular the touchdown behavior and the closely related issues of global well - posedness and existence of steady states .",
    "more precisely , above a certain threshold value of @xmath24 it is conjectured that solutions to - cease to exist globally in time and that there are no steady - states , while for @xmath24 below this critical value , solutions are global and there are at least two steady states . moreover , if solutions do not exist globally , then the elastic plate pulls in at some finite time @xmath32 , i.e. , @xmath33 in the special situation of the so - called _ small aspect ratio model _ which corresponds to setting in - , it turns out that the electrostatic potential @xmath21 is explicitly given by @xmath34 in @xmath20 and the full system - reduces to a singular evolution equation only involving  @xmath19 . in this case , a quite complete characterization of the expected dynamics  confirming almost all of these conjectures  is obtained in @xcite , see also @xcite for further information as well as @xcite and the references therein for the small aspect ratio model in general .",
    "in contrast , due to the present coupling , the free boundary problem with @xmath14 turns out to be even more involved and the literature is far more sparse in this case .",
    "a series of recent papers , however , addresses these questions for the free boundary problem when @xmath35 : see @xcite for steady - state solutions , @xcite for the corresponding parabolic problem , and @xcite for a quasilinear version thereof .",

    "in particular , precise information on the gradient trace of the potential  @xmath41 on the elastic plate is required as a function of @xmath19 . for this",

    "an additional difficulty stems from the fact that the time regularity of @xmath118 as stated in part ( i ) of theorem  [ plt11 ] is not sufficient for a direct computation and one rather has to use an approximation argument .    to prove then the significant criterion for global existence from part  ( ii ) of theorem  [ plt11 ]",
