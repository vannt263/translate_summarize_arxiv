    "a variety of experiments with solar , atmospheric , reactor and accelerator neutrinos , spanning energies from mev up to tens of gev , demonstrated unambiguously that neutrinos change from one flavour to another during propagation .",
    "neutrino oscillations imply non - zero neutrino masses , and that the masses of the three neutrino states are different . in the standard @xmath0-neutrino scheme , the mixing matrix relating the neutrino flavour eigenstates ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath3 ) to the mass eigenstates ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) is parameterised in terms of three mixing angles @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and a cp - violating phase @xmath10 .",
    "oscillation experiments are mostly sensitive to mass - squared differences @xmath11 .",
    "global fits of available data form a coherent picture and provide the values of these oscillation parameters with reasonable precision @xcite .",
    "an open question is the so - called neutrino mass hierarchy ( nmh ) .",
    "it refers to the ordering of the neutrino mass eigenstates , which is either @xmath12 ( normal hierarchy , nh ) or @xmath13 ( inverted hierarchy , ih ) .",
    "the ordering of the first two closely spaced mass eigenstates , @xmath14 , is known from solar neutrino physics .",
    "further yet unknown neutrino properties are : the value of @xmath10 , the absolute masses , the dirac / majorana nature of neutrinos . knowing the nmh is important for constraining the models that seek to explain the origin of mass in the leptonic sector and will allow to optimise the information obtained from other neutrino experiments ( targeting @xmath10 , absolute neutrino masses and neutrinoless double - beta decays ) .",
    "in addition , the nmh has a significant impact on the measurement precision of the oscillation parameters .",
    "the nmh can be determined by measuring the energy and zenith angle dependent oscillation pattern of few - gev atmospheric neutrinos that have traversed the earth towards the detector @xcite . due to matter - induced modifications on the oscillation probabilities in conjunction with different cross - sections and atmospheric neutrino fluxes for neutrinos and antineutrinos , the expected event rates of neutrinos in the energy regime of @xmath0@xmath1gev are different for nh and ih .",
    "next - generation experiments , such as km3net / orca @xcite , pingu @xcite and hyper - kamiokande @xcite , are planned to perform this measurement with megaton - scale water / ice - based cherenkov detectors .    in the following ,",
    "the prospects for measuring the neutrino mass hierarchy with orca ( oscillation research with cosmics in the abyss ) are presented , and the potential to improve the measurement precision on @xmath9 and @xmath15 is discussed .",
    "this contribution is mainly based on the ` letter of intent for km3net 2.0 ' @xcite .",
    "the km3net detector design builds on the experience of the successful deployment and operation of the antares detector @xcite , which has demonstrated the feasibility of measuring neutrinos with a large - volume cherenkov detector in the deep sea .",
    "the detection principle is that of a 3-dimensional array of photosensors that register the cherenkov light induced by charged particles produced in a neutrino - induced interaction . from the arrival time of the cherenkov photons ( nanosecond precision ) and",
    "the position of the sensors ( @xmath1610 cm precision ) , the energy and direction of the incoming neutrino , as well as other parameters of the neutrino interaction , can be reconstructed .",
    "a key km3net technology is the digital optical module ( dom ) , a pressure - resistant glass sphere housing 31 3-inch pmts and their associated electronics .",
    "this multi - pmt design offers several improvements compared to traditional optical modules hosting only a single large pmt ( for example in antares ) , most notably : larger photocathode area , wider field of view , directional information and dynamic range .",
    "the doms are arranged in strings held vertically by a buoy and anchored to the seabed .",
    "figure  [ fig : dom_string ] shows a dom and a detection string .         in its current design",
    ", the orca detector will comprise @xmath17 such detection strings .",
    "each string comprises @xmath18 doms with a vertical spacing of about @xmath19 m .",
    "the horizontal spacing between adjacent strings is roughly @xmath1 m .",
    "the instrumented mass is about @xmath20mton of seawater .",
    "this detector configuration is the outcome of a optimisation study using the nmh sensitivity as figure of merit .",
    "the proposed detector could be built in three years , with an investment budget of about @xmath21m  @xcite .",
    "the orca detector will be deployed at the french km3net site at a depth of @xmath22 m .",
    "the site is about @xmath23 km offshore from toulon and about @xmath24 km west of the operating antares detector .",
    "the construction of the infrastructure has already started .",
    "the first main electro - optical cable and the first junction box , needed to connect the detection strings , have been successfully deployed and connected .",
    "the first detection string is foreseen to be deployed in early 2017 .",
    "an array comprising 7 detection strings is funded and expected to be concluded and operational by the end of 2017 .",
    "it will serve to demonstrate the feasibility of the measurement and to validate and optimise the detector design . the full - size orca detector comprising @xmath17 detection strings could be operational towards 2020 .    within km3net ,",
    "the same technology is employed also for the search for high - energy astrophysical neutrino sources with the arca detector @xcite , which will be deployed offshore from sicily , italy .",
    "the main difference between both detector designs is the density of photosensors , which is optimised for the study of neutrinos in the few - gev ( orca ) and tev - pev ( arca ) energy ranges .",
    "the key parameters for the nmh determination are the effective mass of the detector and the experimental resolutions for the energy @xmath25 and zenith angle @xmath26 of the incoming neutrino .",
    "detailed monte carlo simulations have been performed using genie@xcite for simulating neutrino interactions and geant - based simulation packages @xcite for particle propagation and cherenkov photon generation .",
    "optical background from @xmath27k decays in the seawater as well as the background from downgoing atmospheric muons is taken into account .",
    "further details are given in @xcite .",
    "two distinct event topologies are considered : tracks and showers .",
    "showers are initiated by energetic electrons and hadrons emerging from the neutrino interaction , and develop over relatively short distances .",
    "muons produce elongated tracks in the detector .",
    "therefore , track - like events are induced by @xmath28 charged - current ( cc ) interactions , as well as @xmath29  cc interactions with muonic tau decays .",
    "all other neutrino - induced events are called shower - like , i.e. @xmath30  cc events , @xmath31 neutral - current events and @xmath29  cc events with non - muonic @xmath32 decays .",
    "dedicated reconstruction strategies for track - like and shower - like events , as well as an event topology classification algorithm , have been developed and are described in @xcite .",
    "the energy resolution is gaussian - like with @xmath33% .",
    "the median zenith angle resolution is about @xmath34 for @xmath30  cc and @xmath28  cc events with @xmath35gev . due to the long scattering length of light in deep - sea water ,",
    "the reconstructions are able to find the lepton ( @xmath36 ) in @xmath37  cc events and are therefore able to gain access to the interaction inelasticity @xmath38 .",
    "this allows a statistical separation of @xmath39 and @xmath40 interactions to further add to the nmh sensitivity @xcite .",
    "this possibility has not yet been exploited in the estimated nmh sensitivity presented below .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the energy resolution is dominated by intrinsic light yield fluctuations in the hadronic shower and the direction resolution is limited by the kinematic scattering angle between the outgoing lepton and the incoming neutrino .",
    "the purity of the event topology classification is about 90% ( 70% ) for @xmath30  cc ( @xmath28  cc ) events with @xmath35gev .",
    "the same event classification algorithm also rejects downgoing atmospheric muons that are mis - reconstructed as upgoing .",
    "a contamination of less than a few percent of atmospheric muons in the final sample of upgoing neutrino events is achieved .",
    "effvol_eleccc_diffspacings_nop ( 37,60 ) * km3net *    the effective mass of the detector is about @xmath20mton , being reached for @xmath30  cc and @xmath28  cc with energies above @xmath35gev , while 50% efficient at @xmath41gev .",
    "figure  [ fig : effmass_nue_diff_vspacings ] shows the effective volume for @xmath30  cc events for detector configurations with different vertical spacings between the doms , i.e.  different photosensor densities . in the @xmath42gev range , which is most relevant for the nmh determination ,",
    "the detector configuration with @xmath19 m vertical spacing provides the largest effective mass and therefore largest available event statistics .",
    "this detector configuration was also found to provide the best nmh sensitivity @xcite .",
    "it will provide data samples of about 50,000 reconstructed upgoing neutrinos per year .",
    "building on the expected detector performance , a significance analysis is performed by generating a large number of pseudo - experiments ( pes ) with event distributions in the reconstructed @xmath25@xmath26 plane . for each",
    "pe , a true hierarchy and a set of oscillation parameters is assumed .",
    "each pe is analysed by performing a maximum likelihood fit with the oscillation parameters as free parameters and assuming either nh or ih .",
    "the likelihood ratio resulting from these fits is used to quantify the separability between both hierarchies .",
    "systematic uncertainties from the neutrinos fluxes , their cross sections as well as the detector response are parameterised as overall normalisation , energy scale , @xmath40/@xmath39 skew , @xmath43/@xmath44 skew and nc / cc skew and are incorporated as nuisance parameters .",
    "it is found that none of these effects compromise substantially the ability of orca to determine the nmh @xcite .     and assuming @xmath45 ( solid ) or @xmath46 ( dashed ) .",
    "three years of data taking with the full - size orca detector are assumed.,width=302 ]    figure  [ fig : nmh_significance ] shows the median significance of orca to exclude the wrong hierarchy hypothesis after three years of data taking as a function of the true value of @xmath9 and assuming no cp - violation , i.e. @xmath10 equals @xmath47 or @xmath48 . for the experimentally allowed range of @xmath9 and assuming @xmath49 , the nmh can be measured with about @xmath50 after three years of operation .",
    "orca is moderately sensitive to the cp - phase , the significance being reduced by at most @xmath51 if @xmath52 is realised in nature .",
    "the significance increases dramatically in case of nh and @xmath53 , reaching up to about @xmath54 in three years of operation .",
    "besides the nmh determination , orca can also improve the uncertainties on @xmath15 and @xmath9 .",
    "both parameters are determined without the need for constrains from global data in conjunction with the nmh .",
    "figure  [ fig : osci_para ] shows the expected measurement precision after three years and compares it with current results of other experiments and their predicted performances in 2020 .",
    "the precision of orca is comparable or better , and is obtained with different systematic uncertainties . in particular , orca can determine the ` octant ' of @xmath9 ( above or below @xmath55 ) for a wide range of the allowed parameter range .     and",
    "@xmath9 after three years of data taking with orca for three assumed test cases ( red ) .",
    "the current results from ( back ) and t2k ( blue solid ) are indicated , as well as the predicted performance of no@xmath39a ( magenta ) and t2k ( blue dashed ) in 2020 .",
    "all contours are at @xmath56 for nh.,width=283 ]    additional science topics of orca include : testing the unitary of the neutrino mixing matrix by studying @xmath29 appearance ; indirect searches for sterile neutrinos , non - standard interactions and other exotic physics ; indirect searches for dark matter ; testing the chemical composition of the earth s core ( earth tomography ) ; and low - energy neutrino astrophysics .",
    "preliminary performance expectations are briefly summarised in @xcite .",
    "the km3net research infrastructure will also house instrumentation for earth and sea sciences , such as marine biology , oceanography and geophysics .",
    "possible future options could be a long - baseline neutrino beam targeted to orca @xcite , and a significantly denser detector instrumentation lowering the detection threshold to measure the cp - phase @xmath10 with atmospheric neutrinos @xcite .",
    "with orca , a @xmath20mton deep - sea cherenkov detector optimised for the detection of few - gev neutrinos , the km3net collaboration aims to perform a high - statistics measurement of the zenith angle and energy dependent event rates of atmospheric neutrinos that have traversed the earth . the oscillated neutrino flux in the energy range @xmath0@xmath1gev holds the key to determine the neutrino mass hierarchy .",
    "orca is expected to achieve a @xmath0@xmath54 sensitivity to the neutrino mass hierarchy in three years of data taking .",
    "simultaneously , orca will measure @xmath15 and @xmath9 with competitive precision , and has a rich additional science program .    in the first construction phase of orca",
    ", a 7-string demonstrator is expected to be concluded and operational by the end of 2017 .",
