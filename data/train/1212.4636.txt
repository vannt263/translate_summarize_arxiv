    "however , this theory seems to be insufficient to explain the temperature - pressure phase diagram of cecu@xmath4ge@xmath4 or cecu@xmath4si@xmath4 , where a superconducting dome with enhanced transition temperature is located far away from the antiferromagnetic critical point . since this discovery",
    ", these compounds have drawn much attention both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "it has been argued that this phenomenon is related to the critical valence fluctuations of ce ions,@xcite that is , to the existence of a second qcp .",
    "the simplest model of heavy - fermion compounds is the periodic anderson model ( pam).@xcite it is known , however , that the mixed - valence regime appears always in this model as a smooth crossover , and valence fluctuations do not become critical for any choice of the parameters .",
    "a local coulomb interaction between the conduction and localized electrons is needed for the appearance of a sharp transition and critical valence fluctuations.@xcite the hamiltonian of this extended periodic anderson model can be written using standard notations in the following form : @xmath5 after onishi and miyake s pioneering work,@xcite recently , this model has been investigated by several modern techniques , including density matrix renormalization group,@xcite dynamical mean field,@xcite variational calculations,@xcite projector based renormalization approach@xcite , and fluctuation exchange approximation.@xcite it has been found that a first - order valence transition and a qcp may appear due to @xmath2 .",

    "we investigate how the qcp and the @xmath7 phase diagram depend on the parameters of the model in the half - filled case . in our previous paper@xcite",
    "we have shown that the gutzwiller s variational method gives reliable results concerning the valence , therefore it is worth studying the valence transition by this method .",
    "it is worth noting that a first - order transition from mott insulator to kondo insulator has been found@xcite in a model with a more general hamiltonian , too , including hund s coupling and interaction between @xmath0-electrons .",
    "we do not consider the hund s coupling here since the appearance of critical valence fluctuations was attributed to the direct coulomb interaction between @xmath0- and @xmath1-electrons.@xcite the exchange coupling between them probably plays a minor role in this respect .",
