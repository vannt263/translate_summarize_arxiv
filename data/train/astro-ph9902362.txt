    "general outflows and collimated jets are thought to be intimately related to infall and protostellar accretion .",
    "recent observations ( donati et al .",
    "@xcite , guenther & emerson @xcite ) suggest the relevance of magnetic fields to star formation , first suggested by mestel & spitzer ( @xcite ) .",
    "tomisaka ( @xcite ) has studied numerically the dynamical collapse of magnetized molecular cloud cores from the runaway cloud collapse phase to the central point mass accretion phase .",
    "he finds that the evolution of the cloud contracting under its self - gravity is well expressed by a self - similar solution",
    ". moreover inflow - outflow circulation appears as a natural consequence of the initial configuration .",
    "his results support the magnetized self - similar models as recently presented by fiege and henriksen ( @xcite a , b , hereafter fh1 , fh2 ) following henriksen ( @xcite , @xcite ) , and henriksen and valls - gabaud ( @xcite , hereafter hv ) . in those models ,",
    "the self - similar gravitationally driven convective circulation in a heated quadrupolar protostar envelope is solved rigorously .",
    "moreover recent observations ( greaves & holland @xcite ) of the polarized dust emission from six star - forming cloud cores have revealed , for the first time , some very large twists in the magnetic field .",
    "this is consistent with fh1 and hv where circumstellar magnetic fields follow large - scale streamlines .",
    "this remains very nearly the case in the present model .",
    "the self - similar models regard the molecular outflow as a natural consequence of the circulation established by the collapse of the pre - stellar cloud . _",
    "the models describe an outflow velocity that increases toward the axis of rotation , a convective pattern of infall / outflow , self - consistent axial collimating magnetic fields and rotation , and `` cored apple '' type distributions of circum - protostellar gas _",
    "( andre et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    such models may imply a natural connection between the fast ionized jets seen near the polar axis of the wind , and the slower and less - collimated molecular outflows that surround them .",
    "however velocities obtained by fh1 and hv are smaller than some observed velocities ( e.g. ehv outflow ( @xmath9 ) , bachiller et al .",
    "@xcite ) unless the solution is pushed very close to the central mass where the limiting speed is about the escape speed ( and the jet speed ) of a few hundred @xmath10 . but",
    "this is precisely the region where the inner boundary layer may be dominant and the assumptions of this type of model are liable to break down .",
    "moreover the luminosity needed for radiative heating in fh1 is too large in order to drive high - velocity outflows if only dust opacity is used . in the present work",
    "we show that _ the poynting flux increases both the velocity and collimation of the modeled outflows by helping to transport mass and energy from the equatorial regions_. this is much as has been argued for some time by other authors ( e.g. pudritz and norman @xcite , ouyed and pudritz @xcite ) , but our models are globally consistent in space .",
    "self - similar models can not of course be globally consistent in time even if they are not stationary ( we have found such models and will report them elsewhere ) , since they are ignorant of initial conditions . and",
    "in fact they must also be ` intermediate ' in space since there are inevitably small regions near the equator , the axis and at the centre which are excluded from the domain of self - similarity .",
    "thus , we derive globally self - consistent models of bipolar outflows and infall accretion , but specifically exclude the regions dominated by the disc , jet , and protostar .",
    "qualitatively we may understand the quadrupolar global circulation in the following fashion .",
    "as material falls towards the central object , it is gradually slowed down by increasing radial pressure gradients due to the rising temperature , density , and magnetic field encountered by material near the central object .",
    "this pressure barrier , with the help of centrifugal forces , deflects and accelerates much of the infalling matter into an outflow along the axis of symmetry .",
    "the outflow velocity is naturally the highest near the axis of rotation since the pressure gradients are strongest there . mathematically the quadrupolar model can be seen as a form of instability of the spherical bondi accretion flow , wherein rotation , magnetic fields and anisotropic heating transform a central nodal singularity into a saddle point singularity .",
    "the pressure gradients also act to collimate the flow , forming consistently the now traditional de laval nozzle ( e.g. blandford and rees @xcite , k \" onigl @xcite ) .",
    "we find however that the most convincing flows are everywhere super - alfvnic , in agreement with fh1 , but the nozzle may still be critical in terms of the fast magnetosonic speed as discussed in fh1 and below .",
    "we note that one can expect conical shocks near the rotational axis , which would seem to be necessary to explain the shocked molecular hydrogen emission often observed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in  2 we introduce the model and its approximations , and discuss their consequences ; numerical solutions are presented in  3 for virial - isothermal and radiative models describing outflows from low and high mass protostars . in ",
    "4 we study the ensuing synthetic radio maps ; this section is followed by discussions of the results in  5 , and conclusions are presented in  6 .",
    "the main difference between hydrodynamic and mhd outflows is the low asymptotic mach number in the mhd case . for protostellar outflows ,",
    "the magnetosonic speed is about @xmath11 at @xmath12 au and therefore far exceeds the sonic speed .",
    "it is not a priori obvious that the internal alfvnic mach number of the jet or outflow is small .",
    "however most of our models are super - alfvnic everywhere .",
    "the plasma is supposed to be perfectly conducting and therefore the flow is governed by the basic equations of ideal mhd without taking into account resistivity or ambipolar diffusion . in order to make the system tractable we assume axisymmetric flow so that @xmath13 and all flow variables are functions only of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "kudoh and shibata ( @xcite ) have performed time dependent one - dimensional ( 1.5-dimensional ) magnetohydrodynamic numerical simulations of astrophysical jets that are magnetically driven from keplerian discs .",
    "they have found that the jets , which are ejected from the disc , have the same properties as the steady magnetically driven jets they had found before ( kudoh & shibata @xcite ) .",
    "their numerical results suggest that a steady model , as we are assuming in the present work ( i.e. @xmath14 ) , is a good first approximation to the time - dependent problem on time - scales short compared to that required to dissipate the circumstellar material .",
    "time independence will be relaxed in future work .",
    "accretion discs near protostars are probably heavily convective and therefore prone to dynamo action ( brandenburg et al .",
    "@xcite , fh1 ) .",
    "since the ensuing magnetic fields are loaded with disc plasma , currents are allowed to circulate between the disc surface and the wind region above the disc .",
    "for rapidly rotating discs , this dynamical system may evolve naturally into a quadrupolar structure ( camenzind @xcite , khanna and camenzind @xcite ) .",
    "the strong differential rotation of accretion discs is responsible for the excitation of quadrupolar modes in discs .",
    "consequently , in the present model , magnetic field and streamlines are required to be quadrupolar in the poloidal plane .",
    "a moderate amount of heating supplied near the turning point allows the outflow to possess finite velocities at infinity .",
    "these considerations have led us to use the set of equations of steady , axisymmetric , ideal mhd and to seek solutions with a quadrupolar geometry .",
    "even though the poloidal components of the magnetic and velocity fields have to be parallel , the toroidal components need not share the same constant of proportionality ( henriksen @xcite ) .",
    "this permits a poloidal conservative electric field to exist in the inertial frame , and so admits steady poynting flux driving .",
    "one needs then to introduce an electric potential function and an azimuthal magnetic field independent of the azimuthal velocity .",
    "this point is the major improvement of the model with respect to fh1 . in the radiative case ,",
    "the equations describing diffusive radiative transfer ( to zero order in @xmath15 ) and a kramers - type law for the rosseland opacity are added as in fh1 .",
    "we also neglect the self - gravity of the protostellar material by assuming that the gravitational field is dominated by the central mass that is assumed to be an external fixed parameter in our model .",
    "henceforth the model only applies to a state where the protostellar core is already formed .",
    "it is unlikely that this model can be extended to include the optical jets since these must originate very near to the central object where the model may not apply in its steady form .",
    "nevertheless , the inclusion of a jet model in the axial region , such as given by lery et al.(@xcite , @xcite ) , could remedy this lack in order to make a more global model for protostellar objects .",
    "our model is developed within the context of power law self - similar models as developed by henriksen ( @xcite ) , and in hv and fh1 .",
    "a model with such symmetry was already used by bardeen & berger ( @xcite ) for galactic winds , although the present development has been independent .",
    "parallel developments have been largely occupied with the study of winds from an established accretion disc ( blandford & payne @xcite , konigl @xcite , ferreira & pelletier @xcite , rosso & pelletier @xcite , ferreira @xcite , contopoulos & lovelace @xcite , contopoulos @xcite , sauty & tsinganos @xcite , tsinganos et al .",
    "@xcite , vlahakis & tsinganos @xcite ) .",
    "our use of this model in order to study inflow and outflow as part of the global circulation dynamics around protostars seems unique .",
    "the form used corresponds to an example of ` incomplete self - similarity ' in the classification of barenblatt ( @xcite ) , but fits into the general scheme of self - similarity advocated by carter and henriksen ( @xcite ) with @xmath0 as the direction of the lie self - similar motion .",
    "we work in spherical polar coordinates @xmath16 centered on the point mass @xmath17 and having the polar axis directed along the mean angular momentum of the surrounding material .",
    "the self - similar symmetry is identical to that used in fh1 except that two quantities @xmath18 and @xmath19 defined such that @xmath20 ( where @xmath21 indicates the appropriate component ) replace @xmath22 in fh1 .",
    "the power laws of the self - similar symmetry are determined , up to a single parameter @xmath5 , if we assume that the local gravitational field is dominated by a fixed central mass . in terms of a fiducial radial distance , @xmath23",
    ", the self - similar symmetry is sought as a function of two scale invariants , @xmath24 and @xmath1 , in a separated power - law form .",
    "the equations of radiative mhd require the following radial scaling relations for the variables : @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31 in these equations the microscopic constants are represented by @xmath32 for boltzmann s constant , @xmath33 for the mean atomic weight , @xmath34 for the mass of the hydrogen atom . the self - similar index @xmath5 is imposed as a parameter of the solution , but as in fh1 it is constrained to lie in the range @xmath35 . in the last equation , the index @xmath36 is a measure of the loss ( if negative ) or gain in radiation energy as a function of radial distance .",
    "whenever we take account of radiative diffusion explicitly , as well as for the definition of the luminosity , we will use the same formulation as in fh1 .",
    "the simplest approach however is to assume that the temperature is some fraction of the ` virialized ' value . that is , according to relation ( [ self2 ] ) , that @xmath8 takes some constant value @xmath37 . by using the first law and assuming an ideal gas ( so that with the above relations for @xmath38 and @xmath39 we have @xmath40 ) this assumption implies that on a sphere the specific entropy @xmath41 varies according to @xmath42 consequently we are explicitly adding or subtracting heat from the system on a spherical surface according to the sign of @xmath43 . in our models",
    "this normally increases towards the rotational axis .",
    "thus , at least implicitly , we _ always _ employ some form of heat transfer , presumably radiative , to the gas over the poles relative to the equatorial material .",
    "the same procedure for variations in the radial direction yields @xmath44 \\left(\\frac{r_o}{r}\\right)^2 \\frac{dr}{r_o}. \\label{radentropy}\\ ] ] energy is therefore lost to the material with increasing radius provided that the quantity in the square bracket is positive .",
    "this requires @xmath45 , which is true for reasonable ratios of specific heats throughout our permitted range of @xmath5 .",
    "in order for radiative heating to be adequate we must have @xmath46 sufficiently large , where @xmath47 is the net radiative flux through a mass element .",
    "we note that because of the dependence on @xmath47 , this is not the same as requiring an optical depth of order unity . nevertheless in order for the radiative transfer by diffusion to be plausible",
    ", this latter condition must also be satisfied .",
    "in either case the issue depends on the nature of the opacity @xmath48 .",
    "we follow fh1 in supposing that this is predominantly a dust opacity ( at least at some distance from the ` star ' ) which is taken in kramer s form @xmath49 a fit to a dust model in fh1 yields @xmath50 , and @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "we can calculate the mean optical depth between an inner radius @xmath53 and the fiducial radius @xmath23 , namely @xmath54 , using this opacity and the self - similar scaling relations .",
    "we find @xmath55 , \\label{optdepth}\\ ] ] where we have defined the fiducial radius as @xmath56^{1/4 } m^{3/4 } , \\label{rfid}\\ ] ] which is numerically @xmath57 thus _ we obtain a fiducial radius that is characteristic of the bipolar outflow sources _ and is a convenient unit for our discussions . a similar scale ( to within a factor 5 )",
    "was previously deduced in henriksen ( @xcite ) based on the source luminosity and fundamental constants ( including the radiation constant ) .",
    "we note that the external opacity from @xmath58 to @xmath23 is given simply by @xmath59 and the ` photosphere ' of the cloud is therefore found where @xmath60 .    the corresponding temperature at the fiducial radius is given by @xmath61 we observe that if we identify our radiative fiducial scale @xmath23 with an empirical scale @xmath62 from @xmath63 ( richer et al .",
    "@xcite ) , we can infer a relation between the mean density parameter @xmath64 and the central mass in the form @xmath65 _ this is a useful way to relate the key model parameter @xmath66 to the physical mass and luminosity_. we note however that the optical depth is not likely to approach unity for reasonable temperatures , except for exceptionally massive objects .",
    "but this does not prevent radiative heating from playing an important dynamical role near the protostar .",
    "in fact using @xmath23 , as above , and the definition of radiation field @xmath47 ( eq .",
    "[ selfrad ] ) , the local energy flow can be expressed by @xmath67 the radiative force per unit mass is given by @xmath68 which must be less than the eddington limit of @xmath69 , for consistency .",
    "these are helpful considerations for our radiative models below that always verify this condition a posteriori .",
    "we use the self - similar forms in the usual set of ideal mhd equations together with the radiative diffusion equation when applicable .",
    "the corresponding system of equations is reported in appendix a , and the ensuing first integrals in appendix b. as noted above , in the present model , there is no constraint requiring parallelism between velocity and magnetic field as used in fh1 .",
    "this allows us to discern clearly the effects of a non - zero poynting flux .",
    "the self - similar variable directly related to magnetic field @xmath22 has two components that are not equal in the present model .",
    "these quantities are either projected in the poloidal plane or correspond to the toroidal components and are respectively defined by @xmath70 consequently the system deals with two different components of the alfvnic mach number @xmath71 and @xmath72 defined by : @xmath73    in this model , since @xmath0 and @xmath74 respectively correspond to the directions of self - similarity and axisymmetry , only waves that propagate along @xmath1 in the poloidal plane can preserve these two symmetries .",
    "therefore the relevant alfvn mode propagates in the direction @xmath1 in the poloidal plane with a phase velocity : @xmath75 moreover we define an alfvnic point where the total poloidal flow velocity is equal to this value in magnitude and direction ( i.e. @xmath76 ) , which by ( [ y ] ) is equivalent to : @xmath77 one can then define a critical scaled density corresponding to the alfvnic scaled density @xmath78 the flow is super - alfvnic if the density @xmath66 is larger than the critical alfvn density @xmath79 .",
    "moreover , the compressible slow and fast mhd waves propagate in a poloidal direction @xmath1 with phase velocities that satisfy the quartic ( sauty and tsinganos @xcite ) @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the isothermal sound speed .",
    "the condition that @xmath82 be equal to one of these wave speeds ( where we expect a singular point in the family of solutions ) can be expressed in terms of self - similar variables as : @xmath83 and in physical units ( cf fh1 ) : @xmath84 equation ( [ dispersion ] ) shows that whenever @xmath85 the slow and fast speeds become @xmath86 and @xmath87 respectively .",
    "thus a super - alfvnic flow as defined above can only encounter the fast speed and then only where @xmath88 . in a region where the sound speed dominates ,",
    "the fast and slow speeds become @xmath89 and @xmath90 respectively .",
    "either the sound speed or the alfvn speed is dominant according as @xmath8 is larger or smaller than @xmath91 .",
    "as in henriksen ( @xcite ) we can consider the energy balance in these models .",
    "a convenient form for the energy equation is @xmath92 where the poynting flux vector is @xmath93 and @xmath94 . in self - similar variables",
    "the poynting flux becomes @xmath95 where the self - similar poynting flux @xmath96 can be defined in terms of the other variables as : @xmath97 the energy equation becomes @xmath98   + ( 2\\alpha-{\\frac{3}{2}})u_r p   \\nonumber\\\\   & =   -\\frac{1}{\\sin{\\theta } }   \\frac{d}{d\\theta}\\left[\\sin{\\theta}(\\mu u_\\theta(\\frac{\\vec{u}^2}{2}-1)+   \\sigma_\\theta)\\right ] -\\frac{u_\\theta}{\\sin{\\theta } } \\frac{dp}{d\\theta}.   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this equation is generally true for our models but it does not provide an independent integral for non - zero pressure .",
    "this we treat in the next sub - section .      in the zero pressure limit",
    "one can use the self - similar energy equation together with @xmath99 and @xmath100 on a stream line to write a bernoulli integral @xmath101=b,\\ ] ] where @xmath102 is the bernoulli constant on each stream line . in view of eq .",
    "[ stream1 ] we can write this as @xmath103 , \\label{bernoulli}\\ ] ] where the second term evidently describes the poynting driving ( magnetic energy term ) and the first term gives the kinetic and gravitational energies .",
    "hence if @xmath104 , we require the expression contained in brackets on the rhs of this last equation to tend towards infinity both at the equator and on the polar axis since @xmath105 in these limits .",
    "this is an improbable outer boundary condition although physically realizable at some large but finite radius ( which might be a function of angle and so trace out an excluded region for the self - similar solution ) .",
    "it does permit the exchange between say a large driving poynting term near the equator and a large kinetic energy term near the axis , but the source of the ` free ' magnetic energy is left undetermined .",
    "we turn to the special case @xmath106 , which requires this same factor to be zero everywhere on a streamline . in order that there be an exchange between the kinetic term and the poynting term in the sum we must have either @xmath107 and @xmath108 or the reverse of both inequalities . in the first case",
    "we do not produce velocities greater than the escape velocity anywhere , while in the second case we require @xmath109 everywhere on the streamline which also seems improbable .",
    "we are left then with the first possibility , which includes the case where each term vanishes separately on the boundaries .",
    "this suggests that starting from a physically likely free - fall boundary condition , @xmath110 is less than or equal to the escape velocity on every stream line in the absence of pressure , becoming equal again to the escape velocity at large distances .    thus without pressure effects one is unable to produce net outflows at infinity without appealing to a poynting flux from an excluded equatorial region .",
    "however one does thus deflect and collimate the material ( magnetically and centrifugally ) in a lossless way , and so all energy added near the star may appear in the outflow at infinity rather than be lost to work against gravity .",
    "the fact that there is no net gain of kinetic energy from the magnetic field energy on a stream line is peculiar to the case with @xmath106 .",
    "it is due to the fact that energy that is first gained by the magnetic field at the expense of gravity and rotation during infall is subsequently returned as gravitational potential energy and kinetic energy during the outflow . with @xmath104",
    ", there may be a source of poynting flux in the excluded region ( see e.g. also henriksen ( @xcite ) .",
    "the numerical solutions in this work are obtained by initiating the integrations of the system of six equations from a chosen angle between the axis ( @xmath111 ) and the equator ( @xmath112 ) .",
    "starting values are varied until the boundary conditions are met .",
    "solutions can not strictly reach the axis and therefore are limited by a minimum angle @xmath113 .",
    "moreover @xmath114 bounds the solution only if we demand exact reflection symmetry about the equator .",
    "solutions are thus generally defined on a wedge given by @xmath115 . in order to be able to start at will from either a sub- or super - alfvnic point ,",
    "a systematic search for singular points of the system has been conducted .",
    "this allows us to restrict a first guess for the typical values to use as input for the system .",
    "several general criteria have been employed to further constrain the solutions .",
    "first the radial velocity @xmath116 must vanish once , to have inflow - outflow , and only once , to avoid a higher order convection pattern .",
    "we also require @xmath82 and @xmath117 to vanish at both boundaries , since there must be no mass flux across them , and since only zero angular momentum material can reach the axis ( which all material lying strictly in the equator does ) . in practice ,",
    "the first of these two conditions is sufficient to impose the second one .",
    "the same constraints apply to the magnetic field components .",
    "we take @xmath82 to be negative in order to get a circulation pattern rising over the poles , and @xmath117 to be positive as a convention .",
    "we require also that @xmath116 is either decreasing or constant with increasing angle and that the density and pressure attain their maxima close to @xmath118 .    to find solutions satisfying all of the previous requirements a monte carlo shooting method has been used starting from values corresponding to either sub- or super - alfvnic starting points .",
    "solutions have been found using as starting points successively @xmath113 , @xmath118 and the stream - line turning point where the radial velocity vanishes .",
    "it has been found that the most convenient starting point is @xmath113 .",
    "results of these investigations and representative cases are shown below .",
    "most of the present models for star formation deal only with low mass stars .",
    "it is then natural to begin with this type of object .",
    "the solution shown in fig.[figsol2 ] is representative of this class in the virial - isothermal approximation .",
    "it shows the variations with angle of the six self - similar variables ( related to velocity ( @xmath116 , @xmath82 , @xmath117 ) , density ( @xmath66 and @xmath79 ) , magnetic field ( @xmath119 , @xmath18 ) ) together with poloidal and toroidal mach numbers ( @xmath71 , @xmath72 ) and poloidal component of the poynting flux ( @xmath120 ) . in this solution",
    "we have taken @xmath121 and @xmath122 in order to compare with solutions given in fh1 . as discussed in the previous paragraph , various requirements",
    "have been met ; @xmath117 and @xmath82 both vanish at the polar and equatorial boundaries , as do the magnetic field components ( @xmath22 is diverging ) .",
    "the maxima for rotation velocity and poynting flux , corresponding to the minimum in @xmath82 , occur where the radial velocity changes signs .",
    "this point defines the total opening angle of the outflow which in this model is of the order of @xmath123 .",
    "the radial component of the poynting flux @xmath124 changes signs as @xmath116 does , but its poloidal component defined by @xmath125 remains positive by definition and shows only a slight dip near maximum .",
    "the high velocity outflow is of course much more narrowly collimated than the general outflow ( @xmath126 ) .",
    "the density @xmath66 is always superior to the alfvnic critical density and both densities are almost equal where @xmath116 changes sign .",
    "thus the flow is always super - alfvnic as confirmed by the mach number components in fig.[figsol2 ] .",
    "since differences between @xmath119 and @xmath127 are not evident to the eye in this figure , we have plotted the poloidal component of poynting flux as given by eq .",
    "[ poynting2 ] .",
    "it shows the peak energy carried by the magnetic field to be at the turning point of the flow .",
    "thus this calculation produces wide angle relatively slow outflows surrounding a fast component that is identifiable with the ehv outflows or ` molecular jets ' . we shall see below that inclusion of the poynting flux allows more collimated and faster ` jets ' surrounded by a slower wide angle outflow than is the case without it .",
    "therefore the magnetic field plays a crucial role in the yso outflow despite its conservative nature .    for embedded sources ( class 0/i ) most of the circumstellar matter",
    "is distributed in an envelope with a typical size of about @xmath128 au ( adams et al .",
    "@xcite , terebey et al .",
    "@xcite , andr & montmerle @xcite ) .",
    "the size that we will use to present our solutions will be of this order .",
    "for example , two poloidal projections of the streamlines are represented in fig.[figstream ] out to a radius of 4000 au .",
    "on the left panel ( case a ) , the previous solution is shown from ( nearly ) @xmath111 to ( nearly ) @xmath114 . in the panel on the right ( case b )",
    "we show the result of varying the magnetic field and density from the previous values .",
    "the solution shown stops at @xmath129 and the empty region is outside of the domain of the solution .",
    "if the pressure and tangential velocity matching were done properly at the boundaries , a rotating bondi accretion flow ( henriksen and heaton @xcite ) might describe naturally a true accretion disc .",
    "the self - similar structure of the streamlines does not in fact strictly match an arbitrary boundary condition at infinity , but the calculated symmetry seems to be a natural small scale limit of a more general self - gravitating circulation flow .",
    "moreover the maximal meridional velocity close to the axial region ( see fig.[figsol2 ] ) shows the tendency for the flow to collimate cylindrically along the axis of rotation .",
    "this is in agreement with lery et al .",
    "( @xcite , @xcite ) where it is shown that cylindrical collimation is a general asymptotic behavior of magnetized outflows surrounded by an external pressure , due in the present case to the outer part of the molecular cloud or the interstellar medium .",
    "fig.[fig : above ] presents a zoom of streamlines in the axial region view from above .",
    "streamlines start in the equatorial region and end in the axial region with small angles ( @xmath130 to 0.15 ) .",
    "in addition to the meridional behavior shown previously in fig.[figstream ] , each streamline makes a spiraling approach to the axis and then emerges in the form of an helix wrapped about the axis of symmetry .",
    "the closer in angle to the equator the streamline starts , the larger the angle of rotation it makes around the axis , the closer it gets to the central mass , and the nearer to the axis it asymptotically emerges . on the other hand , for streamlines beginning well above the equator",
    ", rotation is very nearly negligible and the path almost remains in a poloidal plane .",
    "indirect measurements of the magnetic field in protostars are presently available ( inferred from the radio flux from gyro - synchrotron emission by ray et al .",
    "@xcite , and hughes @xcite ) .",
    "such measurements can provide a critical test of models . in fig.[figmag ]",
    "the angular dependences of the components of the magnetic field are shown in gauss at a distance of @xmath131 au for the same illustrative example of a low mass protostar .",
    "magnetic fields of the order of a milligauss or less are obtained with a peak around 1 mgauss that coincides in angle with the radial turning point of the flow . as required by the quadrupolar geometry @xmath132 and @xmath133 vanish both on the equator and on the axis , while @xmath134 vanishes only on the axis and at the opening angle , where the largest field intensity exists .",
    "one remarkable prediction of these models is that the magnetic field at a given radius varies dramatically with angle ( and hence probably with inclination to the line of sight ) .",
    "the values range from 10 microgauss to a milligauss at @xmath128 au , from @xmath135 to a few gauss at 20 to 40 au in agreement with some observations ( ray et al .",
    "peak field strengths may reach values as high as 1 to 100 gauss at 1 au ( e.g. hughes @xcite ) , as shown in fig.[figdist ] .",
    "there is also a weaker dependence on the self - similar index as is also shown in fig.[figdist ] .",

    "if the magnetic field varies secularly as the evolution proceeds , then a sequence of our models could be regarded as a series of ` snapshots ' of the protostellar evolution .",

    "indeed , this has been observationally verified by velusamy and langer ( @xcite ) , who provide evidence that outflows widen in time .",
    "moreover when the magnetic field reaches a lower threshold in our model , the solution becomes a pure outflow .",

    "the density decreases close to the equator for the largest values of the temperature with a maximum well away from the equator .",
    "such solutions accrete so rapidly in the equatorial plane that they have a reduced density relative to their rotationally supported surroundings .",
    "these solutions resemble the special case @xmath156 as discussed in appendix b. on the other hand the temperature has little effect on the density profile in the axial region , although it broadens the central ` funnel ' substantially .",
    "we note that solutions for cold flows ( @xmath159 ) have also been obtained .",
    "in such a case , the circulation is powered only by poynting flux since our bernoulli integral ( eq .",

    "the importance of this analysis is that it allows us to directly compare the observable features of our models with real observational data .",

    "our purpose in this section will be mainly to outline the qualitative features of our models , leaving a complete exploration of the parameter space for the second paper in our series .",
    "the method that we follow is essentially the same as that outlined in fh2 , except that the code used there has been substantially improved in a number of respects .",
    "firstly , we are now able to generate results with much higher spectral and spatial resolution . secondly ,",
    "although we compute spectra on a grid of pencil beams through the outflow source , we convolve our spectra with a gaussian telescope beam to more accurately simulate observational results .",
    "fh2 , on the other hand , did not perform this convolution , which resulted in many spuriously sharp features in their maps .",
    "thirdly , we do not embed our solutions in a background of molecular gas to simulate the molecular cloud , which presumably surrounds the outflow .",
    "fh2 demonstrated that the presence of background material has no significant effect on the spectra or maps , except for in the lowest , and hence least interesting , velocity channels .",
    "since we are primarily interested in emission at relatively high velocities , corresponding to the outflow , emission or absorption by relatively slow moving background gas is of no consequence . as in fh2 ,",
    "the primary limitation of our analysis is that we assume local thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "although this is probably not strictly true , we do expect the @xmath161 level populations to be approximately in equilibrium with the local temperature provided that the optical depth is at least moderately high .",
    "therefore , we hope to capture at least the character of the emission , if not the precise intensity .      we have assumed a mass of @xmath136 for the low mass solution , which implies a fiducial radius of @xmath163 using eq .",
    "we have also chosen a inclination angle of @xmath164 between the symmetry axis of the outflow and the plane of the sky . with",
    "the mass and @xmath23 determined , the density , temperature , and velocity are determined at any position by the dimensionless parameters @xmath165 and @xmath166 , and the radial scalings given by eqs .",
    "[ self1]-[selfrad ] .",
    "therefore , by constructing a line of sight through the cloud , we can compute the emission ( expressed as a radiation temperature ) as a function of velocity parallel to the line of sight ; examples of these spectra are shown in fig.[fig : lowspectra ] .",
    "we have computed spectra on a @xmath167 grid of map positions across the outflow .",
    "we find that the spectra shown in fig.[fig : lowspectra ] vary substantially with map position across the outflow .",
    "spectra computed near the map projection of the outflow axis typically show relatively high velocity wings that may extend up to several @xmath10 , but the emission generally becomes too weak to show past @xmath168 .",
    "we note that the strongest emission always occurs at low velocities , with relatively weak emission in the wings , as is the case for real outflows .",
    "spectra may contain either a single wing or both red and blue - shifted wings depending on whether a particular line of sight crosses only a single lobe of the outflow or both .",
    "there are also many cases where line wings are absent , but well - defined `` shoulders '' are present on the low velocity dominated spectra .    in the equatorial regions of the maps ,",
    "double - peaked spectra are found with relatively low velocity peaks .",
    "these spectra are mainly due to the radial infall that dominates in the equatorial regions .",
    "it is unlikely that the double - peaked profiles are due to rotation , since radial infall velocities exceed the rotational velocities at all angles @xmath1 except for very near the radial turning point of the outflow .",
    "furthermore , many of the spectra have a slight asymmetry in which the blue - shifted peak shows stronger emission .",
    "this is suggestive of the well - known outflow asymmetry , which is due to the more efficient self - absorption of blue - shifted emission by overlying material moving towards the observer ( shepherd & churchwell @xcite , gregersen et al .",
    "@xcite , zhou et al .",
    "the effect is slight in this case since the low mass solution , with a @xmath136 central object , produces a peak optical depth of only @xmath169 along most lines of sight .",
    "the massive solutions , discussed in sect .  [ high : rad ] and [ high : iso ] , produces much higher optical depths and leads to a much more pronounced asymmetry .",
    "fig.[fig : lowmap ] shows a set of channel maps for the low mass solution . to make these synthetic maps , we have integrated the emission over @xmath170 wide channels from @xmath171 to @xmath172 .",
    "we have deliberately excluded the emission with @xmath173 , since we find that the lowest velocity emission is essentially featureless .",
    "we have convolved the maps with a gaussian telescope beam with a fwhm of @xmath174 ; for example , this corresponds to a @xmath175 beam at a distance of @xmath176 .",
    "the outflow is apparent at all velocities shown in our maps .",
    "we obtain a relatively wide outflow `` cone '' at the lowest velocities ( @xmath177 to @xmath178 ) and very well collimated jet - like emission apparent at velocities between @xmath179 and @xmath180 . at higher velocities ,",
    "the jet - like feature breaks up into outflow `` spots '' that move away from the central object as the velocity increases . _",
    "the most important feature of these channel maps is that the opening angle of the outflow gradually decreases as the magnitude of the velocity increases .",
    "_ as discussed in fh2 , this effect is entirely due to the angular velocity sorting of the outflow solutions .",
    "our models _ always _ have the property that the outflow velocity increases towards the axis of symmetry . _",
    "thus , our models naturally produce outflows in which most of the material is poorly collimated and moves at relatively low velocities , but the fastest jet - like components are very well collimated towards the axis of symmetry .",
    "_ this property has , in fact , been observed in a number of outflow sources ( bachiller et al .",

    "the solid line in the figure represents the blue - shifted emission , while the dashed line represents the red - shifted emission .",
    "we note that there are no important differences due to the somewhat low optical depth of our solution .",
    "we find that the intensity @xmath181 is well fit by a power law @xmath182 over all velocities greater than approximately @xmath183 .",
    "this power - law behavior has , in fact , been found for several real outflows , and the index is in reasonable agreement with the available data ( cabrit et al .",
    "@xcite , and richer et al .",
    "it remains to be seen , however , how sensitive the power - law index is to the parameters of our model .",
    "this important issue will be resolved in the second paper in this series , where we more completely explore the line emission of our models .",
    "an important feature of fig.[fig : lowiv ] is that the emission falls _ very _ rapidly with increasing velocity .",
    "for example , the intensity at even a rather modest velocity of @xmath184 is only @xmath185 of the peak intensity . at some velocity",
    ", the emission will fall below the noise threshold that is always present in real observations .",
    "past this velocity , the emission shown in fig.[fig : lowmap ] would be undetectable .    in fig.[fig",
    ": lowpv ] , we show a velocity - position diagram for a cut along the outflow axis . we have actually computed spectra along several cuts parallel to the outflow axis and convolved them with a gaussian beam to produce a single velocity - position diagram .",
    "we find that there is substantial emission at low velocities along the entire cut .",
    "the highest velocities are found near the map centre , as must be the case since @xmath186 by eq .",
    "[ self1 ] .",
    "we note that the emission contours in this figure are logarithmically spaced ; thus , we find that the most intense emission occurs at low velocities at all map positions .",
    "the outflow is apparent in fig.[fig : lowpv ] by the emission extending out to approximately @xmath187 on either side of the outflow .",
    "moreover , the general appearance of the position - velocity diagram is suggestive of a globally accelerated flow since higher velocities generally appear at greater distances from the central source . how can this be reconciled with the fact that velocity decreases with radius in our model ?",
    "it was shown in fh2 that the apparent acceleration is due to the unique velocity sorting that is predicted by our model .",
    "the radial velocity always increases with decreasing polar angle near the outflow axis .",
    "our cut crosses progressively smaller angles with increasing distance from the central object , and therefore encounters higher velocity material .",
    "the ragged appearance of the highest velocity contours is entirely due to the limitations of our numerical procedures at high velocities . in our model , the highest velocity components are extremely localized near the central star and the outflow axis .",
    "thus , whether or not a pencil beam passes through such a component is a matter of chance when the spatial extent falls below the grid spacing .",

    "we find , heuristically , that the peak optical depth in the line centre decreases with increasing central mass .",
    "since the mass is a free parameter , we have tuned it to achieve realistic optical depths of order unity .",
    "the mass is larger than for the low mass solution discussed above , but the effects of radiative heating are more likely to become important in outflows surrounding more massive protostars , in any case .",
    "the only other parameter that we have changed is the fwhm of the gaussian beam that we convolve with our solution ; here , we can use a slightly larger and more realistic 10 arcsec beam without smearing out the details of the solution . as in sect .",
    "[ sec : low ] , we have computed spectra on a @xmath167 grid of map positions assumed a @xmath164 inclination angle .    qualitatively , we find a great deal of similarity with the low mass solution .",
    "the line profiles shown in fig.[fig : radspectra ] have similar structure , and the outflow shown in fig.[fig : radmap ] is collimated to a similar degree .",
    "the main difference is the velocity of the flow . in the radiative case",
    ", we find that there is significant emission out to at least @xmath191 , and we find some low intensity emission out to @xmath192 ; this is most clearly illustrated by the position velocity diagram shown in fig.[fig : radpv ] .",
    "examining the intensity - velocity diagram shown in fig.[fig : radiv ] , we find that the intensity @xmath193 for velocities greater than about @xmath194 .",
    "it is striking that nearly the same power law index should be obtained for both the low mass and radiative solutions .",
    "admittedly , we do not fully understand the reasons for this similarity in behavior at present .",
    "we also doubt that this sort of behavior is a generic feature of our models . nevertheless , we are encouraged that at least some of our models are capable of reproducing such realistic observed properties .",
    "we have also computed the @xmath161 emission of the high mass solution discussed previously in sect .",
    "[ high : iso ] .",

    "such high optical depths cause real difficulty for the present version of our code , since any given line of sight encounters the `` photosphere '' , where the optical depth at some velocity is approximately unity , rather abruptly .",
    "thus , a great deal of care was taken to ensure that the solution was well - sampled along each line of sight .",

    "the inclusion of this effect allows us to obtain faster and more collimated outflows .",
    "the path followed by material also differs from fh1 as shown in fig.[figstcomp ] , where streamlines from fh1 and the present models are plotted .",
    "all the solutions start from approximately the same initial position in the equatorial region with the same set of parameters .",
    "streamlines from the present model get closer to the source than the fh1 solution , for both radiative and virial - isothermal cases .",
    "thus , in the present model , the flow passes relatively close to the central mass .",
    "the limiting speed is about the escape speed from the central mass ( and the jet speed ) of a few hundred @xmath10 .",
    "we note that the most collimated of the the three solutions is the radiative case .",
    "the steady configurations presented in this article should develop strong shocks in the axial region due to the strong collimation created by magnetic and pressure forces .",
    "moreover current - carrying jets , as in the present model , are liable to kelvin - helmholtz ( kh ) , pressure driven ( pd ) and magnetic instabilities driven by the electrical current .",
    "these so called current driven ( cd ) instabilities have been studied only recently in the context of astrophysical jets ( appl @xcite , appl et al .",
    "we use the results of the latter linear stability analysis in order to get a rough estimate of cdi and khi in our magnetic configuration .",
    "growth rates @xmath201 of the different modes show that the cd helical mode ( @xmath202 ) dominates the cd pinching mode ( @xmath203 ) and that cd and kh instabilities become comparable when the mach number approaches unity .",
    "this is the case in the present self - similar model .",
    "the cd instability ( with a typical wavelength @xmath204 , @xmath205 being the characteristic size of the outflow ) should be located on a current sheet where reconnection and particle acceleration might occur .",
    "kh pinching modes ( @xmath206 ) should dominate kh helical modes , and consequently give rise to internal shocks in the outflow .",
    "all these results require numerical simulations that we plan to study in another paper .",
    "in this paper we have presented a model based on the @xmath0-self - similarity assumption applied to the basic equations of ideal axisymmetric and stationary mhd , including poynting flux .",
    "detailed comparisons with the observations have been computed and characteristic scales of the problem have been given as functions of source properties .",
    "the luminosity needed for radiative heating is smaller even while driving faster outflows than in the previous model ( fh1 ) .",
    "the model geometry implies a natural connection between the fast ionized jets seen near the polar axis of the wind , and the slower and less - collimated molecular outflows that surround them , although the jets may be partly due to central activity not included in our model .",
    "the most massive protostars produce the fastest flows with maximum radial velocities in the axial region .",
    "radiative heating produces faster outflows compared to the virial - isothermal case , for both low and high mass objects .",
    "larger opening angles are associated with smaller magnetic fields .",
    "consequently , a gradual evolutionary loss of magnetic flux may result in outflows that widen as they age .",
    "synthetic spectral lines from @xmath161 ( j=@xmath162 ) allow direct comparison with observational results via channel maps , maps of total emission , position - velocity and intensity - velocity diagrams .",
    "the model reproduces well observational features . due to internal instabilities in the most collimated ` jet ' part of the flow",
    ", the time evolution of the steady model should give rise to regularly spaced knots , and possibly excitation , ionization and non - thermal particle acceleration due to field annihilation and shock dissipation .",
    "thus the model in its current state of development shows that _ radiative heating combined with poynting flux driving is efficient in producing high velocity outflows when the characteristic luminosity of the forming star ( as deduced from observations ) is used_. more extensive searches in parameter space , the detailed fit to specific sources , and time dependent modeling all remain to be done .",
    "although we do not discuss the regions excluded from the self - similar region of the flow , the current correspondence to observational features is sufficiently exact that we expect simultaneous infall / outflow ( ` circulation ' ) to be an essential part of any realistic model .",
    "we would like to thank sylvie cabrit for constructive and useful discussions .",
    "the mass flux conservation equation remains the same as in fh1 : @xmath207 while the self - similar variable @xmath22 is simply replaced by its poloidal component in the following set of equations :    magnetic flux conservation : @xmath208 radial component of momentum equation : @xmath209 other equations of the system contain terms with mixed toroidal and poloidal components ; angular momentum conservation : @xmath210 faraday s law plus zero comoving electric field : @xmath211u_{{\\phi}}u_{{r}}+u_{{\\phi}}u _ { { \\theta}}{\\frac { d } { d \\theta}}\\ln \\left[\\frac{1}{y_{{p}}}-\\frac{1}{y _ { { \\phi}}}\\right]=0 \\label{faraday}\\ ] ] @xmath1-component of momentum equation : @xmath212 to treat the radiative heating we either hold @xmath8 constant ( virial - isothermal case ) as discussed above , or we include the equations of radiative diffusion ( radiative case ) as in fh1 . the equations ( 17 ) , ( 18 ) and ( 22 ) of fh1 continue to apply provided that the optical depth given above is @xmath213 .",
    "equations ( [ mfc ] ) and ( [ bfc ] ) together yield the first integral @xmath214 where @xmath119 replaces @xmath22 in fh1 . moreover directly from eq .",
    "[ mfc ] and the poloidal stream - line equation @xmath215 we have the stream - line integral @xmath216 from this we see immediately that @xmath217 if we are to have quadrupolar stream - lines for which @xmath218 as @xmath219 .",
    "a second stream - line integral follows from eq .",
    "[ bfc ] and the stream - line equation , but it is not independent of eqs .  [ integral1 ] and [ stream1 ] since it follows by eliminating @xmath66 between these two .",
    "the limit @xmath220 follows immediately from eq .",
    "[ integral1 ] if we require finite @xmath66 , @xmath221 and odd symmetry in the magnetic field at the equator .",
    "the integral then implies implies that @xmath222 and so the field passes through zero in the equatorial plane .",
    "this conclusion is avoided on the polar axis since the radial velocity is free to become very large there .",
    "this choice has the additional merit that the equator is super alfvnic as well as the axis .    using eq .",
    "[ bfc ] together with faraday s law ( [ faraday ] ) we obtain the integral @xmath223 \\left(\\frac{\\sin{\\theta}}{y_p}\\right)^ { \\frac{1/4-\\alpha}{5/4+\\alpha } } u_\\theta^{\\frac{3}{2(5/4+\\alpha)}}=q_2 . \\label{integral2}\\ ] ] note that the constant @xmath224 is very interesting because it can be used to measure the strength of the electric field which is in fact @xmath225 \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{r_o^3 } } \\left(\\frac{r}{r_o}\\right)^{\\alpha-\\frac{5}{4 } } \\left[\\frac{1}{y_p}-\\frac{1}{y_\\phi}\\right ] \\left(\\vec{u_\\phi}\\times\\vec{u_p}\\right).\\ ] ] the integral is not present in fh1 since the electric field is everywhere zero there .",
    "in general we can not find an angular momentum integral explicitly ( this is related to the difficulty of expressing scale invariance in an action principle ; b. gaffet , private communication ) but in the special case of similarity index @xmath156 such an explicit integral exists in the form ( cf fh1 ) : @xmath226 although this is a very special case _ not _ normally related to our numerical solutions ( the mass density is constant in radius so that eventually the dominance of the central mass is broken as @xmath0 increases ) , it is instructive to consider it further .",
    "eq .  [ integral1 ] becomes simply @xmath227 so that @xmath228 and @xmath229",
    ".  [ integral2 ] and [ integral3 ] can be solved together for @xmath119 and @xmath127 to give @xmath230 and @xmath231 we therefore observe that near the equator @xmath119 can be infinite _ only _ if @xmath232 faster than @xmath82 . this feature is shared with our numerical solutions , but of course the equator is strictly outside the domain of the solution . from the second equation we see that @xmath127 tends to zero at the equator under the same conditions . if one were to insist that @xmath233 at the equator , then eq .  [ integral3 ] shows that we need @xmath234 there , or by the above mach number definitions @xmath235 .",
    "our solutions for @xmath119 and @xmath127 show that this is only possible if @xmath236 , that is with zero poynting flux .",
    "thus it seems from our analysis of this special case ( however we always find @xmath237 at the equator in our solutions ) that the presence of a non - zero poynting flux is not compatible with a keplerian equatorial disc .",
    "the material there is falling radially towards the star .",
