    "the proof of this theorem , together with a more detailed set of the implications between the properties of @xmath74 and the corresponding function @xmath82 , is provided in the appendix .",
    "the previous theorem simply tells us that any additive measure of athermality @xmath74 that does not increase under marginal - catalytic operations ( definition [ def : marginal - catalyticfreetransition ] ) or also under correlated - catalytic operations ( definition [ def : correlated - catalyticfreetransition ] ) is in one to one correspondence with a function @xmath82 that is additive , super - additive and fulfills the data processing inequality .",
    "this has as a first consequence that the measure @xmath73 fulfills indeed properties [ prop : fe : continuity]-[prop : fe : dpi ] .",
    "more importantly , using our re - formulation of matsumoto s result of theorem [ thm : maintheorem ] , we can show that @xmath73 is , up to a constant factor , the _ only _ measure of athermality that fulfills [ prop : fe : continuity]-[prop : fe : dpi ] .",
    "this is the content of our main result , which follows from theorem [ thm : equivalencemaintext ] .",
    "any monotone for marginal - catalytic transitions or correlated - catalytic transitions at environment temperature @xmath30 that is additive and depends continuously on the density matrix is proportional to @xmath109 .",
    "the implications of this result are that the free energy difference @xmath109 is the only _ bona fide _ quantifier of athermality under the most general set of free operations that do not create the resource .",
    "in this work , we have investigated the question which properties uniquely determine the quantum relative entropy among all function on pairs of quantum states . our re - formulation of matsumoto s",
    "result highlights the role of super - additivity as a key property in the axiomatic derivation of the quantum relative entropy .",
    "the role of super - additivity in the arena of quantum thermodynamics has been shown to be related to the build up of correlations between the system at hand and a catalyst , which in turn represents the components of the machine that come back to their initial state after the cyclic process .",
    "we have shown how the relative entropy and non - equilibrium free energy uniquely emerge from considerations about how to treat catalysts and their correlations in the resource theoretic approach to quantum thermodynamics .",
    "usually , notions of relative entropy are employed to capture asymptotic weakly correlated settings ( thermodynamic limit ) , thus when acting on many uncorrelated copies of a system ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent discussion of asymptotic thermodynamics from the point of view of resource theories ) .",
    "importantly , and in contrast , in our approach they emerge without having to invoke any thermodynamic limit , but rather follow from properties of monotones in the single - shot setting . however , they are precisely singled out by the fact that we disregard correlations in the setting of marginal - catalytic and correlated - catalytic free transitions .",
    "it thus seems that the crucial feature of for the emergence of free energy is thus the disregarding of correlations .",
    "note that this fits well to how these quantities appear in notions of macroscopic thermodynamics : macroscopic equilibrium thermodynamics usually emerges in large systems which are well within thermodynamic phases . in such phases , correlations decay exponentially in space .",
    "hence , the correlations of an object with its surrounding scale like its surface - area and not like their volume .",
    "macroscopic objects are then essentially uncorrelated with other objects due to their small surface - to - volume ratio .    in this work ,",
    "we have distinguished two ways of creating correlations with the catalyst , the marginal - catalytic one of definition [ def : marginal - catalyticfreetransition ] and the correlated - catalytic one of definition [ def : correlated - catalyticfreetransition ] .",
    "the first represents the situation where the components of the machine become correlated among themselves , while the second represents the case where the machine builds correlation with the system upon which the machine induces a transition .",
    "although these two sets both give rise to the free energy difference as a unique measure of athermality , we consider the latter as a much more adequate set of operations to incorporate correlations in thermodynamics .",
    "the reason for this is that the correlations build up between the catalyst and the system do not prevent one from re - using the catalyst to implement again a transition of the same kind on another system .",
    "it is an additional contribution of this work to flesh out this difference .",
    "we end the discussion by posing an interesting open question .",
    "this is to investigate how to characterize all the possible thermodynamic transitions that can be implemented with correlated - catalysts . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have seen that indeed the operations of definition [ def : correlated - catalyticfreetransition ] are more powerful than the ones of [ def : catalyticfreetransition ] . at the same time , it has been recently been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that a variant of definition [ def : correlated - catalyticfreetransition ] allows to extract work from passive states .",
    "the question remains whether all the transitions that do not increase the free energy difference @xmath73 are possible , as they indeed are for the ones of definition [ def : marginal - catalyticfreetransition ] , as shown in ref .",
    "if this is indeed true also for correlated - catalysts , one would have found an interpretation of the free energy as a unique criterium for the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "if it is not true , then it is necessary to consider genuinely new monotones , which are not additive or not continuous .",
    "both options would be interesting from the perspective of the further development of quantum thermodynamics .",

    "note that [ prop : mcatalyticmonotonicity ] implies [ prop : catalyticmonotonicity ] , since a correlated catalyst is a particular case of using a catalyst .",
    "together with the equivalences i ) and ii ) , we should only show super - additivity of eq . .",
    "this follows from the fact that @xmath146 to show this , let us choose as catalyst @xmath147 .",
    "the gp map performing the transition is just a swap between the initial system and the catalyst .",
    "hence , the final system is @xmath148 and the final catalyst @xmath149 , which clearly fulfills the conditions of definition [ def : marginal - catalyticfreetransition ] . to see iii ) ( @xmath141 ) , we first note that and already imply [ prop : catalyticmonotonicity ] and [ prop : fe : additivity ] .",

    "again , since correlated catalytic transitions include catalytic transitions , the only non - trivial property left to show here is that [ prop : ccatalyticmonotonicity ] and [ prop : fe : additivity ] also imply . to see this consider an initial object @xmath151 together with the catalyst @xmath152 and use a similar trick as for marginal catalytic transitions .",
    "since a swap between the second system of the initial object and the catalyst is a gibbs - preserving transition which leaves the catalyst correlated but otherwise unchanged , we know that @xmath153 .",
