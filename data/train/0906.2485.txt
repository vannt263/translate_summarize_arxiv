    "the cdf collaboration @xcite has recently observed a narrow structure in the @xmath4 mass spectrum of @xmath5 decays , which has been named y(4140 ) .",
    "its mass and decay width are @xmath6 = 4143.0 @xmath7 2.9(stat ) @xmath7 1.2(syst ) mev / c@xmath8 and @xmath9 = 11.7@xmath10(stat ) @xmath7 3.7(syst ) mev / c@xmath8 respectively , which suggest that its structure does not fit conventional expectations for charmonium states .",
    "the cdf collaboration expects that the @xmath4 final state , with positive c - parity and two j@xmath1 = 1@xmath11 vector mesons ( vv ) , is a good candidate for an exotic meson search .",
    "this resonance is well above the threshold for open charm decay @xmath12 at 3936.68 mev and a charmonium @xmath13 with this mass would decay into an open charm pair predominantly and have a small branching fraction into @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the mass of y(4140 ) is below the threshold of the decay channel @xmath14 at 4224.6 mev , and not far above the @xmath4 threshold at 4116.4 mev .",
    "more recently the belle collaboration reported preliminary results on y(4140 ) @xcite .",
    "no significant signal was found but their efficiency is low for the mass of y(4140 ) .",
    "the upper limit on the production rate @xmath15 is 6 @xmath16 at 90% c.l .",
    "this upper limit is lower than the central value of the cdf measurement @xmath17 @xcite which is thus considered not to contradict the cdf measurement .",
    "the belle collaboration also searched for y(4140 ) in the @xmath18 mass spectrum of the two - photon process @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "again , the efficiency was low and no signal was reported . in exchange ,",
    "evidence was found for a new narrow structure at 4.35 mev and width 13.3 mev , with a statistical significance of about @xmath20 in the @xmath21 mass spectrum .",
    "this resonance was named x(4350 ) .    as such",
    ", the present situation allows a new opportunity to look for exotics .",
    "the fashionable option of a @xmath22 molecule has been considered in refs . @xcite and the qcd sum rules in ref .",
    "@xcite . where states with @xmath23 or @xmath24 are favoured .",
    "let us note however that the belle collaboration measurement of a two - photon partial width difavours the scenario of y(4140 ) to be a @xmath22 molecule with @xmath23 or @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "prior to the observation of y(4140 ) by the cdf collaboration , predictions for tetraquarks @xmath0 seen as diquark - antidiquark systems with various @xmath25 were made in a simple non - relativistic model including @xmath26 = 0 and 1 partial waves in ref .",
    "@xcite and in a relativistic framework based on the quasipotential approach in ref . @xcite . in the latter , states with @xmath27 and",
    "@xmath28 acquired masses in the range 4.1 - 4.2 mev .",
    "we should also mention that the resonance y(4140 ) was studied as the second radial excitation of the p - wave charmonium @xmath29 ( @xmath30 = 0 and 1 ) , looking at the hidden charm decay mode .",
    "the conclusion was that such a description is problematic @xcite .    deciphering the nature of y(4140 ) , if confirmed in the future , ( presently the b - factories have a poor acceptance for @xmath31 in the desired range @xcite ) , is a new challenge .",
    "thus it is legitimate to consider the tetraquark interpretation without correlated quarks or antiquarks , and try to find out if the y(4140 ) fits into the spectrum of the @xmath0 system .",
    "most important , we search for the decay pattern given by this possible structure . for simplicity",
    ", we use the model of ref .",
    "@xcite which successfully describes the x(3872 ) as a @xmath3 tetraquark . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that x(3872 ) can be interpreted as an eigenstate of the chromomagnetic interaction , where the lowest 1@xmath2 has a dominant octet - octet component ( 0.9997 ) and a very small singlet - singlet component ( 0.026 ) which explains why this state decays with a very small width into @xmath32 or @xmath33 , in agreement with the experimental value for the total width @xmath34 2.3 mev of x(3872 )  @xcite , and that the @xmath35 + pseudoscalar channel is absent .",
    "as y(4140 ) is seen to be narrow and decays into two vector mesons we wonder whether or not the same mechanism can give an explanation of its small width , about 5 times larger than that of x(3872 ) , and similar to that of x(4350 ) , but considerably narrower than the decay width of every other x , y or z resonances .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ ham ] we introduce the quark model used in this study . in sec .",
    "[ bs ] we recall the basis states in the direct meson - meson channel with emphasis on the charge conjugation quantum number . in sec . [ me ]",
    "we present the matrix elements of the hamiltonian @xcite for @xmath36 and @xmath24 states . in sec .",
    "[ spectrum ] we show the calculated spectrum and discuss its features .",
    "the last section is devoted to conclusions . in appendix [ appa ]",
    "we derive the orthogonal transformation from the direct meson - meson channel to the exchange meson - meson channel for states @xmath27 , in appendix [ appb ] for states with @xmath37 and @xmath38 and in appendix [ appc ] for states with @xmath24 .",
    "appendix d is devoted to an attempt to dynamically derive effective masses in a standard constituent quark model in order to justify the simplicity of the present study and enlighten the choice of effective masses .",
    "this is an exploratory study , based on the simple model of ref .",
    "@xcite which can reveal the basic features of the @xmath0 tetraquark , especially the structure of the wave functions . in the next section",
    "we introduce the relevant basis states in the color - spin space , including both the singlet - singlet channels and the octet - octet , simply called hidden color channels .",
    "there are no correlated quarks or diquarks , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , for example .",
    "accordingly , the mass of a tetraquark is given by the expectation value of the effective hamiltonian @xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mcm ] ) contains the effective masses @xmath41 as parameters .",
    "the constants @xmath42 represent integrals in the orbital space of some unspecified radial forms of the chromomagnetic part of the one gluon - exchange interaction potential and of the wave functions .    a warning should be given to the way of determining the effective masses @xmath41 to be used for multiquark systems .",
    "besides the kinetic energy contribution , they incorporate the effect of a coulomb - like term and of the confinement , the latter still being an open problem @xcite .",
    "thus , in principle , they can not be directly extracted from meson or baryon spectra as discussed in appendix d. lack of better knowledge we however use the compromise proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath43 but due to the arbitrariness in the choice of effective masses of quarks , precise estimates of the absolute values of tetraquark masses is difficult to make .",
    "one can have an approximate idea about the range where the spectrum should be located .",
    "but a shift of the whole spectrum is justified and sometimes even performed , like in the popular work of maiani et al .",
    "@xcite , which deals with diquarks , where the arbitrariness in mass is even larger .    however , the relative distances between the eigenstates obtained from the chromomagnetic hamiltonian ( [ eq : hcm ] ) and the structure of its eigenstates do not depend on the effective masses , which is important for exploring the strong decay properties .    the parameters @xmath44 have been taken from ref .",
    "@xcite where a more complete list , containing also parameters needed in this work , is given .",
    "the required values are @xmath45 we should mention that the above parameters were extracted from a global fit to meson and baryon ground states . for some mesons into which y(4140 ) can decay in table [ pdgmass ] we compare the experimental masses of pdg @xcite with the theoretical values obtained from the two - body version of ( [ eq : mcm ] ) and ( [ eq : hcm ] ) in the parametrization ( [ eq : par ] ) which is @xmath46 where q stands here for any light or heavy quark .",
    "below they are used to estimate the expectation value of @xmath47 corresponding to a @xmath48 system described by a trial wave function of the form @xmath49 $ ] , @xmath50 being a variational parameter , as above . here , for convenience",
    ", we use the internal coordinates @xmath51 corresponding to fig .",
    "1a . note that this function can be defined in any of the coordinate systems of fig .",
    "1 . using the coordinates ( [ radial ] ) we can work out the matrix elements of the flavor operators of ( [ pot ] ) in the basis @xmath52 of sec .",
    "the desired expectation values obtained with the parametres ( [ par ] ) are shown in table [ toy ] for all considered systems .    from these results",
    "we can define effective masses in a similar way as in ref .",
    "we have @xmath53 which lead to @xmath54 although we rely on the same pdg data @xcite these masses are different from those of eq .",
    "( [ eq : mass ] ) proposed in ref . @xcite .",
    "the difference is however very small for the @xmath55 quark and this can be explain by the cancellation of the kinetic and potential energies , as one can see from table [ toy ] .",
    "such a cancellation does not take place for the quark @xmath56 .",
    "thus in a dynamical approach based on a hamiltonian like ( [ ham ] ) there is a cancellation of various parts of the hamiltonian .",
    "the cancellation is more subtle in a tetraquark which has 6 distinct quark - quark or quark - antiquark pairs , while in a meson there is only one pair .",
    "it follows then that the effective masses needed for a tetraquak can be different from those of eq .",
    "( [ eff : mass ] ) . indeed , using table [ toy ]",
    ", we obtain @xmath57 which is different from the sum of masses in ( [ eff : mass ] ) .",
    "this proves that one can not use the same effective masses in mesons and tetraquarks . in this light",
    "we can consider the choice ( [ eq : mass ] ) acceptable and understand why the agreement with the experiment in table [ pdgmass ] is unsatisfactory for mesons .",
    "a better knowledge of the confinement and more precise calculations are necessary to obtain the mass of the @xmath48 tetraquark relative to the @xmath4 threshold .",
