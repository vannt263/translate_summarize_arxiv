    "in the recent decade and a half there has been a lot of activity on the topic of non - gibbsian measures .",
    "most of the original studies were based on the question of whether renormalised hamiltonians exist as properly defined objects , @xcite , with an emphasis on discrete - spin models .",
    "another issue , which also arose in physics but somewhat later @xcite , was the following question : apply a ( stochastic ) dynamics which converges to a system at a temperature @xmath1 to an initial state at temperature @xmath2 for a finite time .",
    "is the resulting measure in this transient non - equilibrium regime a gibbs measure ? could it be described in terms of an effective temperature ( hopefully between initial and final one ) ?",
    "again the first results @xcite were for discrete spins . afterwards more general dynamics and",
    "also unbounded spins were investigated in @xcite .",
    "although the work of @xcite was about continuous spins , there remains something of a problem , in that for unbounded spins the notion of what one should call gibbsianness for a `` reasonable '' interaction is less clear than in the compact case .",
    "thus it turned out to be of interest to see how a model with compact but continuous spins behaves .",
    "another extension of the original investigations was the investigation into the question of what the proper mean - field version of the gibbs - non - gibbs question might be .",
    "for this , see in particular @xcite .",
    "this question has a particular charm for systems with a general local spin space .    as there have recently been a number of reviews on other aspects of the non - gibbsian problem @xcite , we here want to emphasize what has been found for @xmath3-vector spins .",
    "the results as yet are less complete than what is known for ising or potts spins , but it has also become clear that , although many things are similar , such systems have traits of their own which are somewhat different and require new ideas .",
    "we have mostly worked on transformations such as stochastic evolution , which does not rescale space , such as renormalisation group transformations do .",
    "note that in a statistical interpretation , such maps for discrete spins model imperfect observations , that is observations in which with some probability one makes a mistake , an interpretation which already was mentioned in @xcite . for continuous spins ,",
    "the probability of staying exactly at the initial value is zero , but for short times the map is close to the identity in the sense that the distribution of an evolved spin is concentrated on a set close to the initial value .",
    "we obtained conservation of gibbsianness under stochastic evolutions when either the time is short , or when both initial and final temperature are high .",
    "we also found that loss of gibbsianness occurs if the initial temperature is low , and the dynamics is an infinite - temperature one .",
    "if the initial system is in an external field , after a long time the measure can become gibbsian again .",
    "in fact , here we extend the regime where such results can be proven .",
    "another question we could address is the discretisation question . if one approximates a continuous model by a discrete one , is the approximation still a gibbs measure , now for discrete spins ?",
    "morally , this question is somewhat related to renormalisation - type questions , as in both cases some coarse - graining takes place , in which the transformed system only contains part of the initial information .",
    "it turns out that the transformed measure is gibbsian , once the discretisation is fine enough .",
    "all of these questions , the high - temperature and short - time gibbsianness for stochastic evolutions , as well as the loss and recovery properties , can also be addressed in the mean - field setting , and we find that the results are similar as in the lattice case .",
    "again , for transformations which in some sense are close enough to the identity , the transformed model is gibbsian .",
    "finally , one may ask which of our results depend on the fact that our local state space is a sphere and not just a compact space ? the regularity results ( preservation of gibbsianness ) do not , as they are based on absence of phase transitions .",
    "in fact , such extensions have been proved , for which we refer to the original papers .",
    "when it comes to a failure of gibbsianness , an internal phase transition has to be exhibited .",
    "the mechanism of this is usually very model - dependent and this is where the intricacy but also the charm of the @xmath3-vector models lies .",
    "in this section we review some recent developments in the study of gibbsianness and non - gibbsianness for @xmath0vector models subjected to various transformations .",
    "the review is mainly based on the recent papers @xcite .",
    "before we plunge into details let us fix some definitions , notation and give some background from the theory of lattice spin systems .      for general information on gibbs measures for lattice spins systems",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite . in this review",
    "we will focus attention on models living on a @xmath4dimensional lattice @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "we will take @xmath7 , the @xmath0dimensional sphere , as the single - site spin space equipped with a borel probability measure @xmath8 ( the a priori measure ) .",
    "the measures we will study shall be given by hamiltonians .",
    "the hamiltonians in a finite volume @xmath9 , with boundary condition @xmath10 outside @xmath11 , will be given by @xmath12 where the interaction @xmath13 is a translation - invariant family of functions @xmath14 , with @xmath15 depending only on the spins in the finite volume @xmath16 .",
    "it satisfies the following absolute summability condition    @xmath17    the * gibbs measures * for the interaction @xmath13 are the measures @xmath18 on @xmath19 whose finite - volume conditional distributions are given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the product measure of @xmath8 over the sites in @xmath11 .",
    "another , equivalent , way of defining a gibbs measure was identified by kozlov @xcite , via two properties of the family of conditional distributions @xmath22 .",
    "these properties are * uniform nonnullness * and * quasilocality*. the latter property holds for a measure @xmath18 if for all @xmath23 , @xmath24 and configurations @xmath25 there exists a @xmath26 and @xmath27 such that for all pairs of configurations @xmath28",
    "@xmath29    a collection @xmath30 of everywhere defined conditional distributions @xmath31 satisfying all the above conditions is referred to as a * gibbsian specification*.    now what can be said about the gibbs properties of transformed gibbsian @xmath0vector models ? in @xcite the gibbs properties of various transformations acting on @xmath0vector models were investigated and we will review the results below .",
    "we discuss conservation of gibbsianness for initial gibbsian @xmath0vector lattice models subjected to local transformations close to the identity .",
    "the discussion will mainly follow @xcite .",
    "though these two papers use different techniques , the results proved therein have some common ground and we will compare the advantages and disadvantages of both methods . we will mainly address conservation of gibbsianness for transformed initial gibbs measures in this subsection .",
    "we start with a gibbs measure @xmath18 of an @xmath0vector model and apply local transformations to it .",
    "examples of such local transformations are infinite - temperature diffusive dynamics ( sitewise independent brownian motions on spheres ) , fuzzification or discretisation of the local spin space , etc .",
    "the natural question that comes to mind is whether such a transformed measure @xmath32 is a gibbs measure . for transformations close to identity",
    "the above question can be answered in the affirmative .",
    "this we make precise in the sequel by first stating a theorem which is the intersection of the results found in @xcite .",
    "[ mainthm ] suppose @xmath18 is the gibbs measure for a translation invariant interaction @xmath13 on @xmath33 .",
    "further , assume that @xmath13 is twice continuously differentiable and of finite range .",
    "let @xmath34 be the transformed ( time - evolved ) measure obtained by applying infinite - temperature diffusive dynamics to @xmath18 .",
    "then for short times the time - evolved measure @xmath34 is a gibbs measure .",
    "theorem [ mainthm ] can be proved either by using cluster expansion techniques as in @xcite or by dobrushin uniqueness techniques @xcite .",
    "the results proved in these papers generalise the above theorem in different directions . in the following",
    "we will review some of the main issues discussed in them .",
    "let us start with the approach of @xcite .",
    "the advantage of using cluster expansion techniques is that we can prove short - time gibbsianness for more general dynamics beyond the independent brownian motion on the circles . in particular",
    ", one can handle a whole class of systems which are modeled via the solution @xmath35 of the following system of _ interacting _ stochastic differential equations : @xmath36 where @xmath37 denotes a family of independent brownian motions moving on a circle , @xmath38 and @xmath39 is the `` dynamical '' inverse temperature .",
    "we assumed that the `` dynamical '' hamiltonian @xmath40 is built from an absolute summable `` dynamical '' interaction which is again of finite range and at least twice continuously differentiable .",
    "let @xmath41 denote the semigroup of the dynamics defined in .",
    "then one can prove that for all values of @xmath42 the time - evolved measure @xmath43 is gibbsian for short times .",
    "note that the statement of theorem [ mainthm ] corresponds to the case where @xmath44 .",
    "we note that the cluster expansion technology was heavily influenced by @xcite .",
    "extensions to different graphs are also immediate . + the proof in @xcite makes also use of the fact that @xmath45 where",
    "@xmath46 and @xmath47 are considered to be the same points .",
    "consequently we can work on the real line and do not have to worry about more general compact manifolds @xmath48 .",
    "although it is in principle possible to write a cluster expansion for @xmath48 and we believe that short - time gibbsianness for general interacting dynamics holds also in higher spin dimensions , this has not been done so far .",
    "next let us review the results in @xcite .",
    "the dobrushin uniqueness technique employed in that work applies to more general interactions on general @xmath3-spheres and also to more general graphs aside from @xmath5 .",
    "moreover , we expect that it provides better bounds for the gibbsian regime than the cluster expansion approach does . on the other hand ,",
    "no results for interacting dynamics have been obtained via this approach , although we believe in principle this should be possible .",
    "to be precise , one considers initial gibbs measures for interactions @xmath13 with finite triple norm , i.e. @xmath49 note that this summability condition implies the one in and here we do nt require that @xmath13 is translation invariant .",
    "initial gibbs measures of such interactions were subjected to local ( one - site ) transformations given by @xmath50 , with @xmath51 . here",
    "@xmath25 represents the spin variable for the transformed system taking values in a compact separable metrizable space @xmath52 , which now needs not be the same as @xmath7 .    in the language of renormalization group transformations",
    ", one could think of the transformed system as the renormalized system obtained via the single - site renormalization map @xmath53 .",
    "the map @xmath53 can also be thought of as the transition kernel for an infinite - temperature dynamics , where the variable in the second slot will be the configuration of the system at some time after starting the dynamics from the configuration in the first slot of @xmath53 .",
    "sometimes we will refer to the time direction as the `` vertical '' direction .",
    "starting with an initial gibbs measure @xmath18 for an interaction @xmath13 with finite triple norm , in @xcite it was studied to what extent the transformed measure @xmath54 will be gibbsian . in the above we have set @xmath55 .",
    "the study in @xcite uses dobrushin uniqueness techniques .",
    "the paper also provides continuity estimates for the single - site conditional distributions of the transformed system whenever it is gibbsian . to introduce these estimates",
    "the authors made use of a so - called `` goodness matrix '' , which describes the spatial decay of the conditional distributions of the transformed measure .",
    "+ in the sequel we will write @xmath56 for @xmath57 and @xmath58 for @xmath59 .",
    "in particular the following definition from @xcite will be used .",
    "[ otto ] assume that @xmath60 is a metric on @xmath7 and @xmath61 is a non - negative matrix with @xmath62 .",
    "a gibbsian specification @xmath30 is said to be of goodness @xmath63 if the single - site parts @xmath64 satisfy the continuity estimates @xmath65 here @xmath66 is the variational distance between the measures @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "the matrix @xmath69controls the influnce on the specification due to variations in the conditioning when we measure them in the metric @xmath60 .",
    "the faster @xmath69 decays , the better , or `` more gibbsian '' , the system of conditional probabilities is .",
    "we note , without going into details , that a fast decay of @xmath69 also implies th existence of a fast decaying interaction potential , but in our view an estimate of the form ( 7 ) is more fundamental than a corresponding estimate on the potential .",
    "we are restricting our attention to single - site @xmath70 s since all @xmath71 for finite @xmath11 can be expressed by an explicit formula in terms of the @xmath64 s with @xmath72 . for the solution of this `` reconstruction - problem '' see @xcite .",
    "the dobrushin interdependence matrix @xmath73 of a gibbsian specification @xmath30 @xcite , is the matrix with smallest matrix - elements for which the specification @xmath30 is of the goodness @xmath74 . here",
    "@xmath60 is the discrete metric on @xmath7 given by @xmath75 .",
    "one says that @xmath30 satisfies the * dobrushin uniqueness condition * whenever the dobrushin constant @xmath76 , and such a gibbsian specification @xmath30 admits a unique gibbs measure @xcite .",
    "let us now introduce some notation for our discussion on conservation of gibbsianness for transforms of gibbs measures .",
    "set for each @xmath77 , @xmath78 , the a priori measures on the initial spin space which are obtained by conditioning on transformed spin configurations .",
    "we call @xmath79 the posterior ( pseudo-)metric , associated to @xmath80 on the transformed spin space @xmath52 .",
    "@xmath81 satisfies non - negativity and the triangular inequality , but we may have @xmath82 for @xmath83 ( which happens e.g. if @xmath84 and @xmath85 are independent under @xmath80 ) .",
    "for any given @xmath13 with finite triple norm write @xmath86 for @xmath87 where @xmath88 is as in .",
    "consider the matrix @xmath89 here we have denoted by @xmath90 , for @xmath91 a real - valued observable on @xmath92 , the oscillation of @xmath91 given by @xmath93 the above quantity @xmath94 , can be small if either the initial interaction @xmath13 is weak or the measures @xmath95 are close to delta measures . for example",
    "this is the case for short - time evolution of the initial gibbs measure associated with @xmath13 , as we will point out later .",
    "@xmath96 is an upper bound on the dobrushin matrices for the joint systems consisting of the initial and the transformed spins vertically coupled via the map @xmath53 , and having fixed transformed configurations .",
    "a specification for this sytem is generated by @xmath97 by replacing in equation ( 3 ) the a priori measure @xmath98 by the @xmath99 s .",
    "the main tool used in @xcite to show gibbsianness of the transformed measure was the lack of phase transitions in the conditional joint system discussed above .",
    "this lack of phase transitions will follow if the dobrushin constant of the matrix , @xmath100 , is strictly less than @xmath101 .",
    "more precisely the following theorem was proved ( @xcite : theorem 2.5 ) .",
    "[ mainthm - lat ] suppose that @xmath18 is a gibbs measure associated with a lattice interaction @xmath13 with finite triple norm .",
    "suppose further that @xmath102",
    ". then the transformed measure @xmath32 is gibbsian and the transformed gibbsian specification @xmath103 has goodness @xmath104 , where    @xmath105    with @xmath106 .",
    "thus the transformed measure @xmath32 will be gibbsian if either the initial interaction @xmath13 is weak or the a priori measures @xmath95 are close to delta measures .",
    "furthermore , in the above theorem the goodness of the transformed specification is expressed in terms of the posterior metric @xmath81 .",
    "can one have local transformations where this metric could be expressed in terms of more familiar metrics on @xmath7 ? in what follows we present two examples where the above question will have a positive answer . to do this",
    "we pay a price of putting further restrictions on the class of allowed interactions for the initial system .",
    "let us equip @xmath7 with a metric @xmath60 .",
    "denote by @xmath107 the smallest constants such that the @xmath108-variation of the hamiltonian @xmath109 satisfies @xmath110 we say that @xmath97 satisfies a lipschitz property with constants @xmath111 , if all these constants are finite .    for this class of interactions",
    "it is not hard to see from that    @xmath112    this follows from replacing the @xmath113 in by @xmath114 .",
    "let us now see some concrete examples .      to a gibbs measure @xmath18 for a lattice interaction",

    "the inequality implies . but using gives a better bound on the dobrushin interdependence matrix . in we keep all the interactions a given site @xmath56 has with the rest of its environment , but in only the interaction between @xmath56 and a reference site @xmath108 is kept .",
    "note also that the entries of @xmath130 will be small if either the initial interaction is weak or @xmath131 is small enough .",
    "this is a generalization of the corresponding ising and planar rotor results found in @xcite to more general interactions on any @xmath0dimensional sphere , subjected to infinite - temperature diffusive dynamics .",
    "+   + the above theorem was proved in @xcite for some special pair interaction .",
    "the proof there followed from three steps , namely : 1 ) an application of theorem [ mainthm - lat ] to obtain continuity estimates in terms of the posterior metric @xmath81 , 2 ) a comparison result between @xmath81 and @xmath60 ( the euclidean metric ) , see e.g proposition 2.8 of @xcite and 3 ) a telescoping argument over sites in the conditioning .",
    "the first two steps hold for any general interaction on the sphere .",
    "+ in the third step one uses the continuity property to proceed . in particular",
    "one replaces the constant @xmath132 in inequality ( 100 ) of @xcite by @xmath133 .",
    "@xmath134    in the next subsection we consider another class of transformations which was studied in @xcite .",
    "consider a gibbs measure @xmath18 for an interaction @xmath13 satisfying .",
    "furthermore , partition @xmath7 into countably many pairwise disjoint subsets with non - zero @xmath8 measure , indexed by elements in a countable set @xmath52 .",
    "thus we have disjoint subsets @xmath135 , such that @xmath136 and @xmath137 for all @xmath138 . for each such decomposition of @xmath7",

    "the question now is : `` which of these maps will lead to a gibbsian image measure @xmath32 upon their application to the gibbs measure @xmath18 ? '' this question is partially answered in theorem 2.9 of @xcite , which we state below .",

    "thus for any strength of the initial interaction , the transformed measures will remain gibbsian if our decomposition is fine enough .",
    "we note that if we make a decomposition of the circle into equal intervals , the resulting models resembles a clock model . on could in fact also apply the theorem starting with discrte spins , such as a large-@xmath148 clock model , but the advantage of considering continuous spin spaces is that the theorem can always be applied ( in other words , there is _ always _ a fine enough decomposition ) .",
    "note also that such a discretisation map has strong similarities with fuzzification maps such as have been studied for potts models , see e.g. @xcite , in which one also decomposes the single - site spin space , into a smaller number of fuzzy spin values .",
    "this section deals with what is known about conservation , loss and recovery of the gibbs property in time - evolved gibbsian measures of vector models on the lattice @xmath149 .",
    "the conservation part will focus on large - time results , as the short - time results have been described in the previous section .",
    "we will concentrate here on the work done in @xcite .",
    "moreover we will present some new arguments which extend the results in @xcite .    in the previous section we defined gibbs measures , see equation , and furthermore we gave an equivalent description which we stated in equation .",
    "let us now focus on the latter expression .",
    "in words it says if a measure @xmath18 is gibbsian , every configuration @xmath25 is * good * , in the sense that for every @xmath25 the measure is + continuous w.r.t . a change in the conditioning .",
    "we referred to this property as the * quasilocality * property .",
    "but what does it mean for a measure @xmath18 to be _",
    "loss of gibbsianness means essentially the failure of this quasilocality property .",
    "it is enough to find at least one point of essential discontinuity @xmath150 w.r.t .",
    "the conditioning , namely a point satisfying @xmath151 for @xmath152 , uniformly in @xmath153 , to prove that a measure is non - gibbsian .",
    "physically the failure of quasilocality means the following : + the spin at the origin @xmath154 is influenced by far away configurations @xmath155 and @xmath156 even when the spins in between are frozen in the configuration @xmath157 . for a measure which is gibbsian ,",
    "the spin @xmath154 is shielded off from spins far away when intermediate spins are fixed .",
    "so there are no hidden fluctuations transmitting information from infinity to the origin .",
    "+ typically , in the analysis one considers a double - layer system with the initial spin space in the first layer and the transformed system ( or image - spin space ) in the second layer .",
    "the question of the gibbsianness of the measure on the second layer then can be shown to reduce to the question : is it possible to end up in this particular configuration coming from one initial gibbs measure only ?",
    "it turns out that if the original spin system * conditioned * on a particular image spin configuration @xmath150 exhibits a phase transition , this implies for @xmath158 that this measure is not gibbsian .",
    "the configuration @xmath150 is often called a * bad configuration*. we want to stress the difference between a phase transition of the initial system and a phase transition of the conditioned double - layer system . even if the initial system exhibits a phase transition and the time - evolved measure at time @xmath131 is a gibbs measure , it means that conditioned at every possible image spin configuration @xmath25 at time @xmath131 , there is no phase transition for the conditioned system . in other words , for every possible @xmath25 there is only one possible initial measure leading to this image spin configuration .",
    "hence , a phase transition of the initial system does not necessarily imply non - gibbsianness , nor does non - gibbsianness imply a phase transition for the initial measure .",
    "+ in the case of time - evolved xy - spins on the lattice @xmath5 , in @xcite and @xcite some results about conservation , loss and recovery of gibbsianness were proved . in @xcite results",
    "are proven for conservation and loss of gibbsianness during time - evolution .",
    "in particular , loss of gibbsianness could be proven for zero initial external fields .",
    "the paper @xcite deals with loss and recovery of gibbsianness in a situation where there is a positive initial external field . as we already discussed in the previous section",
    ", the gibbsian property is conserved for short times for all initial gibbs measures evolving under diffusive dynamics consisting of brownian motions on the circle , either with or without gradient hamiltonian drifts , at all temperatures ( for all values of @xmath1 and all values of the initial temperature @xmath2 ) .",
    "moreover , conservation for all times holds if the system starts with a high - or infinite - temperature gibbs measure and evolves under high- or infinite - temperature dynamics ( @xmath159 ) .",
    "+ let us make the statement on the loss of gibbsianness result from @xcite more precise .",
    "systems in @xmath160 are considered which start in a low - temperature initial measure with nearest neighbour interaction and zero external field , @xmath161 and evolve under independent brownian motion dynamics on the circle .",
    "then there is a time interval , depending on the initial ( inverse ) temperature , such that the time - evolved measure is not gibbsian .",
    "the idea of the proof is the following .",
    "consider the double - layer measure and condition it on the alternating north - south configuration .",
    "the ground states of the conditioned system then are two symmetric configurations of spins pointing either to the east with a small correction @xmath162 or to the west with a small correction .",
    "let us give a schematic picture .",
    "west - pointing ground state    east - pointing ground state    the potential of the conditioned model is of c - type ( nearest neighbour , invariant under reflection in vertical and horizontal direction and invariant under translation ) , so that the corresponding measure is reflection positive . using a percolation argument for low - energy clusters ( clusters of vertices connected by low - energy bonds ) from @xcite , in two dimensions",
    "one proves that at low temperatures there exist two distinct extremal gibbs measures for the thus - conditioned system .",
    "this implies that the conditioned double - layer system undergoes a phase transition via discrete symmetry breaking and therefore the time - evolved measure is not gibbsian .",
    "this phase transition is called of  spin - flop \" type .",
    "let us remark on a special feature of this result .",
    "in the ising spin case see @xcite , where one also finds at zero external field loss of gibbsianness , the initial system itself is already not unique .",
    "the xy spin model , however , does not have a first order phase transition in two dimensions .",
    "so even though starting from a unique gibbs measure , there is a time interval where gibbsianness is lost . +",
    "we also mention that the result can be extended to @xmath163 and arbitrary large times . in that case",
    "the initial measure is not unique , and there is long - range order for any strength of the alternating magnetic field , including zero .",
    "unfortunately , the techniques which are used rely on the reflection positivity property of the measure , and therefore can not be applied to a system which evolves with high - temperature dynamics , since then the conditioned measure is not reflection positive any more . also for higher - component spins the proof breaks down .",
    "+ for discrete spins , the authors in @xcite prove that loss of gibbsianness appears also for high - temperature dynamics , for rotor spins we believe the same is true but this has not yet been proven . by some pirogov - sinai type arguments",
    "one might hope to extend the above result to high - temperature dynamics .",
    "but this seems a technically hard question .",
    "+ in the presence of an initial external field @xmath164 loss and also recovery results were obtained in @xcite .",
