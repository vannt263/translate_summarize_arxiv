    "atomic - physics experiments were recently able to realize exotic many - body phases that simulate interesting states of condensed - matter systems  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to solid - state devices , whose parameters are determined by the properties of the material used for the fabrication , atomic quantum simulators are highly tunable .",
    "for example , by tuning the intensity of a laser it is possible to change the depth of the periodic lattice in which ultracold atoms move , and by applying a magnetic field it is possible to control the interactions among them  @xcite .",
    "some remarkable examples are the realization of the bose - hubbard model and its superfluid  mott - insulator transition  @xcite , the study of the bcs - bec crossover  @xcite , the realization of artificial gauge fields  @xcite , the realization of a fermionic mott insulator  @xcite , and the experimental detection of anderson localization  @xcite and many - body localization  @xcite with ultracold atoms .",
    "ultracold atoms additionally possess an exquisite isolation from the environment , which enables them to preserve quantum coherence for long times .",
    "thus , these systems are a natural playground to observe nonequilibrium effects associated with time - dependent many - body hamiltonians .",
    "examples of recent studies that explored the response to external time - dependent perturbations are given in refs .  .",
    "two common protocols are the sudden quench ( the evolution of the system following an abrupt change of the hamiltonian ) and the linear ramping ( the evolution of the system with a parameter varying linearly in time ) . in particular , if such a parameter is slowly varied across a second order quantum phase transition , many observables show a universal kibble - zurek scaling ( see refs .   for an introduction ) .    here",
    "we focus on a third type of time - dependent hamiltonians , namely periodic driving .",
    "previous studies focused in particular on the relaxation to an asymptotic state and its possible thermal properties  @xcite , as well as proposals for nonequilibrium quantum phase transitions @xcite with special interest on the preparation of floquet time - crystals  @xcite and symmetry - protected topological phases  @xcite .",
    "in particular , floquet topological insulators have been recently experimentally realized in optical waveguides  @xcite and acoustic crystals@xcite .",
    "these phases are analogous to the topological band insulators of noninteracting fermions , whose complete equilibrium classification is given by a known mathematical theory , the k - theory ( see ref .",
    "for an introduction ) . by definition , topological phases do not possess any local order parameter .",
    "nevertheless , in one - dimension these phases are often characterized by nonlocal string orders .",
    "nonlocal orders account for correlations between spins that are not detected by a simple two - point correlation function , and reveal the presence of a hidden order parameter . in particular ,",
    "string orders were discussed in the context of the haldane gapped phase of integer - spin chains  @xcite , but are in fact ubiquitous in one - dimensional insulators .",
    "they appear for example in spin-@xmath0 chain with next - nearest - neighbor interactions@xcite and even in the trivial phase of the one - dimensional bose - hubbard model @xcite .",
    "the interest in the behavior of the string order in nonequilibrium situations was risen by ref .  , where it was shown that sudden external perturbations can destroy the string order of spin-1 chains . in the context of floquet systems , ref .",
    "considered a time - periodic hamiltonian whose high - frequency expansion corresponds to the cluster - ising model of ref .   and displays a string order . in the same spirit , by constructing an effective hamiltonian in the high - frequency limit , ref .   found a string order in a fermi - hubbard model with long - range interactions undergoing a periodic driving .",
    "furthermore , ref .   considered disordered systems in the many - body localized phase and found that all the eigenstates undergo a transition from a paramagnetic phase to a spin - glass phase with a nonvanishing string - order parameter .        [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     we find that the number of edge states @xmath1 is time - independent and constant within each phase , confirming its topological nature .",
    "as mentioned above , in contrast to equilibrium topological insulators , in floquet topological phases edge states can occur both in the center of the floquet band , @xmath2 , and at its edge , @xmath3 , ( see also refs .  ) .",
    "we empirically find that both @xmath4 and @xmath5 do not depend on the driving amplitude @xmath6 , and are unchanged on each of the six vertical strips of the phase diagram of fig .",

    "this empirical rule is only broken in the strip @xmath7 : in this frequency domain , @xmath8 for @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and @xmath11 for @xmath12 .",
    "this point deserves further investigation .",
    "in particular we will need to clarify whether the maximal system - size considered in our calculations , @xmath13 , is sufficient to reach the thermodynamic regime of the small intermediate phase ( whose gap is small and correlation length very long ) .",
    "the number of edge states in each frequency domain is summarized in table [ tab : edgemodes ] and agrees with the arguments of ref .  .",
    "in particular , @xmath14 in the high - frequency phase , which is adiabatically connected to the static paramagnet . with decreasing frequency , @xmath1 increases by one at the resonances of the @xmath15 series ( @xmath16 ) and decreases by one at the @xmath17 series ( @xmath18 )  @xcite .",
    "the frequency of the added ( subtracted ) edge state depends on the parity of the @xmath15 ( @xmath17 ) index : @xmath4 increases ( decreases ) at even @xmath15s ( @xmath17s ) , and @xmath5 increases ( decreases ) at odd @xmath15s ( @xmath17s ) . a graphical representation of this result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : edgemodes ] .",
    "we now comment on the relation between the number of edge states @xmath1 and the winding number @xmath19 .",
    "an inspection of table  [ tab : edgemodes ] reveals that the parity of these two quantities is always equal .",
    "this result can be rationalized by observing that ( i ) @xmath20 in the trivial high - frequency phase , ( ii ) their parities change sign when crossing the vertical lines of fig .",
    "[ diag_fase : fig ] , and ( iii ) remain unchanged when crossing its horizontal lines . we further observe that although @xmath1 does not uniquely define @xmath19 , all observed phases satisfy @xmath21 . at present",

    ": red dotted lines represent odd @xmath23s , and blue dashed lines represent even @xmath23s .",
    "the intersections of the diagonal lines and the upper edge of the band correspond to the @xmath15-series resonances ( @xmath24 ) , and the intersections with the lower edge of the band correspond to the @xmath17-series resonances ( @xmath25 ) . for a given frequency @xmath26 ,",
    "the number of red dotted ( blue dashed ) lines inside the gray area is equal to @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) . ]",
    "from an experimental perspective , it is necessary to specify a protocol to prepare the floquet ground state .",
    "one possibility would be to prepare the ground state of the time - averaged hamiltonian at high frequency and then reach the fgs by adiabatically lowering the frequency  @xcite .",
    "this is possible if no resonance in the floquet spectrum is met  @xcite .",
    "but if we want to prepare , for instance , a fgs with @xmath27 starting from infinite frequency , we have to cross a resonance ( the one at @xmath28 ) . in crossing a resonance ,",
    "the adiabatic theorem does not apply and it is not possible to exactly prepare the fgs .",
    "in fact , one can show that the order parameter remains exactly zero across the transition .",
    "nevertheless , if we change our hamiltonian very slowly , we can obtain a state with an arbitrary long correlation length but never infinite .",
    "we numerically estimate the @xmath29 correlation length as @xmath30 where we choose @xmath31 so that the sum has already reached convergence .",
    "we ramp the frequency in time as @xmath32 we take @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 ; @xmath37 is the characteristic time scale of the ramping .",
    "we ramp the system from a phase with order @xmath38 to a phase with order @xmath29 at the time - reversal invariant point @xmath39 ( see fig .",
    "[ diag_fase : fig ] ) . the driving with linearly",
    "changing frequency is a square wave of the form @xmath40 with @xmath41 : the crossing of the resonance occurs when @xmath42 .",
    "we probe the system at times @xmath43 such that @xmath44 ; in this way we can make comparison with the system at the time reversal invariant point @xmath39  @xcite . because this protocol breaks the time reversal invariance , the majorana correlator eq .",
    "is nonvanishing and we need to use the general formula involving the pfaffian to evaluate the correlator ( see sec .  [ parametra : sec ] ) .    in analogy to the standard kibble - zurek phenomenon  @xcite , we find that the correlation length at the end of the ramping , @xmath45 , scales polynomially with @xmath37 : @xmath46 .",
    "we show this scaling in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ inlen1:fig ] by means of a bilogarithmic plot .",
    "we find that the steepness of the curve @xmath47 versus @xmath48 is an increasing function which saturates to an asymptotic value when @xmath49 . by means of a linear fit of this curve in the region of large @xmath37",
    "we numerically find @xmath50 with @xmath51 . in our numerical calculations @xmath52 and the steepness",
    "has reached a satisfying convergence : our result is consistent with @xmath53 , in agreement with the scaling of the defect density found in ref .  , @xmath54 .",
    "in the lower panel of the figure we plot the correlator @xmath55 versus @xmath56 rescaled by @xmath57 : we see that all the rescaled curves have the same decay length and this confirms the scaling of @xmath45 with @xmath57 .",
    "c +    an alternative method to prepare the system in a nontrivial fgs is to fix the frequency and adiabatically increase the amplitude of the driving : @xmath58 . in this case",
    "we probe the correlators at times @xmath59 , with @xmath23 integer .",
    "we set @xmath60 and @xmath36 and perform an adiabatic ramp inside a phase with order parameter @xmath61 ( see fig .",
    "[ diag_fase : fig ] ) .",
    "note that in this case our starting point ( @xmath62 ) is a critical point of the floquet spectrum where the floquet gap is closed . as a consequence , the validity of the adiabatic theorem",
    "is not guaranteed @xcite .",
    "we nevertheless find a very clear scaling of the correlation length , as in the standard crossing of the quantum critical point : actually the correlation length behaves as a scaling function : @xmath63 ( see fig .  [ inlen2:fig ] ) .",
    "in this work we have studied the phase diagram of the floquet ground state of a periodically driven integrable quantum spin chain .",
    "its quantum phase transitions occur at well - defined resonances in the floquet spectrum , whose position is here approximated by analytical expressions and confirmed by numerically - exact calculations .",
    "thanks to the jordan - wigner transformation , the problem can be mapped to a chain of non - interacting fermions . in the case of time - reversal invariant protocols , this fermionic model includes an infinite number of distinct topological phases , characterized by a topological winding number  @xcite . here",
    "we show that in the original spin representation the phases can be characterized by a set of local and nonlocal ( string ) order parameters , such that a single nonvanishing long - ranged order corresponds to each phase . at present , were able to determine the order parameters for all the phases with winding numbers @xmath64 .",
    "in particular , the phase with @xmath65 is characterized by a previously unnoticed string order parameter , @xmath66 , introduced in eq .",
    "( [ obeta : eqn ] ) . based on our findings , we conjecture that phases with odd ( even ) winding numbers are characterized by local ( nonlocal ) order parameters of increasing complexity . we have furthermore showed some cases where the correlation length associated to the order parameter shows a kibble - zurek scaling when slowly crossing one of the non - equilibrium quantum phase transitions .    the floquet quantum phases are additionally characterized by the number of edge states at quasi - energies @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "although the parity of the number of edge states , @xmath1 corresponds to the parity of the winding number @xmath19 ( given by the @xmath69 topological invariant @xmath70 ) , these two quantities are actually independent quantum numbers ( see table [ tab : edgemodes ] ) .",
    "we empirically observe that @xmath71 , in contrast to the static cases , where @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the number of protected edge states is invariant in time , while both the fermionic and the bosonic order parameters , are uniquely defined at time - reversal - invariant points .",
    "our work raises fundamental questions about the classification of topological phases in periodically driven one - dimensional fermionic systems , and in particular about the relation between winding numbers and edge states .",
    "it additionally highlights the nontrivial relation between these topological quantities and the local and nonlocal orders of the unitarily equivalent spin model .",
    "perspectives of future work concern the study of the phase diagram in the disordered driven system , especially in connection with topological properties ( quantum phase transitions in the static disordered system are already well known  @xcite ) . considering also terms that break integrability , it would be interesting to study the existence of topological order in all the eigenstates of the dynamics in case of many body localization  @xcite .",
