    "given several independent genomic data sets which address a similar question , it is common to compare the lists of the top - ranked genes from each study .",
    "genes selected as highly ranked in multiple studies may be considered validated or replicated .",
    "curated databases of gene lists are available which include tools for comparing lists and intersecting lists of top - ranked genes across multiple similar studies [ @xcite , @xcite ] .",
    "the `` correspondence at the top '' concordance statistic is an example of this approach @xcite . perhaps the most well known example is the study by tomlins et al . of gene expression in solid tumors ,",
    "@xcite which compared the top 10 genes from each of 132 cancer studies in a publicly available microarray data repository . within each study , the genes were ranked according to a statistic scoring potential `` fusion gene '' properties , as such fusion genes are known to be important drivers of malignancy in several hematologic cancers .",
    "tomlins et al .",
    "targeted a candidate gene list of 300 known cancer genes ; any candidate gene which ranked among the top 10 in _ two _ or more of the studies was considered to be a potential hit .",
    "two significant genes were found , one which ranked among the top 10 in two different studies and another in five studies .",
    "for these two genes , a fusion product was subsequently experimentally confirmed in prostate cancer and these remain the only common fusion transcripts discovered in an epithelial tumor .    in this paper",
    "we show how to conduct such an intersection - of - lists approach to assessing significance while controlling type i error ( at the set level ) and false discovery rate ( at the gene level ) . given @xmath1 independent studies ,",
    "there are two parameters which define a `` hit '' : the rank threshold ,  @xmath2 , above which a gene must lie in each study ( @xmath3 in the tomlins example ) , and the number of lists , @xmath4 , among which a gene must be ranked ( @xmath5 in the tomlins example ) in order to be declared significant .",
    "our first goal is to define an exact @xmath0-value which is easy to compute , when assessing the intersection of @xmath4 lists of top - ranked genes , at rank @xmath6 or above .",
    "this entails defining an appropriate test statistic and corresponding hypothesis test , which we call a  list - intersection discovery test , as this is an `` unsupervised '' or discovery approach .",
    "we apply these ideas to the related `` supervised '' case of an a  priori candidate gene list which is compared against @xmath1 other independent studies , as in @xcite . here",
    "the aim is to validate the genes appearing in the researcher s a priori list with a formal test of hypothesis .",
    "following @xcite , we call this a list - intersection concordance test",
    ". we then develop practical guidelines for choices of  @xmath2 and  @xmath4 which maximize the expected sensitivity at a given false discovery rate ( fdr ) , that is , which maximize the expected proportion of true - positive genes that are declared to be significant at a given fdr .",
    "we give example applications of both the discovery and concordance test using data from the tomlins study .",
    "to state the discovery problem more precisely , consider data from @xmath1 independent ( gene - expression ) studies . within each study , suppose @xmath7 genes are independent and are ranked according to a statistic , and consider the list of the @xmath6 top - ranked genes in each study .",
    "the set of genes which lie in the intersection of @xmath4 or more of these lists , @xmath8 , are those genes `` recaptured '' as significant at least @xmath4 times across @xmath1 independent studies .",
    "however , the degree of confidence in this validation remains to be assessed .",
    "for example , considering @xmath9 independent studies , each with @xmath10 possible genes , it may be very likely that by chance alone at least 50 genes would be recaptured among the top @xmath11 genes in @xmath12 or more studies ( as we shall demonstrate , probability @xmath13 ) , somewhat likely that 5 or more genes would be so recaptured across @xmath14 studies ( probability @xmath15 ) , and very unlikely that any one gene would be recaptured in @xmath16 out of 6 studies just by chance ( probability @xmath17 ) . in this paper",
    "we show how to compute these probabilities ( these examples are computed in section [ example1 ] ) , how to assess the statistical significance of the recaptured set for given @xmath6 and @xmath4 , and how to estimate the false discovery rate within the recaptured set .",
    "the test statistic we use is @xmath18 , the size of the intersection set ; in the above three examples @xmath19 , 5 and 1 , respectively . in making these computations",
    "we have assumed the genes behave independently , which is no doubt not true in practice , and this is addressed theoretically and in simulations in the last section of the paper .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ seccrstat ] we derive the distribution of the list - intersection test statistic under the null hypothesis and show how to compute a @xmath0-value for a gene - set and how to estimate the within - set false discovery rate ( fdr ) . in section [ secconcordance ]",
    "we derive the distribution of the list - intersection concordance test statistic . in section [ tomex ]",
    "we apply the test to data in @xcite . in section [ design ]",
    "we discuss how to control the type i error of the discovered set , and how to control the false discovery rate of the genes within the discovered set .",
    "we give a strategy for finding good choices of @xmath6 and @xmath4 ( section [ secbonferroni ] ) . in section [ secexample ]",
    "we give an example of how to mine a data repository for a `` statistically significant '' discovered gene set while controlling the type i error at the set level and the within - set fdr .",
    "section [ conclusion ] addresses what happens if independence on genes does not hold , and then gives conclusions and future directions .",
    "simulation studies , code , and additional proofs are described in the supplemental article [ @xcite ] .",
    "the list - intersection test compares the top - ranked gene lists from multiple studies in order to discover a common significant set of genes .",
    "suppose we consider @xmath1 studies , each of which investigate @xmath7 genes , and that the genes within a study are ranked according to a prespecified scoring procedure which might be fold change , a between group t - test , or might differ from study to study .",

    "we show that @xmath21 has an approximately poisson distribution under the assumptions the genes within a study are independent , and that @xmath22 and @xmath23 where both @xmath7 and @xmath6 are large , and use this to compute a @xmath0-value .      for an arbitrary gene @xmath25 ,",

    "while the bernoulli trials @xmath30 are not independent even under the assumption of independent genes ( given that one gene lies among the top @xmath2 genes , the next gene is less likely to do so ) , they are identically distributed , and so it is immediate that @xmath31    to evaluate @xmath29 under the null hypothesis of random ranking among @xmath7 genes in each study , index the studies from @xmath32 to @xmath33 and again consider an arbitrary gene  @xmath25 .",
    "let @xmath34 be the bernoulli trial that counts a success if  @xmath25 ranks among the top @xmath2 genes in study @xmath35 , with @xmath36 . under the null hypothesis , @xmath37 , and",

    "then @xmath39 , and the probability  @xmath40 that gene @xmath25 is listed among the top @xmath6 genes in @xmath4 or more studies is given by @xmath41 an easily computed binomial probability .",
    "using ( [ esn ] ) and ( [ p0 ] ) , one may then estimate the within - set fdr by comparing the expected number of discoveries under the null hypothesis to the total number of discoveries made : @xmath42 /|s_n| .",

    "note that for large @xmath7 with @xmath43 , selection of the @xmath6 top - ranked genes within a study has nearly the same distribution as random sampling with replacement . if , in addition , , then @xmath30 and @xmath44 are approximately independent for any pair of genes  @xmath25 and  @xmath45 . in this case",
    "@xmath21 will have an approximate binomial distribution with parameters  @xmath7 and  @xmath29 .",
    "if , in addition , @xmath7 is large and @xmath29 small , it follows that the distribution of @xmath21 is approximately poisson with mean @xmath46 .",
    "we consider the effects of correlation between genes in section  [ seccorr ] .      here",
    "we show how to use ( [ esn ] ) and ( [ p0 ] ) to compute the expected number of genes recaptured just by chance , as well as the @xmath0-value of the size of the recaptured set and the estimated fdr for genes within the set .",
    "these quantities depend on the total number of studies considered , @xmath1 , the depth of the top - ranked list , @xmath2 , and the number of lists intersected , @xmath4 . throughout",
    "we let @xmath47 .",
    "we also investigate the quality of the binomial and poisson approximations for these examples :    as in the , consider that we have ranked @xmath47 genes , and that the top @xmath11 genes are the top - ranked set .",
    "then , under the null hypothesis of independent random ranking , @xmath48 . from  ( [ p0 ] ) , given @xmath49 studies to compare , the probability of seeing a given gene in the top 200 from @xmath5 or more studies is @xmath50 .",
    "it follows from  ( [ esn ] ) that @xmath51 , the number of genes captured in 2 or more studies , is then approximately poisson with mean @xmath52 .    to evaluate the accuracy of @xmath0-values computed from this poisson approximation , note that two of the three key assumptions , that @xmath53 and @xmath54 be small , are met .",
    "however , @xmath55 , so that @xmath56 is not particularly small compared to  @xmath2 . suppose the observed value of @xmath57 .",
    "then , from simulation under the null hypothesis of random ranking , @xmath58 , compared to the corresponding poisson @xmath0-value of @xmath13 , yielding a  relative error of @xmath59 .",
    "further examples show the simulated 95th percentile of the null distribution is 68 , while the poisson approximation gives  70 ( relative error , @xmath60 ) . at 1% significance level ,",
    "the relative error is 2.7% ( simulated value 73 ; poisson approximation  75 ) .",
    "thus , the poisson approximation appears to work well in this case .",
    "continuing the example , if we require the genes to be recaptured in three or more studies ( so that @xmath14 rather than 2 ) , the mean number of genes captured under the null is only 1.53 . as in the",
    ", suppose the observed value of @xmath61 . under the null hypothesis of random ranking the probability that 5 or more genes would be in the intersection list",
    "is @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is poisson with mean 1.53 .",
    "thus , we would have seen a statistically significant event with a @xmath0-value of 0.02 .",
    "the estimated within - set fdr would be @xmath64 , or 31% .",
    "note that from simulation , @xmath65 , again demonstrating the adequacy of the poisson approximation .",
    "now suppose only @xmath66 rather than @xmath67 total studies are considered , and @xmath5 as before .",
    "then the expected number of genes captured by chance falls by half , to a mean of 23 genes .",
    "again the relative error of the 95th and 99th percentiles of @xmath51 from the poisson approximation is @xmath68 ( the simulated 95th percentile of the null distribution is 31 , while the poisson approximation gives 32 ; the simulated 99th percentile is  34 , while the poisson approximation gives 35 ) .",
    "when @xmath9 but the depth of the list is halved so that only the top @xmath69 genes are considered , the mean number of genes captured by chance falls by @xmath70 , from 57 to 15 .",
    "the relative approximation error of the poisson distribution is 0% for the 95th percentile , and 4% for the 99th percentile .",
    "these examples show how to use the poisson approximation to the distribution of @xmath71 to calculate @xmath0-values and fdrs . over the range of parameters considered here",
    ", the poisson approximation appears to be very good .",
    "additional simulations are reported in section [ secexample ] and section 1.1 of the supplemental article [ @xcite ] .",
    "the concordance test evaluates whether an a priori candidate list of @xmath72 genes , say , from the researcher s new study , is significantly reproduced among the top @xmath2 genes in @xmath1 independent ranked lists of genes , say , from other experiments or from the literature .",
    "suppose each study investigates @xmath7 genes and consider the set of genes , @xmath73 , from the a priori candidate list which also lie in @xmath4 or more of these top - ranked lists .",
    "as before , we show that @xmath74 has an approximately poisson distribution under the null hypothesis of independent random ranking of the genes , however , with a different mean , under the assumptions that @xmath75 and @xmath76 and both @xmath7 and @xmath6 are large .      again , index the studies from @xmath32 to  @xmath1 .",

    "we apply these computations to the data from @xcite .",
    "they considered the cancer gene census [ @xcite ] published list of 300 genes known to be involved in cancer , and compared this candidate gene list across 132 studies from the oncomine [ @xcite ] repository of microarray data . within each study",
    ", they ranked all genes according to a score characteristic of a fusion gene .",
    "they then looked for the occurrence of any candidate cancer genes among the 10 top - ranked genes in each study , and for each cancer gene , reported how many times it was `` captured '' in a top-10 list . to define parameters ,",
    "each microarray platform interrogated about 10,000 expressed genes .",
    "thus , we have @xmath47 genes across @xmath85 studies , with the top @xmath86 genes considered from each study .",
    "the length of the a priori list is @xmath87 .",

    "these results are given in table [ tom ] , in the row labeled @xmath95 .",
    "we give the set of actual genes found by tomlins et al .",
    "in the intersection of @xmath4 or more lists ( the observed set @xmath91 ) , taken from their supplementary table s1 .",
    "we also record the count of cancer genes recaptured @xmath4 or more times ( the observed count @xmath96 ) .",
    "we then compute the @xmath0-value for each value of @xmath4 , computed as the probability that a poisson variate with the given mean would lie above the observed value of @xmath96 , and the estimated fdr within each recaptured set .",
    "notably , the observed set of cancer genes which is in the intersection of 2 or more lists , the set considered by tomlins et al . , has a @xmath0-value of 0.25 , indicating it is plausible that this many genes would reappear just by chance .",
    "four genes were `` discovered '' in this recaptured set , while the expected number recaptured under the null is 2.5 for an estimated fdr of @xmath97 or 63% .",
    "however , the @xmath0-values attached to the single gene erg , which reappears in 5 studies , is highly significant .",
    "both erg and the related etv1 were subsequently validated as fusion genes .",
    "this example illustrates how to compute the @xmath0-value for the size of an observed set of concordant genes .",
    "however , notice that multiple @xmath0-values are presented in table [ tom ] , corresponding to multiple choices of @xmath2 and @xmath4 .",
    "unless we specify @xmath2 and @xmath4 in advance , we are open to charges of data snooping , that is , of tailoring the choice of @xmath2 and @xmath4 to the results they yield in a given data set , rendering the nominal @xmath0-values invalid .",
    "thus , this example also highlights the need for a strategy for choosing @xmath2 and @xmath4 , and , importantly , the need to specify the choice of @xmath2 and @xmath4 before the analysis is carried out .",
    "we discuss these issues in the remainder of the paper .",
    "for a given prespecified choice of @xmath2 and @xmath4 , the list - intersection test will declare a gene set to be significant only if @xmath24 [ or @xmath98 has a @xmath0-value below the stated significance level @xmath99 .",
    "this procedure will strictly control the type i error rate ; that is , under the null model , the probability will be at least @xmath100 that no gene set will be declared to be significant .",
    "given a statistically significant gene set , it remains to investigate the fdr within set , and the expected proportion of true positive genes that are captured ( the expected sensitivity ) .",
    "importantly , as noted above , control of type i error requires both @xmath4 and @xmath2 to be specified in advance .",
    "for example , there may be several sets @xmath71 with @xmath0-values falling below any given significance level , and post hoc selection of one or more of these sets without correction for multiple testing would of course leave both the type i error and the set - level fdr uncontrolled .",
    "in addition , failure to prespecify @xmath2 and @xmath4 is likely to lead to data snooping , in which the chosen @xmath2 and @xmath4 are consciously or unconsciously tailored to yield the most `` interesting '' set of selected genes .",
    "thus , it remains to consider how to make good a priori choices of @xmath2 and @xmath4 . in this section , we give an example which illustrates how good choices of @xmath2 and @xmath4 may depend on which particular alternative hypothesis holds , and then propose a general design strategy .",
    "we leave as future work discussion of the more computationally and mathematically involved data - driven strategies to control the fdr .",
    "different choices of the threshold @xmath6 and the recapture rate @xmath4 will trade off between an increased false discovery rate within the set @xmath71 and increased power to capture any truly positive genes . for example , for fixed @xmath4 , as @xmath2 increases and more genes are included in the set of `` top-@xmath2 '' genes , any truly significant genes ( `` true positives '' ) will be more likely to be selected within each study and thus more likely to land in the intersection set @xmath71 .",
    "however , at the same time more null genes will be captured , thereby potentially increasing the fdr within @xmath71 , and possibly reducing power to call @xmath71 a statistically significant set .",
    "good choices for  @xmath2 and  @xmath4 will evidently depend on how many truly positive genes exist , as well as the effect size for each , as the latter determines the probability that a given positive gene rises to the top of the list .",

    ", we computed the expected number of null and significant genes recaptured by the list - intersection statistic . the mathematical argument for these expectations uses an argument from @xcite and is given in the supplement ( section 2 ) [ @xcite ] . for our two chosen scenarios , and",
    "for given @xmath2 and @xmath4 , table [ fdr ] displays the fdr within the intersection gene set as well as the expected sensitivity ( the expected proportion of true - positive genes that are captured ) .",

    "lowering @xmath6 further achieves a lower fdr , but at the cost of lower expected sensitivity : with @xmath5 as @xmath116 decreases from 50 to 10 , the expected sensitivity decreases from 84% to 36% .",
    "a better trade - off would be to require a larger recapture rate with @xmath117 while maintaining @xmath118 , as this combination maintains a sensitivity of 95.6% ( @xmath119 out of 25 ) while reducing false discoveries ( @xmath120 and @xmath121% ) .",

    "how to adjust for correlation between genes in the analysis of gene expression studies is an active area of research [ @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ] .",
    "here we give some quantitative guidance in the current setting , using simulation and by considering theoretical cases of extreme dependence .",
    "more detailed analysis will be the subject of future work .",
    "first , it is easy to see that negative correlation between genes may be generally expected to reduce , and positive correlation to increase , @xmath0-values as compared to the independent case .",
    "this is because correlation between genes will induce correlation between the bernoulli trials @xmath30 in ( [ distsn ] ) .",
    "the variance of the sum will be correspondingly decreased or increased with the mean remaining unchanged , rendering the distribution of @xmath24 either more or less concentrated about its mean .",
    "it thus is most important to consider the effect of positive correlation between genes because this will potentially increase @xmath0-values and thus type i error , if @xmath0-values are computed under the ( incorrect ) assumption of independence .",
    "the magnitude of the perturbation to @xmath0-values clearly depends on both the number of correlated genes and the strength of their correlation , while the exact perturbation depends on the joint distribution of the correlated genes .",
    "simulation studies reported in the supplemental article ( section 1.2 ) [ @xcite ] show that moderate correlation ( half of genes with weak correlation or a  few genes with strong correlation ) does not appear to appreciably affect @xmath0-values .",
    "further support for these observations is found in the literature on models for correlated bernoulli trials , of which [ @xcite , @xcite ] give relevant examples",
    ".    quantitative insight on the potential magnitude of a perturbation can be gained by considering the following extreme model : suppose the @xmath7 genes can be partitioned into modules of size @xmath72 , where two genes within a module have correlation @xmath207 but any two genes in different modules are independent . in the limiting case with @xmath208 , it is easy to see that @xmath24 has the same null distribution as the statistic @xmath209 , where the distribution of @xmath210 is computed using @xmath211 independent genes , and is thus approximately poisson with mean @xmath212 .",
    "it follows that , under this model , @xmath213 has unchanged mean , variance inflated by a factor of @xmath72 , and that corrected probabilities can be computed using the relation @xmath214 as the postulated within - module correlation decreases from @xmath208 toward zero , the correct tail probabilities will smoothly interpolate from the correction given in ( [ eqcorr ] ) to the original values as computed in section [ secnull ] under independence .",
    "thus , given correlated gene modules of postulated maximum size @xmath72 , relation ( [ eqcorr ] ) might be used to give a conservative ballpark correction to computed @xmath0-values .",
    "an example can be computed using the data in table [ ex ] , section [ secexample ] .",
    "for example , four genes were recaptured by @xmath215 ( line 1 of table [ ex ] ) , which had a @xmath0-value of 0.0006 under the null hypothesis of independent random ranking of genes .",
    "suppose we wondered if correlation under the null hypothesis would be sufficient to account for the observed data .",
    "after consideration , suppose we decided there were several pairs of strongly correlated genes , so that we wanted to conservatively adjust for many correlated gene modules of size 2 , so @xmath216 .",
    "as before , @xmath217 and @xmath218 , so that under independence @xmath219 is approximately poisson with mean @xmath220 . however , under the correlated model with @xmath208 , @xmath219 is distributed as @xmath221 , where @xmath222 is approximately poisson with mean @xmath223 .",
    "the @xmath0-value adjusted for correlation would be @xmath224 .",
    "thus , the maximum correlation assuming pair - wise modules would be unable to completely account for the observed data .",
    "several simulation examples showing the effect of other correlation structures are presented in the supplement [ @xcite ] .",
    "public repositories of genomic data continue to grow , and list - intersection approaches similar to those considered here are likely to become even more common in the future , as several repositories of curated gene lists have recently been published which include tools for comparing lists and intersecting lists of top - ranked genes across multiple similar studies [ @xcite , @xcite ] .",
    "the primary statistical challenges for analyzing data from such repositories are controlling the number of false positive results and maintaining a valid basis for inference when combining multiple studies [ @xcite ] .",

    "our approach compares within - study ranks to a common threshold , and is an effort to explore the inferential basis of the list - intersection approach .",
    "we provide exact formulas which allow examination of power and false discovery rates .",
    "our rank - threshold method does not combine individual per - gene effect sizes , such as ranks , across multiple studies .",
    "instead , we evaluate the entire set of genes recaptured as above a rank threshold across multiple studies . loosely speaking ,",
    "this is akin to acceptance sampling procedures , where a `` lot '' [ i.e. , the set @xmath71 in our notation ] may be deemed `` acceptable '' if the number of `` defectives '' ( i.e. , false discoveries ) is below some level ( defined by the fdr ) .",
    "however , a salient point in our setup is that many `` lots '' [ @xmath71 ] may be acceptable , in that they satisfy the fdr criteria .",
    "how to choose among these multiple `` acceptable '' gene - sets is a a major focus of our work .",
    "we discuss expected sensitivity of the gene - sets , and also obtain a @xmath0-value per recaptured set , with tight control of the set - wise type i error rate . in this sense",
    "our method is more stringent than an approach which combines gene - by - gene effect sizes across studies .",
    "our set - based method may also provide tighter control of gene - level type i error and false discovery rates , although this is the subject of future research .    in related work [ @xcite ]",
    ", a pooled @xmath0-value is calculated together with a _ consensus parameter _ defined as the number of studies in which a feature has to be declared significant before it is considered significantly validated across studies .",

    "@xcite describe results for different values of such consensus parameters but do not give guidelines on how to choose this parameter .",
    "our work provides the applied practitioner with @xmath0-values and expected number of false positives under various choices for within - study significance thresholds @xmath2 and recapture rates  @xmath4 , which could be used to guide decisions on significant `` gene - sets . ''",
    "another method , the partial conjunction hypothesis test [ @xcite ] , uses a @xmath0-value threshold to consider among how many studies out of @xmath1 a given gene is found to be significant at a given level , where each study addresses a different research hypothesis . for each gene",
    "@xmath25 , the set of hypotheses that the gene is null in @xmath4 or fewer studies is simultaneously tested , for @xmath226 .",
    "a general data - driven method for controlling the fdr across all genes is presented , where the number of false discoveries is defined as the number of genes which have been called significant in at least one study in which the gene was truly null . in this",
    "setting the studies may address differing alternative hypotheses , and the focus is on the situation where a gene can be truly null in some but not other studies , and where this may differ from gene to gene .",
    "thus , it is of interest to ascertain for each gene in which studies among all @xmath1 considered it is truly significant .",
    "this differs from the scenario considered in the present paper , in which the studies are assumed to each test the same hypothesis . in the setting of benjamini et al .",
    "power necessarily declines as the total number of studies @xmath1 increases [ @xcite ] .",
    "this is in contrast to our figure [ figdesign ] , in which the expected sensitivity increases with the total number of studies  @xmath1 .",

    "have the advantage , however , of controlling the false discovery rate in a data - driven manner .",
    "by contrast , we allow the user to set the number of studies @xmath4 that a gene is required to be captured by , and we study how the expected true positive proportion and false discovery rates are affected by which alternative is considered to hold .",

    "our focus is on external validation .",
    "we aim to provide a formal statistical method for evaluating genes that replicate across multiple studies .",
    "we discuss how one might a priori choose within - study significance thresholds ( i.e. , @xmath6 ) and cross - study recapture rates ( i.e. , @xmath4 ) to ensure ( i ) adequate probability of capturing true positives , and ( ii ) low false discovery rate within the recaptured set , when designing a bioinformatic search across multiple genomic data sets . after",
    "this search is complete , our methods can be applied to obtain @xmath0-values for observed recaptured sets , although permutation tests could also be used to obtain @xmath0-values , while the bootstrap could be used to obtain distributions of test statistics .",
    "our approach has some limitations .",
    "we assume that the threshold @xmath6 for determining high - ranking genes is the same for all studies , as are the corresponding probabilities @xmath227 of selecting a null gene ( used in computing @xmath0-values ) and @xmath228 of selecting a differentially expressed gene ( used in computing the expected proportion of true positives for study design ) .",
    "these assumptions could be relaxed computationally , although the distributional calculations would lose their simple closed form solutions .",
    "often when comparing results across studies the technology used to generate the data will be similar , in which case requiring similar parameters across studies should not pose a serious problem .",
    "in fact , this assumption is analogous to the homogeneity test in meta - analysis where only studies with similar design , populations , and measurement methods are pooled .",
    "further , as with many methods in common use in the analysis of gene - expression data , our calculations assume that genes are independent , which is unlikely to be the case in practice , as discussed in section [ seccorr ] . as with any analysis of gene - expression data using microarrays , rna - seq , or other technologies",
    ", it is expected that results will be independently verified using different experimental methods .    in summary , in this article",
    "we describe a simple and rigorous inferential method for evaluating the consistency of results across multiple independent studies , using a combined type i error for discovery of a significant gene set , and an estimated fdr within the gene set .",
    "we show how to choose study parameters to maximize the expected number of significant genes that will be captured .",
    "future work will consider related approaches which are based on fdr control .",
    "the framework we describe for selecting a significant set of genes is used widely by biologists and bioinformaticians [ @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ] .",
