    "there are several generalizations of ricci curvature lower bounds to metric measure spaces that use optimal mass transportation .",
    "the definitions that have received the most attention are the @xmath6 definitions by sturm @xcite , and lott and villani @xcite . in the definitions the first number @xmath7 always refers to",
    "a lower bound on the ricci curvature and the second number @xmath8 $ ] refers to an upper bound on the dimension of the space . a less restrictive version of ricci curvature lower bounds , called the measure contraction property @xmath0 was studied by sturm @xcite , and by ohta @xcite .",
    "recently also a more restrictive class of definitions called the riemannian ricci curvature lower bounds @xmath9 have been considered @xcite .",
    "common to all these definitions is stability under the measured gromov - hausdorff convergence .",
    "however , with the @xmath6 and @xmath0 definitions this stability has sometimes been sacrificed by assuming the space to be nonbranching . for the @xmath9 definitions such extra assumption seems unnecessary .",
    "this can be seen from the fact that such spaces are already essentially nonbranching @xcite . for some time it was not clear if the nonbranching assumption was just a technical assumption that was made to simplify the proofs .",
    "this was the case for some of the results , like the local poincar inequalities @xcite .",
    "however , it was recently shown by the second named author that in order to obtain a local - to - global property for @xmath6 it is necessary to assume nonbranching @xcite .",
    "notice that , as our above discussion suggests , for the @xmath9 a nonbranching assumption is not needed for the local - to - global property @xcite .    in this paper we further study the necessity of the nonbranching assumption in the theory of ricci curvature lower bounds in metric measure spaces .",
    "this time we focus on geometric ( or topological ) rigidity results .",
    "more specifically , we look at two classical rigidity results from riemannian geometry .",
    "the first result is the cheeger - gromoll splitting theorem @xcite saying that a riemannian manifold @xmath10 with non - negative ricci curvature containing an infinite line - segment is isometric to @xmath11 where @xmath12 is again a riemannian manifold with non - negative ricci curvature .",
    "the second rigidity result is the cheng maximal diameter theorem @xcite stating that an @xmath13-dimensional riemannian manifold with ricci curvature bounded from below by @xmath14 and with diameter @xmath4 is necessarily the standard sphere @xmath15 .",
    "recall that , by the bonnet - meyers theorem , @xmath4 is the maximal possible diameter for an @xmath13-dimensional riemannian manifold with ricci curvature bounded from below by @xmath14 .",
    "both of the above mentioned rigidity results have been proven in the abstract setting of @xmath9 spaces .",
    "the cheeger - gromoll splitting theorem was generalized to @xmath16 spaces by gigli @xcite . using this generalization and by studying the metric cones over @xmath9 spaces the first named author recently generalized the cheng maximal diameter theorem to @xmath9 spaces @xcite .    now that we know that the rigidity results hold for @xmath9 spaces it is natural to ask if they hold for the less restrictive definitions @xmath6 and @xmath0",
    ". since @xmath6 spaces include nonriemannian finsler manifolds , it would be unreasonable to expect the cheeger - gromoll and cheng theorems to hold in the same sharp form as for the @xmath9 spaces .",
    "however , ohta has shown that topological versions of the rigidity results still hold in the finsler setting .",
    "indeed , he has proven a diffeomorphic splitting theorem for finsler manifolds of nonnegative weighted ricci curvature @xcite .",
    "ohta also proved in @xcite that in nonbranching @xmath0 spaces a maximal diameter theorem holds in the following topological form .",
    "[ thm : ohta ] let @xmath17 be a compact metric measure space satisfying the @xmath5 property for some @xmath18 and assume that there exist @xmath19 with @xmath20 such that @xmath21 then there exists a topological measure space @xmath22 such that @xmath23 is the spherical suspension of @xmath22 as a topological measure space .    here the _ cut locus",

    "is satisfied . in @xcite ohta",
    "asked if the topological maximal diameter result holds for @xmath0 spaces without the nonbranching assumption .",
    "we show that this is not the case .",
    "[ thm:2 ] there exists a compact geodesic metric measure space @xmath29 satisfying @xmath3 and @xmath30 . still the space is not a topological spherical suspension .    a slightly easier construction than the one showing the failure of the topological maximal diameter theorem shows that also topological splitting results fail for @xmath31 spaces .",
    "[ thm:1 ] there exists a complete geodesic metric measure space @xmath32 satisfying @xmath1 and containing an isometrically embedded copy of @xmath2 . still the space does not topologically split",
    ".    still several questions remain open between the positive results and the counter - examples stated in theorems [ thm:2 ] and [ thm:1 ] .",
    "two obvious questions are the following .",
    "[ q:1 ] does a topological maximal diameter theorem hold in @xmath6 spaces ?",
    "does a topological splitting theorem hold in @xmath33 spaces ?",
    "notice that there exist spaces satisfying @xmath6 with positive @xmath34 that contain lots of branching geodesics @xcite , so question [ q:1 ] does not have an obvious answer via theorem [ thm : ohta ] .",
    "these questions are also related to the local structure of spaces with different ricci curvature lower bounds .",
    "it is still unknown even for @xmath9 spaces if the hausdorff dimension or any other relevant dimension is constant almost everywhere .",
    "perhaps the currently best positive result in this direction is that @xmath9 spaces have euclidean weak tangents at almost every point @xcite .",
    "the examples of this paper show that the least restrictive definitions of ricci curvature lower bounds discussed here - the @xmath0 conditions - do not imply that the hausdorff ( or topological ) dimension of the space is almost everywhere constant .",
    "before defining the spaces mentioned in theorems [ thm:2 ] and [ thm:1 ] we recall some basics including the definition of @xmath0 and its connection to other definitions of ricci curvature lower bounds in metric measure spaces .",

    ", @xmath0 for short , if for every point @xmath25 and a measurable set @xmath55 with @xmath56 ( and @xmath57 is @xmath58 ) there exists a probability measure @xmath59 on @xmath39 such that    1 .",
    "we have @xmath60 and @xmath61 ; 2 .   for @xmath42 $ ]",
    ", @xmath62 holds as measures on @xmath63 .",
    "let us then briefly give the connection of the @xmath0 condition to other similar curvature - dimension bounds .",
    "the @xmath6 conditions by sturm @xcite and lott and villani @xcite use the same weights @xmath64 as @xmath0 but require a convexity type inequality between any two probability measures along some optimal transport geodesic",
    ". as shown by the second named author in @xcite , @xmath6 implies @xmath0 . there is also a more strict version of @xmath0 by sturm @xcite .",
    "he required the choice of geodesics be given by a markov kernel .",
    "it is not known if the @xmath6 conditions imply this more strict version of @xmath0 . in this paper",
    "we will work with the definition of ohta .",
    "changing slightly the weights @xmath64 to a more pde - friendly versions give rise to so - called reduced definitions that usually carry a @xmath65 in their abbreviation .",
    "the first set of reduced definitions , @xmath66 were considered by bacher and sturm in @xcite . in nonbranching spaces it was shown by cavalletti and sturm @xcite that @xmath66 actually implies @xmath0 . recently cavalletti has shown @xcite that in nonbranching spaces @xmath66 gives the required convexity - type inequalities for the @xmath6 condition for a much larger class of transports .",
    "it is still open if the @xmath66 really self - improves to @xmath6 .",
    "the most recent additions to the set of definitions are the riemannian ricci curvature lower bounds @xcite .",
    "these definitions start from the reduced weights and are therefore denoted by @xmath9 .",
    "as the word riemannian in the name of the condition suggests , the @xmath9 condition rules out nonriemannian finsler structures that the @xmath66 condition includes . as was noted in @xcite the @xmath9 conditions imply @xmath0 without the nonbranching assumption that was assumed in @xcite . as in the case of @xmath6",
    ", it is not known if @xmath9 self - improves to @xmath67 .",
    "there are also other curvature - dimension conditions besides the ones mentioned so far .",
    "one interesting notion is the coarse ricci curvature by ollivier @xcite . because by @xcite we know that @xmath0 spaces satisfy a bishop - gromov volume comparison theorem , the @xmath0 spaces ( and in particular our examples ) have a lower bound on the coarse ricci curvature associated to the @xmath68-step random walk , see @xcite",
    "we now turn to the examples stated in theorems [ thm:2 ] and [ thm:1 ] .",
    "they are both constructed as closed connected subsets of @xmath69 equipped with the distance @xmath70 coming from the @xmath71-norm , i.e. @xmath72    the first example we present here is a space satisfying @xmath1 .",
    "it is a tangent space of the second space satisfying @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , instead of proving the @xmath1 property , we could refer to this fact .",
    "( see section [ sec : remarks ] for more discussion . )",
    "we will still prove the @xmath1 property in the first example because it is simpler and makes it easier to understand the second example .",
    "let us start with the easier example of theorem [ thm:1 ] of a space @xmath32 satisfying @xmath1 containing an isometric embedding of the euclidean real - line . as a subset of @xmath69",
    "the space @xmath63 is defined as @xmath75 see figure [ fig : example1 ] for an illustration .",
    "the distance @xmath70 on the space is the @xmath71-distance .",
    "the measure @xmath76 restricted to the half - infinite line segment @xmath77 is @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the one - dimensional hausdorff measure . on the cone",
    "@xmath80 we define @xmath76 as a weighted lebesgue measure via @xmath81 in other words , the projection of @xmath76 to the first coordinate is the lebesgue measure @xmath82 and the measure @xmath76 is equally distributed in @xmath83 for all @xmath84 .",
    "let us then check that the space @xmath32 satisfies @xmath1 .",
    "we will always transport measure linearly in the horizontal direction .",
    "hence it is sufficient to check @xmath1 separately for sets @xmath85 with @xmath86 .",
    "there are several cases to check depending on the position of the measure @xmath87 and the coordinate @xmath86 .",
    "if @xmath91 , we can transport using a set of geodesics such that each image of a geodesic is a subset of a set of the form @xmath92 in other words , we first transport along a euclidean geodesic to the origin and then continue along @xmath93 . see the first case in figure [ fig : selection1 ] .",
    "then the induced optimal transport satisfies @xmath94.\\ ] ] compared to the previous case the first equality has now change to an inequality due to the fact that the density might drop when we pass through the origin .",
    "next we have to check the different cases when @xmath95 .",
    "let us first look at the easier case where @xmath96 .",
    "in this case we can again use euclidean geodesics .",
    "since the density of the reference measure @xmath76 with respect to @xmath97 is increasing in @xmath98 as @xmath27 increases , we have the estimate @xmath99.\\ ] ]    the final case is when @xmath100 . in this case we still have three subcases to select the geodesic(s ) from @xmath101 to a point @xmath89 . the division to subcases at @xmath102 is due to the fact that all geodesics from @xmath101 to @xmath103 have the same length .    in the subcase @xmath104",
    "we simply take the euclidean geodesic . in the subcase @xmath105",
    "we take a geodesic that first goes along the euclidean geodesic from @xmath101 to @xmath106 and then along the euclidean geodesic from @xmath106 to @xmath89 .",
    "see the second case in figure [ fig : selection1 ] .",
    "the third subcase is when @xmath107 . in this subcase",
    "we first spread the measure uniformly from @xmath101 to @xmath108 $ ] , then contract along the euclidean geodesics to the origin and then move to @xmath89 along the euclidean geodesic . see the third case in figure [ fig : selection1 ] .",
    "now in the case @xmath109 we have @xmath110.\\ ] ] in the case @xmath111 we have @xmath112\\ ] ] and @xmath113.\\ ] ] all cases now being checked we have shown that @xmath114 satisfies @xmath1 .",
    "one can check that the space also satisfies the convexity inequality of the @xmath33 condition for many transports .",
    "this is clearly the case for measures transported inside @xmath93 . for transports between @xmath98 and @xmath93",
    "this is less trivial , but still true .",
    "however , for transports in @xmath98 the @xmath33 condition ( in fact @xmath115 for any @xmath7 ) fails .",
    "the problematic transports are the ones going in the diagonal direction where one is forced to use euclidean geodesics . here",
    "the density change of the reference measure @xmath76 with respect to @xmath97 destroys the @xmath33 property .",
    "it is not clear if the above example satisfies the @xmath1 condition as defined by sturm @xcite . in sturm s definition",
    "one should be able to find a distribution of geodesics between any two points so that the @xmath0 condition is satisfied along the geodesics given by the distributions .",
    "the key point in the definition is that the distribution is symmetric .",
    "the space @xmath29 we describe here with the maximal diameter @xmath4 is similar to our previous example . as a subset of @xmath69",
    "the space @xmath116 is defined as @xmath117 where @xmath118 \\cup [ 1/4,\\pi/{2}]\\right ) \\times \\{0\\}.\\ ] ] see figure [ fig : example2 ] for an illustration . again",
    "the distance @xmath70 is the @xmath71-distance .",
    "the measure is similar to the measure @xmath76 , but this time the projection of the measure to the interval @xmath119 $ ] is of the form @xmath120 .",
    "again we define the measure in such a way that the density is constant on @xmath121 for all @xmath122 $ ] .",
    "the projected space @xmath123 clearly satisfies @xmath124 .",
    "it is not that surprising that @xmath29 satisfies @xmath3 : the projection deals with the long distances and on the other hand it is already known that sufficiently small balls in @xmath125 with the @xmath71 norm satisfy @xmath126 , see @xcite .",
    "the transition from the one - dimensional part to the two - dimensional part can then be carried out similarly as in the previous example .",
    "nevertheless , let us check that the space @xmath29 really satisfies @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath127 with @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "we again transport linearly in the horizontal direction and so it suffices to check that for all @xmath130 $ ] we can select geodesics @xmath35 from @xmath101 to @xmath131 such that @xmath132.\\ ] ]    we again consider different cases separately depending on the position of @xmath101 and @xmath133 .",
    "first of all , if @xmath134 we can take the measures @xmath135 to be uniformly distributed on the slices @xmath121 .",
    "since the space @xmath123 satisfies @xmath124 , we have the desired inequality in this case .",
    "the second case is when @xmath136 and @xmath137 . in this case",
    "we take the geodesics along which we transport to be such that their images are subsets of sets of the type @xmath138 because inside @xmath139 we are changing the density as if we were transporting in @xmath123 and the density relative to this transport only drops when we leave @xmath139 , again the fact that we have the inequality follows from the observation that the space @xmath123 satisfies @xmath124 .",
    "the final case to check is when @xmath140 . by symmetry",
    "we may assume that @xmath141 .",
    "as in the previous example we define the chosen geodesics from @xmath101 to a point @xmath142 in three subcases .",
    "this time the division to subcases is driven by the fact that the distances from @xmath101 to all the points in @xmath143 are equal , meaning that beyond that distance we can transport along vertically uniformly distributed measures .",
    "let us list the subcases .",
    "first , if @xmath144 , we take the euclidean geodesics . in the subcase @xmath145",
    "we take a geodesic that first goes along the euclidean geodesic that goes via the point @xmath146 from @xmath89 to @xmath147 and then along the euclidean geodesic from @xmath147 to @xmath101 .",
    "the third subcase is when @xmath148 . in this subcase we first transport the mass along the euclidean geodesic to the point @xmath146 ,",
    "then spread the measure uniformly to @xmath149 along euclidean geodesics and finally contract it to @xmath101 along euclidean geodesics .",
    "let us check the density in the different subcases . to deal with the first subcase @xmath144 we observe that @xmath150 for the vertical height @xmath151 of @xmath139 at @xmath152 , where @xmath35 is a geodesic from @xmath101 to @xmath89 . from this ( and the estimates below )",
    "we have that @xmath153 for all @xmath154 $ ] and @xmath155 $ ] and so follows .",
    "( to see the third inequality in define @xmath156 and notice that @xmath157 for all @xmath42 $ ] and @xmath155 $ ] since @xmath158 and @xmath159 for all @xmath42 $ ] and @xmath155 $ ] . )    in the second and third subcases @xmath160 , until we hit @xmath147 we have by the projection as before .",
    "after @xmath147 we have by the estimate for @xmath161 $ ] . when @xmath162 we can estimate the time @xmath163 when we hit @xmath147 by @xmath164 in this case obtaining is easy , since verifying for @xmath165 $ ] and @xmath166 reduces to verifying that @xmath157 for such @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",
    "this follows for example by estimating @xmath169 for @xmath165 $ ] and @xmath166 .",
    "this completes the proof of the @xmath3 condition for our space @xmath170 .",
    "both of our examples above had boundary points in the sense that there are geodesics that can not be infinitely extended as local geodesics .",
    "it is natural to ask if one can modify the examples to have no boundary . by identifying the top and bottom boundaries in the two - dimensional parts of the spaces we should be able to get rid of most of the boundary points .",
    "however , even after the identification the point where the space changes from one - dimensional to two - dimensional will be a boundary point in the above sense .",
    "the nonextendable geodesics are the nonvertical geodesics in the two - dimensional side that are travelling more in the vertical direction than in the horizontal direction .",
    "when they reach the point where the dimension changes they can not be extended to the one - dimensional part so that they are geodesic in a neighbourhood of the point where the dimension changes .",
    "it is also interesting to consider the tangent spaces of the spaces @xmath32 and @xmath29 in the sense of measured gromov - hausdorff limits of blow - ups .",
    "first observation is that the space @xmath32 is the mgh - tangent of @xmath29 at the points @xmath171 and @xmath172 .",
    "this way we could prove the fact that @xmath32 satisfies @xmath1 by proving that any tangent of a @xmath173 space does .    notice that the tangents of @xmath32 at points @xmath174 and @xmath29 at points @xmath175 are all convex subsets of normed spaces . on the other hand we know from @xcite that some subriemannian spaces like the heisenberg group satisfy @xmath0 . with only such nice examples at hand it is natural to ask what are the tangent spaces of @xmath0 spaces ( almost everywhere ) in general ? this is also related to the uniqueness of the tangents , compare to the following result by le donne @xcite .",
