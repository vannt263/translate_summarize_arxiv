    "the behrens - fisher problem is concerned with testing @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the means of two normal populations with possibly different variances @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "an interesting aspect of the problem is that the likelihood equations for the model induced by @xmath5 may have more than one solution .",
    "in fact , with probability one , there will be either one or three solutions with the two cases corresponding to one or two local maxima of the likelihood function . according to simulations of @xcite , three solutions to the likelihood equations occur infrequently if the observations are drawn from a distribution in @xmath5 . in this note",
    "we provide an explanation for this rare occurrence of multiple solutions by proving that under @xmath5 the probability of this event converges to zero when @xmath6 and @xmath7 tend to infinity ( corollary  [ cor : asy ] ) .",
    "this and more general large - sample results about the probability of multiple solutions ( proposition  [ prop : disc - pos - neg ] and theorem  [ thm : critical - smooth ] ) are based on two observations .",
    "first , solving the likelihood equations amounts to solving one cubic polynomial equation .",
    "second , the number of real roots of a cubic can be determined using the cubic discriminant .",
    "the discriminant criterion also allows us to derive a finite - sample bound on the null probability of multiple solutions to the likelihood equations ( proposition  [ prop : t - distribution - bound ] ) .",
    "while arguments can be given for using a likelihood ratio - based test instead of welch s approximate t - test in the behrens - fisher problem @xcite , the latter test is widely used in practice and avoids maximization of the likelihood function under the null hypothesis . in that sense",
    "the practical implications of our study are perhaps not immediate .",
    "however , in more general models involving heteroscedastic structures statistical practice often relies on likelihood ratio tests that do require solving the maximization problem .",
    "our results provide geometric intuition about this problem in the simple univariate behrens - fisher model ( figure  [ fig : curves ] ) , for which it holds , rather reassuringly , that the likelihood function for the null model is asymptotically unimodal if the model is correctly specified",
    ". it would be interesting to obtain generalizations of this fact for other , more complicated models .",
    "we start out by deriving a convenient form of the likelihood equations for the three - parameter model induced by the null hypothesis in the behrens - fisher problem .",
    "let @xmath8 and @xmath9 be two independent normal samples . under the null hypothesis @xmath5 , @xmath1 is equal to @xmath2 and we denote this common mean by @xmath10 .",
    "the log - likelihood function for the null model can be written as @xmath11    -\\frac{m}{2 } \\left [ \\frac{\\hat\\sigma_y^2+(\\bar y-\\mu)^2}{\\sigma_y^2}\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the two sample means , and @xmath14 is the empirical variance for the first sample ; the second empirical variance @xmath15 is defined analogously . if @xmath16 , then both @xmath17 and @xmath15 are positive with probability one .",
    "this sample size condition will be assumed throughout .",
    "the partial derivatives of the log - likelihood function are @xmath18}{2\\sigma_x^4};\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the partial derivative for @xmath4 is analogous . let @xmath19 .",
    "then the likelihood equations obtained by setting the three partial derivatives to zero are equivalent to the polynomial equations @xmath20 here , equivalence means that the two solution sets are almost surely equal . plugging the expressions for @xmath3 and @xmath4 from ( [ eq:2 ] ) and ( [ eq:3 ] ) into ( [ eq:1 ] ) yields the cubic equation @xmath21 with @xmath22 hence , the maximum likelihood estimator @xmath23 can be computed in closed form by solving the univariate cubic equation ( [ eq : cubic ] ) .",
    "we remark that the manipulations leading to the polynomial equations ( [ eq:2 ] ) , ( [ eq:3 ] ) and ( [ eq : cubic ] ) form a trivial case of a computation of a _ lexicographic grbner basis _ @xcite .      a quadratic polynomial @xmath24 in the indeterminate @xmath25 may have no , one , or two ( distinct ) real roots .",
    "which one of the three cases applies is determined by the sign of the discriminant @xmath26 . in the behrens - fisher problem",
    "we are led to the cubic polynomial @xmath27 in ( [ eq : cubic ] ) .",
    "a cubic always has at least one real root , and so we would like to know whether it has one , two , or three real roots .",
    "this can again be decided based on the sign of the _ discriminant _ , which for the cubic takes the form @xmath28 if @xmath29 then @xmath27 has three distinct real roots . if @xmath30 then @xmath27 has a unique real root and two complex ones .",
    "if @xmath31 , then @xmath27 may have one real root of multiplicity three or two distinct real roots of which one has multiplicity two .",
    "these and more general results on discriminants can be found for example in @xcite .",
    "the coefficients @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 of @xmath27 in ( [ eq : cubic ] ) are random variables with a continuous distribution and @xmath35 is a constant .",
    "consequently , @xmath36 is also a continuous random variable such that the event @xmath37 occurs with probability zero . in other words",
    "the behrens - fisher likelihood equations almost surely have one or three real solutions .",
    "the discriminant @xmath36 is a homogeneous polynomial of degree 6 in @xmath38 , @xmath13 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , and depends on @xmath12 and @xmath13 only through their difference .",
    "however , with probability one , the sign of @xmath36 depends only on @xmath41 and the two ratios @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "this follows because @xmath44 with @xmath45 \\\\      & - \\hat\\delta^2      \\bigg[\\hat\\gamma^4(8 + 8r_n - r_n^2)+(8r_n^4 + 8r_n^3-r_n^2 )      -2\\hat\\gamma^2(10r_n+19r_n^2 + 10r_n^3 )      \\bigg]\\\\      & -4(1+r_n)(r_n + \\hat\\gamma^2)^3 .",
    "\\end{split}\\ ] ] while @xmath36 ( and @xmath46 ) remain unchanged if @xmath6 and @xmath7 are replaced by @xmath47 and @xmath48 with @xmath49 , such a change of sample sizes affects the sampling distribution of @xmath36 ( and @xmath46 ) and thus the probability of multiple solutions to the likelihood equations .",
    "we remark that instead of working with @xmath50 one could work with the more symmetric quantities @xmath51 or @xmath52 however , such a substitution would lead to an increased degree in the analog of ( [ eq : d ] ) such that we keep working with @xmath50 in the sequel .    for any given value of @xmath41 , the polynomial @xmath53 in the indeterminates @xmath54 and @xmath50 defines an algebraic curve .",
    "figure [ fig : curves ] shows two examples of these curves over the statistically relevant region with @xmath55 . by symmetry , the curve for @xmath56 has four cusp points at @xmath57 ; the cusps for @xmath58 are at @xmath59 . in general , the four cusps have coordinates @xmath60 the curve has two asymptotes , namely , @xmath61 .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the two respective branches of the curves in figure [ fig : curves ] enclose the region @xmath62 , which contains the ( horizontal ) @xmath54-axis . over this region",
    "the discriminant @xmath36 is negative and the behrens - fisher likelihood equations have a unique real root . clearly , neither the region @xmath62 nor the region @xmath63 need to be convex .",
    "when fixing @xmath54 and increasing @xmath50 then @xmath46 will eventually remain positive because the leading term of @xmath46 , when viewed as a univariate polynomial in @xmath50 , is @xmath64 with @xmath65 .",
    "this means that bimodal likelihood functions arise when the difference between the means @xmath12 and @xmath13 of the two samples is large compared to the empirical variances @xmath17 and @xmath15 .",
    "however , as can be seen in figure [ fig : curves](b ) with @xmath58 , there may exist values of @xmath54 such that the values of @xmath50 corresponding to unimodal likelihood functions do not form an interval .",
    "a finite - sample study of the probability of one versus three solutions to the behrens - fisher likelihood equations seems difficult .",
    "however , under the null hypothesis , we can give a very simple bound .",
    "[ prop : t - distribution - bound ] let the random variable @xmath66 have a t - distribution with @xmath67 degrees of freedom .",
    "let @xmath68 .",
    "if the null hypothesis @xmath5 is true , i.e. , if @xmath69 , then the probability of three distinct real solutions to the behrens - fisher likelihood equations is smaller than @xmath70    three solutions occur if @xmath71 falls in the region @xmath63",
    ". this region is strictly contained in the region of pairs @xmath71 that have @xmath72 with @xmath73 compare figure [ fig : curves ] and ( [ eq : cusp - coordinates ] ) .",
    "hence , @xmath74 is smaller than @xmath75 . under @xmath5 ,",
    "@xmath76 is distributed according to the t - distribution with @xmath67 degrees of freedom . expressing the event @xmath77 in terms of this t - random variable yields the claim .",
    "suppose , for example , that the samples are of equal size with the standard deviation @xmath78 being half the standard deviation @xmath79 , i.e. , @xmath56 and @xmath80 .",
    "then , by proposition [ prop : t - distribution - bound ] , the probability of three distinct real solutions to the behrens - fisher likelihood equations is smaller than 0.023 if @xmath81 , 0.00045 if @xmath82 and 0.00001 if @xmath83 .",
    "hence , despite its crude nature , the bound informs us that the probabilities are small .",
    "monte carlo simulations suggest that the three considered probabilities are in fact a factor 10 or more smaller than the stated bounds .",
    "we begin our study of the large - sample behaviour of the likelihood equations with the case when the discriminant converges almost surely to a non - zero limit .",
    "[ prop : disc - pos - neg ] suppose @xmath84 such that @xmath85 .",

    "2 .   if @xmath91 , then the probability that the behrens - fisher likelihood equations have three distinct real solutions converges to one .",

    "case ( ii ) is analogous .",
    "proposition  [ prop : disc - pos - neg ] does not apply to the situation when @xmath97 is zero .",
    "however , these critical cases can be studied using asymptotics similar to those encountered with likelihood ratio tests .",
    "the resulting asymptotic probabilities will depend on whether or not the point @xmath89 forms a singular point of the curve defined by the vanishing of @xmath97 .",
    "let @xmath98 be a polynomial in the ring of polynomials in the indeterminates @xmath99 and @xmath100 with real coefficients .",
    "let @xmath101 be the algebraic curve @xmath102 .",
    "a point @xmath103 is a singular point if the gradient @xmath104 is zero .",
    "we will show that the critical behaviour of the number of real roots to the behrens - fisher likelihood equations is determined by the local geometry of the curve @xmath105 at the true parameter values @xmath89 .",
    "this geometry is captured in the tangent cone .          1 .",
