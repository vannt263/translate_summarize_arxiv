    "quantum coherence and entanglement are basic properties of quantum systems that play a crucial role in many phenomena , in particular in those related to quantum information and quantum computing @xcite . these properties , however , are usually destroyed by the environment @xcite .",
    "this can happen because of coupling of the quantum systems to infinite reservoirs that generates random fluctuations of the system parameters or direct leakage ( decay ) to the reservoirs .",
    "recent works indicate , however , that under certain conditions the environment may endorse the creation of entanglement between two physical systems , like two spins or two oscillators @xcite . in this paper",
    "we pronounce a positive role of the environment in quantum coherence and entanglement even more .",
    "we demonstrate that it can drive the system to a stable superposition of spatially separated quantum states .",
    "moreover such a superposition can be controlled by varying the system s parameters .",
    "consider for instance a particle in a quantum double - well .",
    "it is well - known that if the particle is prepared in one of the wells it displays rabi oscillations between the wells . the question is what will happen if the wells are coupled not directly but through a reservoir possessing a continuous spectrum , fig .",
    "it is quite natural to expect that instead of rabi oscillations one finds no more than the exponential decay of a particle to the reservoir .",
    "for this reason the dynamics of a quantum system inside _ two _ wells , separated by a reservoir , has not attracted much attention . in the case of identical wells . ]",
    "are the energy levels of the wells and @xmath0 , ( @xmath1 denote the couplings between the level @xmath2 and the level @xmath3 in the reservoir.,width=264 ]    in this paper we demonstrate that , contrary to expectation , the system of quantum wells separated by , and coupled to , a continuum can reveal very peculiar properties .",
    "for instance , one finds localized eigenstates embedded in the continuum .",
    "moreover , in the case of aligned levels , @xmath4 ( fig .  [ fig1 ] ) , the system evolves inexorably to such a state .",
    "this means that at large times there is a finite probability of finding the system in a localized state inside the wells , even though the wells are well separated .",
    "this state is a linear superposition of localized states in different wells .",
    "if @xmath5 , but their difference is smaller than the level width , the system decays to the continuum in the end . during its evolution , however , the system spends time in the superposition state inside the wells and the lifetime of this state can be very long .",
    "the same phenomenon takes place in the many - body case , displaying additional features .",
    "these are the result of particle statistics and of particle interactions . at large times",
    "one can find the many - particle system in linear superpositions of states inside the distant wells , which are entangled .",
    "the most important properties of such systems is that the superposition and entanglement can be controlled by changing the wells parameters , such as the energy levels and their coupling with the reservoir .",
    "this can make these systems very useful for development of new quantum devices and their applications for quantum information and quantum computing .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we investigate one - particle dynamics in two wells separated by a reservoir .",
    "we demonstrate the appearance of stable states localized inside the wells . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] we introduce the optimal basis for the two - well states by a unitary transformation ( resulting in `` dark '' states ) whereby the problem is greatly simplified . in this basis",
    "the mechanism for appearance of isolated , localized states in the continuum can be easily understood .",
    "also the extension to the many - body case is immediate , including in particular the effects of the pauli principle and of particle interaction .",

    "these amplitudes are obtained from the schrdinger equation @xmath18 .",
    "for its solution it is useful to apply the laplace transform , @xmath19 . then the time dependent schrdinger equation becomes the algebraic equation @xmath20 it can be written explicitly as    [ a4 ] @xmath21    the r.h.s . of eqs .",

    "therefore it is even more accessible to experimental realization than the superposition state in distant wells for a symmetric case .",
    "all our findings are based on the exact treatment of the problem without any weak coupling or markovian approximations . the central point in our treatment",
    "is transition to a new basis containing a `` dark '' state . then the entire problem becomes very transparent , so that the main features of the superposition state can be obtained straightforwardly without any detailed calculations .",
    "in fact , the very existence of the bound state imbedded in the continuum is relied upon the availability of such a basis .",
    "this can be establish from general symmetry properties of the hamiltonian .",
    "these are not very restrictive , so that the stable superposition of distant states embedded in the continuum can be found in many different quantum systems .",
    "the optimal basis allows us to treat the many - body case of interacting particles without any essential complications .",
    "then the localized superposition in distant well may include many particle state .",
    "these are usually in an entangled state that can be controlled by varying the wells parameters , as well .",
    "we expect that a peculiar controlled superposition of distant localized states can be realized in various quantum systems , like electrons in separated dots , cold atoms in distant traps and photons is quantum cavities .",
    "we can also anticipate a possible applicability of such systems to quantum computation as a source of many - particle distant entangled state .",
