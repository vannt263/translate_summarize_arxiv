    "transitional protoplanetary disks possess inner cavities nearly devoid of dust ( e.g. , @xcite ) . outside these cavities , in some of the brightest disks ,",
    "radio images reveal that dust is not axisymmetric , but clumps strongly to one side . at dust continuum wavelengths ,",
    "surface brightness contrasts range from values on the order of a few to @xmath030 ( hd 142527 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) to @xmath0130 ( oph irs 48 ; @xcite ; ) .",
    "these contrasts are lower bounds where observations are unresolved .",
    "unlike dust , overdensities in co gas are limited to factors of a few at most .",
    "the lopsided dust concentrations  which may be giving us a first empirical glimpse into the process of planetesimal formation  cry out to be understood .",
    "one proposed mechanism is dust trapping by gas vortices ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the inner rims of transitional disks may be subject to the rossby wave instability which can spawn anticyclonic vortices ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "whether vortices are radially and azimuthally large enough to match the imaging data is debatable .",
    "we submit here a different explanation , one that follows from a simple fact : a lopsided disk moves the barycenter away from the host star .",
    "the gravitational potential therefore includes an `` indirect '' term ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "our paper solves for gas streamlines including the indirect potential , in the limit that gas does not feel its own gravity",
    ". we will discover in this limit that gas occupies a radially wide , horseshoe - shaped annulus that readily concentrates dust grains into patterns similar to those observed .",
    "concentration is by gas drag , not dust self - gravity .",
    "our proposal is that the gas disk exhibits a global `` fast '' mode of azimuthal wavenumber @xmath1 , whose lopsidedness shifts the barycenter off the star .",
    "`` fast '' means that the disk s pattern speed equals its mean keplerian motion , not the apsidal precession frequency that characterizes @xmath1 `` slow '' modes ( cf .",
    "fast modes are more attractive than slow modes for shaping dust grain trajectories and explaining the radio observations , since the non - inertial forces arising from a slow mode s pattern speed are too small to compete with the substantial gas drag forces felt by dust .",
    "we compute gas streamlines ( test particle orbits ) analytically in  2 and numerically in  3 .",
    "how dust concentrates aerodynamically is described in  4",
    ". limitations of our calculations  notably our neglect of gas self - gravity , which prevents us from computing fast modes self - consistently  are discussed in  5 .",
    "[ fig1 ]    we consider analytically the dynamics of a test particle in the gravitational potential of a star with a prescribed motion .",
    "the star has mass @xmath3 and executes a circular orbit of radius @xmath4 with fixed angular frequency @xmath5 about the origin ( star - disk barycenter ) .",
    "this orbit represents the star s `` reflex motion '' in response to the @xmath1 component of the disk s potential .",
    "we work in the frame rotating with the star and centered on the origin ( figure [ fig1 ] ) . in our unit system , the gravitational constant times the stellar mass @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 .",
    "our problem is identical to the standard restricted three - body problem , except that the test particle does not feel the gravity of the secondary ( read : disk ) . because we assume the star s motion arises from the disk potential but neglect the latter when computing the test particle s motion , our calculations are not self - consistent",
    "; we proceed anyway in the hope that some of the grosser , qualitative features of our model will survive a more careful study .    in cartesian",
    "coordinates , the test particle obeys @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the celestial mechanician s centrifugal potential plus the potential of the star ( offset from the origin by @xmath4 on the negative @xmath11-axis ) : @xmath12 equilibrium points , where gravity and centrifugal forces balance , lie along the @xmath11-axis . setting @xmath13 in equations ( [ eqn_motion_x ] ) and ( [ eqn_motion_y ] )",
    ", we find @xmath14 to order @xmath4 , the two equilibrium points are located at @xmath15    assuming that small displacements about these equilibria evolve with time @xmath16 according to @xmath17 , we linearize and combine equations ( [ eqn_motion_x ] ) and ( [ eqn_motion_y ] ) to arrive at the relation for the eigenfrequency @xmath18 : @xmath19\\lambda^2 \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\left [ 1 + \\frac{1-\\mu}{(x_{\\rm eq } + \\mu)^3 } -2 \\frac{(1-\\mu)^2}{(x_{\\rm eq } + \\mu)^6 } \\right ] = 0 \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the equilibrium point at @xmath20 is unstable ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "by contrast , the equilibrium point at @xmath22 is stable for @xmath23 and is characterized by two frequencies of oscillation : one nearly equal to the mean motion @xmath5 ( and representing the usual epicyclic motion of an eccentric orbit ) , and another @xmath24 with @xmath25 in equation ( [ u_approx ] ) , we have expanded @xmath10 in small radial ( but not small azimuthal ) displacements @xmath26 about the stable point",
    ". we insert ( [ u_approx ] ) into ( [ eqn_motion_r ] ) and ( [ eqn_motion_th ] ) , keeping only leading - order terms and taking @xmath27 to filter out fast epicycles ; then @xmath28 multiplying ( [ eqn_motion_th_approx ] ) by @xmath29 , integrating over time , and substituting ( [ eqn_motion_r_approx ] ) , we obtain the following `` shape function '' : @xmath30 \\,.\\ ] ] here @xmath31 is a constant of integration that takes values between 0 ( zero amplitude libration at @xmath32 ) and 1 ( maximal libration ) .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] samples several @xmath31-values ; evidently the shape function ( [ b_eqn ] ) traces horseshoe - shaped trajectories enclosing the stable point .",
    "the horseshoes are radially widest at @xmath32 : @xmath33 this width can be a large fraction of the radius ; e.g. , for @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( characteristic of a disk whose mass is @xmath0@xmath36 ) , the full width is @xmath37 .",
    "although the libration trajectories are shaped like horseshoes , the square - root scalings in ( [ slow ] ) and ( [ disk_width_scale ] ) for the libration frequency and width characterize tadpoles in the standard three - body problem .",
    "this kinship between our horseshoe orbits and conventional tadpoles is expected . in both types of motion ,",
    "the turning points ( located farthest from the positive @xmath11-axis ) are effected by the offset host star which exerts torques on the test particle that deflect it back toward the @xmath11-axis .",
    "we construct a model gas disk based on ideas developed by @xcite and applied in many galactic contexts ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "gas is assumed to occupy closed , non - intersecting test particle orbits . crossing",
    "orbits are forbidden because they lead to shocks and energy dissipation .",
    "gas streamlines approximate test particle orbits insofar as gas sound speeds are smaller than orbital velocities and gas self - gravity is negligible .    working in the rotating frame of  2 , we set @xmath35 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 , where @xmath40 au is the disk s characteristic radius",
    ". the star is positioned at @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "starting on the @xmath11-axis , we launch a test particle with an initial velocity @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) and integrate its trajectory until it re - crosses the @xmath11-axis .",
    "the final position and velocity are required to match initial values to within 1 part in @xmath45 ; the initial @xmath46 is varied until these conditions are met .",
    "the integrations    [ fig2 ]    are performed using python s explicit runge - kutta integrator of order 8(5,3 ) ( ` dop853 ` ) with an accuracy setting of @xmath47 .",
    "a total of 22 initial @xmath11-positions , distributed between the stable point at @xmath48 au and @xmath49 au are selected for the construction of 22 orbits / streamlines ; see figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "their shapes match well the horseshoe orbits found analytically in  2 .",
    "in particular , we confirm that equations ( [ slow ] ) and ( [ disk_width_scale ] ) for the libration frequency and radial width are obeyed .",
    "each streamline is defined by @xmath50 points marking the test particle s position recorded at equal intervals of time . to compute the gas surface density ,",
    "we assign each streamline a mass @xmath51 $ ] , where @xmath11 identifies the streamline s starting position ; we assign more mass to inner horseshoes than outer ones .",
    "lines are drawn between adjacent points on neighboring streamlines so that the entire space is tiled by quadrilaterals ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "each quadrilateral of area @xmath52 is assigned a surface density @xmath53 , where @xmath54 streamline mass / @xmath55 .    for the most part this procedure yields surface densities that vary smoothly from quadrilateral to quadrilateral .",
    "however , we find a few spikes in density near the disk s edges ( outermost horseshoes )",
    ". these are numerical artifacts that arise from our particular choice of streamlines .",
    "because our gravitational potential is only weakly non - axisymmetric , it admits a large variety of orbits that satisfy our tolerance criteria for being closed and non - intersecting .",
    "our selection of streamlines is thus not unique .",
    "we chose streamlines that seemed to minimize the high density spikes , but were not able to eliminate them .",
    "fortunately the afflicted regions , which are restricted to disk edges , are tiny and easily masked out .",
    "we smooth @xmath56 by first applying the python function ` scipy.ndimage.interpolation.map_coordinates ` which sub - samples to a finer non - regular @xmath57-@xmath58 grid using a local order-1 spline .",
    "we then establish @xmath56 on a regular @xmath57-@xmath58 grid with ` scipy.interpolate.griddata ` which uses a local linear interpolation .",
    "the final step is to normalize the disk mass so that the barycenter remains at the origin .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows our final gas disk , of mass @xmath59 .    to 0th order ,",
    "the gas velocities are the ( interpolated ) velocities of the test particles used to construct the original 22 streamlines .",
    "we add a 1st order correction to account for gas pressure gradients . with a fractional error of @xmath60 ,",
    "pressure forces are balanced by coriolis forces ( the flow is geostrophic ) ; the velocity corrections read @xmath61 and are evaluated by applying python s ` gradient ` function to @xmath56 .",
    "minor numerical artifacts in the 1st order velocities at disk edges are smoothed using a combination of median and gaussian filters .",
    "the sound speed @xmath62 is fixed at 0.37 km / s , appropriate for gas at 40 k.    [ fig3 ]",
    "we now add dust particles to our gas disk .",
    "a dust particle behaves like a test particle except that it also feels a gas drag acceleration @xmath63 which damps dust - gas relative velocities over an aerodynamic stopping time @xmath64 .",
    "the stopping time scales inversely as the volumetric gas density @xmath65 , which we compute from @xmath56 by assuming the disk has a constant vertical thickness @xmath66 .",
    "our convention is to assign every particle a stokes parameter @xmath67 evaluated at the position of peak @xmath65 ( i.e. , at the stable point @xmath68 , @xmath69 ) ; the stopping time at any other location then scales inversely as the local @xmath65 ( which deviates from the peak value by at most a factor of @xmath03 ) .",
    "a total of 2100 dust particles are laid down with an initial surface density matching that of the gas disk and with initial velocities equal to the 0th order gas velocities .",
    "dust trajectories are computed using the same runge - kutta integrator as was used to obtain the gas streamlines .",
    "gas densities and velocities are computed by local linear interpolation .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the evolution of dust surface density for @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 ( equivalent to grain sizes of @xmath0 1 mm , 1 cm , and 10 cm for an assumed bulk density of 1 g/@xmath73 ) . because gas feels pressure forces while dust does not , dust and gas velocities generally differ .",
    "dust particles feel tailwinds / headwinds that drag them toward gas pressure maxima ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for our disk ,",
    "the global pressure maximum is located at the stable point , and indeed particles with @xmath70 and @xmath71 collect there .",
    "we estimate the concentration time as follows . in a gas disk with a radial pressure gradient",
    ", the radial speed of a particle is @xmath74 valid for any @xmath75 ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for our problem ,",
    "@xmath76 for streamlines to the left / right of the stable point ( see figure [ fig3 ] ) ; we have here used the fact that our disk has a characteristic radial width @xmath77 ( equation [ disk_width_scale ] ) .",
    "thus particles interior / exterior to the stable point drift radially outward / inward , traversing a series of ever - smaller horseshoes . the timescale to cross the radial width of the disk and collect onto the stable point is then @xmath78 which predicts that @xmath79 particles accumulate fastest .",
    "our numerical experiments confirm this expectation and also verify the asymptotic scalings ( @xmath80 for @xmath81 and @xmath82 for @xmath83 ; see figure [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "[ fig4 ]    surprisingly , not all particles concentrate at the global pressure maximum located on the @xmath11-axis ( the gas disk symmetry axis )",
    ". figures [ fig3 ] and [ fig5 ] reveal that marginally aerodynamically coupled particles collect along an arc that extends off the @xmath11-axis in the direction of orbital motion .",
    "starting from the @xmath11-axis at @xmath84 , the position angles of final accumulation points advance with increasing @xmath75 to a maximum of @xmath045@xmath2 at @xmath85 ; further increasing @xmath75 causes the position angles to slide back down , returning to zero at @xmath86 .",
    "the bottom right panel of figure [ fig3 ] illustrates that , as long as the drag force is neither too strong nor too weak , a three - way force balance between the offset stellar gravity , the centrifugal force , and drag is possible , but only in one quadrant of the rotating frame .",
    "particle size segregation off - axis offers an observational test of our model : the locations of peak intensity in dust emission maps may vary systematically with wavelength , to the extent that different observing wavelengths select for different size particles .",
    "a lopsided disk displaces its host star from the system barycenter . in the resultant `` offset '' stellar potential ( one that has an indirect term )",
    ", we have calculated that gas streamlines take the form of horseshoes .",
    "our calculations are not self - consistent because on the one hand we have invoked the gas disk s mass to move the star , but on the other we have neglected the disk s gravity when computing gas streamlines .",
    "our neglect of gas self - gravity is a severe approximation : the disk s gravity is as strong as the indirect forcing , since both scale as @xmath4 . indeed , when we re - calculate _ a posteriori _ the potential @xmath10 including the gas disk s contribution , we find that @xmath10 s topology changes qualitatively .",
    "in particular , what was a global extremum at @xmath87 becomes a saddle point .",
    "thus the mode we have constructed in this paper is not an equilibrium fast mode .",
    "still , we might not be too far off the mark ; reducing the disk mass by a factor of @xmath02 ( while keeping the stellar offset @xmath4 fixed ) restores the original topology at @xmath88 .",
    "we are also encouraged by stellar dynamics calculations performed by @xcite , who found that their  rotating lopsided mode \" ( i.e. , a fast @xmath1 mode ) supports  banana \" ( i.e. , horseshoe - shaped ) orbits ; see their figure 14 .",
    "future work should incorporate disk self - gravity , not only to construct self - consistent fast modes , but also to search for instabilities that can create lopsided mass distributions .",
    "one step toward more realistic gas equilibria is to replace our test - particle calculation with a hydrodynamical one that accounts for gas pressure . in this regard",
    ", we experimented with a 2d inviscid hydro - simulation using the ` pluto ` code @xcite , evolving an initially circular and uniform gas ring in an offset stellar potential ( see caption to figure [ fig2]b for technical details ) .",
    "a few numerical difficulties complicated this first - cut experiment .",
    "the system did not settle into steady state ; gas leaked outward and was lost off the grid ; and our boundary conditions , chosen mainly for convenience , affected the propagation of spiral density waves . nevertheless , @xmath02080 orbits into our hydro - simulation , we observed the gas disk conforming to the same horseshoe shapes obtained with our test - particle method  compare figures [ fig2]a and [ fig2]b  and found consistent results for dust concentration .",
    "the qualitative agreement between our test - particle calculation and our hydro - simulation helps to validate the former , and motivates us to improve upon the latter by including gas self - gravity , viscosity , turbulence , and dust feedback .",
    "fast modes promise to better reproduce observed dust distributions with large azimuthal and radial extents ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) . in our demonstration model , particles with sizes of 0.11 mm have concentration times on the order of the disk age or longer , and should thus occupy horseshoe - shaped regions like those shown in the top right panel of figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "in addition , larger particles , having stokes parameters @xmath8910 ( particle sizes of 1100 cm ) , naturally spread themselves in azimuth by @xmath045@xmath2 .",
    "gas turbulence can also diffuse dust particles , keeping them on large horseshoe orbits .",
    "the pclet number is the ratio of timescales for turbulent diffusion and concentration : @xmath90 here @xmath91 is the dust particle diffusivity ( equation 5 of @xcite ) , @xmath92 is the gas diffusivity , and @xmath93 is the shakura - sunyaev turbulence parameter .",
    "small @xmath94  i.e. , more spatially extended dust  obtains for @xmath95 ( mm - sized or smaller particles ) and @xmath96 .",
    "our proposed lopsided gas mode is gravitational and global ; hence its radial width is not limited by the pressure scale height @xmath97 .",
    "this limitation afflicts vortices , since the keplerian shear across a vortex must remain subsonic ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) . @xcite",
    "acknowledge this difficulty in the last paragraph of their section 6.5 , noting that the radial half - width of the dust trap in oph irs 48 is 17 au @xmath98 whereas their vortex theory ( see their equation 68 ) predicts a maximum half - width of @xmath0@xmath99 .",
    "our horseshoe - shaped orbits are not constrained by @xmath97 and may thus better reproduce the azimuthally and radially wide horseshoe - shaped emission seen in transitional disks like hd 142527 @xcite . because the gas mode is global ,",
    "we speculate that it may be more resistant to the destructive effects of dust back - reaction than are vortices .",
    "disk gravity underlies our mode but may undercut vortices ; @xcite found that self - gravity shrinks vortices and frustrates their merging .",
    "we have not identified the origin of the fast mode .",
    "it may be that , like the vortices of @xcite , a planet is responsible .",
    "a passing star might also pull the disk to one side of the star and excite a long - lived fast mode ( see @xcite who use a passing star to excite slow modes ) .",
    "but for economy of hypothesis , one can do no better than look to the self - gravitational field of the gas disk itself @xcite .",
