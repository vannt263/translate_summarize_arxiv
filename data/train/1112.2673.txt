    "over the last decade and a half there has been a dramatic increase in data available for studying long duration gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) . besides the gamma rays , afterglows in the x - ray , optical and radio are seen , and host galaxies have been identified . in a handful of cases `` supernova bumps '' are seen in the optical afterglows , e.g. grb 980326 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , spectra for type ic supernova have been identified in a few cases @xcite .",
    "these developments have lead to the theoretical conjecture that all long duration gamma ray bursts are the result of the collapse of a massive star ; for a review see @xcite .",
    "the temporal evolution of light curve spectra of traditional core collapse supernovae are driven by the decay of nickel-56 to cobalt-56 and the subsequent decay of cobalt-56 to iron-56 .",
    "the half lives for these decays are approximately six days and seventy - seven days respectively .",
    "after these nuclei beta decay , their daughter nuclei emit gamma rays which then thermalize in the ejecta .",
    "the energy from these decays is thus re - emitted in the optical and observed as the supernova light curve .",
    "thus the intensity of a supernova bump should be directly influenced by the amount of @xmath4ni produced in the object . on the order of tenths of solar masses of nickel",
    "are needed .",
    "for example , it has been estimated that around @xmath5 of @xmath4ni is necessary to explain sn2003dh which accompanied grb030329 @xcite .    the commonly discussed model for the type of supernova that produces a grb is the collapsar model @xcite .",
    "in this case the star has too much rotation to produce a standard core collapse supernova .",
    "a hot @xmath6 mev disk surrounding a black hole is produced at the center .",
    "nickel-56 can be produced in two different ways .",
    "it can be produced in explosive burning , when a shock wave propagates out through the star and pre - existing nuclei are then burned to @xmath4ni @xcite .",
    "this is the same mechanism as in traditional core collapse supernovae , but the elemental yields are different since the explosion energy is larger .",
    "however , nickel-56 can also be produced in a disk wind .",
    "this is a primary process where free neutrons and protons are ejected from the disk and combine to form nuclei @xcite .",
    "any assessment of @xmath4ni production in grbs must consider both mechanisms .",
    "the latter mechanism is more difficult to model , since it requires a careful accounting of the neutrinos in the disk . in this paper",
    "we extend the preliminary studies of @xcite , and examine the production of nickel-56 from the outflow from a variety of disks .",
    "we discuss not only the importance of the electron fraction in determining the abundance yields , but also the role of entropy and outflow timescale .",
    "recent studies , e.g. @xcite and references therein , have used estimates of ejected @xmath4ni mass to constrain the grb central engine .",
    "this study provides a reference for anyone considering nickel-56 production in models of long duration gamma - ray bursts .",
    "in order to study the nucleosynthesis in the hot outflows from grb accretion disks , we first need to determine the composition of and the neutrino fluxes emitted from the accretion disk itself .",
    "we therefore begin with existing hydrodynamical black hole accretion disk ( ad - bh ) models with parameters appropriate for long - duration grbs . for this study",
    "we have chosen the one - dimensional , steady - state ad - bh models of @xcite ( cb ) .",
    "the cb models are fully relativistic and incorporate important microphysics effects , such as neutrino trapping and an evolving neutron - to - proton ratio , neglected in other relativistic disk calculations . here",
    "we investigate a range of steady - state disk models with mass accretion rates @xmath7 , where @xmath8 @xmath9 .",
    "we calculate the initial nuclear composition of each disk as described in @xcite .",
    "we find the disk compositions we calculate as a post - processing step match well with the disk compositions reported in @xcite , which are calculated along with the disk hydrodynamics . in the inner regions of all of the disks",
    ", nuclei are dissociated into their constituent nucleons , and the ratio of neutrons to protons is subsequently set by the weak interactions @xmath10 we describe the composition of the disks by the electron fraction @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the number densities of neutrons and protons , respectively . for disks with the lowest accretion rates of those considered here ,",
    "weak reaction rates are slow even in the inner regions of the disks . in these cases",
    "the disk composition remains roughly balanced between neutrons and protons and @xmath11 remains close to 0.5 . for disks with higher accretion rates , conditions in the inner region of the disks are hotter and denser , and weak reactions are correspondingly faster . for disks with @xmath15 ,",
    "electron capture on protons , the forward reaction of eqn .",
    "1 , predominates , and the inner regions of the disks become quite neutron rich . fig .",
    "[ fig : diskye ] shows the electron fractions in the disk for two radial distances , @xmath16 km and 100 km , from the black hole for the disk models used in this work .",
    "a full discussion of the disk compositions of ad - bh can be found in , for example , @xcite .",
    "these disk electron fractions provide the starting points for the calculations of the nucleosynthesis from the disks .    while calculating the composition of the disks , we additionally calculate the neutrino fluxes from the disk as in @xcite .",
    "most of the ad - bhs considered in this work are optically thin to neutrinos and the emitted fluxes are primarily due to electron and positron captures in the disk .",
    "since the rate of electron captures in the disks far exceeds the rate of positron captures for all disks with @xmath17 , the electron neutrino flux emitted from the disk is significantly higher than the electron antineutrino flux .",
    "this has important consequences for the nucleosynthesis in the outflow .",
    "we follow the outflowing material as described in @xcite .",
    "we take the outflow to be adiabatic and the velocity @xmath18 of the outflowing material as a function of radial distance from the black hole @xmath19 to be @xmath20 , with @xmath21 km / s , @xmath22 is the starting disk position , and @xmath23 controls the rate of the acceleration of the material .",
    "we investigate a range of @xmath23 , @xmath24 , where smaller @xmath23 corresponds to more rapid initial acceleration , and two disk starting positions , @xmath16 km and 100 km .",
    "we connect the evolution of the density to our velocity prescription by setting the mass loss rate @xmath25 of the outflow to be constant , first in cylindrical symmetry as the material lifts off vertically from the disk , and then in spherical symmetry as the material expands radially away at later times .",
    "we take the initial composition of the material to be that of the disk at the starting radius @xmath22 .",
    "we then follow the nuclear recombination using a full nuclear network code as described in @xcite .",
    "a schematic of the outflow is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : traj ] .",
    "while the entropy of the disk is quite low , several potential heating processes can increase the entropy of the material as it lifts off the disk . to make some estimate of what range in entropies",
    "is realistic for the wind , we consider the rate of change of entropy due to just one potential heating source",
    " neutrino captures in the outflow .",
    "we start with the approximate expressions for the neutrino heating and cooling rates from @xcite and calculate the change in entropy per baryon from energy conservation , recast for a neutrino - driven wind in eqn ( 26 ) of @xcite as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the entropy per baryon , @xmath28 is the mass of a nucleon , @xmath29 is the temperature , and @xmath30 is the specific net heating rate due to neutrino and antineutrino interactions . when we apply this expression to our outflow velocity and density profiles as described above , we find , for example , for an @xmath31 disk , the change in entropy per baryon in the outflow due to neutrino interactions ranges from @xmath32 , while for a @xmath33 disk , the range is @xmath34 .",
    "we note that these estimates represent a lower limit , as additional processes ( e.g. , magnetic heating ) are expected to play an important role .",
    "we therefore investigate outflow entropies up to somewhat larger values , @xmath35 .",
    "the element synthesis leading to the production of @xmath4ni for a sample ad - bh outflow trajectory is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : nuc ] , which shows the evolution of the mass fractions of neutrons , protons , alpha particles , and @xmath4ni as a function of decreasing temperature @xmath36 , where @xmath37 k and @xmath29 is the temperature in the outflow in kelvins . in this example",
    ", the material is ejected from an ad - bh with @xmath38 at a starting radius of @xmath39 km ; the initial composition is therefore quite neutron rich . as the material lifts off the disk , it transitions from the dense , low entropy , electron - degenerate disk conditions to the higher entropy",
    "( @xmath40 in this example ) , hotter , accelerated outflow conditions .",
    "the higher entropy favors a balance of electrons and positrons such that positron capture , the forward reaction of eqn .",
    "2 , can compete with electron capture , and the electron fraction quickly rises . as the material moves away from the disk , it cools and expands , and weak reaction rates slow .",
    "even so , the electron fraction continues to evolve as the positron capture rate , and eventually the electron neutrino capture ( the reverse reaction of eqn .",
    "1 ) rate , are slightly faster than the electron capture rate .",
    "the positron capture rate exceeds the electron capture rate because of the neutron - proton mass difference , and eventually the electron neutrino capture rate exceeds both the electron and positron capture rates as the latter drop much more rapidly ( @xmath41 ) above the disk .",
    "therefore the material gradually becomes proton - rich prior to nuclear reassembly , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : nuc ] for @xmath42 .",
    "this portion of the outflow trajectory , where the material is composed of free nucleons and their ratio is adjusted by weak interactions , is labeled ( a ) in figs .",
    "[ fig : traj ] and [ fig : nuc ] .    in the first stage of nuclear reassembly , labeled ( b ) in figs .",
    "[ fig : traj ] and [ fig : nuc ] , protons and neutrons combine into alpha particles ( @xmath43he nuclei ) .",
    "conversion into alphas is most efficient at @xmath44 , where equal numbers of protons and neutrons are present . in this example , the material is slightly proton - rich , so all of the neutrons and a matching number of protons combine into alphas , and a small fraction of excess protons are left over . in the second stage of nuclear reassembly , labeled ( c ) in figs .",
    "[ fig : traj ] and [ fig : nuc ] , alpha particles combine via the triple alpha process to produce @xmath45c , and a series of alpha captures on carbon culminate in the production of @xmath4ni .",
    "the triple - alpha process and the subsequent alpha captures are highly temperature - dependent , and so the efficiency of the conversion of alphas to @xmath4ni depends strongly on the evolution of the thermodynamic conditions in the outflow .",
    "if the outflow is coasting at this point such that the temperature drops slowly , most of the alphas will convert to nickel ; in the example considered here , however , this is nt quite the case , and a bit more than one half of the alphas end up in @xmath4ni .    the production of @xmath4ni can therefore depend on a number of parameters : the mass accretion rate of the ad - bh , the point in the ad - bh at which the outflow originates , the entropy per baryon and the acceleration of the outflow , and the neutrino interactions in the outflow . the influence of each of these parameters in turn is described in sections [ entrop]-[diskr ] below .",
    "the production of nickel depends sensitively on the entropy per baryon in the outflowing material .",
    "[ fig : ni ] shows the final mass fraction of @xmath4ni in the disk outflow as a function of the mass accretion rate @xmath46 of the ad - bh and the entropy @xmath47 in the outflow , for a sample set of trajectories with starting disk position @xmath39 km and wind parameter @xmath48 .",
    "we see vigorous production of @xmath4ni over the majority of the parameter space .",
    "interestingly , for @xmath49 , the production of nickel does not appear to depend strongly on the accretion rate of the ad - bh and is instead a much stronger function of the entropy per baryon in the outflow .",
    "first we consider the nickel production in outflows from the ad - bhs with @xmath49 . in the outflow trajectories with @xmath50 ,",
    "the entropy is not much higher than in the disk itself and so the material retains some of the neutron richness of the disk . in these cases ,",
    "the neutron excess remaining after alpha - particle assembly leads to neutron captures on the alpha - capture chain nuclei , and heavier isotopes of nickel predominate .",
    "outflow trajectories with @xmath51 are sufficiently high in entropy such that the neutron richness of the disk is erased by positron capture in the outflow .",
    "the most efficient production of @xmath4ni occurs just at this transition between neutron - rich and proton - rich , where @xmath44 ; for the trajectories considered in fig .",
    "[ fig : ni ] this occurs when @xmath52 . at even higher entropies , the assembly into alphas",
    "is shifted to later times , and the weak reactions on free nucleons have more time to drive the material proton rich .",
    "therefore as we consider outflow trajectories with various entropies , we find the higher entropy cases produce higher @xmath11 and thus less efficient production of @xmath4ni .",
    "the outflows from ad - bhs with @xmath53 differ slightly from the above picture .",
    "disks with lower mass accretion rates have lower central disk temperatures and densities .",
    "the most important effect of this for disks with @xmath54 is that the outflows have lower starting temperatures and densities .",
    "this means the weak rates are not necessarily fast enough for the electron fraction to reequilibrate in the outflow prior to nuclear reassembly , and so the neutron richness of the disk is retained to higher entropies . for the lowest mass accretion rate disks considered in this work , @xmath55 , the central disk temperatures and densities are sufficiently low that the composition of the disk remains fairly balanced between neutrons and protons , as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : diskye ] .",
    "the outflows from these disks therefore have electron fractions close to a half  and correspondingly strong @xmath4ni production  at lower entropies .",
    "while the entropy per baryon in the outflow plays a central role in setting the electron fraction , another important ingredient is the time available for each stage of the nucleosynthesis . in our outflow parameterization",
    "this is set by the wind parameter @xmath23 , which determines the initial acceleration of the outflow material .",
    "[ fig : beta ] , similarly to fig .",
    "[ fig : ni ] , shows the final mass fraction of nickel in the outflowing material as a function of the mass accretion rate @xmath46 of the ad - bh and the entropy @xmath47 in the outflow , for a sample set of trajectories with starting disk position @xmath39 km and wind parameters @xmath56 , 1.4 , 2.0 , and 2.6 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : beta ] , increases in @xmath23 decrease the overall efficiency of @xmath4ni production and , for high values of @xmath23 , shift the entropy per baryon @xmath47 of the most efficient production .    in order to understand the decrease in efficiency with increasing @xmath23 ,",
    "consider that the most robust @xmath4ni production occurs when the outflow conditions evolve ( 1 ) sufficiently rapidly at early times to prevent the material from becoming too proton - rich and ( 2 ) sufficiently slowly at late times to facilitate the complete conversion of alphas to @xmath4ni .",
    "small values of @xmath23 correspond to rapid initial acceleration where the material quickly attains coasting speed , while outflows with large values of @xmath23 accelerate slowly at first and evolve more rapidly at later times .",
    "this effect is illustrated in table 1 , which shows the average values of the outflow velocity @xmath57 divided by the radial distance of the material @xmath19 for two key points in the evolution of the outflow  at early times when the electron fraction is set by weak interactions and late times during nuclear reassembly .",
    "the value of @xmath58 serves as an indicator of how rapidly conditions evolve during these key periods ; robust @xmath4ni production therefore requires large values of @xmath58 at early times and small values at late times . as table 1 shows , these conditions are satisified in trajectories with the smallest values of @xmath23 .",
    "trajectories with larger @xmath23 evolve too rapidly at late times to efficiently synthesize nickel , and , as shown in the table , most of the material is left as alpha particles .    for very high @xmath23 , @xmath59 , the most efficient @xmath4ni production shifts to lower entropies .",
    "this effect is due to the influence of neutrino interactions in the outflow .",
    "as shown in table 1 , the evolution of the outflow for high @xmath23 is slow at early times , when the material is close to the disk .",
    "the high @xmath23 trajectories , therefore , receive the highest neutrino fluence .",
    "since the electron neutrino flux from the disk is significantly higher than the electron antineutrino flux , the net influence of the neutrinos is to drive the material proton rich via the reverse reaction in eqn .",
    "the low entropy trajectories that , in the absence of the neutrino interactions , would be neutron rich become proton rich and can therefore effectively produce @xmath4ni , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : nu ] .      while the outflow nucleosynthesis is primarily dependent on the outflow conditions as described above , the initial conditions  the local disk conditions at the point of origin of the outflow  also have some bearing on the final nickel production .",
    "[ fig : r0 ] , similarly to fig .",
    "[ fig : ni ] , shows the mass fraction of nickel in the outflowing material as a function of the mass accretion rate @xmath46 of the ad - bh and the entropy @xmath47 in the outflow , for a sample set of trajectories with @xmath60 and two starting disk positions , @xmath16 km and 100 km .",
    "nickel production is similar in both cases , though trajectories originating from the inner disk region are somewhat less efficient .",
    "this is due to two separate effects  the influence of neutrino interactions and the starting temperature of the material . in the disk itself",
    ", the temperatures and densities increase with decreasing radius , and correspondingly the rates of weak reactions , and therefore the emission of neutrinos , also increase .",
    "thus the material outflowing from smaller radii will have higher initial temperatures and densities than outflows from larger disk radii , and the neutrino flux the material is exposed to in the outflow will be higher .",
    "the latter effect tends to increase the electron fraction of the material ; for trajectories that are already proton rich this decreases the efficiency of alpha particle formation .",
    "the former effect ",
    "the larger of the two  postpones alpha particle reassembly to later times and farther distances in the outflow .",
    "as shown in table 1 , the velocity divided by radial distance @xmath58 is faster during the epoch of alpha particle reassembly for smaller starting radii , resulting in less efficient nickel production .",
    "while in this work our focus is on the production of nickel-56 , we note that other interesting nuclear species may also be synthesized in the outflow . trajectories with strong nickel-56 production can make a number of intermediate mass nuclei that are underproduced in galactic chemical evolution studies , such as @xmath61sc , @xmath62ti , and @xmath63zn @xcite .",
    "low entropy ( @xmath50 ) trajectories from disks with @xmath64 are moderately neutron rich ; these outflows produce heavier nickel isotopes and @xmath65 nuclei , and can potentially make some light @xmath19-process nuclei .",
    "high entropy ( @xmath66 ) trajectories with slow initial acceleration can make some interesting light @xmath14-process nuclei such as @xmath67se , @xmath68kr , @xmath69sr , and @xmath70mo .",
    "an example of the latter two types of nucleosynthesis is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mo92 ] , which compares the final mass fraction of the light @xmath14-nucleus @xmath70mo produced in the outflow to its solar mass fraction .",
    "the origin of this nucleus has long been a mystery , though studies of the newly - discovered @xmath71 process @xcite suggest early supernova neutrino - driven winds to be a strong candidate site for its production .",
    "here we examine its production in the context of our grb outflow models .    in the case of the moderately accelerating outflow , @xmath60 ,",
    "we see strong @xmath70mo production for low entropies , where the material is moderately neutron - rich .",
    "however , here the synthesis of @xmath70mo is accompanied by excessive overproduction of some @xmath65 closed shell nuclei such as @xmath72sr , @xmath73y , and @xmath74zr .",
    "the overproduction of @xmath65 nuclei is so large ( greater than a factor of @xmath75 over solar in some cases ) for these trajectories that if one knew precisely the amount of disk outflow and the rate at which accretion disks are formed , one could in principle constrain the disk wind conditions from this information .",
    "alternately , we see that for the case of the outflows with slow initial acceleration , @xmath76 , the greatest @xmath70mo production occurs at high entropies , from disks with the most vigorous neutrino emission .",
    "these trajectories have electron fractions greater than 0.6 and experience the highest neutrino fluence , both requirements for a successful @xmath71 process .",
    "the production of @xmath70mo and other light @xmath14 nuclei via a @xmath71 process in grb disk outflows has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "finally , for comparison we consider an alternate , spherical outflow model in which the evolution of the electron fraction is tied more closely to the hydrodynamics .",
    "we construct the model by first constraining the outflow to follow radial streamlines with zero vorticity .",
    "this , along with the steady flow approximation , implies the bernoulli function is constant along the streamline that defines the outflow trajectory . in its simplest form ,",
    "the bernoulli function is @xmath77 where @xmath18 is the velocity , @xmath78 is the specific enthalpy , and @xmath79 is the gravitational potential due to the black hole , @xmath80 .",
    "we write the specific enthalpy as @xmath81,\\ ] ] where @xmath82 is the baryon number density , and @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the number density and chemical potential , respectively , of species @xmath85 , where the sum over species includes electrons , positrons , neutrons , protons , alpha particles , and an average heavy nucleus .",
    "we solve for the outflow hydrodynamics by further assuming adiabatic flow and a constant mass outflow rate , @xmath86 .",
    "we evolve the composition of the outflowing material as described in sec .",
    "the spherical outflow model differs from the parameterized wind primarily in the shape of the outflow trajectory  which is purely radial with no initial vertical piece  and the significantly slower acceleration of the outflowing material .",
    "both of these effects impact the extent to which neutrino interactions influence the resulting nucleosynthesis , though in opposite directions .",
    "a purely radial trajectory moves material away from the central disk region , which is the source of the hottest neutrinos , more directly than initially - vertical flow .",
    "however , this effect is dwarfed here by the effect of the dramatically larger neutrino fluence that arises due to the slower acceleration .",
    "the initial flow is so much slower that the electron fraction re - equilibrates in the outflow in every case , to values above 0.5 . for the low mass accretion rate disks , this results in vigorous @xmath4ni production , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spherical ] .",
    "however , in higher accretion rate disks that have non - negligible antineutrino emission , the production of nickel shifts to heavier isotopes .",
    "this is due to a mini-@xmath71-like process , whereby antineutrino interactions on the free protons remaining after the onset of heavy element formation create neutrons that are quickly captured by nuclei , primarily the dominant @xmath4ni .",
    "the result is a shift from @xmath4ni to @xmath87ni and finally to @xmath88ni with increasing disk @xmath46 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spherical ] , compared to the almost constant production of @xmath4ni that results when neutrino interactions are neglected .",
    "nickel production in the outflows from black hole accretion disks may be an important component of the total grb nickel-56 production .",
    "we have outlined the ways in which @xmath4ni can be formed by black hole accretion disks under a variety of conditions , taking careful account of the neutrino interactions .",
    "we find that entropy is a strong diagnostic across a broad range of accretion disk models .",
    "nickel production appears to be optimal for only modest increases in entropy over the in - disk values ; for the disks studied here with @xmath64 , this can be accounted for via neutrino heating alone .",
    "we note that nickel can also be produced via thermonuclear burning from a shock that goes through a star , if the disk is associated with a hypernova explosion .",
    "however , in models without this additional production mechanism , one could constrain the required conditions for nickel production in the object .",
    "for example , if accretion disk outflows are to be a significant fraction of the overall grb nickel production , the contribution of other processes , such as magnetic heating , to the entropy increase in the outflow from @xmath64 disks should not greatly exceed that of the neutrino interactions .",
    "however , conclusions about the mass fraction of nickel produced can not be drawn from the entropy alone .",
    "nickel formation is optimized when the outflow timescale , in particular the ratio of @xmath58 in the outflow , is fast at the beginning stages of nucleosynthesis and slow later .",
    "furthermore , in the models considered here , outflows from an intermediate disk radius , @xmath89 km , more efficiently produced nickel than material ejected closer to the black hole . under the optimal conditions up",
    "to around 50% of the material ejected from black hole accretion disks will become nickel-56 .",
    "these results , when coupled with future wind model calculations and observations , can ultimately be used to constrain the outflow conditions of grb disks .",
