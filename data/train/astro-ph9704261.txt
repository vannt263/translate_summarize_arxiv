    "one of the primary goals of cosmology is a complete characterization of the seeds that led to the formation of structure . from an accurate understanding of the statistics of fluctuations",
    "we may be able to glean information about the physical origin of these seeds , their evolution and even find a precise measure of the parameters that characterize the space - time on which they live .",
    "a laboratory from which we can obtain detailed estimates is supplied by the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "much effort has focused on optimal estimates of the fluctuations power spectrum given the harsh realities of experimental data ; one is faced with foreground contamination , incomplete sky coverage , and instrumental noise , which have to be incorporated into data analysis .",
    "a simplifying assumption has been that fluctuations in the cmb are gaussian , allowing the development of sophisticated techniques for estimating cosmological parameters .    with current developments in experimental cmb physics",
    ", we will now be in a position to analyse very large data sets , with information about large patches of the sky measured with very high resolution and sensitivity .",
    "this means that we are in a position to seriously test some of the assumptions that have gone into the techniques that have been developed , in particular , whether the sky is really gaussian .",
    "if the sky is gaussian indeed , then current techniques for estimating the power spectrum will become watertight methods . should deviations from non - gaussianity be detected , clearly one should start again .",
    "furthermore the power spectrum would then not be the end of the story in the quest for a statistical characterization of the fluctuations .    in the past",
    "this task has been tackled in a variety of ways subject to very different philosophies .",
    "one approach has been to choose a statistic which is easy to describe for a gaussian random field and then try to quantify , by means of this statistic , what are the chances that a given data set comes from an underlying gaussian ensemble .",
    "the well known examples are peaks statistics @xcite , topological tests @xcite , the 3-point correlation function @xcite and skewness and kurtosis @xcite .",
    "another approach has been to devise statistics which are good discriminators between gaussian skies and specific non - gaussian rivals .",
    "such is the case in much of the techniques involved in looking for topological defects @xcite , such as strings and textures or even foregrounds , such as point sources .",
    "these approaches have their merits .",
    "non - gaussian tests are very easy to implement even in the context of very large data sets .",
    "also reducing the whole issue to a single statistic allows one to concentrate on devising the statistic ideally suited for detecting a given , pre - known , type of non - gaussianity .",
    "this is somewhat reminiscent of pattern recognition : if we already know what we are looking for , we may improve our chance of detecting an existing predefined pattern inside a noisy data - set .",
    "one can , however , take a more humble approach , which is to admit that we have little idea of what the underlying probability distribution function of the cmb is .",
    "it then becomes necessary to devise as complete a framework as possible , without prejudices with regards to testing rival models , or ease of computation with regards to testing non - gaussianity .",
    "this is an alternative approach , which supports as its underlying philosophy the quest for ruling out or detecting @xmath0 non - gaussianity .",
    "the most well established formalism following this alternative philosophy is the _",
    "n - point formalism_. we briefly describe this formalism .",
    "consider the cmb anisotropies , @xmath1 to be statistically isotropic random field , defined on the sky .",
    "we consider cmb data in the small angle limit , when projecting onto a planar patch is suitable .",
    "since data may come in either real or fourier space we want to address the problem of non - gaussianity in terms of both representations .",
    "we shall use the convention : @xmath2 the @xmath3-point correlation function is defined as the expectation value of the product of any @xmath3 temperatures .",
    "translational and rotational invariance make redundant the position of one of the points and the direction of another .",
    "hence the @xmath3-point function may be written as a function of @xmath4 in the form @xmath5 the 2-point correlation function and its fourier transform , the angular power spectrum @xmath6 , are well - known .",
    "the angular power spectrum may be generalized for @xmath7 by fourier analysing the @xmath3-point function @xmath8 in spite of all its success it is argued in @xcite that this framework is not systematic and is plagued by redundancy . in principle , one can calculate an infinite number of n - point functions , and there is no criteria where to truncate such an evaluation .",
    "if one has a finite data set , then many of these quantities will be algebraically dependent on each other .",
    "there is a practical additional problem : to estimate the m - point correlation function , one needs @xmath9 operations , clearly a large number for the expected large data - sets .",
    "a possible remedy to these problems was outlined in @xcite .",
    "here we follow up on this work , but along a rather different angle .",
    "we wish to set up a practical non - redundant formalism for encoding generic non - gaussianity , but to start with all we define are the requirements an ideal such formalism would satisfy .",
    "we then look at the formats in which data comes , and within the available descriptions we try to accommodate our requirements the best we can .",
    "the outcome is necessarily an eclectic mixture of techniques .",
    "these , we hope , will be practical devices subject to as little prejudice as possible .",
    "five major requirements will ensure that the chosen quantities afford a sensible statistical description of the random field . depending on the particular data set available , and on the particular theory one beloves",
    ", one may give more or less emphasis to each of these requirements .",
    "an essential requirement is that any statistic one defines is rotationally and translationally invariant . if we define our data set to be a set of pixels @xmath10 and the statistic @xmath11 to be a functional then @xmath12={\\cal g}[\\delta t({\\bf x})]\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the reason underlying this criterion is the assumption that the cmb can be described as a statistically isotropic random field .",
    "the ensemble of all data sets @xmath10 remains the same under rotations and translations .",
    "therefore it is convenient to define statistics which , when applied on a given realization , do not change if rotations and translations are performed upon this realization . by doing",
    "so we are probing more realizations in the ensemble , since the ensemble , being isotropic , replicates each realization into all the realizations related by the symmetry transformation .",
    "a good example of this requirement being enforced is the angular power spectrum @xmath13 which is independent of the way in which the axes are defined .",
    "this requirement is essential in the standard big bang cosmology and within all - sky experiments , but there may be grounds for dropping it otherwise",
    ". if we look at small patches of the sky , then the existence of an observation window is already breaking the translational and rotational invariance .",
    "also a few examples of fundamentally anisotropic fluctuations have been discussed in the past @xcite .    in the light of this argument",
    "we shall enforce this requirement in the construction in section iv but not in the construction in section v.      another requirement is that any set of statistics that one defines is made up of quantities which , for a gaussian theory , are statistically independent , and that one of these quantities be the power spectrum ( which completely describes a gaussian theory ) .",
    "in fact if some of the quantities we define are dependent then we are over counting degrees of freedom along which the theory is allowed to be non - gaussian .    such a framework was proposed in @xcite , where one provides a transformation from the fourier space values of the temperature anisotropies into a complete set of independent quantities .",
    "this has the advantage of identifying the correct amount of information that one can correctly assess from a finite data set .",
    "this requirement may however be satisfied in practice , for large data sets , even if not in theory by the formalism .",
    "a large data set will be an assumption we shall make in this paper in order to satisfy this criterion .",
    "it has become clear that different physical processes are important on different physical scales .",
    "these different processes may have very different statistical properties .",
    "for example , the distribution of point sources will be a poisson process , while for high wavenumbers the surface of last scattering will have an exponentially suppressed power spectrum .",
    "if one were to look at the sky at sub arc minute scales , any given pixel would be the sum of these two gaussian and non - gaussian distributions .",
    "it is often the case that the gaussian component dominates the non - gaussian one on some scales but not on others .",
    "it is therefore desirable to define statistics which are scale dependent . in the application given in the section",
    "vi we show how this feature may be decisive in the ability of any statistic to pick subtle non - gaussian features .      it may be useful if the statistics we define are additive , in the sense that if @xmath14 and @xmath15 are maps coming from two independent random processes then the statistic @xmath11 will satisfy @xmath16= { \\cal g}[\\delta t_1({\\bf x})]+{\\cal g}[\\delta t_2({\\bf x})]\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] lack of additivity is one of the shortcomings of the formalism in @xcite .",
    "additivity may be useful firstly because one may sometimes want to combine information on different scales .",
    "for instance a given effect may be present in a band of scales , within which the power spectrum may vary , rather than in just a single scale .",
    "for instance in @xcite one finds a set of transverse spectra which in the language of @xmath17 complement the power spectrum @xmath13 ( which tells us how much power there is on the scale @xmath18 ) with a transverse spectrum @xmath19 , which tells us how the power on the scale @xmath18 is distributed in angle @xmath20 .",
    "such an approach has the problem that few modes may then contribute to the @xmath19 .",
    "better still would be to find a truly transverse spectrum @xmath21 which would average over a certain range of scales @xmath18 for a fixed direction @xmath20 .",
    "such a @xmath21 spectrum would be truly orthogonal to the power spectrum @xmath13 description .",
    "such construction can not be provided by @xcite because the quantities defined there are not additive . for additive statistics",
    ", however , extending non - gaussian spectra over scales to non - gaussian spectra over bands of scales is a trivial operation .",
    "such a construction is described in section  [ fouriers ] .",
    "another motivation for additivity comes from networks of non - gaussian structures which are a poisson process of individual non - gaussian structures .",
    "such networks are often globally complicated but their individual components are simple .",
    "for instance a cosmic string network is a bit of a mess globally , but is made up of essentially simple elements , say segments of brownian strings .",
    "it is for this reason that the formalism in @xcite is really better suited for small fields , where the number of non - gaussian objects is never larger than one . for a large field @xcite",
    "provides a rather complicated description . again",
    "an additive statistic would not encounter this problem .",
    "if the individual object has a simple description within the formalism , then the same would be true for a network of such objects . another way to phrase",
    "this concern is to say that it is useful to define statistics sensitive to local rather than global features .",
    "we will show in section vi this criterion at work in the context of point source subtraction .",
    "point sources in large fields are globally complicated but locally extremely simple .",
    "we shall enforce this criterion in this context by combining two tools .",
    "firstly we shall make use of additive cumulants .",
    "secondly we shall introduce the concept of scale by means of the local wavelet transform .",
    "there are practical considerations . as mentioned above ,",
    "estimating higher order statistics within the n - point formalism is very demanding on computation capabilities .",
    "one needs efficient methods which will be manageable with future million pixel data sets and available computer resources .",
    "related to this issue is the quest for comprehensive but non - redundant statistics .",
    "this is sometimes a problem .",
    "one can show that a distribution may be gaussian up to a very large moment and then be non - gaussian ( although the opposite is not possible , see @xcite ) .",
    "an infinite and largely repetitive series of moments is therefore required for completeness .",
    "we will see however how cosmic variance provides a natural cut - off for what in principle is a infinite series of statistics .",
    "the idea is that if cosmic variance goes above a given level there is no practical way in which we could detect non - gaussianity , given the fact that we only have one sky .      as one would expect , it is difficult to reconcile all these requirements . some of them are even incompatible .",
    "for example , statistical independence leads one to work in fourier space , where statistical isotropy and homogeneity enforce statistical independence of the different modes . on the other hand ,",
    "fourier space is a very non - local transformation , and so any statistic defined in fourier space will be sensitive to the global properties of the sample . as stated before this may entail the awkward recognition of globally complicated networks of essentially simple components . enforcing translational invariance , while keeping additivity , is also impossible to do in fourier space",
    ".    we will start from a simple idea : to refine the notion of one point distribution function of @xmath22 in such a way as to incorporate as many of these requirements as possible .",
    "the fundamental idea is to calculate cumulants , or combinations of cumulants defined on various transforms on the data sets .",
    "depending on the priorities , these transforms will be in real space or fourier space .",
    "there are different ways in which this simple idea may be implemented .",
    "different alternative will lead to favouring some of the above properties over others .",
    "it will be instructive to consider a few alternatives .",
    "we will take as our starting point the one - point distribution function of @xmath22 .",
    "if we were to consider an ensemble of realizations , we would be able to characterize this distribution completely . by inspecting the @xmath1 histogram of realizations one",
    "can then see if the distribution function is gaussian or not .",
    "however , the histogram is but a graphical device . the algebraic statement corresponding to this non - gaussianity test consists of studying the cumulants .",
    "the cumulants of a sample ( or of a distribution ) are first introduced in an attempt to achieve additivity .",
    "we can define the @xmath23 moment of the @xmath1 distribution to be @xmath24 and from eq .",
    "( [ eq : npoint ] ) we see that @xmath25 .",
    "the moments , if they exist , fully quantify the distribution as they appear as coefficients in the taylor expansion of the characteristic function @xmath26 ( the characteristic is essentially the fourier transform of the distribution function ) .",
    "the characteristic satisfies @xmath27 and so the @xmath28 can not be generally additive .",
    "the idea behind the definition of cumulants consists of writing down polynomials in the @xmath28 which are additive , @xmath29 .",
    "the prescription is defined in @xcite and consists simply of taking the logarithm of the characteristic @xmath30 .",
    "then @xmath31 .",
    "if @xmath32 is expanded in power series one obtains , as coefficients , a series of additive moments or cumulants @xmath33 .",
    "moments and cumulants may be related by comparing the expansions of @xmath32 and @xmath34 . in general cumulants",
    "may be obtained from the moments using @xmath35 where the indices @xmath36 must satisfy @xmath37 . at this point one notices that we get more than what we bargained for . for a gaussian @xmath38 and",
    "so the cumulants of a gaussian must be zero for @xmath39 .",
    "this is an added benefit over the moments , which are not zero for a gaussian for even orders , but instead have the relatively complicated spectrum of values : @xmath40 formula ( [ eq : cumdef ] ) is not the best way to compute cumulants from the moments .",
    "an efficient algorithm is given in @xcite , where it is shown that @xmath41 dimensionless quantities may be constructed out of the cumulants @xmath42 of which the familiar @xmath43 and @xmath44 are known as the skewness and kurtosis .",
    "the quantities @xmath33 and @xmath45 have two useful properties , regardless of the sample on which they are defined .",
    "firstly they are zero for a gaussian probability distribution function .",
    "if one considers the @xmath45s then one can quantify this in a way which is independent of the power spectrum .",
    "secondly the @xmath33s are are additive .",
    "this means that if @xmath46 is the sum of many different processes , its cumulants will be the sum of the cumulants of each process .",
    "one ca nt have both of these properties , and depending on the situation we will opt to work with @xmath33 or @xmath45 .",
    "there are a few subtleties which should be considered when working with these statistics and we will bear them in mind throughout the paper .",
    "firstly , care must be taken when estimating these quantities from a limited sample .",
    "the simplest procedure is to define first estimators for the moments @xmath47 where hat denotes an estimator and @xmath48 is the number of pixels used in the estimation .",
    "we can then use eq .",
    "( [ eq : cumdef ] ) or ( [ eq : det ] ) to define estimators for the cumulants @xmath49 .",
    "it turns out that these estimators are nt centered , i.e. @xmath50 for a gaussian distribution .",
    "the value of the bias is a function of @xmath48 and in the case where one has large @xmath48 this is not a problem . on the other hand , for small samples",
    ", one can construct unbiased centered estimators of the cumulants using what are known as @xmath51-statistics .",
    "the idea is to bypass estimating the moments and define polynomials in the @xmath46 which do average to the cumulants . for the purpose of this paper",
    "we will always consider the large n limit . in the discussion we will consider the limitations of such an assumption .",
    "there is an interesting , well known connection that can be made between cumulants and the connected greens functions of statistical physics . in the latter case one",
    "is interested in quantifying the corrections that will be introduced if one modifies a gaussian theory ( a theory where the action can be written as a gaussian functional on the fundamental fields ) by introducing modifications .",
    "this can be done by looking at the connected greens functions of the theory , which are simply the difference between each green s function of the non - gaussian theory and the green s function of that order if one assumes the theory is gaussian ( using wick s theorem ) .",
    "the cumulants will be the zero lag values of these connected green s functions .",
    "finally , there is one important point that must be addressed which may be a shortcoming of any technique which uses cumulants as the basis of non - gaussianity .",
    "if we work out the covariance matrix for cumulants we find that it is not strictly diagonal .",
    "however we find that @xmath52 the structure of the off - diagonal terms is simple to understand , in light of wick s theorem : if @xmath53 is odd , covariance is strictly zero while if @xmath53 is even , it is proportional to @xmath54 .",
    "this means that in the limit of large @xmath48 ( the realm of large data sets we are considering in this paper ) the set of cumulants are a set of independent quantifiers of non - gaussianity .",
    "the structure of the covariance matrix also gives us a prescription at which we can truncate , in @xmath55 the set of cumulants we should calculate for a given data set . by defining a maximum variance allowed we constrain @xmath56 to be less than some value , thereby truncating the cumulants series at some value @xmath55 .",
    "having defined cumulants we now address the issue of the sample on which they should be computed .",
    "this depends largely on the type of data one starts from and even so there are several avenues that could be pursued . in this section",
    "we will work towards a framework within which to work with cumulants whenever the data is provided in real space .",
    "we are interested in probing the statistical properties of the data set at different scales , in such a way that the statistics at different scales are independent of each other as well as attempting to make them sensitive to local properties of the map .    as a first attempt at quantifying the properties of the one point distribution function one",
    "can estimate the cumulants of the pixels of one data set . defining the estimators for the moments as above ,",
    "one finds that statistical dependence of the data points increases the variance of each estimator .",
    "it can be shown that the largest term in @xmath57 in the variance of these estimators is modified by a factor .",
    "i.e. we have @xmath58 where @xmath59 @xmath60 is defined to be @xmath61 where v is the sample area and @xmath62 is the correspnding window function .",
    "this is clearly a problem : the pixels are correlated and therefore the effective number of independent pixels is smaller than the actual number of pixels .    as discussed in the introduction , statistical isotropy , homogeneity and gaussianity lead to the statistical independence of @xmath46 for different wavenumbers .",
    "it is also natural to expect that different physical processes will predominate at different scales .",
    "so ultimately one would like to define a statistics out of the cumulants which are scale dependent . in",
    "the following we present three alternatives and argue that the last one has the most advantages      we would like to define a linear transformation that will take the data and filter out everything but the scales of interest .",
    "we shall consider the simplest case for the moment : a real space filter which filters everything but a band of width @xmath63 around a wave - mode @xmath64 . in fourier space",
    "this corresponds to a top - hat function @xmath65 the corresponding transformation in real space is given by @xmath66+\\frac{\\sigma}{2}[j_1(q_+r)-j_1(q_-r)]\\ } \\label{eq : win}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath67 if we want to keep the number of modes constant _ per _ ring , we have @xmath68 , i.e. @xmath48 constant .",
    "the procedure can then be the folowing : given a dataset with a certain number of pixels and geometry , we can identify the number of independent scales to be probed . for simple geometries",
    "this is straightforward ( the size and nyquist frequency give us the range of modes allowed ) .",
    "for each wavenumber we perform this transformation using window function eq .",
    "[ eq : win ] to obtain a new set of values withthe same size as the original .",
    "we then define estimators of the moments using eq .",
    "[ eq : mom ] and find the cumulants using eq .",
    "[ eq : det ] .",
    "this quantites have some of the desired properties .",
    "firstly they are stratifying the information in terms of scales and quantifying the non - gaussianity in these bands in wavenumber . secondly ,",
    "both the convolution and the estimators are rotationally invariant so the final results are independent of the axis of orientation on which you are working .",
    "thirdly , the window functions are chosen to be orthogonal , so one can decouple the information between rings .",
    "so for a given two rings with different wavenumbers , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , the cumulants of one ring , @xmath71 , will be independent of the cumulants of the other , @xmath72 .",
    "there are strong shortcomings with this approach however .",
    "firstly it is a highly non - local operation on the data set .",
    "the fourier transform will is very sensitive to the global properties and geometry of the data and it is difficult to separate out what is truly non - gaussian and what is due to large scale sampling effects . of course",
    "this just means that one has to be careful when analysing the cumulants of the large wavelength modes but any form of anisotropy in the sky coverage may corrupt this analysis down to very small scales .",
    "secondly it is a very inefficient transformation . for each wavenumber",
    "we produce a set of n points on which we define the estimators .",
    "the fact that the statistics is defined on these n points is misleading : for a filter with a wavenumber @xmath69 one should have approximately @xmath73 independent points , much less than n. this will manifest itself if we introduce the correction into eq .",
    "[ eq : samdep ] with @xmath74 replaced by @xmath75 where @xmath76 indicates convolution .",
    "we are interested in defining a set of linear transformations that filter information in fourier space but at the same time keep information about localization .",
    "we can see the fourier representation as one extreme , where we operate on the whole data - set , so that each fourier value is very non - local .",
    "the other extreme is configuration space representation , where the basis vectors are @xmath77-functions on the pixels .",
    "there is a framework within which one can have basis functions which are both localized in fourier space and in real space .",
    "these are called wavelets @xcite . in brief",
    "the idea is the following .",
    "one can expand a function @xmath78 in terms of a set of basis functions : @xmath79 where the index @xmath80 labels the frequency band one is exploring , and the label @xmath81 labels the position band one is probing .",
    "these functions are compactly or almost compactly supported in real space , so they evaluate local features .",
    "one can construct these functions from a basic building block , the _ parent _ function , @xmath82 through a set of translations and dilations .",
    "this parent function must satisfy an admissibility condition @xmath83 a good example , for our purpose is that of the maar wavelet in two dimensions : @xmath84 to generate a family of functions with the same features we define @xmath85 a transform of the data is then @xmath86 the transform is isotropic and one can estimate , given a mode @xmath69 that the numebr of points @xmath87 one should obtain is @xmath88 , much less than in the previous section .",
    "it is also true that the quasicompact support of these functions avoid problems with the irregular geometries that one faces with just a straight fourier transform . for a given wavenumber one simply packs the transformed regions in such a way as to avoid the boundaries .",
    "although this is a considerable improvement in many respects to a full fourier transform there is one problem .",
    "as yet there is no systematic way of defining an orthonormal set of functions .",
    "the prescription described above will generate a very large number of basis functions which are all interdependent .",
    "this means that , if we define the cumulants for each band in wavenumber and use eq .",
    "[ eq : mom ] where we replace the sum over pixels by the sum over the spatial coefficients of the transform ( the @xmath89 in eq .",
    "[ eq : cwt ] ) then not only will cumulants within one ring be correlated , but cumulants within adjacent rings will be correlated .",
    "it turns out that there is framework within which one construct an orthonormal set of functions .",
    "one can define a set of functions in one dimension : @xmath90 where @xmath91 satisfies the admissability condition in one dimension .",
    "these functions are orthonormal . to complete the basis one needs an additional function which satisfies @xmath92 to contain information about the low frequency modes .",
    "then any function can be expanded in terms of @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "there is a certain freedom in constructing such a set of functions but daubechies has proposed an efficient algorithm for such a purpose , which we shall outline . to define @xmath91 and",
    "@xmath95 one can solve a set of equations : latexmath:[\\ ] ] and in fig  [ exc ] we present a contour plot for both these quantities . clearly for large wavenumbers , ( for @xmath165 ) , the non - gaussian distribution has a large excess variance as compared to the gaussian one ( @xmath166 becomes less than @xmath167 very rapidly ) . for small wavenumbers",
    "there is confusion .",
    "the fact that we can pick up such a large difference is due to the fact that we are looking at the scales where the non - gaussian signal dominates _ and _ we are using a set of statistics which preserves local information .",
    "if we now focus on a band at high wavenumbers we can see the difference between the two distributions in more detail .",
    "it is useful to define @xmath168 note that , for a gaussian distribution , the variance of @xmath169 should be proportional to @xmath170 while the variance of @xmath171 is one . in fig .",
    "[ var ] we plot the @xmath172 confidence regions for these two quantities for @xmath173 .",
    "the excess variance , again is manifest and there is a strong signal of non - gaussianity .    from fig .",
    "[ var ] we can see that there is a value of @xmath55 for which the two bands do not overlap .",
    "it corresponds to the ( appropriately normalized ) kurtosis of the distribution .",
    "if we concentrate on @xmath174 as a function of scale we see that , as we expect , for low wavenumbers the two distributions are indistinguishable while for wavenumbers larger than @xmath175 there is a large discrepancy ( see fig.5 ) .",
    "the same can not be said about @xmath176 , the skewness .",
    "one may learn important lessons from this example .",
    "introducing a scale into our statistics was clearly a good idea . making a pure histogram of pixels",
    "was found hopeless , but filtering the data into a hierarchy of scales allowed the recognition of the point sources , by inspecting the appropriate band of scales . in that band",
    "two types of fingerprints were found for point sources .",
    "for the kurtosis there is clearly a positive average , with no overlapping cosmic variance error bars with a gaussian process . for",
    "higer order cumulants the signal is more subtle .",
    "although these cumulants still average to zero they show an abnormally large spread . therefore in most realizations one would find a value for the cumulant well outside the gaussian cosmic variance error bar , even though averaging over realization still leaves a zero cumulant .",
    "this is an example of a situation where the variance errorbar is more important than the average quantity .",
    "these two signatures are clear and strong indications of the point source non - gaussianity .",
    "another important lesson is the advantage of recognizing local rather than global features .",
    "the signatures found above do not get complicated by adding more and more point sources .",
    "they are essentially dependent only on the non - gaussian features of the individual structures .",
    "this is an advantage over the treatment of point sources given in @xcite , which was really only simply when there was a single point source inside the field ( a situation common in the very small field context analyzed in that paper ) .",
    "the non - gaussian spectra defined in @xcite recognize global rather than local shapes .",
    "hence if there were many point sources in the field they would recognize the angles between the lines connecting the various point sources , and the lenghts of all the segments , rather than the point sources themselves .",
    "for instance if there were three point sources in the field the formalism would react to the shape and size of the triangle depicted .",
    "this is naturally a complete mess for a poisson process , even though the individual objects are very simple .",
    "the formalism used in this section , on the other hand , always recognizes individual structures .",
    "this is achieved both by the use of the wavelet transform , and the use of additive cumulants , and is a desirable feature whenever the trees are simple but the forest is complex .",
    "in this paper we have developed a new technique for quantifying non - gaussianity using cumulants .",
    "although in section  [ fouriers ] we have discussed the possibility of using these quantities on interferometric data , we have focused on applying it to real space data . in this setting we have defined a set of statistics which are scale dependent , rotationally invariant and which are computationally easy to evaluate . in the limit of large data sets they are statistically independent for a gaussian random field .",
    "one has the option of working with power spectrum independent quantities or additive quantities depending on preferences .",
    "this work is the first step in defining a useful set of statistics for analysing the future large data sets from ground and space based cmb experiments .",
    "the next steps are obvious and we shall discuss the prospects of each .    we have taken the large@xmath177 limit of our data sets and this has allowed us to define simple estimators and find the simple structure of the covariance matrix in eq .",
    "[ covcu ] .",
    "although this is the case of satellite experiments , ground based experiments in the near future may not satisfy this condition .",
    "it becomes necessary then to analyse the case of moderate @xmath48 and a number of problems arise . to begin with the estimators defined in eq .",
    "[ eq : mom ] are biased and not centred .",
    "this means that the @xmath49s wo nt have zero expectation values for a gaussian process .",
    "however , as mentioned above there is a standard procedure for dealing with this using @xmath178statistics , i.e. defining statistics which have the correct expectation value .",
    "the problem then arises that the covariance matrix loses its simple form .",
    "in particular the off - diagonal terms become non - negligible . in the same way that the dependence in @xmath55 and @xmath48 gave us a criteria for truncating the number of moments to calculate",
    ", one can now impose the condition of effective diagonalization .",
    "i.e by defining a how large the off - diagonal terms are allowed to be relative to the diagonal one again obtains a constraint on @xmath55 given @xmath48 .",
    "an alternative , slightly more convoluted approach is to construct linear combinations of the @xmath49 so that the covariance matrix becomes diagonal .",
    "the interpretation of these new quantities is less clear .",
    "the formalism we have developed is applicable in the small angle limit , when the sky can be approximated by a plane . given the existence of an all sky data set ( from the cobe satellite ) and the expected results from the planned satellite missions , it is necessary to extend this construction to the spherical spaces .",
    "although there has been some progress in developing wavelet techniques on arbitrary surfaces , work on fast discrete wavelet transforms in such setting is still in its infancy .",
    "there have been some proposals @xcite and the current rate of progress is such that efficient algorithms will be available in the near future .    we have considered a simple example with which to illustrate our technique . in considering a non - gaussian signal from a distribution of point sources",
    "we have made contact with the @xmath144 approach of @xcite .",
    "indeed , as mentioned in section  [ cuhi ] cumulants are the algebraic way of characterizing a distribution . by looking at the @xmath144 one is essentially looking at a histogram of temperature fluctuations and as we have argued , calculating the cumulants is the natural next step .",
    "we have restricted ourselves to the two dimensional fields of temperature anisotropies .",
    "however the estimators we have defined here can be defined in any dimensions .",
    "such situations have been explored in @xcite where the statistical properties of ly@xmath179 clouds ( one dimensional data sets ) were studied in some detail .",
    "one could also envisage performing the same sort of analysis on three dimensional fields , such as the distribution of matter in the universe @xcite . indeed with the planned large scale surveys of galaxies it should be possible to characterize the distribution of density perturbation with unprecedented precision .",
