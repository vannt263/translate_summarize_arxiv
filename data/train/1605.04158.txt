    "transitions inducted by thermal fluctuations in atomic systems such as chemical reactions , diffusion events and configurational changes are often much less frequent than atomic vibrations . in order to estimate the rate of such rare events",
    ", a direct dynamical simulation requires much too long a simulation time while a statistical approach can be applied because of the separation of time scales .",
    "the rate theory developed by eyring and polanyi  @xcite and , in a different form , by pelzer and wigner  @xcite for chemical reactions , can be applied in many different contexts .",
    "we will refer to this as transition state theory ( tst ) .",
    "it provides a method for estimating the rate of rare events by performing a statistical average over the fast , oscillatory motion and focuses on the probability of significant transitions . a key concept there is the transition state , the region of configurational space representing a bottleneck for the transition and corresponding to a free energy barrier .",
    "the basic assumption of tst is that the transition state is only crossed once .",
    "if the system makes it to the transition state and is heading away from the initial state , it is assumed that the trajectory ends up in a product state for an extended period of time , before a possible back - reaction can occur .",
    "this approximation can then be checked and corrected by calculating short time trajectories started at the transition state to obtain the so called recrossing ( or dynamical ) correction  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that tst gives an overestimate of the transition rate and the correction factor is @xmath0 .",
    "if the transition state is variationally optimised  @xcite , the correction factor is as close to unity as possible .",
    "this two - step procedure for obtaining the value of the rate offers great advantage over the direct calculation of the rate from trajectories starting at the initial state .",
    "it can take an impossibly long time to simulate even one such reactive trajectory , while the trajectories needed for the correction to the tst estimate are short since they start at the transition state .",
    "we will refer to this approach as the two step wigner - keck - eyring ( wke ) procedure  @xcite .",
    "the tst estimate of a transition rate requires , in general , the evaluation of the free energy of the system using some thermal sampling .",
    "but , a simpler approach is to apply a harmonic approximation where the rate is estimated by identifying the maximum energy along the minimum energy path of the transition .",
    "this point corresponds to a first order saddle point on the energy surface and gives the activation energy .",
    "the entropic prefactor is obtained by evaluating the vibrational modes at the saddle point and at the initial state minimum .",
    "this simplified version of tst is referred to as harmonic transition state theory ( htst ) @xcite .",
    "a recrossing of the transition state can occur for two different reasons .",
    "one is the fluctuating force acting on the system due to the heat bath .",
    "if such a force is large enough and acts in the direction opposite to the velocity of the system soon after it has crossed the transition state , the system can go back through the transition state to the part of configuration space corresponding to the initial state .",
    "the other reason for a recrossing of the transition state is related to the shape of the potential energy surface .",
    "if the reaction path is curved near the transition state the system can enter a repulsive region that creates a force on the system that sends it back to the initial state .",
    "the more recrossings that occur , the smaller @xmath1 becomes .",
    "the recrossings are particularly important if the energy along the reaction path in the region near the transition state is relatively constant , i.e the energy barrier is flat .",
    "a different approach to the estimation of thermal transition rates was developed by kramers @xcite and later generalised to multidimensional systems by langer @xcite .",
    "there , a harmonic approximation to the energy surface is used and a statistical estimate is made for the recrossings due to the fluctuating force from the heat bath .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that some of the recrossings are taken into account in the rate estimate without requiring a dynamical recrossing correction .",
    "a disadvantage as compared to the two step wke procedure is that some of the recrossings are not included , in particular not the ones resulting from the shape of the potential energy surface .",
    "another disadvantage of the kramers / langer approach is a harmonic approximation of the energy surface in the direction of the reaction path at the transition state .",
    "as a result , the rate is estimated to vanish if the energy barrier is flat , i.e. if the second derivative of the energy along the reaction path is zero .",
    "such flat top energy barriers can occur in various applications .",
    "one example of a flat barrier problem is the transition of a polymer from a potential well , the so - called polymer escape problem @xcite",
    ". experimental examples of systems of this sort include polymer translocation @xcite , where a polymer is crossing a membrane through a pore @xcite , or narrow @xmath2m - scale channels with traps @xcite .",
    "recent experiments by liu _",
    "_ involve the escape of a dna molecule from an entropic cage @xcite .",
    "similar translocation and escape processes are common in cell biology and have possible bioengineering applications , such as dna sequencing @xcite and biopolymer filtration @xcite .    in a recent study of a model polymer escape problem ,",
    "the application of htst followed by dynamical corrections was shown to give accurate results as compared to direct dynamical simulations , while the kramers - langer approach gave a significant underestimate of the transition rate for the longer polymers @xcite .",
    "flat energy barriers are also common in magnetic transitions involving the temporary domain wall mechanism @xcite",
    ".    the evaluation of the recrossing correction in the wke procedure can involve large computational effort for extended , flat energy barriers .",
    "this occurs , for example , for the escape of long polymers that are long enough to stretch between the initial and final state energy wells while the polymer beads undergo diffusive motion back and forth over the barrier .",
    "well established procedures exist for the evaluation of the recrossing correction from trajectories that start and the transition state and eventually make it to either the final state or back to the initial state ( see , for example , ref .",
    "[ voter1985 ] ) .",
    "however , the diffusive motion along the flat energy barrier can make such trajectories long and the calculation computationally demanding .",
    "we present here an approach for calculating the recrossing correction in such challenging problems by using a procedure that is similar to so - called forward flux sampling ( ffs ) @xcite where a sequence of hyperplanes is constructed and trajectories are calculated to estimate the probability that the system advances from one hyperplane to the next . while the ffs method has been proposed as a way to calculate transition rates starting from the initial state and ending at a final state",
    ", we start the hyperplane sequence at the transition state and evaluate the probability that the system makes it all the way to the final state given that it starts at the transition state .",
    "this turns out to be a more efficient procedure than the standard method for evaluating the recrossing correction by calculating individual trajectories that make it all the way from the transition state to the final state @xcite .",
    "we present results on the computational efficiency of these different methods for estimating the escape rates of polymers with up to 64 beads , where there is a pronounced flat barrier .",

    "a trajectory is taken to have reached the final state when the centre of mass is half way between the maximum and the final state minimum , @xmath29 . if @xmath30 is the time of the escape event occurring in trajectory @xmath31 , then the thermally averaged probability that a transition has occurred after time @xmath7 is @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the number of trajectories simulated , and @xmath34 the heaviside step function . the escape rate",

    "the initial flux is calculated by simulating a long trajectory in the initial state for a time @xmath43 and counting the number of crossings @xmath44 of the first hyperplane , @xmath40 , with the normal component of the velocity pointing towards the final state .",
    "therefore , the initial flux is @xmath45 .    the configuration at each of the crossing events of the @xmath40 hyperplane serves as an initial configuration for a new trajectory which is run until the next interface @xmath46 is reached , or the trajectory returns to the initial state by crossing @xmath40 .",

    "the evaluation of the htst estimate of the escape rate requires finding the first order saddle point on the energy surface defining the transition state and evaluating the vibrational frequencies from eigenvalues of the hessian at the saddle point and the initial state minimum . in order to find the saddle point , the nudged elastic band ( neb ) method @xcite",
