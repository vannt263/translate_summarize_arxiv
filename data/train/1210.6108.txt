    "properties of hyperon resonances are important to understand role of strangeness in hadron physics .",
    "especially , understanding of hyperon resonances located below the @xmath10 threshold , such as @xmath11 and @xmath12 , is essential for physics of strangeness in nuclear matter and nuclei .",
    "in addition , because baryonic resonances decay into mesons and a baryon in strong interactions , one can learn basic interactions between hadrons with strangeness from the properties of hyperon resonances .    among the various hyperon resonances , recent attention is particularly focused on the @xmath11 hyperon resonance with @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the @xmath11 resonance has been considered for long time as a quasibound state of @xmath15  @xcite , being extremely important resonance to understand @xmath15 interaction .",
    "theoretically , @xmath11 is successfully reproduced as dynamically generated states in coupled - channels approach based on chiral dynamics  @xcite , and this approach has confirmed that the @xmath11 is predominantly described by meson - baryon components  @xcite .",
    "recently it has been also pointed out in ref .  @xcite that the @xmath11 is composed by two resonance states having different coupling nature and that the one which dominantly couples to the @xmath15 channel is located at 1420 mev instead of nominal 1405 mev . since the resonance position of the @xmath11 in the @xmath15 channel",
    "is strongly related to the strength of the @xmath15 interaction , it is very important to observe @xmath11 spectra in the @xmath16 channel and pin down the resonance position of the @xmath11 seen below the @xmath15 threshold .",
    "several ideas to observe the @xmath11 initiated by the @xmath17 channel have been proposed in refs .",
    "one of the promising ways to form the @xmath11 in the @xmath15 channel is to use nuclear reactions with @xmath1 beam , such as in - flight @xmath18 , as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , in which fermi motion of nucleon and @xmath19 multi - scattering with nucleons help to create @xmath11 by @xmath15 below its threshold . in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been found that , in the @xmath20 reaction with intermediate @xmath1 beam energy , @xmath11 production dominantly takes place in double scattering process , in which the incoming @xmath1 kicks one of the nucleons in deuteron in forward direction and looses its energy suitably to form @xmath11 with the other nucleon .",
    "although a single scattering process also contributes to the @xmath11 production , for energetic incoming @xmath1 with several hundreds mev@xmath21 in the laboratory frame the contribution is small due to insufficient fermi motion of nucleon in deuteron .",
    "in addition , thanks to the fact that strangeness is brought into the system by the incoming @xmath1 , @xmath11 is formed selectively by the @xmath15 channel by the @xmath22 channel would take place by multi - pion exchange between two baryons . however , multi - pion exchange processes are absolutely negligible for the resonance formation with in - flight @xmath1 . ] .",
    "this is a good advantage over @xmath11 productions induced by a nonstrange particle , in which strangeness has to be created in the reaction process and can be carried by the baryon producing @xmath11 .",
    "in fact , there has been already an old bubble - chember experiment observing @xmath11 in @xmath23 at @xmath1 momenta between 686 and 844 mev / c  @xcite .",
    "although the statistics was not so high , the experiment found clearly that the @xmath11 spectrum has a peak at 1420 mev .",
    "forthcoming experiments in j - parc with high - intensity kaon beam are expected for more detailed and precise information on the properties of @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "recently it has been pointed out in ref .",

    "@xcite would break the three - body unitarity . later in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors have proposed several options for the kaon energy in the loop and found that the threshold effect does not affect the spectrum shape .",
    "in addition , since the @xmath12 resonance is far from the @xmath15 threshold , this issue is irrelevant for the @xmath12 resonance .    in this paper , we apply this @xmath1-induced production off deuteron target also to the @xmath12 resonance , which has @xmath24 and @xmath25 and is also located below the @xmath15 threshold .",
    "the @xmath12 is understood well in quark model point of view ; it is classified in flavor decuplet .",
    "nevertheless , there are few theoretical discussion on @xmath12 formation in the @xmath15 channel . in addition",
    ", for precise determination of the @xmath11 properties from experiments , it is very important to understand contributions of @xmath12 in the @xmath11 production process , because the @xmath11 and @xmath12 resonances are located at very similar energy having tens mev widths and their spectra overlap each other .",
    "this reaction gives also important informations on the subthreshold productions of @xmath11 and @xmath12 , which will be significant in the strange few - body bound systems of @xmath26 @xcite , @xmath27 @xcite and @xmath28 @xcite .",

    "we also note that the @xmath55 spectrum does not show the @xmath12 contribution , because the @xmath55 channel does not contain @xmath25 component .",

    "[ fig:2 ] ) has the largest contribution .",
    "the reason that diagram 1 corresponding to the impulse production of the hyperon resonances gives small contribution is that deuteron hardly has the high momentum component of the inside nucleons as discussed in ref .",
    "namely , in order to produce the hyperon resonances below the @xmath51 threshold , one needs to create an energetic nucleon in the final state of the @xmath113 reaction .",
    "such an energetic nucleon is , however , scarcely produced in the impulse process of the @xmath50 reaction , because large fermi momentum of the nucleon is highly suppressed by the deuteron wave function due to the small binding energy . as a consequence ,",
    "the impulse production of the hyperon resonances has quite small contribution .",
    "compared with the impulse process , the double scattering process ( diagram 2 and 3 ) is kinematically favored .",
    "namely in the double scattering process the transferred energy can be taken from the incident kaon so that the exchanged kaon has less energy than on - shell , which is favorable for the production of hyperon resonances below the @xmath51 threshold . among the double scattering ,",
    "since the @xmath153 amplitude takes larger value than that of the @xmath154 amplitude in the considering energy region , the diagram 2 has the largest contribution to both the @xmath11 and @xmath12 production ( see also discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "now let us see the angular dependence of the production of the hyperon resonances .",
    "first of all , we show the double differential cross section @xmath155 in the @xmath137 reaction in fig .",
    "[ fig : angle ] , in which the incident kaon momentum is fixed to be 800 mev / c . in this reaction",
    "we can see the two peaks coming from two resonances , @xmath12 around 1385 mev and @xmath11 around 1420 mev , for @xmath156 .",
    "angular dependence of @xmath53 invariant - mass spectrum at 800 mev / c incident @xmath109 momentum .",
    "the values of @xmath157 in the figure is in unit of degrees .",
    ", width=529 ]    as one can see , the @xmath11 peak has strong angular @xmath158 dependence .",
    "the @xmath11 peak takes its largest value at @xmath159 ( deg . ) , which corresponds the forward neutron emission in the total center - of - mass frame , and it becomes about 10 times smaller in the region @xmath160 ( deg . ) .",
    "the reason is as follows .",
    "the momentum transfer by the exchanged kaon becomes smaller in the double scattering process in the region @xmath161 ( deg . ) , because in this case the incident kaon kicks out neutron in the direction of incident kaon and gives most of its momentum simply to the neutron in the first step of the double scattering .",
    "this small momentum transfer makes the exchanged kaon close to be on the mass shell , in which the double scattering amplitude takes larger value .",
    "hence , due to the kinematical reasons of the dominant double scattering ( discussed in the previous section ) and of the suitable momentum transfer , the @xmath11 peak has a large angular dependence and consequently backward @xmath11 production is dominated .",
    "the @xmath12 peak , on the other hand , shows only small angular dependence in the @xmath137 reaction .",
    "this is caused by the @xmath4-wave nature of @xmath12 in the meson - baryon scattering .",
    "namely , since the @xmath4-wave amplitude depends linearly on the transferred momentum , the @xmath12 can not be much produced with the neutron forward angle , in which the momentum transfer becomes smaller ( as discussed above ) .",
    "this momentum transfer becomes larger as the angle @xmath158 becomes larger , since the incident kaon has to kick out neutron in the opposite direction of the kaon momentum in the first step of the double scattering .",
    "therefore , as a combination of @xmath4-wave nature of @xmath12 and suitable region of the momentum transfer in the process , @xmath12 production shows small angular dependence although in the middle @xmath158 region the production is not favored by the kinematics .",
    "the angular dependence of the hyperon resonance production is clearly seen in the differential cross section @xmath162 with the integration range ( @xmath163 ) given in sec .",
    "[ sec:3a ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig : angle2 ] , we plot the @xmath162 for the @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) production in the @xmath164 ( @xmath165 ) reaction . from fig .",
    "[ fig : angle2 ] , we can see that the @xmath11 is produced dominantly in the forward neutron angle , whereas the @xmath12 production moderately depends on the neutron angle .",
    "angular dependence of the @xmath11 and @xmath138 production cross sections in @xmath166 ( for @xmath11 ) and @xmath167 ( for @xmath138 ) reactions .",
    ", width=302 ]      as we have seen in the previous sections , the @xmath11 peak appears at 1420 mev instead of nominal 1405 mev in the @xmath58 invariant mass of the @xmath168 reaction thanks to the selective @xmath11 production by the @xmath15 channel .",
    "this fact implies that there is a possibility that the @xmath12 and @xmath11 peaks are seen separately in the @xmath58 mass spectrum of the @xmath50 reaction , which are usually mixed with each other due to the similar peak energies . here in order to investigate the behavior of the peak structures , we plot the missing mass spectrum of the reaction @xmath169 . in the energy region around 1400 mev , the missing mass spectrum is expected to be dominated by the @xmath170 system .",
    "hence , evaluating from the relevant diagrams shown in figs .",
    "[ fig:2 ] and [ fig:2.5 ] and neglecting the amplitudes in which @xmath38 and @xmath49 do not correlate to each other , which will make no structure in the missing mass spectrum , we can plot the missing mass spectrum in fig .",
    "[ fig : missingmass ] .     missing mass spectrum in @xmath169 process at 800 mev@xmath21 incident @xmath109 momentum .",
    "the solid , dashed , dashed - dotted , and dashed - double dotted lines are total , @xmath171 , @xmath172 , @xmath173 , and @xmath174 contributions to @xmath175 . , width=302 ]    as one can see , there appears the double - peak structure coming from @xmath12 ( around 1385 mev ) and @xmath11 ( around 1420 mev ) . in the missing mass spectrum ,",
    "the @xmath12 peak comes from @xmath52 and the @xmath11 peak from @xmath152 channel .",
    "the reason why we can separate the @xmath12 peak and the @xmath11 one is , as discussed above , we can produce @xmath11 from @xmath51 initial channel , pinning down the production process via conservation of the strangeness .",
    "we have done the study of the @xmath12 and @xmath11 productions induced by @xmath109 on a deuteron target by calculating the @xmath176 reaction . we have taken into account both @xmath5- and @xmath4-wave contributions of the meson - baryon scatterings in the @xmath50 reaction , especially the contribution of the @xmath12 resonance is newly considered in this study . in the @xmath176 reaction ,",
    "the hyperon resonances are created selectively by the @xmath15 channel .",
    "thanks to this fact , the higher pole state of @xmath11 is produced and the @xmath58 spectrum has a peak at around 1420 mev .",
    "this finding implies that the @xmath11 and @xmath12 could be seen separately in the missing mass spectrum of the emitted nucleon in the @xmath177 reaction .",
    "we have found that invariant mass spectrum of @xmath8 is consistent with experimental data  @xcite , both for @xmath12 and @xmath11 cases .",
    "we have investigated the angular dependence of the hyperon resonances and found that the @xmath11 production mainly takes place in the backward direction , while the @xmath12 production does not strongly depend on the angle of the emitted nucleon .",
    "we studied the production mechanisms of @xmath12 and @xmath11 from the theoretical side .",
    "we have also estimated the pion exchange contributions coming from diagrams in which @xmath38 and @xmath49 is not correlated to each other and found that these contributions give smooth background and do not spoil the peak structure of the hyperon resonances .",
