    "note that the three neighboring hexagons lying in a triangular structure can not be ` perfect ' at the same time for any kind of dimer coverings .",
    "interestingly , this vbs-36 phase is adiabatically connected to the 36-site - unit - cell vbs ground state of the ideal kagome lattice @xcite in the sense that as we increase the magnitude of @xmath64 from zero to one , the vbs-36 phase evolves smoothly to the 36-site - unit - cell vbs ground state of the ideal kagome lattice .    in the case of the @xmath22-depleted lattice , the vbs ground state is already uniquely determined by the second order perturbation theory",
    "that is , the vbs-12 phase is the ground state and the vbs-36 phase is a closely competing phase .",

    ", all the dimer coverings are degenerate up to the second order in @xmath54 and the degeneracy can only be lifted by the third order perturbation processes as emphasized in ref .. this is because the numbers of the filled and empty triangles on the ideal kagome lattice are fixed for any dimer covering due to the spatial geometry of the ideal kagome lattice ( see ref . ) .",
    "this is , in fact , the reason why the 36-site - unit - cell vbs is the most stable vbs state on the ideal kagome lattice .",

    "we investigate the effect of finite @xmath17 on the ground state properties of the deformed kagome lattice .",

    "the ground state energy per site of an infinite lattice can be written as a sum over cluster terms of the form , @xmath69 . here",

    "@xmath74 is the ground state energy of the cluster @xmath71 and the sum is over all subclusters @xmath75 of @xmath71 . since the reduced energy @xmath72 is equal to the sum of the contributions from all connected diagrams ( _ i.e. _  the patterns of connected dimers ) that span the cluster @xmath71 , such diagrams only contribute beyond a certain minimum order in @xmath54 , proportional to the size of the cluster",
    "thus , to obtain a perturbation series that is exact up to a given order , it is sufficient to sum up the reduced energies of all the clusters up to the corresponding size .",
    "this gives us a systematic procedure for carrying out the expansion to higher orders.@xcite    another appealing aspect of applying the linked cluster expansion method is that we can considerably reduce the complexity of the calculation by using the freedom in choosing clusters .",

    "one can still see the gap between the lower four bands and the upper two bands .",
    "however , when @xmath17 becomes vanishingly small , the gap structure disappears due to wide bandwidth of the triplet bands .",
    "-depleted kagome lattice . here",
    "the dotted ( red ) square represents the smallest flippable loop .",
    ", width=8 ]    in the case of the vbs phases with a big unit cell , a large number of degenerate dimer configurations may allow many singlet excitations below a spin gap .",
    "for example , the vbs-36 order on the ideal kagome lattice leads to the large degeneracy that comes from the combination of the broken translational symmetry and the local resonance moves around flippable loops ( see ref . and ref . ) . here",
    "the flippable loops mean a collection of alternating occupied and unoccupied links ; when the roles of the occupied and unoccupied links on a flippable loop are interchanged , one hardcore dimer covering can be continuously transformed to another one .",
    "the perfect hexagons and the pinwheel dimers form the smallest flippable loops in the case of the 36-site vbs phase on the ideal kagome lattice.@xcite the number of singlet excitations arising from such considerations is still smaller than what was observed in the exact diagonalization studies @xcite of small system sizes ( up to 36 sites ) for the spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic heisenberg model on the ideal kagome lattice .",
    "it was , however , argued that the triplets can scatter to form additional singlet bound states in finite size systems and this may explain the exact diagonalization results @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the vbs-12 phase on the @xmath17-depleted kagome lattice does not break any translational symmetry and the local resonances from loop flips are the only sources of low energy singlet excitations . in fig.[fig : loopflip ] , we show the smallest flippable loop consisting of the four occupied and four unoccupied links , and its loop flip in the vbs-12 phase .",
    "note that there is a change in the number of the _ empty _ and _ filled _ triangles after the loop flips .",
    "in fact , a single loop flip increases the number of the _ filled _ triangles by two . according to eq.([eq : e - secondorder ] ) and eq.([eq : e - thirdorder ] ) in the perturbation theory , this requires the energy cost of @xmath136 , which is much larger than the measured spin gap @xmath137 if the experimentally estimated @xmath138 is used .",
    "since the number of the _ filled _ triangles involved in a loop flip is proportional to the size of the flippable loop , the singlet excitations coming from a larger loop flip require even higher energy cost .",
    "therefore , the vbs-12 phase is quite stable against local singlet fluctuations and it seems difficult to produce  the singlet wave \" whose existence is speculated in a recent experimental paper .",
    "@xcite we expect the lowest singlet excitation would be well above the spin gap , which can be contrasted with many singlet excitations below a spin gap in the case of the ideal kagome lattice . in summary , slight lattice distortions can completely change the nature of the ground state of the quantum antiferromagnet on the kagome lattice and this leads to the abrupt modification of the elementary excitation spectra in both the triplet and singlet channels . even though @xmath26 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 are not exactly the same in rb@xmath0cu@xmath1snf@xmath2 , the magnitudes of these exchange couplings are very similar and satisfy @xmath139 .",
    "interestingly , the vbs-12 phase studied in this work corresponds to the dimer covering that resides only on the @xmath26 links .",
    "this suggests that the vbs-12 phase on the @xmath26 links is stable all the way to the limit where @xmath28 and @xmath29 become the same as @xmath26 .",
    "thus , we expect that our results are directly applicable to rb@xmath0cu@xmath1snf@xmath2 .",
    "in particular , our predictions on the triplet and singlet spectra can be tested in the future neutron scattering and specific heat experiments on rb@xmath0cu@xmath1snf@xmath2 .",

    "<S> motivated by a recent experiment on rb@xmath0cu@xmath1snf@xmath2 , where spin-1/2 cu@xmath3 moments reside on the layers of kagome - like lattices , we investigate quantum ground states of the antiferromagnetic heisenberg model on a series of deformed kagome lattices . </S>",
    "<S> the deformation is characterized by a weaker exchange coupling @xmath4 on certain lattice links appropriate for rb@xmath0cu@xmath1snf@xmath2 with @xmath5 corresponding to the ideal kagome lattice . in particular , we study possible valence bond solid phases using the perturbation theory around isolated dimer limits , dimer series expansion , and self - consistent bond operator mean field theory . it is shown that the valence bond solid phase with a 36-site unit cell of the ideal kagome lattice is quite sensitive to a small lattice distortion as the kind discovered in rb@xmath0cu@xmath1snf@xmath2 . as a result , we find that a more likely quantum ground state in rb@xmath0cu@xmath1snf@xmath2 is the valence bond solid phase with a 12-site unit cell , where six dimers form a pinwheel structure , leading to strong modification of the elementary triplet and singlet excitation spectra in the deformed kagome lattices . </S>"
