    "the cosmic dark ages , during which the only source of radiation was the adiabatically cooling cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , ended when the first stars formed ( see @xcite for an overview of this process ) .",
    "the exact nature of the first stars and galaxies is uncertain , but the radiation they emitted will have dramatically altered the state of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "neutral hydrogen ( hi ) dominates the composition of the igm until the epoch of reionization ( eor ) ; as such it is hoped that the impact of these galaxies will be detectable with the 21-cm line , a spectral line produced by a hyperfine transition in hi @xcite .",
    "the spin temperature ( @xmath1 ) , defines the distribution of the electron population over the singlet and triplet hyperfine levels involved in the 21-cm transition @xcite .",
    "if this is in equilibrium with the temperature of the cmb ( @xmath2 ) then the 21-cm signal will not be detectable .",
    "however , radiation from stars breaks this equilibrium , leading to an observable signal in absorption where @xmath3 , and in emission when @xmath4 .",
    "as well as affecting the spin temperature , radiation from the first stars began ionizing neutral hydrogen .",
    "most important to this discussion is the production of lyman-@xmath0 , x - ray and ultra - violet radiation .",
    "* wouthuysen - field ( lyman-@xmath0 ) coupling:*. the populations of the 21-cm hyperfine levels are mixed by repeated absorption and re - emission of lyman-@xmath0 radiation .",
    "photons contribute to the lyman-@xmath0 radiation field through cascades .",
    "] this couples the spin temperature to the lyman-@xmath0 colour temperature @xmath5 .",
    "repeated scattering of lyman-@xmath0 photons off atoms couples @xmath5 to the kinetic gas temperature ( @xmath6 ) and so @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "wf coupling therefore produces fluctuations in the 21-cm signal , the observation of which would provide insight into the nature of lyman-@xmath0 sources .",
    "* x - ray heating : * an abundance of x - rays are produced by accretion onto compact objects , such as black holes and neutron stars , as well as by hot gas in the interstellar medium .",
    "these x - rays induce photo - ionizations resulting in primary and secondary electrons .",
    "it is unlikely that x - ray photo - ionizations are efficient enough to be solely responsible for the reionization of the universe @xcite ; however , once the igm has been ionized to a few percent , the photo - ejected electrons deposit the majority ( @xmath8% ) of their energy as heat in the igm @xcite . because the wouthuysen - field ( wf ) coupling described in ( i )",
    "is likely to have started at an early stage , the onset of x - ray production will raise the 21-cm spin temperature .",
    "observation of 21-cm fluctuations produced by the heating process will therefore provide insight into the nature of x - ray sources .",
    "* reionization : * as the universe evolves , ultra - violet ( uv ) radiation from a growing number of galaxies begins to ionize the igm .",
    "these ionizing photons have a short mean - free path and so carve out well defined ionized regions around galaxies in an otherwise mostly neutral igm .",
    "these grow with time until they eventually merge and the universe is reionized .",
    "the associated depletion of neutral gas ( and thus 21-cm signal ) produces 21-cm fluctuations whose observation will provide insight into the process of reionization ( i.e. the nature of the sources responsible , and of the igm ) whilst sub - dominant to uv ionizations , x - ray induced ionizations will also impact on the ionization state of the igm ( for example , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the exact timing of processes ( i)-(iii ) , and the degree to which they overlap , are uncertain , especially for the coupling and heating processes .",
    "this uncertainty depends on the nature of the stars that drive wf coupling and the efficiency ( and relative timing ) of x - ray production @xcite .",
    "if the x - ray efficiency is low enough , 21-cm fluctuations induced by x - ray heating may well persist into the eor .    despite such uncertainties",
    ", it is expected that processes ( i ) - ( iii ) occurred in the order described . as the main source of x - rays is thought to be accretion onto compact objects , the production of x - rays is likely to be delayed by a few million years relative to the first stars igniting .",
    "lyman-@xmath0 production is coincident with formation of the first stars , and the emissivity to achieve lyman-@xmath0 coupling is much lower than that required of x - rays to substantially heat the igm",
    ". therefore lyman-@xmath0 coupling will at least commence prior to the onset of x - ray heating @xcite . because the mean free path of uv photons",
    "is very small , uv - driven reionization will inevitably be delayed relative to wf coupling and x - ray heating .",
    "the only constraints we have on the nature of high - redshift x - ray production come from lower - redshift observations .",
    "the dominant x - ray sources observed are active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) .",
    "x - ray emission from the hot interstellar medium ( ism ) is also found to contribute significantly to the soft x - ray emission of nearby galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "observations of the unresolved cosmic x - ray background point towards agn being the dominant contributor in the local universe @xcite .",
    "however , the agn number density rapidly decreases at @xmath9 ( see @xcite and references therein ) , although some scope remains in the faint end of the luminosity function for low - mass ` mini - quasars ' to contribute at higher redshifts ( for example , @xcite ) .",
    "hmxbs are expected to be dominant at high redshift because : ( 1 ) in the absence of an agn they dominate x - ray output in low - redshift galaxies @xcite , and ( 2 ) their abundance is proportional to star - formation rate and ` starburst ' galaxies are seen to increase with redshift ( for example , @xcite ) .",
    "theoretical modelling also suggests that a high fraction of the first stars formed in binaries or multiple systems would evolve into hmxbs @xcite .",
    "the x - ray spectral energy distribution ( sed ) and the associated mean free path of x - rays determine the scale of 21-cm fluctuations produced by inhomogeneous heating .",
    "the sed can be fit with a power law where the specific luminosity @xmath10 is proportional to the frequency @xmath11 as @xmath12 with spectral energy index .",
    "] of @xmath0 .",
    "a harder x - ray sed , with @xmath13 , produces higher energy x - rays , which have a longer mean free path .",
    "shocks in supernovae and agn have an energy index @xmath14 @xcite , the hot ism produces an sed described by @xmath15 @xcite , and hmxbs have a hard spectra described by @xmath16 - @xmath17 @xcite . even if we knew the appropriate spectral energy index to describe the sed at high redshift , there is the matter of the luminosity s normalisation . we can normalise the luminosity at high redshifts to match the low redshift observations , however it could be orders of magnitudes apart from what we observe today .",
    "given that the x - ray properties of high redshift sources are so uncertain there is much to be gained from observing these epochs .",
    "the first generation of 21-cm radio telescope such as lofar , mwa and paper aim to constrain reionization statistically and are already starting to set interesting upper limits ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "however , next - generation instruments hera and ska will not only dramatically improve constraints on reionization , but also aim to probe the pre - reionization era .",
    "telescopes seeking to measure the global average of the 21-cm signal , such as edges and dare , should also provide valuable ( and complementary ) constraints on the eor and pre - reionization epochs @xcite .    observing the 21-cm line will clearly be rewarding , however it will be challenging as the signal is small ( @xmath18 mk ) and foregrounds will be orders of magnitude larger @xcite .",
    "it is hoped that by exploiting the spectral smoothness of foregrounds they may be removed ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "alternatively , we could avoid foregrounds by exploiting the existence of a wedge feature in the @xmath19-@xmath20 cylindrically - binned 2d power spectrum to which foregrounds are confined ( e.g. @xcite ) . )",
    "combined with the chromatic nature of a radio telescope ( i.e. at different frequencies the instrument probes different scales ) which smear foregrounds into larger @xmath20 . ]",
    "it is not yet clear how well foregrounds can be mitigated ( see @xcite ) , so it is vital that we have a strong understanding of the statistics of 21-cm fluctuations , even in light of next - generation instruments .",
    "there are also a large number of astrophysical parameters ( many of which are degenerate with each other , see for example @xcite and @xcite ) for which we have no constraints on in the high - redshift universe .",
    "therefore we must also fully investigate all possibilities for the range of physics we might observe .",
    "much attention has been focussed on measuring the 21-cm power spectrum , which has been shown to be rich with information ( for example , @xcite ) . however , given the challenging nature of these observations it is also worth considering one - point statistics .",
    "one - point statistics have been shown to be information rich , are simpler to interpret , and will be differently affected by foregrounds ( e.g. @xcite ) .    the sensitivity of the 21-cm one - point statistics to coupling and heating has not yet been studied in detail . in this paper",
    "we investigate the sensitivity of these statistics to the x - ray efficiency and spectral index using semi - numerical simulations . in doing so",
    ", we lift the assumption that @xmath21 ( which is often made when simulating reionization ) to study the impact of different x - ray properties on the 21-cm moments during the eor .",
    "we note that during the writing of this paper a similar work by @xcite was submitted to mnras .",
    "our work differs in that our simulated boxes are bigger ( theirs are 200mpc , ours are 600mpc ) .",
    "this is of particular importance in studying x - rays because of their long mean free path , which can be up to hundreds of mpc ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we also include peculiar velocities in our simulations .",
    "our paper includes several additional elements :    we present detailed analysis of the impact of x - ray processes on reionization .",
    "in particular , we show that the evolution of the skewness is altered in the case of late x - ray heating , providing a useful feature for constraining such models .",
    "the impact of different values for the spectral index is studied , identifying a degeneracy between x - ray efficiency and spectral index ( because both alter the amplitude of the 21-cm variance ) .",
    "this degeneracy may be broken through observations of the 21-cm skewness .",
    "this provides sensitivity to the x - ray spectral hardness .",
    "finally we consider the prospects for constraining x - ray source properties with current and future generations of radio telescope .",
    "in particular , we establish that even if foreground removal is not possible , the 21-cm variance can be accurately measured using foreground avoidance techniques .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section [ sec : sims ] we describe our simulations ; in section [ sec : coup_heat ] we study the evolution of the variance and skewness during the epochs of wf coupling and x - ray heating ; we then look at the impact of x - ray processes on the moments during reionization in section [ sec : eor ] ; in section [ sec : obs ] we consider the observational prospects for constraining the nature of wf coupling , x - ray heating , and reionization using the moments ; finally in sections [ sec : disc ] and [ sec : conc ] we discuss caveats of our work and conclude .",

    "there are several approximations made in 21cmfast that may have important repercussions ; in particular the code assumes average properties of the igm in calculating the x - ray mean free path .",
    "this is most important during the later stages of reionization when large ionized regions will result in fluctuations of the x - ray mean free path between sight - lines in the box .",

    "recent simulations indicate that these first stars will be @xmath211 and are expected to form in small clusters ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "formation of such population iii stars rely primarily on cooling via molecular hydrogen , however they produce large amounts of lyman - werner radiation ( which disassociate molecular hydrogen ) and so are likely to stunt further formation of population iii stars ( e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "there are other processes that must be considered in parallel to spin temperature fluctuations .",
    "for example , and as already discussed , the presence of sinks could drastically reduce the variance .",
    "this reduction is due to residual signal in ionized regions and sub - pixel ionized regions .",
    "x - ray ionizations will occur in a more homogeneous fashion than uv ionizations and so will be responsible for partially ionizing regions outside of uv carved ionized regions .",
    "it therefore seems likely that the reduction of variance caused by x - ray ionizations will be in addition to that caused by sinks , i.e. they will further reduce the contrast between over and under - dense regions .",
    "the simulation of @xcite also incorporate uvb feedback which suppresses star formation , such feedback will clearly impact on both the lyman-@xmath0 and x - ray production .",
    "however , given the large amplitudes seen in the one - point statistics during the heating epoch , and that we have studied four orders of magnitude in the x - ray efficiency , it is unlikely that uvb feedback will have a dramatic effect beyond that seen here .",
    "these examples ( and the lack of numerical simulations with which to test 21cmfast ) serve to illustrate the challenge we face in simulating the epochs of the first dawn and reionization .",
    "the results of this work should therefore not be considered conclusive and it is essential that we do more to understand how the statistics of the 21-cm moments are impacted by different physical processes ( and their interplay ) .",
    "in this paper , we have considered the sensitivity of one - point statistics of the 21-cm brightness temperature to fluctuations in wf coupling and x - ray heating , concentrating on the skewness and the variance .",
    "we use semi - numerical simulations to vary the efficiency at which x - rays are produced ( to cover four orders of magnitude ) and the spectral index of the x - ray sed ( to encompass the range of observational constraints we have at low redshifts ) . from this study",

    "the amplitude of this maximum in the variance is also sensitive to the hardness of the x - ray sed .",
    "this degeneracy may be broken , as the skewness is only sensitive to the x - ray production efficiency ;    late x - ray heating causes the drop from the x - ray heating peak to occur at an ionized fraction of about a quarter rather than in the very early stages of reionization .",
    "in such a model , the turnover in the variance , usually associated with the mid - point of reionization , is shifted to higher ionized fractions .",
    "the evolution of the skewness is qualitatively different if x - ray heating occurs late , this provides a clean way to constrain such a model .",
    "the amplitude of the variance is greatly reduced in these models , which would make it more challenging for the first - generation instruments ( such as lofar , mwa and paper ) to make a detection of reionization using the variance ;    the high - redshift heating peak must be allowed for in models used for parameter estimation from one - point statistics .",
    "if not our inferences may be very misleading .",
    "this is equally true for performing parameter estimation from the power spectrum ;    x - ray ionizations reduce the amplitude of the variance . in most models",

    "the findings of this paper will help us to correctly interpret future observations of the 21-cm brightness temperature ; in particular they have important consequences for improving parameter estimation during reionization .",
