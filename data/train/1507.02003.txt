    "additional couplings such as the @xmath16 hopping term breaks the orbital degeneracy while a zeeman or a bias term break the spin and the valley degeneracy respectively . the degeneracy can also be spontaneously broken by the coulomb interaction leading to different types of quantum hall ferromagnetic states . at the hartree - fock level",

    "as we will show , a spontaneous uniform orbital qhf does not lead to absorption at finite frequency since its pseudospin - wave mode is gapless .",
    "the other phases , however , have modes that can be excited with right or left circularly polarized light .",
    "it should thus be possible to distinguish the phases by the optical absorption due to their collective modes . in fig . 1 , pairs of states ( or `` conjugate states '' ) on each side of @xmath27 share the same dispersion of their collective modes as well as other physical properties such as the transport gap .",
    "they absorb electromagnetic radiation at the same frequency although with different intensities and from opposite circular polarizations of an incident electromagnetic wave .",
    "the kerr rotation also show noticeably different behaviors for conjugate biases : the polarization rotates in opposite directions and the amplitude of the rotation is much larger for bias @xmath30 .",

    "<S> in a quantizing magnetic field , the chiral two - dimensional electron gas in landau level @xmath0 of bilayer graphene goes through a series of phase transitions at integer filling factors @xmath1 $ ] when the strength of an electric field applied perpendicularly to the layers is increased . at filling factor @xmath2 the electron gas can described by a simple two - level system where layer and spin degrees of freedom are frozen . </S>",
    "<S> the gas then behaves as an orbital quantum hall ferromagnet . </S>",
    "<S> a coulomb - induced dzyaloshinskii - moriya term in the orbital pseudospin hamiltonian is responsible for a series of transitions first to a wigner crystal state and then to a spiral state as the electric field is increased . </S>",
    "<S> both states have a non trivial orbital pseudospin texture . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we study how the phase diagram at @xmath3 is modified by an electric field applied in the plane of the layers and then derive several experimental signatures of the uniform and nonuniform states in the phase diagram . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the transport gap , we study the electromagnetic absorption and the kerr rotation due to the excitations of the orbital pseudospin - wave modes in the broken - symmetry states . </S>"
