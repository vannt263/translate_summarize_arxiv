    "it is well known that a turbulent plasma is a source of electromagnetic emission at the fundamental plasma frequency @xmath1 and its second harmonic .",
    "these emission mechanisms have been found to play an important role in different space phenomena such as type iii solar radio bursts @xcite and radiations of planet s magnetospheres @xcite .",
    "plasma emissions at @xmath1 and @xmath2 have been also observed in laboratory beam - plasma experiments @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the problem of type iii radio bursts , in which the density of wave energy @xmath3 is saturated at weakly turbulent levels @xmath4 ( @xmath5 is the plasma density , @xmath6 is the temperature of plasma electrons ) , we focus our attention on the regime of strong plasma turbulence @xmath7 , which is more appropriate for laboratory experiments with powerful electron beams @xcite",
    ".    beam - plasma experiments at mirror traps @xcite have demonstrated that the relativistic electron beam with the typical energy 1 mev and current density 1 @xmath8 injected into the plasma with @xmath9 loses about 30% of its energy over the length of 1 m. it means that the averaged power density pumping by the beam to the plasma turbulence can be estimated as @xmath10 .",
    "the rate of beam energy losses , however , is not uniform over this length .",
    "the estimate for the peak pumping power can be derived assuming that a significant part of beam energy goes to excitation of the large amplitude coherent wave - packet at the entrance to the plasma column .",
    "since the beam is decelerated over the packet length @xmath11 by @xmath12 @xcite , where @xmath13 is the growth - rate of the two - stream instability and @xmath14 is the beam velocity , the maximum power of beam energy losses reaches the value @xmath15 .",
    "thus , if only 1% of pumping power is able to convert to electromagnetic radiation , the maximum power density of plasma emission produced in beam - plasma experiments at mirror traps can reach the range of 1 @xmath0 .",
    "the same level of conversion has been observed recently in laboratory experiments @xcite with the low plasma density @xmath16 , that is why it allows us to suppose that , in a denser plasma , a beam excited turbulence can be also considered as an efficient source of powerful electromagnetic radiation .",
    "the aim of this paper is to calculate the conversion efficiency as well as absolute values of emission power for the case when second harmonic plasma emission falls in the terahertz frequency range .",
    "our calculations of the spectral power of electromagnetic emission produced in a turbulent magnetized plasma are based on the theoretical model @xcite , in which it is assumed that electromagnetic waves are generated predominantly in the source region of strong plasma turbulence due to coalescence of upper - hybrid waves . since",
    "theoretical predictions have been found to agree with recent experimental results @xcite obtained at the gol-3 multimirror trap in the low density regime , we can use this model to study spectral and angular characteristics of electromagnetic emission for the whole ranges of plasma density and turbulence energy , which can be achieved in our beam - plasma experiments .",
    "thus , in section 2 , we formulate the main ideas of theoretical model that takes into account not only spontaneous generation of electromagnetic waves in coalescence processes , but also contributions of induced inverse processes . in section 3 ,",
    "we present calculations of second harmonic emission power in the terahertz frequency range and study whether this emission can escape from the plasma .",
    "our main results are summarized in concluding section 4 .",
    "to calculate the emission power from turbulent magnetized plasma we use the model of strong plasma turbulence proposed in @xcite . according to this model",
    ", we assume that most of wave energy is concentrated in upper - hybrid modes , which occupy the long - wavelength region of turbulent spectrum with wavenumbers @xmath17 ( @xmath18 is the debye length ) .",
    "the saturation level of this energy is determined by the balance between the constant power @xmath19 pumping to the turbulence by the beam and the power dissipated due to the wave collapse .",
    "it results in the following relation between the pumping power and the turbulence energy : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the ion mass and @xmath22 is the electron mass .",
    "we calculate the electromagnetic emission power @xmath23 and the conversion efficiency @xmath24 assuming that electromagnetic waves are generated due to coalescence of long - wavelength upper - hybrid waves .",
    "since in the source region of turbulent spectrum these waves are not trapped in collapsing caverns , nonlinear interaction between electromagnetic and upper - hybrid modes can be treated in the framework of weak turbulence . in this case ,",
    "generation of electromagnetic radiation is described by the equation @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the power of spontaneous emission produced in the coalescence process @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the nonlinear dissipation rate due to the decay @xmath29 . in dimensionless units",
    "@xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , for time , frequency , position and wavenumber , respectively , the spectral wave energy is normalized by the condition @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the speed of light . in the cold plasma limit ,",
    "dimensionless values of @xmath26 and @xmath28 take the forms @xmath36 @xmath37   d^3 k_1 d^3 k_2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we introduce the following notations : @xmath38 @xmath39 @xmath40 \\nonumber \\\\ + { \\bf k}_{2 } \\left({\\bf e}_{k_2}^{\\sigma^{\\prime\\prime } } \\widehat{t}_{k_1}^{\\sigma^{\\prime } } { \\bf e}_{k_1}^{\\sigma^{\\prime}}\\right)+(k_1 , \\sigma^{\\prime}\\rightleftarrows k_2 , \\sigma^{\\prime\\prime}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath41 here , eigenfrequencies @xmath42 and eigenvectors @xmath43 of linear plasma modes are determined by the standard dispersion equation with the dielectric tensor @xmath44 ( @xmath45 is the unit matrix ) .",
    "in contrast to the similar calculations of second harmonic emission @xcite based on the standard weak turbulence theory , we take into account model damping of two - time correlation functions , which is used to describe the effect of finite life - time of upper - hybrid plasmons due to their scattering off density fluctuations with the typical frequency @xmath46 .",
    "it results in correlation broadening of the resonance @xmath47 , which is described in ( [ eq3 ] ) by the function @xmath48 this function shows that the width of frequency spectrum of second harmonic electromagnetic emission depends essentially on nonlinear effects as well as on thermal and magnetic corrections to the linear dispersion of upper - hybrid modes . in order to minimize the frequency width of radiation",
    ", we should consider the case , when the ratio of the electron cyclotron frequency to the plasma frequency becomes low @xmath49 resulting in comparable contributions of magnetic and thermal effects for the typical plasma temperature @xmath50 kev in mirror traps . as to account for the effect of finite temperature , we modify the eigenfrequencies and eigenvectors of linear plasma modes , but we neglect modifications in the nonlinear current @xmath51 , which is much less sensitive to thermal corrections than @xmath52 .",
    "thus , to calculate @xmath42 , we use the fluid approximation and solve the linear dispersion relation with the dielectric tensor : @xmath53 where @xmath54 , magnetic field is directed along @xmath55-axis and @xmath56 is the wave vector with the length @xmath57 .",
    "if the path lengths of spontaneously generated electromagnetic waves are larger than the typical size of confined plasma @xmath58 ( @xmath59 is the group velocity of electromagnetic wave ) , decay processes @xmath60 do not play a role , and the second term in ( [ eq2 ] ) can be omitted .",
    "thus , in the case of azimuthally symmetric turbulence , the spectral emission power in units of @xmath61 is given by the integral @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the solution of @xmath64 and @xmath65 is the polar angle of @xmath66 .",
    "let us study the spectral and angular characteristics of second harmonic plasma emission for various regimes of beam - plasma interaction , which can be realized in mirror traps .",
    "we will vary the plasma density from @xmath67 to @xmath68 for different fixed values of turbulence energy @xmath69 , 0.05 , 0.1 and for the fixed parameters @xmath50 kev and @xmath70 .",
    "we assume here that the source region of turbulent spectrum contains the anisotropic population of resonant waves , which are directly pumped by the beam , and the isotropic population of nonresonant waves , which are the products of beam - driven waves scattering off density fluctuations .",
    "in our computations , the isotropic part occupies uniformly the spectral region @xmath71 , where the upper bound corresponds to the typical wavenumber of the modulation instability @xmath72 and the lower bound excludes modes with wavelengths larger than the typical plasma size . according to the model @xcite , the anisotropic population of beam - driven waves contains a small fraction of energy ( 10% ) and occupies the region : @xmath73 and @xmath74 .    in the regime with @xmath75 and @xmath76 ,",
    "computation results for the spectral density of emission power @xmath77 for extraordinary ( @xmath78 ) and ordinary ( @xmath79 ) electromagnetic modes are presented in figures [ r1](a ) and [ r1](b ) , respectively .",
    "it is seen that @xmath78-mode emission is dominated by the contribution of obliquely propagating waves with @xmath80 and @xmath81 , whereas the most intensive @xmath79-mode emission is concentrated near the transverse to the magnetic field direction .",
    "calculations of the path length @xmath82 for these emissions are shown in figures [ r1](c ) and [ r1](d ) .",
    "as one can see , the path length reaches the minimal value 20 - 40 cm for longitudinally propagating modes regardless of their polarization . for transverse propagation",
    ", this length increases up to 90 cm for the @xmath79-mode and exceeds 3 m for the @xmath78-mode .",
    "it means that emissions of both electromagnetic modes , generated in the plasma column with the diameter 56 cm typical to our beam - plasma experiments , are able to escape from the plasma and can be used for different applications .",
    "let us now find out how the frequency spectrum of electromagnetic emission , described by @xmath83 , depends on the plasma density .     in @xmath0 for different values of turbulence energy @xmath84 .",
    "]     ( a ) and @xmath85 ( b ) on the plasma density for different values of turbulence energy @xmath84 . ]    as a function of dimensionless frequency @xmath31 , the form of this spectrum is affected by the level of turbulence only . for the density @xmath75 and different values of turbulence energy , examples of frequency spectra , derived by summation over polarizations , are shown in figure [ r2 ] . in dimensional form , the linear frequency @xmath86 corresponding to the maximum of the spectral power @xmath83 and the width at half maximum @xmath85 for a fixed turbulence energy depend on the plasma density as follows : @xmath87 .",
    "figures [ r3](a ) and [ r3](b ) demonstrate that @xmath86 and especially @xmath85 grow with the increase of the turbulence level .",
    "it means that the spectral width of plasma emission in regimes of rather strong plasma turbulence is mainly determined by correlation broadening of resonances in nonlinear three - wave interactions .    to compute the integral power of second harmonic emission from the unit volume of turbulent plasma",
    ", we integrate the function @xmath83 over the frequency range @xmath88 and sum over polarizations",
    ". it is seen from figure [ r4 ] ,    . ]",
    "that this power increases like @xmath89 with the increase of plasma density for the fixed turbulence energy and reaches the value 1 @xmath0 in the regime with @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "it is interesting to note that these calculations adequately describes recent experimental results obtained in the strong magnetic field @xmath92 @xcite .",
    "indeed , the 1 @xmath93 range of emission power , observed experimentally in the regime with @xmath94 and @xmath95 , is also reproduced by calculations presented in figure [ r4 ] . from comparison with the results of @xcite",
    "we can conclude that the external magnetic field broadens the spectral width of electromagnetic emission , but does not change drastically the integral power . since the pumping power ( [ eq1 ] ) has the same dependence on plasma density as the emission power , the conversion efficiency @xmath96 in our model",
    "is completely determined by the turbulence energy . for @xmath76 ,",
    "this efficiency is estimated as @xmath97 .    to make clearer understanding how computation results are sensitive to the shape of turbulent spectrum",
    ", we calculate the spectral emission power for different spectra corresponding to the same turbulence energy ( figure [ r5 ] ) .",
    "when we replace the uniform isotropic spectrum of upper - hybrid modes used in previous calculations on more realistic falling spectra , changes in the integral emission power do not exceed 20% .",
    "-spectra ( a ) and the corresponding spectral power of electromagnetic emission ( b ) . ]    it should be emphasized that the high value of turbulence energy @xmath76 , which is required to generate 1 thz emission with the power density 1 @xmath0 , can be achieved in beam - plasma experiments at the gol-3 multimirror trap .",
    "indeed , for the typical beam energy 1 mev and current density 1.5 @xmath8 , the pumping power reaches the required level of 100 @xmath0 inside the region of most intensive beam - plasma interaction , where large amplitude coherent wave - packets are excited .",
    "since the length of this region is estimated as @xmath98 cm , the total power of terahertz emission in our laboratory experiments can reach 30100 mw .",
    "the spectral power of second harmonic electromagnetic emission , generated in the long - wavelength region of strong plasma turbulence due to coalescence of upper - hybrid waves , was calculated for different regimes of beam - plasma interaction , which can be realized in modern experiments at mirror traps .",
    "computation results have shown that beam energy transferred to plasma oscillations in the regime of strong plasma turbulence can be converted efficiently to electromagnetic radiation .",
    "we have studied spectral characteristics of plasma emission in wide ranges of plasma density and turbulence energy and shown that the power of terahertz radiation in our beam - plasma experiments can reach tens of mw .",
    "taking into account the angular distribution of this emission and possibility to change the emission frequency by varying the plasma density we come to the conclusion that terahertz radiation generated in a beam - driven strongly turbulent plasma can be very attractive for different applications .",
