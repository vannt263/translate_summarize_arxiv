    "the possibility to detect and control the motion of nanometer - sized - mechanical resonators by coupling them to mesoscopic electronic devices has generated a considerable research effort in recent years @xcite .",
    "in particular , the possibility to use such nanoelectromechanical systems ( nems ) as ultrasensitive sensors of , for example , displacement and mass , have been demonstrated in a number of works @xcite . independently of the specific type of electronic device considered in the different schemes ,",
    "a common feature that has emerged from these studies is that the electronic subsystem must be out of thermodynamic equilibrium in order to function as an ultrasensitive measurement tool in combination with the mechanical subsystem .",
    "this observation naturally raises the question of how the dynamics of the mechanical subsystem is affected by the _ nonequilibrium environment _ created by the mesoscopic electronic device to which it is coupled .",
    "it is known from statistical mechanics that the displacement and momentum fluctuations of a quantum harmonic oscillator ( the basic model for any movable structure that could be included in a nems ) , which is coupled to a thermal bath in equilibrium at temperature @xmath0 are described by gaussian distribution functions , whose widths are proportional to @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the frequency of the oscillator . from this formula",
    "it follows that the fluctuations have a thermodynamic origin in the high - temperature limit , where they are fully defined by the temperature of the thermal bath . on the other hand , at low temperatures @xmath3 the fluctuations",
    "are completely quantum mechanical in nature .",
    "what kind of changes from this picture could be expected if the oscillator is coupled to a _",
    "environment ? in spite of the difficulties related to the definition of temperature for systems that are out of thermodynamic equilibrium ,",
    "several theoretical works show that nonequilibrium fluctuations in the properties of nanomechanical oscillators coupled to mesoscopic electronic systems ( such as a single - electron transistor or a superconducting cooper pair box ) are , to a good approximation , still described by gaussian distribution functions @xcite .    a remarkable difference between a passive ( thermodynamic ) environment and an active ( nonequilibrium )",
    "one is that in the latter case the amplitude of the fluctuations can be controlled through parameters that characterize the state of the electronic subsystem .",
    "this external control introduced by the coupling between mechanical and electronic degrees of freedom opens the way for the possibility to reach the quantum limit of fluctuations even when the temperature is high on the scale defined by the quantum of mechanical energy , i.e. @xmath4 .    in the last few years considerable efforts have been made in order to , develop efficient procedures to effectively `` cool '' down the motion of nanomechanical resonators below the threshold defined by thermal fluctuations .",
    "most of the proposed schemes strive to reproduce the effects of laser cooling of atoms and molecules by purely electronic means @xcite .",
    "the general strategy underlying these approaches is based on the coherent control of resonant , energy - conserving transitions between _ discrete _ electronic levels .",
    "recently we have proposed a fundamentally new scheme to cooling the vibrations of a suspended - nanowire based mechanical oscillator @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the aforementioned cooling schemes , our proposal has the advantage that it does not rely on the energy conservation constraint .",
    "in particular , we considered a suspended carbon nanotube in tunnelling contact with the voltage - biased tip of a scanning tunnelling microscope ( stm ) and the metallic leads at which its ends are clamped .",
    "our analysis showed that the average number of quantized vibrational excitations , i.e. vibrons , ( which is proportional to the root - mean square fluctuations of the center - of - mass position ) can be reduced by varying the bias voltage within a range of values for which the probability for absorbing vibrons during inelastic electron tunnelling processes is significantly enhanced over the probability for vibron emission .    in this paper",
    "we demonstrate that the cooling mechanism suggested in ref .",
    "10 can work by exploiting the temperature gradient , rather than the potential drop across the system .",
    "we show that the amplitude of the root - mean square fluctuations of the nanotube center - of - mass position is smaller than what would be in presence of only an equilibrium thermal bath",
    ". this partial suppression of the stochastic fluctuations of the nanotube displacements can be interpreted as an effective cooling of the mechanical degrees of freedom of the system .",
    "moreover , we have found that this effective cooling phenomenon involves simultaneously several low - frequency vibrational modes and not only the fundamental one .",
    "to be specific , we consider the system sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : system ] , where a carbon nanotube is suspended over a trench between two metallic leads .",
    "its ends are both clamped , while a third electrode in the form of the tip a scanning tunnelling microscope ( stm ) is positioned above the nanotube .",
    "the suspended carbon nanotube can be considered as a quantum dot that is coupled to the surrounding electrodes through tunnel junctions .",
    "low - temperature tunnelling spectroscopy studies on freely hanging carbon nanotubes have shown that inelastic electron tunnelling can create a non - thermal equilibrium population of the vibronic states of the nanotube @xcite .     above the nanotube .",

    "the effect that the nanotube displacement has on the width of the tunnel barrier provides a mechanism of coupling the electronic and the mechanical degrees of freedom of the system . in the following",

    "the last term in the hamiltonian , @xmath37 , shown in eq .",
    "( [ def : h_c ] ) , describes the electrostatic interaction in the system .",
    "since both the stm tip and the substrate are grounded , an electron occupying the state inside nanotube induces a polarization charge of opposite sign in the stm tip and hence generates an electrostatic force @xmath38 acting on the nanotube .",
    "this force can be thought as applied to the point @xmath32 and directed towards stm tip ( this `` strongly localized '' form of the electrostatic force is a valid approximation if the effective radius of the stm tip is negligible with respect to the length of the nanotube ) .",
    "the electrostatic interaction described by the operator @xmath37 provides another mechanism that couples the dynamics of the mechanical and electronic degrees of freedom , which we will refer to hereafter as the _ polaronic _ electromechanical coupling , because of the formal analogy with the interaction term in hamiltonian of the polaron problem . under the assumptions of uniform charge distribution inside the charged nanotube ,",
    "if the equilibrium distance between the nanotube and the stm tip @xmath39 is much less than the effective radius of the tip , @xmath40 , then @xmath38 can be approximated by the following expression : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a numerical factor of the order of one and @xmath43 the vacuum permittivity . from the considerations presented above , it follows that the electronic and mechanical subsystems interact through two independent coupling mechanisms , that is the tunnelling and the polaronic .",

    "<S> we investigate theoretically the electromechanical properties of freely suspended nanowires that are in tunnelling contact with the tip of a scanning tunnelling microscope ( stm ) and two supporting metallic leads . </S>",
    "<S> the aim of our analysis is to characterize the fluctuations of the dynamical variables of the nanowire when a temperature drop is mantained between the stm tip and the leads , which are all assumed to be electrically grounded . by solving a quantum master equation that describes the coupled dynamics of electronic and mechanical degrees of freedom </S>",
    "<S> we find that the stationary state of the mechanical oscillator has a gaussian character , but that the amplitude of its root - mean square center - of - mass fluctuations is smaller than would be expected if the system were coupled only to the leads at thermal equilibrium . </S>"
