    "mass has been compared to the scidar turbulence profiler @xcite .",
    "the isoplanatic angle @xmath1 can be computed from the restored tp or estimated directly from the scintillation indices @xcite .",
    "temporal analysis of the light fluctuations in the smallest aperture a permits to estimate the time constant @xmath0 by the method of @xcite .",
    "this estimate is biased because it does not include the lowest 0.5 km of the atmosphere , but it can be corrected using the dimm data and known wind speed in the ground layer .      in a dimm ,",

    "the wave - front tilts are estimated from the centroids of two images in the focal plane of dimm . to reduce the noise , the centroids",

    "optical propagation has not been considered by the standard dimm theory .",
    "the propagation reduces the dimm response by two effects  partial conversion of phase distortions into scintillation and deviations from the weak - perturbation theory ( saturation ) .",
    "moreover , even small optical aberrations can significantly bias the dimm response to high - altitude turbulence .",
    "these effects are discussed in tk07 .    even in the absence of atmospheric image motion ,",

    "variations of the flux caused by scintillation or clouds can be accounted for as well .",
    "the differential variance of the wave - front tilts is estimated from the finite number of samples ( frames ) @xmath63 . the lower limit on the relative statistical error of the measured variance @xmath64 is @xmath65 , assuming that the samples are independent . to measure the seeing with a relative error of 2%",
    ", we need to measure the variance with an error of @xmath66 , hence @xmath67 . with typical 1min .",
    "accumulation time , a frame rate of 30hz or larger is required .",
    "in fact the statistical error of seeing measurements will be larger because frames are partially correlated and the seeing itself is non - stationary .",
    "a standard dimm instrument uses only two pieces of the telescope s aperture , while the remaining portion could serve for the mass channel .",
    "a study of the optimum aperture size @xcite has shown that an outer diameter of the 4 concentric mass apertures can be as small as 89 cm .",
    "such apertures fit into the annular un - obscured zone of a 2530 cm cassegrain telescope without vignetting .",
    "combination of mass and dimm in a single instrument has several obvious advantages .",
    "only one telescope is required , with its pointing and tracking controlled by centring the star in the dimm channel .",
    "both instruments work on the same optical path , thus sample the same turbulent volume , so that non - stationarity does not introduce any differential error .    the optical layout of the mass - dimm instrument is shown in fig .  [ fig : md ] .",

    "a weak positive lens ( fabry lens ) fl is placed in front of the telescope focus .",
    "it slightly shortens the effective telescope focal length and , at the same time , forms a real image of the pupil expp at a distance of 125  mm behind the focal plane .",
    "a circular aperture fp in the focal plane restricts the field to a typical diameter of 4@xmath68 in order to reduce unwanted flux from the sky and faint off - axis stars in the mass channel . to ease manual pointing , centring , and focusing ,",
    "there is a flip mirror vm in front of the focal aperture followed by an eyepiece .",
    "the size of the pupil image expp depends on the optical magnification factor @xmath69 of the telescope+lens system . for a 25-cm meade telescope and 125-mm fabry lens ,",
    "the magnification is @xmath70 , i.e. the pupil image has 17.4  mm diameter .",

    "assembly that actually splits the light between dimm and mass channels , described separately below . the pupil image on the plate",
    "can be centred either by moving the fl laterally or by tilting the whole mass - dimm instrument with respect to the telescope .",
    "we assume that the entrance pupil of the feeding telescope is located on the top end of the telescope tube , not on the primary mirror . in two - mirror telescopes ,",
    "the pupil image is formed behind the secondary mirror and lies near the focal plane of the primary mirror .",

    "the adaptation possibility becomes virtually un - limited if a single lens is replaced by a two - lens system .",
    "the two - lens module performs the same function as a single fl , i.e. it produces the real pupil image with the required scale @xmath69 and focuses the star onto the field aperture at the same time .",
    ".optical coupling of mass - dimm to some telescopes [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in addition to criteria on individual measurements , the sanity check on the data set as a whole is done by calculating average relative residuals between scintillation indices and their model ( the residuals are saved ) .",
    "average residual exceeding 5% on any of the indices is a strong indication of some problem such as wrong parameter settings , scattered light or vignetting .",
    "the vignetting is also monitored by the average flux ratio @xmath71 which increases when the aperture d is vignetted .",
    "the ratio depends slightly on the colours of the stars because individual pmts have slightly different spectral response .",

    "for example , we can study the long - term variation of the @xmath72-parameters and then apply their correct values to the old data .",

    "a set of tools for re - processing is provided together with the turbina program . individual statistical moments with 1-s integration",
    "are used in the re - processing and must be archived together with the main mass data files .",
    "starting from march 2006 , a new algorithm for correcting the effect of strong scintillation ( over - shoots ) is implemented in turbina .",

    "the spikes of seeing are perfectly correlated . when the ground - layer ( gl ) seeing is calculated as @xmath74 ( mass corrected for over - shoots , @xmath6 defined by eq .",

    "these conditions , encountered infrequently but regularly at all observatories where mass - dimm operates , resemble antarctic sites ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "if ground - layer turbulence were compensated by ao , an excellent image quality over wide field could be achieved on these calm nights .",
    "such special conditions can not be recognised only with a dimm because the total seeing on these calm nights is always dominated by the gl and not at all exceptional .",

    "mass is not sensitive to small pointing errors and can work even from a heated room through a window , as demonstrated by the first night - time seeing measurements in antarctica @xcite .",
    "the development of the mass - dimm instrument has been primarily driven by the need to characterise new and existing sites for the thirty meter telescope ( tmt ) project @xcite .",

    "the advantage of a mass - dimm is obvious , as it permits to differentiate atmospheric regions where seeing is degraded , whereas a simple dimm measures only integrated seeing .",

    "these openly available data are used in some studies @xcite .",
    "the statistical analysis of the mass - dimm data for cerro pachn shows a good agreement with previous data sets and leads to a new model of tp at this observatory @xcite .",
    "high photometric stability of the mass detectors permits to study the atmospheric transparency and its variations ( in the mass spectral band ) and to obtain photometric characterisation of a site .",
    "statistics of tp and @xmath0 delivered by mass - dimms gives useful input for predicting performance of current and future ao systems .",
    "@xcite compared the actual anisoplanatism in ao images with calculations based on simultaneous tps from mass - dimm and found that the latter provide a very good diagnostic .",
    "a large collection of tps at cerro pachn served to evaluate the gain from a ground - layer ao ( glao ) in statistical sense @xcite . a similar glao study for gemini @xcite",
    "is based on the tp model , while the glao study for the magellan telescope used real tps from mass - dimm @xcite .",
    "real - time monitoring of tp with mass - dimm opens a new exciting possibility to schedule critical ao observations flexibly , taking advantage of the best available conditions .",
    "these conditions are comparable to the calm atmosphere over antarctic plateau , but are encountered at existing observatories with 10-m class telescopes and an overall seeing better than in antarctica .",
    "potential improvement of ao capabilities ( more uniform correction in a wider field , operation at visible wavelengths ) is too important to miss and gives a strong incentive for flexible ao scheduling .    to date",
    ", a total of 22 mass - dimm instruments have been fabricated and delivered to several observatories and programs .",
    "there are all reasons to believe that these instruments will make a significant contribution to our understanding of atmospheric turbulence and will extend the potential of new methods such as ao and interferometry .",
