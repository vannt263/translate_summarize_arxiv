    "photoproduction of the isoscalar eta meson with mass of approximately 550 mev offers the possibility of investigating the @xmath4- and @xmath5-interaction , as well as the basic production amplitude .",
    "recently it has been suggested by wilkin@xcite that the very large production cross sections found in the @xmath12 reaction near threshold could be due to an @xmath4 scattering length that is much larger than the value extracted from a coupled - channels analysis of the @xmath13 and @xmath14 data@xcite .",
    "based on the k - matrix formalism , wilkin was able to reproduce the strong threshold energy dependence of @xmath15 by assuming an @xmath4 scattering length with a real part more than twice as large as in previous analyses .",
    "should this conclusion turn out to be true , it would have dramatic implications for the @xmath0-nucleus interaction .",
    "most importantly , a larger value for the scattering length might indicate a larger probability for the presence of a `` bound '' @xmath0-state for lighter nuclei such as @xmath16he than had been expected .",
    "in fact , this seems to be required to explain the cusp - like structure seen for near - threshold production in the @xmath17 reaction for a missing mass close to the @xmath0-mass .",
    "this effect may also remove the discrepancy between experiment and theory for the reaction @xmath18@xcite .    over the last several years",
    "there has been renewed interest in the production of @xmath0mesons with protons , pions and electrons and their interaction with nucleons and nuclei .",
    "one of the first @xmath0nuclear experiments , performed at saturne in 1988@xcite , reported surprisingly large eta production rates near threshold in the reaction @xmath19 .",
    "these large cross sections permitted not only a more precise determination of the @xmath0mass@xcite but were also used to perform rare decay measurements of the eta@xcite .",
    "additional experiments involving pion induced eta production were performed at los alamos@xcite .",
    "again , the experimental cross sections at threshold region of the reaction @xmath16he(@xmath20)@xmath16h are above the theoretical calculations@xcite .",
    "the advent of high duty - cycle electron accelerators opens for the first time the opportunity to study the reactions @xmath21 and @xmath22 in greater detail .",
    "our present knowledge of the @xmath23 process is based solely on some old measurements around 20 years ago@xcite , along with very few more recent data from bates@xcite and tokyo@xcite . over the last two years",
    "eta photoproduction from the nucleon has been measured at mainz and at bonn with an accuracy of more than an order of magnitude better than in older experiments . at mainz , the taps collaboration has obtained high - quality data for angular distributions and total cross sections for photon energies between threshold and 790 mev both on the nucleon  @xcite and on nuclear targets @xmath10 , @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "that may be considered to be a qualitative breakthrough in the experimental field .",
    "similarly , data at the higher energies up to 1150 mev will be provided soon by the phoenics collaboration at elsa @xcite .    in this work we present a study of the _ quasifree _ eta photoproduction on nuclei @xmath7 ( where @xmath24 is some discrete nuclear state ) in the distorted wave impulse approximation ( dwia ) .",
    "the model allows for the study of the production process and the final - state interactions without being obscured by the details of nuclear transition densities , unlike the reaction of the type @xmath25 where nuclear transition densities play an important role .",
    "this is mainly due to the quasifree nature of the reaction : the momentum transfer to the residual nucleus can be made small .",
    "the key ingredients of the model are a ) the single particle wave functions and spectroscopic factors , b ) the elementary eta photoproduction amplitudes , and c ) the final state interactions .",
    "information on each ingredient can be taken directly from independent studies .",
    "previous studies of such quasifree reactions on the pion have proven to be successful  @xcite .",
    "other studies on eta photoproduction from nuclei can be found , for example , in refs .",

    "nucleon resonance excitation is the dominant reaction process in @xmath23 . in contrast to pions which will excite @xmath27 as well as @xmath28 resonances",
    ", the @xmath0 meson will only appear in the decay of @xmath8 resonances with @xmath29 .",
    "in the low - energy region this is dominantly the @xmath1 state that decays 45 - 55% into @xmath4 , the only nucleon resonance with such a strong branching ratio in the @xmath0 channel .",
    "this result is even more surprising as a nearby resonance of similar structure , the @xmath30 has a branching ratio of only 1.5% .",
    "the other resonances that play roles in the low energy region are the @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "most attempts to describe eta photoproduction on the nucleon@xcite have involved breit  wigner functions for the resonances and either phenomenology or an effective lagrangian approach to model the background .",
    "these models which contain a large number of free parameters were then adjusted to reproduce the few available data . in a very different approach , ref .",
    "@xcite derived a dynamical model which employs @xmath31 and @xmath32 to fix the hadronic vertex as well as the propagators and the @xmath33 to construct the electromagnetic vertex .",
    "this calculation represents a prediction rather than a fit to the @xmath34 reaction .",
    "the model was later extended to include the background from @xmath35channel nucleon born terms and @xmath36 exchange in the @xmath37channel  @xcite . due to the fact that @xmath0 is an isoscalar meson , two coupling schemes are possible at the @xmath38 vertex : pseudovector(pv ) and pseudoscalar(ps ) .",
    "the latter one is not ruled out by let as in the case of @xmath39 .",
    "since the resonance sector is fixed in this approach and also the vector meson couplings can be obtained from independent sources , one can use this model to determine the nature of @xmath38 coupling : both the coupling scheme and the coupling constant .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath40-interaction , little is known about the @xmath41-interaction and , consequently , about the @xmath38 vertex .",
    "the uncertainty regarding the structure of the @xmath38 vertex extends to the magnitude of the coupling constant .",
    "this coupling constant @xmath42 varies between @xmath43 and @xmath44 with the large couplings arising from fits of one boson exchange potentials  @xcite .",
    "> from su(3 ) flavor symmetry , all coupling constants between the meson octet and the baryon octet are determined by one free parameter @xmath45 , giving @xmath46 resulting in values for the coupling constant between @xmath47 and @xmath48 for commonly used values of @xmath45 between @xmath49 , depending on the f and d strengths chosen as the two types of su(3 ) octet meson - baryon couplings .",
    "other determinations of the @xmath38 coupling employ reactions involving the eta , such as @xmath32 , and range from 0.6 - 1.7@xcite .",
    "smaller values are supported by @xmath50 forward dispersion relations@xcite with @xmath51 .",
    "there is some rather indirect evidence that also favors a small value for @xmath52 . in ref.@xcite , piekarewicz calculated the @xmath53@xmath0 mixing amplitude in the hadronic model where the mixing was generated by @xmath54 loops and thus driven by the proton  neutron mass difference . to be in agreement with results from chiral perturbation theory the @xmath55 coupling had to be constrained to the range 0.32  0.53 . in a very different approach ,",
    "hatsuda@xcite evaluated the proton matrix element of the flavor singlet axial current in the large @xmath56 chiral dynamics with an effective lagrangian that included the @xmath57(1 ) anomaly . in this framework ,",
    "the emc data on the polarized proton structure function ( which have been used to determine the `` strangeness content '' of the proton ) can be related to the @xmath58 and the @xmath55 coupling constants .",
    "again , his analysis prefers small values for both coupling constants .",
    "nevertheless , from the above discussion it seems clear that the @xmath38 coupling constant is much smaller than the corresponding @xmath59 value of around 14 .    in fig .",
    "[ freetot ] , we show the sensitivity of the total cross section close to threshold when varying the coupling constant from 0 to 3 for the ps and from 0 to 10 for the pv form . there is a large variation of more than a factor of 2 at 750 mev for the ps case while changing the value with pv structure modifies the cross section only by a relatively small amount .    here",
    "the very precise results of the new mainz experiment can clearly distinguish between the different models preferring a pseudoscalar coupling scheme with a best - fit coupling constant of @xmath42=0.4 .",
    "this is further supported by comparing with the differential cross section as shown in fig .",
    "[ freedif ] .",
    "there is a clear distinction in the forward - backward asymmetry of the angular distribution between the ps- and pv - model , and ps coupling with @xmath42=0.4 is strongly supported .",
    "the variation in the angular distributions is due to the @xmath60-wave multipoles . in particular",
    ", the @xmath61 multipole changes sign between ps and pv coupling .",
    "[ f3d ] shows the complete view of the differential cross section and the photon asymmetry of @xmath0 photoproduction on the proton from threshold up to 800 mev for ps coupling with @xmath42=0.4 .",
    "the resonance dominance near threshold is clearly seen in the cross section .",
    "the angular distribution is relatively flat in the cross section but peaked in the photon asymmetry .",
    "in this section we define our coordinate system and discuss some kinematic aspects of the exclusive reaction @xmath62 and the inclusive reaction @xmath23 on nuclei . in the laboratory frame , the four - momenta of the incoming photon is @xmath63 while the outgoing eta and nucleon have four - momenta of @xmath64 and @xmath65 respectively .",
    "the target nucleus is at rest with mass @xmath66 and the recoiling residual nucleus of mass @xmath67 has momentum @xmath68 and kinetic energy @xmath69 .",
    "the momentum transfer @xmath70 is sometimes also called the missing momentum .",
    "overall energy conservation requires @xmath71 as shown in fig .",
    "[ etaxyz ] , the z - axis is defined by the photon direction @xmath72 , and we choose the azimuthal angle of the eta , @xmath73 , by defining @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "we assume that the reaction takes place on a single bound nucleon with four -momentum @xmath76 and that energy and momentum are conserved at this vertex ( i.e. , the impulse approximation ) .",
    "thus @xmath77 and @xmath78 . if @xmath70 does not vanish , the struck nucleon is off its mass shell . for exclusive reactions",
    "this is the only reasonable off - shell choice since the photon , the eta , the outgoing nucleon , and the recoiling nucleus are all external lines and must be on their respective mass shells . for the inclusive reaction we make the same choice .",
    "the magnitude of the momentum transfer to the recoiling nucleus has a wide range , including zero , depending on the directions of the outgoing eta and nucleon with respect to the incident photon beam .",
    "however , since the reaction amplitude is proportional to the fourier transform of the bound state single particle wavefunction , it becomes quite small for momentum transfers greater than about 300 mev / c .",
    "thus for all but the lightest nuclei we can safely neglect the nuclear recoil velocity and generate optical potentials for the outgoing particles in the laboratory frame . as noted in @xcite , reactions of the form @xmath79 on nuclei offer great kinematic flexibility and by appropriate choices one can investigate the production operator , the bound state wavefunction , or the final state interaction of the outgoing meson and nucleon .      in this section",
    "we give the dwia formalism for calculating the quasifree eta photoproduction from nuclei .",
    "following standard procedure , the differential cross section is given by @xmath80 where @xmath81 means sums over final spins and average over initial spins .",
    "the @xmath82-function ensures overall energy - momentum conservation . in impulse approximation",
    ", the many - body matrix element can be written as a sum over single particle states @xmath83 @xmath84 where @xmath85 is a destruction operator and @xmath86 the eta photoproduction on - body operator .",
    "the overlap @xmath87 is conventionally called the spectroscopic factor which can be determined from electron scattering . after integrating over @xmath88 and performing the sums , one arrives at the differential cross section @xmath89 where the single particle matrix element @xmath90 is given by @xmath91 in this equation @xmath92 is the photon polarization , @xmath93 the spin projection of the outgoing nucleon , @xmath94 and @xmath95 the distorted wavefunctions with outgoing boundary condition , and @xmath96 the bound nucleon wavefunction .",
    "another useful observable , the photon asymmetry , is defined by @xmath97 where @xmath98 and @xmath99 denote the perpendicular and parallel photon polarizations relative to the production plane ( x - z plane ) .",
    "we have used the short - hand notation @xmath100 .      as discussed in the section on kinematics ,",
    "we are primarily interested in cases of low momentum transfer to the recoiling nucleus",
    ". thus our choice of single particle wavefunctions for the bound state is not critical as long as the basic size of the orbital is described correctly . for convenience we will use harmonic oscillator wavefunctions which have the advantage that their fourier transforms are simply obtained . for each nucleus under consideration , we adjust the harmonic oscillator range parameter until the rms radius of the ground state charge distribution agrees with the experimentally determined values .    for the continuum nucleon wavefunctions",
    "we solve the schrdinger equation with an optical potential present whenever the particle is to be detected . for exclusive reactins ,",
    "we use the experimentally determined separation energies for a given orbital in order to fix the value of the mass of the recoiling nucleus @xmath67 .",
    "when we are studying the inclusive @xmath23 reaction we allow for all possible final states by using a plane wave for the proton and taking the mass of the recoiling nucleus to be equal to the ground state of the a-1 system . in previous work on@xmath101 reactions from nuclei in the quasielastic region  @xcite we found that an assumption similar to this described the experimental results very well .",
    "many optical models for the outgoing nucleon are available .",
    "we use a non - relativistic reduction of the global optical model in ref .",
    "this model has the advantage that it fits nucleon scattering over a wide range of energy and a values , and hence is very useful for making surveys of a wide range of possible experimental situations .",
    "once experimental data is available for the exclusive reaction , an optical model specific to the nucleus and energy range of the outgoing nucleon can be substituted .      in order to reduce the @xmath0-nucleus many body problem to an equivalent potential scattering problem",
    ", we construct a simple optical potential .",

    ", one can use the following scattering length and effective range expansion which accurately represents the original dominant @xmath120 amplitude : @xmath121 with @xmath122 we call the optical potential based on this amplitude dw2 .",
    "it has been pointed out in several references  @xcite that a fit to total @xmath13 data based on the optical theorem requires the imaginary part of the @xmath4 scattering length to be larger than roughly 0.22 fm .",

    "we see that the real parts are roughly the same for energies larger than 50 mev , but the imaginary parts , which determine absorption , are quite different . as we will see later , it is the imaginary part that most strongly influences inclusive reactions from nuclei .",
    "it is interesting to note that for small eta energies the real part of b is positive ( more so for dw2 than for dw1 ) which indicates an attractive potential ( see eq .",
    "( [ pot ] ) ) .",
    "this has led to the suggestion that the @xmath0-nucleus system may form hadronic bound states  @xcite . in the following investigations ,",

    "the exclusive reaction @xmath7 where b is in some specific final state offers a wide range of experimental possibilities . in order not to be overwhelmed with details ,",
    "we will concentrate on cases where the momentum transfer to the recoiling nucleus is allowed to vary freely .",

    "the results correspond to knocking out a proton in the @xmath127 orbital of the target nuclei whose momentum distribution is largely responsible for the double peaks in the cross sections .",

    "this insensitivity to the real part of the optical potential can be used to determine the imaginary parts of different @xmath0-nucleus potentials .",

    "the dw2 optical model furnishes a better description of the data , while at larger angles , the dw1 optical model is much better .",
    "it could be that the real parts of the optical potentials are playing some role here .    to obtain the total cross section in our model for the quasifree eta photoproduction from nuclei , we need to perform extensive integrations which are 4-fold altogether ( the @xmath147 integration gives @xmath148 due to the azimuthal symmetry after @xmath134 is performed ) .",
    "these integrations are done numerically using gauss method .",
    "the cross sections are concentrated in a limited region of phase space , outside of which they are suppressed due to large momentum transfers .",
    "we adjusted the integration limits , the number of integration points , and the number of partial waves , until convergence in the total cross section is achieved .",
    "we arranged the program in such a way that the differential cross sections discussed above @xmath149 , @xmath142 , @xmath144 , are saved as intermediate results in the same run for the total cross section .",
    "we calculated at three photon energies @xmath137=700 mev , 750 mev , 780 mev and interpolated to other energies since the total cross section is expected to be a smooth function of @xmath137 .",

    "the absorption present in dw2 , calculated in our model , appears too strong .",
    "we have developed a dwia model for quasifree eta photoproduction on nuclei @xmath7 .",
    "the three key ingredients of the model are single particle bound state wave functions ; the elementary eta photoproduction amplitudes ; and the final state interactions .",

    "furthermore by using the kinematic flexibility present in the reaction , one can emphasize one or more of the ingredients .",
    "in particular , with the exclusive reaction , kinematics can be chosen so that the momentum transfer to the recoiling a-1 nucleus is quite small and hence the calculated cross sections are quite insensitive to the bound state wavefunction .",
    "we found that the exclusive reaction cross sections and , in particular , the photon asymmetry are very sensitive to possible medium modifications of the intermediate nucleon resonances .",
    "we recommend that exclusive cross sections be measured , and once polarized photons are avaiable in this energy range , that the photon asymmetry be measured .",
    "this reaction seems to be the cleanest one available for determining whether or not intermediate resonant states are different in the nuclear medium than in free space .    while exclusive cross section data is not yet available ,",
    "there has been a series of inclusive cross section measurements from mainz .",
    "we have compared our model to the recent inclusive data on @xmath10 and @xmath11 from mainz and we find good agreement in our model when we use an @xmath0-nucleus optical potential based on the work of bennhold and tanabe  @xcite . a second optical potential developed in ref .",
    "@xcite appears to have too much absorption .",
    "we conclude that @xmath0 photoproduction from nuclei provides a good tool to extract properties of the @xmath5 interaction .",
    "we thank b. krusche and m. rbig - landau for helpful discussions and for making their data available to us before publication , and a. svarc and m. batinic for providing a convenient expansion of their @xmath4 amplitude .",
