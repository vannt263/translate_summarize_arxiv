    "the study of extrasolar planets is scientifically and culturally important , and after a late start @xcite the number of known planets is escalating rapidly .",
    "transiting planets are the crown jewels of this population as , with the exception of our own solar system , they are the only planets whose masses and radii are directly measurable . in addition to this , it is possible to put constraints on the properties of their atmospheres , in which much interesting physics occurs , through measurements of the depths of transits and occultations at different wavelengths .    whilst transiting extrasolar planets ( teps ) offer unique scientific possibilities , their study involves several complications .",
    "the most significant is that it is not in general possible to measure the mass and radius of a planet through basic observations alone .",
    "additional constraints are needed , and are usually provided by forcing the properties of the host stars to match theoretical expectations .",
    "this introduces not only a model dependence ( i.e.  systematic error ) , but also the possibility of inconsistent results if different theoretical predictions are used for some teps .",
    "systematic errors can blur any distinctions between planets , making it hard to pick out discrete groups of teps from the varied general population .",
    "this systematic error can not be abolished , but it can at least be standardised . in this series of papers",
    "i am analysing the known transiting systems using rigorously homogeneous methods , with the aim of removing the systematic differences in measurements of the physical properties of teps .",
    "the resulting physical properties are therefore statistically compatible , and any structure in distributions of parameters is maximised .",
    "in paperi @xcite i analysed the light curves of the fourteen transiting systems for which high - precision photometry was then available , paying careful attention to the role of limb darkening and to the estimation of comprehensive errorbars .",
    "paperii @xcite used these results plus the predictions of three different theoretical stellar models to measure the physical properties of the fourteen teps . in this work",
    "i broaden the analysis to thirty teps and five sets of theoretical stellar models , resulting in improved statistics and better systematic error estimates .",
    "there are a few homogeneous analyses of transiting systems available in the literature .",
    "a good analysis of 23 systems was presented by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter twh08 ) , but these authors tried only two different theoretical model sets and did not assign systematic errors to their results .",
    "analogously , such work would also benefit from homogeneous analysis of the spectra of the host stars in order to put their effective temperature and chemical abundance measurements on a consistent scale .",
    "steps towards this goal were pioneered by @xcite and are being continued by @xcite and @xcite , but a homogeneous study of the host stars of all known teps is not currently available .    in sect.[sec",
    ": lc ] i present the methods used to analyse the light curves of the thirty teps included in this work .",
    "sect.[sec : model ] discusses the five theoretical stellar model sets and their application to determining the physical properties of the teps .",
    "sect.[sec : teps ] presents the new results for these objects , sect.[sec : syserr ] discusses the influence of systematic errors due to the use of theoretical models , and in sect.[sec : absdim ] i summarise the physical properties of the known teps and explore correlations between various parameters . those readers interested in the general properties of teps rather than specific systems can skip sect.[sec : teps ] without problem .",
    "i have modelled the light curves of each tep using the jktebopjkt / codes / jktebop.html ] code @xcite .",
    "jktebop grew out of the original ebop program written for eclipsing binary star systems @xcite and implementing the nde model @xcite .",
    "jktebop uses biaxial spheroids to model the component stars ( or star and planet ) so allows for departures from sphericity .",
    "the shapes of the components are governed by the mass ratio , @xmath1 , although the results in this work are all extremely insensitive to the value of this parameter .",
    "the main parameters of a jktebop fit are the orbital inclination , @xmath2 , and the fractional radii of the two stars , @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the fractional radii are defined as @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the stellar and planetary radii and @xmath8 is the orbital semimajor axis . @xmath3 and @xmath4 correspond to radii of spheres of the same volume as the biaxial spheroids . in jktebop the fractional radii",
    "are re - parameterised as their sum and ratio : @xmath9 because these are only weakly correlated with each other . in general the orbital period , @xmath10 ,",
    "is taken from the literature and the time of transit midpoint , @xmath11 , is included as a fitted parameter in each jktebop run .",
    "the limb darkening ( ld ) of the star is an important ` nuisance parameter ' affecting transit light curves which can be parametrised using any of five ld laws in jktebop . wherever possible",
    "the ld coefficients are included as fitted parameters , but when there is insufficient information for this the coefficients are fixed at theoretical values . for each light curve",
    "i have obtained solutions with each of the five ld laws ( see paperi for their definition ) and with both ld coefficients fixed , with the linear coefficient fitted and the nonlinear coefficient fixed ( hereafter referred to as ` ld fit / fix ' ) , and with both coefficients fitted .",
    "theoretical ld coefficients have been taken from @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the tabulated values have been bilinearly interpolated , using the jktld codejkt / codes / jktld.html ] , to the known effective temperature ( @xmath12 ) and surface gravity ( @xmath13 ) of the star .",
    "i find that there is usually a spread of 0.10.2 in the theoretical ld coefficients for cool stars , so when the nonlinear ld coefficient is not included as a fitted parameter it is perturbed in the monte carlo simulations by @xmath140.1 on a flat distribution to account for this .",
    "the dependence on theoretical calculations in this case is still exceptionally small , because the linear and nonlinear coefficients of the ld laws are highly correlated with each other @xcite .",
    "once solutions have been obtained for the five ld laws , the final result is calculated by taking the weighted means of the parameter values for the four two - parameter ld laws ( i.e.  the linear law is not used ) .",
    "the parameter errorbars are taken to be the largest of the individual errorbars ( see below ) plus a contribution to account for scatter of the parameter values from different ld law solutions .",
    "for each solution i run 1000 monte carlo simulations @xcite to provide robust estimates of the 1@xmath0 statistical errorbars .",
    "the starting parameter values are perturbed for each simulation to avoid sticking artificially close to the original best fit . if the reduced @xmath15 of the fit , @xmath16 , is greater than unity , the monte carlo errorbars are multiplied by @xmath17 to account for this .",
    "monte carlo simulations do not fully account for the presence of correlated ( ` red ' ) noise , which is an unavoidable reality in high - precision light curves of bright stars .",
    "i therefore also run a residual permutation ( or `` prayer bead '' ) algorithm @xcite with the quadratic ld law .",
    "if there is significant correlated noise the residual - permutation errorbars will exceed the monte - carlo errorbars .",
    "i then take the larger of the two error estimates to represent the final errorbars of the photometric parameters .",
    "some teps have a non - circular orbit which must be accounted for in the light curve analysis .",
    "orbital eccentricity is very difficult to detect from the shape of a transit light curve @xcite but can have a significant effect on the resulting parameters ( for an example see sect.[sec : teps : xo3 ] ) .",
    "non - circular orbits normally become apparent from radial velocity ( rv ) measurements of the parent stars .",
    "these rvs can then be used to determine the eccentricity , @xmath18 , and the longitude of periastron , @xmath19 , of the binary orbit ,    jktebop has been modified to account for orbital eccentricity by including the possibility of specifying values for either @xmath18 and @xmath19 or the combinations @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "these values and their uncertainties are then simply treated as extra observations , and @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( or their combinations ) are included as fitted parameters . in this way the uncertainties in @xmath18 and @xmath19 are correctly propagated into the errorbars in the other photometric parameters .",
    "i prefer to work with @xmath20 and @xmath21 rather than @xmath18 and @xmath19 , because the latter two quantities are strongly correlated with each other ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it is possible for additional light to contaminate photometric observations of transiting planets .",
    "any extra light from nearby faint stars will dilute the transit depth , causing a systematic error in the light curve parameters .",
    "this idea is becoming more important for several reasons .",
    "firstly , the corot satellite has a large point spread function ( psf ) which usually contains a number of stars aside from the one hosting a transiting planet .",
    "secondly , observations using telescope defocussing are potentially more susceptible to contaminating light .",
    "thirdly , @xcite have detected faint companions to three transiting systems ( tres-2 , tres-4 and wasp-2 ) from ground - based high - resolution observations of fourteen teps obtained with a lucky - imaging camera .",
    "these companions could be bound to their respective transiting systems , or may just be asterisms .    temporarily ignoring the orbital ephemeris ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 )",
    ", there are three main observables in a transit shape : its depth , duration , and the duration of totality ( paperi ) . from transit light curves we measure three quantities , which in the case of jktebop are @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath2",
    "it is therefore expected to be impossible to fit directly for contaminating light , as this would require measuring four independent parameters using only three observables .",
    "this expectation will now be verified .",
    "plot of the variation of parameters fitted to a set of synthetic transit light curves with 1mmag of gaussian noise added .",
    "the synthetic datasets were generated for a range of third light values but fitted with the assumption of @xmath22 .",
    "dotted lines show the input parameter values for the synthetic light curve calculations . ]",
    "i have explored the possibility of measuring contaminating light by simulating a set of light curves with reasonable parameters ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) .",
    "i added contaminating light ( by convention referred to as ` third light ' and expressed as a fraction of the total system light ) by amounts ranging from @xmath22 to 0.75 in steps of 0.05 .",
    "these were transformed into typical good ground - based light curves by retaining approximately 400 points within each transit and adding a gaussian scatter with standard deviation 1mmag .",
    "these synthetic light curves were then fitted with jktebop under the assumption that @xmath22 .",
    "the results ( fig.[fig : lc : l3:zero ] ) show that the presence of @xmath26 results in systematic overestimates of @xmath3 and underestimates of @xmath4 and @xmath2 .",
    "the bottom panel of fig.[fig : lc : l3:zero ] shows that the quality of the fit does _ not _ get worse as @xmath26 increases .",
    "unaccounted third light therefore biases the resulting parameters without being detectable through its impact on the quality of the fit .",
    "plot of fitted versus input values of third light for the same light curves as in fig.[fig : lc : l3:zero ] , but with @xmath26 included as a fitted parameter .",
    "the dotted line shows parity .",
    "note the large scale on the @xmath27-axis . ]    as a second test i modelled the same synthetic light curves again , this time fitting for third light .",
    "the resulting values of @xmath26 are shown in fig.[fig : lc : l3:comp ] and are extremely scattered as well as biased to smaller values .",
    "jktebop deliberately does not restrict photometric parameters to physically realistic values ( e.g.  @xmath28 ) , to avoid statistical biases in the uncertainties arising from monte carlo simulations .",
    "fig.[fig : lc : l3:comp ] demonstrates that there _ is _ a very small amount of information on @xmath26 in a good ground - based light curve , but that this information is far too sparse to be useful .",
    "fig.[fig : lc : l3:nonzero ] shows the resulting values of the other main parameters : @xmath4 and @xmath2 are biased towards lower values and there is no trend visible in the sizes of the residuals .    in reality a large value of @xmath26 is not expected because such a bright star would show up in the spectroscopic observations of a transiting system .",
    "fainter stars can be found via high - resolution imaging if they are slightly away from the planet host star @xcite .",
    "but it may never be possible to rule out the presence of a much fainter star ( @xmath29% depending on the quality of the spectroscopic observations ) which almost exactly coincide with the planet host . as a guide , 5% of third light",
    "can be compensated for by increasing @xmath3 by 1% , and decreasing @xmath4 by 2% and @xmath2 by 0.1@xmath30 .",
    "it can therefore change the derived radius of the planet by several percent .",
    "plot of the variation of parameters fitted to the same light curves as in fig.[fig : lc : l3:zero ] , but in this case with @xmath26 included as a fitted parameter .",
    "the dotted lines show parity . ]",
    "the observations of @xcite make it possible to account for third light when analysing transit light curves .",
    "they measured magnitude differences ( light ratios ) in the sdss @xmath2 and @xmath31 passbands .",
    "when necessary i have propagated the light ratios to other passbands by convolving synthetic spectra from atlas9 model atmospheres @xcite with passband response functions made available by the isaac newton group .",
    "armed with @xmath26 values for the correct passbands , i have included these in the same way as @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "jktebop was modified to accept measured @xmath26 values as observations , and @xmath26 was included as a fitted parameter .",
    "note that several published studies have instead simply subtracted @xmath26 from a light curve before analysis , which is statistically incorrect as it neglects the uncertainty in @xmath26 .",
    "@xcite surveyed fourteen transiting systems and detected faint companions to three of them .",
    "the companions are within 0.71.6@xmath32  of the transit host stars , and are fainter by generally 4mag in the @xmath2 band .",
    "daemgen et al",
    ".  found that their presence changed the physical properties of the teps by roughly 1@xmath0 .",
    "of the three affected objects , tres-2 and tres-4 are analysed in the current work and wasp-2 is the subject of a separate publication @xcite .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     in this paper i present analyses of published transit light curves of fifteen teps ( table[tab : teps : lcpar ] )",
    ". three of these ( tres-2 , tres-4 and wasp-2 ) have faint companion stars within 1.6@xmath32  on the sky @xcite .",
    "if neglected , this ` third light ' dilutes the transit depth and causes systematic errors in parameters measured from the light curves . as a guideline , @xmath33% causes the radius of a representative planet to be underestimated by 2% .",
    "i show that it is not possible to detect third light in synthetic light curves representative of good ground - based observations .",
    "a third light value must instead be measured and used to constrain the light curve solutions .    in the second stage of the analysis of each tep ,",
    "i augment the light curve results with measurements of the velocity amplitude , @xmath12  and @xmath34 $ ]  for its parent star .",
    "i then interpolate within tabulated predictions from theoretical stellar models to find the overall best - fitting physical properties of the star and the planet . this model dependence causes systematic errors in the resulting quantities , which i assess by comparing the individual results found using five independent sets of theoretical model predictions .",
    "this leads also to ` consensus values ' for the physical properties ; the yonsei - yale models are overall the closest to this consensus .",
    "measurements of three physical properties are exempt from this model dependence : the planetary surface gravity can be determined from only observed quantities ; the density of the star has only a negligible dependence on stellar models ; and the planet s equilibrium temperature does not depend on stellar models but does rest on the effective temperature scale of low - mass ( f , g and k ) stars .",
    "the model dependence specifies a minimum level of uncertainty for other physical properties , and this ranges from 1% for @xmath35 to 0.6% for @xmath36 and 0.3% for @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 . reducing these minimum levels",
    "will require improvements in our understanding of low - mass stars .",
    "an external test of systematic errors was obtained by comparing the discovery papers of the wasp-11/hat - p-10 system .",
    "the agreement between the two studies is good for most parameters , but less so for the transit depth and the stellar @xmath12 .",
    "tables [ tab : absdim : stars ] and [ tab : absdim : planets ] summarise the physical properties of thirty teps : the fifteen with light curve analyses in the current work plus another fifteen with photometric analyses in paperi and later works . the statistical errors in these quantities are calculated using a perturbation analysis which returns complete error budgets for each output parameter .",
    "these error budgets indicate which type of follow - up observations are the best way of improving the parameter measurements for each tep . in",
    "most the quality of the light curve is the primary limitation on measurements of the properties of the planet ; many systems would also benefit from additional spectroscopic observations .",
    "this is summarised in table[tab : absdim : obs ] for the benefit of follow - up programmes .",
    "the measured properties of the 30 teps were then reinforced with those of the other 35 known objects and plotted in several parameter diagrams .",
    "i find that the correlation between orbital period and planetary surface gravity is significant at the 3.1@xmath0 level once clear outliers are thrown out  this significance has increased with the addition of new systems since paperii .",
    "the period vs.  planetary mass correlation has a significance of only 2.3@xmath0 , and this _ not _ increased since paperii .",
    "similarly , the distinction between classi and classii planets in the @xmath37  vs.  @xmath38  diagram is blurring into irrelevance .    in this work",
    "i have now treated 30 teps , including all currently known from the ogle , tres and xo surveys .",
    "the discovery rate of transiting planets is expected to continue rising , as the ground - based surveys hat and wasp mature and new areas of parameter space are probed by the space missions corot and _ kepler_. a homogeneous study of the atmospheric parameters of all tep host stars would be very complementary to this work .",
    "whilst the light curves obtained by corot and _ kepler _ are of extremely high quality , it should not be forgotten that extensive velocity observations are also needed to study transiting systems in detail .",
    "precise physical properties of transiting planets are a fundamental requirement of constraining the atmospheric characteristics , formation and evolution of planetary systems .",
    "i acknowledge financial support from stfc in the form of a postdoctoral research assistant position , and a timely and useful report from the anonymous referee .",
    "i am grateful to barry smalley , andrew collier cameron , pierre maxted and aaron dotter for discussions , and to adriano pietrinferni , emma nasi and antonio claret for calculating stellar model sets for me .",
