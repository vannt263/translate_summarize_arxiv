    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , it is not possible to place constraints on either the density distribution or size of a disk without spatially resolved data . in principle , the combination of a complete sed and a spatially resolved image can be used to determine these parameters with a direct fit to a disk model .",
    "one simple case is the  flat \" disk model , which allows for a continuous radial distribution of material with power - law forms for the temperature and surface density @xcite .",
    "this model is able to reproduce the seds and submillimeter images of typical circumstellar disks quite well , and serves as a reasonable approximation for the more detailed structure of a realistic accretion disk .",
    "more sophisticated models have been advanced to address the observational and theoretical shortcomings of this model ( for reviews , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for example , a disk subject to hydrostatic equilibrium in the vertical direction is flared , and therefore has an increased illuminated surface area at radii corresponding to temperatures that produce mid- and far - infrared emission @xcite . however , because most of the submillimeter emission is generated near the midplane of the disk , this vertical flaring does not have a strong effect on the emission at those wavelengths ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "while these more complex models illuminate key properties of disks , the computing power required to estimate their parameters with a minimization technique can be formidable .",
    "based on this fact and the size and quality of the sample presented here , we focus on interpreting these data in terms of the comparatively simple flat disk description .      in the flat disk model ,",
    "photospheric excess emission is generated by thermal reprocessing of starlight by a geometrically thin dust disk with radial temperature ( @xmath21 ) and surface density ( @xmath22 ) profiles described by power - laws : @xmath23 @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the temperature at 1au and @xmath26 is the surface density at 5au ( the normalization of @xmath22 is selected for comparison to jupiter ) . by further assuming an opacity spectrum that is a power - law in frequency and independent of radius , @xmath27 the flux density ( @xmath28 ) at any frequency can be determined by summing the thermal emission from annuli weighted by the optical depth ( @xmath29 ) , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the disk inclination angle ( 90  is edge - on ) , @xmath32 is the distance , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the inner and outer disk edges , respectively , and @xmath35 is the planck function at the given radial temperature .",
    "this model is completely described by a set of 9 parameters , \\{@xmath31 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath36 , @xmath7 , @xmath25 , @xmath37 , @xmath26 , @xmath38}.    with only the unresolved sed , it is not possible to uniquely determine most of these parameters ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also chiang et al .",
    "2001 for a similar discussion with more sophisticated models ) . in light of this fact , the standard adopted",
    "procedure is to fix a subset of the parameters based on reasonable assumptions , usually \\{@xmath31 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath36 , @xmath7 , @xmath38 } , and fit to the data to determine the others ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , when information about the spatial distribution of emission at one or more frequencies becomes available , some of the inherent parameter degeneracies can be broken .",
    "the flat disk model can be easily adapted to generate two - dimensional images at the expense of introducing the disk orientation , or position angle ( pa ) , as an additional parameter .      to estimate flat disk model parameters for this sample , we adopt a minimization technique that simultaneously fits both the sed and the spatial distribution of continuum emission at one submillimeter wavelength .",
    "the latter is treated in the fourier plane to avoid the nonlinearities associated with deconvolution and to properly account for the spatial response of the interferometer . to further simplify and expedite the process computationally",
    ", we utilize the circular symmetry of the flat disk model ( after accounting for inclination and orientation effects ) to represent the spatial distribution of emission via the one - dimensional visibility profile , @xmath39 , the vector - averaged visibilities in annular bins of spatial frequency distance , @xmath40 .",
    "to summarize , the minimization process is as follows : ( 1 ) for a given parameter set , generate a sed and submillimeter image as described in the previous section ; ( 2 ) take the fourier transform of the image and sample it only at the same spatial frequencies used in the observations ; ( 3 ) bin the sparsely sampled fourier transform of the image into a visibility profile ; and ( 4 ) calculate the combined @xmath41 value for the sed and visibility profile .",
    "this minimization method is basically a hybrid of those developed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the significant differences from the former ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are that we choose to simultaneously use seds in the fits and to use vector - averaging for the visibilities rather than scalar - averaging ( for the visibility amplitudes ) .",
    "the main departure from the method adopted by @xcite is our preference to use the visibilities rather than synthesized images in the fits .",
    "data from the literature were used to compile full seds for the survey sample , with references given in the appendix for individual disks . because near - infrared and shorter wavelengths are sensitive to emission from the extincted stellar photosphere , accretion , and the inner disk rim , only wavelengths of @xmath98@xmath10 m or longer were used in the fits .",
    "each sed was de - reddened based on the @xmath42 values listed in table [ stars_table ] and the interstellar extinction law compiled by @xcite .",
    "the exact extinction values are insignificant at the fitted wavelengths unless @xmath42 is very high .",
    "when available , _ iras _ flux densities were color - corrected following the prescription of @xcite .",
    "errors on the flux densities were computed as the quadrature sum of statistical and systematic uncertainties , the latter based on the uncertainties in the absolute calibration scales .",
    "continuum visibility profiles were generated from the sma data with a typical bin width of 15k@xmath43 .",
    "the visibility profile errors represent both the ( comparatively small ) statistical error on the average and the standard deviation in each bin .",
    "a properly sampled 10-dimensional parameter grid for this minimization technique would be computationally prohibitive and unwarranted given the typical signal - to - noise ratios in the data .",
    "fortunately , some of these parameters can be estimated independently .",
    "we have chosen to fix values of \\{@xmath31 , pa , @xmath36 , @xmath7 , @xmath33 } for each individual disk .",
    "the opacity spectrum is discussed in detail in a later section , but here it is defined so that @xmath44 and @xmath45@xmath46 g@xmath47 at 1000ghz ( this value implicitly assumes a 100:1 mass ratio between gas and dust ; * ? ? ?",
    "long - baseline near - infrared interferometry @xcite and models of the infrared sed @xcite can provide independent estimates of the inner radius and inclination .",
    "when these are not available we fix @xmath48au as a typical value , knowing that this parameter does not significantly impact either the sed or the submillimeter visibility profile ( provided it is not too large ) .",
    "inclinations for some disks in the sample have been inferred from the kinematics of molecular line emission @xcite or scattered light signatures @xcite . in other cases ,",
    "we have estimated @xmath31 from elliptical gaussian fits to the continuum visibilities ( see table [ cont_table ] and discussion in  3.4 ) .",

    "the values of @xmath38 and @xmath34 were limited in the fitting to reasonable ranges ; @xmath52 \\{0.0 , 2.0 } and @xmath53 \\{25 , 1000}. the values of the other fitted parameters were determined by refining a search over a wide range to a smaller subset with a lower @xmath49 threshold ( this is the same as the method devised by * ? ? ?",
    "the resulting best - fit disk structure parameter values and their 1@xmath15 errors are compiled in table [ structure_table ] , as well as total disk mass estimates ( @xmath54 , from a direct integration of the best - fit surface density profile ) , and values and references for the fixed parameter subset \\{@xmath33 , @xmath31 , pa}. the total reduced @xmath41 values for the sample range from 0.5 to @xmath93 , with a median value of @xmath91.8 . in many cases ,",
    "much of the discrepancy between the model and the data can be attributed to absolute flux calibration uncertainties in the sed , particularly at submillimeter wavelengths where calibration accuracy is especially difficult .",
    "the data for the class i object wl 20 ( s ) was excluded from these fits because the sed has the clear steep rise in the infrared expected from extended envelope emission ( see fig .",

    "modifications to the minimization description above had to be made for 3 other disks in the sample .",
    "the dm tau and gm aur disks are known to have large central holes ( i.e. , large @xmath33 ; * ? ? ?",

    "the adopted outer disk ( @xmath56au ) temperature distributions are based on power - law approximations of the midplane temperature distributions computed by @xcite from detailed models of irradiated viscous accretion disks .",
    "the @xcite models were chosen to have central stars with roughly the same spectral types and ages ( @xmath91myr ) as these disks , along with appropriate mass accretion rates ( _ m _ @xmath57 and @xmath58m@xmath20 yr@xmath47 for dm tau and gm aur , respectively ) and other standard disk properties ( @xmath59 , grain size distribution index of 3.5 , maximum grain size of 1 mm ) .",
    "the same procedure was adopted for doar 25 ( assuming an age of 1myr and _ m _",

    "@xmath60m@xmath20 yr@xmath47 @xcite .",
    "although the flat disk model is a computationally expedient approximation of a more detailed structure model , it contains a number of implicit assumptions which deserve to be highlighted . of these ,",
    "the most significant is the requirement that the spatial distributions of temperature and density follow power - law behaviors with the same index ( @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively ) _ across the entire extent of the disk_. furthermore , the vertical structure of the disk is altogether ignored , despite the fact that flaring is expected based on hydrostatic equilibrium @xcite . an over - simplified opacity function , particularly its presumed spatial uniformity in the disk , represents another critical assumption in the model . in general ,",
    "each of the individual parameters in the flat disk model can have a significant impact on both the sed and visibility profile .    in a fit of the flat disk model to a dataset , the radial temperature profile ( parameters \\{@xmath25 , @xmath37 } ) is essentially fixed by the intensity and shape of the infrared sed .",
    "this is due to the fact that for the standard opacity prescription and any reasonable density values , the infrared emission generated in the inner disk is completely optically thick . in this case @xmath61 , and equation 4",

    "most of the submillimeter emission should be optically thin @xcite . in this case @xmath63 , and the flux density from equation 4 becomes @xmath64 where we have assumed that the the rayleigh - jeans limit applies and @xmath65 .. if @xmath66 , the optically thin flux density goes as @xmath67 . ]",
    "the integrand in the second proportionality gives the radial surface brightness , @xmath68 , and the visibility profile , @xmath39 , as its fourier transform @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the spatial frequency distance ( cf .",
    "equations 6 and 7 are simplified representations of a more complex situation . in reality",
    "some of the submillimeter emission is generated in the inner disk where optical depths are high , thereby complicating the parameter relationships ( for details , see * ? ? ?",
    "however , these relations are good first - order approximations and serve to illustrate a key component of the flat disk model : the outer , more optically thin part of the disk sets the density profile , which is then assumed to extrapolate into the inner regions .    to illustrate these dependencies with an example related to fitting real data , consider an adjustment that decreases the value of the power - law index of the surface density profile , @xmath38 ( i.e. , a redistribution of mass to larger radii )",
    ". this would act to increase both the submillimeter flux densities and the surface brightness at larger radii , thus making the visibility profile drop off more rapidly at shorter spatial frequency distances ( see equations 6 and 7 ) . keeping in mind that the temperature profile is set in the infrared , compensating for the drop of @xmath38 in a fit would require a decrease in the surface density normalization ( @xmath26 ) and/or outer radius ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "this interplay between parameters is a manifestation of the submillimeter emission in the outer disk being mostly optically thin .",
    "as would be expected , a sharp outer radius cutoff more strongly affects the observables for shallower density profiles ( i.e. , lower @xmath38 ) , whereas the outer radius quickly becomes negligible ( and thus poorly constrained ) as the density profile steepens ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the above discussion reiterates that the assumptions of single power - laws for the temperature and density across the entire disk are critical . without them",
    ", we could not assume that the inner disk temperature profile is applicable in the outer disk or vice versa for the outer disk density profile .",
    "the other parameters that were fixed in the model have more complicated effects on the data .",
    "to start , the location of the inner radius really affects only the infrared sed , such that larger @xmath33 would decrease fluxes at those wavelengths .",
    "generally this is not an issue , as the shorter infrared wavelengths are not used in the fits ( however , see the appendix regarding disks with large @xmath33 ) .",
    "the effects of the opacity can be significant , and are discussed in their own right in the following sections .",
    "the projected disk geometry , characterized by \\{@xmath31 , pa } and fixed in the minimization algorithm used here , can significantly influence the other parameters in the flat disk model .",
    "several of the disks in the sample have reliable geometry constraints from independent measurements ( see the notes in table [ structure_table ] ) , but in most cases we derive \\{@xmath31 , pa } from elliptical gaussian fits to the continuum visibilities . in such cases ,",
    "a natural concern is that these gaussian geometries do not represent the true disk geometries . to test the validity of using the gaussian fits , we created synthetic continuum images using the flat disk formalism described above with a variety of parameter sets , inclinations , and orientations .",
    "these synthetic images were then  observed \" in the same way as the data , for both the compact ( c2 ) and extended ( e ) sma configurations and with the appropriate thermal noise added to reproduce typical signal - to - noise levels .",
    "the geometries derived from elliptical gaussian fits to the synthetic visibilities can then be compared to the known input geometries from the flat disk model . in general , the gaussian inclinations yield fairly accurate results , but a few important points should be addressed .",
    "first , inclinations based on gaussian fits are better approximations when surface brightness profiles are shallow ( e.g. , for lower values of @xmath38 ) .",
    "second , coverage in the fourier plane is important : the gaussian inclinations are more accurate with the combined c2+e array configuration ( note that the c1 configuration is basically intermediate to the c2 and c2+e cases ) .",
    "and third , the gaussian fits tend to slightly underestimate intermediate and high inclinations ( by @xmath910  at most ) , and overestimate low inclinations ( by up to @xmath915@xmath1320 ) .",
    "to investigate the effects of fixing an erroneous value of the inclination in the fitting process , we also generated synthetic seds for the disk models described above .",
    "we then fit the synthetic seds and visibilities for a range of fixed inclination angles , and the best - fit parameter values were compared with the known input values . in general , fixing a value of @xmath31 that is lower than the true value leads to underestimates of other parameters , most importantly \\{@xmath26 , @xmath38 , @xmath34}. the magnitude of this effect depends on several conditions : the true inclination and how severely the assumed inclination underestimates it ; the radial surface brightness distribution ( i.e. , @xmath38 ) ; the relative projections of the surface brightness distribution and the fourier coverage of the interferometric observations ; and the signal - to - noise ratio . as an example , consider a flat disk with a typical inclination of 60 . given the underestimate of @xmath31 expected from a gaussian fit , our simulations indicate that we could underestimate @xmath38 by up to @xmath90.2@xmath130.3 if the true value is @xmath71 .",
    "the underestimate of @xmath38 is insignificant if @xmath72 ( although the other parameters are changed ) . in the end , we are forced to adopt gaussian inclinations as the best information available for many of the sources . in general , we are unlikely to overestimate the inclination in this way simply because nearly face - on disks should be relatively rare ( assuming disk geometries are random ) .",
    "the sense of any effects on the parameters is then as described above , although the exact magnitude is generally unknown .",
    "the analysis described above was also applied to better understand how fixing the disk orientation ( pa ) can affect the fitting results .",
    "fortunately , the gaussian fits effectively reproduce the true orientations in most cases within the errors ( see table [ cont_table ] ) .",
    "the exceptions are for low inclination angles ( where the pa is basically meaningless anyway ) or small radii .",
    "again , any effects the pa could have on the visibility profile depend on the relative orientations of the projected disk emission and the sparsely - sampled fourier coverage afforded by the observations",
    ". however , the agreement between the gaussian fits and simulated data gives us confidence that fixing the disk orientations does not significantly affect the fitting results .",
    "keeping in mind the caveats discussed above , the combined fits of seds and visibilities provide constraints on basic structure parameters for the large number of circumstellar disks in this sample . despite the simplicity of the adopted model and the remaining parameter uncertainties due to limited sensitivity and spatial resolution , we find the following : ( _ a _ ) the variation of temperature with radius is intermediate to the idealized cases of flat and flared disks ; ( _ b _ ) small outer radii can be ruled out for most cases ; and ( _ c _ ) the density apparently drops slowly with radius in the outer disk .",
    "figure [ tr_dists ] shows the distributions for the radial temperature profile parameters @xmath25 and @xmath37 for the sample .",
    "these histograms were created to crudely account for the uncertainties in the parameter measurements as follows . for each disk , we generate a gaussian distribution normalized to have an area of 1 with a mean and standard deviation corresponding to the best - fit parameter value and error in table [ structure_table ] . parameters with asymmetric errors are allowed to have different standard deviations with a discontinuity at the mean ( to ensure a total area of 1 for the distribution ) .",
    "all of the individual error distributions are then summed and binned ( which effectively smooths away any discontinuities ) . in this way ,",
    "the contribution of each disk to the histogram is appropriately weighted according to the uncertainty in the parameter measurement ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* see their fig .",
    "the median values for each parameter are shown with dotted vertical lines .",
    "the 1au temperatures in this sample have a clear , but fairly broad peak centered at @xmath9200k .",
    "the power - law indices ( i.e. , the radial slope of the temperature profile ) also have a peak around the median value @xmath73 , with a few sources having substantially shallower temperature distributions ( lower @xmath37 ) .",
    "this peak in the distribution of the power - law index falls between the idealized values for the flat case , @xmath74 @xcite , and the flared case , @xmath75 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this is probably the result of imposing a simple model upon a more complicated reality . for a typical disk ,",
    "the temperature distribution is determined by the infrared sed from @xmath98@xmath1360@xmath10 m , corresponding to emission produced roughly between @xmath90.5@xmath1330au ( give or take a factor of 2 ) . in detailed physical models of disk structure ,",
    "this corresponds to the region where vertical flaring begins to affect the temperature distribution ; in essence , this is the transition region between the flat and flared scenarios ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "it is therefore not so surprising that the typical _ single _ power - law index derived here lies between the _ two _ indices which better describe a more realistic disk structure .",

    "the distribution of @xmath38 should be treated with particular caution , as the errors on individual measurements are large .",
    "the disks with completely unconstrained @xmath38 values are not included in the distributions in figure [ sdr_dists ] or the analysis that follows .",
    "the distribution of @xmath26 has a broad peak around a median value of @xmath914 g @xmath76 .",
    "the distribution of @xmath38 indicates more disks in this sample have low values ( i.e. , less than @xmath91 ) than high , with a median value of @xmath77 .",
    "the standard of reference often used in discussing the density distribution in circumstellar disks is the minimum mass solar nebula ( mmsn ) , the progenitor circumstellar disk around the sun .",
    "the mmsn density distribution is constructed by augmenting the masses of the planets in the solar system until cosmic abundance values are obtained , and then smearing the mass out into annuli centered on each planet s semimajor axis @xcite . a simple power - law fit to the mmsn surface density distribution indicates @xmath78 g @xmath76 and @xmath71 @xcite , both of which are marked in figure [ sdr_dists ] . as a second reference case , a steady - state viscous accretion disk has @xmath79 , while the normalization depends on a variety of other parameters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the best - fit values of @xmath38 for this sample , while not very strongly constrained , often indicate that the density drops off more slowly in the outer disk than is expected from either the mmsn or the standard viscous accretion disk models .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ sdr ] , where again a comparison can be made between the sample median density distribution and a more sophisticated disk structure model . as with figure [ tr ] , we plot sample median surface densities at some representative radii ( determined from the best - values of \\{@xmath26 , @xmath38 } in table [ structure_table ] ) , with error bars marking the first and third quartiles as an indication of the range in the sample .",
    "overlaid on the plot as a solid curve is the density distribution for the same irradiated accretion disk model described above for figure [ tr ] ( cf .",
    "the mmsn density distribution is also plotted as a dashed line .",
    "observational measurements of the value of @xmath38 in circumstellar disks are critical to developing a better understanding of disk evolution and the planet formation process .",
    "therefore , an examination of possible causes for the apparent disagreement between the typical values measured here ( @xmath80 1 in most cases ) and those expected from theory ( @xmath81 ) is necessary .    in  3.4",
    ", we already highlighted a possible cause of artificially low values of @xmath38 in this sample ; namely , underestimates of the true disk inclination angles . to examine this issue in more detail",
    ", we look at the cases where independent inclination estimates are available ( see col .  11 in table [ structure_table ] ) .",
    "for these disks , the median best - fit value of @xmath38 remains the same as for the full sample , @xmath90.5 .",
    "therefore , for at least some of the disks in this sample , the low measured values of @xmath38 do not arise from erroneous inclination values . without individual constraints on @xmath31 for the remaining sample disks ,",
    "we are forced to rely on the gaussian fits .",
    "as discussed in  3.4 , any induced decrease in @xmath38 is typically expected to be small ( @xmath82 if @xmath83 ) .",
    "another potential issue with the surface density constraints could arise due to the simplified treatment of the disk temperature distribution .",
    "as mentioned above , detailed disk models indicate that the temperatures in the outer disk have a relatively shallow dependence on radius ( due to vertical flaring ) compared to the inner disk , where the temperature distribution is actually constrained by the data @xcite . because of the single power - law assumption for @xmath21 made here , the derived power - law indices ( @xmath37 ) are usually at intermediate values to the flat and flaring regimes in a more realistic disk .",
    "this implies that our temperature distributions could be too steep in the outer regions ; the values of @xmath37 may be too high .",
    "if we were to adopt a lower value of @xmath37 more consistent with the detailed models , equation 7 indicates that the value of @xmath38 should be _ increased _ in order to maintain the shape of the visibility profile .",
    "therefore , the simplified temperature description used here could lead to underestimates of the surface density power - law index , @xmath38 .",
    "in essence , since the quantity @xmath84 is well - constrained by the visibility profile , @xmath85 .",
    "this should only lead to modest increases on the order of @xmath86 , corresponding to the expected difference between the typical measured @xmath37 values and the flared disk @xmath37 values .",
    "other simplified assumptions in the model are not expected to significantly affect our determination of the power - law index of the density distribution .",
    "one such example is the assumed sharp outer disk boundary , compared to the exponentially decreasing density profile expected from the similarity solutions for viscous accretion disks @xcite .",
    "using the solutions described by @xcite , we generated synthetic seds and visibilities with reasonable errors and modeled them with the procedure described in  3 .",
    "as one might expect , these simulations generally reproduce the correct value of @xmath38 , or even slightly higher values due to the steep exponential drop - off in the outer disk .",
    "therefore , the assumption of a sharp outer boundary does not factor into the low @xmath38 values inferred for much of our sample . in the end",
    ", there are two compelling reasons that may explain the shallow outer disk density distributions : over - simplified temperature distributions and possible inclination underestimates .",
    "the correction for the former is expected to be an additive increase @xmath87 .",
    "the magnitude of the adjustment to @xmath38 for the latter is more difficult to predict . assuming that most of the disks in this sample have an intermediate inclination",
    ", we estimate that the correction is typically @xmath88 . given the rather poor constraints on @xmath38 in general and these implied corrections , we suggest that the typical disk in this sample has @xmath89 .",
    "in addition to the density structure , the spatially resolved sma measurements provide valuable new constraints on circumstellar disk sizes .",
    "the top panel of figure [ rm_dist ] shows the distribution of the outer disk radii for this sample , constructed in the same way described above for the temperature and density profile parameters .",
    "the distribution has a peak near the median radius of @xmath9200au , with a roughly gaussian shape and extended large radius wing .",
    "most of the disks are at least partially resolved , with radii larger than @xmath9100au .",
    "the values of @xmath34 measured here technically represent some characteristic radius beyond which the temperature / density conditions in the disk do not produce substantial submillimeter emission compared to the noise levels in the data .",
    "true disk sizes could be larger , but would have to be measured with more optically thick tracers like molecular line emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or optical silhouettes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "finally , as a caution it should be emphasized that elliptical gaussian fits to interferometer data tend to _ underestimate _ disk sizes ( compare the fwhm sizes in table [ cont_table ] with the @xmath34 values in table [ structure_table ] ) .",
    "the problem is really one of contrast , so that the level of discrepancy increases dramatically for more centrally - concentrated surface brightness distributions ( e.g. , for higher values of @xmath38 ) .",
    "armed with constraints on both the density distribution and size of the disk , the total mass is computed by simply integrating the surface density over the disk area .",
    "the distribution of disk masses for the sample is shown in the bottom panel of figure [ rm_dist ] .",
    "a broad peak is seen around the median mass of 0.06m@xmath20 .",
    "it is important to emphasize again that the sample selection criteria explicitly introduce a bias toward more massive disks , and so this distribution in particular is not representative of the typical t tauri disk @xcite . despite the rather large uncertainties in the density distribution and radius parameters ,",
    "the inferred disk masses are constrained within a factor of 2 .",
    "this is due to the low optical depths where the density and radius parameters are measured .",
    "larger uncertainties in the disk masses are due to our limited knowledge of the opacity and the density structure in the inner , optically thick regions of these disks ( both unaccounted for in table [ structure_table ] and figure [ rm_dist ] ; see  5 ) .",
    "no statistically significant correlations between the best - fit disk structure parameters and properties of the central stars ( e.g. , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , age ) or other disk diagnostics ( e.g. , _",
    "m _ ) were found for this sample .",
    "only a marginal trend of increasing 1au temperatures for earlier spectral types is noteworthy .",
    "neither are there any significant differences between disk structure properties among single and multiple star systems , or the two different star - forming regions incorporated into the sample .",
    "this is perhaps not so surprising , considering the limited ranges of star / disk properties in a sample of this size and the remaining uncertainties on the structure parameters .",
    "perhaps the greatest uncertainties in studies of circumstellar disks are related to the growth of grains into larger solids and how this process subsequently shapes the structure , dynamics , and evolution of disk material ( see * ? ? ?",

    "an examination of the evolutionary behaviors of submillimeter emission , mass accretion rates , and disk sizes in figure [ evolve ] and the corresponding typical sed and spatial distribution of emission in figure [ median_data ] indicate that the @xmath121 similarity solution for a fiducial viscous accretion disk model with @xmath59 generally describes a wide range of observed disk properties remarkably well .",
    "the fiducial model with a lower value of @xmath113 ( i.e. , less turbulent viscosity ) tends to over - predict submillimeter fluxes and accretion rates and under - predict disk sizes .",
    "while an increase of @xmath127 to @xmath9100au in this case would help in explaining the observed disk sizes and spatial emission distribution , it would also result in very little evolution in both the submillimeter fluxes and accretion rates , contrary to the observed trends .",
    "the reader is referred to the work of @xcite regarding the effects of variations in other parameters .",
    "we conclude that viscous accretion disks with @xmath59 provide the best general description of the observational properties of the disks in this sample .      in terms of utilizing the density structure of circumstellar disks to better understand the planet formation process",
    ", we can compare with the mmsn and a similar minimum mass  extrasolar \" nebula ( mmen ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as references",
    ". unfortunately , these are not necessarily valuable comparisons .",
    "first , the interferometer data and mmsn / mmen are providing information about different regions in disks ; a direct analogy between the two is still limited by the spatial resolution of the data . and",
    "second , while the circumstellar disk observations provide a measurement of @xmath22 at one instant in an evolution sequence , the mmsn and mmen refer to the density structure _ integrated over the entire evolutionary history _ of the solar and extrasolar disks . in the later evolutionary stages",
    "when planetary embryos have formed and can dynamically influence the disk structure , it would not be so surprising if the density distribution varied significantly from the @xmath130 expected for a steady - state accretion disk .    in that sense",
    ", it is not too much of a concern that the inferred @xmath38 values for disks generally appear to be different than the @xmath131 based on a fit to augmented planetary masses @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been suggested that a double power - law behavior of the mmsn density distribution is more reasonable .",
    "for example , @xcite points out another scenario where @xmath1 for radii less than @xmath910au and @xmath79 for larger radii .",
    "this prescription is in rather good agreement with detailed accretion disk models @xcite .",
    "@xcite point out that , as long as there is sufficient material available , the _ ability to form planets _ does not strongly depend on @xmath38 .",
    "therefore , the real issue of comparison between the observations of circumstellar disks and the requirements of planet formation models lies more with the normalization , and not the shape , of the density distribution .",
    "the important constraint is on how much mass is packed into the area where planets are thought to form .",
    "regardless of whether planets are created by core accretion and gas capture ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , gravitational instability ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or a hybrid scenario ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , all of these models require total masses in the inner disk at least one order of magnitude higher than the values inferred here from the constraints on @xmath22 .",
    "this is illustrated schematically in figure [ planetformation ] , where we have used the best - fit values of \\{@xmath26 , @xmath38 } in table [ structure_table ] to plot cumulative disk masses ( the total mass internal to radius @xmath132 ) as a function of radius for the disks in this sample .",
    "the shaded region in this figure corresponds to the surface density parameters required to provide at least @xmath90.1m@xmath20 of material within a radius of 20au , the typical prerequisite values for current planet formation models .",
    "taking the disk structure constraints at face value would suggest that these disks will not be capable of forming planets on reasonable timescales . however , this is not necessarily the case . as we have emphasized above , the density distribution is currently only measured in the outer disk ( beyond @xmath960au at best ) and the densities in the inner disk are extrapolated from these measurements assuming a very simple structure model . without higher resolution data capable of tracing the inner disk material , we simply do not have a direct constraint on densities in the regions of interest for planet formation .",
    "there is one particularly notable way to reconcile the observationally inferred densities and those required by planet formation models : adjustments to the disk opacity .",
    "the analysis in  4.2 and a number of other studies indicates that dust grains in the outer disk have grown to millimeter - scale sizes .",
    "the presence of a substantial population of _",
    "centimeter_-scale solids has even been inferred for the outer regions of the tw hya disk @xcite .",
    "considering the expected strong radial dependence of collision timescales in the disk , and thus the growth timescales modulo some coagulation probability , a significant population of even larger solids could exist near the midplane in the inner parts of these disks .",
    "obviously , without a proper accounting of larger solids and their distribution with radius in the disk , the opacity formalism adopted in our models is unfortunately primitive and insufficient . because the growth process would serve to decrease",
    "the opacity , reproducing the observed levels of disk emission would require a substantial increase in the densities ( particularly for the inner disk ) .",
    "indeed , the models by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their fig .",
    "3 ) indicate significantly decreased opacities when the maximum grain size is larger or smaller than a few millimeters . of equal importance",
    "is the implicitly assumed mass ratio of gas to dust in the disk midplane .",
    "here we assume the dust phase contributes only @xmath91%  of the mass , as in the interstellar medium .",
    "however , given the preferential sedimentation of larger solids to the midplane , it would not be surprising if the solid mass fraction in the regions responsible for the continuum emission was substantially higher .",
    "larger solid mass fractions would also imply proportionately smaller opacities , and thus higher densities ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in light of all this",
    ", it is likely that our extrapolated estimates of densities in the inner disk are significantly underestimated , at least in part due to a vastly over - simplified prescription for the opacity .",
    "if the average opacity is roughly an order of magnitude lower than we assume , the densities in the typical disk should be sufficient to form planetary systems ( the issue then becomes deciding which formation mechanism is more likely ) .",
    "unfortunately , diagnosing the effects of grain growth on the observable data for any individual disk is a daunting task .",
    "one has to be concerned not only with the complicated growth and sedimentation processes @xcite , but also the structural , mineralogical , and dynamical properties of the aggregate solids ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "so , while we might not be able to determine with great certainty the magnitude of the effects of these processes on the inferred disk densities , the sense that they are underestimated is fairly certain .",
    "the prospects for significant improvements on basic disk structure measurements are excellent .",
    "the current suite of interferometers ( sma , pdbi , nma , vla ) operate in all of the major atmospheric windows beyond @xmath9450@xmath10 m with a typical spatial resolution of @xmath91  and the potential to improve up to a factor of @xmath93 higher . the carma interferometer will provide a substantial increase in sensitivity and resolution , where its kilometer - scale baseline lengths will allow direct probes of the density into the inner regions ( @xmath133au ) of nearby disks .",
    "we have briefly explored the potential advances in constraining the power - law index of the density distribution ( @xmath38 ) via modeling simulated flat disk data for various observational facilities . for a typical disk with @xmath134 and @xmath135au ,",
    "the standard setups for current interferometers can potentially measure @xmath38 to within roughly @xmath160.3@xmath130.4 ( e.g. , see the waoph 6 disk in figure [ data_models6 ] with the sma c2+e configuration ) .",
    "the accuracy of the constraint on @xmath38 basically increases linearly with the spatial resolution , indicating that kilometer - scale carma baselines should be capable of measuring @xmath38 to within @xmath160.1 .",
    "the added benefit of improved spatial resolution is the sensitivity to the density distribution on ever smaller spatial scales in the disk , probing into the region where giant planets are expected to form .",
    "the real key to realizing this potential lies primarily with the ability to make phase corrections on the longest baseline separations ( e.g. , using water - vapor radiometry ) .",
    "the promise of submillimeter data with higher sensitivity and resolution will also allow some of the restrictions in the modeling described here to be relaxed .",
    "the obvious goal will be to switch some of the fixed parameters into free ones ( for example , fitting for the disk geometry directly from the 2-d distribution of visibilities ) .",
    "of particular interest in this case is letting the power - law index of the opacity spectrum ( @xmath7 ) be a free parameter , rather than relying on the approximate correction to the observed sed slope discussed in  4.2 .",
    "ideally , this would be done in a direct way by adopting a model adjustment to simultaneously fit interferometric data at multiple wavelengths ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "almost all interferometers have a simultaneous dual - wavelength capability well - suited for this kind of analysis .",
    "we have used the sma interferometer to conduct a high spatial resolution submillimeter continuum survey of 24 circumstellar disks in the taurus - auriga and ophiuchus - scorpius star formation regions . by simultaneously fitting the broadband seds and submillimeter continuum visibilities to a simple disk model , we have placed constraints on the basic structural properties of these disks .",
    "we find :    1 .",
    "the radial distributions of temperature and density in these disks have been determined , assuming they follow single power - law behaviors . the median temperature and surface density profiles for the sample behave as @xmath136k and @xmath137 g @xmath76 , respectively , where @xmath132 is measured in au . however ,",
    "possible systematic errors and a more realistic temperature distribution in the outer disk indicate that the surface density probably has a steeper drop - off than is directly inferred here , with a typical power law index @xmath2 . the distribution of the outer radii measured for these disks peaks at @xmath138au .",
    "the inferred density distributions for these disks are consistent with similarity solutions for steady accretion disks , where the viscosity has a linear dependence on the radius and the @xmath113 parameter is roughly constant ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . a fiducial viscous evolution model with @xmath4 provides an excellent match to the variations of submillimeter flux densities , mass accretion rates , and outer radii with stellar age , as well as the typical sample sed and submillimeter surface brightness distribution .",
    "3 .   using the disk structure measurements and the shape of the submillimeter sed , we derive constraints on the power - law index of the opacity spectrum , @xmath7 . incorporating the appropriate corrections for optically thick emission ,",
    "the median value for this sample is @xmath6 .",
    "theoretical models suggest that such low values of @xmath7 indicate that solids in the disk have grown to roughly millimeter sizes .",
    "4 .   direct constraints on the likelihood of planet formation in these disks must await higher resolution observations .",
    "the density distributions inferred for the disks in this sample are significantly more shallow than those calculated for the mmsn / mmen and used in many planet formation models . extrapolating these distributions into the inner disk",
    "indicates that either too little material is available to form planets by the traditional mechanisms or , more likely , the adopted opacity prescription leads to significant density ( i.e. , mass ) underestimates .",
    "the literature sources of the continuum flux densities used to compile seds for this sample are given in table [ seds_table ] .",
    "some brief additional commentary for individual objects follows :    _ 04158 + 2805 _  this object has the optical / infrared scattered light pattern consistent with a high inclination disk , and is also seen as a large silhouette in the foreground of some nebulosity ( f. mnard , private communication ) .",

    "<S> we present a high spatial resolution submillimeter continuum survey of 24 circumstellar disks in the taurus - auriga and ophiuchus - scorpius star formation regions using the sma . in the context of a simple model , we use broadband spectral energy distributions and submillimeter visibilities to derive constraints on some basic parameters that describe the structure of these disks . for the typical disk in the sample </S>",
    "<S> we infer a radial surface density distribution @xmath0 with a median @xmath1 , although consideration of the systematic effects of some of our assumptions suggest that steeper distributions with @xmath2 are more reasonable . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of the outer radii of these disks shows a distinct peak at @xmath3au , with only a few cases where the disk emission is completely unresolved . </S>",
    "<S> based on these disk structure measurements , the mass accretion rates , and the typical spectral and spatial distributions of submillimeter emission , we show that the observations are in good agreement with similarity solutions for steady accretion disks that have a viscosity parameter @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we provide new estimates of the spectral dependence of the disk opacity @xmath5 with a median @xmath6 , corrected for optically thick emission . </S>",
    "<S> this typical value of @xmath7 is consistent with model predictions for the collisional growth of solids to millimeter size scales in the outer disk . although direct constraints on planet formation in these disks are not currently available , the extrapolated density distributions inferred here are substantially shallower than those calculated based on the solar system or extrasolar planets and typically used in planet formation models . </S>",
    "<S> it is possible that we are substantially underestimating disk densities due to an incomplete submillimeter opacity prescription . </S>"
