    "resistive plate chambers ( rpc ) are gaseous particle detectors widely used in many high energy physics experiments as they are affordable and yet efficient and reliable ( compared to scintillator - based detectors ) , both as timing or tracking charged - particle detector .",
    "a rpc is basically made of gaseous mixture contained between two plates of resistive materials ( typically bakelite or glass ) where a high - voltage is applied between them , typically from @xmath0 to @xmath1 kv .",
    "a charged particle going through the detector will ionise the gas , freeing one or more electrons .",
    "those freed electrons , under the influence of the electric field , will drift toward the anode and multiply by interactions with gas molecules and finally produce an electronic avalanche .",
    "typically rpcs are operated with a mixture of three gases : a ionising gas ( @xmath2 ) , an uv quencher gas ( @xmath3 ) which absorbs photons in order to avoid secondary avalanches , an electron quencher gas ( @xmath4 ) which absorbs a fraction of the electrons to contain the avalanche .",
    "we present results with the mixture used by calice sdhcal  @xcite : tfe @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) , @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) and @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "we use a common single - gap rpc geometry : the gas - gap is @xmath11 mm wide , the anode and cathode are respectively @xmath12 and @xmath13 mm thick with a dielectric constant of @xmath14 .",
    "when a charged particle traverses the detector it ionises the gas mixture in several zones , by emission of photo - electrons and auto - ionisation ( auger ) electrons .",
    "those zones then contain @xmath0 or more freed electrons which are called electron clusters .",
    "the energy deposit is then characterized by the number of clusters produced by unit of length as well as the probability distribution for the number of electrons per cluster . on average",
    "a minimum ionising muon produces about @xmath15 clusters by cm as shown by figure  [ fig : cldens ] .",
    "most of the time a cluster contains @xmath0 electron then the probability drops rapidly with the number of electrons and for instance , for @xmath16 gev / c muons , is below @xmath17 for more than @xmath18 electrons , as shown on figure  [ fig : clproba ] .",
    "those values are computed with the heed simulation program @xcite and are in good accordance with experimental results @xcite .",
    "the electrons freed during ionisation will then drift towards the anode under the influence of the electric field , and start an electronic avalanche by multiplying while interacting with gas molecules . in this section",
    "we briefly detail the riegler - lippmann - veenhof model for electronic avalanche @xcite which is a continuation of the legler model for avalanche in electro - negative gas  @xcite .",
    "the avalanche development is characterised by the townsend coefficient @xmath19 and the attachment coefficient @xmath20 .",
    "if an avalanche contains @xmath21 electrons at the position @xmath22 , the probability it contains @xmath23 at @xmath24 is given by @xmath25 . in the same way , the probability that one electron gets attached in an avalanche containing @xmath21 electrons is given by @xmath26 .",
    "then the average numbers of electrons @xmath27 and positive ions @xmath28 are modelised following @xcite @xmath29 with the initial condition @xmath30 and @xmath31 this yields @xmath32 in order to observe an electronic avalanche the exponential in eq .",
    "[ eq : nbar ] has to be positive .",
    "figure  [ fig : townsend ] shows both coefficients in function of the intensity of the electric field . in this case ,",
    "the electric field needs to be greater than @xmath33 kv / cm for an avalanche to develop .",
    "the evolution of the number of electrons in an avalanche is modelised following @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a random number @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "[ eq : n ] is valid only for @xmath38 , details for the other cases are in @xcite . in order to calculate the induced signal",
    "we ca nt use the probability distribution to approximate the final avalanche charge , instead we have to simulate the actual avalanche development .",
    "the gas gap is divided in @xmath39 steps of @xmath40 . in the case",
    "we have @xmath41 electron at the position @xmath42 , we ll find @xmath43 electrons at the position @xmath44 according to eq .",
    "[ eq : n ] .",
    "meaning that we loop over the @xmath41 electrons , draw a number from eq .",
    "[ eq : n ] and sum them . in the same way the @xmath43 electrons will multiply and we ll have @xmath45 electrons at @xmath46 .",
    "this procedure is iterated until all the electrons have reached the anode .",
    "the figure  [ fig : mult ] shows the simulation of three avalanches started by one electron at the cathode .",
    "the first interactions at beginning of the avalanches has an important influence for their development , and they quickly behave like an positive exponential just like the average number of electrons @xmath47 given by eq .",
    "[ eq : nbar ] .",
    "it is also important to note that an avalanche is not only driven by @xmath48 , but also by @xmath19 and @xmath20 themselves as pointed out in  @xcite .",
    "when no electric field is present , an electron cloud in a gas is subject to the classic thermal diffusion .",
    "but when an electric field is applied the thermal diffusion motion is superposed by a drift motion . at the microscopic scale",
    "an electron drifting the distance @xmath49 gains the energy @xmath50 between two collisions , where @xmath51 is the intensity of the field and @xmath52 the unit charge . some of this energy will be lost during the next encounter with a gas molecule ( non - ionising elastic collision ) .",
    "then the electron is again accelerated by the electron field and lost some when colliding , and so on . at a macroscopic scale",
    "one sees the electron moving with a constant drift velocity which depends on the gas and the electric field applied @xcite .    because of this constant drift motion superposed to the thermal diffusion motion , the diffusion becomes anisotropic .",
    "we can separate it in two distinct terms , a longitudinal one and a transverse one  @xcite @xmath53 we used cylindrical coordinate and rotational symmetry ( a @xmath54-integration was carried out leading to an additional factor of @xmath55 ) .",
    "the width of the gaussian depends on the longitudinal and transverse diffusion coefficients @xmath56 @xmath57 $ ] and the drifted distance @xmath58 : @xmath59 .",
    "figure  [ fig : diff ] shows the dependence of the diffusion coefficient on the electric field .    in the simulation",
    "the longitudinal diffusion is fully modelised : the electrons are redistributed at each simulation step where the new @xmath60-coordinate is computed by drawing a random number from eq .",
    "[ eq : diffl ] , where @xmath61 and @xmath62 is the detector step which is the distance drifted by the electrons between two simulation steps .",
    "however the transverse diffusion is only approximate as the avalanche is modelised in @xmath0-dimension .",
    "we suppose the electrons are contained in a disc perpendicular to the @xmath60-axis with a radial charge distribution following eq .",
    "[ eq : difft ] with @xmath63 with @xmath58 the distance drifted by the electrons from their position of generation .",
    "this section briefly details the space charge effect in an rpc .",
    "the general solution is detailed in  @xcite and a description of this effect in rpc can be found in  @xcite .",
    "when the number of charges in the avalanche becomes high enough they influence the electric field , and so influence the values of the townsend and attachment coefficient @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "this is the space charge effect .",
    "we need to compute the contribution to the electric field of all the charges present in the avalanche .",
    "the analytic formula for the potential @xmath64 of a point charge in an infinite plane condenser of three layers is detailed in @xcite .",
    "@xmath65 is the point of observation and @xmath66 is the position of the charge .",
    "since the simulation is in @xmath0-dimension it is sufficient to compute @xmath67 = @xmath68 . as we only approximate the transverse diffusion where we consider a unit charge at position @xmath69 is contained in a disk perpendicular to the @xmath60-axis , the electric field of this disk",
    "is given by  @xcite @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the radial charge distribution of the disk ( eq .",
    "[ eq : difft ] ) . the total field from the space charges",
    "is then computed by summing over the disk at each detector bin : @xmath72 where @xmath73 is total charge in bin @xmath21 .      in order to compute the induced current we make use of the ramo s theorem generalised to resistive materials @xcite @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the number of electrons in the detector at time @xmath76 , @xmath77 is the relative dielectric constant of the resistive layers , @xmath78 and @xmath79 are respectively the width of the gas gap and of the resistive layers .",
    "@xmath80 is the electron drift velocity , it depends on the gas mixture as well as the electric field .",
    "it is shown on figure  [ fig : driftv ] as a function of the field intensity .",
    "the charges induced over time is shown on figure  [ fig : inducedcharges ] .",
    "one can note a clear saturation effect at about time step @xmath81 , due to the space charge effect as the number of charges became high enough to lower the applied field and thus the multiplication gain .",
    "figure  [ fig : eff ] is a simulated efficiency curve along with the time - resolution .",
    "the efficiency is the ratio of the number of avalanches that has crossed the detection threshold ( set to @xmath82 fc ) to the total number of avalanches simulated .",
    "the time - resolution is taken as the standard - deviation from the threshold - crossing time distribution , i.e. the time when the induced charge has crossed the detection threshold .",
    "for the rpc configuration we considered in the simulation , at its operation point of @xmath83 kv , the experimental efficiency is about @xmath84 with a typical time resolution around @xmath85 ps  @xcite which are in good accordance with figure  [ fig : eff ] .",
    "we have briefly detailed the main physical processes having an important impact for the electronic avalanches occurring in a rpc , through the riegler - lippmann - veenhof model .",
    "the results produced by the simulation show good behavior but could be compared to experimental data from test beam . in this so - called 1.5d model ,",
    "the transverse diffusion is only approximated while a full @xmath86-dimensional simulation would be , rationally , more accurate but also much slower .",
    "this model calls for a lot of matrix algebra , thus taking advantage of the computing power of gpus for this matter could provide a non - negligible speed - up ."
