    "neutron - rich nuclei in the mass region @xmath1 have attracted considerable attention from both theoretical and experimental sides in the last decades .",
    "they are interesting in many respects .",
    "first , the mass region is characterized by rapid structural changes in the ground state and low - lying collective excited states ( see e.g. @xcite for a general review ) .",
    "relativistic @xcite and nonrelativistic @xcite studies of the nuclear structural evolution in this mass region show that the equilibrium shape of the nucleus changes rapidly with the number of nucleons and shape coexistence is present with competing spherical , axially symmetric prolate and oblate , as well as triaxial shapes at close energies .",
    "these features are supported by spectroscopic observations @xcite including @xmath2 lifetime measurements @xcite and quadrupole moments for rotational bands @xcite , as well as by laser spectroscopy measurements on zr @xcite and mo @xcite isotopes .",
    "in addition , this mass region is also involved in the astrophysical rapid neutron capture process ( r process ) .",
    "the r process is considered to be one of the main nucleosynthesis mechanisms leading to the production of heavy neutron - rich nuclei and for the existence of about half of the nuclei heavier than iron @xcite .",
    "the r - process nucleosynthesis involves many neutron - rich unstable isotopes , whose masses and @xmath0-decay properties , including @xmath0-decay half - lives ( @xmath3 ) and @xmath0-delayed neutron - emission probabilities ( @xmath4 ) , are crucial quantities to understand the possible r - process paths , the isotopic abundances , and the time scales of the process @xcite .",
    "although much progress is being done recently on masses ( see for example the jyvskyl mass database @xcite ) and half - lives @xcite measurements , unfortunately most of the nuclear properties of relevance for the r process are experimentally unknown due to their extremely low production yields in the laboratory .",
    "therefore , reliable nuclear physics models are needed to interpret the astrophysical observations and to model and simulate properly the r process . for example , the agreement with the observed r - process abundances in this mass region is manifestly improved @xcite when using nuclear structure models that include a shell quenching effect at @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the quasiparticle random - phase approximation ( qrpa ) has been shown to be a suitable model to deal with medium - mass open - shell nuclei .",
    "qrpa calculations for neutron - rich nuclei have been performed within different approaches , such as spherical formalisms based on hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) mean field @xcite , on continuum spherical qrpa with density functionals @xcite , and on relativistic mean field approaches @xcite .",
    "however , the mass region of concern here requires nuclear deformation as a relevant degree of freedom to characterize the nuclear structure involved in the calculation of the @xmath0-strength functions .",
    "the deformed qrpa formalism was developed in refs .",
    "@xcite , where phenomenological mean fields based on nilsson or woods - saxon potentials were used as a starting basis . a tamm - dancoff approximation with sk3 interaction",
    "was also implemented in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this work",
    "we investigate the decay properties of both even and odd neutron - rich zr and mo isotopes within a deformed proton - neutron qrpa based on a self - consistent hartree - fock ( hf ) mean field formalism with skyrme interactions and pairing correlations in bcs approximation .",
    "residual spin - isospin interactions are also included in the particle - hole and particle - particle channels @xcite .",
    "this work was started in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the @xmath0-decay properties of the even - even isotopes @xmath6zr and @xmath7mo were studied . in the present work",
    "we extend that study in several aspects .",
    "first , we repeat the calculations of @xmath3 and @xmath4 for the same isotopes , but using new or updated measurements for the @xmath8 and @xmath9 values @xcite .",
    "second , we extend the calculations to include odd-@xmath10 isotopes , as well as more exotic isotopes , namely @xmath11zr and @xmath12mo .",
    "this study is justified by a renewed experimental interest to measure the half - lives of heavier and more exotic nuclei in this mass region at riken .",
    "this study will contribute with theoretical support to the understanding of these future measurements .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we present a review of the theoretical formalism used .",
    "[ results ] contains the results obtained for the potential energy curves ( pec ) , gamow - teller ( gt ) strength distributions , @xmath0-decay half - lives , and @xmath0-delayed neutron - emission probabilities .",
    "iv summarizes the main conclusions .",
    "in this section we show briefly the theoretical framework used in this paper to describe the @xmath0-decay properties in zr and mo neutron - rich isotopes .",
    "more details of the formalism can be found in refs .",
    "the method consists of a self - consistent formalism based on a deformed hartree - fock mean field obtained with skyrme interactions including pairing correlations .",
    "the single - particle energies , wave functions , and occupation probabilities are generated from this mean field . in this work",
    "we have chosen the skyrme force sly4 @xcite as a representative of the skyrme forces .",
    "the protocol to derive this interaction includes information on the equation of state of pure neutron matter obtained from realistic forces that produce better isotopic properties .",
    "sly4 is one of the more successful skyrme forces and has been extensively studied in the last years @xcite .",
    "the solution of the hf equation is found by using the formalism developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , assuming time reversal and axial symmetry .",
    "the single - particle wave functions are expanded in terms of the eigenstates of an axially symmetric harmonic oscillator in cylindrical coordinates , using twelve major shells .",
    "the method also includes pairing between like nucleons in bcs approximation with fixed gap parameters for protons and neutrons , which are determined phenomenologically from the odd - even mass differences through a symmetric five term formula involving the experimental binding energies @xcite when available . in those cases where experimental information for masses is still not available ,",
    "we have used the same pairing gaps as the closer isotopes measured .",
    "the pairing gaps for protons ( @xmath13 ) and neutrons ( @xmath14 ) obtained in this way are roughly around 1 mev .",
    "the pecs are analyzed as a function of the quadrupole deformation parameter @xmath0 . for that purpose , constrained hf calculations are performed with a quadratic constraint @xcite .",
    "the hf energy is minimized under the constraint of keeping fixed the nuclear deformation .",
    "calculations for gt strengths are performed subsequently for the equilibrium shapes of each nucleus , that is , for the solutions , in general deformed , for which minima are obtained in the energy curves . since decays connecting different shapes are disfavored , similar shapes are assumed for the ground state of the parent nucleus and for all populated states in the daughter nucleus .",
    "the validity of this assumption was discussed for example in refs .",
    "@xcite .    to describe gt transitions ,",
    "a spin - isospin residual interaction is added to the mean field and treated in a deformed proton - neutron qrpa @xcite .",
    "this interaction contains two parts , particle - hole ( @xmath15 ) and particle - particle ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the interaction in the @xmath15 channel is responsible for the position and structure of the gt resonance @xcite and it can be derived consistently from the same skyrme interaction used to generate the mean field , through the second derivatives of the energy density functional with respect to the one - body densities .",
    "the @xmath15 residual interaction is finally expressed in a separable form by averaging the landau - migdal resulting force over the nuclear volume , as explained in refs .",
    "@xcite . by taking separable gt forces , the energy eigenvalue problem reduces to find the roots of an algebraic equation .",
    "the @xmath16 component is a neutron - proton pairing force in the @xmath17 coupling channel , which is also introduced as a separable force @xcite .",
    "this strength is usually fitted to reproduce globally the experimental half - lives .",
    "various attempts have been done in the past to fix this strength @xcite , arriving to expressions that depend on the model used to describe the mean field , nilsson model in the above reference .    in previous works",
    "@xcite we studied the sensitivity of the gt strength distributions to the various ingredients contributing to the deformed qrpa calculations , namely to the nucleon - nucleon effective force , to pairing correlations , and to residual interactions .",
    "we found different sensitivities to them . in this work ,",
    "all of these ingredients have been fixed to the most reasonable choices found previously .",
    "in particular we use the coupling strengths @xmath18 mev and @xmath19 mev for the @xmath15 and @xmath16 channels , respectively .    the technical details to solve the qrpa equations have been described in refs . @xcite . here",
    "we only mention that , because of the use of separable residual forces , the solutions of the qrpa equations are found by solving first a dispersion relation , which is an algebraic equation of fourth order in the excitation energy @xmath20",
    ". then , for each value of the energy , the gt transition amplitudes in the intrinsic frame connecting the ground state @xmath21 of an even - even nucleus to one phonon states in the daughter nucleus @xmath22 are found to be    @xmath23    where @xmath24 and @xmath25 with @xmath26 in terms of the occupation amplitudes for neutrons and protons @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) and the matrix elements of the spin operator , @xmath29 , connecting proton and neutron single - particle states , as they come out from the hf+bcs calculation . @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the forward and backward amplitudes of the qrpa phonon operator , respectively .    once the intrinsic amplitudes in eq .",

    "have been expressed in terms of the intrinsic states using the bohr - mottelson factorization @xcite .",
    "when the parent nucleus has an odd nucleon , the ground state can be expressed as a one - quasiparticle ( 1qp ) state in which the odd nucleon occupies the single - particle orbit of lowest energy .",
    "then two types of transitions are possible .",
    "one type is due to phonon excitations in which the odd nucleon acts only as a spectator .",
    "these are three - quasiparticle ( 3qp ) states . in the intrinsic frame ,",
    "the transition amplitudes are in this case basically the same as in the even - even case in eq .",
    "( [ intrinsic ] ) , but with the blocked spectator excluded from the calculation .",
    "the other type of transitions are those involving the odd nucleon state ( 1qp ) , which are treated by taking into account phonon correlations in the quasiparticle transitions in first - order perturbation .",
    "the transition amplitudes for the correlated states can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "concerning the excitation energy of the daughter nuclei to which we refer all the gt strength distributions in this paper , we have to distinguish again between the case of even - even and odd-@xmath10 parents . in the case of even - even systems , the excitation energy of the 2qp states is simply given by    @xmath36}=\\omega -e_{\\pi_0 } - e_{\\nu_0 } \\",

    "the excitation energies for 1qp transitions are    @xmath39}=e_\\pi - e_{\\pi_0 } \\ , .",

    "\\label{eex3qp}\\ ] ]    this implies that the lowest excitation energy of 3qp type is of the order of twice the neutron pairing gap .",
    "therefore , all the strength contained in the low - excitation - energy region below typically 2 - 3 mev in the odd - a nuclei studied in this paper , corresponds to 1qp transitions .",
    "the @xmath0-decay half - life is obtained by summing all the allowed transition strengths to states in the daughter nucleus with excitation energies lying below the corresponding @xmath41-energy , @xmath42 , written in terms of the nuclear masses @xmath43 and the electron mass ( @xmath44 ) , and weighted with the phase space factors @xmath45 ,    @xmath46    with @xmath47  s and @xmath48 , where 0.77 is a standard quenching factor .",

    "this information is only available for the isotopes @xmath121zr and @xmath122mo , although the values beyond @xmath80zr and @xmath87mo are evaluated from systematics .",
    "these values are compared with the predictions of the two mass models mentioned above . in the lower panels we have the neutron separation energies",
    "@xmath9 corresponding to the daughter isotopes of zr and mo , nb ( c ) and tc ( d ) , respectively . in this case",
    "the energies beyond @xmath87nb and @xmath123tc are not directly measured , but deduced from systematics . in",
    "what follows the results for @xmath3 and @xmath4 will be calculated by using experimental @xmath8 and @xmath9 values when available , and values from sly4 and dz-28 in other cases .    in figs",
    "[ fig_t_zr_1 ] and [ fig_t_mo_1 ] we compare the measured @xmath0-decay half - lives with the theoretical results obtained with the prolate , oblate , and spherical equilibrium shapes , for zr and mo isotopes , respectively .",
    "three regions can be distinguished in these figures . a first region ( i ) with solid symbols for prolate , oblate , and spherical shapes , where experimental @xmath8 values are used , @xmath124zr and @xmath125mo . a second region ( ii ) with open symbols that correspond to @xmath126zr and @xmath127mo , where we use @xmath8 values extracted from systematics , from sly4 and from dz-28 , and a third region ( iii ) , @xmath128zr and @xmath129mo , where only calculated @xmath8 values",
    "are used .    in the first region ( i ) of both figures ,",
    "the half - lives from prolate shapes are always larger than those from oblate shapes and both of them are larger than the half - lives from spherical nuclei .",
    "this feature can be easily understood from figs .",
    "[ fig_bgt_zr_qbeta]-[fig_bgt_mo_qbeta ] , where we can see how the gt strength contained in the energy region below @xmath8 is much lower in the prolate case than in the oblate and spherical cases .",
    "comparison with the experiment in this region indicates that the trend observed in zr isotopes is nicely reproduced by the prolate shapes with a tendency to overestimate the half - lives . in this region",
    "an oblate component that produces smaller half - lives would help in the agreement with experiment . in the case of the lighter mo isotopes in region ( i )",
    "the prolate shapes overestimate clearly the measured half - lives , while the oblate shapes underestimate them . a shape coexistence in lighter mo isotopes",
    "would produce in this case a better agreement with experiment .",
    "in the middle region ( ii ) we can see that the spread of the results due to the nuclear deformation is comparable with the spread due to the uncertainty in the @xmath8 value .",
    "nevertheless , we can still perceive the tendency of the prolate ( spherical ) shapes to overestimate ( underestimate ) the half - lives with results from oblate shapes somewhat in between .",
    "one should also keep in mind that the experimental half - lives for @xmath130zr and for @xmath131mo are not properly measured values but extracted from systematics . in the third region ( iii ) of heavier isotopes we obtain spherical or close to sphericity shapes .",
    "the predicted half - lives corresponding to these shapes are relatively large and almost flat .",
    "this tendency seems to be at variance with the tendency shown by the experimental half - lives extracted from systematics that continue decreasing .",
    "measurements in this region will be crucial to determine whether isotopes in this mass region become spherical as we approach the magic neutron number .    in the next two figures we simplify the comparison of various calculations for the half - lives by showing only the most relevant ones .",
    "thus , in figs . [ fig_t_zr_2 ] and [ fig_t_mo_2 ] we compare the measured @xmath0-decay half - lives with the calculations corresponding only to the ground states of the isotopes . for zr isotopes in fig .",
    "[ fig_t_zr_2 ] we plot half - lives for prolate shapes for @xmath121zr and for spherical shapes for @xmath128zr .",
    "similarly , for mo isotopes in fig . [ fig_t_mo_2 ] we plot half - lives for prolate shapes for @xmath132mo , for oblate shapes for @xmath133mo , and for spherical shapes for @xmath129mo . similar to the previous figures , one can also distinguish three regions according to the @xmath8 values used . in fig .",
    "[ fig_t_zr_2 ] for zr isotopes we see again how the prolate ground state shapes describe well the pattern of the half - lives .",
    "nevertheless the agreement can be improved by reducing somewhat the half - lives of the lighter isotopes with an oblate component predicted by the calculations . in the middle region ,",
    "the experimental pattern is reasonably well reproduced by the calculations , but the sly4 masses reproduce better the measured half - lives . finally for the heavier isotopes the predicted half - lives corresponding to spherical nuclei are almost flat . in fig .",
    "[ fig_t_mo_2 ] for mo isotopes , a shape coexistence of the prolate ground state shape with the excited oblate shape in the lighter mo isotopes would produce in a better agreement with experiment . in the middle region ,",
    "the oblate shapes reproduce quite satisfactorily the measurements and no big differences are found between the half - lives obtained by using sly4 or experimental @xmath8 values . as in the case of zr isotopes ,",
    "the heavier spherical mo isotopes predict relatively large half - lives that seems to deviate from the decreasing exhibit by the experimental values from systematics .",
    "our results for the half - lives and gt strength distributions in zr isotopes agree well with the calculations by yoshida @xcite , where similar results are presented for even - even zr isotopes within a self - consistent qrpa with skyrme interactions , using only the strengths of the pairing interaction as extra parameters and a constant strength for the residual @xmath134 pairing interaction , which is fitted to reproduce the half - life of @xmath135zr .",
    "our results agree also qualitatively with those in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath3 and @xmath4 in zr and mo isotopes , where qrpa calculations are performed using deformed woods - saxon potentials and realistic cd - bonn residual forces .",
    "first - forbidden transitions were also considered in @xcite , although it was found on the basis of the branching ratio for the forbidden decays that in this mass region their effect can be neglected .    in the next figures ( figs .",
    "[ fig_pn_zr_1]-[fig_pn_mo_2 ] ) , we show the same type of information as in figs .",
    "[ fig_t_zr_1]-[fig_t_mo_2 ] , but for the @xmath0-delayed neutron - emission probabilities @xmath4 , expressed as a percentage .",
    "experimental @xmath4 values @xcite are only upper limits except for the cases @xmath136mo . in all cases",
    "the calculations underestimate the existing measurements .",
    "this means that in the range of isotopes where these measurements exist , the relative gt strength contained in the energy region below ( above ) @xmath9 is overestimated ( underestimated ) theoretically .",
    "the general isotopic trend observed is an increase of @xmath4 with @xmath10 , obviously related to the decrease of @xmath9 as we approach the neutron drip line .",
    "the behavior of @xmath4 for spherical shapes is somewhat special .",
    "it appears clearly below the deformed cases up to @xmath137 ( @xmath138 ) in zr ( mo ) isotopes , and then suddenly it increases up to practically @xmath139 in the heavier isotopes . the origin of this behavior can be traced back to the profile of the accumulated strength distributions in spherical nuclei showing a sharp increase in figs .",
    "[ fig_bgt_zr]-[fig_bgt_mo ] at variance with the smooth distribution of the deformed cases denoting the high fragmentation of the strength .",
    "it is also worth mentioning the extreme sensitivity of @xmath4 to @xmath9 in the case of spherical nuclei .",
    "since most of the strength in spherical nuclei is very localized in energy , @xmath4 can change drastically if this strength is located a little bit above or a little bit below @xmath9 .",
    "thus , we can see for example how @xmath4 in @xmath140zr changes from @xmath141 to @xmath142 when we use @xmath9 from dz-28 ( dotted lines ) or from sly4 ( dashed lines ) .",
    "the @xmath9 values for @xmath140nb change from 2.92 mev with sly4 to 3.31 mev for dz-28 ( fig.[fig_qbeta_sn_red](c ) ) , values that are respectively below and above the energy where the gt strength peaks in @xmath140zr ( fig.[fig_bgt_zr_qbeta ] ) .",
    "similarly , the sharp change in @xmath4 between spherical @xmath140zr and @xmath123zr isotopes is related to the relative position of the strength with respect to @xmath9 , which appears below @xmath9 in @xmath140zr and above it in @xmath123zr ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_bgt_zr_qbeta ] ) .",
    "similar general comments are valid for mo isotopes . in this case",
    "particular behaviors in the spherical case can be understood as well by means of the interplay between @xmath9 values and the energies where the gt strength is peaked .",
    "this is the case of @xmath143mo , where the low @xmath4 value found for dz-28 is correlated to the high value of @xmath9 in fig . [",
    "fig_qbeta_sn_red](d ) .",
    "this is also the case of @xmath144mo , where the low @xmath4 value for sly4 is due to the large value of @xmath9 .",
    "we can also mention the strange behavior of @xmath145mo in the prolate cases that decrease suddenly up to values similar to the spherical ones .",
    "this is related to the fact that the prolate deformation in this isotope has collapsed almost to a spherical shape as it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_beta ] .",
    "finally , we can see in figs .",
    "[ fig_pn_zr_2]- [ fig_pn_mo_2 ] the percentage @xmath4 values , but showing only the most relevant information that considers only the ground state shapes , as it has been done in figs .",
    "[ fig_t_zr_2]- [ fig_t_mo_2 ] . the general behavior discussed above",
    "can be seen more clearly in these simplified plots with increasing values for heavier isotopes that saturates to a @xmath142 value when the spherical shape becomes the ground state in the heavier isotopes with the particularity in the case of @xmath144mo discussed above .",
    "a microscopic nuclear approach based on a deformed qrpa calculation on top of a self - consistent mean field obtained with the sly4 skyrme interaction has been used to study the decay properties of neutron - rich zr and mo isotopes . the nuclear model and interaction",
    "have been successfully tested in the past providing good agreement with the available experimental information on bulk properties all along the nuclear chart .",
    "decay properties in other mass regions have been well reproduced as well . in this work",
    "we have studied even and odd isotopes , encompassing the whole isotopic chains @xmath146zr and @xmath147mo .",
    "the structural evolution in these isotopes has been studied from their pecs .",
    "we have found competing oblate and prolate shapes in the lighter isotopes and spherical shapes becoming ground states in the heavier .",
    "then , gamow - teller strength distributions , @xmath0-decay half - lives , and @xmath0-delayed neutron emission probabilities corresponding to the equilibrium shapes of the respective isotopes have been computed .",
    "the isotopic evolution of the gt strength distributions exhibit some typical features , such as the gt resonances that increase in energy and strength as the number of neutrons increase .",
    "effects of deformation are hard to see on a global scale , but they become apparent in the low excitation energy below @xmath8 energies , a region that determines the half - lives .",
    "half - lives have been calculated with experimental values of @xmath8 when available and with values extracted from mass models otherwise .",
    "the spread of the results due to the nuclear shape and to the lack of knowledge of @xmath8 is comparable .",
    "thus , it is very important to continue measuring the masses of exotic nuclei to avoid these type of uncertainties .",
    "the half - lives are in general well described in the lighter and medium isotopes by using the ground state shapes , although they would improve a bit with some admixtures of the isomeric shapes . in this region ,",
    "the half - lives obtained with spherical shapes are clearly below the experiment and the results from deformed shapes . for heavier isotopes where the half - lives have not been measured yet ,",
    "the calculations predict a rather flat behavior corresponding to spherical ground states .",
    "@xmath4 values are not well reproduced .",
    "the calculations underestimate them although only upper limits are measured in most cases .",
    "nevertheless , the general trend observed is followed when using deformed shapes , whereas spherical shapes produce extremely low @xmath4 values .",
    "the scenario changes suddenly in the heavier isotopes , where spherical shapes produce @xmath4 values of @xmath142 .",
    "thus , experimental information on the energy distribution of the gt strength is a valuable piece of knowledge about nuclear structure in this mass region .",
    "this is within the present perspectives in the case of the lighter isotopes considered in this work .",
    "similarly , measuring the half - lives of the heavier isotopes will be highly beneficial to model reliably the r process and to constrain theoretical nuclear models .",
