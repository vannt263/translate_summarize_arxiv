    "one exemplary phenomenon , which is key towards the understanding of metal - insulator- and superconductor - insulator transitions are current jumps in the current - voltage characteristics at some threshold voltage.@xcite the mechanism of the jumps that mark an abrupt transition from a high - resistance insulating to a low - resistance metallic state is thought to be an overheating of the electronic system.@xcite however , a standard overheating description based solely on the averaged macroscopic material characteristics@xcite can not explain the behavior of the observed current - voltage characteristics.@xcite it has been long known@xcite that in an inhomogeneous material the current and power loss densities may have strong spatial variations and that areas with enhanced joule heat dissipation , as compared to their neighboring vicinity , appear .",
    "these areas are called _ hotspots _ and may play the role of nuclei triggering heat instabilities and current jumps . a similar effect",
    "is known in vortex physics , where it was demonstrated that hotspots can cause vortex flow instabilities and corresponding voltage jumps.@xcite this indicates that the threshold electric properties of a two - phase medium can be dominated by statistically rare events of forming hotspots due to inherent inhomogeneity rather than average behavior and calls for a thorough study of this phenomenon .",
    "it has already been known that at the onset of mit , the currents are concentrated along quasi - one - dimensional percolation - type optimal paths.@xcite this stimulated extensive studies of statistical properties of optimal paths and the corresponding distribution of large currents.@xcite however , properties and distribution of hot spots remain almost unexplored .",
