    "our previous investigation of the @xmath7 and @xmath8 configuration metastable levels @xcite has revealed that the ions of the rhodium isoelectronic sequence have large number of metastable levels with comparatively large radiative lifetimes .",
    "therefore , there is an evident need for a more detailed study .",
    "the relevance and significance of the magnetic quadrupole ( @xmath5 ) and electric octupole ( @xmath6 ) transitions for such metastable levels has been quite comprehensively described in @xcite . that investigation of the significance of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 transitions involved large number of atoms of different ionization stages , therefore the calculations were performed without inclusion of correlation corrections .",
    "metastable levels , which do not have the electric dipole decay channels , are essential in study of both astrophysical and laboratory plasmas @xcite or in analysis of experimental spectra of various ions @xcite , including very important tungsten ions ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "as it was concluded in @xcite , the parameters of high multipole order radiative transitions and the radiative lifetimes of metastable levels were `` essential building blocks in radiative - collisional models simulating spectra '' .",
    "traditionally , the radiative lifetimes for the excited metastable levels of the ground configuration are determined from the calculated electric quadrupole ( @xmath9 ) and magnetic dipole ( @xmath10 ) transition probabilities , see @xcite .",
    "these types of radiative transitions also can be important when the radiative lifetimes of the levels of excited configurations are calculated @xcite .",
    "very recently the multiconfiguration dirac - hartree - fock approach was applied to determine the @xmath11 , @xmath10 , @xmath9 , and @xmath5 transition parameters for the ions up to @xmath12 ( see @xcite and the references therein ) .    many of the excited opposite - parity configuration levels are metastable ones due to a limited number of the @xmath11-decay channels when the ground configuration has just few levels . in such a situation ,",
    "the @xmath6 and @xmath5 radiative transitions become important decay channels - although those transitions traditionally are considered as weak and insignificant for the calculated radiative lifetimes @xcite .",
    "the relativistic many - body perturbation theory was employed to investigate the fe@xmath13 ion properties in @xcite . there",
    "the details describing the rise and decay of metastable levels are given and discussed .",
    "transitions originating from the w@xmath14 ion metastable levels were observed in ebit experiment @xcite .",
    "it was concluded after additional relativistic many - body perturbation theory ( rmbpt ) calculations that some of the excited configuration @xmath15 levels have `` extremely long lifetimes '' .",
    "the radiative transitions in ni - like ions from @xmath16 to @xmath17 were studied in @xcite using rmbpt which includes the breit interaction .    in our earlier work @xcite we have demonstrated that the metastable levels of the excited configurations also exist for the ions other than ni - like @xcite or pd - like ions @xcite that have all closed shells in the ground configurations .",
    "similar metastable levels can exist in the ions with the ground configurations , which have open 4d shells , e.g. , in the rh - like ions with the ground configuration @xmath18 .",
    "unfortunately , to our best knowledge , there are no theoretical or experimental works investigating the metastable level properties of those ions .",
    "the aim of the present work is to demonstrate how the correlation corrections can change calculated radiative lifetimes of the metastable levels .",
    "another issue , which has emerged during our previous investigation , is the location of the @xmath19 and other excited configurations .",
    "the location in the energy spectrum of the excited configurations is important as the additional decay channels can emerge for some levels of the configuration @xmath1 .",
    "traditionally , the levels are considered as the metastable ones when the electric dipole ( @xmath11 ) transitions from these levels are forbidden by the selection rules for the total orbital quantum number @xmath20 .",
    "the metastable levels have two important channels of the radiative decay .",
    "one channel is comprised from the magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole transitions to the levels of the same parity , usually to the levels of the same configuration ; nevertheless , the transitions among the levels of different configurations with the same parity are also allowed .",
    "the second channel constitutes the magnetic quadrupole and electric octupole transitions to the levels of the different - parity configurations .",
    "the strongest radiative transitions are those connecting the excited configuration levels to the ground configuration levels .",
    "nevertheless , some radiative transitions connecting the levels of opposite - parity excited configurations also can be relatively strong and significant in the calculation of radiative lifetimes .",
    "the object of the present investigation is the configuration @xmath1 levels with high values of the total angular momentum @xmath20 fand their possible decay channels .",
    "we demonstrate how their relative positions in the energy spectra and their radiative properties change along the rhodium isoelectronic sequence .",
    "the calculations were performed in the quasirelativistic ( qr ) hartree - fock approximation @xcite , using several different configuration interaction ( ci ) expansion sets . as the first step",
    ", the energy spectra were calculated for the ions from @xmath21 to @xmath4 adopting a small ci expansion , which consisted of few configurations for each parity . in this particular approximation",
    "( further we call it ci1 ) , all electrons , both from configurations under study and the admixed ones , were described purely by solutions of the quasirelativistic equations @xcite .",
    "after the results of the energy spectra were analyzed , the subsequent investigation of the rhodium - like ions was limited to the ions starting from @xmath3 .",
    "further , at the second step , the correlation corrections were included using the extensive ci wavefunction expansion . in this case , the electrons of the admixed configurations were described by the solutions of the quasirelativistic equations and by the quasirelativistic transformed radial orbitals @xcite .",
    "we use the quasirelativistic hartree - fock approximation in our _ ab initio _ calculation of the ion level energies and radiative transition parameters , such as the line strengths @xmath22 , weighted oscillator strengths @xmath23 , radiative transition probabilities @xmath24 .",
    "the quasirelativistic calculations are performed in a way described in our previous studies @xcite . at the start ,",
    "the qr equations for the ground configuration @xmath0 are solved .",
    "then the qr equations for the @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( up to @xmath27 ) radial orbitals ( ro ) are solved in a frozen - core potential .",
    "the relativistic corrections are included in the breit - pauli approach specially adopted for the quasirelativistic radial orbitals @xcite .",
    "we employ the same ro basis both for the even and odd configurations .",
    "the correlation corrections are included by applying the ci method . in our basic approach , called ci1 , the ci includes only the configurations under research .",
    "the even configurations @xmath0 , @xmath19 and @xmath28 and the odd ones @xmath2 , @xmath29 and @xmath1 make the smallest ci expansion sets used in the calculations .",
    "no admixed configurations are included in this approach .",
    "the results obtained in this approach ( ci1 ) are used for the rough evaluation of the energy spectra of the configurations under investigation and the radiative transitions of different multipole orders .",
    "the subsequent ci expansion is formed from the set of the admixed configurations generated by virtually exciting one or two electrons from the @xmath30 and @xmath26 shells of the adjusted configurations .",
    "the virtually excited electrons up to @xmath27 in the admixed configurations are described by the quasirelativistic ro .",
    "although this ro basis is rather limited , the total amount of the admixed configurations , which can interact with the adjusted ground configuration , reaches 72 for @xmath3 . for the complex of the odd configurations @xmath2 and @xmath1",
    ", the number of possible admixed configurations adds to 146 .",
    "the strongly interacting configurations are selected by selection methods @xcite applied in all our previously described calculations .",
    "the selection criterion @xcite is @xmath31 .",
    "this means that all configurations with the mean weight larger than @xmath32 are included into the ci expansion .",
    "there are 40 admixed even configurations and 31 odd one after the selection rules are applied for the ion @xmath3 .",
    "the admixed configurations produce very large amount of configuration state functions ( csf ) .",
    "this number is reduced by applying the csf reduction methods described in @xcite .    for each ion in the isoelectronic sequence ,",
    "its own quasirelativistic ro basis is determined , the list of admixed configurations is generated by the same virtual excitations , and the admixed configurations are selected using the same criterion . therefore the ci expansion differs for each particular ion and the number of admixed configurations decreases with increasing nuclear charge @xmath33 . for @xmath4 ,",
    "the ci expansion is significantly smaller , and only 28 even configurations and 22 odd ones are selected .",
    "the results obtained by such a way are labeled as ci2 .    in order to perform more accurate and reliable calculations in the multiconfiguration approximation ,",
    "the basis of determined quasirelativistic ro is supplemented with the transformed radial orbitals ( tro ) described by variable parameters @xcite .",
    "the tro are determined for the radial orbitals having the principal quantum number @xmath34 and for all possible values of the orbital quantum number @xmath35 , i.e. @xmath36 . the admixed configurations are generated by virtually exciting one or two electrons from the @xmath30 and @xmath26 shells of the adjusted configurations .",
    "the virtually excited electrons are described by the quasirelativistic ro ( @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) and by the quasirelativistic tro for the remaining virtually excited electrons .    due to the larger basis of the ro , the number of admixed configurations is larger than that in the previous ci2 expansion .",
    "83 even configurations and 73 odd ones are selected for the ion @xmath3 using the same selection criterion @xmath31 .",
    "the number of admixed configurations in the ci expansion consistently decreases along the isoelectronic sequence , and , for @xmath4 , there are just 42 even and 39 odd admixed configurations .",
    "the results obtained by such technique are named as ci3 .",
    "the comparison of the results , determined in the ci2 and ci3 approaches , indicates that the level radiative lifetime values are quite close along the isoelectronic sequence , the difference does not exceed 10% .",

    "if the level lies high in the energy spectra , the number of the @xmath10 and @xmath9 transitions is not so limited since a large number of the levels with appropriate @xmath20 values are located lower .",
    "since there are only two levels of the ground configuration , the number of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 transitions always is one or two depending of the @xmath20 value of the initial level .",
    "usually , the high - lying levels have relatively small radiative lifetimes as they have much more open decay channels to the levels of the same configuration .",
    "the number of the transitions to the ground configuration is determined only by the selection rules .",
    "this number does not depend on the level location in the energy spectra .",
    "the @xmath6 transition probability values are similar in magnitude as the @xmath10 probability values for a particular level . nevertheless , the @xmath6 transitions are rather insignificant decay channels for the high - lying levels as there is a large number of the @xmath10 transitions allowed from these levels . furthermore , the dominant @xmath10 transition probabilities are larger for the high - lying levels , as in the case of levels with @xmath79 .",
    "the configuration @xmath1 has thirteen levels with @xmath105 .",
    "figure  [ fig10 ] presents the radiative lifetimes only for six levels .",
    "the lifetimes of other seven levels are close to two curves , which present the lifetimes of levels @xmath91 and @xmath106 ( white and gray triangles ) .",
    "the excluded levels are located higher than the presented ones , and their radiative lifetime dependencies on @xmath33 are very similar to those of the latter two levels , both in a magnitude and in a shape .",

    "transition probabilities ( in s@xmath83 ) from the level @xmath97 .",
    "black triangles and circles denote transitions to the level @xmath101 , white circles - to the level @xmath97 , black diamonds and squares - to the level @xmath102 , white squares - to the level @xmath107 . ]",
    "the radiative lifetimes of the lowest level @xmath97 ( white circles ) are not the largest ones , unlikely to the previous ( @xmath108 ) cases .",
    "these lifetimes are significantly smaller as there is an additional decay channel allowed by the selection rules .",
    "the transition probabilities for this level are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] .",
    "one can notice from fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] that the @xmath5 transition ( black diamonds ) to the ground configuration is the strongest one . on top of that ,",
    "two @xmath6 transitions are allowed , and their transition probability values are larger than those of the @xmath9 transitions .",
    "these three radiative transitions ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) to the ground configuration are very significant . at the lower end of the investigated sequence",
    ", their inclusion decreases the calculated radiative lifetime almost by 2000 times .",
    "further , the influence of these transitions rapidly decreases , and the inclusion of them into the radiative lifetime calculations decreases the lifetime value approximately 13 times at @xmath4 . the reasons for a rapid decrease of the @xmath6 transition values in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] are explained in sect .  [",
    "according to the selection rules for @xmath20 , one @xmath5 transition and two @xmath6 transitions are allowed from this and all other levels with @xmath105 .",
    "the number of the @xmath10 and @xmath9 transitions depends on the location of level examined .",
    "next level with @xmath105 is the level @xmath109 .",
    "black squares denote the radiative lifetime of this level in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] . here",
    "the @xmath5 transition is the strongest one .",
    "but the @xmath5 transition probability value starts to decrease slowly from @xmath110 .",
    "several strong @xmath10 transitions behave in a similar way .",
    "such a drop of the transition probability values causes the radiative lifetime for this level to increase when @xmath111 .",
    "the @xmath5 and @xmath6 transitions are the most significant ones at @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "the inclusion of their probabilities into the the radiative lifetime calculations decrease the lifetime value by more than 450 times . at the top end of the sequence ,",
    "this decrease drops to 3 times .    at the beginning of the sequence , the level @xmath114 has the largest radiative lifetime value ( see fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] , black circles ) .",
    "the quite sharp change of the calculated lifetime for this level between @xmath92 and @xmath115 is caused by the rapid increase of the strongest @xmath5 transition probability value together with that of several @xmath10 transitions .",
    "like for other previously discussed levels with @xmath105 , there is one @xmath5 transition , two @xmath6 transitions and few @xmath10 and @xmath9 transitions .",
    "the @xmath5 transition is the strongest one for @xmath116 , the @xmath6 transitions are not so strong , but their transition probability values are larger than those of the @xmath9 transitions .",
    "the @xmath5 and @xmath6 transitions affect the lifetime of @xmath114 , but no so significantly as the lifetimes of previously discussed levels due to the amount of the @xmath10 and @xmath9 transitions allowed from this level .",
    "the radiative lifetimes of other levels with @xmath105 , located higher in the energy spectra than the discussed ones , are determined mainly by the numerous @xmath10 transitions .",
    "the @xmath9 transitions are also allowed , but they are much weaker than the @xmath10 transitions .",
    "so here the influence of the @xmath6 and @xmath5 transitions is not so outstanding .",
    "although these transitions can not be discarded at all , when the nuclear charge @xmath33 is between 60 and 70 , these transitions decrease the calculated lifetime value up to 4 times .",
    "usually , the decrease drops very quickly . for heavy ions ( @xmath117 )",
    ", the lifetime values change only by few percent .",
    "the configurations @xmath0 , @xmath2 , @xmath19 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath1 of the rh - like ions are investigated using the quasirelativistic approach with a small ci1 expansion for the range from @xmath21 up to @xmath4 .",
    "calculation results demonstrate that the ions with @xmath118 do not have metastable levels in the excited configurations , except for two levels of the the configuration @xmath1 with the largest total angular momentum , @xmath77 .",
    "the levels with @xmath105 of the @xmath19 and @xmath28 configurations are located relatively low in the energy spectra , and the @xmath11 transitions from the @xmath1 configuration levels with @xmath119 are possible to the levels of these configurations .",
    "furthermore , the decay channels through the @xmath5 and @xmath6 transitions to the @xmath19 and @xmath28 are open .",
    "on the other hand , the decay channel through the @xmath10 and @xmath9 transitions is open for the @xmath29 configuration . for the ions with @xmath120 ,",
    "the configuration @xmath29 is close in energy to the @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "these energetically close and strongly interacting excited configurations must be investigated as a single configuration complex .",
    "the present investigation was devoted to the detailed investigation of the configuration @xmath1 metastable levels .",
    "the @xmath1 configuration levels with @xmath121 are metastable ones for the highly - charged ions with @xmath80 .",
    "these ions are investigated thoroughly , using a large ci3 expansion within the basis of the quasirelativistic transformed radial orbitals .",
    "the radiative lifetimes of the levels with @xmath77 and @xmath79 are determined by transitions to the levels with the same parity , i.e. , the @xmath10 and @xmath9 transitions .",
    "it should be noted , that the @xmath10 transition probability values for all investigated ions are much larger ( more than 100 times ) than the ones of the @xmath9 transition .",
    "the radiative lifetimes of the levels @xmath81 and @xmath84 are extremely large ( more than 10 seconds ) due to their position in the energy spectra .",
    "although these two levels are relatively very low in the spectra , the level @xmath81 has three open radiative decay channels through rather weak transitions ( one @xmath10 and two @xmath9 ) .",
    "the level @xmath84 has only one decay channel through the @xmath9 transition .",
    "since the total number of possible @xmath10 and @xmath9 transitions depends on a particular level location , for the high - lying levels with @xmath79 , as well as for other high - lying metastable levels , the @xmath10 transitions primarily determine the calculated level radiative lifetime as their probability values are significantly larger compared to those of the @xmath9 transitions .",
    "the lifetimes of the levels with @xmath100 and @xmath105 are also determined by the transitions to the levels of the same parity , but in this case , the @xmath5 and @xmath6 transitions to the ground configuration of the opposite parity are allowed .",
    "since there are only two levels in the ground configuration , the number of @xmath5 and @xmath6 transitions is strictly defined .",
    "only one @xmath6 transition is possible from each level with @xmath100 ; two @xmath6 transitions and one @xmath5 transition is allowed from each level with @xmath105 .",
    "the number of possible @xmath9 and @xmath10 transitions can vary depending on the location of the particular level in the energy spectra - when a particular level is located higher , the number of allowed @xmath10 and @xmath9 transitions becomes larger .",
    "the @xmath6 transition probability value is similar in magnitude with that of the @xmath10 transitions and is larger than the transition probabilities of @xmath9 for the levels with @xmath100 . for the levels with @xmath105 ,",
    "the @xmath5 transition probability has the largest value for most ions .",
    "the @xmath6 transition probability values are smaller than those of the @xmath10 transitions , but are larger than the @xmath9 transition probabilities for these levels .",
    "the inclusion of @xmath5 and @xmath6 transitions into the radiative lifetime calculation can significantly change determined total radiative lifetime value . if the level position is comparatively high in the energy spectra , the @xmath5 and the @xmath6 transitions are not so significant , although they can not be neglected . for the rh - like ions ,",
    "the decay of the metastable levels through the @xmath10 and the @xmath5 transitions is more significant compared to the decay through the @xmath6 ones . the @xmath9 transition probability values are the smallest ones for all metastable levels , except for the level @xmath84 , which can decay only through the @xmath9 transition .",
