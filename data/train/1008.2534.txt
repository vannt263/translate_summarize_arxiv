    "we utilize the periodic logistic models , described above in detail , to sunflower plant growth data from the classical paper @xcite , where the sunflower  ( helianthus ) was chosen because of the fact that it grows without producing branches and it was thought that measurements of height and weight represented the growth of the entire organism with a fair degree of accuracy .",

    "one may speculate that the sunflower plant was growing about fourteen hours during an average california day from may to august of 1919 and was not growing at all during nights . then by ( 2steplimitzero):@xmath117if the ( sun)light would be provided for twenty four hours every day , say in a greenhouse , expression ( [ interp ] ) should be modified as follows @xmath118with @xmath119 @xmath120 and @xmath121 the corresponding graph is also presented on figure  1 .",
