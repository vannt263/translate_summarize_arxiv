    "global observables such as the multiplicity and the inclusive single particle transverse momentum ( ) and pseudorapidity ( @xmath1 ) distributions of hadrons have been valuable tools in studying heavy ion collisions .",
    "they represent the system at kinetic freeze - out , late in the evolution of the system when hadrons no longer interact with each other , and their momentum spectra do not change further .",
    "these final - state observables supply essential constraints on the possible evolutionary paths of the system that can help establish conditions in the early , hot and dense phase of the collision .",
    "a discussion on global observables can be found in @xcite .",
    "we summarize here results on the minimum - bias multiplicity ,  and @xmath1 spectra of negatively charged hadrons .",
    "the star experimental setup for the first rhic run is described in @xcite .",
    "the analysis is based on charged particle tracking in the star time projection chamber ( tpc ) .",
    "triggering was achieved using two hadronic calorimeters ( zdcs ) in the very forward region and an array of scintillator slats arranged in a barrel ( ctb ) around the tpc .",
    "particle production was studied through the yield of primary negative hadrons ( ) , _ i.e. _ ,  and   including the products of strong and electromagnetic decays .",
    "low momentum ( @xmath2 ) particle identification was done via @xmath3 in the gas of the tpc .",
    "only negatively charged hadrons were studied in order to exclude effects due to participant nucleons .",
    "charged particle tracks reconstructed in the tpc were accepted if they fulfilled requirements on number of points on the track and on pointing accuracy to the event vertex .",
    "the measured raw distributions were corrected for acceptance , reconstruction efficiency , contamination due to interactions in material , misidentified non - hadrons , the products of weak decays , and track splitting and merging .",
    "the tracking efficiency was found by embedding simulated tracks into real events at the raw data level , reconstructing the full events , and comparing the simulated input to the reconstructed output .    for this analysis ,",
    "the acceptance for tracks within the fiducial volume having  greater than 0.3  is found to be 95% .",
    "the tracking efficiency is found to be between 7095% , depending on the particle  and the total multiplicity of the event .",
    "75 mm    figure [ fig : hminus ] shows the  multiplicity distribution for minimum - bias au+au collisions with @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the data were normalized assuming a total hadronic inelastic cross section of 7.2 barn for au+au collisions at = 130 gev , derived from glauber model calculations @xcite .",
    "the systematic error on the vertical scale is estimated to be 10% and is dominated by uncertainties of the total hadronic cross - section and the shape at low @xmath6 .",
    "the systematic error of 6% on the horizontal scale is depicted by horizontal error bars on a few data points .",
    "the shape of the distribution is dominated by the collision geometry : large cross section at low multiplicity , corresponding to large impact parameter , followed by a region of slowly falling cross section over a wide range of multiplicity as the nuclei overlap , and a rapid decrease for near head - on collisions , where the shape is determined by fluctuations in the collision geometry and particle production process given the finite detector acceptance .",
    "the distribution for the 5% most central collisions ( 360 mbarn ) , defined via zdc coincidence , is shown as the shaded area in fig .",
    "[ fig : hminus ] .",
    "figure [ fig : pt ] , upper panel , shows the  distribution for the 5% most central collisions at midrapidity ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "only statistical errors are shown ; the systematic errors are estimated to be below 6% .",
    "the data are fit by a power - law function of the form @xmath8 . as reference data sets ,",
    "we also show the -distribution of negatively charged hadrons for central pb+pb collisions at = 17 gev from na49 @xcite and for minimum - bias  collisions at = 200 gev from ua1 @xcite , fitted with the same function .",
    "the ua1 invariant cross - section @xmath9 reported in ref .",
    "@xcite was scaled by @xmath10 , where @xmath11 mb . the  spectrum measured by star reflects a systematic increase in  compared to that from both central a+a collisions at much lower energy ( na49 ) and  collisions at a comparable energy ( ua1 ) .",
    "80 mm    the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : pt ] shows the ratio of the star and ua1 -distributions .",
    "since the ua1 distribution is measured at = 200 gev , the invariant cross - section in each -bin is scaled by two factors for a quantitative comparison to the star data : _ ( i ) _",
    "@xmath12 , the -dependent ratio of the   yields in  collisions at = 130 and 200 gev , and _",
    "( ii ) _ = 26 mb@xmath13 , the nuclear overlap integral @xcite for the 5% most central au+au collisions . see @xcite for further details .",
    "there are two simple predictions for the scaled ratio .",
    "the study of lower energy collisions has shown that the total pion yield due to soft ( low ) processes scales as the number of participants , i.e.  , `` wounded '' nucleons ( ) in the collision , ( e.g.  @xcite ) . the scaled ratio in this case is 0.164 assuming 172 participant pairs @xcite and a mean number of binary collisions ( ) of @xmath14 for the 5% most central au+au events .",
    "we assume @xmath15 mb for  collisions at @xmath16 gev . if hadron production is due to hard ( high ) processes and there are no nuclear - specific effects ( see below ) , the hadron yield will scale as , which is proportional to the nuclear overlap integral . in this case",
    "the value of the ratio is unity .",
    "there are important nuclear effects which should alter the scaling from these simple predictions , including _",
    "e.g. _ initial state multiple scattering @xcite , jet quenching @xcite , and radial flow @xcite .",
    "each of these exhibits characteristic features as a function of  and system size .",
    "the scaled ratio shows a strong  dependence , starting close to  scaling at low  and approaching  scaling , not reaching the latter in the measured  range even including the errors from the @xmath12 and  scaling shown in gray .",
    "this behaviour is consistent with the presence of radial flow , as well as the onset of hard scattering contributions and initial state multiple scattering with rising .",
    "the shape of the distribution at higher  is discussed in @xcite .",
    "the  density at midrapidity for @xmath17 and @xmath7 is @xmath18 .",
    "extrapolation to @xmath19 = 0 yields @xmath20 . assuming an average of 172 participant pairs per central au+au collision",
    ", this corresponds to @xmath21  per participant nucleon pair per unit of pseudorapidity .",
    "this is a 35% increase over  collisions at the same energy @xcite .",
    "comparison with central  collisions at sps @xcite shows an increase in the  yield per participant of @xmath22 49% at rhic .",
    "[ fig : etacent ] shows the centrality dependence of the @xmath1 distribution .",
    "one sees the expected rise in particle yield with collision centrality .",
    "preliminary analysis shows very little difference in the shape of the distribution at midrapidity with increasing centrality . using again a power - law fit to the  spectra we obtain   which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : meanptcent ] as a function of centrality .",
    "errors on the horizontal scale are systematic .",
    "we see an increase in  of 15% from the most peripheral to the most central events .",
    "the values for the ua1 and na49 reference data sets are also shown .",
    "we have presented preliminary results on charged particle production at rhic .",
    "we find @xmath23 per participant in central   collisions at = 130 gev increases by 35% relative to   and 49% compared to nuclear collisions at = 17 gev . the  distribution is harder than that of the reference systems for the  region up to 2 , with the most central events having the highest .",
    "scaling of produced particle yield with number of participants shows a strong dependence on , with wounded nucleon scaling achieved only at the lowest measured .",
