    "fermionic ultra - cold atoms with nearly resonant scattering in the unitarity regime @xcite realize the strongest possible form of cooper pairing , revealed by critical velocity @xcite .",
    "it is natural to expect that zero - temperature normal states near unitarity would be very strongly correlated with a host of unconventional properties , possibly bearing some resemblance to those found in cuprates @xcite .",
    "the unitarity limit is therefore an excellent starting point for studies of correlated fermionic superconductors and insulators , which has not been exploited enough in literature .",
    "the benefits are both theoretical and experimental .",
    "systematic perturbative and renormalization group calculations are feasible mainly because the unperturbed ground state ( fixed point ) is a simple state , the vacuum or a band insulator .",
    "experimentally , the unitarity limit is routinely accessed in cold gases of alkali atoms tuned near a broad feshbach resonance @xcite .",
    "our ultimate goal is to address the long - standing questions about the nature of unconventional normal states proximate to strongly paired fermionic superfluids or superconductors .",
    "we design here a simple and tractable model in which the fermionic excitation gap is opened by an external periodic potential , rather than strong interactions .",
    "attractive interactions between quasiparticles whose energy scale exceeds this gap can still give rise to pairing and superfluidity . the need for strong interactions justifies asking if the normal state proximate to the superfluid might have some unconventional properties reflecting strong correlations , especially in universal regimes shaped by resonant scattering .",
    "the inquiry into unconventional superfluidity from the resonant scattering point of view began a long time ago @xcite .",
    "the present interest in this subject is driven in parallel by a variety of unconventional superconductors in condensed matter physics , and ultra - cold atoms with nearly resonant scattering .",
    "the recent theoretical studies of scattering resonances in lattice potentials @xcite often rely on two - channel tight - binding models , featuring fermionic atoms resonantly coupled to closed channel bosonic particles .",
    "it has been argued that models of this kind provide a good effective description of the microscopic lattice systems of interest @xcite .",
    "the findings of these studies include lattice feshbach resonances shifted from their empty - space values .",
    "most of the mentioned theoretical works approach resonant scattering from a somewhat microscopic angle , exemplified by perturbation theory with the vacuum unperturbed ground - state .",
    "indeed , the usual universal behavior of particles tuned to a broad feshbach resonance is established in the low density limit . however , universality is a many - body phenomenon and its complete description requires field - theoretical tools such as renormalization group .",
    "this issue becomes pressing in the present problem of interest , a band insulator whose non - interacting ground - state contains a macroscopic number of fermions in fully populated bands",
    ". these fermions may not be dynamically inert despite the pauli exclusion principle , due to the strong interactions which bring the system to its unitarity regime .    in this paper",
    "we take a field - theoretical approach to nearly resonant pairing between gapped fermions .",
    "abandoning all microscopic details in a renormalization group ( rg ) calculation allows us to gain a perspective on the generic and universal behavior of a large class of fermionic lattice systems .",
    "the effective theories we subject to rg are constructed to preserve the universality class of the microscopic system .",
    "this ensures that the universal phase diagram and other macroscopic properties of the microscopic system are correctly captured despite the neglect of microscopic details .",
    "the price to pay is the necessity to deal with multiple flavors of low energy quasiparticles , such as particle and hole excitations which may exist at multiple wavevectors in the first brillouin zone .",
    "note that the two - channel models with dynamical bosonic fields used in many previous studies are not guarantied to be in the same universality class as the microscopic system , and may in some cases describe different physics than this paper .",
    "we characterize the universality stemming from resonant scattering of quasiparticles in band insulators , and discover generalized unitarity regimes in which quasiparticles of different flavors scatter resonantly .",
    "the manifestations of unitarity which we discuss include universal ratios of measurable quantities such as critical temperature , pressure and density .",
    "we also analyze the types and conditions for pairing instabilities , conventional versus unconventional superfluid transitions , and emphasize the existence of correlated bosonic mott insulating states in the phase diagram .",
    "the rg analysis reveals why pairing fluctuations indeed play the crucial role in systems of gapped fermions with short - range attractive interactions . unlike previous studies of unitarity in continuum lattice potentials , which focused on the zero - density limit @xcite",
    ", we point out that the unitarity regime in the same universality class can be found at finite densities near any zero temperature band insulator to superfluid transition .",
    "the structure of fixed points depends on whether both particles and holes participate equally in the dynamics , or just one of the two quasiparticle types . in the latter case ,",
    "the exact rg equations can be derived , which allows one to track the run - away flows of attractive interaction couplings ( as in some studies of iron - pnictides @xcite ) .",
    "it is these run - away flows that can lead to boson - dominated dynamics at low energies .",
    "we find that instabilities in the particle - hole channel are discouraged by attractive interactions .",
    "the run - away flows imply the ultimate rg breakdown when the diverging couplings reach cut - off scales .",
    "however , the resulting low energy bosonic dynamics is known to introduce additional fixed points associated with superfluid transitions @xcite , which appear as strong - coupling fixed points in the present rg .",
    "the superfluid transition in this regime can be either in the bosonic mean - field , or xy universality class .",
    "the mean - field universality with dynamical exponent @xmath0 emerges as the result of run - away flows from the unitarity dominated by either particles or holes , while the @xmath1 xy universality is related in the same fashion to the unitarity shaped by _ both _ particles and holes .",
    "therefore , the analysis here provides a glimpse of the more complete structure of fixed points in theories of fermionic particles with attractive interactions , sketched in fig.[fullrg ] .",
    "the mentioned finite - density fixed points describe unitarity in zero - density effective theories of particle and hole excitations .",
    "therefore , one can relate a nearly critical interaction strength to scattering lengths in collisions among particles and holes .",
    "any attractive interaction in two dimensions effectively puts the low energy quasiparticles into their bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) limit , so quasiparticles injected in the insulating state immediately combine into bound - state pairs @xcite ( whose size can be very large at weak couplings ) .",
    "the effective bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) regime exists only above two dimensions , at least in the weak coupling limit ( @xmath2 in fig.[fullrg ] ) .",

    "the density of particles is tuned to any number of completely populated bands at zero temperature by placing the chemical potential @xmath13 in a bandgap .",
    "the dynamics of the resulting band insulator can be described by an effective theory of low - energy quasiparticles belonging to the valence and conduction bands .",
    "sufficiently strong attractive interactions @xmath4 can drive the system into a superfluid state , and a similar instability can be created by bringing the chemical potential sufficiently close to a band edge , even at weak couplings .",
    "a qualitative example of the superfluid - insulator transitions is shown in fig.[pd1 ] .",
    "( color online ) superfluid transitions ( thick red lines ) out of a two - dimensional band insulator at zero temperature .",

    "the most generic transitions are driven by the chemical potential @xmath13 , so that only one band is important ( see fig.[pd1 ] , ( p ) and ( h ) trajectories ) .",
    "the transitions involving particles and holes ( the ( ph ) trajectory in fig.[pd1 ] ) require at least two bands for a complete description .",
    "a potential problem recognized in a number of studies is that in the vicinity of resonant scattering the microscopic interactions may correspond to energy scales ( much ) larger than the bandgap .",
    "then , many high energy bands may be significantly hybridized with the conduction and valence bands . in the present formulation of the problem",
    ", this can lead to a strong renormalization of low - energy quasiparticle dispersions @xmath21 and effective interactions @xmath22 . in most circumstances",
    "this does not endanger the analysis which follows .",
    "the goal of this paper is to explore the universal properties of nearly resonantly interacting fermions in periodic potentials , for the purpose of which we apply renormalization group .",
    "therefore , the precise functional forms and values of the effective @xmath21 and @xmath22 are not of interest , and we do not attempt to derive them from any microscopic model .",
    "the perturbative expansions of @xmath21 and @xmath22 , in powers of the ratio @xmath23 between the microscopic interaction strength @xmath4 and the smallest energy @xmath24 of the integrated high - energy fermions , need not converge fast",
    ". however , these expansions must be convergent , otherwise the effective @xmath21 and @xmath22 would contain singular features which would invalidate our analysis .",
    "in general there should be a minimum number of bands which must be kept in the effective theory in order for it to be properly analytic , and this number may grow when one approaches the resonant scattering in empty space at @xmath25 .",
    "we shall assume that this number is never larger than two in the present cases of interest .",
    "an assumption of this kind is made in all other studies and it is justified by the fact that a lattice potential shifts the scattering resonance from its empty - space position toward the effective lattice bec limit @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the effective unitarity limit in a lattice which we seek to describe corresponds to the bcs regime in empty space for the same microscopic interactions , where @xmath23 is not too large .",
    "here we apply renormalization group ( rg ) to a band insulator in the unitarity regime . we will identify various fixed points associated with unitarity ( resonant two - body scattering ) which emerge in the presence of an external periodic potential @xmath10 , but otherwise are analogous to the unitarity fixed point of a uniform system at @xmath25 .",
    "the main difference is that the fixed points we shall discuss occur at finite densities of microscopic particles , corresponding to fully occupied bands , whereas universality in the uniform system stems from a _ zero density _ fixed point .",
    "there are two characteristic situations which will be considered separately .",
    "first , one fermion species ( either particles or holes ) generally dominates dynamics in the unitarity regime , so the renormalization group equations can be derived exactly to all orders of perturbation theory .",
    "this is extremely useful because run - away flows of interaction couplings can be traced more reliably .",
    "the second situation is more special and occurs when both particles and holes participate equally in dynamics .",
    "then , the fixed point structure becomes intricate , but can be accessed only in an @xmath26 ( or large-@xmath27 ) expansion . at the end",
    "we briefly discuss extensions to more realistic cases with multiple relevant fermion species , and measurable manifestations of the universality class .      a transition dominated by either particles or holes , but not both ,",
    "is generally caused by chemical potential changes as illustrated in fig.[pd1 ] with ( p ) and ( h ) dashed lines . as a natural starting point",
    "one can imagine a band insulator either in the deep bcs limit , or with a very deep lattice potential , where the chemical potential is brought much closer to one of the bands than to the other . however , such extreme regimes are not necessary initially because they are created by the rg flow ( the bandgap is a relevant operator ) .",
    "we shall discover that an attractive interaction undergoes a run - away flow in two dimensions and competes with the bandgap .",
    "this competition is resolved at cut - off scales where the rg breaks down .",
    "however , a new strongly - coupled universality class takes over in that limit , associated with superfluid to mott - insulator transition with dynamical exponent @xmath0 at the intersection of the thick red and dashed - blue lines ( p ) or ( h ) in fig.[pd1 ] .",
    "a characteristic weak - coupling interacting fixed point contained in a theory of interacting fermions is unitarity , and it is found at zero temperature when the chemical potential lies exactly at the boundary between a fermion band and a bandgap ( or vacuum ) .",
    "the effective action contains a single species of interacting spinful fermions , not much different from the theory of the system without a lattice .",
    "if these fermions live in a valence band , we can immediately reformulate the theory in terms of holes .",
    "therefore , we can always write the critical effective theory in the limit of zero quasiparticle density . the universality class at unitarity will be the same as discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "the critical theory of interest in @xmath28 dimensions , augmented by the relevant chemical potential is : @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 all fermion loop feynman diagrams vanish ( the poles of the green s functions on the loop lie in the same complex half - plane ) , and only the interaction coupling is renormalized by a summable geometric progression of ladder diagrams .",
    "the exact rg equations are found to be @xcite : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the scale parameter , @xmath35 is the effective bandgap , and @xmath36 is a positive cutoff - dependent constant .",
    "a fixed point is always found at @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",
    "an additional non - trivial fixed point is found in @xmath39 at @xmath37 , @xmath40 , which describes attractive interactions if @xmath41 .",
    "the schematic flow of interaction couplings is shown in fig.[rg1 ] .",
    "the rg flow of the interaction coupling @xmath4 in the theory ( [ crittheory1]).,width=211 ]    any attractive interaction @xmath42 in @xmath43 has a run - away flow to @xmath8 , while in @xmath41 it needs to be large enough to flow toward @xmath8 .",
    "repulsive interactions @xmath44 , on the other hand , flow to the gaussian fixed point in @xmath45 .",
    "therefore , only attractive interactions can produce strongly correlated states .",
    "since the rg equations are exact , we can precisely characterize the run - away flow , assuming that the effect of multi - body collisions remains negligible at least in the insulating state . solving for @xmath46 in two and three dimensions",
    "we obtain : @xmath47        \\frac{u(0)}{\\lbrack 1+\\pi u(0 ) \\rbrack",
    "e^l-\\pi u(0 ) } & , & d=3      \\end{array }    \\right\\rbrace\\ ] ] in both cases ,",
    "the run - away flows have vertical asymptotes so that @xmath46 diverges at a finite value of @xmath34 ( @xmath48 in @xmath43 ) .",
    "this indicates that cooper pairs become stable at a finite length scale and have a finite coherence length despite the fermion bandgap .",
    "however , the interpretation of the run - away flow breaks - down at the cut - off scale because so large @xmath4 will pair - up the high - energy fermions , which were assumed to be unpaired in this rg procedure .",
    "a boson - dominated dynamics takes over the shortest length - scales under consideration .    note that @xmath49 at a finite @xmath34 can not be immediately interpreted as a signal of superfluidity",
    "this is due to the fact that at finite @xmath34 we do not yet have a theory which transparently describes dynamics at macroscopic scales , while superfluidity is verified only by macroscopic long - range correlations . since rg is based on integrating out _ high energy _",
    "modes , it does not provide a precise answer to the question of what phase the system lives in , but only gives an indication .",
    "the fermion gap in an insulating state grows exponentially under rg , @xmath50 . if @xmath51 is the first to reach the cutoff scale , the further rg flow is halted ( rg breaks down ) in a state apparently devoid of particles",
    "this is a band insulator .",
    "it is obtained in @xmath52 dimensions for any sufficiently weak interaction @xmath53 , or even for @xmath54 provided that the gap @xmath55 is large enough .",
    "if @xmath46 is the first to reach its cutoff instead , then boson - dominated dynamics at shortest length - scales requires switching to a purely bosonic effective theory in order to determine what happens at large length - scales .",
    "both insulating and superfluid phases are possible in this limit , despite a finite fermion gap , but the transition between them is in a different universality class than the bcs pair - breaking transition .",
    "a special case is obtained in the vicinity of vanishing gaps for both particle and hole excitations . a pairing transition influenced by a corresponding fixed point",
    "can not be obtained by changing the chemical potential alone , but can be accessed by tuning interaction strength or lattice depth , at a fixed particle density ( see fig.[pd1 ] , the ( ph ) dashed line ) .",
    "the values of @xmath13 and @xmath15 should lie at the intersection of effective conduction and valence bands where the effective bandgap closes .",
    "we shall again discover a run - away flow of interaction couplings , but this time it quickly invalidates the perturbative rg .",
    "the run - away flow is expected to eventually lead to a strong - coupling fixed point in the xy universality class , associated with the superconductor to mott - insulator transition at an integer number of bosons per lattice site .",
    "the critical theory for valence ( @xmath56 ) and conduction ( @xmath57 ) electrons is : @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 here we made the simplest assumption that the bandgap @xmath61 is direct and small ( or vanishing ) at only one wavevector in the brillouin zone .",
    "modifications of this assumption are straight - forward and the appropriate more realistic circumstances will be discussed in the following section .",
    "performing a particle - hole transformation for the valence band can not help us construct an exact rg procedure .",
    "instead , it is convenient to work directly with the native particle degrees of freedom .",
    "the interaction couplings @xmath22 in the band representation are derived from microscopic short - range interactions in real - space .",
    "for example , a pure contact interaction @xmath62 in ( [ contmodel1 ] ) gives : @xmath63 where uc indicates integration over the lattice unit - cell , and @xmath64 are bloch wave - functions .",
    "this expression illustrates an important property of interactions in the band representation which follows from the overlap features of the bloch wavefunctions . as a rule of thumb ,",
    "the couplings @xmath22 are largest by magnitude if @xmath65 for both @xmath66 and smallest if @xmath67 for both @xmath66 .",
    "the strongest interaction channels involve a single band , while the interband couplings are weaker .",
    "this is a natural situation for generic band structures and short - range interactions , but it could be reversed in principle .",
    "it is important to note that the spatial dependence of the microscopic interaction potential @xmath68 on the distance @xmath69 between the interacting particles is not automatically irrelevant ( in the rg sense ) in the presence of the lattice .",
    "short - range variations of @xmath68 , at or below the lattice spacing length - scale , affect the relative strength of the couplings @xmath22 , which may lead to non - trivial interacting fixed points as discussed below . only the long - range variations and the related crystal momentum dependence of the interaction couplings are not relevant in the vicinity of the fixed points of interest .",
    "after normal ordering the interactions take the form :    @xmath70    the generated quadratic terms @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the particle density in the ground - state , are similar to a `` charging energy '' since they effectively shift the chemical potential as a result of interactions .",
    "however , they also couple the particles in the two bands , so we must redefine the bare green s function .",
    "one way to accomplish this is to treat @xmath73 as a self - energy correction to the non - interacting green s function @xmath74 : @xmath75 it is convenient to define @xmath76 and @xmath77 ( note that @xmath78 ) .",
    "then : @xmath79 are the new poles of the bare fermion excitations , and @xmath80 it is easy to show that both poles are always real , one being positive ( particle - like ) and the other negative ( hole - like ) as long as @xmath81 .",
    "we will assume that the latter condition is satisfied , so that the system is a band insulator despite the `` charging energy '' .",
    "consequently , we can expand the poles up to @xmath82 : @xmath83 where @xmath84 are the bare quasiparticle gaps , and @xmath85 are the quasiparticle masses given by : @xmath86 the parameter @xmath87 captures the amount of mixing between the two bands ( @xmath88 ) ; @xmath89 is the effective fermion bandgap . for @xmath90",
    "there is no band mixing since @xmath91 . in general , @xmath92 is required in order for both @xmath85 to remain positive .",
    "otherwise , band inversion is caused by large interband couplings and it must be taken into account by redefining the low - energy quasiparticles , which then live at some different momenta in the first brillouin zone .",
    "we shall come back to this situation at the end .",
    "now we set up the rg . as usual",
    ", we keep the masses @xmath93 and @xmath94 in the absence of interactions fixed under rg . while this does not imply that @xmath85 will be fixed , it sets the scaling dimension for the field operators to @xmath95 .",
    "the scaling of coordinates and couplings @xmath96 is followed by the diagrammatic integration of high - energy fields living at all matsubara frequencies and momenta within a shell @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is a cut - off momentum scale and @xmath99 is an infinitesimal increment of the scale parameter @xmath34 .",

    "these interactions are diagrammatically represented in the table [ tabvertices ] .",
    "the rg equations for @xmath90 are : @xmath127    above two dimensions , there are seventeen fixed points with @xmath90 .",
    "sixteen of these fixed points @xmath128 are given by all possible combinations of : @xmath129 note that here @xmath130 is always zero .",
    "the rg eigenvalues in the subspace of @xmath131 are @xmath132 at all of these fixed points , and allow enumerating @xmath128 simply by the variations of relevant / irrelevant flows of @xmath131 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.[rg2 ] for the first fifteen fixed points at which at least one of the @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 couplings is zero .",
    "only the gaussian fixed point is fully stable , while @xmath137 with all @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 non - zero is fully unstable .",
    "the coupling @xmath130 is irrelevant only at the gaussian fixed point , while it is found to be marginal at @xmath138 and relevant otherwise .",
    "the remaining fixed point @xmath139 is the only one with @xmath140 : @xmath141 it has only one relevant direction with rg eigenvalue @xmath26 , the @xmath130 component being the largest in the corresponding eigenvector .",
    "the rg flow in the vicinity of this fixed point is illustrated in fig.[rg3 ] .",

    "we can identify the resonantly scattering quasiparticles by tuning to a fixed point with only one finite coupling and then taking a closer look at the operator corresponding to that coupling . in the case of @xmath149 ,",
    "the operator is @xmath150 where the operator @xmath151 annihilates an interband singlet and the operators @xmath152 , @xmath153 and @xmath154 annihilate triplet pairs .",
    "the fixed point(s ) at @xmath155 can now be associated with the resonant scattering in the interband singlet cooper channel .",
    "note that the absence of fixed points at @xmath156 rules out resonant scattering in the attractive triplet channel ( the fixed point at @xmath157 , @xmath158 is fully repulsive in the particle - particle channel ) .",
    "the interaction @xmath159 at its resonant - scattering fixed point is repulsive in the particle - particle channel and can not lead to a cooper pair resonance .",
    "however , it becomes attractive in the particle - hole channel .",
    "keeping only @xmath148 finite allows performing a particle - hole transformation in the valence band , after which the theory contains two similarly dispersing fermion fields ( particles and holes ) in their vacuum states , interacting attractively . denoting the particle and hole annihilation operators as @xmath160 and @xmath161 respectively , where @xmath162 is the opposite spin of @xmath103 ,",
    "the @xmath148 operator can be written as @xmath163 now the operators @xmath164 , @xmath165 , @xmath166 and @xmath167 annihilate singlet and triplet particle - hole pairs .",
    "this interaction does not make any distinction between different spins , so that a scattering resonance appears simultaneously in the singlet and all triplet channels .",
    "the bound - state resulting from this resonance is an exciton , and symmetry breaking at finite particle and hole density can be either a singlet exciton condensate , or a ferromagnetic state depending on the other couplings as well as higher order terms in the action . in both cases , the present effective theory would favor ordering at zero wavevector , but the circumstances discussed in the following section could lead to antiferromagnetic and other kinds of ordering at finite wavevectors .    the behavior of @xmath130 does not fit this generic resonant scattering picture . only at the @xmath139 fixed point",
    "we find the flow of @xmath130 reminiscent of resonant scattering .",
    "the absence of other similar fixed points with @xmath168 , and the fact that the relevant direction at @xmath139 is an almost even - amplitude linear combination of multiple couplings , indicate different physics : an `` assisted scattering resonance '' in the cooper channel between a pair of fermions dynamically resonating between the conduction and valence bands .",
    "in fact , assuming @xmath169 in ( [ scalint ] ) , a sufficiently strong interaction of this type would give rise to an extended `` sign - changing '' @xmath170-wave superfluidity in which the pairing gap on the conduction and valence bands has opposite signs .",
    "such an @xmath171 pairing is proposed to occur in iron pnictides @xcite .",
    "other kinds of pairings with different relative phases between the conduction and valence band pairing gaps could be obtained for other values of @xmath172 .",
    "the run - away flows in the vicinity of these fixed points are also very important .",
    "they indicate the kinds of instabilities of interacting fermions in lattice potentials and circumstances in which they can develop .",
    "this information has greater practical use than the detailed properties of the fixed points , because realistic systems can hardly be tuned very close to these fixed points ( except cold atom systems which are tunable to the @xmath173 and/or @xmath174 fixed points ) . in generic lattice systems with attractive interactions",
    "we find that the favored phases are featureless insulators and superconductors .",
    "a singlet superconductor is indicated by the flow of interaction couplings @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath136 toward @xmath175 , although as emphasized in the previous section such run - away flows can also produce bosonic mott insulators in certain cases .",
    "instabilities in the particle - hole channel are discouraged in normal circumstances with attractive microscopic interactions .",
    "even if the interband couplings end up having repulsive character , the generic lattice and microscopic interaction potentials produce relatively small @xmath135 in comparison to @xmath133 and @xmath134 , so that a typical system with attractive interactions in @xmath176 dimensions flows either to a charge - dynamics influenced insulator state , or toward particle - particle instabilities . with repulsive interactions , however , the same kind of flows near the fixed points featuring @xmath135 take the system either to spin - dynamics influenced insulators , or toward the particle - hole instabilities .",
    "finding the full structure of fixed points for any @xmath177 requires allowing all mixing interband couplings to be finite .",
    "preliminary numerical calculations indeed reveal the existence of additional fixed points with finite mixing interactions and @xmath178 . however , a systematic search for these fixed points is very difficult due to the large parameter space and the highly non - linear nature of the rg equations that allow @xmath103 to flow .",
    "the details of these fixed points are not crucial for the present discussion and will not be pursued further .",
    "now we return to the possibility of band inversion which occurs for @xmath179 .",
    "first , we note that in normal microscopic circumstances @xmath103 is close to unity because the intraband couplings @xmath180 are larger than the interband ones @xmath102 , @xmath181 .",
    "the rg flow further accentuates this situation as the flow of all @xmath102 is exponential . however , if the interband couplings are large enough in comparison to the intraband ones , we must cure the resulting effective band inversion by identifying the true low energy quasiparticles , which must live at some new crystal wavevectors .",
    "the appropriate rg equations need to deal with more than two fermion flavors .",
    "attractive interactions in such strong interband channels would naturally lead to paired states which spontaneously break translational symmetry , while repulsive interactions would give rise to patterned exciton condensates .",
    "the lowest energy quasiparticles in band insulators are often concentrated around multiple symmetry - related wavevectors in the brillouin zone .",
    "for example , the simple cubic periodic potential in three dimensions @xmath182 produces a band insulator with two fermions per site ( for not too small @xmath15 ) whose lowest hole excitations live at @xmath183 in the valence band and lowest particle excitations live at @xmath184 and two other symmetry - related wavevectors @xmath185 , @xmath186 in the conduction band",
    ". an effective fermionic theory of this band insulator requires either one hole or three particle fields for generic pairing transitions of the type discussed in section [ secp ] .",
    "the discussion in section [ secph ] has to be extended to one hole and three particle fields in this case .",
    "an effective theory will generally include couplings among all of its fermion fields , and some of the couplings will have the same value by symmetries . as a prototype theory we can take the action ( [ seff ] ) allowing the labels @xmath187 to identify any relevant fermion flavor . like before ,",
    "the rg analysis would reveal fixed points and run - away flows corresponding to same - flavor pairing and flavor - mixing instabilities .",
    "the latter kind could lead to supersolid phases in the particle - particle channel , or exciton condensates in the particle - hole channel , both bringing translational symmetry breaking and new universality classes . on the other hand ,",
    "the same - flavor pairing instabilities are the most likely outcome of generic attractive interactions in lattice potentials due to the typically dominant couplings in the same - flavor channel .",
    "all superfluid transitions in the unitarity limit which involve only the same - flavor pairing always belong to the same universality class .",
    "this universality class can be characterized by critical ratios between pressure , temperature , energy per particle , and chemical potential ( relative to the band edge ) at small but finite quasiparticle densities . a useful way of calculating the critical ratios involves applying a hubbard - stratonovich transformation to the model ( [ contmodel1 ] ) to decouple the short - range interaction , and then promoting the obtained two - channel model to an sp(@xmath188 ) symmetry group by introducing @xmath27 copies of the spinful fermion fields which couple to the same hubbard - stratonovich field .",
    "fluctuation corrections to the mean - field thermodynamic functions take the form of @xmath189 expansions , so at least in the limit of large @xmath27 one can obtain systematic perturbative expressions in the absence of a natural small parameter near unitarity . taking the physical value @xmath190 and including",
    "only the lowest order correction ( `` gaussian fluctuations '' of the order parameter ) already produces very good estimates in the uniform system @xcite .",
    "provided that the inter - flavor scattering vanishes at the fixed point , trivial adjustments are needed to accommodate multiple fermion flavors in the presence of a lattice , most notably in the ratios derived from extensive quantities , such as those containing pressure and energy density .",
    "for example , the critical pressure @xmath191 at the finite - temperature @xmath192 superfluid transition ( in @xmath193 ) @xmath194 acquires a factor of @xmath195 in the denominator on the left - hand side , the total number of low - energy particle and hole flavors in the brillouin zone ( @xmath196 is the zero - temperature degeneracy pressure of the band insulator ) .",
    "the value of @xmath195 depends on the bandgap @xmath5 ; in the limit @xmath197 both particle and hole flavors should be counted in @xmath195 , otherwise only particles or holes are important based on the chemical potential .",
    "another small adjustment of the uniform system @xmath189 expansions in ref.@xcite is needed in the critical ratios involving the chemical potential .",
    "we need to express the chemical potential @xmath13 relative to the nearest band edge .",
    "if the conduction band is nearest , then the finite quasiparticle density at zero temperature is obtained when @xmath198 , while finite density requires @xmath199 if the valence band is nearest .",
    "the critical temperatures at both @xmath198 and @xmath199 are universal functions of @xmath200 : @xmath201 this expression applies even in the limit @xmath197 when both particles and holes are important , because this limit can be interpreted as @xmath202 .",
    "if the lattice depth is so small that the bandgap closes ( @xmath37 ) , we must take the larger of the two values of @xmath200 obtained by measuring the chemical potential with respect to the overlapping `` conduction '' and `` valence '' band edges .",
    "additional phase transitions below @xmath203 are possible for @xmath204 , involving the onset of pairing in different channels : particle , hole and interband , each characterized by its own order parameter ( see previous section ) . re - entrant behavior can be anticipated in this regime when only one fermion species is paired at @xmath205 and another one is separated from the chemical potential by a gap smaller than @xmath203 .",
    "then , the thermal population of the fermions across the gap can lead to pairing in additional channels at @xmath206 .",
    "anisotropy associated with low - energy quasiparticles at symmetry - transforming wavevectors in the brillouin zone is equally easily treated . for any quasiparticle flavor with dispersion",
    "@xmath207 we redefine momentum so that @xmath208 , where @xmath209 is a mass to be determined",
    ". the measure in path integrals acquires a factor of @xmath210 from this change of variables , which can be absorbed into the redefinition of matter fields .",
    "this also leads to a renormalization of all interaction couplings .",
    "the choice @xmath211 converts the quasiparticle dispersion into an isotropic one without renormalizing any fields or couplings .",
    "it is therefore this geometric mean which should replace the mass in all @xmath189 expansions .",
    "we considered a band insulator subjected to pairing in the unitarity regime as a model system .",
    "the simplest realization of such a system is found in trapped neutral ultra - cold gases of alkali atoms placed in an optical lattice .",
    "the density of atoms can be chosen to correspond to two atoms per lattice site in the central portion of the trap , while the strength of attractive interactions among them is routinely controlled by the feshbach resonance .",
    "a superfluid transition from a thermally excited band insulator has been already experimentally studied in this kind of a system in the vicinity of the bcs - bec crossover @xcite .",
    "the focus of our analysis was the characterization of the universal phase diagram featuring @xmath205 transitions between band insulators and superfluid states . in @xmath41 dimensions we identified a bcs limit",
    "in which this transition is pair - breaking , meaning that its universal properties are transparently captured by a bcs - like theory .",
    "a special limiting case of the pair - breaking transition is found at unitarity , where all interaction effects become independent of microscopic scales , leading to the universal dependence of critical temperature and other thermodynamic functions on the particle density in the superfluid state .",
    "the bec limit , found at any interaction strength in @xmath43 or at sufficiently strong interactions in @xmath41 , brings a different universality class to superfluid transitions .",
    "fermionic excitations belong to high energies , so the effective theory capturing the transition has only bosonic fields .",
    "the transition occurs between the superfluid and a bosonic mott insulator .",
    "the universality class is characterized either by the dynamical exponent @xmath0 ( generic bosonic mean - field transitions driven by the chemical potential ) , or @xmath1 ( xy transitions driven at fixed density of two fermions per lattice site ) .",
    "the bcs and bec limits considered here are relative to a particular band insulator with a fixed lattice potential and particle density at zero temperature . while the particle density is finite in the ground - state , the unitarity regime between these bcs and bec limits",
    "is found at zero quasiparticle density in the effective low - energy theory describing the band insulator .",
    "the full microscopic model includes short - range interactions and multiple fermion bands , with the chemical potential residing in a bandgap .",
    "integrating out high - energy fermions leaves behind the effective theory featuring at most two bands immediately adjacent to the chemical potential ( the conduction and valence bands ) .",
    "the remaining low energy fermions experience renormalized interactions , and may exist in multiple flavors as quasiparticles and quasiholes concentrated around different symmetry - related wavevectors in the first brillouin zone ( individually having anisotropic dynamics ) .",
    "all of this complexity reduces to a few relevant interaction couplings in the vicinity of renormalization group ( rg ) fixed points that signify universal behavior , the most naturally occurring ones corresponding to unitarity in the same universality class as if the system were microscopically uniform .",
    "the physical meaning of these fixed points , revealed by rg , is the resonant scattering of quasiparticles .",
    "multiple flavors of quasiparticles give rise to multiple possibilities for resonant scattering .",
    "an interesting discovered possibility is the resonant scattering between particles and holes in the presence of repulsive interactions , the unitarity limit in the particle - hole channel separating the regimes with non - existing and existing exciton bound states ( excitonic `` bcs '' and `` bec '' regimes respectively ) .",
    "other possibilities not elaborated here also exist in generic circumstances with multiple fermion flavors , leading to translational symmetry breaking in ordered states . however , most of these universal regimes may be inaccessible in realistic systems because they involve tuning either the details of lattice potentials , or short - range spatial features ( at the lattice spacing scales ) of the microscopic interaction potential .    the notable exception",
    "are unitarity regimes in the uniform particle - particle and hole - hole channels , which can be reached in cold atom systems using feshbach resonances .",
    "the simplest to obtain is the unitarity at a transition driven by the chemical potential , which is naturally found in a trapped gas of cold atoms at an interface between the superfluid and insulating atom clouds . in this case",
    "the rg identifies only one relevant interaction parameter , which is tuned by the feshbach resonance .",
    "the transitions driven at fixed density by changing the interaction strength or lattice depth are harder to push to the full unitarity because there are two rg relevant operators ( particle - particle and hole - hole scattering lengths ) which need to be tuned to their fixed point values .",
    "nevertheless , manifestations of this kind of unitarity can be observed at finite temperatures if the critical temperature is larger than the bandgap .",
    "the rg also provides an indication of the macroscopic properties of states away from the fixed points .",
    "if the strength of attractive interactions @xmath4 is smaller by magnitude than its fixed - point value @xmath212 in @xmath176 dimensions , then a gapped fermion system is macroscopically a band insulator . otherwise , the coupling @xmath4 flows toward @xmath175 under rg at _ finite length scales _ , implying the formation of cooper pairs at short length scales before the onset of superfluidity at large length scales .",
    "it is in this manner that the fermionic rg predicts the existence of bosonic mott insulators , but a bosonic effective theory is then required to access the superfluid transition at macroscopic scales .",
    "perhaps the main significance of the presented rg analysis is that the most generic weak - coupling fixed points in fermionic theories , which control the universal properties of insulating and superfluid phases , can be interpreted as resonant scattering .",
    "there is a distinction between appropriate `` bcs '' and `` bec '' regimes in different kinds of pairing channels , in terms of the existence of appropriate two - quasiparticle bound states .",
    "the run - away flows of interaction couplings in the `` bec '' regimes signify the emergence of correlated insulating states separated from ordered phases by transitions in bosonic universality classes . in some circumstances",
    "these `` bec - limit '' insulators may be thermodynamic phases , such as a valence - bond crystal or a spin liquid adjacent to an antiferromagnet ( condensate of excitonic `` molecules '' ) , or a charge - density wave adjacent to a superconductor .",
    "therefore , the presented model and analysis provide a direct insight into the possibilities for the development of strong pairing correlations in fermionic lattice systems .",
    "the emergence of boson - dominated superfluid transitions among fermions and the corresponding universality classes can be traced down to the well known physics of bcs - bec crossovers . even if interactions are not strong enough to bring the system close to its unitarity limit in empty space , the presence of a lattice frustrates the motion of particles and promotes interaction effects , effectively pushing the system toward its lattice unitarity @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in two dimensions there is no bcs limit strictly speaking .",
    "two quasiparticles injected into the conduction band will form a bound state regardless of how weak the attractive interactions are .",
    "of course , the size of this `` vacuum '' bound state might be much larger than the spacing between particles , but this does not preclude the bosonic universality of the superfluid transition .",
    "one potentially important aspect of this is that a conceptually similar situation is found in cuprate high temperature superconductors .",
    "cuprates are quasi two - dimensional systems in which the underdoped normal state ( pseudogap ) exhibits gapped fermionic quasiparticles , albeit with a specific @xmath28-wave pairing symmetry and a gap of completely different origin than in this paper . a number of unconventional properties of cuprates can be qualitatively understood as being related to a fluctuation - driven transition .",
