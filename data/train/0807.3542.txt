    "x-1  and other roche lobe overflowing soft x - ray transient  ( sxt ) binary systems , the thermal viscous disk instability model ( dim ; * ? ? ?",

    "the dim alone however can not produce realistic fred outbursts .",
    "another mechanism that plays a key role during outbursts of sxts is x - ray irradiation .",
    "the irradiation is caused by the intense x - rays from the inner regions of the accretion disk and neutron star  surface ( if the system harbors a neutron star ) impinging on the outer disk / donor , and by re - emission of this impinged energy in lower energies @xcite .",
    "another catagory of modifications to the dim is generated by the possible truncation of the inner region of the accretion flow , where the disk inflow can be replaced by a radiatively inefficient accretion flow ( riaf ) .",
    "there is an increasing body of work on this topic @xcite , but the overall impact of these efforts on the outburst morphology is currently still unclear",

    "states_. see e.g. @xcite and @xcite for extensive discussions on definition of states and @xcite for their timing properties . despite",
    "the multitude of states observed in the different systems and different outbursts , two `` canonical '' states can be identified during the outburst of most sxts , characterised by presence or absence of a thermal and nonthermal component in the energy spectrum . in the temporal domain , presence or absence of a thermal component usually shows up respectively as low or high rms variability in the light curve .",
    "a host of other intermediate and extreme states are also seen , which could be a superposition of the thermal and nonthermal components with varying contributions .",
    "precise determination of x - ray state requires modeling of spectral energy distribution and fourier power density spectra .",
    "since this work primarily focusses mainly on oir observations , we have used dates of x - ray state transitions of aquila  x-1   from published studies of x - ray spectral and temporal properties of the source @xcite to study correlation between x - ray state and oir flux - density .",
    "we have observed aquila  x-1  for @xmath4 years , through many outbursts , to explore the nature of outburst morphologies in a single object .",
    "even though the oir ( as well as x - ray ) light curve morphologies from outburst to outburst differ , we find systematic and repeated tracks traced by the source in oir color - magnitude diagrams .",
    "since we have long - term data in two bandpasses ( r and j ) only , we have used a simple model to show that the color evolution and the resulting track are consistent with heating of a constant area blackbody and can be caused by an irradiated outer disc .    in  [ sec :",

    "finally we present our discussions in  [ sec : discuss ] .",
    "our long term monitoring campaign used the yale 1.0 m telescope at cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) in chile to observe aquila  x-1  from 1998 - 2002 on a daily basis ( weather and sun - angle constraints permitting ) .",
    "since february 2003 , the ctio 1.3 m telescope has been used for the monitoring . in both cases",

    "prior to mjd 52430 ( 2002 june 5 ) , the optical r - band data were recorded by a lick / loral-3 @xmath5 ccd .",
    "thereafter , the r - band has been recorded by a fairchild 447 @xmath5 ccd .",
    "the near - ir j - band data are recorded by a rockwell @xmath6 hgcdte astronomical wide area infrared imager ( hawaii ) imager . between mjd 5113051367 ( 1998 november 13  1999 july 8th ) ,",
    "the source was observed using a `` wide - r '' filter .",
    "the wide - r filter has a broader bandpass than the johnson r filter used during the rest of the campaign .",
    "even though a determination of the johnson r - band flux can not be made from the wide - r - band measurements , the light curve morphology changes little due to the change of filter .",
    "we calculated the quiescent wide - r - band differential magnitude ( between mjd 51232 and mjd 51306 ) and applied an offset to the differential magnitudes obtained using wide - r filter so that the quiescent level was set to 18.8 magnitude , which is the quiescent r - band magnitude of aquila  x-1 .    under normal viewing conditions at ctio",
    ", it is extremely difficult to separate the true optical counterpart of aquila  x-1  from the bright contaminating star",
    ". therefore the magnitudes reported in this work are the combined magnitudes of the aquila  x-1  system and the contaminating star , and when we say magnitude of aquila  x-1   we actually mean the combined magnitude of aquila  x-1  and the contaminating star . in quiescence ,",
    "light from the contaminating star dominates , but once an outburst begins , photons from aquila  x-1  dominate .",
    "the optical data reduction , including bias subtraction , overscan correction , and flat - fielding , was done through the standard iraf data reduction pipeline developed for these instruments .",
    "for the j - band near - ir data , multiple dithered frames were taken and then flat - fielded , sky subtracted , aligned and average - combined using an in - house iraf script . during a large portion of the year 2004 , one of the four quadrants of the ir ccd was not working . in most of the observations during this period , one or more of the reference stars were not present in the frames .",
    "we used whichever comparison stars were present and adjusted the resulting differential magnitudes appropriately .",
    "we used the field stars 2mass 19111739 + 0035039 and 2mass 19111633 + 0034333 with j - band magnitudes of 12.404 and 12.490 respectively , to obtain differential magnitude of the source .",
    "flux calibration of these reference stars in the r - band was performed by comparing with landolt standard stars on the photometric night of mjd 53904 ( 2006 june 18 ) . in order to estimate time variability in flux from any of the reference stars , we calculated the difference between the observed magnitudes of the reference stars on every night .",
    "smaller than 0.02 mag in r - band , this difference is the primary source of error in flux determination because during outbursts the poisson error due to photon count - rate is much smaller .",
    "the @xmath7 is even better in j - band where interstellar extinction is lesser .    for magnitude to flux conversion , following @xcite and @xcite",
    ", we assumed that r=0 magnitude converts to 3064 jy and j=0 magnitude converts to 1603 jy .",
    "@xcite estimated that @xmath8 of the quiescent r - band flux is from the contaminating star . assuming that the brightness of the contaminating star is constant in time",
    ", we subtracted this flux from the total observed flux to obtain the flux of aquila  x-1  only , during quiescence as well as outbursts .",
    "interstellar reddening and extinction was calculated assuming a hydrogen column density ( @xmath9 ) of @xmath10 atoms/@xmath11 in the direction of aquila  x-1  @xcite . from deep optical photometry and spectroscopy of the source during quiescence @xcite",
    "estimated the color excess @xmath12 which is consistent with the @xcite value of @xmath9 in the direction of aquila  x-1 . for dereddening the oir flux we used the standard @xmath9 to visual extinction ( @xmath13 )",

    "the asm has been monitoring the sky in the 1.5 - 3 , 3 - 5 and 5 - 12 kev energy bands continuously since 1996 .",
    "usually a given source is observed a few times every day , subject to constraints like angular proximity to the sun etc .",
    "the results are made publicly available by the mit / asm team through their website .",
    "we have used the one day average light curve for aquila  x-1 . during quiescence",
    ", the flux from aquila  x-1  is below the detection limit of the asm , however since we are interested only in the major outbursts , which are detectable by the asm , we did not take into account data during quiescence , for our optical - x - ray correlation study .",
    "also , during the early as well as the late stages of the outbursts , the count - rates in the individual energy channels are small ; therefore we have only looked at the summed count - rates in this work .",
    "the asm count - rates were converted to flux - density at 5.2 kev , assuming a crab - like spectrum .",
    "the crab spectrum in the asm energy range is a simple power law with a photon - index of -2.1 and the total flux within that range is @xmath20 ergs/@xmath11/s @xcite , so the flux - density at 5.2 kev is 1.06 mjy .",
    "the flux conversion ( from asm count - rate to @xmath21jy ) is therefore a numerical factor by which the total asm count rate is multiplied .",
    "the choice of 5.2 kev was motivated by the fact that it is the geometric mean of the half - transmission points of the asm response shape near 2.3 and 12 kev .",
    "we used geometric mean ( gm ) because the gm compensates for the fact that almost all x - ray spectra slope downward in count rate toward higher energies .",
    "evolution of spectral shape during an outburst introduces uncertainities in flux determination .",
    "pivoting uncertainities ( due to spectral evolution ) in asm s x - ray range are small compared to the optical to x - ray separation in frequency space .",
    "we used the online _",
    "webpimms _ tool which shows that for a given total asm count - rate , the difference in flux in the asm band - pass is less than 10% between a power law of photon index 2.1 ( i.e. crab spectrum ) , a power law of photon index 1.7 or a blackbody at 2 kev ( typical photon index / blackbody temperature of aquila  x-1  in hard / soft state ; see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore we added a 10% systematic error , in quadrature to the poisson error , during the asm count - rate to flux conversion to account for the uncertainity in the spectral shape .",
    "the precise value for pinning and rescaling the flux conversion is not very sensitive to the choice of kev reference , as long as this is done self - consistently ( i.e. scale to crab flux density at the reference kev , and implemented in this work ) .    in this process",
    ", any information about changes in the energy spectrum is lost , but we are primarily concerned with overall x - ray flux here , and using all the counts results in better signal - to - noise ratio . in order to assess the x - ray state of the source , we have used the dates of state transitions from published literature @xcite . for the most recent outbursts ( e.g. outburst # 9 , # 10 ) with",

    "in fig .  [ longterm ] we show the results of long - term multi - wavelength monitoring of aquila  x-1 .",
    "the rxte / asm monitoring of aquila  x-1  dates back to the beginning of 1996 , but our nightly r - band monitoring started on mjd 50984 ( 1998 june 20th ) .",
    "the j - band observations started mjd 51677 ( 2000 may 13th ) onwards , but the coverage was somewhat sporadic till the end of 2002 , as can be seen from the top panel of fig .",

    "sometimes make it difficult to date the precise starting and ending moments of an outburst , in table  [ tab : outburst_log ] we note the mjd when the asm , r - band and j - band fluxes attained a maximum during an outburst .",
    "we define a major outburst as a period of activity of the source , spanning at least 20 days or longer , when the source flux was at least @xmath22 above quiescence in at least one of the observed ( j , r and asm ) bandpasses .",
    "eleven major periods of activity were observed by the asm during this period .",
    "all these periods of major activity were also seen in oir , except the one during late 2005early 2006 when the source s angular proximity to the sun was too close to observe with ground based oir telescopes .",
    "even the rxte / asm data , while showing unmistakeable signs of activity during this particular outburst , does not have sufficient coverage and @xmath7 to classify the light curve morphology .",
    "besides the major outbursts , several smaller and shorter periods of activity are seen in the oir light curve ( fig .",

    "this high optical - to - x - ray flux - ratio , discussed in greater detail in  [ sec : r - asm ] , is one of the defining characteristics of a lis .",

    "given the considerable scatter in the data , we have not attempted to fit the data with any function and the flux - ratios quoted above , as shown in fig .",

    "the r@xmath27j color is determined by the temperature of the annulus and the r - band brightness is proportional to the projected area of the annulus and inversely proportional to the square of the distance to the source . since the observed brightness depends on the projected area , we multiplied the area of a disk of radius @xmath29 , by a multiplicative factor @xmath30 , and used this area as the area of the annulus .",

    "_ during the course of fred and lis outbursts of aquila  x-1 the evolution of the source on the oir color - magnitude diagram  is consistent with heating / cooling of an irradiated outer accretion disk as a constant area blackbody . a classical viscous accretion disk ( e.g. a shakura - sunyaev disk ) spectrum has a frequency dependence of @xmath48 between @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the disc temperatures at the inner and outer edges of the disk . at frequencies",

    "when the break frequency between the viscous dissipation and the rayleigh - jeans regime given by @xmath57 lies between r and j bands , the spectral index should lie between @xmath37 and @xmath38 . the observed systematic and continuous change in color ( and the corresponding range in the spectral index from @xmath42 to @xmath41 ;  [ sec : colors ] ) seen in fig .",
    "[ r - j_1 ] and fig .",
    "[ r - j_2 ] is strongly suggestive of an irradiative origin for the observed oir emission and not of a purely viscous origin .    neither the oir color nor its brightness change sharply during an x - ray spectral state transition .",
    "this confirms that for aquila  x-1 the outer accretion disk , which emits most of the thermal oir radiation , is not affected by x - ray spectral state transitions which change the physical environment of the inner regions of the accretion disk .",
    "this is in sharp contrast with black hole  binaries like 4u 1543 - 47 , gx 339 - 4 @xcite where near ir colors are strongly correlated with x - ray state changes and the correlation interpreted as evidence for non - thermal emission . in freds ,",
    "a slow increase in brightness above that predicted by our constant area blackbody  model , as the source becomes bluer and brighter , is most likely due to increase in the surface area of the disk ( e.g most prominent for outburst # 2 and # 5 in fig .",
    "[ aql - cmd1 ] ) .",
    "it is possible that at highest mass accretion rates the high x - ray flux from the central inner disk causes the flaring of the outer disk and hence increase the effective surface area .",
    "in contrast , during the liss , when the source probably spends the whole period of activity in hard x - ray state , there does not seem to be any significant change in the disk area ( e.g. outburst # 7 in fig .",
    "[ aql - cmd2 ] ) .",
    "therefore it is likely that the effect of x - ray state transition on the outer accretion disk is both an increase of the outer disk temperature due to enhanced irradiation from the inner disk and an increase in the emitting area of the outer disk due to flaring .",
    "total irradiation ( hence oir flux ) is a bit smaller in lis than in peak fred .",
    "this could be due either to lower @xmath0 , or to radiative inefficiency lowering @xmath58 ratio .",
    "_ broad band quasi - simultaneous observations in lis suggest outflow . _",
    "soft x - ray flux is very low in lis , but hard x - rays are high ( * ? ? ?",
    "* linares et al . in preparation , ) . while absence of soft , thermal x - ray photons suggests that the inner edge of the accretion disk is cold and probably receded during the lis , the high oir brightness ( see fig .",
    "[ allfluxes ] for the dramatic difference in @xmath59 between lis and fred outbursts ) as well as type i x - ray bursts suggests that a significant amount of mass is being accreted by the outer accretion disk and fed to the inner region .",
    "radio detection of the source during lis @xcite with flat spectral slope hints toward a jet outflow .",
    "however , since the evolution of the source on oir color - magnitude diagram  is consistent with irradiation , it can be concluded that the jet , if present , is either quite weak in terms of the input power , or the transition from optically thick to optically thin jet emission occurs at a wavelength much longer than j - band .",
    "current models for jets from compact systems suggest that this might imply a large jet launching area or the jet base , or much weaker particle acceleration @xcite .",
    "thus our observations support the current hypothesis that jet - luminosity is not significant in most neutron star x - ray binary systems @xcite .",
    "_ a possible scenario for the lis might be that an @xmath0   that would ordinarily be high enough to move the disk inwards , and thus trigger a soft state , somehow does nt do that , and launches an outflow instead .",
    "_ thus the standard processes associated with the dim are disrupted by the absence of an inner disk in this high @xmath0  state .",
    "if the accretion flow in the inner region in a lis is radiatively inefficient , it can drive the observed outflow , as suggested by recent theoretical works ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
