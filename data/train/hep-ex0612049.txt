    "totem is an experiment dedicated to the measurement of the proton  proton total cross section ( @xmath0 ) at lhc , i.e. the probability that two protons interact at the center of mass energy of 14 tev .",
    "in addition to that , it will also study the proton  proton elastic scattering and diffractive dissociation processes .",
    "totem foresees specific measurements and experimental techniques which are very different from the other ` general purpose ' experiments at lhc .",
    "a precise ` luminosity independent ' measurement of @xmath0 will be achievable in special beam optics runs by simultaneously measuring : 1 ) the elastic scattering rate at low transfer momentum , possibly as small as @xmath1 gev@xmath2 , and 2 ) the inelastic scattering rate with the largest possible coverage to reduce losses to few percents .",
    "the first goal requires detectors located into units mounted into the vacuum chamber of the accelerator , called roman pots ( rps ) , as the scattered protons are emitted at angles of the order of 10  @xmath3rad , therefore without leaving the beam  pipe .",
    "the latter requires the measurement of all the inelastically produced particles in the very forward direction with respect to the @xmath4 collision point ; this can be achieved by using tracking detector telescopes with a complete azimuthal coverage around the beam  pipe .    in the following ,",
    "a brief description of the experimental apparatus is given .",
    "more details can be found in @xcite .",
    "i will then discuss physics issues such as the measurement of @xmath0 and the validation of hadronic shower models used in cosmic ray physics .",
    "the experimental setup comprises roman pot detectors to measure the leading protons at @xmath5  147 and 220 meters from the lhc interaction point ip5 , while the inelastic telescopes t1 and t2 are located inside the cms end ",
    "caps around the beam  pipe , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cmsbello ] . note also the planned forward calorimeter castor , under cms s responsibility , with the same acceptance of the t2 detector .",
    "rapidity gaps and forward particle flows could be measured by the totem telescopes t1 and t2 , while forward energy flows could be measured by t2 and the cms castor forward calorimeter .",
    "each rp station has two units 4 m apart , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : station ] .",
    "each unit has two vertical pots approaching the beam from the top and the bottom , where beams are usually more stable , and one lateral pot sensitive to diffractive protons .",
    "furthermore , the overlap between the horizontal and the vertical pots ( fig .",
    "[ fig : overlap ] ) will serve for measuring the relative distance of the vertical detectors .",
    "each pot will contain 5 + 5 planes of silicon detectors , their strips having orientations of @xmath6 w.r.t . the detector edge , and a pitch of 66 @xmath3 m .",
    "+ in order to optimize the measurement of microscopic proton scattering angles , the rp detector edge has to move as close to the beam as @xmath71  mm and , therefore , the edge dead area has to be greatly minimized .",
    "a new edgeless technology of silicon microstrips has been developed , where a current terminating structure will reduce to only 50 @xmath3 m the decoupling area between edge and sensitive volume .",
    "strong magnetic dipoles between the rp stations will provide a powerful magnetic spectrometer .",
    "particle momenta will be measured with an accuracy of a few parts per thousand , allowing an accurate determination of the momentum loss of quasi  elastically scattered protons in diffractive processes .",
    "the t1 telescopes on both sides of the interaction point will cover the pseudorapidity range @xmath8 .",
    "it will consist of five planes , each composed of six trapezoidal cathode strip chambers ( csc ) .",
    "each detector will measure three projections : one set of anode wires with a pitch of 3 mm measuring the radial coordinate and two sets of cathode strips with a pitch of 5 mm , rotated by @xmath9 with respect to the wires .",
    "the radial measurement will provide level-1 trigger information and will be used for vertex reconstruction in order to suppress beam - gas background .",
    "beam tests of final prototypes have shown a spatial resolution of 0.36 mm in the radial and 0.62 mm in the azimuthal coordinate .    for t2 , which extends the acceptance into the range @xmath10 , the gas electron multiplier ( gem ) technology as used successfully in compass  @xcite has been chosen .",
    "gems are gas - filled detectors in which the charge amplification structure is decoupled from the charge collection and readout structure .",
    "furthermore , they combine good spatial resolution with very high rate capability and a good resistance to radiation . the t2 telescope will be placed 13.5 m away from the ip5 and the gems employed will have an almost semicircular shape , with an inner radius matching the beam pipe .",
    "each half  arm of t2 will have a set of 10 aligned detector planes mounted ` back - to - back ' on each side of the vacuum pipe ( fig .",
    "[ fig : t2 ] ) . to avoid efficiency losses ,",
    "the angular coverage of each half plane is more than 180@xmath11 .",
    "the read - out boards will have two separate layers with different patterns : one with 256 concentric circular strips , 80@xmath3 m wide and with a pitch of 400@xmath3 m , and the other with a matrix of pads varying in size from @xmath12 to @xmath13 ( for a constant @xmath14 ) .",
    "the pad information will also provide level-1 trigger information .",
    "a final prototype has been successfully tested in the 2004 test - beam .",
    "the read - out of all totem detectors will be based on the digital vfat chips , enhancing the system uniformity from the point of view of the data processing chain .",
    "[ fig : sigmapp ] shows recent predictions  @xcite for the energy dependence of the total @xmath4 cross section @xmath0 by fitting all available data .",
    "the black error band shows the statistical errors to the best fit , the closest curves near it give the sum of statistical and systematic errors to the best fit due to the ambiguity in the tevatron data , and the highest and lowest curves show the total error bands from all models considered . for the lhc energy a value @xmath15 mb",
    "is obtained from the best fit , while the total error band ranges in the 90130 mb interval .",
    "this large theoretical uncertainty is due to the current lack of a fully satisfactory theoretical explanation of the cross section in low momentum transfer collisions , and their description relies on phenomenological models .",
    "totem aims to measure @xmath0 with a precision of 1% or 1 mb , therefore discriminating among the different models .",
    "the typical instantaneous luminosity for the totem @xmath0 measurement will be of the order of 10@xmath16 .",
    "this is due to the high machine optics @xmath17 value - 1540 m for the 1% measurement - required in special runs in order to keep as small as possible the beam angular divergence for a precise measurement of small scattering angles . as a consequence , the beam size at the interaction point increases",
    "therefore , in order to avoid extra interactions between the colliding beams inside the common vacuum chamber , a small number of bunches as well as a zero crossing angle are desirable , resulting in the forementioned luminosity for an optics with @xmath18 1540 m and 43 bunches .",
    "a special beam optics with @xmath18 90 m ( and a luminosity close to 10@xmath19 ) , still enabling a @xmath0 measurement with a few percent uncertainty , would also provide an excellent measurement of the momentum loss of diffractive protons , opening the studies of soft and semihard diffraction , the latter in combination with the cms detectors .    without an accurate measurement of the machine luminosity , the only practical way to determine @xmath0 is the ` luminosity independent ' method which combines the total rate equation , as the sum of elastic and inelastic interactions , to the optical theorem relation between @xmath0 , luminosity and the imaginary part of the forward amplitude , such that the luminosity is eliminated and @xmath0 can be written as a function of measurable rates : @xmath20 where the optical point at @xmath21 has to be extrapolated from the measurement of the elastic scattering at low momentum transfers .",
    "let s consider the measurement with the special @xmath18 1540 m optics .",
    "the statistical error on the extrapolation of the elastic cross section at @xmath21 is less than 0.1% already after 10 hours of data taking .",
    "the systematic error is dominated by the insufficient knowledge at very low @xmath22 of the functional form for the extrapolation , and it will be less than 0.5% if angles as low as 14@xmath3rad - equivalent to about @xmath23 gev@xmath2 - could be measured , well within the experiment expectations .",
    "elastic events will be selected by a double  arm trigger , with a signal from left amd right rps , plus the collinearity of the two protons .",
    "the vertex reconstruction will help eliminating the background from beam  gas and beam halo events .",
    "in addition to that , the selection of inelastic events will include a single  arm trigger in coincidence with a leading proton in the opposite side rp for the single diffractive events .",
    "single diffractive events with masses below 10 gev will fail the trigger , but the resulting loss can be corrected .",
    "this is estimated to give the largest contribution to the total error on the total rate measurement which is about 0.8% .",
    "the sum of all uncertainties results in an error of about 1% on @xmath0 .",
    "an important measurement to understand the mechanism of high energy collisions is the ratio of the elastic over total cross sections , which in the past was found to increase with energy at cern and fermilab . among several phenomenological models ,",
    "the one by bourelly , soffer and wu  @xcite foresees for instance that , at very high energies , the effective interaction radius of the colliding hadrons increase as log@xmath24 , @xmath25 increase as log@xmath26 and @xmath27 approach 1/2 . at lhc energy ,",
    "the elastic cross section is supposed to be about 30  mb . to discriminate between different models",
    "it is thus important to precisely measure the elastic scattering over the largest possible @xmath22 region . the @xmath22 distribution assuming the bsw model is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigmael ] .",
    "it extends over 11 orders of magnitude and has therefore to be measured with different optics settings .",
    "the exponential fall at low @xmath22 is followed by a diffractive structure at @xmath71 gev@xmath2 and continues to large @xmath22-values where perturbative calculations suggest a power ",
    "law behaviour ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "the number of events at the right side of the plot refers to a day running at two conditions ( optics with special @xmath29 1540 m and injection @xmath29 18 m , respectively ) .",
    "the maximal detectable @xmath22-value due to aperture limitations in the lhc is 8 gev@xmath2 with @xmath29 18  m.    while the measurement of the total cross section and the elastic scattering can be performed using only totem detectors , the integration of totem into the general purpose detector cms offers the prospect of more detailed studies of diffractive events .",
    "the totem triggers , combining information from the inelastic detectors and the silicon detectors in the rps , can be incorporated into the general cms trigger scheme .",
    "the cms experiment extended by the totem detectors provides the largest acceptance detector ever implemented at a hadron collider .",
    "the aim of the totem experiment is to obtain accurate information on the basic properties of proton  proton collisions at the maximum accelerator energy , thus providing a significant contribution to the understanding of very high energy cosmic ray physics .",
    "primary cosmic rays in the pev ( 10@xmath30 ev ) energy range and above are a challenging issue in astrophysics .",
    "the lhc center of mass energy corresponds to a 100 pev energy for a fixed target collision in the air , at the same time providing a high event rate relative to the very low rate of cosmic particles in this energy domain .    a primary cosmic ray entering the upper atmosphere experiences a nuclear interaction , with the production of nuclear fragments and @xmath31 mesons , starting an air shower with hadronic , electromagnetic and muon components .",
    "the real challenge is to determine the nature of the primary interaction and the energy and composition of the incident particle from the measurement of the shower .",
    "several high energy hadronic interaction models are nowadays available , which predict energy flow , multiplicity and other quantities of such showers",
    ". there are large differences between the predictions of currently available models , with significant inconsistencies in the forward region .",
    "among the several quantities that can be measured by totem and cms , and compared with model predictions , are : energy flow , transverse energy , elastic / total cross section , fraction of diffractive events , particle multiplicity , ratio of the number of hadronic secondaries to that of leptonic secondaries , and the distribution of the inelasticity coefficient of the incident nucleon ( i.e. the ratio of the energy of the most energetic outgoing particle to the energy of the incident particle , it defines the shape of the shower ) .",
    "samples of events obtained with some of the available generators ( qgsjet 0.1  @xcite , sibyll 2.1  @xcite , dpmjet 3  @xcite , nexus 3  @xcite ) were passed through the simulation of t1 , t2 and castor detectors .",
    "two data samples were considered : all inelastic collisions and diffractive events .",
    "diffractive events were defined as those with a leading proton with a momentum loss @xmath32 .    as an example , figure  [ fig : cosmic - multiplicity ] shows the predictions of the quoted monte carlo generators for the charged particle multiplicity .",
    "table  [ tab : cosmic - fraction - castor ] shows the fraction of diffractive events expected in castor .",
    "significant differences in the predictions are evident .",
    "the differences are larger for the diffractive events rather than for inelastic events .",
    "appreciable differences are also observed for the inelasticity coefficient as well as for the energy flow .",
    "the study of the features of diffractive and inelastic events as measured in castor and totem may thus be used to validate / tune the generators  @xcite .",
    "totem will be ready for data taking at lhc start .",
    "the undergoing production of the final totem detectors is proceeding fine and , at the time of writing , a fraction of them is under test on the cern sps h8 beam line .",
    "the rps are foreseen to be installed in spring 2007 , while all the detectors will be ready by july 2007 .",
    "totem precise measurements of basic properties of proton  proton collisions at lhc will provide a significant contribution to the understanding of cosmic ray physics , by discriminating among currently popular shower models .",
