    "now that the higgs has been discovered , one of the highest priorities for the lhc in the next run is to find ( or place strong bounds on ) particle dark matter .",
    "the standard approach is to look for dark matter pair production as missing transverse momentum ( met ) in association with some initial state radiation .",
    "processes of that type could arise from effective operators  @xcite or uv - complete simplified models involving various types of mediators @xcite .",
    "one of the principal results from these works is that there is complementarity between the bounds from direct detection and the bounds from the various types of lhc searches for evidence of dark matter and its mediators .",
    "the simplest models contain only a few parameters : the dark matter mass , the mediator mass(es ) , and the coupling(s ) of the dark matter to one ( or more ) standard model ( sm ) field(s ) .",
    "consider the case where the dark matter is a fermion , the mediator is a scalar ( but with the @xmath3 quantum numbers of a standard model quark ) , and there is a renormalizable interaction between a light quark , the dark fermion , and the scalar mediator . while there are several constraints ,",
    "the dominant ones are  @xcite :    * direct detection for small mass splittings between the dark fermion and scalar mediator ; * jets @xmath4 met constraints from lhc for large mass splittings caused by scalar mediator production and decay to dark fermions and jets .    these constraints tend to push the dark fermion and scalar mediator masses to larger values with moderate mass splittings .",
    "however , the dark matter annihilation cross section , that sets the thermal relic abundance , scales with positive powers of the coupling multiplying _ negative _ powers of the dark fermion mass ( or scalar mediator mass  it does nt matter since their mass scales are highly correlated )",
    ". the downward march of the experimental bounds must therefore be accompanied by an upward march of the coupling constant(s ) , which in some cases , can now be @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "couplings @xmath1 provide a potential new avenue for exploration and discovery at collider experiments .",
    "namely , they open up the possibility of experimentally measurable radiative corrections of dark fermions and mediators to standard model processes .",
    "there are several types of radiative corrections that we could consider .",
    "( earlier work that has considered radiative corrections of dark matter include  @xcite ) in this paper , we focus on the radiative corrections to dilepton production at hadron colliders . for the model , we assume there is a dark fermion ( that can acquire dirac and majorana masses ) as well as scalar messengers : scalar quarks that couple to light quarks and the dark fermion with coupling strength @xmath5 , and scalar leptons that couple to leptons and the dark fermion with coupling strength @xmath6 .",
    "dilepton production is well known to be a harbinger for new physics ( np ) .",
    "new gauge bosons ( @xmath7s ) , extra dimensions , and effective operators are well known examples that have already been bounded by atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite using the shape and normalization of dilepton production as a function of the dilepton invariant mass , @xmath8 . our primary interest is the new dark sector `` box '' contributions to @xmath9 , that are proportional to @xmath10 in the amplitude , interfering with the usual drell - yan contribution from the standard model .",
    "new kinematical features in the dilepton invariant mass spectrum arise at invariant masses of twice the dark matter mass , @xmath11 , from both the real part of the new physics box amplitude as well as an imaginary part for @xmath12 . unlike a @xmath7 search , however , the box contribution does _ not _ look anything like a resonance .",
    "in fact , there can be both constructive and destructive interference effects that depend on the model and the strength of the couplings . at large , but still perturbative couplings ( roughly @xmath13 ) , we find that the @xmath14 contribution dominates .",
    "this leads to a unique monocline feature in the dilepton invariant mass .",
    "standard `` bump - hunter '' approaches are not appropriate , and could miss an otherwise observable feature in the spectrum . like",
    "a @xmath7 or extra dimension search , nontrivial contributions to the forward backward asymmetry @xmath15 are also present . unlike a @xmath7 or extra dimension search ,",
    "there is further nontrivial angular dependence that can potentially be uncovered using strategies implemented in searches for the new physics contributions to the dijet angular distribution @xcite .",
    "all of these features arise from the box function contribution to the amplitude that , we stress , can not be captured by effective four - fermion operators . instead",
    ", it is crucial to `` scan '' over finite @xmath8 to uncover the dominant features of the box contribution that appear for @xmath16 . given that we expect the mediator masses larger than but of the order of the dark matter mass ( to obtain the correct relic abundance with non - perturbative couplings ) , there is no regime where the dark matter or the mediator can be `` integrated out '' while leaving a finite signal . indeed ,",
    "one of our most important results is that the _ mass scale _ of the dark fermions appears as a kinematical feature in the radiatively corrected dilepton invariant mass distribution .",
    "this is a completely distinct approach to measuring a putative dark matter particle mass at a collider .",
    "we say `` putative '' since we still have no collider probe of the stability of the dark matter .",
    "indeed , we should emphasize that the signal we propose to look for , namely kinematical features in the dilepton invariant mass spectrum and angular distributions consistent with radiative corrections from a new `` dark '' sector , could arise from other new physics sectors that have nothing to do with dark matter . in this work we focus on one concrete dark matter model .",
    "we have organized the paper as follows .",

    "specifically , we find that the 20 fb@xmath17 8 tev dataset from lhc experiments could constrain a modest region of parameter space that , in some cases , is not yet excluded by other constraints .",
    "once the lhc goes up to 14 tev with larger luminosity , a much more substantial region of the parameter space can be probed .",

    "the total amplitude becomes the sum @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the amplitude for the crossed box diagram .",
    "importantly , @xmath77 comes with a minus sign relative to @xmath38 due to the different ordering of the external spinors .",
    "thus , the direct and crossed box diagrams interfere destructively , and we expect the new physics effects in the cross section to be much less pronounced in the majorana case than in the dirac case . in particular , we find that over large parts of the parameter space the `` monocline '' feature noticed in the dirac scenario is washed out by the destructive interference . even for sizeable couplings @xmath78 , the largest contribution to the deviation from the standard model cross section comes typically from the interference term between the tree and box amplitudes , which carries only four powers of the coupling  @xmath26 .",

    "search sets tighter constraints on model  ud  than model  u , which in turn are tighter than in model  d. the cuts used in the search get more efficient when the scalar mediator and the lsp are more split in mass .",
    "this dependence on the acceptance gives rise to the strengthening of the bounds observed as @xmath137 increases . for model  d ,",

    "hence , @xmath79 behaves entirely majorana - like for direct detection searches .",
    "next , the spin - independent ( si ) scattering bounds ( solid green curves ) are very similar for model  u  and d , but stronger for model  ud  since more partons are involved in the scattering in the latter .",
    "the spin - dependent ( sd ) bounds ( dashed green curves ) differ across all three models due to the difference in nucleon matrix elements , which are large for down quarks in a neutron and small for up quarks in a neutron ( see appendix  [ sec : ddformulae ] ) .",
    "moreover , the si constraints weaken much more rapidly than the sd bounds as we increase in @xmath137 ( and disappear for @xmath252 in the range of our parameter space ) .",
    "this is due to the dominance of the twist-2 operator in si scattering that scales as @xmath226 , as opposed to the @xmath253-dependence of sd scattering .",

    "as one can see , the dilepton spectrum features are significantly more prominent at the lhc at 14 tev , and even more so at a 100 tev future collider .",
    "this is to be expected since the number of dilepton events increases considerably both by the higher center - of - mass energy and the higher integrated luminosities , thus improving the sensitivity of a shape - fit . for the same reason , the systematic uncertainties , which were smaller than statistical uncertainties in the @xmath201 tev measurements and hence negligible in setting constraints , play a more important role in determining the sensitivities of future colliders .",
    "one also notices the difference in slope between the solid red curves and the others in the left - hand plot , and between solid and dashed curves in the right - hand plot .",
    "this is because the contributions to @xmath200 come from a wider range near @xmath278 .",

    "we anticipate some complementarity between the jets+met sensitivity and dilepton sensitivity : as @xmath137 is increased , the dilepton monocline signal is suppressed , while the jets+met signal becomes more easily visible . where the crossover occurs is undoubtedly highly sensitive to the respective detection search strategies .",
    "we have presented a simple but realistic model of pseudo - dirac fermionic dark matter that results in a qualitatively new signal in the form of kinematical and angular features in dilepton production at the lhc .",
    "the most spectacular feature is the `` monocline '' , a step - like feature with a sharp rise in the differential cross section for dilepton production occurring for a dilepton invariant mass near the sum of the dark fermion masses , @xmath279 , with a subsequent gradual falloff .",

    "pseudo - dirac fermions could arise naturally when an accidental @xmath282 symmetry that gives a dirac mass to the fermions is broken at loop level  @xcite . since a dirac fermion can be thought of as two degenerate majorana eigenstates",
    ", the effect of the small majorana mass is to introduce a splitting in the eigenmasses .",
    "if the splitting is of the order of a few gev , we obtain several desirable features . among these",
    "is that since the momentum transfer scale of direct detection experiments is @xmath283-@xmath284s of kev , such experiments are only sensitive to the lighter eigenstate ; thus , the pseudo - dirac fermion with a few - gev - splitting can be treated as a majorana fermion for direct detection .",
    "in addition , efficient @xmath31-wave coannihilation between the two eigenstates would result in a relic abundance that does not overclose the universe even for small couplings .",
    "the heavier eigenstate produced in a collider can decay to the lighter one with a displaced vertex that is measurable at the lhc . by studying the dilepton spectrum in this decay",
    ", the mass splitting can be directly measured .",
    "the decay length can also predict the mass of the lighter state if the model s relic abundance is matched with the observed value and if the mediators are heavy .",
    "the model as presented is renormalizable , and thus in principle uv complete .",
    "however , we have considered relatively large ( though perturbative ) @xmath26 couplings between the dark fermion , the scalar mediator , and a standard model quark or lepton . these couplings ,",
    "when rg evolved to higher scales , may develop landau poles .",
    "this is not in itself a concern for us since we have focused on the physics of the new particles near to their threshold production at the lhc .",
    "larger @xmath26 couplings could arise from several sources .",
    "the most logical possibility is that there is a larger set of scalar mediators , for instance scalar quark mediators that couple to the left - handed quarks , that , when summed into the box contributions , masquerade as a larger effective @xmath26 coupling with fewer mediators .",
    "another possibility is that the pseudo - dirac fermionic partner @xmath285 couples to the scalar mediators and quarks , also effectively increasing the strength of the @xmath26 couplings .",
    "the model has unmistakable similarities to simplified supersymmetric models with a bino or neutral wino as the dark matter , with the squarks and sleptons are the scalar mediators .",
    "indeed , the supersymmetric limit is interesting , since several of our otherwise arbitrary assumptions ( coupling of just @xmath286 to the scalar mediator and quarks ) could arise naturally in a supersymmetric context .",
    "the main impediment is that an observable feature in dilepton production requires @xmath287 by a factor of perhaps @xmath288 ",
    "@xmath289 times what would have otherwise been required by ( at least unbroken ) supersymmetry .",
    "this is intriguingly reminiscent of the higgs quartic coupling , which is related to the electroweak couplings at tree - level , but in fact must be significantly larger to accommodate the observed value of @xmath290  gev .",
    "an interesting question for future exploration is to understand what could be possible from supersymmetry breaking corrections to increase the size of the quark - squark - neutral gaugino coupling .",
    "we have not considered flavor - violation in the model , but this too could be interesting , especially if the dilepton signal was also accompanied by some fraction of @xmath291 events ( that would also exhibit a feature in their @xmath58 spectrum ) .",
    "we did not consider flavor - violation in this paper for two reasons : one is that it obviously would not interfere with sm drell - yan production , which was our primary motivation .",
    "second , we would necessarily be forced into considering additional lepton - flavor - violating constraints , which are likely to be highly constraining . for a discussion of quark flavor constraints on models similar to ours",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "the scalar quark mediator will necessarily have box contributions to the dijet signal as well .",
    "unfortunately , our estimates of the size of this radiative correction are that it is much too small to lead to an observable monocline signal in the dijet spectrum .",
    "this is because the box contribution arises in the partonic process @xmath292 whereas the dominant dijet production involves @xmath293 as well as gluon mediated processes , which are much more significant given the associated pdf enhancements . to get",
    "a signal that could compete with qcd strength would require @xmath26 couplings much larger than required for dilepton production , and this suggests that a perturbative analysis is no longer possible .    in summary , we encourage atlas and cms to explore the sensitivity of features in the dilepton kinematic and angular spectrum for extracting dark matter signals !",
