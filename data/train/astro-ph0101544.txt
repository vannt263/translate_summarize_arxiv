    "<S> the influence of a dark component on the first epoch of galaxy formation is analysed by using the ages of the three oldest high - redshift galaxies known in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> our results , based on a spatially flat accelerated universe driven by a  quintessence \" component ( @xmath0 ) , show that if the inferred ages of these objects are correct the first formation era is pushed back to extremely high redshifts . for the present best - fit quintessence model ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) </S>",
    "<S> , we find a lower bound of @xmath3 , whereas in the extreme case of @xmath4cdm model ( @xmath5 ) the limit is slightly smaller ( @xmath6 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the case for open cold dark matter models ( ocdm ) has also been discussed . for @xmath7 , </S>",
    "<S> the formation redshift is restricted by @xmath8 . as a general result , </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath9 , these galaxies are not formed in frw cosmologies with no dark energy since for all these cases @xmath10 .    </S>",
    "<S> # 1#2=#1 # 1#2=#1 # 1#2=#1 # 1#2=#1    _ accepted for publication in apjl _    in the last decade , the remarkable observational progress in addressing the question of the origin , early evolution and ages of galaxies , as well as the expected rapid improvement of these data coming from the next generation of space telescopes may provide the key for a precise determination of the epoch when the most of galaxies in the universe were formed .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , different groups ( stockton _ et al _ 1995 ; dunlop _ et al _ 1996 ; spinrard _ et al _ 1997 ; dunlop 1998 ) announced the discoveries of three extremely red radio galaxies at @xmath11 ( 3c 65 ) , @xmath12 ( lbds 53w091 ) and @xmath13 ( lbds 53w069 ) with a minimal stellar age of 4.0 gyr , 3.5 gyr and 4.0 gyr , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these discoveries accentuated even further the already classical `` age crisis '' and gave rise to a new variant of this problem , which could be named the high-@xmath14 time scale crisis : the underestimated ages of these galaxies contradict the predictions of the standard einstein - de sitter model for values of @xmath15 ( krauss 1997 ) . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , for @xmath4cdm scenarios , the age - redshift relation for these ohrgs requires @xmath16 if the universe is assumed to be spatially flat ( alcaniz & lima 1999 ; lima & alcaniz 2000a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the problem raised by the ages of these galaxies to the standard cdm model suggests that ohrgs may be an important piece of the missing information related to the galaxy formation process , and in a similar vein , may constrain the epoch when the first structures were actually formed .    </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , recent measurements of some type ia supernovae at intermediate and high redshifts ( riess _ et al _ 1998 ; perlmutter _ et al _ 1999 ) also indicate that the bulk of energy in the universe is repulsive and appears like a  quintessence \" component , that is , an unknown form of dark energy ( in addition to the ordinary cdm matter ) probably of primordial origin ( see also turner 2000 for a review ) . together with the observations of cmb anisotropies ( de bernardis 2000 ) , these results provide the remaining piece of information connecting the inflationary flatness prediction ( @xmath17 ) with the astronomical observations . </S>",
    "<S> this state of affairs has stimulated the interest for more general models containing an extra component describing this dark energy , and simultaneously accounting for the present accelerated stage of the universe . in the last years , the absence of a convincing evidence on the nature of the dark component gave origin to an intense debate and mainly to theoretical speculations . </S>",
    "<S> some possible candidates for  quintessence \" are : a vacuum decaying energy density , or a time varying @xmath4-term ( ozer & taha 1987 ; freese 1987 ; carvalho _ et al _ 1992 ) , a relic scalar field ( peebles & ratra 1988 ; frieman _ et al _ 1995 ; caldwell _ et al _ 1998 ; saini _ et al _ 2000 ) or still an extra component , the so - called  x - matter \" , which is simply characterized by an equation of state @xmath18 , where @xmath19 ( turner & white 1997 ; chiba _ et al _ 1995 ; lima & alcaniz 2000b ) and includes , as a particular case , models with a cosmological constant ( @xmath4cdm ) ( turner _ et al _ 1984 ; peebles 1984 ; krauss & turner 1995 ) . for  x - matter \" models , constraints from large scale structure ( lss ) and cosmic microwave background anisotropies ( cmb ) complemented by the sn ia data , require @xmath20 and @xmath2 ( @xmath21 c.l . ) for a flat universe ( perlmutter _ et al _ 1999 ; efstathiou 1999 ; garnavich _ et al _ 1998 ) , while for universes with arbitrary spatial curvature the limit is @xmath22 ( efstathiou 1999 ) .    in this _ </S>",
    "<S> letter _ we focus our attention on this kind of `` quintessence '' or x - matter cosmology . as is widely known , </S>",
    "<S> because of their generality these models also merit a broader discussion . in principle , to check the validity of a theory or model ( for instance , @xmath4cdm model ) , it is interesting to insert it in a more general framework , herein quantified by the @xmath23 parameter . in this context </S>",
    "<S> , we derive new lower limits to the formation redshift @xmath24 from ages of the oldest high redshift objects known in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> the main consequences of this approach for the standard open frw model ( ocdm ) are also briefly analysed .    for passively evolving elliptic radio galaxies , </S>",
    "<S> almost all amount of gas is believed to be processed into stars in a single episode of star formation , in such a way that the assumption of an instantaneous burst is considered a good approximation for modeling their evolution ( jimenez _ et al _ 1999 ) . </S>",
    "<S> for lookback time calculations , the hypothesis of an instantaneous burst of star formation means that the age of these ohrgs can be expressed as being almost exactly the time taken by the universe to evolve from @xmath24 to the observed redshift @xmath25 . in the framework of flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) </S>",
    "<S> models with nonrelativistic matter plus a quintessence component ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) such condition can be translated as @xmath28 where @xmath29 stands for the present - day quintessence density parameter . </S>",
    "<S> the inequality signal on the r.h.s . of </S>",
    "<S> the above expression comes from the fact that the universe is older than or at least has the same age of any observed structure . </S>",
    "<S> since this natural argument also holds for any time interval , a finite value for the redshift @xmath24 provides the lower bound for the galaxy formation allowed by the aged object located at @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> models for which @xmath30 are clearly incompatible with the existence of the specific galaxy , being ruled out in a natural way . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , as argued by peebles ( 1989 ) , any model is already in trouble if @xmath24 is bigger than the finite redshift for which the mean density of the universe was equal to the mean density of the aged high redshift galaxy ( null contrast density ) .    before discussing the resulting diagrams , an important point of principle should be stressed . to assure the robustness of the limits on @xmath24 , we addopt ( 1 ) the minimal value for the hubble parameter , and ( 2 ) the underestimated age for all ohrgs . both conditions are almost self - explanatory . </S>",
    "<S> first , as we know , the smaller the value of @xmath31 , the larger the age predicted by the model and , second , objects with smaller ages are theoretically more easily accommodated , thereby guaranteeing that the models are always favored in the present estimates . for the hubble parameter we consider the value obtained by the hst key project which is in agreement with other independent estimates ( giovanelli _ et al _ 1997 ) , i.e. , the round number value @xmath32 ( freedman 1998 ) . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , we are being rather conservative since this lower limit was recently updated to nearly @xmath33 of accuracy ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 ) by freedman ( 2000 ) , and the data from sne also point consistently to @xmath36 or even higher ( riess _ et al _ 1998 ; perlmutter _ et al _ 1999 ) .    at this point </S>",
    "<S> , some few words concerning the ages of these galaxies and their consequences are also appropriate . </S>",
    "<S> since its discovery , the age estimates for the lbds 53w091 ( at @xmath37 ) has stimulated considerable debate and controversy in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> initially , by analyzing the strong transition breaks existing in the spectrum at 2640@xmath38 and 2900@xmath38 , dunlop _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> ( 1996 ) and spinrad _ et al _ ( 1997 ) found a best fitting age of 3.5 gyr . </S>",
    "<S> later on , bruzual & magris ( 1997 ) and yi _ et al _ </S>",
    "<S> ( 2000 ) , using different arguments , claimed to have derived an age as young as 1.5 gyr . </S>",
    "<S> more recently , we witnessed a new chapter on this controversy . through a more detailed analysis of the different evolution models ( based on @xmath39 minimization ) , the minimum age of 3.0 gyr </S>",
    "<S> has again been clearly favored ( nolan _ et al _ 2001 ) . for the radio galaxy 3c 65 at @xmath40 , </S>",
    "<S> we adopt the estimated age from the analysis by stockton _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> ( 1995 ) which has indicated strong evidence for a minimum stellar age of 4.0 gyr . </S>",
    "<S> however , as we shall see , since the redshift of this galaxy is comparatively low , the corresponding constraint on the first epoch of formation is the less restrictive one . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the remaining galaxy ( lbds 53w069 , @xmath13 ) is an even redder galaxy which is 1.0 gyr older than 53w091 , and whose inferred age seems to be essentially unchanged for different solar metallicity models ( nolan _ et al _ 2001 ) . </S>",
    "<S> actually , for a given value of @xmath41 , the tighter constraints on @xmath24 come from this object .    in figure 1 </S>",
    "<S> we show the @xmath42 plane allowed by the existence of these ohrg s for quintessence models . in order to have a bidimensional plot one needs to fix the value of one of the parameters ( @xmath29 or @xmath23 ) . </S>",
    "<S> here we use the observational limits from lss+cmb+sne ia , i.e. , @xmath43 and @xmath2 at @xmath21 c.l . </S>",
    "<S> ( perlmutter _ et al _ 1999 ; efstathiou 1999 ; see also wang _ et al _ 2000 for limits from  concordance cosmic \" method ) . </S>",
    "<S> this constraint is represented by the shadowed horizontal region and is used to determine the lower limits on @xmath24 . since the effect of the equation of state associated to the quintessence component ( @xmath44 ) is to accelerate the cosmic expansion , this means that the lookback time between @xmath25 and @xmath24 is larger than in the standard scenario and , therefore , the galaxy formation process may start relatively late in comparison to the corresponding standard cdm model . for example , for the interval considered here ( @xmath45 ) </S>",
    "<S> the estimated age of the 3c 65 , 53w091 and 53w069 provides , respectively , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , with the lower values of @xmath24 corresponding to the lower @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> these lower bounds are also heavily dependent on the hubble parameter . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , on the interval @xmath49 , the formation redshift for the best - fit quintessence model ( @xmath50 , @xmath2 ) ( turner & white 1997 ; perlmutter _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ 1999 ; efstathiou 1999 ; garnavich _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ 1998 ) varies from @xmath3 to @xmath51 when the age of the lbds 53w069 is considered . naturally , </S>",
    "<S> if the inferred ages of these oghrs were smaller , the corresponding formation redshifts should be relatively smaller ( for fixed values of the other parameters ) in comparison with the limits derived . </S>",
    "<S> for example , by taking the estimated age for the lbds 53w091 given by bruzual & magris ( 1997 ) and yi _ et al _ ( 2000 ) , i.e. , @xmath52 gyr , the formation redshift is reduced from @xmath53 to @xmath54 for the interval of parameters considered above . </S>",
    "<S> however , if the age of this object is greater than 2.5 gyr ( j. s. dunlop , private communication ) the corresponding lower bound is @xmath55 .    </S>",
    "<S> figures 2 and 3 display the @xmath56 plane for ocdm and @xmath4cdm models , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the shadowed horizontal region corresponds to the observed range @xmath57 ( dekel _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ 1997 ) , which is also used to fix the lower limits on @xmath24 . as should be physically expected , in the case of ocdm models ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) , if the matter contribution increases , a larger value of @xmath24 is required in order to account for the existence of these ohrgs within these models . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , for each object , the absolute minimal value of @xmath24 is obtained for an empty universe ( @xmath58 ) . in the observed range of @xmath41 </S>",
    "<S> the allowed values for the formation redshift are unexpectedly high . </S>",
    "<S> for example , </S>",
    "<S> by considering @xmath59 , as indicated from dynamic estimates on scales up to about 2@xmath60 mpc ( calberg _ et al _ 1996 ) , the ages of 3c 65 , 53w091 and 53w069 provide , respectively , @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> such values suggest that these galaxies were formed about 12.5 gyr ago , or by considering the most recent lower limits for the age of the universe ( carretta _ et al _ 2000 ; krauss 2000 ) , that such objects were formed when the universe was @xmath63 1.0 gyr old . </S>",
    "<S> however , since almost all the age of the universe is at low redshifts ( @xmath64 ) , these galaxies may have been formed nearly at the same epoch , regardless of their constraints on the redshift space . </S>",
    "<S> it is also interesting to note that the value of @xmath24 is proportional to the quantity of dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> as one may check , in the limiting case of a universe dominated only by dark energy ( @xmath65 , @xmath5 ) , the lower limit is @xmath66 2 ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> tables 1 and 2 summarize the estimated values of @xmath24 for quintessence and cdm models . in the former case the matter density parameter has been fixed in its central observed value ( @xmath67 ) , with @xmath24 determined for several values of @xmath23 ( see table 1 ) . as explained before , </S>",
    "<S> since the lookback time between @xmath24 and @xmath25 increases for lower values of @xmath23 , it is physically expected that the value of @xmath24 diminishes for smaller values of @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining cases , ocdm and @xmath4cdm , are displayed for the entire observed range of the matter density parameter ( @xmath68 = 0.2 - 0.4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that for @xmath69 , the lower limit inferred from the age of 59w069 is @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> this result is consistent with recent studies based on the age - redshift relation ( alcaniz & lima 1999 ) , and means that the standard cosmological model with @xmath69 and @xmath70 is ( beyond doubt ) incompatible with the existence of this galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> our results are also in line with the claims of kashlinsky and jimenez ( 1997 ) that the galaxy 53w091 represents a very rare and unlikely event in the density field of such models . in principle </S>",
    "<S> , they also imply that quintessence models contitutes a potential alternative to conciliate the observed excess of power observed in galaxy surveys without requiring too late galaxy formation ( as it happens in @xmath4cdm models ) . </S>",
    "<S> it should be stressed that the present constraints on @xmath24 are indeed rather conservative since the lower limit on @xmath71 has been considered in all the estimates . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the inferred ages for these galaxies refers to the end of the star formation episode that dominates the spectrum and not to the first epoch of star formation in the galaxy what , therefore , provides only a lower limit to the age of the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> finally , these high limits on @xmath24 provide a new theoretical evidence that galaxies are not uncommum objects at very large redshifts , say , at @xmath72 , and also reinforce the interest on the observational search for galaxies and other collapsed objects within the redshift interval ( @xmath73 ) , which nowadays delimits the last frontier to a more complete understanding on the galaxy formation process . </S>"
