    "two decades of _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ optical / near - infrared ( nir ) observations  and more recently also ionized or molecular gas data  have unveiled a complexity of morphologies in high redshift star - forming galaxies .",
    "many @xmath3@xmath141 galaxies do not display the disk or spheroidal morphology that is observed in the majority of local galaxies but are instead characterized by giant , star - forming clumps which dominate the light profiles and result in largely asymmetric appearances @xcite .",
    "although such irregular structure has often been associated with mergers events , the use of nir , integral - field ( ifu ) spectroscopy has enabled substantial progress in the classification of high redshift galaxies and detailed kinematic analysis have revealed ordered rotational motion in a large number of these visually disturbed galaxies @xcite . the formation of giant clumps in  normal \" disk galaxies is thought to be the outcome of violent disk instability and fragmentation @xcite , developing as a consequence of the high gas fractions that are typical for distant galaxies @xcite .    in the lack of resolved kinematic data ,",
    "the distinction between merging galaxies and clumpy disks remains however an observational challenge . in this paper",
    "we show how a quantitative classification performed on resolved stellar mass maps , rather than optical or nir single - band images , can help disentangling the population of truly merging galaxies from that of clumpy disks even without available ifu observations .",
    "our approach is motivated by a number of reasons .",
    "even with the currently available second - generation instruments , obtaining reliable ifu kinematic measurements still requires major telescope time investments ( see e.g. , the kmos-3d campaign , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , techniques which can provide robust proxies for the full kinematic informations are necessary .",
    "canonical merger classification methods , however , suffer from limitations which can hamper the distinction between mergers and  normal - but - clumpy \" galaxies .",

    "* among the others ) , for example , identifies by definition physically associated systems but it can be biased against very close galaxies (  fiber collision \" ) and thus late interaction stages , namely the merger phases in which the distinction between mergers and clumpy disks becomes more hazy .",
    "close kinematic pairs would typically have a large enough separation to allow the individual morphological classification of each galaxy .",
    "another common way of identifying mergers relies on the degree of irregularity in the light distribution either through non parametric measures such as the concentration , asymmetry , clumpiness ( cas ) and gini-@xmath15 indices @xcite or through other indicators of the presence of multiple components / tidal interactions @xcite . using hydrodynamical numerical simulations ,",
    "@xcite have shown that combinations of non - parametric structural estimators ( g - a-@xmath15 ) are sensitive to the coalescence phase and thus can be used also for evolved mergers . as mentioned above , however , at @xmath16",
    "the light profiles are dominated by giant star - forming clumps even in regular disk galaxies and cas - like classification schemes applied to single - band optical / nir images typically fail in distinguishing mergers from non - interacting galaxies .",
    "while the giant @xmath17 clumps contribute to 20%-50% of the flux in resolved optical / uv or star formation rate ( sfr ) maps of @xmath14@xmath18 star - forming galaxies , they show a lower contrast with respect to the underlying disks on stellar mass maps , contributing to @xmath19 of the total mass budget @xcite .",
    "this suggests a potentially lower contamination of falsely identified mergers if measuring the aforementioned non - parametric structural indicators directly on the stellar mass maps instead of the single band images : for clumpy galaxies we expect the stellar mass maps to display a regular , centrally concentrated profile , whereas for merging galaxies multiple components will be present , with no clear central mass concentration .",
    "the exploitation of resolved mass ( and also sfr or age ) maps has become a common method of investigating the physical properties of low and high - redshift galaxies ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the goal of this paper is to assess the performance of such a classification .",
    "we mainly focus on the testing and calibrating the proposed mass - based selection of mergers and defer a more in depth discussion on the properties of mass - identified mergers to a forthcoming paper ( a. cibinel et al . in preparation ) .",
    "we use a set of mergers and isolated galaxies from the mirage simulations @xcite to quantitatively determine the efficiency and time scales probed when selecting mergers with mass - based structural parameters .",
    "although other studies have investigated the morphology of interacting galaxies in numerical simulations , the use of the mirage sample enables us to make steps forward with respect to these previous analysis .",
    "the mirage simulations suite includes in fact key physical processes that are paramount for the formation and regulation of the giant star - forming clumps and thus naturally reproduces the complexity of clump - dominated morphologies of high redshift galaxies .",
    "we then apply our classification scheme on a fiducial sample of 1.5@xmath203 galaxies in the hubble ultra deep field ( hudf , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and compare the results of our new method with the @xmath13band classification and also with previously published kinematic analyses .    specifically , the paper is organized as follows .",

    "for these galaxies no dust extinction is applied when computing the uv - based sfr and are hence imposed to lie below the main sequence . the sample considered here",
    "is mostly composed of normal ( main sequence ) , star - forming galaxies.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "we apply the new classification scheme on a sample of galaxies in the hudf field which , thanks to the availability of extremely deep observations but also medium and shallow coverage over the same area , enables us to generate high accuracy mass maps as well as to assess the impact of s / n on the classification .",
    "we briefly summarize here the sample selection criteria and the relevant information for the public data sets utilized in this study , referring the reader to the original works for further details .      to build the pixel - by - pixel mass maps and perform the analysis described in section [ sec : masslightrealgal ] , we exploited the data from several public campaigns covering the hudf area with a multi - tiered approach .",
    "for galaxies in the original hudf acs field ( 3@xmath293@xmath30 ) we generated two versions of the mass maps using either ( 1 ) the deep @xmath22/acs f435w , f606w , f775w and f850lp images from hudf @xcite combined with the @xmath22/wfc3 f105w , f125w and f160w images from the candels - deep survey @xcite , or ( 2 ) the f435w , f606w , f775w and f850lp observations from the goods survey @xcite plus the candels - deep nir photometry .    for the sub - set of galaxies in the central 2@xmath292@xmath30 region of hudf ( corresponding to the wfc3 field of view ) , we also generated a third mass map making use of the extremely deep observations available at all wavelengths : the optical hudf images and the @xmath22/wfc3 f105w , f125w , f140w and f160w coverage from the hudf09 and hudf12 surveys @xcite .",
    "we specifically employed the mosaics provided by the hudf12 team which are combined with the hudf09 datasets . in all cases ,",
    "candels observations are also used for the f814w filter .",
    "the identification of the galaxy sample and the calculation of photometric redshifts ( photo-@xmath3 ) are based on the @xmath21-band selected , multi - wavelength catalog published by the candels team in the goods - s field ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the photometric data available in this compilation consists of imaging in 17 medium and broad - band filters ranging from the @xmath31-band to the irac @xmath32 channel .",
    "we derived photo-@xmath3 and integrated galaxy stellar masses for all galaxies in the @xcite sample as described in full details in @xcite .",
    "briefly , photo-@xmath3 were estimated from the @xcite photometric catalog using the public code eazy @xcite and a combination of the standard set of templates from @xcite .",
    "these photo-@xmath3 reach an accuracy of @xmath33 .",
    "published spectroscopic redshifts ( spec-@xmath3 ) are available for about 30% of our final hudf sample . from several spectroscopic surveys which have covered ( also ) the hudf field . ] for galaxies with a _ secure _ spectroscopic measurement we considered the spec-@xmath3 as the final redshift , whereas the photo-@xmath3 was preferred in those cases in which only a tentative ( or no spec-@xmath3 ) is given .",
    "we then obtained galaxies stellar masses through fitting of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) with fast @xcite , keeping the redshift fixed and using a set of @xcite stellar population models with delayed exponentially declining star formation histories .",
    "dust absorption with a maximum of @xmath34 was allowed in the fitting @xcite .",
    "the initial galaxy sample was extracted from the @xcite catalog by selecting galaxies over the hudf area having a spectroscopic or photometric redshift between 1.5@xmath6@xmath3@xmath63 and an @xmath21-band magnitude brighter than @xmath21@xmath626 mag .",
    "the redshift selection allows us to probe the rest - frame fuv to optical for all galaxies ; the luminosity cut is instead applied to ensure that a minimum signal - to - noise is reached in most pass - bands and thus a reliable photo-@xmath3 estimate can be obtained .",
    "the exact value of @xmath21@xmath626 mag was chosen empirically by requiring that 80% of all goods - s galaxies , within the same redshift bin as the one here considered , have a s / n@xmath83 in at least 10 of the pass - bands which are used in the photo-@xmath3 calculation .",
    "this magnitude threshold also ensures that the sample lies comfortably above the 50% completeness limit of the parent @xcite photometric catalog ( @xmath21=26.6 ) .",
    "the @xmath13band magnitude limit translates into a redshift dependent mass completeness threshold . for a clear selection of the sample",
    ", we hence apply a further cut in stellar mass to include only galaxies above the completeness value .",
    "given that we are mostly interested in studying the properties of clump - dominated , star - forming galaxies , we consider in the following the mass completeness limit for star - forming galaxies .",
    "to derive this threshold we followed the procedure described in e.g. , @xcite .",
    "for each galaxy we estimated the mass @xmath35 that it would have , keeping its mass - to - light ratio constant , if faded to the limiting magnitude @xmath3626 .",
    "we then calculated , at each redshift , the mass below which lie 90% of @xmath35 in the 30% faintest galaxies  considered to be representative of the typical @xmath37 of a galaxy close to the magnitude limit .",
    "the final completeness limit is set by the highest redshift here considered ( @xmath3=3 ) , corresponding to a value of @xmath38 for star - forming galaxies .",
    "the equivalent number for quiescent galaxies would be @xmath39 .",
    "after also rejecting galaxies which fall too close to the hudf edges for reliable measurements , our initial sample includes 132 galaxies with 1.5@xmath6@xmath3@xmath63 , h@xmath626 and m@xmath40 .",
    "we derived structural parameters for all these galaxies and we provide them in table [ tab : sampleprop ] , but the sample is further restricted for our final analysis as a result of the reliability assessment of the stellar mass maps that we present in section [ sec : biases ] and which is based on tests performed on this initial , larger sample .    while deferring to a forthcoming paper the detailed analysis of the star formation properties of mass - selected mergers , we show in figure [ fig : f1 ] the position of this initial sample of 132 galaxies on the mass versus sfr plane for illustration purposes . even above the mass completeness limit for quenched galaxies ,",
    "the majority of the galaxies here considered lie on the locus of the so - called main sequence of star formation . the few galaxies with very low sfr ( sfr@xmath411@xmath42yr@xmath43 )",
    "have been identified as quiescent from a combination of their @xmath27 colors or @xmath44 colors ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the constraints coming from their ir flux upper limits .",
    "these galaxies are by definition forced to lie below the main sequence by imposing no dust extinction in the calculation of the uv - based sfr .",
    "our sample is thus representative of the typical population of @xmath45 star - forming galaxies .",
    "a summary of the properties for the full sample of 132 galaxies and the classification into mergers and non - interacting galaxies from the stellar mass map analysis is given in table [ tab : sampleprop ] .",
    "as a first step for the generation of the resolved mass maps , we registered all the acs and wfc3 tiles to the same resolution and pixel scale of the @xmath21-band which has the worst point - spread function ( psf ) among the other available filters ( @xmath50.@xmath46 ) .",
    "to do so , we created an individual psf for each filter by stacking several unsaturated stars in the hudf field and computed the convolution kernels to match the psf of the @xmath21-band psf varies slightly across the field of view and this effect could be taken into account by selecting for each object a nearby star instead of using a common psf for the entire field",
    ". however , we estimate that the error introduced by using a single psf is comparable with the uncertainty associated to noise effects when using individual stars . ] . from the matched images",
    ", we then extracted postage stamps for each galaxy in our sample with a size equal to 3 times the @xmath21-band kron radius and , as further justified in section [ sec : mergerdefinition ] , we cleaned from the stamps any nearby companion galaxy with a known spec- or photo-@xmath3 .    to derive pixel - based stellar masses and the actual mass maps , we extracted pixel - by - pixel seds within an elliptical aperture equal to the galaxy @xmath13band kron semi - major axis and fitted them with stellar population models . given the relatively low flux in each individual pixel , some degree of smoothing or binning is required to ensure a minimum s / n on most of the filters and thus obtain reliable parameters from the pixel sed fitting .",
    "several approaches have been used in the literature to deal with s / n homogenization problems @xcite .",
    "we opted here for the publicly available code adaptsmoothzibetti / software / adaptsmooth.html ] developed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "whenever the s / n falls below a given threshold , this algorithm performs an adaptive smoothing of the images by replacing the original pixel values with an average of the galaxy flux over larger and larger circular areas as the s / n decreases .",
    "adaptsmooth features two useful options : ( a ) the smoothing of several images on the same scale lengths  necessary to derive self - consistent seds ",
    "can be easily performed and ( b ) the pixel identity is maintained , as opposed to binning schemes in which neighboring pixels are assigned a common value , effectively grouping them together into a final  macro pixel \" .",
    "results of the tests performed on the toy - model mass profiles to assess the ability of reconstructing the stellar mass distribution . for all models falling in any region of the the size ( kron radius normalized to psf ) versus @xmath13band magnitude plane marked by the horizontal and vertical dashed lines , we calculated the median absolute residual ( @xmath47 ) and the dispersion ( @xmath48 ) between input and reconstructed mass maps .",
    "the region boundaries are selected such to have at least 5 models in each bin .",
    "areas where @xmath47 ( solid , 45 degrees cw shading ) or @xmath48 ( dashed , 45 degrees ccw shading ) are low are colored in green , whereas a red color indicates systematic shifts and large scatter around the input models , i.e. , a high uncertainty in the derivation of the mass maps .",
    "the colorbars at the top of the figure provide the mapping between colors and the absolute values of @xmath47 and @xmath48 , in dex .",
    "the figure refers to models created to reproduce the typical depth of the optical hudf and candels - deep nir data , which is in between the three combinations of photometry here explored ( see section [ sec : archivaldata]).,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the choice of the reference band(s ) defining the smoothing kernels applied by adaptsmooth is a trade - off between attaining the best s / n and maintaining spatial resolution : using the band with the lowest s / n will obviously degrades the resolution , while referring to the one with the highest s / n will likely result in noisy seds .",
    "furthermore , also in the light of forthcoming analyses on the comparison between the resolved mass and sfr distribution , we are interested in detecting features such as giant star - forming clumps which may be intrinsically bright in one band but have a smaller flux contrast at longer wavelengths .",
    "a too broad smoothing on the red band may completely erase these structures in the blue filters .",
    "after testing single or multiple bands smoothing , we found the optimal configuration by running adaptsmooth on stacked images of all acs and wfc3 stamps : this ensures that the smoothing is applied on those pixels where the majority of the bands reach a low s / n while preserving the structural variations in the different filters .",
    "specifically , we run adaptsmooth by requiring a minimum s / n=5 on the stacked images and halting the adaptive smoothing when the averaging area reaches the maximum radius of 5 pixels .",
    "the smoothing pattern thus obtained was then applied to all available bands giving a median s / n@xmath55 also on the individual pixels for most filters .",
    "we note that we have tested that our results are not substantially affected by a different choice of the smoothing kernel ( e.g. , by applying the smoothing on the @xmath13band only ) .",
    "we fitted the adaptively smoothed pixel seds with lephare @xcite using the @xcite synthetic spectral library with a @xcite imf and a delayed exponential star formation history , @xmath49 .",
    "the characteristic time scale @xmath50 was let vary between 0.01 and 10gyr in 22 steps and template ages were chosen between 100myr and the age of the universe at the given redshift .",
    "we allowed three metallicity values in the fitting ( @xmath51=0.2@xmath52 , @xmath51=0.4@xmath52 and @xmath51=@xmath52 ) and furthermore applied internal dust extinction by assuming a calzetti law and @xmath53 ranging between 0 and 0.9mag .",
    "we defined our fiducial pixel mass estimate as the median mass from the full probability distribution function from all templates , but our results would remain unchanged if we had used the mass from the best - fit template ( i.e. , minimum @xmath54 ) instead . as a validation of the derived mass maps , we verified the consistency between the sum of the pixel - based masses and the integrated galaxy mass in appendix [ sec : resolved_vs_integrated ] .",
    "we find an agreement at the level of @xmath120.1 dex between the two estimates .",
    "an example of the derived mass maps is given in figure [ fig : f2 ] , where we compare the @xmath27 composite image , the @xmath13band image and the mass map for a galaxy in our sample ( i d 12451 ) .",
    "we have intentionally chosen a galaxy which displays a different structure in the @xmath13band than in the mass map to clearly illustrate how at z@xmath81 @xmath13band light and mass are not equivalent tracers of morphology .",
    "this was already pointed out by @xcite ( see for example their figure 2 which has two galaxies overlapping with our sample in figure [ fig : f11 ] ) and we will further demonstrate it in section [ sec : masslightrealgal ] .",
    "numerous studied have shown that the ability of recovering intrinsic galaxy properties from observed flux distributions depends strongly on the image s / n , resolution and even on the intrinsic properties of the galaxies themselves @xcite .",
    "our mass - based measurements will also be affected by similar limitations . for structural measurements performed on optical images , tests on artificial galaxies",
    "have demonstrated that it is possible to derive correction schemes that can largely account for the systematic biases in the estimates of galaxy structure  e.g. , galaxy radii and concentrations  for both local ( see @xcite for an application to @xmath55 galaxies from the zens sample in @xcite ) and high redshift galaxies ( see @xcite for an application to the cosmos survey , @xcite ) .",
    "we do not attempt here a derivation of similar corrections in the mass domain as this would require large suites of artificial mass maps and hence significant assumptions on the mass ( and dust ) distribution in merging and non - merging galaxies .",
    "we can nonetheless perform some tests which enable us to define the  boundaries of applicability \" of our method , i.e. the regimes where we can obtain reliable measurements .",
    "it is clear that for unresolved objects no meaningful mass reconstruction can be performed nor the individual galaxies participating in the merger can be identified .",
    "likewise , the reconstruction of the mass distribution becomes more and more difficult as the flux in the pixels reaches the surface brightness limit of the observations . to derive a global magnitude and size limit below which we can not reliably derive mass maps , we tested our sed - fitting and mass reconstruction technique on a set of artificial galaxies with known mass distribution drawn from our initial sample of 1.5@xmath6@xmath3@xmath63 .",
    "we describe these models in detail in appendix [ appendix : resolutionlimit ] . for each of the toy galaxies , we compared the mass profile reconstructed following the procedure in section [ sec : massmapsreal ] with the input model and calculated the median of the residuals as well as the typical dispersion around the input model .",
    "the results of the comparison are presented in figure [ fig : f3 ] where we color code each region of the size versus magnitude plane according to the mean absolute residual value and the dispersion of all models falling in that specific area : a red / orange color indicates high residuals / scatter in the reconstructed maps , green corresponds to low residuals / scatter .",
    "the figure illustrates how the ability of measuring reliable mass maps degrades as galaxies approach the resolution limit or reach low surface brightnesses : at sizes @xmath56psf ( roughly 15 pixels ) and magnitudes @xmath57 systematic shifts and/or large deviations from the input model affect the measured mass maps .. for observations at a different depth this limit will scale accordingly . ]",
    "we thus used the thresholds @xmath21@xmath624.5 and @xmath58@xmath85@xmath59psf to select galaxies with reliable mass maps , reducing the sample of @xmath60 galaxies to 89 objects .",
    "two of these galaxies , i d 13508 and i d 11800 , are strongly contaminated by a bright neighbor and have for this reason less robust mass maps .",
    "these cases are flagged in table [ tab : sampleprop ] and excluded from the sample used for the analysis in section [ sec : masslightrealgal ] .",
    "we show this final sample of 87 galaxies with red points in figure [ fig : f1 ] .",
    "note that the @xmath21@xmath624.5 selection is incidentally the same cut that has be applied for a reliable visual morphological classifications on the candels fields @xcite .",
    "the details on the technical aspects of the mirage simulations are presented in @xcite and further discussions on the physics implemented in these simulations can also be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "briefly , three closed - box disk models with a bulge - to - total fraction of 8% in mass and stellar masses of @xmath61 ( simulation g3 in @xcite ) , @xmath62 ( g2 ) and @xmath2 ( g1 ) were generated using an adaptive mesh refinement technique with the ramses code @xcite .",
    "these simulations reach a resolution of 7.3pc at the highest level of refinement and have initial stellar mass particles of 1.2@xmath63 and 1.7@xmath63 in the bulge and disk components , respectively .",
    "the disk galaxies were evolved in isolation or merged with each other , effectively probing merger ratios of 1:1 , 1:2.5 and 1:6.3 . in order to construct a representative sample of galaxy mergers ,",
    "four different orbital parameters were explored for each merger ratio combination , resulting in a total of 20 mergers simulations ( plus the 3 isolated disk models ) .    for each simulation configuration",
    "we utilize in the following a set of 16 snapshots separated by 40myr each , covering an epoch from 200myr to 800myr from the simulations initial conditions ; for the merger models this corresponds to follow the pre- and post - coalescence phases for roughly 300myr each ( the coalescence time is visually determined in @xcite ) .",
    "the mirage simulations feature several aspects which are paramount for a correct description of the ism physics and thus for a robust comparison with the real data .",
    "first , the high level of grid refinement enables us to resolve jeans - unstable regions within the disks , consequently we can not only model the disk fragmentation and the formation of large clumps but also properly describe outflows and heating within the giant clumps themselves .",
    "second , a physically motivated feedback model is implemented in the simulations by coupling standard supernovae feedback @xcite with the novel recipe for photoionization and radiation pressure feedback from ob - stars developed in @xcite .",
    "this feedback model reproduces the typical outflows , star formation rates and the stellar population ages ( @xmath12200myr ) observed in real clumps @xcite .",
    "third , the simulated disks have an initial total gas fraction of @xmath64 which is well representative of the observed high molecular fractions in typical @xmath16 , star - forming galaxies and is essential for the onset of gravitational instability and the generation of the giant clumps .",
    "finally , the mirage simulations were originally designed as a  numerical counterpart \" for the massiv galaxy sample @xcite , and for this reason they are tailored to high-@xmath3 galaxies in terms of global properties ( e.g. , their sizes and sfr , see figures 6 and 9 of @xcite ) .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     there is a clear trend of decreasing contamination from clumpy disks going from the @xmath3- to @xmath21-band and mass maps , supporting our approach .",
    "although in the simulations the difference between @xmath13band and mass is not statistically significant , this trend is reinforced by the results in figure [ fig : ap2 ] , showing that the contamination is minimized if the classification is performed on the mass maps also for other combinations of structural indicators .",
    "we emphasize here that as a consequence of all limitations listed in section [ sec : simscaveats ] , the simulated @xmath21-band images likely trace the mass distribution more closely than in real galaxies in which , e.g. , patchy dust obscuration or higher gas fractions , will increase the galaxy clumpiness and worsen the ability of separating mergers from disks .",
    "we hence expect that the differences between the mass - based and flux - based classification should be more pronounced in real data .",
    "this hypothesis is supported by the observational results discussed in section [ sec : masslightrealgal ] .",
    "we also note that the mass - based selection of mergers reaches a completeness level that is comparable to the @xmath13band for simulated major mergers , whereas it is somewhat lower for the minor mergers .",
    "this is not surprising since , by definition , the mass - based classification identifies galaxies with large mass contrasts / asymmetries and hence is less sensitive to minor mergers . in the simulations , some minor mergers can still be detected in the optical / nir bands as a consequence of sfr enhancements .",
    "again , in real observations the classification of these minor mergers will be further complicated by the effects discussed above .",
    "we use the results of the svm partition to define a quantitative criteria for selecting mergers based on the position in the @xmath11 and @xmath10 plane .",
    "we concluded in section [ sec : simscaveats ] that an exact one - to - one match between the relative numbers of disks and mergers in the simulations and the real data is not expected .",
    "for this reason we have refrained from performing any fine - tuning of the coefficients in the relation between @xmath11 and @xmath10 such as to optimize the completeness versus contamination level .",
    "this would in fact depend on the input merger fraction in the simulations .",
    "we rather follow the conservative approach of identifying a locus in the mass - derived @xmath11 versus @xmath10 plane which  unless real galaxies have extreme mass distributions that are not reproduced by current models  should be populated by mergers only .",
    "this is of course still model dependent , but less affected by the specific choice of the merger fraction in the simulations .",
    "our simulation - justified dividing line between mergers and normal galaxies is hence given by the following relation :    @xmath65    and it is obtained by simply applying a shift to the best svm line in the @xmath11 versus @xmath10 plane of figure [ fig : f7 ] such to exclude the most extreme disks .",
    "this relation is shown with a solid line in figure [ fig : f7 ] .",
    "the completeness level over all pre - coalescence merger snapshots ( including the unperturbed light - blue points in figure [ fig : f7 ] ) reached with the selection of equation [ eq : eq1 ] is shown with a star symbol in the lower - right panel in figure [ fig : f7 ] . as a consequence of our rather conservative choice of the dividing line in equation [ eq : eq1 ] , the mass - based classification results in a very high purity of the selected mergers at the expense of the completeness of the merger sample . on the mirage simulated data , we estimate a completeness of up to @xmath540% for major mergers ( ratios 1:1 to 1:2.5 ) and up to 10% completeness for the minor mergers when applying equation [ eq : eq1 ] .",
    "when dealing with real data , it is useful to introduce , together with the binomial classification of equation [ eq : eq1 ] , also a more probabilistic description of the @xmath11 versus @xmath10 plane which could be used to assign a merger likelihood on individual galaxies . for this reason using the results from the simulations",
    ", we also derived a continuous parametrization of the contamination from clumpy disks over that plane .",

    "such that @xmath66 . in the above , @xmath67 and @xmath68",
    "are the original number of simulated disks and mergers and @xmath69 is our target fraction of 10% . ]",
    "we show this probabilistic mapping of disk contamination in the @xmath11 versus @xmath10 plane in the right - hand panel of figure [ fig : f8 ] .",
    "this information can be used to refine the classification on a case by case analysis .",
    "a kinematic classifications into rotationally supported disk or merger is currently available for some @xmath16 galaxies which can thus be used to further validate the calibration of the classification in the @xmath11 versus @xmath10 plane obtained from the mirage simulations . for this test",
    "we consider galaxies with a similar optical+nir wavelength coverage as our hudf sample .    in particular , a subset of the galaxies in the sins survey @xcite are located in the goods - s field and thus stellar mass maps",
    "can be built using the goods+candels data .",
    "specifically , we refer to those sins galaxies which have a kinemetry classification in table 9 of @xcite",
    ". there are three such galaxies falling in the candels / goods field : k20-id6 , k20-id7 , k20-id8 which were originally extracted from the sample of @xcite .",
    "k20-id6 and k20-id8 are classified as disks , while the nature of k20-id7 is less clear as it has been classified as merger by the kinemetry analysis in @xcite or as a disk displaying disturbed rotation in @xcite .",
    "we label it as  perturbed / merger \" to indicate that it is not a regular disk .",
    "for another galaxy that is included in our sample of galaxies with hudf+hudf12 coverage ( candels i d 15011 or udf i d 6462 ) a kinematic analysis based on sinfoni data has been published in the study of @xcite .",
    "as discussed in that work , in spite of its disturbed appearance this galaxy clearly displays a rotational motion in the @xmath70 velocity field .",
    "we hence include this object in the sample of kinematically classified disks .",
    "we performed our mass map analysis on these galaxies and compare in figure [ fig : f8 ] their location with the expectations from the simulations .",
    "inspecting figure [ fig : f8 ] , we find a very good agreement between our simulation - based partition of the @xmath11 versus @xmath10 plane and the location of the observed galaxies : all kinematically confirmed disks lie below the line defined in equation [ eq : eq1 ] in the disk - dominated locus and the kinematic merger / perturbed galaxy is on top of the merger locus , on a region where the disk contamination is expected to be @xmath1220% at the hudf depth .",
    "we note that the real kinematically confirmed disks display somewhat higher @xmath10 and @xmath11 values than the bulk of simulated mirage disks . as mentioned in section [ sec : simscaveats ] , a lower gas fraction in the simulations with respect to real galaxies or the lack of dust could be responsible for the difference .",
    "furthermore , we discuss in section [ sec : hvsmasshudf ] that a lower s / n causes a shift to higher @xmath15 .",
    "small modifications to equation [ eq : eq1 ] should be applied when using data that is shallower than hudf , as for the sins galaxies .",
    "when accounting for this effect , we still find a good agreement between the kinematic and mass classification , with galaxies k20-id6 , k20-id8 and i d 15011 falling in the disk - dominated region and the perturbed galaxy k20-id7 on the transition region between disks and mergers , consistently with its ambiguous kinematic classification .",
    "we can also use the simulations to convert the structural selection into a typical observability window during which mergers are identified as such by the mass - based classification .",
    "figure [ fig : f9 ] shows the evolution in time of the structural parameters in the mirage simulated disks and mergers . as a further illustration of the results of section [ sec : mass_vs_lightsims ] , we present the time variations for indices measured on the stellar mass maps as well as for those derived on the three optical / nir bands .",
    "the different shades of blue illustrate the evolution of mergers with different mass ratios ( increasing merger ratio for darker shades ) , whereas the magenta lines are for the isolated disks .",
    "for interacting galaxies we trace the parameters from an early merger phase at 50myr before pericenter  when the two galaxies are still separated and hence the structural indices are measured on the primary only  to after the complete fusion between the two galaxies .",
    "the peak observed in most of the indices coincides with the pre - coalescence phase that we are targeting with our selection ; clearly it becomes more distinguishable from other phases when moving from the optical to the nir and the mass maps .    the shaded gray areas in the right panels of the figure highlight the time interval over which 90% of the mergers identified by the selection in equation [ eq : eq1 ] are found : following our classification criteria we are able to identify mergers for about 200myr , i.e. between 300myr and 50myr before coalescence .",
    "this time scale is consistent with those reported by , e.g. , @xcite for optically selected mergers , although these authors find a wide range of observability time - scales ( between @xmath50.1 and 1gyr ) depending on the orientation , type of mergers as well as on the structural indicators used to detect the merger features .",
    "finally , in the top panel of figure [ fig : f9 ] we show for comparison the evolution of the sfr in the simulated galaxies ( see also figure 7 of @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , the variation in the structural parameters occurring during the merger event is not associated to a clear sfr enhancement in the simulations .",
    "@xcite list several plausible causes for the lack of the starburst phase , including the interplay between the high gas fractions and the feedback treatment in the simulations .",
    "a detailed study of the star formation histories in the mirage simulations is beyond the scope of this paper ( and is also affected by uncertainty in the models ) , the information is presented for completeness here but we will not further speculate on the links ( or absence thereof ) between the structural properties and star formation activity of the simulations .",
    "building on the results from the previous section , we now apply the mass - based classification and compare the outcome with the results from the @xmath13band images for the 87 galaxies with reliable mass maps in the hudf area ( i.e. , the 89 galaxies with sextractor kron radii larger than 5@xmath59 the psf fwhm and magnitudes @xmath7124.5 minus the two galaxies with mass maps affected by strong contamination from neighboring galaxies , see section [ sec : biases ] ) .    for the galaxies in the hudf area ,",
    "the availability of multi - depth data allows us to verify the reliability of the mass - based classification at different s / n .",
    "specifically , we consider mass maps derived from the three combinations of optical plus nir imaging described in section [ sec : massmapsreal ] : ( 1 ) goods and candels - deep data , ( 2 ) hudf plus candels - deep , and ( 3 ) the deepest maps obtained from the hudf12+hudf observations . of the 87 galaxies here considered , 50 galaxies have coverage at all depths , while for the other 37 only the first two versions of the mass maps could be derived . for comparison with the mass maps results ,",
    "we also consider structural parameters measured on the @xmath13band images at the hudf12 or candels - deep depths .    in figure",
    "[ fig : f10 ] we present the location of the hudf galaxy sample in the @xmath15 versus asymmetry plane , either derived from the @xmath13band images ( left panels ) or the stellar mass maps ( right panels ) . from top to bottom",
    "we show measurements performed on images of increasingly shallower depths .",
    "the dotted lines in the figure indicate the dividing locus of equation [ eq : eq1 ] and the different symbols highlight the visual types of section [ sec : visualclass ] . in the following",
    "we will regard galaxies with a visual class for the mass maps that is inconsistent with the quantitative criterion on @xmath10 and @xmath11 as failures of the mass - based classification , i.e. , as contaminants in the merger sample . in some cases such galaxies display genuine color gradients which could justify the mass asymmetries , but we will take the conservative approach of assuming they are the result of noise in the mass maps .",
    "we start the analysis on the real galaxies by identifying in figure [ fig : f10 ] those galaxies which would be classified as mergers based on the irregularity of their @xmath13band images . for a consistent comparison with the selection based on the mass map , we consider as mergers candidates those galaxies that satisfy equation [ eq : eq1 ] also for the @xmath13band measurements , i.e. , galaxies above the dotted lines in figure [ fig : f10 ] .",
    "other criteria are often used in the literature when using @xmath15 and asymmetries derived from optical images . at low redshift ( z@xmath411 ) a cut at @xmath72@xmath80.3 - 0.35 is typically applied to select major mergers @xcite but for z@xmath81.5 galaxies a value of @xmath72@xmath140.2 is preferred to account for the effects of the morphological @xmath73-correction , the decrease in the image resolution and surface brightness dimming @xcite . the distribution of irregular galaxies in figure 10 of @xcite would also suggest a division at @xmath74@xmath8 - 1.7 to identify mergers candidates .",
    "we have checked ( and it can be verified by inspecting figure [ fig : f10 ] ) that the result here presented would not change if these other criteria are applied .",
    "more than 90% of the galaxies that satisfy equation [ eq : eq1 ] in the @xmath13band were assigned to the class of  multi - component / disturbed \" galaxies also by the visual @xmath27 morphological analysis .",
    "this means that these galaxies would be classified as mergers by both a multi - wavelength visual inspection and a quantitative structural analysis on the @xmath13band .",
    "conversely , it can be seen that several of the merger candidates lying above the dotted line in the @xmath13band planes are visually classified as normal disk galaxies based on their mass map appearance ( orange filled triangles in the left panels of figure [ fig : f10 ] ) .",
    "these galaxies have accordingly low asymmetry and @xmath15 indices measured on the mass map ( see right panels of figure [ fig : f10 ] ) . at both the hudf12 and candels - deep depth , about @xmath5 50% of those galaxies with large enough @xmath75 and @xmath74 to be classified as mergers in the @xmath13band have a mass profile consistent with that of a normal disk galaxy and fall below equation [ eq : eq1 ] when the mass - based indices are used . to illustrate these differences between mass and @xmath13band classification , we present in figure [ fig : f11 ] the stamp images for those galaxies with @xmath75 and @xmath74 as high as those of mergers ( using either the hudf12 or candels photometry ) but a disk - like mass profile . in spite of displaying composite @xmath27 and @xmath13band morphologies dominated by multiple clumps and asymmetric light distribution which could be suggestive of a merger event ,",
    "all such galaxies have a regular , centrally concentrated distribution of mass , typically associated with a red nucleus .      focusing on the right panels of figure [ fig : f10 ]",
    ", we can instead study the results of the measurements performed on the mass maps . at the hudf+hudf12 depth ",
    "top most panel  we find an excellent agreement between the locus of mergers expected from the analysis on the simulations ( see light shaded area and dotted line ) and the visual classes for the real data .",
    "a comparison with the other right - hand panels , however , reveals some important facts : not surprisingly , the separation between galaxies visually classified as disks / compact and galaxies with visually disturbed morphologies becomes less clear as the s / n of the mass maps decreases . at the goods+candels - deep depth ,",
    "the distribution of galaxies in the @xmath10 and @xmath11 plane is noticeably more clustered than for the structural parameters derived on the hudf+hudf12 mass maps .",
    "it also appears rather clearly from figure [ fig : f10 ] that the bulk of real galaxies shifts toward higher @xmath11 values as a consequence of the decrease in s / n .",
    "this is particularly evident when comparing the data points with the shaded locus defined by the simulations .",
    "we showed in appendix [ appendix : noiseeffectsparameters ] that , while the asymmetry is almost insensitive to the image noise , some dependence of the @xmath15 on the s / n is expected and variations of the order of 10% are measured for @xmath15 indices derived at different depths .",
    "this suggests that the criterion in equation [ eq : eq1 ] , which was derived for simulations reproducing the hudf+hudf12 depth , should be revised as an  adaptive \" threshold varying with the images s / n .",
    "furthermore , we note that at the shallower depth a few merger candidates appear in a region of very low asymmetry ( @xmath76 ) but very high @xmath11 ( @xmath77 ) where virtually no simulated mergers nor galaxy visually classified as merger are found .",
    "we suspect these galaxies to be affected by measurement errors .",
    "we use the above empirical findings to provide refined criteria to robustly select mergers at the various depths :    [ eq : eq2 ] m_20 , mass & > -1.1a_mass+    -1.12 h+h12 + -1.00 h+c + -0.98 g+c +     + a_mass&>0.1 ,    where  h+h12 \" ,  h+c \" and  g+c \" stand for the mass maps derived from the hudf+hudf12 , hudf+candels - deep and goods+candels - deep photometry , respectively .",
    "these new relations where obtained by adding to the locus of equation [ eq : eq1 ] the average offsets in @xmath11 measured in figure [ fig : ap2 ] .",
    "the new selection limits are shown with dashed lines in figure [ fig : f10 ] .    by selecting as merger candidates those galaxies that satisfy the generic equations [ eq : eq1 ] we find a total of 9 , 21 and 26 mergers for the hudf+hudf12 , hudf+candels - deep and goods+candels - deep combinations , respectively .",
    "of these 2 , 6 and 10 have a visual class that is inconsistent with the quantitative analysis on the mass maps , i.e they have been assigned an either  compact \" or  disk \" class in the visual inspection of the mass maps .",
    "the use of the fixed selection of equation [ eq : eq1 ] would hence result in an increase of the contamination from @xmath78 for the hudf+hudf12 maps to @xmath79 for the goods+candels - deep combination .",
    "conversely , using the relations in equation [ eq : eq2 ] we find 9 , 15 and 15 mergers candidates with a total of 2 , 3 and 4 galaxies visually classified as non interacting , namely a roughly constant contamination of @xmath78 , regardless of the image depth .    what should be stressed here",
    "is that applying the ` adaptive ' criteria of equation [ eq : eq2 ] also to the h - band would not reduce the contamination of clumpy disks : as it is clear from the bottom left panel of figure [ fig : f10 ] , these clumpy disks are distributed everywhere in the @xmath74 and @xmath75 plane and there is no selection that would substantially reduce the contamination .    as a validation of the latter statement we considered the 50 galaxies for which all three versions of the mass maps are available and , for each combination of the photometric data",
    ", we independently identified the samples of non - interacting galaxies and mergers , even when accounting for errors ( i.e. we selected as merger candidates those galaxies that have error bars above the relations in equation [ eq : eq2 ] ) .",
    "we did so for both the @xmath21-band and mass structural indices .",
    "we then assumed that the classification performed using the deep hudf+hudf12 mass maps is the ",
    "correct \" one and we calculated for the mergers and disks identified at the other depths or in the @xmath13band the fraction that have a consistent classification ",
    "i.e. mergers or non - interacting galaxies classified as such also on the deep mass maps  and the fraction of galaxies which are instead misclassified as a consequence of the lower s / n  i.e. galaxies classified as mergers that are identified as not - merging on the deep hudf+hudf12 maps or @xmath13band images , and vice versa .",
    "we show the results of this calculation in figure [ fig : f13 ] .",
    "the number of identified mergers is small and thus the error bars relatively large , however the figure shows that by applying the relations in equation [ eq : eq2 ] the fraction of  misclassified mergers \" in the mass selected sample is consistent with being @xmath520% for mass maps obtained from both the hudf+candels - deep and goods+candels - deep combinations .",
    "conversely , for the structural indices @xmath75 and @xmath74 the contamination of false mergers remains as high as @xmath550% for both the hudf and candels observations , even when imposing the condition in equation [ eq : eq2 ] . as witnessed by the increase in the fraction of galaxies that are misclassified as disks in figure [ fig : f13 ] , the drawback of the refined selection is that a larger number of mergers are missed from the selection at the shallower depths .    summarizing the above findings , the availability of deep photometry is certainly necessary for maximizing the accuracy and completeness of the mass based classification",
    "nonetheless , applying small corrections to our simulation - motivated selection of mergers reliable mergers samples can be identified also on medium depth images , albeit reaching a lower completeness .",
    "most notably , independently of whether equations [ eq : eq1 ] or the refined relation in [ eq : eq2 ] are applied to the @xmath75 and @xmath74 indices , we find the @xmath13band classification results in a twice as large contamination of clumpy disks in the merger sample at any depth here considered .",
    "we identify our final sample of merger candidates among the hudf sample as those galaxies that satisfy the selection criteria in equation [ eq : eq2 ] even when accounting for the error in the measurements ( i.e. , have error bars above those relations ) .",
    "the classification is performed on the deep hudf+hudf12 mass maps when available and on the hudf+candels - deep maps for those galaxies with no hudf12 coverage .",
    "we find a total of 11 such candidates over the 87 galaxies with reliable mass maps .",
    "for the latter , we show in figure [ fig : f12 ] the @xmath27 , @xmath13band and mass stamps . among this sample of mergers",
    "are included one galaxy with an inconsistent visual class and also one object that has been flagged as possible chance projection in section [ sec : projectioneffects ] ( i d 15844 , but note that even excluding the secondary blue clump this galaxy would still be classified as a merger ) , suggesting again a 20% contamination level .",
    "thus far we have focused on those galaxies which are misclassified as mergers in the @xmath13band because of the presence of bright clumps .",
    "it is however interesting to test whether also the opposite occurs , i.e. , whether there are galaxies classified as mergers in the structural analysis performed on the mass maps that instead appear smooth(er ) in the @xmath13band , for example as a result of dust lanes or intrinsically high mass - to - light ratios .",
    "figure [ fig : f13 ] suggests that this happens for roughly 10% of the ",
    "@xmath21-band smooth \" galaxies . in our sample of 11 mass - selected merger candidates we find five galaxies ( ids 9704 , 11388 , 12624 , 14533 and 15432 ) that fall below the dotted lines in figure [ fig : f8 ] when using @xmath74 and @xmath75 and hence would not be classified as mergers in the @xmath13band .",
    "to understand the origin of this discrepancy , we generated new versions of the mass maps for these galaxies obtained by applying no dust extinction during the pixel - by - pixel sed fitting .",
    "this gives us an indication of whether the mass asymmetry is driven by the dust correction applied to the templates .",
    "ids 9704 and 14533 display significant asymmetries also in these mass maps , indicating that the classification is independent of the extinction law assumed .",
    "ids 12624 , 11388 and 15432 instead would not satisfy our selection criteria with dust - free mass maps .",
    "we note that both ids 12624 and 15432 are detected in the fir with total ir luminosities @xmath80 , implying a substantial amount of dust in these galaxies leading us to favor the results obtained including dust corrections .    while it is clear that additional , e.g. , kinematic , information is required for a complete characterization of the population of  mass - smooth and h - clumpy \" galaxies",
    ", the available data suggest that most of these galaxies have distinct substructure and that dust obscuration can explain some of the differences between the @xmath21-band and mass morphology .",
    "using a sample of about 100 hudf galaxies with @xmath81 , we have compared a morphological classification of merging galaxies based on non parametric structural indices derived on resolved stellar mass maps with a canonical classification obtained from @xmath13band measurements .",
    "we tested this approach using photometry at the different depths available on the hudf area ( goods , candels and hudf / hudf12 ) and , performing tests on artificial stellar mass distributions , we derived luminosity and size limits for which reliable mass maps can be obtained .",
    "the selection of mergers in the mass domain is calibrated using a sample of isolated and merging galaxies from the mirage hydrodynamical simulations which have been post - processed and analyzed to closely reproduce the observational data .",
    "we summarize our findings as follows :    1 .",
    "as also discussed in previous works @xcite , the stellar mass maps morphologies can not be reproduced by @xmath13band data alone which often display merger - like features even for galaxies with perfectly smooth , disk - like mass profiles .",
    "although some of these galaxies display a red nucleus indicative of a central mass concentration , even a combined visual inspection of multiple bands is still affected by the presence of star - forming clumps and does not provide a full proxy for the mass distribution . as a consequence of the above , we quantify that merger samples identified on the basis of asymmetry / irregularity in the @xmath13band images can have a contamination from clumpy galaxies as high as 50% .",
    "our analysis also suggests that differences between the mass- and @xmath21-band selection may originate from a population of galaxies with smoother @xmath21-band images than mass distribution , possibly as a result of dust extinction .",
    "2 .   on both the data and the simulations",
    ", we find that a combination of @xmath10 and @xmath11 measured on the stellar mass maps is instead most cleanly separating major mergers from isolated , clumpy galaxies .",
    "we use the results from the simulations and the analysis on the real hudf galaxies to provide in equations [ eq : eq1 ] and [ eq : eq2 ] quantitative criteria to separate the galaxy population into mergers and disks using mass maps derived at the hudf+hudf12 , hudf+candels - deep and goods+candels - deep depths . applying these criteria",
    ", we estimate that chance projections or the scattering of clumpy disks in the merger sample by noise in the mass maps result in a contamination of roughly 20% . when applied to galaxies with available kinematic data ,",
    "our @xmath10 and @xmath11 based classification results in morphologies that are consistent with the kinematic classes .",
    "the ability of the mass - based @xmath10 and @xmath11 indices to select true mergers is not significantly affected by a moderate decrease in the s / n of the parent images if the conditions in equation [ eq : eq2 ] are used .",
    "conversely , the @xmath21-band classification result in a twice as large contamination from clumpy disks , independently of the criteria that are applied .",
    "4 .   from the analysis of the mirage simulated mergers we estimate the proposed @xmath10 , @xmath11 selection should be sensitive to major mergers between 300 myr and 50 myr before coalescence .",
    "based on the above results , we thus suggest that to identify major mergers a classification in the mass domain rather than from optical / nir images should be preferred and performed whenever possible .",
    "obviously , our technique is only sensitive to merger phases in which the perturbation in the mass profiles is measurable ( roughly up to 300myr before coalescence as specified above ) and , as also a consequence of imposing a high purity in the resulting merger sample , is strongly biased against earlier merger stages .",
    "a combination with other techniques ( e.g. , close kinematic pair selection ) would be hence necessary for a full census of merging systems .",
    "finally , it is possible that variations in the gas fraction of galaxies and the actual masses of giant clumps could introduce some redshift dependent scaling of the threshold here derived , moving the locus of clumpy disks toward slightly higher @xmath10 and/or @xmath11 values at higher redshift .",
    "however , we expect that these variations would be comparable to the uncertainties in the mass maps and the derived structural parameters and hence would not strongly affect the proposed classification for sufficiently large samples .",

    "as a basic consistency check of the mass maps for the sample described in section [ sec : sampleselection ] , we show in figure [ fig : ap1 ] the comparison between the sum of the masses in each individual pixel of the galaxy and the total galaxy mass that is obtained from the integrated photometry . although for highly obscured or strongly star - forming galaxies differences between the two estimates can be expected on an object by object basis due to the patchy distribution of dust , strong disagreement between the resolved and integrated estimates would be an indication of biases in the pixel - by - pixel sed fits .",
    "we instead find a very good agreement between the pixel - based total mass and the whole galaxy mass , with a median difference which is less than 0.1dex .          as mentioned in section [ sec : biases ] , the resolution and noise of the parent observations set major limitations for the estimate of the stellar mass maps . in order to derive the size and magnitude limits for which a reliable mass map can be obtained , we tested the pixel - based sed fitting on a sample of artificial galaxies with known mass distribution . to perform the test on model galaxies which are representative of the typical real galaxies",
    ", the models were drawn from the observed sample as follows .",
    "for each real hudf galaxy in the initial sample presented in section [ sec : sampleselection ] , we generated a toy mass distribution characterized by a srsic profile with a total mass equal to the galaxy integrated mass and structural parameters determined by the best - fit @xmath13band galfit @xcite model . to densely populate the magnitude - size plane",
    ", we also generated extra models by adding random perturbations on the original galaxies parameters .",
    "we then imposed each pixel in the artificial galaxy to have an sed equal to the observed best - fit sed for the entire galaxy ( including a uniform extinction for all pixels ) and used this sed to predict the pixel fluxes .    from these flux maps we generated artificial @xmath22 images which we pasted into blank sky regions to mimic the typical s / n properties reached by the real galaxies with hudf optical plus candels - deep nir coverage .",
    "this depth is in between the two extreme combination of imaging ( deep hudf+hudf12 or shallow goods+candels - deep ) used for creating the mass maps ( see section [ sec : archivaldata ] ) . specifically , we created stamps at the hudf depth for the f435w , f606w , f775w and f850lp filters , while the f814w , f105w , f125w and f160w images were matched to the candels - deep depth .",
    "all images were degraded to the resolution of the f160w filter as in the real sample .",
    "we finally computed  observed \" mass maps form these artificial images as described in section [ sec : massmapsreal ] , i.e. , by running adaptsmooth , extracting pixel - based seds and fitting them with lephare and used these  observed \" mass maps for our tests in section [ sec : biases ] .",
    "although these simulations are undoubtedly a simplification of reality which is complicated by pixel - by - pixel variations of the sed , dust content , etc .",
    "they provide us with a measure of systematic biases in the mass estimation .        1 .   the concentration @xmath82 defined as the logarithmic ratio of the radii containing 20% and 80% of the total flux @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "2 .   the gini coefficient @xcite , which describes the uniformity of the flux distribution on a scale between 0 ( all pixels with equal flux ) and 1 ( all flux in just one pixel ) .",
    "3 .   and finally the multiplicity @xmath84 that quantifies the presence of multiple components through a comparison between the original image and a resampled version in which the pixels are re - arranged in decreasing flux order from the brightest pixel @xcite . for this latter parameter",
    "we slightly modified the original definition proposed in @xcite to account for ellipsoidal light / mass distribution .",
    "we present in figure [ fig : f7_appendix ] the analogous of figure [ fig : f7 ] but this time considering planes that include also @xmath82 , gini and @xmath84 . on one hand",
    ", the figure reinforces the results of sections [ sec : simulationinsight ] and [ sec : masslightrealgal ] : even for these different combinations of structural indicators , the contamination in a mass - based selection of mergers is smaller than that obtained with measurements performed on the f160w and f850lp images . on the other ,",
    "it justifies the choice of @xmath11@xmath10 as our fiducial combination : it can be noticed in fact that these other sets of indices result in either a higher contamination or lower completeness with respect to a classification based on @xmath11@xmath10 ( see lower panels of figure [ fig : f7_appendix ] and figure [ fig : f7 ] ) .",
    "an exception is the gini@xmath85@xmath10 combination which produces comparable results to those obtained for @xmath11@xmath10 .",
    "we show in the following that the gini coefficient is however more sensitive to the choice of the aperture used in the calculation and the noise in the image than the @xmath15 or @xmath72 indices and hence a less stable structural measurement .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig : ap2 ] where study the variation of the structural indices with image depth and aperture size used in the calculation .",
    "we only discuss the comparison for the structural indices measured on the mass maps obtained from the combinations of hudf+hudf12 , hudf+candels - deep and goods+candels - deep photometry .",
    "nonetheless , we also present the results for the indices derived on the @xmath13band at hudf or candels depth for completeness of information",
    ". specifically , we considered those galaxies ( 50 ) with @xmath86psf and @xmath7124.5 that have coverage in the hudf , candels as well as goods fields and calculated the structural indices at all depths , within either a kron or petrosian aperture .",
    "the use of two different apertures allows us to further test the impact of the noise in the images : the kron aperture is usually larger than the petrosian radius . ]",
    "( see table [ tab : sampleprop ] ) and hence includes a higher number of low flux pixels ; differences between the two estimates can be used to assess the stability of the measurement .",
    "this is also the reason why we opted for a petrosian aperture in the calculation of the parameters in section [ sec : nonparam_indices ] .",
    "the points in figure [ fig : ap2 ] show the median values of the structural indices over all the 50 galaxies here considered .",
    "a reliable measure of structure should show as little variation as possible with both imaging depth and aperture size in figure [ fig : ap2 ] .",
    "the asymmetry @xmath10 is in this sense very robust with median values that remain almost identical at all depths and for both apertures .",
    "this should be compared , for example , with the results for the gini coefficient in the right - most column which clearly shows a strong dependence on the aperture size with differences up to about 30% . as already pointed out in the work of @xcite ,",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that gini becomes a tracer of the noise in the images rather than galactic structure for large apertures .",
    "the other parameters , @xmath11 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 , all show some dependence on the depth of the images used for constructing the maps , shifting towards lower concentrations / higher clumpiness when using the goods+candels - deep photometry instead of the deep hudf+hudf12 imaging .",
    "the largest variations are measured for the multiplicity @xmath87 ( more than 50% change among the various cases ) , whereas the @xmath11 coefficient varies by @xmath89 .    in combination with figure [ fig : f7 ] ,",
    "these findings justify our choice of @xmath10- @xmath11 in section [ sec : testonsims1 ] as the most powerful and less noise- or aperture - dependent parameter set for the discrimination of merging and clumpy galaxies .",
