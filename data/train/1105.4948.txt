    "generation of continuous variable entangled states with atomic ensembles coupled to a radiation field has been intensively discussed both theoretically and experimentally in recent years  @xcite .",
    "atomic ensembles are macroscopic systems composed of a large number of atoms , and therefore it is a common practice in the theoretical treatments to work in the thermodynamic limit which takes the number of atoms @xmath1 inside an ensemble to infinity , @xmath2 . under this approximation ,",
    "the collective atomic operators are often represented , by using the holstein - primakoff representation of angular momentum operators  @xcite , in terms of mutually independent bosonic modes , called collective bosonic modes .",
    "a large number of studies of a such system have been carried out in searching for superradiance and quantum phase transitions  @xcite .",
    "the atomic ensembles have also been used to demonstrate the deterministic creation of nonclassical light fields in the interaction of atoms with a cavity field .",
    "cavities , in particular microwave and ring cavities , provide efficient and controllable setting for a strong interaction between macroscopic atomic ensembles and the electromagnetic field  @xcite . for example ,",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have demonstrated that atomic ensembles interacting collectively with laser fields inside a high-@xmath0 ring cavity can be unconditionally prepared in a two - mode squeezed state .",
    "the scheme , which is a generalization of the guzman _",
    "_  @xcite scheme to four - level atoms , is based on a suitable driving of the atomic ensembles with two external laser fields and coupling to a damped cavity mode that prepares the atoms in a pure squeezed ( entangled ) state .",
    "similar schemes have been proposed to realize an effective dicke model operating in the phase transition regime , to create a stationary subradiant state in an ultracold atomic gas  @xcite .",
    "this approach has also been considered as a practical scheme to prepare trapped and cooled ions in pure entangled vibrational states  @xcite and to prepare four ensembles of hot atoms in pure entangled cluster states  @xcite .",
    "recently , krauter _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have proposed to employ dissipation for generating a steady state entanglement between two distant atomic ensembles .",
    "studies of macroscopic systems composed of atomic ensembles interacting with a cavity field do not have to be confined to the thermodynamic limit .",
    "it has recently been demonstrated experimentally that small atomic ensembles could serve as a resource for quantum metrology and quantum information science  @xcite .",
    "this is the purpose of the present paper to consider a spatially extended finite - size atomic ensemble interacting with counter - propagating modes of a high-@xmath0 ring cavity .",
    "special emphasis is given to identifying intrinsically finite - size effects .",
    "the approach adopted here is based on the solution of the master equation of an effective two - level system involving ground states of the four - level atoms forming the atomic ensemble .",
    "the approach has similarities with some previous treatments , except that we introduce a spatial dependence of the interaction of the cavity modes and the laser fields with the atoms .",
    "the spatial dependence arises naturally in the interaction of the fields with a finite - size atomic ensemble  @xcite , and the objective is to explore explicitly the issue of size effects in creation of coherence and entanglement in continuous variable systems . examples of coherence processes are given to illustrate the effect of a finite size of the atomic ensemble on creation of an entanglement between bosonic modes of the system .",
    "we find that the dynamics of the finite - size atomic ensemble differs qualitatively from those given in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the inclusion of finite - size effects leads to a wide variety of unusual features .",
    "in particular , we find that collective bosonic modes of a finite - size atomic ensemble are not in general orthogonal to each other . in the course of the derivation of an effective hamiltonian of the system , we observe that one of the finite - size effects is to create a direct coupling between the counter - propagating cavity modes . the mode nonorthogonality that couples the counter - propagating modes",
    "can drastically modify the property of the system .",
    "the important modification is that the coupling lifts the degeneracy of the cavity modes and leads to significantly different statistical properties of the modes .",
    "we present solutions for the second - order statistical moments of different modes of the system and find that the mode nonorthogonality gives rise to phase locking between the cavity counter - propagating modes , which leads to interesting first - order coherence effects .",
    "we also study the second - order correlation functions of the counter - propagating modes and show that the nonorthogonality leads to the super - bunching effect .",
    "in addition , we show that the nonorthogonality creates correlations that are necessary for entanglement between the intracavity modes . however , we find that the correlations created are not strong enough to produce and entangle between the cavity counter - propagating modes . we are therefore led to consider spectral distributions of the field variances and logarithmic negativity  @xcite and",
    "find that the two - mode squeezing and the entanglement can actually be created between spectral components of the output cavity fields .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec2 ] , we describe in more detail the cavity and atomic ensemble under consideration .",
    "we derive an effective hamiltonian of the system and show that the major finite - size effect is in the nonorthogonality of the collective bosonic modes .",
    "we then apply the hamiltonian to derive the heisenberg equations of motion for the field operators , and solve them in terms of the fourier transform variables .",
    "section  [ sec3 ] is devoted for the study of the mode nonorthogonality on coherence and entanglement properties of the counter - propagating cavity modes .",
    "in particular , in sections  [ sec3a ] and  [ sec3b ] , we analyze the first and second order coherence , respectively , between the counter - propagating cavity modes .",
    "we pay particular attention to the role of the mode nonorthogonality in the creation of coherence and correlations between the modes .",
    "spectral distributions of the logarithmic negativity and the variances of the output fields are considered in section  [ sec3d ] , where we illustrate the possibility of the creation of entanglement between spectral components of the output fields of the cavity modes .",
    "a summary of results is presented in section  [ sec4 ] .",
    "finally , in the appendix , we present analytical expressions for the steady - state mode occupation numbers , average amplitudes and correlations between the modes .",
    "the model we are considering is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1a ] .",
    "it consists of an atomic ensemble located inside a high-@xmath0 ring cavity .",
    "the cavity field is composed of two degenerate in frequency and overlapped counter - propagating modes , called clockwise @xmath3 and anti - clockwise  @xmath4 modes , characterized by equal frequencies @xmath5 , and anti - parallel wave vectors @xmath6 , respectively . the modes are represented by operators @xmath7 and @xmath8 which are , respectively , the annihilation and creation operators for the cavity clockwise ( anti - clockwise ) mode .    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     it is interesting to observe that the cavity modes can be entangled regardless of the size of the atomic ensemble .",
    "however , the frequency range at which the modes are entangled varies with the finite - size parameter  @xmath9 , i.e. , the modes can be entangled at several different frequencies .",
    "when @xmath10 , the logarithmic negativity and the variances can both have four peaks .",
    "when @xmath11 , the peaks merge towards @xmath12 . in this case , two - mode squeezing occurs only in the @xmath13 quadrature .",
    "it follows that with a finite - size ensemble , the largest entanglement is observable in principle at the frequency  @xmath14 .",
    "thus , the size effect is to concentrate the entanglement at the central component of the spectrum . in other words ,",
    "an optimal degree of squeezing ( entanglement ) at @xmath12 indicates that the output modes are correlated about the average laser frequency @xmath14 .",
    "figure  [ fig7 ] illustrates how the pumping strength @xmath15 alters spectral redistribution of two - mode squeezing and entanglement .",
    "again , each curve is plotted with @xmath13 optimized to give best squeezing .",
    "it can be seen that only the low frequency entanglement and two - mode squeezing @xmath16 shifts towards the central frequency as  @xmath15 increases .",
    "notice significant variations of the low frequency entanglement and squeezing with relatively small variations of  @xmath15 .",
    "in contrast , the high frequency entanglement and squeezing are almost insensitive to @xmath15 .",
    "the effect of raising  @xmath15 causes only a slight shift of the peaks .",
    "thus , the entanglement and two - mode squeezing associated with the @xmath17 quadrature component are less sensitive to @xmath15 than those associated with the @xmath13 quadrature component .",
    "nevertheless , this does not prevent us from achieving the largest entanglement at the cavity frequency .",
    "we have shown that finite sizes of atomic ensembles coupled to counter - propagating modes of a high-@xmath0 cavity do have a non - negligible effect on coherence , correlations and entanglement between the cavity modes .",
    "in particular , we have shown that finite sizes of the atomic ensemble may result in nonorthogonality of the collective bosonic modes .",
    "we have found that the mode nonorthogonality can create the first - order coherence between the modes and appears as the transfer mechanism of the fluctuations between the superpositions of the cavity counter - propagating modes .",
    "we have shown that the mode nonorthogonality may result in the second - order correlations that are stronger than that of a thermal field .",
    "the correlations are manifested in the photon super - bunching effect .",
    "in addition , the nonorthogonality creates correlations between the modes that are necessary for two - mode squeezing and entanglement between the modes .",
    "however , we have found that the correlations created are not strong enough to violate the cauchy - schwartz inequality and to produce entanglement between the modes .",
    "therefore , we have also considered the spectral distributions of the logarithmic negativity and the variances of the output cavity fields and have found that entanglement , although not present in the total field , can be created between spectral components of the output cavity fields .",
    "the effect of the mode nonorthogonality is to concentrate the entanglement at the central component of the spectrum .",
