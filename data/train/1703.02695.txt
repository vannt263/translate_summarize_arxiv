    "as one of the major quantitative characteristics of spectral distributions for electromagnetic radiation , one commonly uses the concept of spectral half - width . for spectral distributions having a sharp maximum , spectral half - width is the most informative physical characteristic .",
    "however , once a spectral distribution has no pronounced maximum , spectral half - width ceases to be an adequate quantitative characteristic .",
    "in particular , this is exactly the case of spectral distributions for synchrotron radiation ( sr ) , and therefore sr spectral half - width has neither been calculated theoretically , nor measured experimentally .    instead of spectral half - width , the present study proposes to introduce a new precise quantitative characteristic of sr spectral distributions : effective spectral width .",
    "it is shown how this quantity can be calculated theoretically , and which physically relevant information can be obtained using this quantity .    at present",
    ", the theory of synchrotron radiation is a fairly well - developed area of theoretical physics .",
    "its main elements are described in monographs ( e.g. @xcite ) and numerous articles . among the most important sr physical features",
    ", one should take into account a high polarization degree of radiation and a unique structure of spectral distributions .",
    "all theoretically predictable sr properties have been confirmed by experiment .",
    "the development of sr theory allows one not only to predict radiation characteristics qualitatively , but also to offer exact quantitative characteristics of physically important properties .",
    "for example , the high degree of sr polarization was qualitatively predicted by theory more than half a century ago ( see , e.g.,@xcite ) ; precise quantitative characteristics for linear polarization were also obtained , whereas such quantitative characteristics for circular polarization were obtained much later @xcite .    in order to set up the problem ,",
    "we now present some well - known expressions of the classical sr  theory for the physical characteristics of synchrotron radiation , which can be found in @xcite .",
    "the spectral - angular distribution for radiation power of sr polarization components can be written as@xmath0here , the following notation is used : @xmath1 is the angle between the control magnetic field strength and the radiation field pulse ; @xmath2 is the number of an emitted harmonic ; the charge orbital motion rate is @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the speed of light ; @xmath5 is the total radiated power of unpolarized radiation , which can be written as@xmath6where @xmath7 is the particle charge ; @xmath8 is the orbit radius ; @xmath9 is the control field strength ; @xmath10 is the charge rest mass ; @xmath11 is the relativistic factor .",
    "the index @xmath12 numbers the polarization components : @xmath13 corresponds to the @xmath14-component of linear polarization ; @xmath15 corresponds to the @xmath16-component of linear polarization ; @xmath17 corresponds to right - hand circular polarization ; @xmath18 corresponds to left - hand circular polarization ; @xmath19 corresponds to the power of unpolarized radiation .",
    "the functions @xmath20 have the form @xcite@xmath21@xmath22 ^{2};\\ \\",
    "x=\\nu \\beta \\sin \\theta ; \\ \\ \\varepsilon = -\\frac{e}{|e| } ;   \\notag\\]]@xmath23here , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the bessel functions and their derivatives . in",
    "what follows , the case of an electron is considered , which corresponds to @xmath26 .",
    "it is well known @xcite that the angle range @xmath27 ( this range will be called the upper half - space ) is dominated by right - hand circular polarization , and the angle range @xmath28 ( this range will be called the lower half - space ) is dominated by left - hand circular polarization ( exact quantitative characteristics of sr properties were first obtained in @xcite ) . however ,",
    "if we integrate in ( [ 1 ] ) over @xmath29 , then the differences in the spectral distribution of right- and left - hand circular polarizations disappear . to reveal these differences , the expressions ( [ 1 ] )",
    "can be represented as@xmath30 \\,;\\",

    "in particular , it was shown @xcite that in the segment @xmath44 the function @xmath43 is finite and decreases monotonously ; at the end of this segment , it takes the following values:@xmath45",
    "as one of the quantitative characteristics of physical properties for spectral distributions of sr polarization components , it is proposed to introduce the concept of effective spectral width @xmath46 .",

    "it is equally obvious that condition ( [ 11 ] ) alone is generally insufficient to determine the pair of values @xmath53 .",
    "let us now choose such @xmath56 , @xmath57 that the condition ( [ 11 ] ) should provide the minimum of the difference @xmath58 , as well as the minimum of the non - negative value@xmath59the effective spectral width @xmath47 is defined by the expression@xmath60    consequently , effective spectral width is the minimum spectral range that accounts for at least half of all the radiated power of a given polarization component .",
    "the harmonics @xmath56 and @xmath61 determine the beginning and the end of this minimum spectral range .",
    "a definition equivalent to the one presented above for effective spectral width can be given using the concept of partial contributions @xmath62 for individual spectral harmonics , introduced in @xcite .",
    "namely , we suppose , according to @xcite , * *  * * @xmath63then ( [ 4 ] ) implies the property@xmath64we choose some values @xmath56 and @xmath65 such that the minimum difference @xmath66 should provide the minimum of the non - negative value@xmath67introducing @xmath47 in accordance with ( [ 13 ] ) , we arrive at the following equivalent definition : effective spectral width is the minimum spectral range at which the sum of partial contributions for individual harmonics is not less than @xmath68 .    in practice ,",
