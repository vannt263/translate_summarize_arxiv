    "one of the fundamental tasks in network analysis is to partition a network into clusters , or modules , of similar nodes , which often correspond to functional units in biological networks  @xcite or communities in social networks  @xcite .",
    "the vast majority of methods developed for this task rely on network topology , i.e. , the structure of links between nodes , and treat the nodes themselves as indistinguishable .",
    "for example , spectral partitioning methods  @xcite identify which links to cut to separate the network into disconnected components , while modularity - based approaches  @xcite find clusters of densely connected nodes . real - world networks , however , are often rich in content , with nodes that have distinguishing features or attributes .",
    "individuals in a social network differ in age , gender , education and interests , while articles in a scientific paper citation network have different words and topics .",
    "the similarities and differences in the content of nodes can affect the patterns of linking , particularly in social networks  @xcite , and taking them into account may improve the quality of the discovered modules .",
    "this observation has inspired several attempts to partition content - rich networks  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to these works , we describe a parameter - free , conceptually simple method that combines information in links and node attributes to partition a network .",
    "our method is situated in the information - theoretic framework introduced by rosvall @xmath0 bergstrom  @xcite for finding the modular structure of networks .",
    "their approach is inspired by an observation that information flows on a network tend to get trapped within modules . as a consequence",
    ", it is possible to compress the description of information flow by reusing names of nodes in different modules . using random walks as a proxy for information flow , their method partitions the network so as to minimize the map equation , which gives the expected description length of a random walk .",
    "thus , the approach exploits the duality between identifying structure and the compression problem to identify the optimal number of modules in the network and to assign the nodes to modules .    to describe the flow of information in a content - rich network , however , it is not sufficient to account for the node names and modules .",
    "we need an effective means of accounting for node attributes as well . to this end",
    ", we introduce the _ content map equation _ , which incorporates node attributes into a description of information flow , and use it to compress the flow of information on content - rich networks .",
    "the content map equation groups nodes into modules not only when information frequently flows between them , but also when they have similar attributes .",
    "our method has several desirable properties .",
    "first , it is conceptually simple and treats links and attributes on an equal footing .",
    "it is parameter - free and does not require us to specify the number of modules ahead of time .",
    "it is not sensitive to content representation , i.e. , how many attributes are used to characterize nodes .",
    "additionally , it does not require a parameter to control the relative contributions of links and attributes in encoding network information .",
    "this is contrast to other methods  @xcite , whose quality relies on successfully tuning such a parameter . finding a minimum solution to the content map equation is in most cases a hard optimization problem .",
    "similarly to rosvall & bergstrom , we use a greedy bottom - up search to find a locally optimal solution . in that procedure , each node starts in its own module , and the search proceeds by merging modules so as to minimize the total description length",
    ". however , this becomes intractable for large networks . to address this problem ,",
    "we propose a top - down search strategy that has better scaling properties than the original greedy algorithm .",
    "we show that it leads to dramatically better computational performance without sacrificing result quality .",
    "we use the proposed method to partition several real - world networks with node attributes and a known community structure .",
    "we demonstrate that the content map equation identifies better modules than the original map equation , which does not use content information .",
    "we also show that our method outperforms alternative methods that use both links and attributes , both in terms of runtime and in terms of the quality of the discovered modules .    in the rest of the paper , we first review related work ( section  [ sec : background ] ) , including rosvall & bergstrom s map equation . in section  [ sec : content ]",
    "we introduce the content map equation that includes node attributes in a description of information in a network .",
    "we illustrate on toy networks the difference in the resulting partitions . in section  [ sec : greedy ] , we describe a greedy bottom - up algorithm that uses the content map equation to minimize the description length of a random walk .",
    "the bottom - up algorithm does not scale to large networks ; therefore , we propose a top - down algorithm with random restarts that significantly speeds up the compression problem . in section",
    "[ sec : results ] we use the proposed methods to partition real - world networks with known community structure and demonstrate that our algorithm is faster and more accurate than competing methods .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we first look at the twitter interaction network for proposition 30 .",
    "figure  [ fig : yes30](a ) divides the network into communities according to the content map equation , placing nodes within the same module closer together and with the same color .",
    "there are many small communities and a few larger , densely connected communities .",
    "but how far are the outputted communities from the ground truth ?",
    "the ground truth for this network is shown in figure  [ fig : yes30](b ) , where we placed nodes in the same locations , but colored them according to their stance : green for users who support proposition 30 , red for users who oppose it , and blue for neutral users .",
    "this highlights the types of communities found in this network , including a few large communities that predominantly consist of users of one stance and a few smaller communities comprised of individuals with difference stances .",
    "while the cme breaks users into many communities , the communities themselves are relatively pure , i.e. , composed of users who have the same stance on the proposition .",
    "next , we visualize the communities found by cme in the arnetminer citations network . from figure",
    "[ fig : arnetminerfull ] , we are able to observe that the communities are of two types , either a community with nodes of only one topic or a community with a mixture of topics . for instance",
    ", the majority of orange color nodes corresponds to the topic web mining and information fusion ( wm ) . in communities of the latter kind , for instance",
    ", black dashed box with red color , it contains not only single - topic nodes of both ( ws ) and ( db ) , but also nodes that were members of both topics .",
    "one of the reason is that in the ground truth , some of the topics co - occur very frequently ( i.e. , there exists a single node with multiple ground truth topic labels ) .",
    "thus , by qualitative evaluation , we verify that the partitioning outputted by cme correctly identifies similar nodes .",
    "we quantitatively evaluate network partitioning using the point - wise normalized f - measure , purity and clustering accuracy to compare how well the discovered communities reproduce the classes present in the data .",
    "[ [ f - measure ] ] f - measure + + + + + + + + +    given an output community @xmath1 and with reference to a ground truth class @xmath2 ( both in the form of node set ) , we define the precision rate as @xmath3 and the recall rate as @xmath4 . the f - measure of @xmath1 on @xmath2 , denoted as @xmath5 , is the harmonic mean of precision and recall rates .",
    "the final f - measure  @xcite of the outputted partitioning @xmath6 on the ground truth clustering @xmath7 is then calculated as @xmath8    [ [ purity ] ] purity + + + + + +    the purity of the outputted partitioning @xmath6 on the ground truth clustering @xmath7 is defined as @xmath9    [ [ clustering - accuracy ] ] clustering accuracy + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    assume that we assign the outputted community with ground truth label using the majority vote .",
    "then the clustering accuracy evaluates the percentage of nodes with correct assignments .",
    "@xmath10 we do not consider normalized mutual information as a performance measure , because our approach finds a much larger number of classes than exist in the ground truth , making discovered classes poor predictors of the ground truth class distribution .",
    "if there are two groups with the same ground truth label but with no edges between them , then we should nt expect them to be placed in the same module .",
    "[ [ baselines ] ] baselines + + + + + + + + +    we compare the algorithms proposed in this paper , bottom - up content map equation ( b - cme ) and top - down cme ( t - cme ) to three classes of baselines : 1 ) content - based approaches , such as topic modeling ( e.g. , lda  @xcite ) ; 2 ) structure - based approaches such as the map equation ( me  @xcite ) ; and 3 ) methods which use both links and attributes , such as bacg  @xcite and codicil  @xcite .",
    "we do not compare to approaches  @xcite since they only support a single - attribute per node .",
    "our method produces much better f - measure scores than @xcite on two benchmark dataset citeseer and pubmed .",
    "however , we do not include it in the results since they did not apply it to other datasets .",
    "the experiments were performed on a 2.7ghz intel i-7 cpu with 8 g of memory .",
    "figure  [ fig : time ] compares the runtimes of different methods .",
    "results are ordered by network size ( number of nodes and links , see table  [ tab : datastat ] ) , except for the citeseer citations network , which we put between arnetminer and facebook datasets to improve visualization .",
    "note that for baseline bacg , we only have the results for the small to medium - size networks , since the implementation of bacg runs out of memory for large networks such as pubmed and flickr .",
    "results indicate that our bottom - up search implementation is faster than other baselines for small networks , comparable to other baselines for medium size network , but is much slower than other baselines for large networks .",
    "this motivates us to use the top - down implementation , which is significantly faster than alternative methods .",
    "the t - cme is about one order of magnitude faster than other baselines and two orders of magnitude faster than the b - cme .    for the baselines",
    ", bacg is more efficient than others since it stores many matrices in memory to facilitate computation , which leads to its memory bottleneck for large networks .",
    "the running time of content - based approach lda depends on the number of nodes and the number of attributes in content vectors .",
    "hence , lda runs much faster than others in flickr and facebook , where the link information is much heavier than the content information .",
    "codicil first constructs a content graph , performs local sparsity analysis on the content graph , and then runs the community detection algorithm me on the sparse content graph .",
    "thus , codicil always runs slower than me due to additional costs to construct and sparsify the content graph .",
    "figure  [ fig : fmeasure ] compares the f measures ( eq .  [ equ : fmeasure ] ) obtained by different approaches on the datasets .",
    "recall that bacg fails to run the pubmed and flickr datasets on our machine due to huge memory consumption .",
    "the results indicate that inclusion of node attributes lead to a better partition than using links alone ( me ) .",
    "the improvement is especially dramatic for the citeseer and pubmed datasets .",
    "the possible reason is that in the citeseer and pubmed citations networks , each node has very few links on average ; therefore , structural information is very weak .",
    "hence , the map equation finds a worse grouping of papers than content - aware approaches .",
    "the content map equation is also much better than using content alone ( e.g. , lda ) .    compared to baselines bacg and codicil , the content map equation ( both top - down and bottom - up )",
    "is consistently better .",
    "the top - down algorithm ( t - cme ) in general produces slightly worse results than the bottom - up approach , but it is much faster than the bottom - up method ( b - cme ) .",
    "this indicates that the proposed top - down algorithm has a good trade - off between efficiency and quality .",
    "in addition to f - measure , we also use purity ( eq .",
    "[ equ : purity ] ) and accuracy ( eq .  [ equ : accuracy ] ) , shown in figure  [ fig : purity ] and figure  [ fig : accy ] , respectively , to evaluate network parittioning .",
    "both results show that content map equation outperforms the baseline bacg and codicil",
    ". however , in citeseer and pubmed , the top - down greedy search ( t - cme ) produces a better partition than the bottom - up search ( b - cme ) , according to the purity measure .",
    "there is no surprise if we look at the description length of the partitioning outputted by the two different search strategies ( see table  [ tab : mdllength ] ) .",
    "we notice that t - cme achieves lower description length than b - cme for citeseer and pubmed as well .",
    "these results are consistent with the intuition  @xcite that if we can correctly categorize the data ( high purity within cluster ) , then the data can be described with the highest efficiency ( i.e. , using the minimum message length ) .    in summary ,",
    "our approach identifies better communities in content - rich networks than alternative state - of - the - art methods that also take links and node attributes into account .",
    "having established that the top - down method gives a good trade - off between partition quality and runtime , we now investigate the effect of different optimizations of the top - down algorithm .",
    "specifically , we look at the effect of the initialization , i.e. , the initial assignment of nodes to modules ( see section  [ subsec : topdown ] ) . we investigate whether leveraging attributes or links helps identify better modules .",
    "the intuition is that once the nodes are assigned to modules based on their attributes , cme can use information in the links to find a locally better solution .",
    "we use a topic modeling technique , e.g. , lda  @xcite , to make the initial assignment .",
    "lda requires the number of topics to be specified ; hence , lda20 means that the number of topics was set to 20 , and lda means that the number of topics was set to the true number of classes in the respective dataset .",
    "alternatively , we can initialize the partition based on links alone , e.g. , using the map equation , and then use attributes information to find a locally better solution with cme .",
    "we compare the partition quality resulting from random initialization to that resulting from lda or me initializations .",
    "figure  [ fig : initfmeasure ] reports the f - measure of the partition identified by the top - down method using different initializations ( purity and accuracy results are similar ) .",
    "surprisingly , the results demonstrate that neither lda nor me initializations help much in terms of partition quality improvement .",
    "random initializations achieve better f - measure scores than lda in 5 of 6 datasets , and better than me initialization in 3 of 6 datasets .",
    "since the content map equation already incorporates content information equally with link information , the lda / me initializations only reweigh ( or increase ) the contribution of content / link information , which deteriorates performance .    finally , we look at the effectiveness of different initialization methods to compress a random walk on a content - rich network .",
    "the results , shown in figure  [ fig : mlength ] , suggest that both lda and me initializations generally do not lead to better compression .",
    "since both me and lda initialization are very time - consuming ( see figure  [ fig : time ] ) , it is better to use random initialization in the top - down search method .",
    "we have proposed and evaluated an information theoretic method for finding the modular structure of networks with node attributes . building on the map equation of rosvall & bergstrom  @xcite",
    ", we incorporate a new term that summarizes the contribution of the attributes to the description length of a random walk . by minimizing the resulting content map equation , we are able to identify modules with a larger information flow among the nodes , where the nodes also have similar attributes .",
    "accounting for node attributes changes the discovered modules .",
    "our empirical evaluation of several large real - world networks demonstrates that the content map equation results in a partition that is closer to the ground truth division then using links alone , or using alternative methods that take attributes into consideration .",
    "moreover , in contrast to other methods , our framework does not require ad - hoc parameters that control the contribution of links and attributes to structure .",
    "one drawback of the approach is that it does not capture the dependencies among attributes in module dictionaries . because partitioning results are insensitive to , e.g. , duplication of attributes in a representation , any additional information supplied by highly correlated attributes is essentially ignored .",
    "it would be an interesting challenge to extend the information theoretic framework to take these dependencies into account ."
