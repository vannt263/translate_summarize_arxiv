    "the discovery of a higgs boson near 126 gev @xcite has profound implications for supersymmetry as a solution to the electroweak hierarchy problem .",
    "this is especially the case in minimal supersymmetry , where the stops must either be unnaturally heavy ( @xmath5 tev ) or have a large trilinear coupling to the higgs @xcite .",
    "the former possibility leaves little hope for preserving naturalness or observational signals at the lhc , so we will focus on the latter scenario .",
    "this requires a plausible mechanism for generating such large @xmath1-terms without introducing large flavor violation or other unwanted effects .",
    "the lack of decisive deviations in searches for flavor and cp violation has long favored low - scale gauge mediation by virtue of its flavor universality .",
    "however , in its minimal form , gauge mediation is challenged by the higgs sector , since it generates neither the @xmath2 and @xmath3 parameters necessary for electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) , nor the @xmath1-terms suggested by the higgs mass measurement .",
    "these terms may be generated in a flavor universal manner by adding interactions between the higgs sector and the messenger sector , @xmath6 where @xmath7 are messenger - sector operators .",
    "although the @xmath2 and @xmath1-terms are obtained trivially in such a setup , viable solutions must confront two thorny problems : the `` @xmath2/@xmath3 problem '' @xcite and the `` @xmath1/@xmath4 problem '' @xcite .",
    "both problems arise because adding higgs - messenger interactions that generate a @xmath2 ( @xmath1 ) term also tend to produce a @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) term that is too large for viable electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the most stringent form of the @xmath1/@xmath4 problem may be resolved if the sole source of messenger mass is a single susy - breaking spurion @xcite , as in minimal gauge mediation ( mgm ) @xcite .",
    "but even in this case the @xmath2/@xmath3 problem remains unaddressed , and requires a further extension of the model .",
    "moreover , there is a residual `` little @xmath1/@xmath4 problem '' , as any weakly - coupled model that generates large @xmath1-terms through higgs - messenger interactions also generates contributions to the higgs soft masses proportional to @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "even if these contributions do not prevent electroweak symmetry breaking , they significantly increase the fine - tuning associated with the weak scale .    in this paper , we present an alternative framework which uses strong dynamics in the hidden sector to economically solve both the @xmath2/@xmath3 and @xmath1/@xmath4 problems .",
    "two ingredients are required for this : that there exists a hierarchy between the messenger scale @xmath9 and the susy - breaking scale @xmath10 ; and that the anomalous dimensions of the operators responsible for susy - breaking are large and positive .",
    "the former property is a generic prediction of dynamical supersymmetry breaking @xcite , while the latter property is constrained , but still allowed by the conformal bootstrap @xcite .",
    "if both these conditions are met , strong renormalization effects in the hidden sector can suppress the soft masses of the scalars ( including @xmath3 @xcite and @xmath4 @xcite ) , an idea more generally known as `` conformal sequestering '' or `` scalar sequestering '' @xcite .",
    "we will demonstrate that with such a strongly coupled hidden sector , even the very simplest example for the messenger sector yields a large viable parameter space .",
    "the simplicity of our model contrasts sharply with most fully weakly - coupled solutions , which address the @xmath2/@xmath3 problem by elaborately extending either the higgs sector or the messenger sector ( or both ) .    in recent years",
    ", there has been tremendous progress in our understanding of 4d conformal field theory , starting with the work of @xcite .",
    "this revival of the conformal bootstrap program has led to strong bounds on the dimensions of operators appearing in the ope . applying these bounds to the operators responsible for susy - breaking",
    "has in turn strongly limited the efficacy of the conformal sequestering scenario @xcite .",
    "in particular , it is now very difficult to achieve full suppression of @xmath3 and @xmath11 , @xmath12 on the other hand , a _ partial _ suppression of the dangerous contributions such that @xmath13 is still possible and may be sufficient to facilitate electroweak symmetry breaking . in this case",
    "the details of the hidden sector dynamics do not fully decouple from the low energy observables , and testing for viable electroweak symmetry breaking requires a robust framework to explicitly compute the mssm soft parameters in terms of the hidden sector data ( such as the spectrum of operators , their scaling dimensions , and their ope coefficients ) .",
    "general messenger higgs mediation ( gmhm ) , developed recently in @xcite , provides precisely such a framework .",
    "following @xcite , the idea of gmhm is to go beyond the single - sector frameworks of @xcite and explicitly separate the messenger sector and susy - breaking sector , so that it becomes possible to take @xmath14 .",
    "specifically , we parametrize the coupling between the messenger sector and the susy - breaking hidden sector via a perturbative superpotential interaction as in @xcite : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is an operator in the susy - breaking sector with dimension @xmath17 , @xmath18 is an operator in the messenger sector , and @xmath19 is the cut - off scale associated with the irrelevant operator in ( [ eq : whm ] ) . the complete setup of gmhm is shown in figure [ gmhmdiagram ] . by expanding in the portal couplings @xmath20 , @xmath21 of ( [ eq : wud ] ) and ( [ eq : whm ] ) , we can express the soft parameters in terms of products of separate correlation functions over the messenger sector and the hidden sector . under the assumption that the hidden sector is near a conformal fixed point between the scales @xmath9 and @xmath10 ,",
    "the correlators simplify dramatically .",
    "the gmhm formalism then allows , for the first time , for a full calculation of soft masses directly in terms of hidden sector scaling dimensions , ope coefficients , and expectation values .",
    ", scaledwidth=85.0% ]    although gmhm applies to any hidden sector and messenger sector coupled through the portals ( [ eq : wud ] ) , ( [ eq : whm ] ) , in this paper we will focus on weakly - coupled messenger sectors in order to preserve calculability and predictivity .",
    "( while allowing for arbitrary @xmath17 ) , which is well motivated for a weakly coupled messenger sector .",
    "this explains the powers of @xmath19 or lack thereof implicitly taken in ( [ eq : wud ] ) and ( [ eq : whm ] ) .",
    "] we will explore the phenomenology of this entire class of models , as well as present a very simple explicit example . concretely",
    ", the model for the messenger sector that we consider is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , @xmath26 are @xmath27 doublets and gauge singlets respectively .",
    "although this model is the prime example of a model that does _ not _ solve the @xmath28 problem when the hidden sector is trivial @xcite , with partial hidden - sector sequestering it becomes an elegant solution to both the @xmath28 and @xmath29 problems .",
    "we find that electroweak symmetry breaking and @xmath30  gev are easy to achieve in this model , and instead the most interesting constraints on the parameter space originate from stau tachyons .",
    "nevertheless there is a large viable parameter space , which can accommodate @xmath31 ope coefficients and roughly 10% suppression from conformal sequestering .",
    "the collider phenomenology is similar to that of standard gaugino mediation @xcite , with all the colored states above 1  tev .",
    "the nlsp is always long - lived , which leads to spectacular collider signatures if the nlsp is a stau .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 is a brief review of the mechanism of conformal sequestering as well as the most important features of the gmhm formalism . in section 3",
    "we discuss the model - independent constraints on the parameter space from weak scale requirements such as ewsb and the higgs mass , prior to presenting a full analysis of our explicit example in section 4 .",
    "section 5 is a short discussion of the collider phenomenology of this class of models .",
    "section 6 contains our conclusions , and we reserve various technical details for the appendices .",
    "in this subsection , we review the calculation of the higgs soft parameters @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 through the gmhm formalism . for the derivation of the various results we refer to @xcite . at the scale @xmath10 , conformal symmetry and supersymmetry are broken by an @xmath34-term expectation value for the hidden sector operator @xmath35 with dimension @xmath17 : @xmath36 to leading order , the dimension - one soft parameters ( gaugino masses , @xmath2 , and @xmath32 ) are only sensitive to this vacuum expectation value .    meanwhile , the dimension - two soft parameters ( sfermion mass - squareds , @xmath3 , and @xmath33 ) are sensitive to the dynamics of the hidden sector .",
    "the leading contribution of such dynamics is packaged in the hidden - sector two - point function @xmath37 \\rangle_h,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the spurion limit , this correlation function simply factorizes into @xmath38 , but in a non - trivial hidden sector this is not necessarily a good approximation . for calculable models of the supersymmetry breaking sector one could address this issue by explicitly evaluating ( [ hidsectwopoint ] ) and then studying its effects on the low energy physics . in this paper",
    "we will take a different approach : we will remain agnostic about the precise mechanism of supersymmetry breaking , but instead assume that the hidden sector is approximately conformal before it breaks susy . in the gmhm framework , the hidden sector correlator in ( [ hidsectwopoint ] ) is always convolved with a short - distance messenger correlator , which then enforces @xmath39 .",
    "it is therefore justified to simplify ( [ hidsectwopoint ] ) by making use of the operator product expansion : @xmath40 where the ellipses denote terms with higher dimension and/or spin .",
    "the supercharges annihilate the unit operator such that the correlation function is reduced to @xmath41\\rangle_h \\approx c |x - x'|^{\\delta - 2 \\delta_h } \\langle q^4{o}_{\\delta}\\rangle_h\\ ] ] where we only keep the leading non - vanishing term in the ope .",
    "dimensional analysis then demands that the @xmath42-term expectation value of @xmath43 takes the form @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the scaling dimension of @xmath43 and @xmath46 is a dimensionless number .",
    "the parameters @xmath46 and @xmath47 are degenerate at the level of our analysis , and to facilitate the notation we thus introduce an ` effective ope coefficient ' : @xmath48 note that @xmath46 ( and therefore @xmath49 ) is a real number , but can have either sign .    to leading order in @xmath21 , the @xmath2 term and the @xmath1-terms",

    "here we have introduced the following notational convenience : @xmath53 where the @xmath54 are the usual soft masses for the higgs fields .",
    "although the higgs sector parameters are generated by the portal ( [ eq : wud ] ) , for the rest of the mssm soft parameters we need a different source . in this paper , we assume that these arise through standard gauge mediation , i.e.  the messenger sector in figure [ gmhmdiagram ] also couples to the mssm through gauge interactions . for completeness ,",
    "let us exhibit the usual gauge - mediated contributions to the soft masses .",
    "these can be assembled from the ggm correlators @xmath55 where @xmath56 labels the matter representations of the mssm , and @xmath57 is the quadratic casimir of @xmath56 with respect to the gauge group @xmath58 . in the gmgm formalism the @xmath59 and @xmath60 correlators",
    "can be written as a convolution of a messenger sector correlator with a hidden sector correlator @xcite .",
    "crucially , the hidden sector correlator appearing in the expression for the @xmath60 is precisely ( [ hidsectwopoint ] ) . using the ope",
    ", the expressions for @xmath59 and @xmath60 then reduce to @xmath61j_i(x ) j_i(0)\\big\\rangle_{m } \\log[m^2 x^2]\\label{acor}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the @xmath62 are the bottom components of the current superfields through which the messengers couple to gauge group @xmath58 .",
    "in contrast with ( [ bmucor ] ) and ( [ mhcor ] ) , the expression for sfermion mass - squareds in ( [ acor ] ) is suppressed by an extra loop factor , in addition to any loop factors that may be generated by the messenger correlator itself .      for a generic weakly - coupled messenger sector , all the messenger correlators in equations ( [ eq : mu])-([mhcor ] ) are non - zero at one loop , which implies that @xmath3 and @xmath63 are too large to facilitate viable electroweak symmetry breaking . however just by applying naive dimensional analysis on the correlators in the previous section , we can already identify several possible avenues to address the problem : @xmath64 a well known method to mitigate the infamous loop factor is to increase the messenger number , which we denote by @xmath65 .",
    "however , this is limited by landau poles in the gauge couplings and can not be responsible for completely suppressing the loop factor . secondly ,",
    "if @xmath66 and @xmath14 , the last factor on each line of ( [ dimanmf ] ) can in principle suppress the loop factor . this is the conformal sequestering mechanism .",
    "finally , one could consider an scft with @xmath67 , such that the effective ope coefficient provides the desired suppression factor , possibly in combination with some suppression from sequestering .",
    "meanwhile , from equations ( [ ggmforms])-([acor ] ) we see that since the gaugino and sfermion masses are generated through gauge mediation , they satisfy : @xmath68 in particular , the sfermion masses come with an extra loop factor with respect to @xmath3 and @xmath63 , but are subject to the same suppression from the hidden sector .",
    "this implies that the sfermion masses are always suppressed with respect to the gaugino masses if the @xmath2/@xmath3 and @xmath1/@xmath4 problems are solved .",
    "the phenomenology will therefore be similar to that of gaugino mediation @xcite .",
    "the idealized cases where @xmath69 or @xmath70 lead to the extremely simple boundary conditions at the scale @xmath10 : @xmath71 interestingly , this part of the uv boundary conditions becomes completely model - independent .",
    "the sensitivity of these parameters to the details of the hidden sector and messenger sector has been completely erased .",
    "unfortunately this scenario is severely challenged in several ways .",
    "first , it has been known for some time that achieving suitable ewsb is nontrivial for these boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "second , even if one succeeds in breaking electroweak symmetry , the amount of sequestering through the factor @xmath72 is now severely limited by powerful upper bounds on @xmath73 from the internal consistency of the hidden sector scft @xcite .    to see this ,",
    "consider some reference values in table [ anomalousdim ] , taken from figure 7 of @xcite .",
    "the bounds are clearly very strong for low values of @xmath17 , but could going to larger @xmath17 allow for enough sequestering ?",
    "( this is indeed suggested by figure 9 of @xcite . ) in fact , increasing @xmath17 runs into a competing constraint .",
    "because the messenger sector portal ( [ eq : whm ] ) becomes a higher - dimension operator , it becomes increasingly challenging to achieve realistic gaugino masses . and @xmath32 , which implies that this constraint can not be be simply circumvented by arranging the gaugino masses to arise from a separate source of supersymmetry breaking .",
    "] these are given by ( [ ggmforms ] ) and ( [ bcor ] ) : @xmath74 requiring tev - scale gaugino masses leads to the following rough limit on the suppression that can be achieved from conformal sequestering : @xmath75 where we made the rough order of magnitude estimate @xmath76 tev and defined @xmath77 .",
    "figure [ seqcontourplots ] shows this as a function of @xmath10 and @xmath17 ( with @xmath73 saturating the bootstrap bound ) , for two choices of @xmath78 . for larger @xmath17 , the hierarchy between the messenger and hidden sector scales",
    "is greatly reduced in comparison to the hierarchy that one would obtain in the spurion limit . in combination with the upper bound on @xmath73 from @xcite , this severely limits the amount of sequestering that can be achieved",
    "some more comments on this result :    * equation ( [ gauginoschem ] ) and the requirement that @xmath79 also provide a rough lower bound on @xmath80 .",
    "this is the same type of lower bound as found for any model with weakly coupled messengers , except that in the case at hand the bound is further strengthened for smaller values of @xmath78 and larger values of @xmath17 . * for @xmath81 ,",
    "increasing @xmath17 barely improves the sequestering , because of the competing effects described above . *",
    "the estimate in ( [ gauginoschem ] ) also shows that the achievable sequestering somewhat improves for higher @xmath65 , however the gain is limited due to the @xmath10-dependent upper bound on @xmath65 from landau poles in the gauge couplings .",
    ".maximum allowed value of @xmath73 for selected values of @xmath17 , as extracted from figure 7 of @xcite .",
    "[ anomalousdim ] [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     by comparing figure [ seqcontourplots ] with figure 9 of @xcite , we see that the bound on the sequestering has been strengthened considerably by accounting for tev scale gaugino masses and by factoring in the uv scale @xmath19 , here parametrized by the variable @xmath78 .",
    "in particular , a full loop factor suppression is only feasible for @xmath82 gev . in this case",
    "the separation with the weak scale may be sufficiently high such that mssm rg - running could suffice to generate a large @xmath1-term , without the need for higgs mediation @xcite .",
    "moreover , such a high scale of supersymmetry breaking introduces various subtleties in the model : firstly , the gravitino is no longer the lsp .",
    "while this is interesting if the new lsp is a neutralino @xcite , it is a disaster if the new lsp is a stau .",
    "secondly , for @xmath83 gev , contributions from anomaly and/or gravity mediation may not be negligible .",
    "especially the latter could be problematic , as they generically induce large flavor violation in the @xmath1-terms and the sfermion masses .",
    "( on the other hand , it is possible that the very same mechanism of conformal sequestering may help to suppress dangerous flavor violation @xcite . )",
    "while these are certainly interesting issues , we do not wish to confront them in this paper . for simplicity",
    "we therefore restrict our discussion to @xmath84 gev , to ensure that the gravitino is always the nlsp and that gravity - induced flavor violation is always automatically small .    from figure [ seqcontourplots ] we then conclude that for conformal sequestering is not sufficiently powerful to achieve the fully suppressed boundary conditions in ( [ fullyseq ] ) .",
    "the best we can hope for is to achieve a partial suppression from sequestering given by @xmath85 this may be sufficient  especially in combination with some additional suppression from @xmath86 and/or @xmath87  to achieve viable ewsb , provided that the boundary conditions at the scale @xmath10 still satisfy @xmath88 rather than the overly stringent requirement in ( [ fullyseq ] ) .",
    "such partially suppressed boundary conditions imply that the details of the dynamics in the hidden and messenger sectors are not erased at the scale @xmath10 . instead",
    ", both sectors should leave an observable imprint on the low energy spectrum .",
    "using the gmhm formalism developed in @xcite , we are able for the first time to explicitly evaluate this imprint for a weakly messenger sector of our choice",
    ". we will present an explicit example in section [ example ] , but before doing so , it is useful to study the available parameter space in a ( semi ) model - independent way .",
    "this will be the subject of the next section .",
    "the correlator formalism described in the previous section a priori involves a very large parameter space ; in the most general case the boundary conditions are described by no less than 10 free parameters : @xmath89 with @xmath90 .",
    "( recall from the discussion around equation ( [ eq : gauginosfermion ] ) that the sfermion masses are suppressed at the scale @xmath10 . ) here and onwards , the parameters in ( [ paramspace ] ) are always to be thought of as evaluated at the scale @xmath10 , unless indicated otherwise . following the discussion of the previous section , to maximize the impact of the conformal sequestering we choose @xmath91 gev . at the end of section [ example ]",
    "we briefly comment on lower values for @xmath10 .    before even writing down a specific uv model",
    ", we can restrict this parameter space through phenomenological considerations in the ir such as ewsb and the higgs mass .",
    "this approach has a double advantage : it serves as a valuable intermediate step in the full analysis and provides some model independent information about the uv soft parameters . despite the restrictions from the ir boundary conditions ,",
    "the remaining parameter space in ( [ paramspace ] ) is still rather daunting to analyze in full generality . in this paper , we instead choose to impose one more condition on the uv soft parameters purely for simplicity .",
    "this condition  an extension of messenger parity to the higgs - messenger portal  renders the parameter space in ( [ paramspace ] ) manageable .",
    "moreover it is a property of a broad class of models , and it is motivated in particular by the model we will study in section [ example ] .",
    "the impact of each of the constraints on the soft parameters is summarized in figure [ flowchart ] , and in this section we will describe each one in turn .      in ggm ,",
    "a standard ingredient is that the hidden sector possesses a  messenger parity \" symmetry that forbids dangerous hypercharge tadpoles @xcite . to reduce the size of the parameter space here , we choose to extend this symmetry to the higgs - messenger interactions .",
    "specifically , we assume that messenger parity exchanges @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "this greatly simplifies our analysis , since it implies that the correlators for @xmath94 and @xmath95 in ( [ eq : a ] ) must be identical .",
    "the same is true for the correlators for @xmath96 and @xmath97 in ( [ mhcor ] ) .",
    "the soft parameters must therefore obey the following relation at the scale @xmath10 : @xmath98 we can conveniently use this constraint to eliminate @xmath95 as a free parameter , and thus reduce size of the parameter space .",
    "in addition , ( [ adrelation ] ) determines the relative sign of @xmath94 and @xmath95 , as well as the relative sign of @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "we emphasize that this extension of messenger parity to @xmath92 and @xmath93 is motivated purely on the grounds of convenience ; although messenger parity is usually included in the definition of gauge mediation , in general it does not need to act on @xmath92 and @xmath93 in this specific way .    for any concrete model , the uv soft parameters",
    "must be realized in terms of the underlying parameters of the model , which generally leads to additional restrictions on top of ( [ adrelation ] ) .",
    "for example , a minimal messenger sector with only messengers in a @xmath99-@xmath100 representation of an su(5 ) gut yields the following relation between the gaugino masses : @xmath101 in this section we discuss this special case as well as the more general case where all three gaugino masses are independent . any further restrictions on the uv boundary conditions are typically highly model - dependent , and we deal with them only when we commit to a specific example in section [ example ] .      the restrictions on the ir soft masses are purely given by phenomenological considerations , and as such they are independent of the precise composition of the messenger sector .",
    "in particular , we demand that a realistic spectrum at the weak scale satisfies the following requirements :    1 .   viable electroweak symmetry breaking . 2 .",
    "@xmath0 gev and tev - scale stops .",
    "3 .   charge , color and cp must be unbroken in the vacuum on cosmological time scales .    in what follows",
    ", we will go step by step through the ir constraints mentioned above , and use them to reduce the size of the parameter space until it becomes tractable .",
    "more details on our numerical procedure are given in appendix [ appnumerical ] .",
    "as usual , the tadpole equations in the higgs sector allow us to eliminate @xmath96 and @xmath3 at the weak scale in favor of @xmath102 and @xmath103 . in order not to exacerbate the fine - tuning , we only consider @xmath104 gev , but",
    "this is by no means essential .",
    "this assumption has the additional benefit that the parameter @xmath2 now has little impact on the ir spectrum , with the exception of course of the mass of the higgsino , which may be the nlsp .",
    "a small number of discrete choices therefore suffices to obtain a good qualitative picture of the parameter space .",
    "in addition , we fix @xmath105 .",
    "the parameters @xmath94 and @xmath106 are the most important parameters as far as the mass of the lightest cp even higgs is concerned , as they set the stop @xmath1-term as well as the stop masses . to appreciate the latter ,",
    "consider the system of rg equations @xmath107 where we neglected contributions proportional to @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "we also dropped the dependence on the @xmath2 parameter , since we assumed it to be smaller than the other soft masses .",
    "the key fact is that the stop masses and @xmath96 are essentially zero at the scale @xmath10 ( due to sequestering ) and at the weak scale ( due to ewsb ) , respectively .",
    "therefore , the running of the stops and @xmath96 must be determined primarily by the sources @xmath106 , @xmath110 and @xmath94 . of these parameters",
    ", the effect of @xmath110 is typically subleading compared to the other two .",
    "it is therefore justified to fix the parameters @xmath94 and @xmath106 by insisting on @xmath111 gev with tev - scale stop masses .",
    "may cause our vacuum to decay to a lower , color - breaking vacuum on a time scale shorter than the age of the universe .",
    "the recently improved empirical constraint on this process @xcite does not impact the parameter space plotted in figure [ moneyplot1 ] .",
    "( see also @xcite for similar recent results . ) ] this is illustrated in figure [ moneyplot1 ] for some representative values of @xmath110 .",
    "given both the theory and the experimental errors on the higgs mass , this is necessarily a somewhat loose constraint , and for the purpose of our analysis , we simply choose a representative point in the allowed region , indicated with a star in figure [ moneyplot1 ] .",
    "other choices are certainly possible , but the qualitative features of what will follow are preserved .      having fixed @xmath94 and @xmath106 from requiring tev - scale stops and @xmath0 gev , we are left with just the independent parameters @xmath112 , @xmath110 and @xmath97 ( see figure [ flowchart ] ) .",
    "all of these will be constrained by requiring the absence of slepton tachyons .",
    "since the yukawa interaction pushes the sleptons down in the rg running , the third generation is always the most constraining .",
    "the relevant rg equations are does not exhibit strong rg running and can usually be approximated fairly well by its uv value .",
    "the story is very different for the stau masses : although in absolute terms their rg running is small as well , their uv threshold value is highly suppressed and the running therefore provides the dominant contribution to the ir stau masses . ]",

    "given that @xmath116 , we neglect all the terms proportional to @xmath117 , except for @xmath118 , which may be very large .",
    "the right - handed stau is the more fragile of the two staus , since its mass is not sensitive to the upwards pull of @xmath110 .",
    "moreover recall that @xmath96 and @xmath95 have already been fixed by ewsb plus the higgs mass constraint and the extension of messenger parity , respectively .",
    "the most interesting slicing of the parameter space is therefore in terms of @xmath112 and @xmath97 .",
    "this is shown in the plots in figure [ general_master_plot ] , and we now proceed to discuss these plots in more detail .. this is because @xmath96 ( at the scale @xmath10 ) is positive for our choices of @xmath106 , @xmath110 and @xmath94 , and our simplifying assumption about messenger parity relates the sign of @xmath97 to that of @xmath96 through equation ( [ adrelation ] ) . ]",
    "let us first consider the case where @xmath110 is held fixed , as shown in figure [ masterlowm2 ] and figure [ masterhighm2 ] for two representative values of @xmath110 .",
    "* since @xmath97 pushes down @xmath119 in the rge , as @xmath97 is increased , it eventually results in a snutau tachyon .",
    "this is indicated by the red shaded region in figure [ masterlowm2 ] .",
    "this is less of an issue for larger @xmath110 , which is why there is no analogous constraint from snutau tachyons in figure [ masterhighm2 ] .",
    "* for smaller @xmath112 , either the @xmath120-term or the @xmath118 term drives the right - handed stau tachyonic .",
    "this is indicated by the green shaded regions in figure [ general_master_plot ] . *",
    "another interesting feature in figure [ masterlowm2 ] and figure [ masterhighm2 ] is that @xmath95 is fairly independent of @xmath112 and monotonically increases as a function of @xmath97 .",
    "this is a direct consequence of ( [ adrelation ] ) and the fact that ( as we just discussed ) @xmath96 is basically constant in these plots . *",
    "a final noteworthy special case occurs if @xmath121 , as the lightest stau mass eigenstate may be predominantly composed out of the left - handed stau , due to the smaller coefficient for the @xmath122 term in ( [ staul ] ) compared to its analogue in ( [ staur ] ) .    in models with only @xmath99-@xmath100 messengers ,",

    "for instance , we find that the gluino and the stops should be heavier than @xmath205  gev and @xmath206  gev respectively .",
    "according to the preceding discussion of the colored spectrum ( see again figure [ moneyplot1 ] ) , this is not a very stringent constraint on these models , where the gluinos and stops are already heavy to begin with .",

    "the collider phenomenology of a detector stable higgsino nlsp is essentially identical to that of a higgsino lsp in gravity mediation models .",

    "if the other states decouple , the only robust bound comes from lep , and requires the charged higgsino component to be heavier than @xmath209 gev @xcite .",

    ", this class of models counters the disastrous @xmath210 enhancement of @xmath3 and @xmath4 by a suppression from strong dynamics in the hidden sector .",

    "accounting for the bounds on the anomalous dimension from the conformal bootstrap program @xcite , we make a general estimate of the impact of conformal sequestering for this class of models and validate our estimate in an explicit example . in either case ,",
    "conformal sequestering is insufficient to produce a full loop factor suppression , but a suppression of roughly one order of magnitude is possible if @xmath211 gev . in this case",
    "viable electroweak symmetry breaking can be achieved for effective ope coefficients roughly between 1 and 0.1 , depending on the details of the messenger sector .",
    "it is still an open question whether the upper bound on @xmath73 from the bootstrap program can be saturated , as currently no examples are known .",
    "such an example would necessarily need to be strongly coupled , as weakly coupled scft s were shown not to produce the required inequalities for the scaling dimensions of the operators @xcite .",
    "an important and generic feature of this class of models is that the suppression from conformal sequestering is only appreciable for @xmath10 as high as roughly @xmath179 gev .",
    "from this fairly high scale of supersymmetry breaking one would expect a degree of fine - tuning of roughly 1 in @xmath212 at best , and a priori the tuning may be aggravated by large cancellations in the uv boundary conditions , as is the case in higgs mediation models without appreciable hidden sector dynamics . in most of the parameter space of our example",
    "such large cancellations do not occur , indicating that the tuning estimates from the high scale rg running are a fair estimate of the total tuning of the model .",
    "the model therefore constitutes a solution to the `` little @xmath1/@xmath4 problem '' as presented in @xcite , although a moderate price in tuning had to be paid from the higher supersymmetry breaking scale .",
    "this problem would be alleviated to some degree by considering lower values @xmath10 , where the suppression of the loop factor must be obtained from the smallness of the effective ope coefficient rather than from the conformal sequestering . , it may also lose much of its predictivity and calculability . ] at this point it is not clear whether such small ope coefficients can be achieved in a realistic model .",
    "the conformal bootstrap program has resulted in interesting lower bounds on ope coefficients , provided that there is a gap in the spectrum of operators @xcite .",
    "implicitly , we assumed the existence of such a gap by truncating the ope after the leading term , and it seems plausible that our scenario may be constrained from this end as well .",
    "a detailed quantitative analysis of this type of constraint is beyond the scope of this paper , but is certainly worth exploring .",
    "even if very small ope coefficients could be made compatible with the bootstrap constraints , within our simple example , we found it very challenging to find viable solutions with @xmath201 gev .",
    "but we strongly suspect that even extending the model slightly would allow for many more solutions with low @xmath10 .",
    "a broader question which is also interesting is whether it is possible to completely cover the rest of the parameter space in ( [ paramspace ] ) .",
    "it is encouraging that even with our simple example we were able to sample a large part of it .",
    "we therefore suspect that it should be possible to cover the full parameter with a set of perturbative messenger models . here",
    "are some promising ideas in this direction .",
    "first we could relax our assumption on the action of the messenger parity on @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "for instance , one could consider multiple portals between the messenger sector and the mssm higgs sector , of the form : @xmath213 another idea would be to allow for portals of the form @xmath214 where @xmath120 is a gauge singlet .",
    "this is interesting since the singlet portal does not generate @xmath32 and @xmath63 at the same loop order as @xmath2 and @xmath3 @xcite and therefore provides a clean way to untangle these two soft parameters from the others .",
    "finally , in our simple model we assumed @xmath99-@xmath215 messengers .",
    "a model including @xmath216-@xmath217 messengers ( as in @xcite ) would offer more parametric freedom .    in our analysis",
    "we restricted ourselves to @xmath84 gev in order to avoid problems with charged lsps and to automatically eliminate planck - induced flavor violation .",
    "however it is conceivable that with enough assumptions about the hidden sector , conformal sequestering could also suppress dangerous planck - induced operators @xcite .",
    "if this is true , then our model could be extended beyond @xmath218 gev ( at least with the higgsino being the lsp ) .",
    "such a scenario deserves further study , especially since with larger @xmath10 , the impact of the conformal sequestering can be further enhanced beyond what we have found in this paper .",
    "the collider phenomenology in this class of models is generically similar to the phenomenology of gaugino mediation with large @xmath1-terms and depends strongly on the nature of the nlsp .",
    "if the nlsp is the higgsino , the phenomenology is similar to that of a neutralino lsp .",
    "the constraints on this scenario are currently rather weak and prospects for the 14 tev run depend heavily on the spectrum of the colored states . on the other hand ,",
    "if the nlsp is a stau , our model is already strongly constrained by current searches . moreover , in this case direct stop production would be a spectacular channel at the 14 tev run of the lhc , which should allow us to definitively test this scenario .",

    "their notation is somewhat different from ours , and the @xmath226 and @xmath227 in equation ( 22 ) of @xcite correspond to @xmath228 with this change of notation in ( [ labelmhspurion ] ) , our expression for @xmath63 becomes @xmath229 with @xmath230 the magnitude of our expression agrees with equation ( 22 ) in @xcite , however we disagree on the sign .",
    "we find @xmath231 and since the higgs fields can be considered as pseudomoduli in a model with only fields of r - charge 0 and 2 , we have confidence in our result @xcite .    the second interesting special limit is when @xmath154 and @xmath155 , as in this case @xmath2 and @xmath32 vanish at one loop .",
    "the superpotential reduces now to @xmath232 with @xmath233 and @xmath234 .",
    "the model now has an enhanced discrete symmetry : @xmath235 which forbids the correlators ( [ eq : mu ] ) and ( [ eq : a ] ) at the one loop level is irrelevant . ] since the operator @xmath236 is odd under ( [ discretesym ] ) .",
    "this feature may be useful when attempting to cover the full gmhm parameter space with weakly coupled models for the messenger sector .",
    "our general philosophy is to front - load the part of the calculation that involves integrating the rge s , and delay the implementation of the model - specific boundary conditions as long as possible .",
    "this allows us to study various tachyons and ewsb requirements in terms of the familiar soft parameters , rather than the somewhat unintuitive parameters @xmath21 , @xmath49 etc .",
    "this approach also should allow for a more straightforward generalization to other models , since the model - independent , more time consuming steps are performed first . concretely , we parametrize our scan in terms of the independent variables @xmath237 where all parameters are specified at the scale @xmath10 , except the pole mass of the pseudoscalar @xmath238 .",
    "we choose the latter rather than @xmath165 such that our scan is maximally compatible with the inputs that must be provided to ` softsusy-3.3.9 ` @xcite . for the case where the messengers fit into @xmath99-@xmath100 representations , we solve for @xmath110 from the outset by using ( [ gauginorelation ] ) .",
    "our method can be further broken down in the following steps :    1 .",
    "for a given choice of ( [ params2 ] ) , ` softsusy-3.3.9 ` computes the rg - running and imposes the ewsb conditions , a procedure which results in a value for @xmath96 and @xmath97 at the scale @xmath10 .",
    "furthermore we determine @xmath95 as a function of the other soft parameters by imposing ( [ adrelation ] ) .",
    "since ( [ adrelation ] ) involves @xmath96 and @xmath97 , this must be done through an iterative procedure , which we repeat until convergence is achieved . at this point",
    "we are done with integrating the rge s , and there is no more need to run ` softsusy-3.3.9 ` in the remainder of the calculation .",
    "2 .   at this stage",
    "we can express @xmath144 as a function of @xmath110 , @xmath239 and @xmath240 . at the level of finding a solution for the boundary conditions , the variables @xmath49 , @xmath65 and @xmath150 are degenerate .",
    "we therefore define an auxiliary variable @xmath241 to simplify the solution finding procedure . solving the uv boundary conditions specified in ( [ simplemu ] ) , ( [ simplea ] ) ,",
    "( [ simplebmu ] ) and ( [ simplemh ] ) thus corresponds to solving 6 algebraic equations in terms of the 5 variables @xmath21 , @xmath239 , @xmath240 and @xmath242 . in the previous step we already eliminated @xmath95 by solving ( [ adrelation ] ) through the iterative procedure",
    "this leaves us with 5 equations with 5 unknowns , and a much better chance of obtaining a viable solution than if we would have attacked all 6 equations at once .",
    "this translates into a much improved computation time per point than if we would have performed a brute force scan over @xmath21 , @xmath239 , @xmath240 and @xmath242 . next we can isolate",
    "a simple set of two equations by taking a clever combination of the boundary conditions : @xmath243 this system of equations is independent of @xmath21 and @xmath242 and can be solved analytically for @xmath240 . at this point",
    "we have to commit to a concrete choice of @xmath73 , after which we can solve the remaining equation for @xmath239 numerically .",
    "3 .   now that we have solved for @xmath239 and @xmath240 for a given choice of @xmath73",
    ", it is trivial to solve the remaining boundary conditions for @xmath21 and @xmath242 . at this point",
    "we discard the solution if any of these parameters does not have a real solution , if @xmath244 , if @xmath245 or if @xmath246 .",
    "these cuts are chosen arbitrarily to ensure no non - physical solutions where kept .",
    "we verified that the results are not sensitive to the precise value of these cuts .",
    "in the final step we recover @xmath135 from ( [ bino ] ) and table [ anomalousdim ] , and use this to unpack @xmath242 in terms of the suppression factor from conformal sequestering and the effective ope coefficient @xmath49 . at this step",
    "we also must commit to a choice of messenger number @xmath65 .",
