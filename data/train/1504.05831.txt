    "the resolution of this signal peak is improved by using @xmath82 instead of @xmath83 in @xmath84 .",
    "an additional improvement in resolution is achieved for @xmath85 decays by taking bremsstrahlung into account : the four - momentum of the signal electron candidate is corrected by the addition up to photon below an energy of 1gev within a five degree cone around the direction of its momentum . for the signal extraction , the region with @xmath86 around the signal peak",

    "muons are identified from charged tracks extrapolated to the outer detector ; the difference between the expected and measured penetration depth of the track as well as the transverse deviation of klm hits from the extrapolated track are used to distinguish muons from hadrons  @xcite . adding the particle i d to the final selection , 95% ( 99% ) of events with a wrong - lepton hypothesis are vetoed with a reduction in signal selection efficiency of about 2% ( 1.2% ) for the muon ( electron ) channel .",
    "the analysis is performed with two energy thresholds of 1gev and 400mev for the signal photon candidate in the @xmath79 rest frame , where the most energetic photon in the @xmath79 rest frame is identified as the signal photon candidate .",
    "the 1gev threshold is a lower bound for which the theoretical model is valid ; however , a secondary analysis covering a larger phase space is performed , with a 400mev bound chosen to remove the divergent part in the decay model at lower energies .",
    "the missing momentum in the event @xmath94 has to be above 800mev/@xmath93 in the @xmath79 rest frame , to be consistent with the presence of a high energy neutrino .",
    "events in which a signal photon candidate is mis - reconstructed from bremsstrahlung radiation originating from the signal electron are vetoed by requiring that the cosine of the angle between the lepton and photon candidates in the @xmath79 rest frame ( @xmath95 ) lie below 0.6 . for the cosine of the angle between the missing momentum and the signal photon candidate in the @xmath79 rest frame ( @xmath96 ) a discrepancy is observed between mc and data for values below @xmath97 in the sideband of @xmath98 ; therefore @xmath96 is selected to be larger than @xmath97 .",
    "the remaining energy in the ecl is the summed energy of clusters not associated with signal or tag - side particles and is required to be below 900mev . here",
    ", clusters are required to have energies above of 50 , 100 , and 150mev for the barrel , forward , and backward end - cap calorimeter , respectively . these energy thresholds with directional dependence",
    "are proven to veto background in the detector not related to physical processes .    to suppress the main background of @xmath55 decays , a @xmath99 veto is constructed that combines the signal photon candidate with all remaining photons in the ecl above an energy of 100mev to compute the invariant mass , where only the candidate closest to the nominal @xmath99 mass is kept .",
    "a @xmath99 mass is only computed if at least one remaining photon above an energy of 100mev is left in the ecl . the number of events with a computed @xmath99 mass decreases with a rising energy threshold , as does the number of events vetoed by a selection on the resulting mass spectrum . on the other hand ,",
    "an increasing energy threshold improves the signal and background separation since fewer photons are combined with the signal photon candidate .",
    "this reduces the possibility of calculating a @xmath99 mass close to the correct one by chance .",
    "the 100mev threshold is chosen to ensure a high signal efficiency of about 99% while achieving a good background rejection of 45% for @xmath55 processes , when a window of 30mev/@xmath48 around the nominal @xmath99 mass is vetoed .    the overall signal selection efficiency after full reconstruction is 47% ( 45% ) for the muon ( electron ) channel .",
    "the expected event numbers from the background mc samples are : 328 ( 299 ) for @xmath100 decays , 78 ( 76 ) for @xmath101 decays , and 17 ( 6 ) events from non - resonant @xmath102 processes for the muon ( electron ) channel .",

    "these are computed in the same way as for the selection above but with different energy thresholds on the remaining photons in the ecl .",
    "the thresholds are increased in 10mev steps from 20 to 100mev .",
    "the number of photons combined with the signal photon candidate depends on this energy threshold , and since only the combination closest to the nominal mass is taken into account , different photon combinations end up in the mass spectrum .",
    "this leads to different invariant mass spectra with complementary information .",
    "the @xmath104 invariant mass is computed in the same way , with energy thresholds between 20 and 300mev . only the six most significant meson masses are retained in the training .",

    "for the non - analytical shape obtained from the kernel estimator algorithm , the size of the gaussian kernels is varied to obtain a considerable shape variation .",
    "the systematic error on the meson - veto network is obtained from the control channel @xmath208 . here",
    ", the signal photon candidate is combined with the remaining photon candidates to compute the meson mass spectra and obtain the network output distribution . from this distribution ,",
    "a double ratio of data and mc is calculated as @xmath209 , where @xmath110 is the event count in the @xmath111 bin and @xmath210 the total number of events . the largest deviation between data and mc",
    "is found to be 8% in the most background - like network output bin .",
    "an alternate model is obtained by using the double ratio values to reweight the binned @xmath106 distribution in @xmath0 . the angles @xmath95 and @xmath96 , as well as the remaining energy in the ecl , can not be used in the nn trained on the control sample .",
    "therefore , a separate network without these variables is trained on the @xmath0 samples , which is then used to obtain the double ratios in the control channel .",
    "the fixed yields of the measured @xmath180 backgrounds are varied by their world - average errors  @xcite . the systematic uncertainty related to the @xmath0 decay signal model",
    "is estimated by comparing the latest nlo model  @xcite with an older lo calculation  @xcite . here , the shape difference in the @xmath106 distribution is found to be small and parametric errors of the theory are also found to have a negligible effect on the branching fraction determination .",
    "the systematic uncertainty related to lepton i d is determined in @xmath211 processes and the error is found to be 2.2% and 5.0% for electrons and muons , respectively .",
    "the error for the tag - side efficiency has been determined in ref .",
    "@xcite to be 4.2% .",
    "the error for the tag - side nn is taken from the sideband @xmath212 , where the difference in the data - mc selection efficiency is taken as a systematic error .",
    "systematic deviations for the tracking efficiency are determined with high transverse momentum tracks from partially reconstructed @xmath213 mesons ; the deviation is @xmath214 .    to obtain the systematic error for the simultaneous fit to both channels ,",
    "all errors are assumed to be fully correlated except for the errors on the fit shapes and the lepton i d , for which no correlation is assumed .",
    "the total systematic error is less than half of the statistical error .",
    "in summary , we report the upper limits of the partial branching fraction with @xmath204 for semileptonic @xmath0 decays with the full belle data set of @xmath215 pairs .",
    "the signal photon energy requirement ensures a reliable theoretical description of the decay process .",
    "the results at 90% credibility level are @xmath216 these results improve the limits measured by babar  @xcite .",
    "the limit of the combined channel @xmath0 translates into a boundary of @xmath205 at 90% credibility level , where this limit evolves within the range @xmath217 by varying the input parameters of the decay width .",
    "a secondary analysis with a lower signal photon energy threshold of @xmath218 gives consistent results .",
