    "other functionals that attain their minimum for the delaunay triangulation in the plane have been studied in @xcite and generalized from finite collections to ( infinite ) delone sets in @xcite .",
    "for example , the rajan functional is defined by mapping a triangle @xmath9 with edges of length @xmath10 to @xmath11 times the area of @xmath9 .",
