    "an opportunity to create anderson localized states of electromagnetic excitations in disordered dielectrics has attracted a great deal of attention during the last two decades.@xcite though the localization of light in three - dimensional uniform - on - average random systems proved to be difficult to achieve , new opportunities opened up with development of the structures with periodically modulated dielectric properties , so called photonic crystals.@xcite it was first suggested in ref . that the photon localization can be more easily achieved if the photon density of states ( dos ) is depleted at certain frequency domains .",
    "photonic crystals allow the creation of photon band - gaps , regions of frequencies where the photon dos is zero . introducing isolated defects in such structures",
    ", one can create local photon modes similar to well known defect phonon modes in regular crystals@xcite or electron impurity states in semiconductors.@xcite a forbidden gap in the photonic spectrum occurs when the electromagnetic wave length becomes comparable to the lattice constant .",
    "consequently , for microwave , infrared and visible ranges , the photonic crystal is a structure of macroscopic dimensions .",
    "local states in these structures also arise due to defects of macroscopical dimensions .",
    "the great interest in photonic crystals is promoted by their highly unusual quantum electrodynamic properties .",
    "for instance , spontaneous emission , which is completely suppressed within the frequency range of the band gaps,@xcite can be effectively controlled by introducing local modes.@xcite    the intriguing possibilities of photonic crystals initiated interest in optical effects in other types of photonic band - gaps .",
    "such gaps can arise , for example , between different polariton branches .",
    "the fact that the frequency region between polariton branches can represent a stop - band for electromagnetic waves propagating in certain directions has been well known for a long time .",
    "the reflection coefficient in this situation can reach the magnitude of 90 percent or even greater .",
    "this effect was used in the 40 s and 50 s in order to create monochromatic infrared beams ( it was called the method of residual or reststrahlen rays , and the respective spectral interval was called the reststrahlen region ) . in certain cases , however ,",
    "the stop bands exist for all the directions , and then a genuine spectral gap arises with the same consequences for quantum electrodynamics as in the case of photonic crystals .",
    "this was first realized in ref . , where it was shown that a two - level atom can form an atom - field coupled states with suppressed emission similar to the states discussed in ref . for photonic crystals .",
    "periodic arrangement of such two - level systems produces an impurity - induced polariton band within the polariton gap.@xcite    local polariton states associated with a regular isotopic defect without any intrinsic optical activity were introduced in refs . .",
    "these states are coupled states of electromagnetic excitations with phonons ( or excitons ) , with both components , including the electromagnetic component , being localized in the vicinity of the defect .",
    "these states are , in a certain sense , analogous to local photons in photonic crystals considered in refs . , although they arise due to microscopic impurities in regular crystal lattices . on the other hand ,",
    "local polaritons can be considered as local excitations of a crystal coupled with the electromagnetic field .",
    "regular local phonons ( excitons ) also interact with the electromagnetic field , but this interaction results mainly in absorption of light and radiative decay of the states.@xcite the local polaritons arise in the region where electromagnetic waves do not propagate , and there are , therefore , neither defect induced absorption of light nor radiative damping of the local states .",
    "the electromagnetic interaction leads in this case to new optical effects , and strongly affects the properties of the local states .",
    "it is well known , for instance , that local phonons or excitons in a 3d system ( as well as local photons in photonic crystals ) arise only if the `` strength '' of a defect exceeds a certain threshold .",
    "local polaritons in systems with an isotropic dispersion split off the allowed band without a threshold even in three dimensions.@xcite this effect is caused by the interaction with electromagnetic field , which results in the van - hove singularity in the polariton dos .",
    "one of the optical effects caused by local polaritons is resonant tunneling of electromagnetic wave with gap frequencies .",
    "this effect was first suggested in ref . , where the results of numerical simulation of electromagnetic wave propagation through a relatively short 1d chain with a single defect were reported .",
    "it was found that the transmission coefficient at the frequency of the local polariton state increases dramatically up to the a value close to unity . in spite of the general understanding that local states should produce local tunneling , this result still seems surprising because transmission of light is effected by a defect with microscopic dimensions much smaller than the light s wavelength .",
    "in addition , the energy of the electromagnetic component of local polaritons is much smaller than that of the phonon component .",
    "traditional wisdom based upon properties of conventional propagating polaritons tells that , in such a situation , most of the incident radiation must be simply reflected .",
    "the results of ref . demonstrated that this logic does not apply to local polaritons .",
    "the physical explanation of the result can be given on the basis of consideration of local polaritons as the result of interaction between electromagnetic field and local phonons .",
    "the latter have macroscopic dimensions comparable with light s wavelength , making the interaction effective .",
    "an electromagnetic wave is carried through a sample by phonons , which is tunneling resonantly due to the local state with mostly phonon contribution .",
    "tunneling was confirmed in refs . , where we analytically calculated the transmission coefficient through a linear chain with a single defect .",
    "we found that a light impurity indeed gives rise to the resonance transmission through the forbidden gap of the polariton spectrum .",
    "the resonance occurs when the defect is placed at the center of the chain .",
    "the transmission at the resonance becomes independent of the chain s length and reaches the value of unity if the resonance frequency coincides with the center of the polariton gap .",
    "the analytical calculations provided an explanation for the numerical results of ref .",
    ", in particular it explained a strongly asymmetrical frequency profile of the transmission coefficient , and the presence of a deep minimum following directly after the maximum .    analytical calculations in ref .",
    "were supplemented with numerical simulations of the electromagnetic wave transmission through the chain with a finite concentration of impurities .",
    "the simulations demonstrated the development of a defect - induced polariton band within the forbidden polariton gap . in this paper , we present results of an analytical study of properties of this band . neglecting spatial dispersion of phonons , we are able to obtain analytical expressions for dos and the lyapunov exponent for the band in the limit of large concentration of impurities @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the average distance between impurities , and @xmath2 is the localization length of the single local polariton state . in this limit",
    "the method of microcanonical ensemble , complemented by expansion over @xmath3 gives the dos of an effective system with a uniform distribution of impurities , and describes its renormalization caused by local fluctuations of impurity positions .",
    "it also reveals localization of the states of the band , which are all localized due to the one - dimensional nature of the model .",
    "the properties of this polariton band are found to be drastically different from that of the band produced by two - level atoms.@xcite the analytical results show excellent agreement with numerical calculations and lead to suggestions regarding experimental observation of the impurity induced polariton bands .",
    "the main objective of the present paper is to study properties of the impurity induced polariton band arising within the polariton gap of a one dimensional chain of atoms with dipole moments @xmath4 , where @xmath5 refers to a position of an atom in the chain .",
    "dynamics of the chain interacting with a scalar `` electromagnetic field '' @xmath6 is described within the tight - binding approximation with an interaction between nearest neighbors only , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the parameter of the interaction between the dipoles , @xmath9 is a coupling parameter between the dipoles and the electromagnetic field ,  and @xmath10 represents a site energy .",
    "we shall assume that the chain is composed of atoms of two different types , which differ in their site energy only .",
    "in this case @xmath10 can be presented in the following form : @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are site energies of the respective atoms , and @xmath15 is a random variable which takes values 0 and 1 with probabilities @xmath16 and @xmath17 respectively .",
    "we assume that @xmath18 so that @xmath19 is attributed to host atoms , whereas @xmath20 corresponds to the impurities .",

    ", one can present eq .",
    "( [ maxwell ] ) in a discrete form .",

    "( [ ep ] ) very cumbersome , even in the case of a single impurity . at the same time , numerical simulations carried out in refs",

    "@xmath39    with @xmath40 represents the polarizability of the @xmath5-th dipole .",
    "the main object of interest in studies of one - dimensional disordered systems is the lyapunov exponent ( le ) , @xmath41 , which in our case can be defined as@xcite @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the total length of the chain consisting of @xmath44 atoms .",
    "it is well - known that the quantity defined by eq .",
    "( [ le ] ) is non - random ( self - averages ) .",
    "it characterizes the spatial extent of the envelope of system eigenstates , all of which are localized in one dimension ( see ref . and references therein ) .",
    "the same quantity also describes the typical value of the transmission coefficient , @xmath45 of an external excitation incident upon the system : @xmath46 , and through the thouless relation@xcite it determines the dos of the system .",
    "calculation of le in the spectral region of the polariton gap of the pure system is the main task of this section .",
    "the major problem with calculating of le or dos in the region of impurity bands is that a simple concentration expansion is not able to describe the impurity band .",
    "electron and phonon impurity bands have been intensively studied in the past ( see , for example , ref . ) . in the limit of extremely small concentration of impurities ,",
    "@xmath47 it was proved possible to provide a regular systematic of the arising states and use statistical arguments to describe their dos.@xcite another method used for this type of calculations employed the so - called phase formalism ( see ref . and references therein ) .",
    "this approach allowed one to calculate dos of impurity bands in different spectral regions , including exponential behavior at the tails of the band for both small and large , @xmath48 concentrations . in the case of local polaritons",
    "the localization length , @xmath2 , of an individual local state can be so large that one has to deal with the situation described by the latter inequality even in the case of a rather small concentration of impurities .",
    "therefore , in this paper we focus mainly upon the properties of the well - developed polariton impurity band when individual local states are overlapped . to this end we use the method of the microcanonical ensemble , which was first suggested for analytical calculations of le in a one - dimensional single - band model of a disordered alloy.@xcite the advantage of this method over other methods of dos calculations is that it allows one to calculate simultaneously both dos and the localization length .",
    "its main shortcoming is that , as we shall see later , this method is a version of `` effective media '' methods , and as such it is unable to describe dos near fluctuation boundaries of the spectrum .",
    "at the same time the results obtained allow a clear physical interpretation and , as follows from comparison with numerical simulations , they quite accurately describe properties of the bulk of the impurity band .",
    "the starting point of our calculations is the general definition of le given by eq .",
    "( [ le ] ) . in spite of le being a self - averaging quantity ,",
    "it is convenient in practical calculations to perform averaging over the random configurations of the impurities .",
    "the regular ensemble of the realization is described by the fixed concentration of the impurities @xmath49 , while their total number can vary from realization to realization .",
    "therefore one can distinguish two causes for fluctuations : ( 1 ) local arrangements of the impurities and ( 2 ) the total number of the impurities .",
    "the main idea of the method of microcanonical ensemble is to reduce the finite size fluctuations in the system , eliminating the fluctuations of the total number of impurities .",
    "such an ensemble with a fixed number of impurities is called the microcanonical ensemble in analogy with statistical physics . at the same time",
    "the result of the averaging in the limit @xmath50 should not depend upon the type of ensemble used by virtue of the self - averaging nature of le .",
    "the key idea of the microcanonical method is based on the assumption that with one cause of fluctuations eliminated , one can obtain reliable results when the microcanonical ensemble average of @xmath51 is replaced by @xmath52 .",
    "such a substitution gives an exact result in the case of commutating matrices , and leads to an excellent agreement between analytical calculations and simulations in the case of @xmath36 matrices with a single band spectrum.@xcite    using the microcanonical ensemble , one can evaluate the average over all matrix sequences using the following expression derived in ref .",
