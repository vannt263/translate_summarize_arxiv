    "erasure codes can be used in data storage systems that encode and disperse information to multiple storage nodes in the network ( or multiple disks inside a large data center ) , such that a user can retrieve it by accessing only a subset of them .",
    "this kind of systems is able to provide superior availability and durability in the event of disk corruption or network congestion , at a fraction of the cost of the current state of art storage systems based on simple data replication .",
    "when data is coded by an erasure code , data repair becomes more involved , because the information stored at a given node may not be directly available from any one of the remaining storage nodes .",
    "one key issue that affects the overall system performance is the total amount of information that the remaining nodes needs to transmit to the new node .",
    "dimakis _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed the framework of regenerating codes to address the tradeoff between the storage and repair bandwidth in erasure - coded distributed storage systems . in this framework , the overall system consists of @xmath1 storage nodes situated in different network locations , each with @xmath2 units of data , and the content is coded in such a way that by accessing any @xmath3 of these @xmath1 storage nodes , the full data content of @xmath4 units can be completely recovered .",
    "when a node fails , a new node may access any @xmath5 remaining nodes for @xmath6 units of data each , in order to regenerate a new data node .",
    "the main result in @xcite is for the so - called functional - repair case , where the regenerating process does not need to exactly replicate the original data stored on the failed node , but only needs to guarantee that the regenerated node can serve the same purpose as the lost node , _",
    "i.e. _ , data reconstruction using any @xmath3 nodes , and being able to help regenerate new data nodes to replace subsequently failed nodes .",
    "it was shown that this problem can be cleverly converted to a network multicast problem , and the celebrated result on network coding @xcite can be applied directly to provide a complete characterization of the optimal bandwidth - storage tradeoff .",
    "furthermore , linear network codes @xcite are sufficient to achieve this optimal performance .    the decoding and repair rules for functional - repair regenerating codes may evolve as nodes are repaired , which increases the overhead of the system .",
    "moreover , functional - repair does not guarantee systematic format storage , which is an important requirement in practice .",
    "for these reasons , exact - repair regenerating codes have received considerable attention recently @xcite , where the regenerated data need to be exactly the same as that stored in the failed node .    the optimal bandwith - storage tradeoff for the functional - repair case can clearly serve as an outer bound for the exact - repair case .",
    "there also exist code constructions for the two extreme cases , _",
    "i.e. _ , the minimum storage regenerating ( msr ) point @xcite , or the minimum bandwidth regenerating ( mbr ) point @xcite , and the aforementioned outer bound is in fact achievable at these two extreme points .",
    "the achievability of these two extreme points immediately implies that for the cases @xmath7 , the functional - repair outer bound is tight for the exact repair case . also relevant",
    "is the fact that symbol extensions are necessary for linear codes to achieve the msr point for some parameter range @xcite , however the msr point can indeed be asymptotically ( in @xmath4 ) achieved by linear codes for all the parameter range @xcite .",
    "it was also shown in @xcite that when @xmath8 , other than the two extreme points and a segment close to the msr point , the majority the functional repair outer bound is in fact not strictly achievable by exact - repair regenerating codes .",
    "the non - achievability result reported in @xcite was proved by contradiction , _",
    "i.e. _ , a contradiction will occur if one supposes that an exact - repair code operates _ strictly _ on the optimal functional - repair tradeoff curve .",
    "however , it is not clear whether this contradiction is caused by the functional - repair outer bound being only asymptotically achievable , or caused by the existence of a non - vanishing gap between the optimal tradeoff of exact - repair codes and the functional - repair outer bound .",
    "in fact , the necessity of symbol extension proved in @xcite and the asymptotically optimal construction given in @xcite may be interpreted as suggesting that the former is true .    in this work ,",
    "we focus on the simplest case of exact - repair regenerating codes , _",
    "i.e. _ , when @xmath0 , for which the rate region has not been completely characterized previously . a complete characterization of the rate region is provided for this case , which shows that indeed there exists a non - vanishing gap between the optimal tradeoff of the exact - repair codes and that of the functional - repair codes .",
    "the achievability part of this result shows that there exist exact - repair regenerating codes that are better than simply time - sharing between the msr point and the mbr point .    as in many open information theoretical problems ,",
    "the difficulty lies in finding good outer bounds , particularly in this problem with a large number of regenerating and reconstruction requirements .",
    "we rely on a computer - aided proof ( cap ) approach and take advantage of the symmetry and other problem - specific structure to reduce the number of variables in the optimization problem .",
    "this approach builds upon yeungs linear programming ( lp ) framework @xcite . as of our knowledge , this is the first time that the lp framework is meaningfully applied to a non - trivial engineering problem , which leads to a complete solution .",
    "more importantly , instead of only machine - proving whether an information theoretic bound is true or not as in @xcite , we further develop a secondary optimization procedure to find an _ explicit information theoretic proof_. by solving the primary lp optimization problem , the tradeoff curve between the storage and repair bandwidth can be traced out numerically , which leads to the hypotheses of the bounding planes for the rate region .",
    "a secondary optimization procedure , which essentially solves the dual problem for these candidate bounding planes , directly yields an explicit information theoretic proof . due to the duality structure in the lp problem ,",
    "the optimization criterion in the secondary optimization problem can be selected arbitrarily , thus we can choose one that leads to the solution that we most desire . for this purpose , the @xmath9 norm is chosen that approximates the solution under the @xmath10 norm , the latter of which gives the sparsest solution and translates roughly to a converse proof with the least number of steps .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : definition ] , we provide a formal definition of the problem and review briefly the functional - repair outer bound .",
    "the characterization of the rater region is given in section [ sec : main ] , together with the forward and converse proof .",
    "section [ sec : cap ] provides details on the computed - aid proof approach , and section [ sec : conclusion ] concludes the paper .",
    "in this section we first give a formal definition of the regenerating code problem for the case @xmath0 , and then introduce some notation useful for the converse proof .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , we were not able to find such a formal definition in the existing literature , and thus believe it is beneficial to include one here ( which can be generalized to other parameters ) . the functional - repair outer bound is briefly reviewed and specialized to the case under consideration .",
    "a @xmath11 exact - repair regenerating code is formally defined as follows , where the notation @xmath12 is used to denote the set @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is used to denote the cardinality of a set @xmath15 .",
    "[ def : nkkcode ] an @xmath16 exact - repair regenerating code for the @xmath11 case consists of @xmath17 encoding functions @xmath18 , @xmath17 decoding functions @xmath19 , @xmath20 repair encoding functions @xmath21 , and @xmath17 repair decoding functions @xmath22 , where @xmath23 each of which maps the message @xmath24 to one piece of coded information , @xmath25 each of which maps @xmath26 pieces of coded information stored on a set @xmath15 of nodes to the original message , @xmath27 each of which maps a piece of coded information at node @xmath28 to an index that will be made available to reconstruct the data at node @xmath29 , and @xmath30 each of which maps 3 such indices from the helper nodes to reconstruct the information stored at the failed node .",
    "the functions must satisfy the data reconstruction conditions@xmath31 and the repair conditions @xmath32    in the above definition , @xmath33 is the cardinality of the message set , and @xmath34 is essentially @xmath4 .",
    "similarly @xmath35 is essentially @xmath2 and @xmath36 is @xmath6 . to include the case when the storage - bandwidth tradeoff may be approached asymptotically , _",
    "e.g. _ , the codes considered in @xcite , the following definition which utilized a normalized version of @xmath2 and @xmath6 is further introduced .",
    "a normalized bandwidth - storage pair @xmath37 is said to be @xmath11 exact - repair achievable if for any @xmath38 there exists an @xmath16 exact - repair regenerating code such that @xmath39 the collection of all the achievable @xmath37 pairs is the achievable region @xmath40 of the @xmath11 exact - repair regenerating codes .",
    "the reconstruction condition ( [ eqn : reconstructionzeroerror ] ) requires that there is no decoding error , _",
    "i.e. _ , the zero - error requirement is adopted .",
    "an alternative definition is to require instead the probability of decoding error to be asymptotically zero as @xmath41 .",
    "it will become clear from the rate region characterization given in the sequel that this does not cause any essential difference , and thus we do not give this alternative definition to avoid repetition .      in order to derive the outer bound ,",
    "it is convenient to write the reconstruction and regenerating conditions in the form of entropy constraints . for this purpose ,",
    "some further notation is introduced here , which is largely borrowed from @xcite .",
    "let us denote the message random variable as @xmath42 , which is uniformly distributed in the set @xmath43 .",
    "define @xmath44 thus we have the following random variables in the set @xmath45 @xmath46 the reconstruction requirement thus implies that @xmath47 the regenerating requirement implies that @xmath48 and @xmath49 because the message @xmath42 has a uniform distribution , we also have that @xmath50 which is strictly larger than zero . note that together with ( [ eqn : reconstruction ] )",
    ", this implies that @xmath51 the symmetric storage requirement can be written as @xmath52 and the regenerating bandwidth constraint can be written as @xmath53 the above constraints ( [ eqn : reconstruction])-([eqn : beta ] ) are the constraints that need to be satisfied by any exact - repair regenerating codes .",
    "these constraints will be used later in the converse proof .",
    ".[fig : bound433 ] ]      the optimal tradeoff for functional - repair regenerating codes was given by dimakis _",
    "@xcite , which provides an outer bound for the exact - repair case .",
    "the bound has the following form in our notation for the @xmath11 case ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : bound433 ] ) @xmath54 it is not difficult to show that it can be rewritten as the following four simultaneous linear bounds @xmath55 the msr point for this case is @xmath56 , and the mbr point is @xmath57 .",
    "the following theorem provides a complete characterization of the rate region of the @xmath11 exact - repair regenerating codes .",
    "[ theorem : main ] the rate region @xmath40 of the @xmath0 exact - repair regenerating codes is given by the collection of @xmath58 pairs that satisfy the following constraints @xmath59    this rate region is also depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : bound433 ] , together with the functional - repair outer bound .",
    "it is clear that there is a gap between them , and thus the functional - repair outer bound can not be asymptotically achievable under the exact - repair requirement . note that the only difference between the region given in theorem [ theorem : main ] and that in ( [ eqn : frouterbound ] ) is the third bounding plane .",
    "the rate region @xmath40 has three corner points , and thus we only need to show that these three points are all achievable .",
    "the msr point @xmath56 is simply achieved by any @xmath60 mds code , such as the binary systematic code with a single parity check bit .",
    "the mbr point @xmath57 is also easily obtained by using the repair - by - transfer code construction in @xcite , which in this case reduces to a simple replication coding .",
    "it thus only remains to show that the point @xmath61 is also achievable .",
    "next we shall give a construction for a binary @xmath11 code with @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , which indeed achieves this operating point .",
    "the code is illustrated in table [ table : code ] , where ( and in the remainder of this section ) the addition @xmath65 is in the binary field .",
    "here @xmath66 are the systematic bits , @xmath67 , and the remaining bits are the parity bits .",
    "first note that the construction is circularly symmetric , and thus without loss of generality , we only need to consider the case when node 1 fails .",
    "if it can be shown that when node 2 , 3 , 4 each contribute two bits , node 1 can be reconstructed , which also implies that the complete data can be recovered using only node 2 , 3 and 4 , then the proof is complete .",
    "this can indeed be done using the combination shown in table [ table : repair ] .    upon receiving these six bits in table [ table :",
    "repair ] , the new node can form the following combinations @xmath68 where the first combination is formed by using the second bit from node 2 and the first bit from node 3 ( shown in bold ) , and the other combinations can be formed similarly . in the binary field , this is equivalent to having @xmath69 and it is seen that @xmath70 can be recovered by simply taking the difference between ( [ eqn : first ] ) and ( [ eqn : second ] ) , and similarly @xmath71 can be recovered by taking the difference between ( [ eqn : first ] ) and ( [ eqn : third ] ) .",
    "note further that the third bit stored in node 1 is simply the summation of the first bits contributed from node 2 , 3 , and 4 in table [ table : repair ] .",
    "the proof is thus complete .",
    "the hand - crafted code presented above is specific for the @xmath11 case .",
    "however , in a recent work , sasidharan and kumar @xcite discovered a class of codes that is optimal for the @xmath72 case at operating points other than msr or mbr , and specializing it to the @xmath11 case achieves the same performance as the code above ; see also @xcite for a closely related code construction .    .a",
    "@xmath11 code for @xmath61 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     only a small subset of the joint entropy terms are in the solution of this secondary lp problem , as listed in table [ tab : correspondence ] where we also given them labels @xmath73 to facilitate subsequent discussion . here",
    "the letters @xmath74 are used to denote four distinct indices in the set @xmath75 , because by the symmetry , they may assume any order . we can now tabulate the solution of the secondary lp problem , as given in table . [",
    "table : cancellation ] , one row corresponding to one row in @xmath76 , _ i.e. _ , one basic information inequality as shown in table [ table : basicinequalities ] .",
    "the last line in table .",
    "[ table : cancellation ] is the row summation which is indeed @xmath77 .",
    "note that the last inequality of table [ table : basicinequalities ] is also a basic information inequality , but it is not in the form of ( [ eqn : shannontype2 ] ) because some problem specific reduction discussed in the previous sub - section has been incorporated .",
    "though this is already a valid proof , we can manually combine several inequalities to simplify the proof , and the converse proof given in the previous section is the result after such further manual simplifications .    in @xcite",
    ", yeung showed that all unconstrained shannon - type inequalities are linear combinations of elemental shannon - type inequalities , _",
    "i.e. _ , ( [ eqn : shannontype1 ] ) and ( [ eqn : shannontype2 ] ) . the approach we have discussed above can be viewed as a generalization of this result under additional problem - specific constraints . however , the introduction of the @xmath9 norm objective function to approximately find the sparsest linear combination has not been used previously to investigate information inequalities , and thus it is a novel ingredient .",
    "moreover , the proof given in @xcite relies on the fact that all joint entropies can be represented by a linear combinations of the elementary forms of shannons information measures , which are the left hand sides of ( [ eqn : shannontype1 ] ) and ( [ eqn : shannontype2 ] ) .",
    "since our result is regarding the _ tightest _ bounds that can be obtained using the lp approach , the proof directly follows from the strong duality without relying on the completeness of the elementary forms of shannons information measures .",
    "a complete characterization is provided for the rate region of the @xmath11 exact - repair regenerating codes , which shows that the cut - set outer bound @xcite is in general not ( even asymptotically ) tight for exact - repair .",
    "an explicit binary code construction is provided to show that the given rate region is achievable .",
    "one main novelty of the work is that a computer - aided proof approach is developed by extending yeungs linear programming framework , and an explicit information theoretic proof is directly obtained using this approach .",
    "we believe customizing the lp approach to other communication problems based on similar reduction techniques can be a rather fruitful path , which appears particularly suitable for research on storage systems , and thus have presented some related details in this work .",
    "although sparsity is used approximately as an objective in the secondary lp problem , this sparsity is only with respect to the elementary shannon - type inequalities ( [ eqn : shannontype1])-([eqn : shannontype2 ] ) , and thus including more redundant basic shannon - type inequalities may lead to even sparser solution .",
    "this is already evident in the algebraic proof given where manual simplification was taken and some basic inequalities not in ( [ eqn : shannontype1])-([eqn : shannontype2 ] ) were used . including these basic inequalities in the secondary lp will clearly yield a more sparser solution .",
    "it should also be noted that sparsity only translates roughly to a small number of proof steps , but does not necessarily lead to a structured proof that can be extended to general parameter settings .",
    "the result presented in this work revealed that the cut - set outer bound is in general not tight for exact - repair .",
    "though a complete solution for the special case of @xmath11 is given , the rate region characterization problem under general parameters is still open .",
    "readers may wonder if the procedure given in section [ sec : cap ] can be used on the general problem , if it fundamentally alters the complexity order of the primal optimization problem .",
    "unfortunately , although a few more cases with small @xmath78 values can be tackled this way , the complexity is still too high for larger parameter values , and the list of information inequalities involved in the proof is quite large .",
    "in fact , running only the set growth and symmetry determination procedures alone for each variable is of exponential order in the total number of random variables . as an on - going work",
    ", we are investigating whether low complexity procedures exist that can further take into account the symmetry .",
    "through such a general study , we hope to discover more structure in the converse proof which may lead to the complete solution of general @xmath78 exact - repair regenerating codes .    for any @xmath37 that is @xmath11 exact - repair achievable",
    ", there exists for any @xmath38 , an @xmath16 exact - repair regenerating code such that @xmath79 let us for now fix a value @xmath38 , and consider an @xmath16 exact - repair regenerating code satisfy the above conditions , which may or may not induce a symmetric entropy vector . let the encoding and decoding functions be denoted as : @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , as given in definition [ def : nkkcode ] .",
    "we shall show that it can be used to construct an @xmath80 code that induces a symmetric distortion vector , which clearly satisfies ( [ eqn : conditiondefinition ] ) , and the proof will be completed by making @xmath81 arbitrarily small .",
    "let the @xmath82 distinct permutations of @xmath75 be @xmath83 , and let their inverse function be @xmath84 .",
    "the new encoding and decoding functions can be written as @xmath85 because of the symmetry of the new encoding and decoding functions , it is clear by utilizing ( [ wsdefinition ] ) that they indeed induce a symmetric entropy vector , according to definition [ def : symmetricentropy ] .",
    "the zero - error decoding and repair requirements are satisfied because the original code is able to accomplish them .",
