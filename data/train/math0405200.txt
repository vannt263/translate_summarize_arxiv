    "polynomial splines have been extensively used in several applied areas of mathematics such as computer graphics and approximation theory . since the early 90 s , they have been used in control theory , associated to problems of aircraft control and path planning of mechanical systems .",

    "the connection between scalar generalized splines and optimal control was established between 1995 and 1999 .",

    "in this section we give an account of scalar generalized splines , its connection to optimal control , and collect all the necessary results to be used in the sequel .",

    "as we shall see , from an optimal control perspective such a trivial generalization is not the natural way of extending scalar - splines to vector - valued splines .      since the early nineties , in order to deal with applied problems from robotics , there has been an increasing interest to combine spline curves and integral cost problems associated with linear control systems . among theoretical developments",
    ", it was found that scalar generalized splines are minimizers of a simple optimal control problem with a linear time - invariant control system and a single control ( see  @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "this discovery is of crucial importance , because it introduces a new perspective to the subject : scalar spline functions are better viewed as a consequence of the search for an optimal control , rather than a postulate imposed a priori in order to solve particular classes of problems .",
    "given its importance , we summarize the main result here . consider the following autonomous linear - quadratic optimal control problem : @xmath61 where @xmath62 , @xmath63 is the first component of the state vector , @xmath64 , @xmath65 is a scalar function which is @xmath66-smooth in @xmath6 $ ] and @xmath67-smooth in each interval @xmath68 $ ] .",

    "if the first component of the optimal state vector of problem is a scalar generalized spline , the following questions come immediately to our mind : what can be said about the minimizing state trajectory of the optimal control problem ?",
    "is it some sort of a generalized spline in @xmath0 ?",
    "the answer to these questions leads us ( see definition  [ def : vgs : td ] ) to a new time - dependent definition of generalized spline in @xmath0 , which is the main contribution of the present paper .",
    "the general problem of optimal control can be defined , in lagrange form , as follows : @xmath79 = \\int_{t_a}^{t_b } \\mathcal{l}\\left(t , x(t),u(t)\\right)\\,\\mathrm{d}t \\notag \\\\ \\dot{x}\\left(t\\right ) = \\varphi\\left(t , x\\left(t\\right),u\\left(t\\right)\\right ) \\label{eq : prb : pgen}\\\\ \\left(x(t_a),x(t_b)\\right ) = ( \\alpha,\\beta )   \\notag \\\\ x\\left(\\cdot\\right ) \\in w_{1,1}\\left(\\left[t_a , t_b\\right ] ; \\,\\mathbb{r}^{n}\\right ) \\ , \\notag",

    "the standard method to solve is usually based on the deductive approach : ( i ) a solution exists for the problem ; ( ii ) the necessary conditions are applicable , and they identify certain candidates ( so called _ extremals _ ) ; ( iii ) subsequent elimination ( if necessary ) identifies the solution ( or solutions ) .",
    "we are interested in the case where there are no restrictions on the control variables : @xmath84 .",
    "the unrestricted case poses many difficulties , and the problem turns out to be a difficult one , even in special situations . as we explain next , most part of difficulties appear in the application of steps ( i ) and ( ii ) .    the first general answer to ( i ) was given by a. f. filippov in 1959 @xcite , assuming the admissible controls to be integrable ( @xmath85 ) , and the control set @xmath14 to be compact .",
    "as far as we assume @xmath14 to be a noncompact set , filippov s theorem does not apply . to solve the existence problem , we make use of the following theorem ( see @xcite ) .",

    "the existence is assured in the class of integrable controls ( @xmath105 ) , while the formulation of the pontryagin maximum principle assume the optimal controls to be essentially bounded ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "for minimizers predicted by existence theory , theorem  [ teo : pmp ] may fail to be valid , because the values of optimal controls can be unbounded .",

    ", this gives the biggest class of optimal control problems which generalize in a natural way ; do not admit abnormal extremals ( see the next remark ) ; and for which the gap between existence and necessary optimality conditions is automatically closed .",
    "since there is no constraint on the control , singular trajectories are exactly projections of abnormal extremals .",
