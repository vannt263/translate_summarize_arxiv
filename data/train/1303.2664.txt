    "observations of nearby and high - redshift galaxies have shown that star formation in them often leads to galactic winds .",
    "starburst galaxies , with star formation rate ( sfr ) in excess of a few tens of @xmath9 yr@xmath3 are known to excite such outflows . however , heckman ( 2002 ) pointed out that it is not the average sfr , but the sfr surface density which is a deciding factor for the existence of outflows .",
    "he found a threshold sfr surface density of @xmath5 m@xmath6 kpc@xmath7 yr@xmath3 as a prerequisite for starbursts to be able to produce galactic winds .",
    "the standard scenario of star formation leading to the wind phenomena posits that super - starclusters give rise to a large number of supenovae ( sn ) in a relative small region , which can produce a superbubble in the disk and can break out of the disk with enough momentum to produce a wind .",
    "such super - star clusters , or young globular clusters , have been observed to have masses in the range of few @xmath10 m@xmath6 within a typical radius of @xmath11 pc ( ho 1997 ; martn - hernndez 2005 , walcher 2005 ) .",
    "the large amount of energy deposited into the interstellar medium ( ism ) by these objects in the form of uv radiation and mechanical energy is believed to be an important feedback process .",
    "the mechanical energy from these super - starclusters has been shown to be important for the superbubble produced by the combined sne to break out of the disk and produce a large scale wind ( e.g. , tenorio - tagle , silich , muoz - tun 2003 ) .",
    "there have been a number of calculations , both analytical and numerical , dealing with the breakout of superbubbles from disk galaxies .",
    "the conditions for breakout depend strongly on the assumption of the stratification of gas in the disk .",
    "consider an exponentially stratified disk with mid - plane ambient gas pressure @xmath12 , gas density @xmath13 , scale height @xmath14 , and a bubble being blown by mechanical luminosity @xmath15 .",
    "mac low & mccray ( 1988 ) defined a dimensionless parameter @xmath16 , and noticed in their numerical simulations that breakout of bubbles occurred when @xmath17 .",
    "the importance of this parameter can be understood by considering the self - similar evolution of a superbubble driven by an energy injection rate of @xmath15 , given by @xmath18 , and @xmath19 .",
    "this implies a speed of @xmath20 when the superbubble reaches a distance of the scale height , for an ambient gas at a given temperature . according to this criterion , for a scale height @xmath21 pc , and mid - plane gas density @xmath22 g @xmath23 , @xmath24 k @xmath23 , a bubble with total mechanical luminosity of @xmath25 erg  s@xmath3 will be able to breakout of the ism .",
    "basu ( 1999 ) defined a dimensionless parameter @xmath26 which is a ratio of the radius where the mach number of the superbubble becomes unity , to the scale height .",
    "this is motivated by the self - similar solution of a stellar wind , @xmath27 .",
    "they showed that this parameter is related to the above mentioned @xmath28 parameter as @xmath29 .",
    "in other words , a superbubble with @xmath30 is likely to be confined where as blowout will occur for @xmath31 .",
    "koo & mckee ( 1992 ) analytically determined a condition for the breakout .",
    "since the bubbles accelerate after reaching a distance of order the scale height , owing to the rapidly decreasing density , it becomes liable to fragment due to rayleigh - taylor instability .",
    "if the mach number of the bubble at scale height is @xmath32 , then they argued that the bubble would be able to breakout .",
    "they used radiative bubble model of weaver et al ( 1977 ) for a uniform density atmosphere in order to derive a critical mechanical luminosity for which the mach number is unity , @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the isothermal sound speed of the ambient gas .",
    "the mac low & mccray condition of @xmath17 translates to @xmath35 . as we will find in our simulations ,",
    "the mach number of a bubble after breakout is of order @xmath36 .",
    "therefore , the mac low - mccray condition of @xmath17 translates to the condition that the mach number at breakout is of order unity . we also note that they considered superbubbles that originated at a height from the mid - plane , which made it easier for bubbles to break out .",
    "our simulations show that the critical luminosity for mach number at a distance of the scale height to be unity is @xmath37 , larger than the estimate of koo & mckee ( 1992 ) .",
    "koo & mckee ( 1992 ) then considered an additional strata of hii gas with a scale height of @xmath38 kpc and mid - plane number density @xmath39 @xmath23 , and found the breakout condition to be of order @xmath40 , or equivalently , @xmath41 erg  s@xmath3 .",
    "silich & tenorio - tagle ( 2001 ) considered the effect of halo gas pressure and determined a minimum energy for the superbubble to blow out of the galaxies ( with both disk and spherical ism distribution ) with ism gas mass in the range of @xmath42 m@xmath6 . for a disk galaxy with @xmath43 m@xmath6",
    ", they found a minimum energy of @xmath44 erg  s@xmath3 , corresponding to @xmath45 .",
    "as heckman ( 2002 ) has emphasized , it is the surface density of sfr that determines the condition for the existence of galactic winds , and not the total luminosity . to translate the above energy conditions into a surface density",
    ", we need to estimate the surface area of such bubbles at the breakout epoch . in this paper",
    ", we re - visit this issue in order to understand the empirical threshold sfr surface density for galactic winds .",
    "murray , mnard , thompson ( 2011 ) have recently argued that radiation pressure from uv radiation from a disk with a sfr surface density larger than @xmath46 m@xmath6 kpc@xmath7 yr@xmath3 can produce a large scale wind .",
    "this estimate however crucially depends on the assumption of the grain opacity , and as sharma & nath ( 2012 ) have shown the relevant opacity at uv may fall short of the requirements .",
    "there have also been studies on the existence of multiphase gas in the halos of spiral galaxies , and their connection to the star formation properties in the disk .",
    "dahlem , lisenfeld , golla ( 1995 ) considered nine edge - on galaxies with extended synchrotron emitting halo gas , and derived a minimum value of surface density of energy injection for superbubble breakout , as @xmath47 erg  s@xmath3 @xmath2 .",
    "tllmann ( 2006 ) further considered x - ray , radio and far - infrared ( fir ) emission from the extended halo gas in a sample of 23 edge - on spiral galaxies , and found that the halo contained gas at low and high temperatures ( multiphase ) if the surface density of energy injection in the disk exceeds @xmath48",
    "erg  s@xmath3 @xmath2 .",
    "if the existence of multiphase halo gas depends on the process of superbubbles breaking out of the disk and depositing hot interior gas ( as suggested by tomisaka & ikeuchi 1986 ; tenorio - tagle , rozyczka , bodenheimer 1990 ) , as well as cold gas in the shell , then it would be interesting to compare the energetics of such superbubbles and the observed threshold energy injection rate .    in this paper",
    ", we study the standard scenario of thermal pressure of the gas interior to superbubbles being the driving mechanism for the wind , and derive a threshold condition for the superwind .",
    "we find that radiative loss of energy is important for the dynamics of shocks , and the inclusion of radiation loss increases the energy budget for the bubbles to breakout of the disk and produce a wind .",
    "we also find that our estimate of the threshold energy requirement can explain the observed threshold sfr surface density for galactic outflows .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 we derive an order - of - magnitude estimate of the threshold based on the key idea that the superbubble energetics needs to balance radiative cooling",
    ". then we present the analytical formalism in  3 and discuss the results in  4 .",
    "we then present the results from numerical simulations in  5 , and discuss the effect of thermal and rt instability in  6 .",
    "to begin with , we derive a threshold rate of sne for a superbubble to continue to grow and ultimately breakout of the disk from simple arguments .",
    "we can first consider the condition that the superbubble is able to drive a strong shock in the disk .",
    "this requires the volume energy injection time scale to be shorter than the sound crossing time . in other words , if we consider a region of radius @xmath49 in the disk and an energy injection rate of @xmath15 , then one needs r / c_s , where @xmath34 is the sound speed .",
    "this gives a lower limit of @xmath50 erg  s@xmath3 @xmath2 , where @xmath51 is the ambient gas particle density in @xmath23 , and @xmath52 k.    a second , and more stringent , constraint on sne luminosity comes from accounting for radiative losses .",
    "let us assume that when a sn remnant enters the radiative stage it quickly loses its energy and does not contribute to the energy input of the superbubble .",
    "assume then that the radiative stage begins when the post - shock temperature is @xmath53 k such that the radiation loss function is maximum and much larger than the minimum at @xmath54 k. we therefore define the time when a sn remnant loses its energy at time when the shock velocity is @xmath55 km s@xmath3 ( corresponding to the post - shock temperature of @xmath56 k ) .",
    "it determines the corresponding time and radius as ( see also kahn 1998 , who defined this as the beginning of phase iii in the evolution of a bubble ) , t_a=1.4 10 ^ 5e_51 ^ 1/3n^1/3  yr ,  r_a=37e_51 ^ 1/3n^1/3  pc .",
    "one can therefore define the coherency condition as , r_a^3t_a__sn > 1 , which means that before a sn remnant stalls because of cooling losses , another sn explosion injects energy into the remnant and forms a single bubble .",
    "this condition determines the required sn rate _ _",
    "sn>3010 ^ -12(ne_51)^4/3  sne  yr^-1  pc^-3 .",
    "we can estimate the surface density of sne , by multiplying this rate density by the scale height , which is the height of a bubble at the epoch of breakout .",
    "for a scale height of @xmath57 pc , this corresponds to @xmath58 .",
    "( the scale height is relevant here because , as we will see later , the maximum radius of bubbles in the plane parallel to the disk is of order @xmath59 . ) finally , we recall that for a salpeter imf , one sn corresponds to @xmath60 m@xmath6 of stellar mass , considering stars in the range of @xmath61 m@xmath6 .",
    "therefore the threshold condition for sfr surface density becomes @xmath62 .",
    "the corresponding surface density of energy injection is @xmath63 erg  s@xmath3 @xmath2 .",
    "it is interesting to find that these above estimates of the threshold energy injection or sfr surface density are comparable to the observed threshold for the existence of multiphase halo gas ( tllmann 2006 ) and superwinds ( heckman 2002 ) .",
    "we first discuss the expansion of blastwaves in a stratified atmosphere , in the adiabatic case and then for radiative shocks .",
    "kompaneets ( 1960 ) had first analytically worked out the case of adiabatic shocks in this case ( see , e.g. , bisnovatyi - kogan & silich 1995 ) . consider an exponentially stratified medium described by @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the midplane density and @xmath66 is the scale height and @xmath67 is the explosion energy .",
    "it is assumed that the shock pressure is uniform , and is given by , @xmath68 where @xmath69 ( kompaneets 1960 ) is a constant that differentiates the shock pressure from the average pressure inside the bubble ; bisnovatyi - kogan & silich ( 1995 ) evaluated @xmath70 .",
    "we use @xmath71 for simplicity .",
    "we define a dimensionless time - like parameter as , @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the thermal energy of the interior gas , @xmath74 is the volume of the bubble and @xmath75 is the time .",
    "the shape of the shock front is derived as , @xmath76 } } \\bigr \\}\\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : komp14}\\ ] ] the location of the top and bottom of the bubble then follows by setting @xmath77 ( with @xmath78 ) , @xmath79 which shows that the top of the bubble reaches infinity when @xmath80 while @xmath75 remains finite .",
    "this implies that the bubble accelerates in the @xmath81-direction due to stratification , after an initial deceleration phase when the bubble is small and spherical , as in the usual sedov - taylor solution .",
    "the maximum cylindrical radius of the bubble is also obtained from the above solution by putting @xmath82 , @xmath83 the @xmath81-component of the velocity of the topmost point of the bubble is given by , @xmath84      we can extend kompaneets approximation and radiative blastwave calculation to the case of continuous energy injection .",
    "schiano ( 1985 ) had done a similar calculation in the case of an active galactic nucleus .",
    "consider an association with @xmath85 stars with masses above @xmath86 m@xmath6 , which ultimately produce supernovae .",
    "if we consider the main - sequence lifetime as @xmath87 yr for these stars , then the total mechanical luminosity of the sn in the association can written as , @xmath88 where supernova energy is @xmath89 erg .",
    "as mccray and kafatos ( 1987 ) have argued , since the main sequence life time scales with the stellar mass as @xmath90 , and since the initial mass function ( imf ) is given by , @xmath91 , for a salpeter imf , the rate of sn will scale with time as @xmath92 , which is roughly constant in time .",
    "here we have used @xmath93 , given the above mentioned dependence of stellar main sequence lifetime .",
    "therefore we can write , for the adiabatic case , the total energy in the superbubble as @xmath94 .",
    "= 0.5    instead of eqn [ eq : komp18 ] , the @xmath95velocity of the top of the bubble is then given by , @xmath96 and the corresponding @xmath97 parameter is also written in terms of @xmath75 , as @xmath98    these equations can determine the dynamics of the superbubble in the case of continuous energy injection .",
    "radiative losses can be important for the dynamics of both the blastwave and a superbubble with continuous energy injection .",
    "shocks become radiative when the cooling time @xmath99 .",
    "the cooling time behind the shell can be estimated as @xmath100 , for a strong shock with @xmath101 , and the shock temperature being estimated from the shock speed ( in the @xmath95direction , say ) .",
    "we assume a cooling function , as given by eqn 12 in sharma 2010 , appropriate for gas with @xmath102 k and given as follows : @xmath103 where t@xmath104 is the temperature in kev .",
    "figure [ fig : tcool ] shows the ratio @xmath105 as a function of the bubble height @xmath106 for bubbles with continuous energy injection for a few cases .",
    "the curves show that the shock enters the radiative phase much before reaching the scale height unless the ambient density and scale height are very small and @xmath85 is very large ( e.g. , the case with @xmath107 @xmath23 , @xmath21 pc , @xmath108 ) .",
    "radiation loss from the shocked medium can therefore be important ( see also maciejewski & cox 1999 ) .",
    "kovalenko & shchekinov ( 1985 ) had calculated the dynamics of a blastwave with radiative loss , assuming that the shock kinetic energy is converted into thermal energy of gas in a thin shell behind it , and that radiative loss from this shell keeps the shock isothermal .",
    "it can then be shown that for a strong shock the energy lost per unit mass is @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is the shock speed . from the hugoniot condition for a strong shock that , @xmath111 where @xmath73 is the thermal energy of the shocked gas .",
    "the structure of the shock in this case is such that the interior gas remains hot and adiabatic , whereas the shocked ambient gas that is swept into a shell loses its energy radiatively and is kept at a constant temperature ( at @xmath112 k ) .",
    "we note that mac low & mccray ( 1988 ) showed that the radiative loss from the interior hot gas of the bubble does not change the dynamics of the bubble .    following the calculation of kovalenko & shchekinov ( 1985 ) for a radiative blastwave",
    ", we assume that bubbles with continuous energy injection also form an isothermal thin shell , after a certain time @xmath113 when it enters the radiative phase . for simplicity",
    ", we also assume a self - similar solution for a spherical shock , of the type given by weaver ( 1977 ) , @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is a constant depending on the ambient density .",
    "furthermore , weaver ( 1977 ) have pointed out that a fraction @xmath116 of the total energy is stored in the shell and the rest in the rarefied gas inside . in the spirit of kovalenko & shchekinov ( 1985 )",
    "we assume the total shell energy to be thermal in nature .",
    "in other words , initially @xmath117 .",
    "we can determine the time evolution of @xmath73 as follows .    using the result derived in eqn [ eq : komp20 ] that the amount of energy lost per unit volume is @xmath118 , we can write for the evolution of thermal energy in this case , @xmath119    = 0.5    -3 mm    here @xmath120 is the radius at time @xmath113 .",
    "we can explicitly solve this equation for a spherical shock , and then use the results to estimate the @xmath95 velocity of an oval shaped bubble . for a spherical shock ( with volume @xmath121 ) , the energy equation ( no .",
    "[ eq : komp33 ] ) can be shown to yield a solution of the type @xmath122 , where @xmath123r^{\\alpha -1 } = { 6 \\over 11 } { 5 \\over3}{\\mathcal{l}^{2/3 } \\over a^{5/3 } } \\ , r^{2/3 }   % \\over { c^{5 \\over3}}}r^{2\\over3 }   \\ , .",

    "putting this value of @xmath126 in eqn [ eq : kompaneets11 ] and comparing the coefficients of time on both sides we get , @xmath127 therefore @xmath128 becomes , @xmath129 showing that roughly 70% of the total energy is radiated away .",
    "note that this is an asymptotic value of the loss in the limit @xmath130 , in the regime where the approximation @xmath131 is valid .",
    "we can therefore use equations [ eq : komp31 ] and [ eq : komp32 ] , with the above value of @xmath73 , and determine the dynamics of a radiative superbubble with continuous energy injection .",
    "figure 2 shows the evolution of the mach number for a @xmath132 k gas as a function of time , for an adiabatic blastwave , a superbubble with continuous energy injection with and without radiative loss .",
    "it is convenient to define a dynamical time scale for this problem ( mac low & mccray 1988 ) , @xmath133 , which is the expected time to reach the scale height for a self - similar evolution of superbubbles . for @xmath21pc , @xmath134 erg  s@xmath3 and @xmath135 g @xmath23 ( for @xmath136 ) , @xmath137 myr .",
    "we find that the @xmath95velocity shows a minimum at @xmath138 , when it reaches a distance of the scale height .",

    "figure [ fig : komp_res ] shows the mach number at stalling height , as a function of @xmath15 , the mechanical luminosity ( which scales as @xmath85 ) .",
    "interestingly , superbubbles with mach number ( at stalling height ) of order less than unity can be triggered by even a single sn .",
    "these , in principle , can accelerate later and therefore breakout of the disk .",
    "however , as we shall see later with our simulations , there is a minimum number of sne needed for superbubbles to breakout of the disk , particularly for high density disks .",
    "we also find from fig [ fig : komp_res ] that in order to achieve a mach number at stalling height of order @xmath140 , one needs @xmath141 erg s@xmath3 , for @xmath142 @xmath23 and @xmath143 pc . this is larger than the estimate of koo & mckee ( 1992 ) , and mac low & mccray ( 1988 ) , because of the inclusion of radiative loss from the shell .",
    "if we consider @xmath144 as the breakout condition , then we find that larger densities and scale heights put more stringent condition on the bubble to breakout .",
    "-3 mm    number density @xmath145 @xmath23 and scale heights ( @xmath146 ) pc .",
    "[ fig : komp_res ]    next we plot in figure [ fig : komp_sim_res ] the minimum mach number as a function of the surface density of @xmath85 , considering the surface area of the bubble at the stalling height .",
    "note that we are not concerned with the mean surface density of sfr in the disk galaxy here .",
    "the energy injection considered here is localized , but the relevant surface area as far as an emerging superbubble is concerned , is the area of the bubble in the plane of the disk at the point of breaking out .",
    "we find that for the surface density of energy deposition the analytic curves become independent of the scale height and depend only on the gas density and number of sne .",
    "this is because the area of a superbubble in the plane parallel to the disk , scales with @xmath147 , and is a constant for a given scale height .",

    "we first find that unlike in the analytical case , where superbubbles ultimately break out of the disk sooner or later , irrespective of the energetics , the realistic simulation runs show that for high density disk material ( @xmath215 @xmath23 ) , superbubbles keep decelerating for ever for a surface density of ob stars @xmath216 kpc@xmath7 .",
    "in other words superbubbles never break out of the disk in these cases .",
    "the corresponding energy injection surface density is @xmath217 erg @xmath2 s@xmath3 for lower density ambient gas , @xmath218 @xmath23 , however , even a single sn event can drive a bubble through the disk .",
    "we note that this limit is consistent with that found by silich & tenorio - tagle ( 2001 ) for a milky way type disk .",
    "= 0.5    -3 mm    in the case of a superbubble breaking out of the disk , there are differences in the way they evolve depending on the energy injection rate .",
    "we show the evolution of the speed of the topmost point of the bubble as a function of time for four cases in figure [ fig : vzminvst ] , for two mid - plane densities ( @xmath219 @xmath23 ) , and two scale heights ( @xmath220 pc ) , all for a surface density of ob stars of @xmath221 kpc@xmath7 .",
    "the curves show that the bubbles show acceleration after breakout of the disk only for the case of low density and small scale height ( see the curve at the top - left corner , for @xmath107 @xmath23 , @xmath222 pc ) .",
    "in other cases , for disk column density @xmath223 @xmath2 , the bubbles either coast along with the the speed that they reach at the breakout , or decelerate to some extent , for a considerable period of time before they start accelerating after reaching a distance of several scale heights .",
    "the curves show that the speed at the stalling height , or the minimum speed of the bubbles , is an important characteristics of the bubble dynamics .",
    "it is important because this is the characteristic speed with which the bubble sweeps most of the extra - planar region of the halo .",
    "also , since the bubble begins to accelerate only after reaching a distance of a few times the scale height , the corresponding rayleigh - taylor instability should not set in at the scale height , but at a much larger distance .",
    "we shall re - visit this point in the next section on instabilities . in some cases ,",
    "the curves show a deceleration at late times .",
    "this is due to the formation of clumps in the shell from radiative cooling , which often sink through the hot gas owing to gravity .",
    "we have found that typically the minimum speed @xmath224 , where @xmath225 is the dynamical time defined earlier .",
    "these values are shown as horizontal lines in figure [ fig : vzminvst ] for respective cases .",
    "it is easy to see that in case of little radiation loss , the speed of the bubble at the time of reaching the scale height is @xmath226 , as expected from the self - similar evolution of a bubble ( @xmath227 ) .",
    "our simulations show that the actual speed is roughly a third of this value , and therefore shows the importance of radiative loss in the dynamics of superbubbles . as analytically derived earlier , radiation losses remove as much as 70% of the total energy of the superbubbles .",
    "we recall that for an ambient medium with a given temperature , the dimensionless quantity defined by mac low & norman ( 1988 ) is @xmath228 , so that their condition of @xmath229 for break out corresponds to a minimum mach number of order unity .",
    "-3 mm    we show the resulting value of minimum mach number of superbubbles for different @xmath230 and @xmath14 in figure [ fig : real_sim1 ] , as a function of surface density of energy injection .",
    "the curves show that in terms of energy injection or sne surface density , the crucial parameter is the mid - plane gas density , which separates the curves , as was also indicated by our analytical results .",
    "superbubbles with a given surface density of energy injection find it easier to break out of disks with lower mid - plane density .",
    "however , scale height also makes a small difference unlike in the analytical calculations ; a higher energy density is required to clear a thicker disk .",
    "the important features of our results as shown in figure [ fig : real_sim1 ] are :    * as mentioned above , the condition for a break out from a dense ambient medium with gas density of @xmath142 @xmath23 is an energy injection rate surface density of @xmath231 erg @xmath2 s@xmath3 . for lower gas densities ,",
    "the required rate density is @xmath232 erg @xmath2 s@xmath3 .",
    "the corresponding mach number for these superbubbles that can be as low as of order unity .",
    "* superbubbles that can break out with a larger mach number of @xmath233 corresponds to @xmath234 @xmath85 kpc@xmath7 , or an energy injection surface density of @xmath1 erg  s@xmath3 @xmath2 , for the most realistic spiral disks , with @xmath107 @xmath23 , @xmath143 pc , or @xmath142 @xmath23 , @xmath222 pc ( which for milky way case describes either the warm extra - planar or cold gas ) .",
    "we note that the largest ob associations have @xmath112 m@xmath6 ( mckee & williams 1997 ) , and with a cross - sectional area of order @xmath235 ( since @xmath236 asymptotically ; see equation [ eq : rmax ] ) , a superbubble blown by such a large ob association can only have @xmath237 sne kpc@xmath7 , for a salpeter imf .",
    "therefore we can conclude that ( a ) only the largest of the ob associations can produce a bubble that can break out of milky way - type disks , ( b ) this also corresponds to the minimum energy injection rate of @xmath1 erg  s@xmath3 @xmath2 as observed by dahlem ( 1995 ) for the existence of radio emitting halo gas , and ( c ) larger ism density or scale height would require more than one ob association to produce a superbubble or adjacent multiple bubbles that can coalesce and grow together .",
    "recent simulations show that cosmic rays can stream through ism gas to considerable heights above the disk , and break out of superbubbles can provide such channels ( uhlig ( 2012 ) . *",
    "as explained earlier , the minimum speed of @xmath238 km s@xmath3 , for an ambient gas at @xmath132 k , also corresponds to the case where the hot ( and multiphase gas ; see next section on instabilities and gas cooling ) interior gas can sweep up to a height of @xmath239 kpc within a time period of @xmath210 myr , the time scale over which ob stars explode and keep injecting energy in the bubble .",
    "combined with the result mentioned above , we can conclude that an energy injection rate of @xmath1 erg  s@xmath3 @xmath2 , or @xmath234",
    "@xmath85 kpc@xmath7 can not only produce a bubble that can break out of the disk but also fill the halo up to a height of order @xmath239 kpc . *",
    "if we insist on a larger mach number at stalling height , to be @xmath240 , then the energy injection rate becomes @xmath48 erg  s@xmath3 @xmath2 , with @xmath241 @xmath85 kpc@xmath7 .",
    "using a time scale of @xmath210 myr of ob stars , the corresponding sfr surface density for a salpeter imf is @xmath242 m@xmath6 yr@xmath3 kpc@xmath7 .",
    "if superbubbles seed galactic outflows , then the gas speed is required to be a few hundred km s@xmath3 , and the mach number at stalling height is needed to be much larger than ten , and the corresponding requirement on sfr surface density increasing to @xmath5 m@xmath6 yr@xmath3 kpc@xmath7 , the observed threshold .",
    "therefore , the heckman ( 2000 ) threshold ( @xmath5 m@xmath6 yr@xmath3 kpc@xmath7 ) for superwinds corresponds to a larger requirement on the part of superbubbles , of not only breaking out of disks but doing so with a large mach number .",
    "the focus till now was on the important @xmath243 parameter ( the minimum mach number of the shell ) which determines the fate of the superbubble after it crosses the scale height . in this section",
    "we discuss the role of different instabilities , in particular rayleigh - taylor and thermal instabilities , in our 2-d breakout simulations .",
    "when the superbubble reaches about a scale height , the shock is generally believed to accelerate owing to the decrease in pressure .",
    "this should lead to the onset of the rayleigh - taylor ( rt ) instability , as has been invoked in previous analytical works ( e.g. , koo & mckee 1992 ) and seen in numerical simulations ( e.g. , mac low , mccray & norman 1989 ) .",
    "however , as mentioned earlier , our simulations show that superbubbles _ do not _ accelerate until after they reach a distance of several scale heights ( as was also suggested by ferrara & tolstoy 2000 who assumed spherical bubbles ) .",
    "therefore rt instability occurs at a distance _ much larger _ than the scale height .",
    "also we find that before the onset of rt instability , the superbubble expanding in the disk suffers from thermal instability in the early stages of its evolution .",
    "this instability leads to clumping and fragmentation of the shell of the superbubble well in advance of the rt instability , and can therefore affect the outcome of the rt instability .",
    "= 0.5    -3 mm    figure [ fig : sim_temp ] shows the 2-d snapshots of temperature at two different times for our fiducial high resolution run ( @xmath108 , @xmath142 @xmath23 , @xmath143 pc ) .",
    "figure [ fig : real_sim1 ] indicates that the minimum mach number for this case is @xmath244 and the bubble is just about able to break out within the starburst timescale .",
    "the temperature snapshot at early time ( 9 myr ) , when the bubble has just reached the scale - height , shows that the bubble is roughly spherical .",
    "the radiative shell seems to develop corrugations where the hot bubble gas and the radiatively cooled shocked gas interpenetrate .",
    "the shell is at @xmath245 k ( the same as the ambient ism temperature ) , the temperature below which the cooling function drops suddenly and the gas becomes thermally stable .",
    "the dense shell is more clearly seen in the density snapshots of figure [ fig : sim_den ] .",
    "the corrugations are definitely driven by radiative cooling because the run without radiative cooling shows a smooth shell ( the third panel in figs .",
    "[ fig : sim_temp ] and [ fig : sim_den ] ) .    while the fragments of cold shell are confined to the bubble boundary at early times , the cold gas lags behind the hot gas at later times because the hot gas is pushed out by supernova heating .",
    "the cold blobs are only pushed out because of the drag force due to the hot gas but eventually trail behind .",
    "the cold blobs embedded in the hot gas are reminiscent of the cold multiphase filaments observed in galactic outflows , such as m82 .",
    "since in our simulations cold gas leaves the simulation box from the inner boundary , all the cold blobs embedded in the hot bubble come from the fragmenting cold shell . in reality",
    ", some cold gas from the cold star - forming regions can also be uplifted by the hot gas . at late times , in the runs with cooling , there are some signs of bubble breaking out because of rt instability close to the polar regions .",
    "all such signatures of rt instability are missing in the run without cooling ( panel 3 ) .",
    "this is mainly because rt instability in the run with cooling is seeded with large amplitude perturbations by corrugations caused by shell cooling .",
    "= 0.5    -3 mm    = 0.55    -3 mm    in order to assess the relative importance of thermal and rt instabilities , we compare the two times scales in figure [ fig : tff - tcool ] .",
    "we note that the time scale for rt instability ( @xmath246 ) is comparable to the free - fall time ( @xmath247 , for the largest mode with @xmath248 , where @xmath81 and @xmath249 are the height and acceleration of the shell , and @xmath250 is the acceleration due to gravity .",
    "we plot this time scale with a solid line in figure [ fig : tff - tcool ] , along with the cooling time ( @xmath251 ) of the shell as a function of time for runs corresponding to figures [ fig : sim_temp ] & [ fig : sim_den ] .",
    "we use the position of the outermost densest part to identify the shell position . in the left panel of figure [ fig : tff - tcool ]",
    ", we show the case of @xmath108 , @xmath142 @xmath23 , @xmath143 pc .",
    "we expect the shell to cool radiatively if @xmath252 is shorter than time .",
    "and indeed , the radiative cooling time is shorter than time at early times .",
    "this is consistent with the cooling and fragmentation of the dense shell seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : sim_temp ] & [ fig : sim_den ] . one point of caution : we should ideally plot the cooling time of the shell assuming the shell temperature and density corresponding to an adiabatic shock because cooling will happen if this timescale is short . here",
    "we are plotting the cooling time of the shell , which for the left panel case , has already cooled to low temperatures . since cooling time increases sharply below @xmath132 k",
    ", @xmath252 is barely smaller than time in the left panel of figure [ fig : tff - tcool ] . at later times",
    "@xmath252 becomes longer than time and we do not expect the newly accumulated shell material to cool .",
    "the rt timescale ( @xmath253 ) is always longer than time for the fiducial run .",
    "the free - fall time increases initially as the shock slows down until a scale height .",
    "after that the shock moves at a small mach number @xmath254 .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that we do not see vigorous rt instability in figures [ fig : sim_temp ] & [ fig : sim_den ] .",
    "the middle panel of the figure [ fig : tff - tcool ] shows various timescales for a midplane density of @xmath107 @xmath23 .",
    "the cooling time for this case is shorter than the cooling time for the higher density case .",
    "this seems inconceivable given the higher density and efficient cooling for the run in the left panel .",
    "this discrepancy arises because although the density for the @xmath107 @xmath23 is smaller , the temperature of the post - shock gas is @xmath255 k , where the cooling function peaks . consequently the cooling time is shorter than the higher density run . for comparison ,",
    "we have also plotted the cooling and free - fall timescales for the runs without cooling in the right panel . the density and temperature snapshots for this run do not show cooling - induced fragmentation .",
    "we have shown in figure [ fig : real_sim1 ] by darkened points the cases in which @xmath252 is always less than @xmath256 , for different values of @xmath257 , @xmath14 and @xmath230 .",
    "we find that these cases mostly appear for which , roughly , @xmath258 , except for the case of @xmath143 pc and @xmath142 @xmath23 , for which there is a cross - over point in time after @xmath259 .",
    "we note that this range of @xmath139 corresponds to a case in which the shell temperature ( @xmath260 ) remains in the range of @xmath261 , where the cooling function peaks .",
    "this implies a range in @xmath85 for which thermal instability is imporant . in the low @xmath85 limit , the shock is not strong enough and @xmath262 k , and in the high @xmath85 case , the shock is very strong ( @xmath263 k ) and @xmath256 ( rt timescale ) is shorter than @xmath252 at late times .",
    "we are therefore led to conclude that superbubbles are affected not only by rt instability but also by thermal instability , depending on the density and energy injection .",
    "this implies that the fragmentation of the bubble shell that releases the hot interior gas into the halo occurs under the combined effects of thermal instability at early times and rt instability at late times if the mach number at stalling epoch is large enough .",
    "superbubbles with fragmented shells are believed to ultimately form ` chimneys ' ( norman & ikeuchi ( 1989 ) , which connect the halo gas to the processes in the disk in different ways . apart from transporting hot gas to the halo , chimneys provide a natural channel for lyman continuum photons from hot stars in the disk to reach the diffuse ionized medium of the reynolds layer ( reynolds 1991 ; dove & shull 1994 ) .",
    "it is however important for the superbubble shells to fragment before the main sequence life times of o stars for a substantial fraction of ionizing radiation to escape the disk ( dove , shull , ferrara 2000 ) .",
    "this implies a fragmentation time scale of @xmath264 myr , which is comparable to the dynamical timescale ( @xmath265 ) , for superbubbles with @xmath266 erg ( corresponding to @xmath267 ) , typical disk parameters .",
    "this is the energy scale for the largest of the ob associations , and as our results show superbubbles with smaller energetics find it hard to pierce through the disk , unless the ob association is located much above the mid - plane level .    in other words , for superbubbles to act as effective conduits of ionizing radiation for the halo , or for the intergalactic medium ( at high redshift , in the context of the epoch of reionization ) , the superbubbles need to fragment roughly around the time when they reach a scale height .",
    "this is unlikely to happen only through rt instability as superbubbles do not accelerate until reaching a distance of several scale heights .",
    "also , as de avillez & breitschwerdt ( 2005 ) have discussed on the basis of simulations of a magnetized ism , superbubble shells can stabilize against rt instability in the presence of magnetic fields . in this regard ,",
    "the clumping of the shell from thermal instability at an early phase of evolution of the superbubble can be important .      *",
    "our analytic calculations show that radiation losses are important for superbubble dynamics .",
    "radiation loss is more important for superbubbles with continuous energy injection than a supernova remnant of similar total energy .",
    "we estimate almost 70% of the total energy being radiated away .",
    "we have further checked our analytical results with numerical simluations .",
    "we found that analytic results match the simulations well , differing at most by a factor of order unity for the case of large ambient density .",
    "the results obtained by the analytical means therefore provide a useful benchmark to compare with realistic simualtions .",
    "also , for disks with large gas density , with @xmath215 @xmath23 , superbubble breakouts are not possible for surface density of ob stars @xmath268 kpc@xmath7 , or an equivalent energy injection surface density of @xmath269 erg @xmath2 s@xmath3 .",
    "* superbubbles that emerge from the disk with mach number of order @xmath0 require an energy injection rate of @xmath47 erg @xmath2 s@xmath3 , corresponding to explosions triggered by the largest ob associations with @xmath132 m@xmath6 .",
    "this energy injection scale corresponds to disk galaxies with synchrotron emitting gas in the extra - planar regions .",
    "* vigorous superbubbles that break out of the disk with sufficiently large mach number ( @xmath270 ) , correspond to an energy injection rate of @xmath48 erg @xmath2 s@xmath3 , or equivalently , a sfr surface density of @xmath5 m@xmath6 yr@xmath3 kpc@xmath7 .",
    "these superbubbles require more than one ob associations to produce and sustain their dynamics , and this energy injection scale corresponds to ( a ) the existence of multiphase gas in the halo of disk galaxies , and ( b ) the heckman threshold for the onset of superwinds .",
    "* superbubbles do not accelerate until reaching a vertical distance of a few scale heights ( of order @xmath254 ) , which implies that rt instability helps to fragment the shells not at a distance of a scale height but at a much larger height .",
    "also , we find that for typical disk parameters , thermal instability acts on the shell at the early stages of superbubble evolution , and forms clumps and fragments in the shell , much before the shell is acted upon by rt instability .",
    "radiative cooling therefore manifests in seeding thermal instability , which has important implications for the clumping of superbubble shell and producing channels of leakage for ultraviolet radiation into the halo .",
