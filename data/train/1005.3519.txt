    "gauge - gravity duality is a powerful method to study strongly - coupled gauge dynamics .",
    "it relates a weakly - coupled theory of gravity to a lower dimensional large-@xmath5 gauge theory at strong coupling @xcite .",
    "the best - understood example is the ads@xmath6/cft@xmath7-correspondence between @xmath8@xmath1@xmath2 supersymmetric yang - mills ( sym ) theory on @xmath9 and weakly coupled type - iib supergravity on ads@xmath10 , where all available evidence suggests that the correspondence is exact , at least to leading order in @xmath11 .",
    "another method to study gauge dynamics in lattice and continuum formulations is the large-@xmath5 volume independence @xcite .",
    "while much less appreciated than the ads / cft correspondence , large-@xmath5 volume independence is one of the few exact results in gauge theories .",
    "the statement of the volume independence theorem is that large-@xmath5 non - abelian quantum gauge theories toroidally compactified on four - manifolds , @xmath12@xmath1@xmath13 , have properties that are independent of the @xmath14 compactification radii .",
    "more precisely , expectation values and connected correlators of single - trace operators are the same in the reduced and infinite - volume theories , to leading order in @xmath11if the operators are neutral under the @xmath15 center symmetry and carry momenta in the compact directions quantized in units of the inverse compactification radii . volume independence holds provided two basic quantum mechanical conditions are satisfied : _",
    "i. ) _  translation symmetry is not spontaneously broken and _ ii . ) _  @xmath15 center - symmetry is not spontaneously broken .    in lattice - regularized gauge theories , where the lattice is reduced to a single site",
    ", this equivalence is known as `` large-@xmath5 reduction '' or ",
    "eguchi - kawai ( ek)-reduction \" @xcite .",
    "the necessary and sufficient conditions for the validity of volume independence have been known since the early 80 s .",
    "however , the first examples of gauge theories which satisfy them to arbitrarily small volumes were found only recently @xcite .",
    "because of this , there has been a recent resurgence of interest in this subject , particularly in the lattice community  not only because small volume large-@xmath5 simulations are more cost effective , but also for other reasons , such as lattice supersymmetry .",
    "furthermore , any gauge theory which satisfies volume independence admits a complementary volume - dependent domain , obtained by first fixing @xmath5 and taking the radii small , where subtle non - perturbative aspects , such as the existence of a mass gap , can be analyzed by semi - classical methods , see e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the existence of a semi - classical domain is the main advantage of studying the compactified theory , instead of the theory on @xmath9 . for some center - symmetric theories",
    ", there is evidence suggesting that the small radius domain is the analytic continuation of the large or infinite radius @xcite ( also see @xcite ) , and the size of the circle times @xmath5 may be used as an analytic expansion parameter .",
    "volume independence holds for arbitrary values of the coupling , including the strong - coupling limit of the gauge - gravity correspondence .",
    "it is thus interesting to examine the consistency of the two correspondences ; at the very least , this provides a consistency check on their exactness . in this paper",
    ", we exhibit the simplest set - up where volume independence and ads / cft should hold simultaneously ( see the concluding section for comments on related earlier work @xcite ) .",
    "we consider the gravity dual of strongly - coupled @xmath8@xmath1@xmath2 sym compactified on @xmath16 and study how volume independence arises .",
    "we show that in the center - symmetric vacuum @xmath4-branes  geometrize \" volume independence , ensuring that the expectation value of , e.g. , a wilson loop in the uncompactified ( @xmath17 ) directions is independent of the @xmath18 compactification radius , for arbitrary interquark separation and in accordance with the volume independence theorem .",
    "the type - iib background dual to @xmath8@xmath1@xmath2 sym compactified on @xmath16 of radius @xmath19 is : @xmath20 this is compactified @xmath21@xmath22@xmath23 of radius @xmath24@xmath25@xmath26 , in local poincare coordinates , expressed in terms of the energy variable @xmath27 .",
    "we use string units @xmath28@xmath1@xmath29 and denote the t hooft coupling of the dual sym theory by @xmath30@xmath31@xmath32 .",
    "compactification of a worldvolume direction of ads@xmath6 leads to a conical singularity : as seen from ( [ d3 - 1 ] ) , the proper radius of @xmath18 , equal to @xmath33 , becomes of order the string scale at @xmath34 .",
    "the masses of kaluza - klein excitations and string winding modes become comparable , invalidating the supergravity approximation .",
    "thus , for energy scales @xmath35 the non - singular gravity description is given by the t - dual ( along the @xmath36 direction ) type - iia background of @xmath5 @xmath37 branes located on a dual circle of size @xmath38 .",
    "the positions of the @xmath37 branes on the dual circle correspond to the eigenvalues of the wilson loop @xmath39 $ ] of the gauge field around the compact direction .",
    "thus , a vacuum where all @xmath5 @xmath37 branes are located at the same point on the dual circle breaks the center symmetry , as @xmath40 .",
    "the type - iia gravity background corresponding to the center - broken vacuum is easy to determine by the method of images and knowledge of the background of @xmath5 @xmath37-branes in @xmath41 : @xmath42 here @xmath43 is a harmonic function in the seven dimensions transverse to the stack of @xmath37 branes and @xmath44 is the type - iia string coupling . instead of presenting detailed formulae ( given in , e.g. , @xcite ) , for our purposes",
    "it suffices to only picture the brane arrangement .",
    "taking @xmath45 as the compact direction , the metric of the center - broken bps - brane configuration is determined by a harmonic function equal to the sum of the harmonic functions due to each stack of @xmath5 @xmath37 branes separated a distance @xmath38 along @xmath45 , as shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : equipotential]a .",
    "each stack of branes creates an @xmath46  potential , \" where @xmath47 and @xmath48 @xmath49 denotes the radial direction transverse to both the @xmath37 branes and the compact direction .",
    "it is clear from the picture ( and intuition from electrostatics ) that when @xmath50 , the @xmath45-translational invariance of the background is recovered and that at @xmath51 the harmonic function becomes @xmath52 , identical to that of the corresponding stack of @xmath53 branes ( recall that the type iia coupling is @xmath54 ) .",
    "thus the type iia metric in the center - broken vacuum reads , for @xmath55 : @xmath56 up to exponentially small corrections .",
    "the metric ( [ d2 - 2 ] ) is the t - dual metric of ( [ d3 - 1 ] ) ( in the sense of @xcite ) as evidenced by the fact that only the @xmath57 terms are different ( we do not show the relation between the type - iia and type - iib dilatons , which is trivial to obtain ) .",
    "it is also clear that in the center - broken vacuum the type - iia metric will differ from ( [ d2 - 2 ] ) once @xmath58 becomes of order unity or smaller .",
    "we conclude that in the center - broken vacuum , the backgrounds ( [ d2 - 2 ] ) and ( [ d3 - 1 ] ) are equivalent for @xmath55 , where the @xmath45 isometry is restored .",
    "thus , for example , a calculation of the expectation value of a wilson loop of size @xmath59 , positioned in the @xmath60@xmath61@xmath62 plane of the noncompact @xmath17 can be made via ( [ d2 - 2 ] ) so long as @xmath63so that the string worldsheet only probes the bulk geometry in the @xmath55 region , close to the  uv - brane \" ( recall the ",
    "energy - distance \" relation , @xmath64@xmath25@xmath29 , for the minimum value @xmath65 of @xmath66 probed by a wilson loop of size @xmath67 @xcite ) .",
    "thus , wilson loops of interquark separation @xmath63 are unaffected by the compactification , as one would naively expect .",
    "however , the worldsheet relevant for wilson loops with @xmath68 probes the bulk geometry further away from the uv , as now @xmath69 , a region , where ( [ d2 - 2 ] ) receives corrections due to the compactification .     of radius @xmath38.,width=336 ]    hence , in the center - symmetry breaking vacuum , the wilson loop ( and other correlators ) exhibit volume dependence . this is consistent with expectations from compactified field theory that the wilson loop with inter - quark separation @xmath68 should be sensitive to the @xmath16 compactification .",
    "in fact , a dual gravity analysis @xcite of the wilson loop in the compactified @xmath70 sym theory shows that the behavior of the quark - antiquark potential changes from @xmath71 , at short distances @xmath63 , to @xmath72 in an intermediate @xmath37-brane region , and back to @xmath71 in the far - infrared @xmath73-brane region ( the latter describes the three dimensional 16 supercharge cft that @xmath74 sym flows to upon a center - symmetry breaking compactification @xcite ) .",
    "consider now the center - symmetric vacuum of the @xmath75 sym theory on @xmath16 . according to ek reduction , appropriate observables should now exhibit @xmath18-size independence .    in the type - iia picture",
    ", a center - symmetric vacuum corresponds to a configuration of @xmath5 @xmath37 branes distributed equidistantly on the dual circle  since their positions on the dual @xmath18 correspond to the eigenvalues of @xmath76 , now clearly @xmath77 , for all @xmath78 .",
    "the metric dual to the center - symmetric @xmath37-brane configuration can similarly be computed using the method of images .",
    "the difference is that now single @xmath37-branes are spaced a distance @xmath79 apart along the compact @xmath45 direction , as shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : equipotential]b .",
    "the harmonic function determining the background is , again , the sum of the @xmath80  potentials \" of the individual @xmath37-branes ( with @xmath47 , as before ) , resulting in the @xmath37-brane harmonic function which determines the metric , as in ( [ d2 - 1 ] ) : @xmath81^{5 \\over 2 } } . ~",
    "\\label{h2sym }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by poisson resummation , ( [ h2sym ] ) takes the form : @xmath82,~   \\label{h2sym2 }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath83 is the modified bessel function .",
    "the crucial difference with respect to the center - broken vacuum discussed in @xcite is the appearance of a factor of @xmath5 in the correction term in ( [ h2sym2 ] ) .",
    "hence , the @xmath45-isometry is now recovered for much smaller values of @xmath48 ( @xmath84 , the energy scale ) .",
    "it is clear ( from ( [ h2sym2 ] ) or from electrostatics ) that now the condition for isometry restoration is @xmath85 , instead of @xmath55 in the center - broken vacuum .",
    "thus the background dual to the center - symmetric vacuum is also given by ( [ d2 - 2 ] ) , but is now valid for @xmath86 .",
    "we note that while near each individual @xmath37-brane the supergravity approximation is not to be trusted ( because large curvatures occur and physics is described by an ir free abelian theory ) , no large curvatures appear in the background ( [ d2 - 2 ] ) , ( [ h2sym2 ] ) at @xmath87 , i.e. , at any finite distance away from the d2-branes ( similar backgrounds are also considered in @xcite ) .",
    "the fact that the center - symmetric vacuum is described by ( [ d2 - 2 ] ) for any @xmath87 immediately implies that a wilson loop of any size ( strictly speaking of size @xmath88 ) will be insensitive to the compactification .",
    "thus , the potential between two static quarks exhibits the behavior characteristic of the four dimensional @xmath75 cft , @xmath89 , at all scales , despite the fact that one dimension is compactified and conformal symmetry of the background is explicitly broken .    in the language of non - perturbative orbifold equivalences @xcite",
    ", the neutral sector observables in the compactified  daughter \" theory enjoy the conformal symmetry of its  parent \" theory on @xmath9 , at leading order in @xmath5 .",
    "however , it should also be noted that the daughter theory also possesses a non - neutral sector aware of the compactification radius .",
    "the main point is that for neutral - sector observables , the space may be viewed as having an effective size @xmath90 and thus @xmath91 is a decompactification limit .",
    "it is clear that other quantities will also exhibit volume independence  for example , correlation functions of single - trace operators that only carry momentum in the noncompact directions will also be insensitive to the compactification , as required by ek reduction .",
    "ek reduction also requires that expectation values of wilson loops extending also in @xmath18 , but not winding around the compact direction ( i.e. , center - symmetry neutral ones ) , exhibit volume independence ; however , explicitly verifying their volume independence in the gravity dual appears more challenging to us than for the observables we consider .",
    "-branes.,width=336 ]    finally , we briefly note a slight refinement of the condition for volume independence inferred from the gravity dual . in our discussion above , we did not consider the behavior of the type - iia dilaton .",
    "in fact , examining its behavior shows that the effective string coupling becomes large when @xmath92thus , the region of validity of volume independence that can be inferred from the type - iia dual of the center - symmetric vacuum would be @xmath93 , instead of simply @xmath85 .",
    "however , the type - iia description can be uplifted to eleven dimensional supergravity ( m - theory ) @xcite .",
    "the size of the eleventh direction , parameterized by @xmath94 , is related to the type - ii couplings as @xmath95 and the center - symmetric @xmath37 brane configuration is replaced by a similar configuration of @xmath73-branes located a distance @xmath79 apart along @xmath45 , as shown on fig .",
    "for @xmath96 the @xmath73-brane background can be written in a form : @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the type - iia metric ( [ d2 - 2 ] ) and @xmath99 is the type - iia dilaton .",
    "as this background is dual to ( [ d2 - 2 ] ) , it follows that the regime of volume independence is @xmath100 , improving on the type - iia bound @xmath93 .",
    "a bound on the validity of volume independence of the form @xmath101@xmath102@xmath103 can also be inferred from field theory considerations and is consistent with the strong - coupling bound from supergravity obtained here ( see @xcite for a field - theory analysis of @xmath104@xmath1@xmath2 sym in the volume - independence context ) . at asymptotically low energies @xmath105 ,",
    "eleven dimensional supergravity breaks down for center - symmetric m2-branes , consistent with the free abelian long - distance dynamics , unlike the coincident m2-branes case where the ir - physics is non - abelian and superconformal .",
    "we considered the simplest case where ek reduction of a four - dimensional gauge theory is valid simultaneously with gauge - gravity duality .",
    "our considerations indicate that @xmath70 sym compactified on @xmath16 indeed exhibits volume independence in the center - symmetry preserving vacuum .",
    "the gravity dual of four dimensional @xmath70 sym gives the first explicitly solvable realization of volume independence above two dimensions ( where ek reduction is manifest in the large-@xmath5 limit of the exactly solvable pure ym lattice theory @xcite ) .",
    "our findings can also be viewed as providing a check on the weakest form of the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "it would be interesting to consider how ek reduction works when more than one dimension is compactified , especially with regard of how center - symmetry preservation is reflected in the brane and gravity set - ups .",
    "the @xmath16 case is special in this respect , as one is free to choose a classical center - symmetric vacuum state , not washed away by quantum fluctuations which become strong as more dimensions are compactified .",
    "we note that ref .",
    "@xcite previously considered large-@xmath5 reductions in the holographic picture with all dimensions compactified , but the matching of observables and the question of fluctuations raised above were not studied",
    ".    it may also be interesting to study volume independence for confining gauge theories with known gravity duals , as well as by exploiting the analogy between the @xmath11 and genus expansion in gauge and string theories .",
    "for example , @xcite showed that free energy of ym theory receives contributions only from riemann surfaces of genus @xmath106 in the confined phase @xmath107 $ ] , but it receives a contribution from genus zero in the deconfined phase @xmath108 $ ] .",
    "this is nothing but the temperature independence of confined phase and temperature dependence of the deconfined phase , to leading order in @xmath5 . in this context , for example , the double - trace deformation stabilizing the theory to the confined phase @xcite may have a stringy interpretation in terms of analytic continuation of the winding - number unbroken phase of @xcite to small radii .",
