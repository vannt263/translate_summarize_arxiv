    "the ability to monitor the gamma - ray sky continuously is extremely important .",
    "the majority of gamma - ray sources are variable , exhibiting flares and transient outbursts on time scales from seconds to years . while there are currently several all - sky monitors in the hard x - ray energy range providing daily light curves , e.g. the all - sky monitor ( asm ) on the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) from 210 kev @xcite , the gas slit camera ( gsc ) on the _ monitor of all - sky x - ray image _ ( _ maxi _ ) from 1.520 kev @xcite , and the burst alert telescope ( bat ) on _ swift",
    "_ from 1550 kev @xcite , there has not been an all - sky monitor in the low energy gamma - ray region since the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) instrument on the _ compton gamma - ray observatory _ ( _ cgro _ ) , which was sensitive from 201800 kev @xcite .",
    "the gamma - ray satellite _ fermi _ was launched on 2008 june 11 and commenced science operations on 2008 august 12 . _ fermi _ contains two instruments : the large area telescope ( lat ) , sensitive to gamma rays from @xmath4 mev to @xmath5 gev @xcite ; and the gamma - ray burst monitor ( gbm ) , which is sensitive to x - rays and gamma rays from 8 kev to 40 mev @xcite . with its wide field of view , gbm can be used to provide nearly continuous full - sky coverage in the hard x - ray / soft gamma - ray energy range .",
    "it is the only instrument currently in orbit that can perform all - sky monitoring above 100 kev ( but below the 30 mev threshold of the _ fermi _ lat ) with useable sensitivity .",
    "the _ swift _ /bat sensitivity drops off rapidly above 100 kev , and its energy range effectively ends at 195 kev . _ integral _ , which has a relatively narrow field of view , can not make continuous observations of a large number of individual sources . also , gbm is not limited by solar pointing constraints , as are most other instruments , which allows the monitoring of sources at times during which other instruments can not .    the earth occultation technique , used very successfully with batse , has been adapted to gbm to obtain fluxes for an input catalog of known or potential sources . a catalog of 82 sources is currently being monitored and regularly updated .",
    "this catalog contains predominantly galactic x - ray binaries , but also includes the crab , the sun , two magnetars , five active galactic nulcei ( agn ) , and two cataclysmic variables . at energies above 100 kev , six persistent sources ( the crab , cyg x-1 , swift j1753.5 - 0127 , 1e 1740 - 29 , cen a",
    ", grs 1915 + 105 ) and two transient sources ( gx 339 - 4 and xte j1752 - 223 ) have been detected in the first two years of observations . in section  [ sec : obs ] , we briefly describe the gbm instrument and outline the earth occultation technique as applied to gbm , in section  [ sec : res ] we present the light curves for the eight sources , and in section  [ sec : dis ] we discuss the results , the gbm capabilities and future work .",
    "gbm consists of 14 detectors : 12 nai detectors , each 12.7 cm in diameter and 1.27 cm thick ; and two bgo detectors , 12.7 cm in diameter and 12.7 cm thick .",
    "the nai detectors are located on the corners of the spacecraft , with six detectors oriented such that the normals to their faces are perpendicular to the z - axis of the spacecraft ( the lat is pointed in the @xmath6-direction ) , four detectors pointed at @xmath7 from the z - axis , and 2 detectors pointed @xmath8 off the z - axis .",
    "together , these 12 detectors provide nearly uniform coverage of the unocculted sky in the energy range from 8 kev to 1 mev .",
    "the two bgo detectors are located on opposite sides of the spacecraft and view a large part of the sky in the energy range @xmath9 kev to @xmath10 mev .",
    "it should be noted that none of the gbm detectors have direct imaging capability .",
    "single crab occultation step seen in the ctime raw counts data of a single gbm nai detector ( nai 2 ) in the 1225 kev band with 2.048-second time bins .",
    "the crab was @xmath11 from the normal to the detector .",
    "the time window is centered on the calculated occultation time for 100 kev.,width=291 ]    known sources of gamma - ray emission can be monitored with non - imaging detectors using the earth occultation technique , as was successfully demonstrated with batse @xcite .",
    "when a source of gamma rays is occulted by the earth , the count rate measured by a detector will drop , producing a step - like feature .",
    "when the source reappears from behind the earth s limb , the count rate will increase , producing another step .",
    "the occultation has a finite transition time due to the effect of absorption in the earth s atmosphere .",
    "the shapes of the individual occultation steps depend on energy and occultation angle .",
    "the occultation angle , @xmath12 , is defined as the elevation angle of the source being occulted with respect to the plane of the _ fermi _ orbit .",
    "the transmission through the atmosphere as a function of time is modeled as @xmath13 $ ] , where @xmath14 is the mass attenuation coefficient of gamma rays at energy @xmath15 in air and @xmath16 is the air mass along the line of sight at a given altitude @xmath17 based on the @xcite .",
    "this requires instantaneous knowledge of the spacecraft position , the direction to the source of interest as seen from the spacecraft , and a model of the earth that includes its oblateness . _",
    "fermi _ was launched into a @xmath18 inclination orbit at an altitude of 555 km .",
    "the orbital period is 96 minutes , and individual occultation steps last for @xmath19 seconds .",
    "figure  [ crabstep ] shows a single step due to a crab occultation in the count rate in the 1225 kev band of a single gbm nai detector observing the occultation nearly face - on .",
    "the diameter of the earth as seen from _ fermi _ is @xmath20 , so roughly 30% of the sky is occulted by the earth at any one time .",
    "one complete orbit of the spacecraft allows over 85% of the sky to be observed .",
    "the precession of the orbital plane allows the entire sky to be occulted every @xmath0 days ( half the precession period for the _ fermi _ orbit ) , though the exposure is not uniform .",
    "the earth occultation technique was developed for batse using two separate approaches , one at the nasa marshall space flight center @xcite and the other at the nasa jet propulsion laboratory @xcite . for gbm , we follow the @xcite approach .",
    "the primary difference in the implementation of the occultation technique between gbm and batse arises from the different pointing schemes of the respective missions .",
    "_ cgro _ was three - axis stabilized for each viewing period , which typically lasted for two weeks .",
    "this meant that a source remained at a fixed orientation with respect to the detectors through an entire viewing period .",
    "in contrast , _ fermi _ scans the sky by pointing in a direction @xmath21 ( august 2008september 2009 ) or @xmath22 ( october 2009present ) north of the zenith for one orbit ; it then rocks to @xmath21 or @xmath22 south for the next orbit , continuing to alternate every orbit unless the spacecraft goes into a pointed mode ( which occurs rarely ) .",
    "in addition , the spacecraft performs a roll about the z - axis as it orbits .",
    "because the orientation of a source with respect to the gbm detectors varies as a function of time , the detector response as a function of angle must be accounted for . a detailed",
    "instrument modeling and measurement program has been used to develop the gbm instrument response as a function of direction @xcite , which is incorporated into the occultation analysis .",
    "it should be noted that the gbm occultation sensitivity exceeds that of batse at energies below @xmath1 kev and above @xmath2 mev , since gbm has only a be window on the nai detectors instead of the plastic scintillator , aluminum honeycomb , and aluminum window that covered the front of the batse scintillators @xcite . due to its larger area ,",
    "batse was more sensitive than gbm between 25 kev and 1.5 mev .",
    "gbm has two continuous data types : ctime data with nominal 0.256-second time resolution and 8-channel spectral resolution and cspec data with nominal 4.096-second time resolution and 128-channel spectral resolution .",
    "the results presented in this paper use the low - spectral resolution ctime data .",
    "detailed spectral analyses using the higher resolution cspec data are reserved for future work .",
    "the data are selected to remove gamma - ray bursts , solar flares , electron precipitation events , cosmic ray events , terrestrial gamma - ray flashes , etc .",
    "the occultation technique requires an input catalog of predetermined source locations , and currently we are monitoring 82 sources . for each day",
    ", the occultation times for each source are calculated using the known spacecraft positions .",
    "the time of the occultation step is taken to be the time for which the transmission of a 100 kev gamma ray through the atmospheric column is 50% .",
    "the time at which the atmospheric transmission reaches 50% is energy dependent , e.g. for energies less than 100 kev , a setting step will occur earlier ( see fig .  [ crabstep ] ) .",
    "this energy dependence is accounted for in the calculation of the atmospheric transmission function , @xmath23 .",
    "for each occultation step , a 4-minute window is defined that is centered on the 100 kev occultation time . for each energy band",
    ", the count rates in the window are fit separately for each detector viewing the source of interest . in each of these detectors ,",
    "the count rates are fitted with a quadratic background plus source models for the source of interest and each interfering source that appears in the window .",
    "the source models consist of @xmath23 and a time - dependent model count rate , derived from the time - dependent detector response convolved with an assumed source spectrum .",
    "each source model is multiplied by a scaling factor , and the source flux is then computed by a joint fit to the scaling factors across all detectors in the fit . the best - fit scaling factor",
    "is then multiplied by the assumed source flux model integrated over the energy band to obtain the photon flux .",
    "up to 31 occultation steps are possible for a given source in a day , and these steps are summed to get a single daily average flux .",
    "this technique can be used with either the nai or bgo detectors , though the analysis presented here uses only the nai detectors .",
    "a more complete description of the gbm implementation of the occultation technique will be given in @xcite .",

    "the light curve has been binned 5 days per data point .",
    "the vertical dashed lines at mjd 55244 and mjd 55289 mark the flaring region used to derive the average fluxes in table  [ flux_table ] .",
    "the fluxes are in crab units , and the horizontial solid lines mark the zero flux levels.,width=294 ]    the highly variable lmxb and black hole candidate gx 339 - 4 @xcite is characterized by rapid time variability and low / hard x - ray states similar to those of cyg x-1 @xcite .",
    "the results of analysis of both batse @xcite and _ integral _",
    "@xcite data have indicated the presence of high energy emission above 200 kev during previous outbursts , with the _ integral _ spectrum fitted by a thermal comptonization component together with synchrotron or self - synchrotron emission possibly originating at the base of a jet .",
    "gx 339 - 4 was observed by maxi to begin a large flare event starting on 2010 january 3 @xcite .",
    "the flux observed by gbm began to increase starting in early 2010 january and continued to increase up to a level of @xmath84 mcrab ( 1225 kev ) , @xmath85 mcrab ( 2550 kev ) , @xmath86 mcrab ( 50100 kev ) , and @xmath87 mcrab ( 100300 kev ) by early - april 2010 , after which it began to rapidly decrease .",
    "it returned to quiescence in the higher energy bands by mid - april and in the 1250 kev band by the end of april .",
    "the fluxes for gx 339 - 4 in table  [ flux_table ] are integrated over the days when gx 339 - 4 was observed to be in a high gamma - ray state , mjd 5524455289 .",
    "similar to cyg x-1 and xte j1752 - 223 , the flux ratios measured by gbm ( @xmath88 and @xmath89 , with no measurable intensity above 300 kev ) appear consistent with a @xmath82 power law steepening above 100 kev to at least @xmath83 .",
    "note that there was a weaker double - peaked flare starting around mjd 54888 @xcite and lasting until around mjd 55000 ( see fig .",
    "[ gx339 ] ) . while the light curve in the 100300 kev band is suggestive of positive emission in this band , it is only marginally significant ( @xmath90 ) with an average flux of @xmath91 mcrab .",
    "using the earth occultation technique , the gbm instrument on _ fermi _ has been monitoring the gamma - ray sky in the @xmath92 kev energy range , providing daily measurements for a catalog of 82 sources , including 72 x - ray binaries , five agn , two magnetars , two cataclysmic variables , the crab , and the sun . after the first two years of the _ fermi _ mission , the earth occultation technique applied to the gbm ctime data has been used to detect six persistent sources and two transients at energies above 100 kev with a significance greater than @xmath3 , demonstrating the capability of gbm to observe and monitor such sources .",
    "two of the sources , the crab and cyg x-1 , were detected with high significance above 300 kev .",
    "light curves of all eight sources were presented in four broad energy bands from 12500 kev .",
    "the outbursts from the transient sources xte j1752 - 223 and gx 339 - 4 were clearly visible in the 1250 kev , 50100 kev , and 100300 kev broad bands .",
    "xte j1752 - 223 was a previously unknown source , and the gbm light curves in the hard x - ray / low energy gamma - ray energy bands are consistent with the initial classification of this object as a black hole candidate in a bright low / hard state .",
    "the steep decline of the hard x - ray emission starting around mjd 55215 corresponded to an increase in the soft x - ray flux @xcite , indicating the transition from the low / hard state to a soft state .",
    "when xte j1752 - 223 returned to the low / hard state around mjd 55282 @xcite , the hard x - ray emission was below the sensitivity limit of gbm .",
    "monitoring of cyg x-1 at the onset of a recent state transition showed a steady decrease in the 100300 kev flux that began about 19 days before the soft x - ray flux began to rise .",
    "as of mjd 55419 , cyg x-1 remains in a soft state , and we will continued to monitor cyg x-1 in anticipation of the transition back to the canonical hard state .    while the gbm ctime data used here does not have enough spectral resolution to produce detailed spectra , the flux ratios between the 1250 kev broad band and the 50100 , 100300 , and 300500 kev broad bands for the crab are generally consistent with those inferred from the measured _ integral _ spectrum , with the gbm results suggesting a slightly harder spectrum .",
    "the flux ratios observed for the transient sources xte j1752 - 223 and gx 339 - 4 are similar to cyg x-1 when it is in its canonical low / hard state , again consistent with these transients being observed in bright low / hard states .",
    "future work will use the gbm cspec data , with its finer energy binning , to examine the detailed spectra for all of these sources , with particular emphasis on the low energy gamma - ray energy range .",
    "also , the bgo detectors , with their greater sensitivity at higher energies , will be used to obtain additional measurements at energies above 150 kev .",
    "several of the detected sources have spectral breaks or cutoffs in the 100300 kev range , and we will look for these features and monitor their evolution over time .    we will continue to add to the list of sources being monitored as appropriate .",
    "we have detected cen a with gbm in all energy bands up to 300 kev .",
    "batse detected several bl lac objects known to exhibit flaring activity on the time scale of days @xcite .",
    "the flaring behavior of blazars is sometimes accompanied by a shift upwards in the peak of the synchroton spectrum ( e.g. above 100 kev in the 1997 mrk 501 flare @xcite ) , making detection of these sources possible with gbm .",
    "while none have been detected so far , we will continue to expand our monitoring program to include the blazars with flares detected in other wavelengths .",
    "we plan to expand our monitoring program to include other agn as well .",
    "we continue to fine tune the algorithms and work to reduce the systematic errors in the flux determination . in the case of the batse earth occultation analysis",
    ", there was clear evidence for the presence of sources in the data which were not in the occultation input catalog and which caused uncertainty in the assignment of fluxes to the sources that were in the input catalog .",
    "we see similar evidence for these uncataloged sources with gbm , especially below about 50 kev . to address this ,",
    "our approach is two - fold : ( 1 ) we compare our gbm measurements with overlapping energy bands from other operating missions and regularly update our catalog as new transient outbursts are observed with gbm or other instruments .",
    "light curves are regenerated if needed after catalog updates .",
    "( 2 ) we are developing an imaging technique for gbm to produce an all - sky map of hard x - ray / soft gamma - ray sources .",
    "this map will then be used to identify sources not currently in the gbm occultation catalog , to expand the catalog , and to reduce the uncertainties in the measured fluxes .",
