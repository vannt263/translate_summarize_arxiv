    "<S> we present a class of three - dimensional solitary waves solutions of the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation , which governs the dynamics of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) . by imposing an external controlling potential , </S>",
    "<S> a desired time - dependent shape of the localized bec excitation is obtained . </S>",
    "<S> the stability of some obtained localized solutions is checked by solving the time - dependent gp equation numerically with analytic solutions as initial conditions . </S>",
    "<S> the analytic solutions can be used to design external potentials to control the localized becs in experiment . </S>"
