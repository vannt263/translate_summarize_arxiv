    "modern condensed matter theory borrows concepts from quantum information theory , n particular , entanglement .",
    "there is an explosive growth of applications of these conceps @xcite .",
    "although the measures of entanglement are not linear in density matrix and as such can not be directly related to quantum observables , these measures proved to provide insight into complex structure of many - body wave functions and in many cases can be efficiently computed numerically .",
    "@xcite most applications are restricted to an equilibrium situation where the object of interest is the wave function of the ground state of a system @xmath0 .",
    "the system is cut in to two subsystems @xmath1 ( typically , in real space ) .",
    "partial trace over a subsystem gives a reduced density matrix @xmath2 in hilbert space of another subsystem .",
    "roughly , the von neumann entropy of @xmath3 can be ascribed to the boundary between the subsystems .",
    "there is a number of illuminating theoretical results @xcite related to the von neumann entropy of the boundary and its scaling with the boundary area .",
    "not only entropy is under scrunity : the attention is paid to and the information is gathered from the whole spectum of the reduced density matrix @xmath3.@xcite the information about the spectrum can be compactified to a set of quantities that have been introduced in the context of information theory by alfred rnyi @xcite and are called _",
    "rnyi entropies_. we define them as follows : @xcite @xmath4 logs of @xmath5 are obviously extensive quantities : if @xmath3 can be presented as a direct product over a number of subsystems , their contrubutions to @xmath6 add .",
    "the von neumann entropy is obtained by taking a formal limit @xmath7    several works address time evolution of entropies in the course of transition processes like a quantum quench.@xcite .",
    "there are interesting results concerning von neumann entropy production in stationary non - equilibrium systems , in particular , in quantum point contacts @xcite .",
    "a simplest quantum point contact is a single - channel conductor with transmission coefficient @xmath8 , that connects two electronic reservoirs .",
    "the entropy flow for zero temperature in the reservoirs was shown to be @xcite @xmath9 here , @xmath10 is the number of electrons per unit time that attempt to transfer the contact , @xmath11 the energy flow to either reservoir is given by @xmath12 .",
    "the approach of @xcite was rather heuristic relying on the representation of the electron many - body state in terms of a sequence of individual single - electron scattering events @xcite , that is instrumental in the field of full counting statistics .",
    "levitov and klich have rederived these results with more microscopic approach , extented those to the case of a general time - dependent scatterer and discovered a remarkable correspondence between the entropy flow and full counting statistics of electron transfers .",
    "this has been further elaborated in @xcite .",
    "there are two interesting peculiarities in the relation ( [ eq : beenakker ] ) that have not received a proper discussion so far .",
    "firstly , non - analiticity of the expression ( [ eq : beenakker ] ) at small @xmath8 should indicate an intriguing divergence of perturbation series in @xmath8 that measures coupling strength between the reservoirs .",
    "secondly , second law of thermodynamics relates the entropy and heat increments for a system in thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath13 . from this",
    "one would conjecture the relation between entropy and energy flows , @xmath14 that would seem to have a textbook status .",
    "however , the result ( [ eq : beenakker ] ) is not compatible with this conjecture . the initial motivation for the research presented in this article was to understand these peculiarities in a general calculable framework rather than for a restrictive case of quantum point contact .",
    "the main result of the article is that the flows of rnyi entropies ( re - flows in short ) are well - defined in standard condensed matter setups comprising two reservoirs connected by a junction .",
    "importantly , they permit a detailed evaluation in the framework of a quantum perturbation theory developed here .",
    "this is in contrast to the entropy flow : albeit the latter can be readibly obtained by analytical continuation from integer to continous @xmath15 .",
    "we study second and fourth order of perturbation theory .",
    "the second - order results were shown to be very special : they satisfy the `` textbook '' relation ( [ eq : textbook ] ) as well as some extra `` intuitive '' relations outlined in the text .",
    "this is because the second - order results can be put into direct correspondence with the transition events taking place in the system . neither this correspondence nor `` intuitive '' relations hold for forth - order corrections .",
    "these corrections exhibit non - analytical low - temperature behavior manifesting non - analytical dependence of the flows on coupling strength in the limit of weak couplings and vanishing temperatures .",
    "an obvious point of critisism is that the re - flows are `` unphysical '' since they are non - linear in density matrix and therefore can not be readily asscociated with ( the flows of ) measurable quantities .",
    "the author shares the opinion and idea of levitov and klich @xcite that the flows of quantum infromation quantities may be related to the statistics of flows of quantum observables by universal relations whose general form is yet to discover .",
    "if this is true , a measurement of such statistics would in fact constitute a measurement of an `` unphysical '' flow . in any case ,",
    "the re - flows characterize information exchange between the reservoirs in a rather detailed way .",
    "this makes their evaluation useful .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : measures ] , we detail and illustrate the definition of rnyi entropies . in section",
    "[ sec : flows ] , we show that re - flows can be associated with conserving currents , these currents being rather similar to electric or energy current through a junction in quantum transport setups .",
    "next section [ sec : perturbation ] is devoted to the description of a generalized keldysh technique that enables perturbative calculation of re - flows in an arbitrary setup .",
    "we evaluate the flows in the secon - order approximation in section [ sec : second ] .",
    "the second - order approximation is characterized by a set of specific relations , those outlined in sections [ sec : fermigas ] , [ sec : master ] . in section [ sec : fourth ]",
    "we derive the fourth - order corrections .",
    "we demonstrate that these corrections diverge in the limit of vanishing temperature ( section [ sec : divergence ] ) indicating non - analytical dependence of the flows in the limit of small couplings .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "let us discuss the definition and straightforward properties of rnyi entropies .",
    "we start with an isolated finite quantum system that is characterized by density matrix @xmath3 .",
    "we define the rnyi entropies as traces of integer powers of @xmath3 , @xmath16 this definition can be easily extended to non - integer @xmath15 , @xmath17 this identifies @xmath5 as laplace transform of the spectral function of the operator @xmath18 .",
    "this identification permits to relate the von neumann entropy and rnyi entropies , @xmath19    if the system is in thermodynamic equilibrium at temperature @xmath13 , the rnyi entropies are readily expressed in terms of the temperature - dependent free energy @xmath20(e.g .",
    "@xcite ) , @xmath21 the rnyi entropies can be easily computed for simple non - equilibrium quantum systems as well .",
    "the example we will use in this article concerns free fermions in a system of single - particle levels labelled by @xmath22 .",
    "we ascribe the levels arbitraty filling factors @xmath23 .",
    "the density matrix of the system reads @xmath24 @xmath25 being number operator , @xmath26 being annihilation operator in the level @xmath22 , @xmath27 . from this",
    ", the rnyi entropies read @xmath28    for a degenerate fermi gas in thermal equilibtrium with constant density of states @xmath29 near the fermi energy , this reduces to @xmath30    the quantum evolution of the system is governed by a hamiltonian @xmath31 .",
    "the same hamitonian determines the evolution of the density matrix , @xmath32.\\ ] ] since the density matrices in different momets of time are related by unitary transform , the trace of any power of @xmath3 does not depend on time .",
    "we just proved that rnyi entropies provide a set of _ conserved measures _ for density matrix of an isolated quantum system , @xmath33 in similarity to the conserved physical quantities like energy or change .",
    "the difference is that @xmath5 are not linear in density matrix and therefore can not be immediately associated with any quantum observables .    while these definitions and properties may seem straightforward , there are some caveats to discuss .",
    "they are related to the traditional classical definition of entropy and its use . to illustrate ,",
    "let us start with the non - equilibrium fermi system in a pure state where @xmath23 are either @xmath34 or @xmath35 .",
    "obviously , @xmath36 for this pure state .",
    "let us take @xmath31 that involves weak interaction between the fermions .",
    "common knowledge suggests that the interaction causes thermalization of the fermion distribution function . after some time",
    ", the filling factors @xmath23 will correspond to a fermi distribution at some effective temperature @xmath37 that depends on the initial state .",
    "it may seem that the entropies are now given by eq .",
    "[ eq : thermalfermi ] and thus differ from @xmath34 .",
    "however , they must conserve ! indeed , after the hamiltonian evolution the system is still in a pure state .",
    "the solution to this apparent paradox is that eq .",
    "[ eq : noneqfermi ] can not be used for an interacting fermion system whatever small the interaction is .",
    "we could have used an alternative definition of the entopies that is close to the original classical definition of boltzman .",
    "namely , we could reduce the true density matrix @xmath3 to @xmath38 matrices @xmath39 by taking partial trace over all fermion fock states not involving the level @xmath22 , take the diagonal elements of these matrices and substitute them to [ eq : noneqfermi ] .",
    "such alternative definition might even seem more useful , for instance , for description of thermalization in an electron gas . however , this definition would necessary involve entirely subjective choice of a basis ( that of non - interacting fermion fock states ) and would not give rise to conveniently conserved measures . on these grounds",
    ", we stick to `` quantum '' definition ( [ eq : definition ] ) .",
    "let us now consider a bipartition of the hilbert space @xmath40 corresponding to two systems @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "we can now define two sets of rnyi entropies , @xmath43 where the reduced density matrices in two subspaces are defined with the aid of the partial traces in these subspaces , @xmath44 if the quantum evolutions of the systems are completely independent , @xmath45 @xmath46 being operators involving the corresponding subspaces only , both sets provide the conserved measures , @xmath47    it is interesting to note that the sets of rnyi entropies are not the only conserved measures characteristic for a bipartition . any polynomial in density matrix that is invariant with respect to the group @xmath48 of unitary transforms in two subspaces , would provide such a measure . to give a minimal example ,",
    "let us label the states in @xmath41(@xmath42 ) with latin ( greek ) indeces .",
    "the quantity @xmath49 is a conserved measure that can be reduced neither to the rnyi entropies of the systems nor to the rnyi entropy of the whole system .",
    "the characterization of all such measures forms an interesting research task beyond the scope of this article .",
    "let us complicate the bipartition situation by including a hamiltonian coupling between the systems @xmath41 and @xmath42 , @xmath50 @xmath51 being an operator that involves degrees of freedom in both subspaces .",
    "we will assume that the systems @xmath41 and @xmath42 are infitely large and are characterized by continuous excitation spectrum given by @xmath52 respectively .",
    "however , @xmath53 couples a relatively small number of degrees of freedom in both systems .",
    "it is convenient to assume that the systems @xmath41 , @xmath42are in thermal equilibrium at different temperatures @xmath54 and/or chemical potentials @xmath55 and thus play a role of reservoirs .",
    "the coupling is such that it does not lead to equilibration of @xmath56 ( @xmath57 .",

    "the junction connecting the two is associated with coupling hamiltonian @xmath58 . in similarity with the flows of charge and energy",

    "these leads are connected by a junction .",
    "simplest coupling that we will use in our examples is the tunneling hamiltonian @xmath59 that describes particle transfer between the leads .",
    "it is important in quantum transport setups that the value to measure experimentally and compute theoretically is a flow of a conserved quantity , electric charge being a simplest and most usefull example . in principle",
    ", one defines a flow of charge through a cross - section of the setup , this cross - section may also define the bipartition .",
    "owing to conservation , this flow does not depend on the cross - section .",
    "therefore , the exact bipartition is also not important . owing to this ,",
    "the current is said to depend on the properties of the junction rather than on details of the reservoirs .",
    "this enables the experimental investigation of nanostructures : a signal in a measurement of a non - conserving quantity would be most probably dominated by massive leads rather than by a small nanostructure , while the flow of conserved charge is determined by the nanostructure forming the junction between the leads .",
    "the same pertains energy flow .",
    "energy and charge are not the only conserved quatities : approximately conserved spin currents @xcite provide another practical example .",

    "@xcite    from analogy with the flows of conserved quantities in quantum transport setups , we conjecture that there are finite flows of conserved measures , rnyi entropies ( re - flows ) , to each subsystem @xmath41 and @xmath42 , @xmath60 owing to conservation of rneyi entropy in each system , the re - flows would not depend on exact bipartition of the system and are determined by properties of the junction that is in principle described by @xmath51 .",
    "there is an important difference . for physical quantities",
    "the conservation holds in the whole system as well as in each subsystems . for instance , elecrtical currents to each lead must satisfy @xmath61.@xcite as far as rnyi entropies are concerned , there is no exact conservation law for a sum @xmath62 at finite @xmath51 , although these quatities are extensive .",
    "there is a conservation law for the total rnyi entropy @xmath63 .",

    "we will use a perturbation technique in @xmath51 and keep the calculation as general as possible .",
    "we assume `` adiabatic switching '' of the perturbation@xcite : far in the past the coupling is absent , and the density matrix is a direct product over subspaces , @xmath67 ( as above , we label the states in subspaces @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) with latin ( greek ) indexes . )",

    "this correction does not bring anything new and we disregard these diagramms in further consideration .    a diagram involving two different worlds is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : fourth - order ] .",
    "we see that in general the black contour entering a world with perturbations exits it with a different state index . for a particular case",
    "when these indices are the same , @xmath154 , the diagramm diverges upon integration over time .",
    "this is not surprising since we expand @xmath155 .",
    "the fourth - order expansion thus contains terms @xmath156 , @xmath157 being the second - order contibution to the rate that we have already calculated . indeed , the diagram with @xmath82 is proportional to @xmath158 and therefore does not contibute to fourth - order correction to the flow .",
    "we thus concentrate on the case @xmath159 .",
    "we call this diagram `` quantum '' since we will see that it does not permit an interpretation in terms of `` classical '' transition events .",
    "all expressions for @xmath160 in this section give fourth - order corrections to these quantities .",
    "there are 16 diagramms of this sort corresponding to the number of ways the pairs of @xmath161 in each world can be placed on bra and ket contours .",
    "[ fig : fourth - order ]   in two different worlds , only these two worlds are shown .",
    "the letters on the contours label the states involved.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=35.0% ]    summing up all of them , we can present the fourth - order correction in the following form : @xmath162 the structure of the matrix elements in the `` amplitude '' @xmath163 is the same as for an amplitude of the transition from the state @xmath89 to the state @xmath164 , that is , without the change of the state of the subsystem @xmath42 .",
    "such transition would seem to involve a virtual state @xmath165 .",
    "however , the rest of the expression for @xmath163 does not support this interpretation : rather , probabilities enter in a form suggesting that the transition takes place between one of the states @xmath166 and the state @xmath167 . therefore",
    ", the expression can be associated with no `` classical '' transition and corresponds to no actual transition rate .",
    "let us assume that the probabilities in the system @xmath41 depend only on energies of the corresponding states .",
    "then it follows from @xmath168 that @xmath169 .",
    "the term in @xmath163 with the energy difference in the denominator vanishes and the flow reduces to @xmath170 we notice that if both systems are in thermal equilibrium , it follows from @xmath171 that @xmath172 and the `` amplitudes '' @xmath163 vanish .    let us compute the fourth - order contribution for non - equilibrium fermi gas .",
    "we pick up two levels in system @xmath41 , @xmath173 , with @xmath174 .",
    "their contibution to @xmath5 reads @xmath175 .",
    "let the state @xmath112 correspond to @xmath176 and state @xmath113 correspond to @xmath177 : the probablilities of these states equal @xmath178 .",
    "the `` amplitude '' @xmath163 is contributed by all levels @xmath121 in the system @xmath42 with the energy @xmath179 .",
    "there are two possible `` virtual states '' @xmath167 .",
    "first possibility is an empty level @xmath121 and both levels @xmath173 occupied ( @xmath180 , @xmath181 , @xmath182 ) .",
    "second possibility is an occupied level @xmath121 and empty levels @xmath173(@xmath183 , @xmath184 , @xmath185 ) .",
    "owing to anticommutativity of fermionic creation / annihilation operators , these two contibutions to the `` amplitude '' come with opposite sign yielding @xmath186 to get the contibution of @xmath173 to the re - flow , we square @xmath163 , multiply it with @xmath187 , and divide with the contribution @xmath188 of these levels to rnyi entropy .",
    "next to it , we sum over all states in the energy interval @xmath189 and integrate over energy to obtain the total re - flow .",
    "we obtain @xmath190 where @xmath191 is defined as @xmath192",
    "we will now demonstrate that the `` quantum '' contibution derived manifests serious problems with term - by - term perturbation theory in the limit of vanishing temperature , indicating non - analytical dependence of the flows on coupling strength in the limit of weak couplings and vanishing temperatures .",
    "first let us note that the contibution seems to have an evident zero - temperature limit , namely zero , at least if the ground state of the system @xmath41 is not degenerate . indeed , delta - funcion in eq .",
    "[ eq:4th - general ] can not be satisfied for any state @xmath193 . however , analythical continuation to non - integer @xmath15 gives rise to problems .",
    "let is illustrate this computing ( [ eq:4th - fermi - answer ] ) assuming thermal distribution and the difference between chemical potentials in @xmath41 and @xmath42 , @xmath194 , is much bigger than @xmath195 . to this end",
    ", we can set @xmath196 in eq . disgerarging the energy dependence of @xmath197 near fermi surface , we obtain @xmath198 while the flow vanishes at vanishing temperature",
    ", it has a finite limit @xmath199 at @xmath118 where it should vanish .",
    "this signals the divergence of fourth - order contribution to the flow of von neumann entropy .",
    "indeed , from the general expression ( [ eq:4th - f - of - e ] ) we deduce that @xmath200 that is , the states with lesser probabilities @xmath201 contibute most to the entropy flow ! for fermi gas example , the entropy flow reduces to @xmath202 for equal temperatures in the systems @xmath41 and @xmath42 , this gives @xmath203 the fourth - order contibution to the entropy flow thus diverges exponentally upon @xmath116 .",
    "in this paper , we have shown that the flows of rnyi entropies are well - defined for common setups encompassing a junction between two reservoirs @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "they are similar to flows of physical conserved quanities like energy and charge .",
    "they vanish in thermal equilibrium and can be induced by the difference of chemical potentials / temperatues in the reservoirs .",
    "the flows characterize ( quantum ) information transfer between the reservoirs and generalize the flow of von neumann entropy .",
    "we develop a general quantum perturbation technique to compute these flows , this involves a set of parallel worlds .",
    "we consider second and forth order terms . in second - order approximation ,",
    "the flows can be related to golden rule transition events . as such",
    ", they satisfy a set of `` intuitive '' relations expressed by eqs .",
    "[ eq : textbook ] , [ eq : primitive ] , [ eq : boltzmann ] .",
    "our analysis of fourth - order corrections reveals interesting physics : the `` intuitive '' relations appear to be wrong , and corrections exhibit divergences in the limit of low temperatures manifesting an intriguing non - analytical dependence of the flows on coupling strength in the limit of weak couplings and vanishing temperatures .",
