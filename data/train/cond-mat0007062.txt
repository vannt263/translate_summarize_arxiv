    "the difference between the exponent @xmath188 and @xmath187 is due in part to the weak , but significant density dependence of the effective pair potential between the centers of mass of self - avoiding polymers@xcite , which leads to an additional density dependence of the rpa or mf equation of state ( [ eq2.14 ] ) .",

    "in fact , for the type of polymer cm potentials considered , this seems to occur just below the @xmath212 point temperature where @xmath215 .",
    "it is tempting to speculate that the coil - globule transition , which also typically occurs slightly below the @xmath212 temperature , is related to the point at which the effective pair potential becomes catastrophic .",

    "( [ eq2.14a ] ) and ( [ eq2.19 ] ) , one may extract the following compressibility and virial estimates of the 2nd and 3rd virial coefficients : @xmath224 as shown in figs .",
    "[ figb.1 ] and [ figb.2 ] , the exact virial coefficients are bracketed by the virial and compressibility estimates extracted from the rpa : @xmath225 the large deviations shown in figs .",
    "[ figb.1 ] and [ figb.2 ] imply that , in contrast to the case at high densities , the rpa is expected to perform poorly at very low densities and large @xmath94 , where it is thermodynamically inconsistent .",
    "in fact , @xmath226 even goes negative for @xmath227 ! the effect this has on the rpa virial e.o.s .  is demonstrated in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig2.5 ] and in fig .",
    "[ figb.3 ] .",
    "however , even though for @xmath228 , @xmath226 is @xmath229 less than @xmath213 , and @xmath230 is over @xmath231 larger than @xmath217 , @xmath232 remains within @xmath233 of the exact e.o.s .  over the entire density range !",
    "thus , in spite of the fact that the rpa virial approximation grossly misrepresents the first two virial coefficients , it nevertheless accurately describes the e.o.s . , implying that the density is not a good expansion parameter for the gcm fluid phase .",
    "a further hint at the breakdown of the virial expansion comes from summing the virial series to all orders in the high temperature limit , where , from the diagramattic representation of the virial coefficients@xcite , it can be shown that the @xmath234 are given by : @xmath235 for @xmath236 .",
    "this , @xmath226 ( [ eqb.6b ] ) is added , recovers exactly the virial rpa equation of state ( [ eq2.19 ] ) , which can only be expanded in powers of density for @xmath237 , i.e.  for @xmath238 this implies that in the high - temperature limit , the virial expansion does not converge for densities higher that @xmath239 . for @xmath228 , there is no convergent density expansion of the rpa virial e.o.s .  for @xmath240 .",
    "a similar breakdown in convergence may be expected for the exact virial expansion .",
    "the physical reason for this lack of convergence lies in the possibility of multiple overlap of soft core particles , giving much more weight to higher order cluster integrals compared to the case of fluids with hard - core interactions .    at large enough @xmath94 ,",
    "the overlap probability becomes exponentially small , and the gcm can be mapped onto an effective hard - sphere system@xcite .",
    "one possible criterion for the mapping is to equate the second virial coefficients . from this",
    "we obtain an effective hard - sphere radius of : @xmath241 which for @xmath60 is well approximated by the empirical expression @xmath242 . for large @xmath94 and low densities ,",
    "the equation of state resembles that of hard - spheres ( see e.g. fig.[figb.3 ] ) , suggesting that a virial expansion does indeed exist for low densities .",
    "we note that for this large value of @xmath94 , the true virial expansion appears to have a larger radius of convergence than that of the rpa virial e.o.s .",
    ", for which @xmath243 . for @xmath75",
    "there is a freezing transition at roughly the density expected for the effective hard - sphere system ( @xmath244 ) , not far above which any effective virial expansion is expected to break down ( see e.g.  the inset of fig .  [ figb.2 ] ) .",
    "in fact , since gaussian potentials do nt have an infinitely hard core , it is possible to achieve much higher densities than are normally available to simple liquids . at the lowest densities the fluid",
    "is described by a linear second virial theory e.o.s . , but as the density increases , this rapidly turns over to a mean field like linear e.o.s .  with a different ( larger ) slope .",
    "thus , even though the e.o.s .  is well described by a first order polynomial in the density @xmath46 it is not at all equivalent to a second virial theory , and the density is generally not a good expansion parameter .",
