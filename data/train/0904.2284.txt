    "theory of solitons and modern theory of deformations of associative algebras have almost the same age , a little above forty . geographically they were born pretty near to each other : one in the princeton university [ 1,2 ] and another in the pennsylvania university [ 3,4 ] .",
    "moreover both these theories have used one common principal concept , namely , the concept of deformation .",
    "an idea of isospectral deformations was one of the first basic ideas in the theory of integrable equations [ 5 ] .",
    "then , the dressing method [ 6 ] , bi - hamiltonian structures [ 7 ] as well as the backlund and darboux transformations represent particular realizations of the various classes of deformations for solutions of solitons equations ( see e.g.[8,9 ] and references therein ) . on the other hand ,",
    "one of the approaches to the deformation theory of associative algebras , proposed in [ 4 ] was  ... to take the point of view that the objects being deformed are not merely algebras , but essentially algebra with a fixed basis  and to treat  the algebraic set of all structure constants as parameter space for deformation theory  .    in spite of this sharing of the idea of deformation the theory of integrable equations and deformation theory for associative algebras for the first twenty five years",
    "have been developed independently , without any interconnection and influence of one to another .",
    "an apparent difference between the basic objects in these theories , i.e. between the dependent variables in the nonlinear equations and structure constants of associative algebras , seemed to be so big that , it was thought , these theories can not have anything in common .",
    "the situation has changed drastically in the beginning of nineties with the discovery of witten [ 10 ] and dijkgraaf - verlinde - verlinde [ 11 ] .",
    "they demonstrated that the function f which defines the correlation function @xmath0 etc in the perturbed two - dimensional topological field theory obeys the system of equations    @xmath1    where j , k , l , m=1,2, ... ,n and @xmath2 are constants . in terms of @xmath3 defined as    @xmath4    the wdvv equation ( 1 )",
    "is of the form    @xmath5    which is nothing but the condition of associativity for the structure constants @xmath3 of the n - dimensional  algebra of primary fields @xmath6 [ 10,11 ] .",
    "thus , each solution @xmath7 of the wdvv equation describes a deformation of the structure constants by the formula ( 2 ) .",
    "this result has provided us with the remarkable realization of the gerstenhaber s approach mentioned above . on the other hand",
    "it has revealed a striking connection between the theory of deformations of associative algebras and nonlinear partial differential equations ( pdes ) .",
    "wdvv equation ( 1 ) and the formulae ( 2,3 ) have been immediately interpreted and formalized by dubrovin [ 12,13 ] as the theory of frobenius manifolds .",
    "it provides us with the classes of deformations of the so - called frobenius algebras .",
    "an extension of this approach to general algebras and correspoinding f - manifolds has been given in [ 14 ] .",
    "it was shown within these theories that not only wdvv equation , but many other integrable systems of nonlinear pdes both dispersionless and dispersive describe deformations of associative algebras ( see e.g. [ 13 , 15 - 18 ] ) . in few years",
    "the interconnection between the theories of frobenius and f - manifolds on one side and the theory of integrable nonlinear pdes on the other has been well established .",
    "an alternative approach to deformations of structure constants for associative algebras proposed recently in the papers [ 19 - 24 ] has allowed us to construct wider classes of deformations .",
    "they include the coisotropic [ 19,20 ] , quantum [ 21 ] , discrete [ 22,23 ] deformations as well as general deformations generated by the so - called deformation driving algebra ( dda ) [ 24 ] .",
    "these classes of deformations are governed by dispersionless , dispersive , discrete and difference integrable systems with some well - known integrable equations among them .",
    "one of the characteristic features of the method developed in [ 19 - 24 ] is that it allows us to construct different classes of deformations , for instance , coisotropic , quantum and discrete deformations of the same algebra just choosing different ddas .",
    "theory of integrable systems is nowadays a well - developed and rich theory which includes a vast variety of nonlinear ordinary and partial differential equations and discrete equations ( see e.g.[25 - 28 ] ) .",
    "theory of discrete integrable systems form a very important branch of the whole theory .",
    "toda lattice [ 29 ] was the first such equation studied by the inverse scattering method [ 30,31 ] .",
    "after that several methods to construct and solve integrable differential - difference and discrete equations have been developed ( see e.g. [ 32 - 40 ] ) .",
    "pretty soon it became clear that some of the discrete integrable equations play a fundamental role in the whole theory : they are the generating equations for the infinite hierarchies of continuous integrable equations and encode the basic algebraic structures associated with these hierarchies ( see e.g. [ 35 - 41 ] ) .",
    "discrete integrable equations have served also as the basic tool in the formulation and study of discrete geometry ( see [ 42 - 44 ] ) and discrete complex analysis [ 45 - 47 ] .",
    "moreover some of discrete equations are directly connected with basic theorems , like the menelaus theorem , of the classical geometry [ 48 - 51 ] . due to their significance discrete integrable systems",
    "certainly merit a profound study from all possible viewpoints .",
    "our principal goal here is to discuss recent results on the interrelations between some basic discrete integrable systems and discrete deformations of structure constants of associative algebras .",
    "we will present first a general theory of deformations of associative algebras generated by the lie algebra dda and governed by the so - called central system  ( cs ) of equations .",
    "we will show how discrete boussinesq and wdvv equations , discrete schwarzian kadomtsev - petviashvili ( dskp ) equation , discrete bilinear hirota - miwa equations for kp and bkp hierarchies , discrete darboux system and other discrete systems arise as the particular versions of the css which govern discrete and difference deformations of associative algebras .",
    "difference cs has a simple geometrical meaning of vanishing ",
    "discrete  riemann curvature tensor with the structure constants @xmath3 playing the role of  discrete  christoffel symbols .",
    "such an interpretation of discrete equations allows us to understand better the algebraic backgrounds of the theory of discrete integrable systems and associated constructions in discrete geometry .",
    "we will show , for instance ,  that the dskp equation or menelaus relation and hirota - miwa bilinear equation for kp hierarchy are just the associativity conditions for the structure constants of certain algebras .",
    "the consistency around cube and multi - dimensional consistency discussed in discrete geometry also has a meaning of conditions of associativity for elements of algebras .",
    "on the other hand the transfer of the old concept of gauge equivalency from the theory of integrable systems ( see e.g. [ 25 - 28 ] ) to deformation theory introduces the notion of gauge equivalence classes of deformations . in geometrical terms",
    "this leads to the notion of the gauge equivalency between geometrical configurations .",
    "menelaus and kp six points configurations on the plane represent an important example of such situation .",
    "interpretation of discrete integrable systems as equations governing deformations of associative algebras provides us also with a method for construction of integrable discretizations of integrable pdes .",
    "this problem has been intensively discussed for many years and several methods have been proposed ( see e.g. [ 32 - 40 ] ) . in our approach",
    "an integrable discretization is just the change of dda from the heisenberg algebra to the algebra of shifts for an associative algebra in the given basis , i.e. for the same structure constants . interinfluence of the theories of integrable systems and deformations of associative algebras is revealed to be rather fruitful .    the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we briefly review some well - known integrable equations , namely , the discrete korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) equation , discrete schwarzian kdv ( dskdv ) equation , dskp equation , discrete hirota - miwa equation and  their connection with the backlund and darboux transformations for continuous integrable equations . we discuss also the indications on the possible role of associative algebras in these constructions . in section 3 we present a general theory of deformations of structure constants for associative algebras . a closed left ideal generated by elements representing the multiplication table plays the central role in this consruction",
    ". deformations of structure constants are generated by the dda and are governed by the corresponding cs .",
    "a subclass of deformations , the so - called integrable deformations , is discussed in section 4 .",
    "the cs for such deformations has a geometrical meaning of vanishing discretized riemann curvature tensor .",
    "discrete deformations of the three - dimensional associative algebra and discrete boussinesq equation are studied in section 5 .",
    "next section 6 is devoted to the discrete and semi - discrete versions of the wdvv equation .",
    "deformations generated by the three - dimensional lie algebras and corresponding discrete mappings are considered in section 7 .",
    "discrete versions of the oriented associativity equation are discussed in section 8 .",
    "discrete deformations of algebras for which the product of only distinct elements of the basis is defined are studied in section 9 .",
    "deformations of the three - dimensional algebras of such type , menelaus configurations and deformations are considered in section 10 . in section 11",
    "the kp configurations , discrete kp deformations and their gauge equivalence to the menelaus configurations and deformations are analyzed .",
    "section 12 is devoted to the multidimensional extensions of the menelaus and kp configurations and deformations .",
    "deformations governed by the discrete darboux system and discrete bkp hirota - miwa equation are considered in section 13 .",
    "associative algebras show up in various branches of the theory of integrable continuous and discrete systems .",
    "one of the simplest and , probably , algebraically the most transparent way to establish a connection between the continuous and discrete integrable equations and to reveal a possible role of associative algebras in their constructions is provided by backlund and darboux transformations .",
    "backlund transformations ( bts ) and darboux transformations ( dts ) are the discrete transformations ( depending on parameters ) which act on the variety of solutions of given integrable pde ( see e.g. [ 52,53 ] ) .",
    "they commute and , as the consequence , one has the algebraic relations between several solutions of the original pde which are usually refered as the nonlinear superposition formulae ( nsf ) . due to the commutativity",
    "one can treat bts and dts as the shifts on the lattice and the corresponding nsf take the form of the discrete equation on this lattice ( see e.g. [ 54,34 ] ) .",
    "probably , the first demonstration of the efficiency of this scheme is associated with the sine - gordon equation    @xmath8    where @xmath9 etc . introduced and well studied within the classical differential geometry of surfaces in @xmath10",
    "( see e.g. [ 52,53 ] ) more than century ago , this equation has been recognized as integrable by the inverse scattering transform ( ist ) method in 1973 [ 55,56 ] .",
    "bt @xmath11 for the sine - gordon equation is defined by the relations [ 57,52,53 ]    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is an arbitrary parameter .",
    "bts ( 5 ) with different a commute @xmath14 .",
    "this leads to the following nsf    @xmath15    where @xmath16 .",
    "this pure algebraic relation between four solutions of  equation ( 4 ) is a very useful one .",
    "it has allowed to calculate all multisoliton solutions of the sine - gordon equation many years before the discovery of the ist method [ 58 ] .",
    "then , due to the commutativity of bts one can treat @xmath17and @xmath18 as the shifts @xmath19 and @xmath20 of the solution @xmath21 at fixed x and y : @xmath22 enumerating  the family of solutions of equation ( 4 ) obtained by all compositions of bts by two integers @xmath23 , @xmath24 such that @xmath25etc , one rewrites the nsf ( 6 ) in the form of the discrete equation    @xmath26    this equation represents the discretization of equation ( 4 ) .",
    "remarkably , it coincides ( up to some trivial redefinitions ) with the integrable discretization of the sine - gordon equation proposed by hirota in [ 33 ] within a completely different method .",
    "there are many examples of such type . for the celebrated kdv equation    @xmath27    the spatial part of bt @xmath28",
    "is given by [ 59 ]    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is a parameter .",
    "the corresponding nsf of term of the potential v defined by @xmath31 is [ 59 ]    @xmath32    interpreted as the discrete equation this nsf is exactly the discrete kdv equation    @xmath33    introduced in [ 36,37 ] within the direct linearization aprroach .",
    "this discrete kdv equation is the generating equation for the whole kdv hierarchy .    in the same manner one can construct the discrete modified kdv equation and discrete schwarzian kdv equation [ 36 - 38 ] .",
    "the latter one is [ 38 ]    @xmath34    where p and q are arbitrary real parameters .",
    "similar results are valid also for 1 + 1-dimensional integrable systems of pdes . for instance , for the akns hierarchy",
    "[ 60 ] the first member of which is the system    @xmath35    one has two elementary bts [ 61 ] ( spatial parts )    @xmath36    @xmath37    where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are arbitrary parameters .",
    "nsf for these bts consists of the following two equations [ 61 ]    @xmath40    again it represents the discrete integrable akns system ( 10 ) and generates the whole akns hierarchy . note that this nsf implies the discrete equation",
    "( @xmath41    @xmath42    algebraic nsfs for 1 + 1-dimensional integrable equations typically contain four solutions and consequently their discrete integrable versions usually are the four points relations on a lattice .    for 2 + 1-dimensional",
    "integrable pdes the situation is quite different . for instance , for the kp equation",
    "the analog of the nsf ( 8) contains derivatives and more bt connected solutions are required in order to get a pure algebraic nsf .",
    "we will consider here the kp equation and hierarchy as illustrative example .",
    "we will also use the technique based on dt to derive nsf ( see [ 48 ] ) .",
    "we start with the standard linear problem    @xmath43    and adjoint linear problem    @xmath44    for the kp hierarchy .",
    "standard dts are given by ( see e.g. [ 8 ] )    @xmath45    where @xmath46,@xmath47 are independent solutions of the problem ( 15 ) with the original potential u. subsequent action of two dts ( 17 ) with distinct @xmath46 is of the form    @xmath48    where    @xmath49",
    "dts commute : @xmath50 as the consequence , the elimination of @xmath51 and @xmath52 from the formulae ( 17 ) , ( 18 ) gives the algebraic nsf [ 62 ]    @xmath53    in a similar manner one obtains the nsf for the wavefunction @xmath54 of the adjoint problem ( 16 ) :    @xmath55    for binary dt [ 8 ] @xmath56 transforms as given in ( 17 ) and    @xmath57    where @xmath58 and the bilinear potential @xmath59 is defined by    @xmath60    for the potential @xmath61 the binary dts are of the form    @xmath62    where    @xmath63",
    "since @xmath64 @xmath65 the elimination of @xmath66 and @xmath67 from the above formulae gives rise to the following nsf    @xmath68    due to the commutativity of dts one can interpret their action as the shifts on the lattice @xmath69 etc and , consequently , the nsfs ( 20 ) , ( 21 ) and ( 26 ) represent the discrete equations on the lattice .",
    "all of them contain six points of the lattice in contrast to the 1 + 1-dimensional case . under the constraint @xmath70 equation ( 26 )",
    "is reduced to the discrete schwarzian kdv equation ( 9 ) [ 48 ] .",
    "discrete equations ( 20 ) , ( 21 ) , ( 26 ) are fundamental equations for the kp hierarchy .",
    "they generate the whole hierarchies .",
    "for instance , equation ( 26 ) is the generating equation for the schwarzian kp hierarchy .",
    "moreover it has a beautiful geometrical meaning in connection with the classical menelaus theorem [ 48 ] .",
    "discrete equations ( 20 ) , ( 21 ) , ( 26 ) have been derived in a different way in the papers [ 62 - 65 ] . in particular , in [ 64,65 ] it was shown that all the above equations arise as the compatibility conditions for the system    @xmath71    where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the miwa shifts of the kp times , i.e. @xmath74)=\\phi ( t_{1}+a_{i},t_{2}+\\frac{1}{2}% a_{i}^{2},t_{3}+\\frac{1}{3}a_{i}^{3}, ... ).$ ]    equations ( 20 ) , ( 21 ) , ( 26 ) are closely connected with one more discrete equation associated with the kp hierarchy , namely , with the famous bilinear hirota - miwa equation    @xmath75    for the @xmath76-function .",
    "solutions of equations ( 20),(21 ) , ( 26 ) are ratios of @xmath76-functions .",
    "the @xmath76- function is sort of homogeneous coordinates for the lattice defined by these discrete equations .",
    "one has discrete equations similar to equations ( 20 ) , ( 21 ) , ( 26 ) , ( 28 ) for multicomponent kp hierarchy , two - dimensional toda lattice ( 2dtl ) hierarchy and other hierarchies [ 64,65 ] .",
    "they also have a nice geometrical interpretation [ 49 - 51 ] .",
    "one of their common features is that all of them are six and more points relations on the lattice .",
    "the connection between bts and dts and discrete integrable equations helps us also to clarify algebraic structures behind them .",
    "the ist linearizes not only the nonlinear pdes integrable by the method , but also the action of bts and dts [ 66 - 68 ] .",
    "for instance , the action of the bt ( 7 ) which adds one soliton to the solution of the kdv equation in term of the reflection coefficient @xmath77 ( part of the inverse problem data ) is a very simple one    @xmath78    multiple action of bts  is then the multiplication by the rational function :    @xmath79    an action of bts for other integrable equations has a similar form ( see e.g. [ 66 - 68 ] ) .",
    "this property of bts is inherited in the certain constructions of discrete integrable equations [ 35 - 38,69,70 ] .",
    "for example , the method proposed in [ 36 - 38 ] is based on the integral equation    @xmath80    for the matrix - valued functions of the integers @xmath81 shift in the variable @xmath82 is generated by the multiplication of the measure @xmath83 by a simple rational function :    @xmath84    where @xmath85 are parameters .    within the @xmath86- dressing method based on the nonlocal @xmath87 problem [ 71 ]",
    "( see also [ 72 ] )    @xmath88    an action of bt on the @xmath86-data @xmath89 is given by the formula [ 73,74 ]    @xmath90    both the @xmath86- dressing method and the direct linearization aprroach allow us to construct wide classes of discrete integrable equations .",
    "in both these methods an action of multiple shifts on the corresponding data is represented by the multiplication by rational functions    @xmath91    the method of constructing discrete equations proposed in [ 35 ] uses , essentially , the same idea .",
    "family of rational functions provides us with several examples of associative algebras .",
    "one of them is the algebra of complex functions with simple poles in distinct points . in virtue of the identity    @xmath92    with @xmath93 where @xmath94 is a complex variable and @xmath95",
    "are arbitrary parameters the table of multiplication for the elements @xmath96 of the basis of this algebra is of the form    @xmath97    functions @xmath98 with multiple poles at the same point form an infinite - dimensional associative algebra with the multiplication table @xmath99 .",
    "a natural extension of this example to the polynomials @xmath100 provides us with the infinite - dimensional associative algebra with the multiplication table    @xmath101    where @xmath3 are certain constants ( structure constants ) . under the additional polynomial constraint @xmath102 the algebra ( 37 )",
    "becomes the n - dimensional associative algebra .",
    "associative algebras of the type ( 36 ) and ( 37 ) show up in the study of many integrable systems both continuous and discrete . within the methods mentioned above the ring of rational functions and associative algebras did not play a significant role .",
    "the relations of the type ( 36 ) , ( 37 ) have appeared only in certain intermediate calculations .    in a completely different contexts",
    "associative algebras have been used for construction of integrable systems in the papers [ 75 - 80 ] .",
    "for instance , in [ 80]they served basically to fix a domain of definition of dependent variables for odes .    in the rest of the paper we shall try to demonstrate that the simple associative algebras of the type ( 36 ) , ( 37 ) are intimately connected with integrable systems .",
    "the latter arise as the equations describing deformations of the structure constants for such associative algebras .",
    "here we will present basic elements of the approach to the deformations of structure constants for associative algebras proposed in [ 21 - 24 ] in a slightly modified form .",
    "so , we consider a finite - dimensional noncommutative algebra _ a _ with ( or without ) unite element @xmath103 .",
    "we will restrict overself to a class of algebras which possess a basis composed by pairwise commuting elements @xmath104 .",
    "the table of multiplication    @xmath105    defines the structure constants @xmath3 .",
    "the commutativity of the basis implies that @xmath3 @xmath106 . in the presence of the unite element one has @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the kroneker symbol .",
    "following the gerstenhaber s suggestion [ 3,4 ] we will treat the structure constants @xmath3 in a given basis as the objects to deform and will denote the deformation parameters by @xmath109 .",
    "in the construction of deformations we should first to specify a ",
    "deformed  version of the multiplication table ( 38 ) and then to require that this realization is selfconsistence and meaningful .",

    ". we will refer to the systems of equations ( 59 ) , ( 60 ) as the central systems ( css ) .",
    "there are at least two reasons to consider these subclasses of deformations .",
    "the first is that they are equivalent to the compatibility conditions of the linear systems    @xmath165    where @xmath166 is a common right divisor of zero for all @xmath121 .",
    "recall that non - zero elements a and b of an algebra are called left and right divisors of zero if ab=0 ( see e.g.[81 ] ) . within the interpretation of @xmath167 and @xmath116 as operators acting in a linear space _",
    "equations ( 61 ) become the following linear problems for integrable systems    @xmath168    where @xmath169 .",
    "so , one can refer to such deformations as integrable one .",
    "the second reason to study equations ( 59 ) , ( 60 ) is that they have a nice geometrical meaning .",
    "we begin this study with rewriting these equations in a compact form . introducing the operators @xmath170 and @xmath171 acting as    @xmath172    and    @xmath173    one gets the following form of the formulae ( 51 ) and ( 54 )    @xmath174    and    @xmath175    respectively . for @xmath176 ( 53 ) , ( 56 ) one gets    @xmath177    and    @xmath178    then , introducing the matrices @xmath179 and @xmath180 such that @xmath181 and ( @xmath182 , one rewrites equations ( 59 ) and ( 60 ) in the matrix form    @xmath183    and    @xmath184    note that equation ( 70 ) is equivalent to the equation    @xmath185    which is of the form ( 69 ) for the matrix @xmath186 .",
    "one observes this similarity also for the operators @xmath170 and @xmath171 which in the matrix notations act as follows    @xmath187    for constant structure constants css ( 69 ) , ( 60 ) are reduced to the associativity condition ( 3 ) , i.e. @xmath188 = 0 $ ] . in general , for deformed @xmath126 this condition is not satisfied .",

    "it is nothing but the celebrated menelaus configuration of the classical geometry ( figure 1 ) ( see e.g. [ 90 ] , [ 91 ] ) . due to",
    "( 174 ) the relations ( 173 ) and menelaus configuration are translationally invariant .",
    "the relations ( 173 ) and ( 174 ) allow us to express a , b, ... ,g in terms of @xmath403 .",
    "one gets    @xmath404    where we denote by @xmath405 solution of the system ( 173 ) , ( 174 ) . in such a parametrization of a , b, ... ,g the relations ( 177 ) , ( 178 ) are equivalent to the single equation    @xmath406    it is the famous menelaus relation ( see [ 90 ] , [ 91 ] ) which guarantees that for any three points @xmath407 on the plane the points @xmath408 are collinear . in our formulation",
    "the menelaus relation ( 182 ) is nothing else than the associativity conditions ( 177 ) , ( 178 ) written in terms of @xmath405 .",
    "thus , the menelaus theorem is intimately connected with the associative algebra ( 163 ) , ( 165 ) with l = m = n=0 in the distinguished gauge ( 174 ) .",
    "amazingly , this interpretation seems to be not that distant from the old known algebraic proofs of the menelaus theorem where the relation of the type ( 177 ) already has appeared [ 90 ] .    comparing equations ( 182 ) and ( 26 )",
    ", one concludes that the menelaus relation and nsf for the schwarzian kp hierarchy coincide for given six points @xmath409 @xmath391 [ 48 ] . in the paper [ 48 ]",
    "this coincidence has been extended to the discrete equation thus defining the menelaus lattice .    in our approach discrete deformations of the algebra ( 163)-(166 ) and ,",
    "hence , of the menelaus configuration is governed by the cs    @xmath410    @xmath411    @xmath412    @xmath413    equations ( 184 ) , ( 185 ) imply that    @xmath414    which is equivalent to the relation ( 177 ) in virtue of the second equation ( 183 ) .",
    "thus , the menelaus relation ( 182 ) is preserved by deformations .",
    "discrete deformations of the menelaus configuration given by equations ( 183)-(186 ) generate a lattice on the plane .",
    "it is a straighforward check that equations ( 183)-(186 ) rewritten in terms of the  shape  parameters @xmath415 coincide with those derived in [ 48 ] ( theorem 3 ) .",
    "thus , the menelaus lattice represents a realization of discrete deformations of the associative algebra ( 163)-(165 ) with l = m = n=0 in the gauge ( 174 ) .    in [ 48 ]",
    "it was shown that under the constraint @xmath70 the menelaus relation ( 182 ) is reduced to the schwarzian discrete kdv equation ( 9 ) .",
    "so , the under this constraint one has a subclass of deformations governed by the discrete kdv equation ( 9 ) .",
    "there is an another distinguished gauge on the orbits under consideration .",
    "it is given by the relations    @xmath416    for which equations ( 173 ) take the form    @xmath417    we shall refer to this gauge as the kp gauge for the reason which will be clarified below . in this gauge the relation ( 177 ) becomes a trivial identity and , hence , the associativity conditions are reduced to the single equation    @xmath418    * proposition 4 . * in the kp gauge ( 187 ) the cs ( 183)- ( 186 ) is equivalent to the associativity condition ( 189 ) and equations    @xmath419    proof . in the gauge ( 187 )",
    "equations ( 183 ) are reduced to equations ( 190 ) while equations ( 184)- ( 186 ) are equivalent to the single equation @xmath420 .",
    "due to ( 190 ) this equation is equivalent to the associativity condition(189).@xmath421    equations ( 190 ) imply the existence of a function @xmath76 such that    @xmath422    substitution of these expressions into ( 189 ) gives the hirota bilinear equation for the kp hierarchy , i.e.    @xmath423    this fact justifies the name of the gauge ( 187 ) .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the hirota - miwa equation ( 192 ) is nothing but the associativity condition ( 189 ) with the structure constants a , c , e parametrized by @xmath76-function .",
    "equations ( 188 ) with a , c , e of the form ( 191 ) coincide with well - known linear problems for the hirota - miwa bilinear equation [ 92,35 ] .",
    "the parametrization ( 191 ) suggests to rewrite equation ( 188 ) in the gauge equivalent form    @xmath424    where @xmath425 .",
    "the condition of compatibility for the system ( 193 ) is equivalent to equation ( 192 ) too .",
    "equations ( 193 ) imply also that    @xmath426    that coincides with equation ( 192 ) .",
    "so , one can choose @xmath427 where @xmath428 is a solution of the hirota - miwa equation ( 192 ) .",
    "thus , one has    @xmath429    which is again  the well - known formula from the theory of the kp hierarchy .",
    "geometrical configuration on the plane formed by six points @xmath430 @xmath431 with real a , c , e is of interest too .",
    "we , first , observe that the points @xmath432 lie on the straight lines passing through the origin 0 and parallel to the straight lines passing through the points ( @xmath433 @xmath434 , respectively .",
    "then , due to the associativity condition ( 189 ) the points @xmath435 are collinear .",
    "indeed , equations ( 188 ) imply that    @xmath436    while the relation ( 189 ) is equivalent to the condition @xmath437thus , the points @xmath438 @xmath432 form the kp configuration on the complex plane shown on the figure 2 .",
    "configuration.,width=453 ]    the associativity condition ( 189 ) provides us also with the relation between the directed lengths for the kp configuration . indeed , expressing a , c , e from ( 188 ) in terms of @xmath439 and substituting into ( 189 ) , one gets    @xmath440    since for real a , c , e @xmath441 etc the formula ( 197 ) represents the relation between the directed lengths @xmath442 of the interval @xmath443 etc .",
    "in contrast to the menelaus case the relations ( 188 ) , ( 197 ) and kp configuration are not invariant with respect to the displacements on the plane .",
    "the menelaus and kp configurations look quite different .",
    "for instance , the points @xmath444 etc are collinear in the menelaus case and they are not in the kp case . nevertheless ,",
    "they are closely connected , namely , they are gauge equivalent to each other . to demonstrate this let us consider the gauge transformation @xmath445 . under this transformation    @xmath446    and    @xmath447    choosing @xmath448 where @xmath449 is a solution of equations ( 188 ) with the same @xmath450 , one gets    @xmath451    thus , @xmath452 and so the kp configuration is converted into the menelaus configuration . in geometric terms",
    "this gauge transformation is the local ( depending on the point ) homothetic transformation .",
    "so , in order to construct the menelaus configuration out of the kp we need two kp configurations with the same a , c , e. similarly , the formula ( 195 ) shows us that to construct kp configuration one needs two configurations of six points defined by the hirota - miwa equation ( 192 ) .",
    "another way to demonstrate the gauge equivalence between menelaus and kp configurations is based on the formula ( 27 ) .",
    "eliminating @xmath453 , one can rewrite this equation as [ 65 ]    @xmath454    where @xmath455 these equations imply the following    @xmath456    thus , @xmath457 and the formulae ( 201 ) give us the parametrization of a , b , ... ,",
    "g in terms of @xmath166 in the menelaus gauge .    performing the gauge transformation @xmath458 ,",
    "one gets the equations    @xmath459    so , @xmath460 and the formulae ( 202 ) provide us with the parametrization of a , b , ... ,",
    "g in the kp case in terms of @xmath166 .",
    "it is an easy check that the ratio @xmath461 of two solutions of the system ( 202 ) obeys the menelaus system ( 201 ) with @xmath462 in agreement with the formula @xmath463 .",
    "then , using parametrization of @xmath464 and @xmath465 given by the formulae ( 201 ) and ( 202 ) , it is not difficult to show that the invariants @xmath466 ( 159 ) are equal in menelaus and kp gauges .",
    "note also that in the parametrization ( 201 ) of the menelaus a , b, ... ,g the associativity conditions ( 177 ) , ( 178 ) are satisfied identically . in the kp case",
    "( 202 ) these associativity conditions are satisfied in virtue of equation ( 197 ) for @xmath467 .",
    "the collinearity conditions for points @xmath408 are obviously satisfied in both cases in parametrizations ( 201 ) and ( 202 ) .    at last ,",
    "the menelaus figure 1 and kp figure 2 are converted to each other by the gauge transformation ( local homothety ) @xmath468",
    "now let us consider the n - dimensional algebra ( 150 ) with @xmath469 in the menelaus gauge @xmath470 the associativity conditions in this case take the form    @xmath471    where all indices are distinct .",
    "multiplying the first of these equations by @xmath472 , second by @xmath473 and subtracting , one gets    @xmath474    with all distinct indices .    for n=3",
    "it is just the menelaus relation ( 177 ) . for arbitrary",
    "n the above menelaus type relations imply    @xmath475    from equations ( 157 ) with @xmath469 in the menelaus gauge one gets    @xmath476    substituting these expressions into ( 205 ) , one obtains the relation    @xmath477    it is the generalization of the menelaus relation to n - gons on the plane where @xmath478 are vertices of the n - gon and @xmath479 are points of intersections of a straight line with the corresponding sides of n - gon [ 93 ] ( see also [ 50 ] ) .",
    "again it is just the associativity condition ( 204 ) .",
    "deformations of the n - dimensional algebra ( 150 ) and n - gon menelaus configuration are governed by the cs    @xmath480    with all distinct indices j , k , l .    in the kp gauge",
    "@xmath481 the associativity conditions for the n - dimensional algebra ( 150 ) with @xmath469 are reduced to the system    @xmath482    with distinct indices j , k ,",
    "l . associated",
    "geometrical configurations on the plane are of interest too .",
    "for example , at n=4 one has four connected kp configuations of the type shown in the figure 2 . for the triples of points @xmath483 @xmath484 one has four triples @xmath485 of collinear points .",
    "the latter form the classical menelaus configuration ( figure 1 ) .",
    "deformations of such multi - kp configurations are governed by the cs    @xmath486    @xmath487    similar to the case n=3 this system is equivalent to the associativity condition ( 209 ) and equation ( 210 ) .",
    "equations ( 210 ) imply the existence of the function @xmath76 such that    @xmath488    substitution of this expression into ( 209 ) gives    @xmath489    with the distinct indices j , k , l .",
    "this is the multi - dimensional version of the hirota - miwa equation ( 192 ) .",
    "one has also the multi - dimensional versions of the relations ( 197 ) , parametrizations of @xmath490 and @xmath465 given by ( 201 ) and ( 202 ) as well as the gauge equivalence between the multi - menelaus and multi - kp configurations .",
    "now we will turn back to the algebra ( 150 ) with unite element .",
    "the table of multiplication for the three - dimensional irreducible subalgebra is given by ( 163)- ( 165 ) and the distinguished gauge is defined by relations ( 170)- ( 172 ) .",
    "geometrically the triples of structure constants ( a , b , l ) , ( c , d , m ) , ( e , g , n ) are the barycentric ( or normalized ) cooordinates of the points @xmath408 in the plane of the given triangles with the vertices in points @xmath491 @xmath492 , respectively .",
    "discrete darboux system ( 217 ) is an important system in discrete geometry , in particular , in the theory of quadrilateral lattices ( see e.g. [ 94 ] , [ 95 ] ) .",
    "the above result shows that the theory of quadrilateral lattices and discrete deformations of the algebras ( 150 ) are strongly interconnected .",
    "this connection provides us with some new interpretations of notions used in discrete geometry .",
    "for instance , the notion of consistency around the cube discussed in [ 70,96 ] is strickly related to the condition of associativity @xmath500 for the three - dimensional algebra of the type ( 150 ) .",
    "multi - dimensional consistency ( see e.g. [ 43 ] ) is the associativity condition ( 152 ) , i.e.        discrete darboux system ( 217 ) governs deformations of generic structure constants for the algebra ( 150 ) modulo gauge transformations .",
    "deformations of the constrained structure constants are of interest too .",
    "one of the examples is provided by the deformations of the three - dimensional algebra ( 163)- ( 165 ) with the additional constraint                    this equation is the hirota - miwa bilinear discrete equation for the kp hierarchy of b type ( bkp hierarchy ) [ 92 ] .",
    "so , the hirota - miwa equation ( 226 ) together with the formulae ( 191 ) describe discrete deformations of the algebra ( 163)- ( 165 ) under the constraints ( 222 ) , ( 223 ) .",
    "in contrast to the kp case these deformations are not isoassociative .                this is the nsf for the schwarzian bkp hierarchy [ 98 ] . geometrically",
    "this 8-points relation has the meaning of the characteristic equation for two reciprocal triangles on the plane [ 49 ] .",
    "considered as the discrete equation it defines a lattice on the plane consisting of reciprocal triangles . for more details including connection with the works of j. c. maxwell see [ 49 ] .",
    "finally , we note that the bkp lattice is gauge equivalent to a particular darboux lattice . indeed , performing the gauge transformation @xmath510 in equations ( 227 ) with @xmath511 where @xmath366 is a solution of ( 227 ) ,",
    "one obtains the system of linear equations for @xmath512 with coefficients obeying the relations ( 170 ) , ( 172 ) .",
    "the menelaus lattice is , obviously , the reduction of the darboux lattice with l = m = n=0 .",
    "thus , the discrete darboux system ( 217 ) plays the central role in the theory of discrete deformations of the algebras of the type ( 150 ) .
