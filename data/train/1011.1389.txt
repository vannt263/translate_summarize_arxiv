    "non - compact non - linear sigma models are an important and extensively used tool in the study of disordered electron systems .",
    "the relevant formalism was pioneered by wegner @xcite , schfer & wegner @xcite , and pruisken & schfer @xcite .",
    "efetov @xcite improved the formalism by developing the supersymmetry method to derive non - linear sigma models .",
    "many applications of the supersymmetry method can be found in the textbook by efetov @xcite .",
    "there exist different ways to derive non - linear sigma models from microscopic models ; for an introduction see @xcite .",
    "one step in the traditional approach uses a hubbard - stratonovich transformation , i.e. , a transformation of the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 and the domain of integration d is left unspecified for now .",
    "@xmath4 denotes lebesgue measure of a normed vector space .    for the case of compact symmetries",
    "the transformation is just a trivial gaussian integral . to give an indication of the difficulty which arises in the case of a non - compact symmetry ( also known as the boson - boson sector of efetov s supersymmetry formalism )",
    "let us briefly discuss the example of orthogonal symmetry @xmath1 .",
    "there , @xmath5 is given by @xmath6 with @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the @xmath9 represent the microscopic degrees of freedom .",
    "using equation and integrating out @xmath10 gives a description in terms of the effective degrees of freedom @xmath11 .",
    "the task is to find a domain of integration d for which identity holds and the term @xmath12 stays bounded .",
    "the latter condition is imposed in order for fubini s theorem to apply , as further execution of the wegner - efetov formalism calls for the @xmath10 and @xmath11 integrals to be interchanged .",
    "note that the real matrices @xmath5 obey the symmetry relation @xmath13 . a naive choice of integration domain d keeping the term @xmath12 bounded would be the domain of all real matrices satisfying @xmath14 .",
    "unfortunately , this choice of d is not a valid choice in the context of the integral as it renders the quadratic form @xmath15 of indefinite sign .",
    "schfer and wegner ( sw ) @xcite suggested a domain and showed that it solves the difficulty .",
    "yet , a different domain was proposed in later work by pruisken and schfer ( ps ) @xcite . until recently the mathematical status of identity for the ps domain was unclear .",
    "the main obstacle in proving for the ps domain is the existence of a boundary .",
    "this precludes an easy proof by completing the square and shifting the contour ( as is possible for the standard gauss integral and for the sw domain ) .",
    "nevertheless , the ps domain was used in most applications worked out by the mesoscopic and disordered physics community ; an early and influential paper of this kind is @xcite .",
    "most likely , the reason is that it is easier to do calculations with , as it is invariant under the full symmetry group of the domain of matrices @xmath5 .",
    "recently fyodorov , wei and zirnbauer in a series of papers @xcite proved the ps variant of the hs transformation for the special cases of unitary and orthogonal symmetry . in this article",
    "we extend the results to more general symmetry groups .",
    "moreover , our proof clarifies the relation between the ps transformation , the sw transformation and the standard gaussian integrals .",
    "it is shown that the different integrals can be transformed into each other by deforming the domain of integration without changing the value of the integral .",
    "here is a guide to reading : in section [ results ] we define the setting and state our main result in the form of a theorem .",
    "in addition , we give two corollaries which relate more directly to previous results . in section [ examples ] we apply our results to three different symmetry classes . in particular ,",
    "previous results concerning the cases of unitary and orthogonal symmetry are reproduced .",
    "the proof of the theorem is contained in section [ proof ] , which is divided into three subsections .",
    "for the convenience of the reader each subsection is preceded by a short introduction of notation , essential structures , and a lemma containing the results of the pertinent part of the proof .",

    "in addition to the involutions of the unitary setting we need an involution @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "the additional presence of this involution requires all matrices to be real . in consequence ,",

    "in the proof we use some standard results of lie theory , all of which can be found in the literature , e.g. in @xcite . since @xmath31 is closed under hermitian conjugation ( @xmath126 ) we know that @xmath31 is reductive , i.e.  the direct sum of an abelian and a semisimple lie algebra . for simplicity we first restrict ourselves to the case where @xmath31 is semisimple .",
    "the extension to the reductive case will be straightforward .",
    "the proof of the theorem is divided into three parts .",
    "the first part , in section [ ps_domain ] , contains the derivation of a new parametrization of the ps domain , which makes it possible to deal with its boundary . the second part , in [ ext_ps ] ,",
    "is concerned with the extension of the ps domain to a domain without boundary .",
    "first we identify good directions into which to extend the ps domain .",
    "then we give an extension of ps which does not change the value of the integral .",
    "although much of it is unnecessary for the formal proof , section [ ext_ps ] is an important prerequisite to understanding the third part , [ equiv_ps_euclid ] , where we give a homotopy @xmath127 connecting the extended ps domain to the euclidean domain .",
    "the main point is to make rigorous the following schematic application of stokes theorem : @xmath128 where we have introduced @xmath129 .",
    "the first term on the right hand side is identically zero because @xmath130 is holomorphic in @xmath11 . in the final subsection [ sect:4.4 ]",
    "we deduce the corollaries [ cor_2_1 ] and [ cor_2_2 ] .    at this point",
    "a warning is in order . in the given form",
    "the expressions above do not make sense . in order for the integrals over @xmath53 and @xmath127 to exist",
    "we have to include some regularization .",
    "this delicate issue is discussed in detail in the last part of subsection [ equiv_ps_euclid ] .",
    "that discussion also entails that the extension of @xmath53 does not contribute to the left hand side of the equation .",
    "we now invest some effort in order to derive a parametrization of the domain of integration which gives full control over its boundary . to guide the reader , we first define and explain all objects that are necessary to formulate a lemma stating the parametrization .",
    "in order to evaluate @xmath131 in explicitly , we need to compute multiple commutators of @xmath132 with @xmath133 .",
    "therefore we now choose a maximal abelian subalgebra @xmath134 in @xmath39 and diagonalize the commutator action of @xmath134 on @xmath33 .",
    "this diagonalization process gives rise to a root space decomposition @xmath135 where @xmath136 denotes a set of positive roots .",
    "each root space in turn is decomposed into a hermitian ( @xmath38 ) and an antihermitian ( @xmath40 ) part : @xmath137 we also let @xmath138 .",
    "hence we have the decompositions @xmath139 for future reference we observe that @xmath140 , \\label{ad_s_isom}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is an isomorphism .",
    "this fact will be used several times in the proof .    for the following constructions we review the notion of pointed polyhedral cone and triangulations thereof @xcite .",
    "a pointed polyhedral cone is a subset of a vector space . by definition",
    "it is an intersection of finitely many half spaces where the intersection of all hyperplanes bounding the half spaces contains only the zero vector .",
    "the word pointed reflects the fact that there exists a hyperplane which intersects the cone only at zero , with the rest of the cone lying strictly on one side of that hyperplane .",
    "for example , if @xmath141 denotes a system of positive roots for the adjoint action of @xmath134 on @xmath31 , the positive weyl chamber @xmath142 is a pointed polyhedral cone . in the following we refer to a pointed polyhedral cone as a cone for short .",
    "let @xmath143 be a vector space of codimension one such that @xmath144 lies entirely on one side of @xmath145 .",
    "a face of @xmath144 is a set of the form @xmath146 .",
    "the zero vector is the unique zero dimensional face .",
    "it is convenient also to include the empty set as a face .",
    "the one dimensional faces are called edges .",
    "note that each nontrivial face is again a cone .",
    "it is a fact @xcite that any cone @xmath144 admits a different representation : there exist @xmath147 elements @xmath148 such that @xmath149 the @xmath150 are called generators of the cone . they can be chosen in such a way that each @xmath150 generates an edge of the cone . in the case of a positive weyl chamber @xmath144 a set of generators",
    "is furnished by the simple co - roots .",
    "a cone is called simplicial if its generators are linearly independent .",
    "a @xmath151-cone is a cone of dimension @xmath151 .",
    "it is a known fact of lie theory that @xmath144 is a simplicial @xmath152-cone .",
    "a finite collection @xmath153 of @xmath154-cones is called a subdivision of @xmath144 if @xmath155 and @xmath156 is a face of both @xmath157 and @xmath158 for all @xmath159 .",
    "if each cone in a subdivision @xmath153 is simplicial , then @xmath153 is called a triangulation .",
    "bearing these facts in mind we proceed to describe a decomposition of @xmath144 which , as we shall see below , is directly related to the boundary of the ps domain .",
    "note , first of all , that a root @xmath160 may change sign on @xmath144 since @xmath144 is defined with respect to the root system @xmath141 .",
    "the closures of the connected components of @xmath161 can be obtained as appropriate intersections of half spaces and hence are again cones .",
    "let @xmath162 denote the collection of generators of these cones [ the cardinality @xmath163 exceeds @xmath147 if @xmath164 . by construction",
    "the intersection of two such cones is a face common to both . put differently ,",
    "the generators common to two such cones generate a joint face .",
    "thus the decomposition we have just described yields a subdivision of @xmath144 . it is a fact @xcite that every subdivision of a cone can be refined to a triangulation without introducing any new generators .    for the rest of the article we fix a triangulation @xmath165 which refines the subdivision of @xmath144 described above .",
    "let @xmath166 be such that @xmath167 is the set of generators for the simplicial cone indexed by @xmath168 , i.e. , let @xmath169 note that @xmath170 and that the generators @xmath167 form a basis of @xmath134 .",
    "the latter fact implies that each @xmath171 is represented uniquely as @xmath172 with coefficients @xmath173 .",
    "the intersection @xmath174 of two simplicial cones is again a simplicial cone ; indeed , the set of generators of the latter is @xmath175 .",
    "a key property of the decomposition is that the sign of each @xmath176 stays constant on any given simplicial cone @xmath177 .",
