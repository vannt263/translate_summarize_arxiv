    "as one of the most remarkable discoveries from the yohkoh mission @xcite , the flare occurring on 1992 january 13 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* the  masuda flare  ) revealed for the first time a bright hard x - ray source in the corona , simultaneously with conjugate footpoint sources , which helped shape the modern vision of solar flares .",
    "most importantly , it has corroborated the paradigm , long conjectured by theorists , that particles are accelerated high in the corona and stream down to the chromosphere along a coronal magnetic loop ( see the review by * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . in spite of accumulating observations of hard x - ray coronal emission since then , the original masuda flare has remained unique , as reviewed by @xcite , in that ( a ) the hard x - ray coronal source is located about 7000 km ( @xmath410@xmath5 ) above the _ apex _ of the soft x - ray loop ; and that ( b ) the hard x - ray coronal source is surprisingly weak in the 1423 kev range .",
    "its spectrum is therefore extremely flattened below @xmath420 kev , excluding a plausible thermal interpretation @xcite .",
    "these features , however , are in contrast to the coronal sources reported later on ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the survey on partially occulted flares observed by rhessi @xcite , in which the footpoints are occulted by the limb but the thermal loop is visible , show that most hard x - ray coronal emission during the flare impulsive phase is only slightly above ( @xmath6 ) the thermal loop , with many filled - loop events even displaying co - spatial non - thermal emission , and that the power - law index is between 4 and 7 , much softer than that of comparable on - disk flares .    on the other hand ,",
    "although the masuda source has been described as being distinctly above the loop top , more recently , `` above - the - loop - top '' sources have been primarily , if not exclusively , found in a double coronal source morphology @xcite : the lower coronal source is located at the thermal loop top , while the upper source is located as far as @xmath7 above it , moving upward at a speed as high as 300 km s@xmath8 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the two sources `` mirror '' each other with respect to a presumed x - point reconnection site , in that higher energy emission comes from lower altitudes for the upper source , while the lower source exhibits a reversed order ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this morphology is obviously different from that of the masuda flare .",
    "meanwhile , @xcite accurately estimated the instrumental response functions through self - calibration using solar flares as calibration sources , and improved the maximum entropy method ( mem ) image - synthesis algorithm .",
    "accordingly , the hxt images of the masuda flare display somewhat subtle but significant changes , as compared with the pre - calibration publications ( see section 2 )",
    ". the spectral characteristics of the coronal source , as reported in the post - calibration investigations using the mem algorithm , also change substantially ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* also see section 3 )",
    ". however , a mind - set has been developed , and these new developments are unfortunately left unaddressed or unnoticed in the solar community .",
    "intending to resolve these inconsistencies in the literature , we re - analyze the masuda flare with both mem and pixon @xcite algorithms in this paper . in section 2",
    ", we check the changes of the hard x - ray source locations , as compared with the original data .",
    "in section 3 , we review the historical investigations and interpretations (  3.1 ) , and then redo the imaging spectroscopic analysis (  3.2 ) . in section 4",
    ", we discuss the significance of the geometrical changes (  4.1 ) , interpret the spectral results from both the thermal (  4.2 ) and non - thermal (  4.3 ) viewpoints , and a simplified picture is proposed to explain the morphological , as well as spectral , evolution of the coronal source (  4.3 ) .",

    "the hard x - ray emission occurs in the impulsive phase and consists of a single peak that lasts for about 2 min .",
    "three time intervals are chosen for image reconstruction , namely , 17:26:5017:27:35 ut ( slow rise phase ) , 17:27:3517:28:15 ut ( fast rise phase ) , and 17:18:1517:29:00 ( decay phase ) , which are marked by dotted lines .",
    "the hard x - ray telescope ( hxt ) provides four energy channels , l ( 1423 kev ) , m1 ( 2333 kev ) , m2 ( 3353 kev ) and h ( 5393 kev ) .",
    "the coronal source is visible preferentially in the m1- and m2-band .",
    "hxt images in the lower three channels are shown in figure  [ img ] as contours in the same color code as in the bottom panel of figure  [ lcur ] .",
    "soft x - ray images obtained by the soft x - ray telescope ( sxt ) are displayed in grey colors .",
    "the three columns in figure  [ img ] correspond to the three time intervals indicated in figure  [ lcur ] .",
    "images in the top ( bottom ) row are reconstructed with the mem ( pixon ) algorithm .",
    "one can immediately see in figure  [ img ] that the l - band loop is different in shape from the original one ( cf .",
    "* ) , and that the hard x - ray coronal source ( m1- and m2-bands ) , located only slightly above the sxt loop , is generally enclosed by the l - band loop at 1020% brightness contour levels .",
    "in contrast , in the original mem image ( e.g. , left panel of figure 3 in @xcite ) , the hard x - ray coronal source was spatially distinct not only from the sxt loop , but from the l - band loop as well .",
    "further comparisons are made quantitatively . in a similar approach taken by @xcite",
    ", we measure the centroid position of the loop - top source , and compute its height , in each hxt energy band ( except the h - band ) , with respect to the conjugate footpoints in the m1-band . for sxt , following @xcite , the brightness maximum at the enhanced loop top is pinpointed , for which the measurement error is estimated to be half of the sxt ccd pixel size ( @xmath10 , or @xmath41750 km ) . to compare with the result given by @xcite that the m1-band coronal source was above the apex of the sxt loop by @xmath47000 km",
    ", we draw a line connecting the midpoint of the m1-band footpoints and the brightness maximum of the sxt loop , and choose the pixel where the line intersects the sxt 30% brightness contour ( see figure  [ err ] ) as a conservative proxy for the loop apex .    to estimate the uncertainties of the hard x - ray source locations , we simulate the hxt images by adding random noise to the data counts collected by each of the 64 subcollimators , @xmath11 , i.e. , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a pseudo - random number generated by the idl procedure ` randomn ` .",
    "a new image can be reconstructed based on @xmath14 and the source centroids are measured . in practice ,",
    "a box is specified to enclose each individual source in an image .",
    "a region is allowed to grow from the local maximum inside each box to include all connected neighbors whose values are above a given minimum ( see the ` region_grow ` function in idl ) , which is chosen interactively so that the region takes the shape of an ellipse .",
    "the centroid position is determined by fitting a 2d elliptical gaussian equation to each individual region . by repeating the above procedure for many times ( 30 times in our work )",
    ", we get a distribution of the source centroids , and their uncertainties can be approximated by standard deviation .",
    "the flux uncertainty of each individual source as shown in figure  [ img ] can also be obtained from the simulated images ( see table  [ tbl - f ] ) by integrating the flux inside a box region containing the source .    for the pixon algorithm , alternatively , an error map ( 1-@xmath15 error at each pixel ) can be obtained for the reconstructed image .",
    "thus , we can estimate the uncertainties of the source centroids by adding ( substracting ) the error map to ( from ) the reconstructed pixon map , getting the `` new '' source locations , and then comparing with those obtained from the pixon map alone .",
    "the larger of the differences is taken as the error bar .    in figure",
    "[ err ] , we show the source centroids during the fast rise phase ( 17:27:3517:28:15 ut ) , with corresponding error bars estimated from simulated mem ( left panel ) and pixon ( middle panel ) images , as well as from pixon error maps ( right panel ) . sources in different hxt energy bands are represented with the same color code as in figure  [ lcur ] .",
    "the brightness maximum of the sxt loop top is shown in orange , and its apex is denoted by an asterisk .",
    "one can see that the accuracy of the hxt loop - top centroid position is comparable to that of the brightest sxt pixel , despite that the fwhm of the finest hxt collimator is as large as 6000 km .",
    "the footpoint positions are even more accurate , with sub - arcsec precision being achieved .",
    "various geometrical parameters can then be derived and their error bars are computed following the rules of the propagation of uncertainty @xcite , less than the error of locating the brightest sxt pixel ( @xmath4900 km ) . ] .",
    "the results are listed in table  [ tbl - geometry ] . for comparison ,",
    "corresponding numbers given by @xcite and @xcite are also listed in bold and slanted face , respectively .",
    "one obvious difference is the smaller separation of m1-band coronal source from the brightness maximum of the sxt loop .",
    "the height difference , @xmath16 in table  [ tbl - geometry ] ( @xmath17 km in pixon and @xmath18 km in mem ) , is almost half of that measured by ( * ? ? ?",
    "the height difference between the m1-band coronal source and the apex of the sxt loop , @xmath19 in table  [ tbl - geometry ] ( @xmath20 km in pixon and @xmath21 km in mem ) , is also much smaller than that given by @xcite .",
    "the new measurement is in agreement with rhessi observations @xcite that typical impulsive phase coronal emission is only slightly above the thermal loop ( @xmath6 ) , which , however , is measured by the radial difference of the center of mass locations .",
    "this is slightly different from the approach taken by @xcite and this paper .",
    "accordingly , the m1-band coronal source is also less separated from the l - band loop top in terms of centroid positions .",
    "thus , any reasonably chosen integration region containing the m1-band source in imaging spectroscopic analysis will inevitably include much more l - band photon counts than it would with the original hxt images , therefore leading to a much larger l- and m1-band ratio , as we shall demonstrate in section 3 .",

    "different decisions made by data analyzers in the same era , e.g. , different integration region and time interval for data accumulation , appear to result in only minimal differences , however .    in the pre - calibration era , the verdict for the masuda flare is that the coronal emission was nonthermal ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the thermal interpretation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) was largely rejected due to the following three major arguments : ( a ) the thermal bremsstrahlung requires an extremely hot plasma ( up to @xmath27 mk ) , for which there was no evidence from other instruments , e.g. the impulsive phase bcs spectra , assumed from the loop top , give a source temperature of @xmath28 mk @xcite ; ( b ) the temperature derived from the hxt lower channels is much higher ( @xmath29 mk ) than that from the higher channels ( 125@xmath915 mk ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; and ( c ) the time variability of the coronal source was too rapid ( similar to that of the footpoints ) to be consistent with thermal cooling times @xcite .",
    "we will check these arguments against the re - calibrated data in  4.2 .    on the other hand",
    ", it is very difficult to understand the extremely hard spectrum of the coronal source , which had a power - law index of @xmath42 from the l- and m1-band ratio . though it may indicate a possible turnover in a nonthermal electron spectrum , such a flat spectral index is close to the hardest theoretically possible bremsstrahlung spectrum",
    "nevertheless , putting in the perspective of the thick - thin target model @xcite , which argues that a coronal source acts as a thick target ( @xmath30 ) for electrons at lower energies and thin target ( @xmath31 ) for higher energies , one can derive that the spectral index of the injecting electrons for the coronal source , @xmath32 , while that for the footpoint emission , @xmath33 .",
    "note , however , that the thick - thin target model assumes that the same electron population is responsible for both the coronal and the footpoint emission .",
    "a promising explanation is electron trapping in the corona , with energy losses dominated by collisions @xcite . since the collisional deflection time of an electron of energy @xmath34 , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the electron density and @xmath37 the coulomb logarithm ( @xmath38 under solar conditions ) , the longer life time of more energetic electrons would result in the erosion of the low - energy regime of the velocity distribution function , therefore the progressive spectral hardening , on timescales in the order of 10100 s for a coronal density of order @xmath39 @xmath40 .",
    "the coronal trapping of energetic electrons predicts that the injecting spectrum for the coronal source is hardening for 1.5 powers relative to the corresponding footpoint emission in the weak diffusion limit ( see  4.3 ) .",
    "it also leads to the progressive delay of hard x - ray peaks with increasing energy , due to collisional precipitation of the trapped electrons ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "based on time - of - flight measurements , @xcite found 5 hard x - ray coronal sources that can be explained by a coronal trap in the weak diffusion limit .",
    "the same 5 events were also studied by @xcite , who were looking for the spectral evidence of trapping .",
    "two of them , including the masuda flare , were found to be consistent with impulsive phase coronal trapping in the thick - thin target scenario .    in the post - calibration era",
    ", in contrast , the spectrum of the masuda loop - top source looks rather soft @xcite , with its spectral indices falling in the typical range of recent rhessi observations ( 47 ; * ? ? ?",
    "using the mem algorithm , @xcite reported that the loop - top spectrum can be well fit by emission from an isothermal plasma of about 100 mk . in ",
    "3.2 , we present a re - analysis of the masuda flare with both mem and pixon algorithms , and in section 4 , discuss the implications of the changes introduced by the re - calibration .",

    "there are three major difficulties in understanding the original masuda flare , viz .",
    ", 1 ) the lack of l - band emission at the coronal source and consequently the extremely flat spectrum of the coronal source below @xmath420 kev @xcite ; 2 ) the apparently low density at the location of the coronal source due to the lack of sxt emission ; and 3 ) the lack of soft x - ray signature of hydrodynamic response at the presumed field lines that connected the hard x - ray coronal source to the chromosphere @xcite . also , the soft x - ray loop barely grows with time , defying the theory of choromospheric evaporation .",
    "all three difficulties can be arguably attributed to the elevated hard x - ray coronal source in the original data .",
    "thus , the reduction of the source height relative to the soft x - ray loop in the re - calibrated data has more or less relieved these difficulties .",
    "we will discuss the 3rd difficulty in  4.3 .",
    "as for the first one , although the spectrum has become softer at lower energies with the re - calibrated data , the fact that the masuda source is poorly imaged in the l - band remains a puzzle .",
    "it might be due to a turnover in non - thermal electron spectrum , or to instrumental effects , or simply to the poor resolution of hxt .",
    "in any case , the l- and m1-band ratio reflects poorly the true spectral slope .",
    "the 2nd point deserves some further comments .",
    "the column depth required to stop electrons at 20 kev , the approximate break energy of the coronal spectrum , is @xmath70 @xmath71 , which can be estimated from the formula ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath72 where @xmath34 is in erg , n is in @xmath71 , and @xmath73 , with @xmath74 the electron charge ( @xmath75 esu ) .",
    "given a source length of @xmath76 cm , the density , @xmath36 , is as large as @xmath77 @xmath40 .",
    "this , however , agrees approximately with @xcite who found the electron density in the flare trap of the masuda flare , @xmath78 @xmath40 , by fitting the hard x - ray energy - dependent time delays with the electron collisional deflection time .",
    "the trap density is lower than the peak density in the sxt loop top , @xmath79 @xmath40@xcite , but at least an order of magnitude larger than the density at the original coronal source location , e.g. , @xmath80 @xmath40 , inferred from hxt data by @xcite , or @xmath81 @xmath40 , inferred from both hxt and sxt data by @xcite .",
    "hence the coronal trap must be located above the brightness maximum of the sxt loop , but lower in altitude than the original masuda source .",
    "if the trap location is consistent with the current source location , the condition for the confinement of nonthermal electrons at the loop - top region is much less stringent than that imposed by the original data .",
    "for example , a 20 kev electron needs to bounce only 5 times for the thick target hypothesis to be effective , in contrast to more than 30 times of bounce as required by the original data , given the column depth , @xmath82 @xmath71 @xcite .    in view of the argument above , the thick - thin target model proposed by @xcite",
    "looks quite promising .",
    "it is noteworthy that the sxt loop is clearly visible at the flare onset ( the bottom panel of figure  [ lcur ] ) , suggesting that the coronal atmosphere has already been heated to a dense and hot state prior to impulsive electron acceleration .",
    "if the corona is dense enough , it can stop the less energetic electrons to produce a bright , thick - target coronal source in the l - band , and a much dimmer , thin - target one in higher - energy bands .",
    "rhessi has observed coronal sources brighter than footpoints at energies up to 50 kev @xcite , which take the shape of a loop and are explained by the thick - target model .",
    "we will test the re - calibrated data against the thick - thin target model (  4.3 ) , but before that we first re - examine the thermal interpretation (  4.2 ) .      from table  [ tbl - m ]",
    ", one can see that a consistent temperature can be derived from two different hxt channel ratios ( l / m1 and m1/m2 ) , in contrast to previous publications @xcite . in table",
    "[ tbl - m2 ] , temperatures derived from the lower hxt channel ratio are indeed higher than those from the higher channel ratio during the fast rise phase , probably suggesting the existence of a nonthermal component , despite that the two temperatures still fall within the same error range .",
    "we now check another major argument against the thermal interpretation , viz .",
    ", the time variability of the coronal source is much shorter than the electron thermalization time for coulomb collisions @xcite , @xmath83 with @xmath84 @xmath40 ( assuming a unity filling factor ) and @xmath85 mk from @xcite , @xmath86 s. this number has been commonly cited in the literature , out of the context of specific plasma parameters . with @xmath87 @xmath40 estimated by @xcite and @xmath88 mk from our analysis , however , @xmath89 is about 1.4 s. if the trap density ( @xmath90 @xmath40 ) inferred by @xcite is adopted , @xmath89 could be as small as 0.2 s. thus , the thermal interpretation can not be ruled out unambiguously , based on the spectral information available .",
    "however , the temperature is still much higher than that derived from bcs spectra ( @xmath28 mk ; * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , a single thermal fit can be excluded for most hard x - ray coronal sources observed by rhessi @xcite .",
    "these observations cast doubt on the thermal interpretation of the masuda flare .",
    "following the thick - thin target model @xcite , we assume that the coronal source acts as a thick target for less energetic electrons ( @xmath91 ) , and a thin target for more energetic electrons ( @xmath92 ) . with low - energy electrons stopped in the loop - top region , the footpoint emission is not supposed to follow power laws at low energies , but a thick target is assumed at high energies as usual ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "the derived electron indices are given in table  [ tbl - tt ] , in which we only use the photon indices obtained by pixon .",
    "one should trust @xmath94 more than @xmath95 , since the latter is inevitably contaminated by thermal emission , especially for the integration region that covers both the m1- and m2-band emission .",
    "the thick - thin target model agrees well with the observation during the fast rise phase of the hard x - ray burst , when @xmath95 , @xmath94 , and @xmath96 are approximately equal to each other ( shown in bold face in table  [ tbl - tt ] ) . during the slow rise phase , however , @xmath94 is significantly smaller than @xmath96 .",
    "one difficulty in understanding the masuda flare ( see  4.1 ) lies in the lack of signature of choromospheric evaporation .",
    "this can be understood if the less energetic electrons , which constitute the bulk energy of injecting electrons , are mostly stopped in the dense corona , as indicated by the existence of the soft x - ray loop at the flare onset ( figure  [ lcur ] ) . in that case , chromospheric evaporation would be strongly suppressed , due not only to reduced energy deposited in the chromosphere , but also to enhanced inertia of the overlying material @xcite . moreover",
    ", the fact that the electrons interact with hot coronal plasma rather than a `` cold target '' reduces the energy - loss rate , hence fewer electrons are required at low energies , which helps to alleviate the electron number problem @xcite .      & m1 & m2 & 5.6@xmath97 & 4.0@xmath90.4 & 5.0@xmath90.2 + & m2 & 5.4@xmath90.3 & 3.8@xmath90.4 & 5.0@xmath90.2 + & m1 & m2 & 5.7@xmath90.2 & 4.8@xmath90.5 & 4.3@xmath90.1 + & m2 & * 4.4@xmath90.5 * & * 4.1@xmath90.5 * & * 4.3@xmath90.1 *    the spectral characteristics revealed in table  [ tbl - tt ] seem to put the coronal trap in the weak pitch angle diffusion regime , in which the loss cone is empty , while the opposite case , that the loss cone is filled with scattered particles , is defined as the strong diffusion .",
    "specifically , in a trap - and - precipitation scenario , the precipitation rate , @xmath98 , can be evaluated as , @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the loss - cone angle . if the data accumulation time is significantly longer than the trapping time ( @xmath101 ) , which is often the case , the observed injecting electron spectrum for the coronal source in relation to that for the corresponding footpoint emission would satisfy the following inequality ( c.f . ,",

    "the decrease in the additional hardening of @xmath103 relative to @xmath96 with time , as indicated in table  [ tbl - tt ] , may suggest an enhanced scattering rate .",
    "alternatively , this can be attributed to an interesting effect in the standard flare model , namely , _ field line shrinkage _ ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the cartoon in figure  [ cartoon ] shows that the magnetic field strength at the soft x - ray loop top would increase with time , as the newly reconnected , cusp - shaped field lines `` shrink '' and relax into a more potential state , piling up above the soft x - ray loop .",
    "as we know , the loss - cone angle , @xmath100 , is defined through the formula , @xmath104 where @xmath105 and @xmath106 are the magnetic field strength at the footpoint and at the coronal trap , respectively .",
    "the increase of the magnetic field strength at the coronal trap would result in the enlargement of the loss cone , and therefore the enhancement of the precipitation rate , if we assume that electrons are continuously injecting into the trap .",
    "electrons that are trapped before the field line shrinkage , however , would not be affected by the strengthening @xmath106 , as their perpendicular momenta also increase due to the conservation of the transversal adiabatic invariant , @xmath107 .",
    "with the depletion of energetic electrons , the hard x - ray coronal emission would become weaker relative to the footpoints .",
    "its centroid location would move to a slightly higher altitude relative to the soft x - ray loop , because electrons trapped at lower magnetic loops ( with larger loss - cone angles ) would be depleted from the coronal trap first . with the enhanced precipitation rate , low - energy electrons",
    "would still be stopped at the thick - thin target , but more high - energy electrons would precipitate towards the chromosphere .",
    "thus , the footpoint spectrum would be successively hardening , while the coronal spectrum successive softening , as observed in the masuda flare .    to summarize",
    ", we demonstrate through an uncertainty analysis that the hard x - ray coronal source of the masuda flare is located much closer to the soft x - ray loop in the re - calibrated hxt images than in the original ones .",
    "this may account for the change of the spectral characteristics of the coronal source derived from imaging spectroscopic analysis .",

    "<S> we revisit the flare on 1992 january 13 , which is now universally termed the `` masuda flare '' . </S>",
    "<S> the revisit is motivated not only by its uniqueness despite accumulating observations of hard x - ray coronal emission , but also by the improvement of yohkoh hard x - ray imaging , which was achieved after the intensive investigations on this celebrated event . through an uncertainty analysis </S>",
    "<S> , we show that the hard x - ray coronal source is located much closer to the soft x - ray loop in the re - calibrated hxt images than in the original ones . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , the centroid of the m1-band ( 2333 kev ) coronal source is above the brightest pixel of the sxt loop by @xmath0 km ( @xmath1 km in the original data ) ; and above the apex of the 30% brightness contour of the sxt loop by @xmath2 km ( @xmath3 km in the original data ) . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that this change may naturally account for the fact that the spectrum of the coronal emission was reported to be extremely hard below @xmath420 kev in the pre - calibration investigations , whereas it has been considerably softer in the literature since sato s re - calibration circa 1999 . </S>",
    "<S> still , the coronal spectrum is flatter at lower energies than at higher energies , owing to the lack of a similar source in the l - band ( 1423 kev ) , which remains a puzzle . </S>"
