    "these slave - particles verify usual commutation rules but , they are fictitious and sometimes it is not clear if the obtained results are genuine or artifacts from merely decoupling . on the other hand , the decoupling scheme introduces a gauge degree of freedom which requires a gauge fixing .",
    "the gauge fixing is a long discussed fundamental problem ( see for example ref . [ ] ) .",
    "another problem in the treatment of the @xmath10 model is the absence of any small coupling parameter suitable for a perturbative expansion . to deal with this problem",

    "the coulomb term enters in our approach multiplied by @xmath186 which means that the effect of @xmath6 , at low doping , is strongly screened by the correlations .",
    "we note that in the sba @xmath6 can enter in different manners depending on the way chosen for the decoupling .    in fig.7",
    "we show the phase diagram in the @xmath187 plane for j=0 and @xmath126 .",
    "the curves show , as a function of @xmath3 , the critical coulomb repulsion @xmath7 where the cdw instability takes place . for @xmath188",
    "the hfl is stable .",

    "then , the system win kinetic energy when @xmath2 is finite and , a larger @xmath6 is necessary in order to localize the charges .",
    "\\b ) as we see in the element @xmath81 of @xmath193 , the effect of @xmath6 is diminished when @xmath2 is finite .",
    "the term @xmath194 in the element @xmath81 comes from the charge - like term @xmath195 of the pure @xmath10 model , which is of the same form of the coulomb term ( see eq.3 ) .    in order to identify the main source for the increasing of @xmath7 we looked for the cdw instability without the charge - like term in ( 3 ) . under this condition , for @xmath126 and @xmath127",
    ", @xmath7 is @xmath196 .",
    "this value is nearly the same than @xmath7 for @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , b ) is the main source for the increasing of @xmath7 with increasing @xmath2 .",
    "in contrast to the fp and bop , the cdw instability can be detected clearly by looking at the static charge susceptibility @xmath197 .",
    "in fig.8 we show , for @xmath126 and @xmath140 , @xmath197 vs @xmath198 for @xmath199 ( a little smaller than the critical value @xmath200 ) and @xmath201 . in the figure",
    ", we see that approaching @xmath7 , the static susceptibility tends to diverge near @xmath135 . for @xmath201 ( @xmath202 ) ,",
    "the static charge susceptibility is flat .    in this case",
    "the eigenvector corresponding to the zero eigenvalue is @xmath203 .",
    "then , the instability is mainly in the pure charge sector .    from fig.8 , in agreement with other methods @xcite ,",
    "the instability @xmath128-vector is always at @xmath135 .",
    "therefore , in the cdw phase , the charges order themselves forming a checkerboard pattern . for doping different to the commensurate one @xmath144 we must interpret the cdw instability",
    "as the system is charge - ordered but remains metallic .",
    "these results were obtained by different methods and the nature of the instability for doping different to the commensurate one is still open . for the commensurate doping @xmath144 in ref .",
    "[ ] we showed that the system is charge - ordered at @xmath204 however , we also find an insulator because the quasiparticle weight goes to zero exactly at this @xmath7 value .    in order to compare the above results to the predictions of the bkf method , we calculated the critical @xmath7 using the formulation of refs .",
    "[ ] [ ] for @xmath126 . for @xmath127 and @xmath205 we found @xmath206 and @xmath207 respectively .",
    "the agreement with our calculation is again very good in spite of the fact that the coulomb term enters bkf in a different way .",
    "from the path integral representation for the hubbard @xmath11-operators we have developed a new perturbative theory for the @xmath0 model .",
    "our formulation is free of slave - particles and the @xmath11-operators are treated as fundamental objects .      to work directly with the @xmath11-operators",
    "has several advantages upon the slave - particles methods .",
    "for example , in the slave - boson theory , the decoupling procedure introduces a gauge degree of freedom and then , an additional problem as the gauge fixing arises .",
    "this problem does not occur in our formulation . on the other hand , in the slave approaches , in contrast to our method , beyond a mean field level ,",
    "a convolution between slave - particles propagators is necessary to reconstruct the original physical propagator .",
    "it is important to note that we can not read the interaction vertices from the @xmath76 and @xmath2 terms of the hamiltonian .",
    "they arise from the nonpolynomial effective theory defined by @xmath62 in eq.(6 ) .",
    "all the interactions caused by the hubbard algebra ( commutation rules and constraints ) were transfered to @xmath62 .",
    "we have studied charge correlations functions and we have investigated the role of collective effects .",
    "this study shows the presence of collective peaks ( or zero sound ) which are more evident when they are separated from the particle - hole continuum . on the other hand ,",
    "the collective peaks become broader when they are superimposed to the particle - hole continuum",
    ". one important characteristic of the charge correlation function is the fact that this is not strongly dependent on the value of the exchange interaction @xmath2 .    at large @xmath1 , the theory can be described as a homogeneous fermi liquid with renormalized band due to correlations .",
    "we have studied the stability of this fermi liquid phase . for a given value of @xmath2 ,",
    "the fermi liquid phase is stable for doping @xmath209",
    ". the critical doping @xmath4 decreases with decreasing @xmath2 . for doping below @xmath4",
    "the system enters in a flux or bond order phase depending if @xmath210 or @xmath211 respectively .",
    "these instabilities are weakly coupled to the charge sector which means that any charge - probe is not an efficient test to detect them .",
    "one important characteristic of these new phases is that they are incommensurate with a modulation vector @xmath212 where the incommensuration @xmath153 tends to @xmath37 when @xmath2 goes to zero .",
    "we also have investigated the role of a nearest - neighbors coulomb repulsion @xmath6 on the stability conditions of the fermi liquid .",
    "when @xmath6 is larger than a critical value @xmath7 , the system enters , at a given doping , in charge density wave state .",
    "the value of @xmath7 increases with increasing @xmath2 .",
    "we have identified in the charge - like term of the pure @xmath10 model the main reason for this increase .",
    "we have continuously compared our results with similar ones in the literature .",
    "the agreement of our results with those obtained by other methods give confidence to the results and the approach of the present paper .    at leading order ,",
    "our formalism is in agreement with the slave - boson approach .",
    "however , at the next to leading order ( which is necessary to calculate dynamical properties ) the differences between the two formulations are not yet completely established .",
    "we think that the complications that appear in the slave - boson method beyond mean field level as gauge fixing , bose condensation , regularizing factors @xcite are not good for the advance of the field . in our case",
    "we do not have these problems and we think that our approach can be useful to go beyond the mean field level . with the formulation for finite @xmath2 in hand , we expect to continue in this direction as we did for @xmath12 in ref ."
