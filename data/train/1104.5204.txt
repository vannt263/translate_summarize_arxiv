    "three dimensional ( 3d ) topological band insulators ( ti ) have attracted considerable attention from the con- densed matter and device physics communities for the novel electronic surface states they support and the host of unusual responses to external fields@xcite .",
    "the basic understanding of their electronic structure , using density functional theory ( dft ) is a continuing quest in the literature .",
    "these studies have contributed to the growth of the field and helped with interpreting experiments . in recent years ,",
    "binary 3d ti materials bi@xmath0se@xmath1 and bi@xmath0te@xmath1 have emerged as model systems for numerous experiments which focused on exfoliation and the molecular beam epitaxy growth of thin films and for probing the electronic structure by optical techniques@xcite and device fabrications@xcite .",
    "the theoretical works , based on density functional theory or tight - binding calculations , focused on elucidating the structure - property relations , predicting new tis , and mapping the band structures@xcite .",
    "one of the concerns for the use of binary ti materials in devices is the intrinsic _ n_(or _ p_)-type vacancies in the bulk crystals of bi@xmath0se@xmath1 ( bi@xmath0te@xmath1 ) which make the conduction through bulk states dominate transport experiments@xcite and the hexagonal _ warping _ effect that makes the dirac cone anisotropic , especially in the conduction band region .",
    "this anisotropic nature of the dirac cone leads to interesting spin - textures ( or spin - momentum locking ) of surface states with possible applications in spintronics and quantum information processing@xcite .",
    "recently , two promising 3d ti materials , tlbix@xmath0 ( x= se , te ) and bi@xmath0x@xmath0y ( x , y = se , te ) have been predicted to have near perfect dirac cones , in terms of less entanglement of bulk and surface states , and experiments have supported these predictions.@xcite . moreover",
    ", bi - based ternary compounds offer high bulk resistivity , due to the structurally perfect nature of the crystals , so surface transport is enhanced .    in view of these promising advances ,",
    "a comprehensive theoretical study of the thin - film structures of these ternary 3d ti is necessary to help better understand these materials and to help design future experiments to verify these effects .",
    "these materials can have intrinsic size limits which can protect the metallic nature of the surface bands , the surface states can spread inside the bulk region , and atomic rearrangements in thin layers can have profound effect on the dirac cone itself .",
    "we address these issues in this paper using a dft - based electronic structure method and compare our results with available experimental results as well as with the results of binary bi - based tis .",
    "our studies will have implications for the understanding of topological surface states in ternary tis and their intended applications .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we describe the bulk crystal structures of tlbix@xmath0 ( x = se , te ) and bi@xmath0x@xmath0y ( x , y = se , te ) , their conduction band ( cb ) and valence band ( vb ) structures and the computational method used for this study . in section",
    "iii we present the thin film electronic structure of these materials and discuss the role of atomic relaxations or rearragements , resulting from thin film formation from the bulk crystal , on the shape and size of the dirac cone in the bulk , and predict critical film thicknesses required to maintain the dirac cone and degree of surface state extension into the bulk region which have yet to be determined experimentally for these class of materials .",
    "we compare these results with those available for binary ti compounds .",
    "finally , in setion iv , we present our summary and conclusions .",
    "this section details the computational method used , the choice of computational parameters , the bulk crystal structures and the resulting electronic band structure . the bulk crystal structures of both tl and bi - based ternary compounds are similar to the binary compounds bi@xmath0x@xmath1(x = se , te ) .",
    "both compounds have a trigonal structure with covalently bonded alternating cations and anion layers stacked along the crystallographic _ z_-direction .",
    "however , there is one important difference as compared to the binary compounds : the atomic layers of these tl - based structures are not arranged in a quintuple - like ( ql ) order , suggesting covalent bonding between the unit - cells , and therefore , that exfoliation techniques , used to peel binary ti flakes from the corresponding bulk crystals , can not be used for extractng tl - based ti thin films .",
    "the layers are arranged in the order tl - se(te)-bi - se(te ) .",
    "the trigonal unit cell contains four atoms ( as opposed to five in binary bi - based tis ) with the lattice parameter _ a _ = 0.7887 nm(0.8263 nm ) and the angle between the lattice vectors spanning the lattice of @xmath2@xmath331.4@xmath4(@xmath331.8@xmath4 ) for tlbise@xmath0(tlbite@xmath0)@xcite .",
    "the hexagonal cell , formed from the trigonal , consists of twelve atomic layers with the number of atoms tripled ( fig .",
    "the lattice parameters of the hexagonal cell are _",
    "nm(0.4534 nm ) and _",
    "c_=2.2478 nm(2.3512 nm ) for tlbise@xmath0(tlbite@xmath0 ) and the layer sequence in this case is same as the trigonal cell .",
    "compared to the corresponding binary compound , the bi - based ternary compound bi@xmath0se@xmath0te ( bi@xmath0te@xmath0se ) has one of the se ( te ) layers replaced by a te ( se ) layer , and has the layers arranged in the order te(se)-se(te)-bi - bi - se(te ) .",
    "the ql - like layer arrangement in these compounds facilitates exfoliation - like methods which can be used to peel thin films from the bulk - crystals .",
    "the lattice parameters of the bulk trigonal cell is almost same for bi@xmath0se@xmath0te ( bi@xmath0te@xmath0se ) : _ a _ = 1.0046 nm(1.0255 nm ) and @xmath2 @xmath3 24.2@xmath4 ( @xmath3 24.1@xmath4)@xcite .",
    "the hexagonal cell , built from the trigonal structure , contains fifteen atomic layers with the lattice parameters _ a _ = 0.422 nm(0.428 nm ) and _ c _ = 2.92 nm(2.99 nm ) for bi@xmath0se@xmath0te ( bi@xmath0te@xmath0se ) ( fig .",
    "1(b ) ) .    we used a dft - based electronic structure method with projector - augmented wave basis@xcite and a generalized gradient approximation to the exchange - correlation potential@xcite for computing the electronic properties of the bulk and thin films of both of the compounds . spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) was invoked in the calculation as implemented in the numerical method@xcite . for the bulk structural optimizations of both the compounds , a kinetic energy cut - off of 400 ev and a non - orthogonal * k*-point mesh along the reciprocal lattice vectors of 9 @xmath5 9 @xmath5 9 in the first brillouin zone ( bz ) were chosen . since previous structural studies of bulk trigonal structures reported agreement with experimental lattice parameters@xcite , we chose to relax only the internal parameters , namely the atomic positions , keeping the lattice constants fixed to experimental values .",
    "the total energy is assumed to be converged when all the components of hellman - feynman forces on each ion are smaller than the threshold 0.001 ev /  .",
    "convergence of computed properties were carefully checked with respect to large energy cut - off , * k*-point mesh and larger force threshold . for both the compounds , the computed interlayer distances are quite close to the experimental works@xcite .",
    "these computed distances suggest van der waals type of bonding between the adjacent qls in ternary bi - based ti but not in tl - based tis . with these informations",
    ", we built the bulk hexagonal cell and the corresponding thin - films of both the compounds as detailed in the next section .",
    "+   +    the bulk band structures of tlbix@xmath0 ( x= se , te ) , without and with soc , agree well with other theoretical calculations@xcite .",
    "however , with soc , other calculations predict tlbite@xmath0 to be an _",
    "indirect _ semiconductor with the cb minimum ( cbm ) at the @xmath6 point and the vb maximum ( vbm ) on the line joining the * l * and * z*-points .",
    "the high - symmetry points are labeled in fig .",
    "recent experimental studies argue tlbite@xmath0 to be a * semimetal * with an negative energy gap of 20 mev@xcite .",
    "our results agree well with this experimental work ( fig .",
    "tlbise@xmath0 has a direct gap at @xmath6 of 124 mev(235 mev ) without(with ) soc .",
    "figure 2(b ) and ( c ) show the bulk band structures of bi@xmath0x@xmath0y ( x , y=(te , se ) or,(se , te ) ) with soc , which agree quite well with a recent dft calculation@xcite .",
    "the cbm is at the @xmath6-point and the vbm is between @xmath7 and @xmath8-points for both the bi - based tis .",
    "the computed _ indirect _ gap are 157 mev and 272 mev , for bi@xmath0se@xmath0te and bi@xmath0te@xmath0se , respectively .",
    "we note that the gap is _ direct _ at the @xmath6-point without including soc with the gap values of 633 mev and 76 mev , for bi@xmath0se@xmath0te and bi@xmath0te@xmath0se , respectively .    in the literature ,",
    "emergence of these topological surface states within the bulk band gap of binary 3d tis was associated with the bulk _ band inversion _ when soc is switched on@xcite .",
    "we tested this conjecture by plotting the specific orbital contributions from a given atom as a function of * k * and band on the band structure diagrams of figs . 2 and 3 .",
    "these specific contributions are normalized with respect to the contributions from all the orbitals in both the bulk tl- and bi - based ternary compounds .",
    "since the bulk cbm and vbm at @xmath6 consist mainly of @xmath9 orbitals@xcite of the bi and se(te ) atoms , respectively for tl - based compounds , this state was chosen for the orbital projection studies .",
    "in tl - based tis , a cut - off contribution percentage is chosen which gives a reasonable picture of _ band inversion _ in these figures .",
    "if the calculated @xmath9 orbital contribution of a specific atom at a certain state is greater than a given cut - off percentage , we considered this state as mainly originating from that atom .",
    "this cut - off was set at 50@xmath10 and 25@xmath10 for se(te ) and bi atoms , respectively .",
    "a slight change in a cut - off percentage , below or above these choices , resulted in an insignificant change for the cbm and vbm bands at the @xmath6-point , which is region of interest to study the _ band inversion _ process .",
    "for example , the @xmath9 orbital contributions on the band structure of tlbite@xmath0 in fig .",
    "2(a ) remain similar near the cbm and vbm around the @xmath6-point with the cut - off percentage of 45@xmath10 and 22.5@xmath10 for te and bi atoms , respectively ( figures not shown ) . a similar _ band inversion _",
    "effect was also seen in bi - based tis ( bi@xmath0te@xmath0se and bi@xmath0se@xmath0te ) .",
    "this effect is shown only for one of the compound bi@xmath0te@xmath0se ( fig .",
    "3(a ) and ( b ) ) .",
    "the other compounds show similar effects ( figures not shown ) .",
    "we gave an equal weight of 30@xmath10 to both bi and te(se ) orbital contributions since the two outermost layers of se(te ) and bi , out of the total of five atomic layers within each ql , mainly particpate in forming the vbm and cbm .",
    "in this section we discuss the surface states of ternary tis .",
    "first we discuss the interesting nature of surface states in tl- and bi - based tis .",
    "we compare our results with binary bi - based tis , wherever possible .",
    "we choose kinetic energy cut - off of 400 ev and * k*-mesh size of 9 @xmath5 9 @xmath5 1 on the surface bz of the hexagonal supercell for computing surface band structure of both tl- and bi - based ternary tis .",
    "the thin films of tl - based tis are built from the bulk hexagonal structure with the atomic layers stacked along the crystallographic _ z _ direction and a net vacuum size of 3 nm above the top layer and below the bottom layer within a periodic simulation region .",
    "recent theoretical@xcite studies suggest contributions to the surface band structure from the dangling bonds arising from the surface terminations , and that these dangling states appear along with the topological surface states . among four surface terminations , with the atomic layer ordering as tl - se(te)-bi - se(te ) , se(te)-bi - se(te)-tl , bi - se(te)-tl - se(te ) and se(te)-tl - se(te)-bi , the one with se(te ) beneath the tl layer is argued to have minimal surface dangling bond densitys@xcite .",
    "therefore we chose this termination in all further thin film studies .",
    "we note here that experiments do not observe any signature of dangling bond states in the optical spectra@xcite . and , at least for this termination , we do not find any signature of the dangling bond state either , at least , within the dirac cone region .",
    "different thicknesses of the thin films of tlbise@xmath0 , ranging from 23 to 39 layers , corresponding to thicknesses of 4 to 7 nm and 23 to 31 layers for tlbite@xmath0 with the maximum thickness value of 5.8 nm were considered .",
    "figure 4(a ) shows a representative supercell structure of 39 layers of tlbise@xmath0 .",
    "we consider the relaxation of atomic positions in the _",
    "z_-direction since it is argued that the positions of se(te ) atoms are critical in determining the topological nature of the surface states@xcite .",
    "the positions are assumed to be optimized when the _ z_-component of the forces are smaller than the threshold value 0.015 ev /  .    as for the bi - based binary compounds ,",
    "tl - based ternary compounds also show thickness dependent electronic structure .",
    "the dirac cone is preserved in tlbise@xmath0 with 39 atomic layers , corresponding to a thickness of 7 nm ( fig .",
    "5(a ) ) , and in tlbite@xmath0 with 31 layers of a thickness 5.8 nm ( fig .",
    "5(b ) ) , where red circles denote surface state contributions and the solid black lines represent the bulk bands .",
    "we reproduce the interesting experimental features of tlbise@xmath0@xcite and tlbi@xmath0te@xcite .",
    "the bulk vb ( bvb ) , in tlbi@xmath0se has two maxima between @xmath11 and m points in the hexagonal bz ( fig .",
    "4(b ) ) and the bulk cb ( bcb ) has a minimum at m. the dirac cone is found to exist inside the bulk band gap , at the @xmath11-point of the bz .",
    "these features are clearly seen in our computed band structure ( fig .",
    "our computed band structure of tlbite@xmath0 shows that the dirac point is below the bvbm ( fig .",
    "the bcbm is placed at @xmath11 and the bvbm along the line joining @xmath11 and m , producing an indirect gap of 83 mev .",
    "another bvbm emerges along the line joining @xmath11 to k. these features including the indirect gap size , positions of bvb , bcb and the dirac point are consistent with the recent experimental study@xcite .    for thin film thicknesses corresponding to fewer than 39 ( 31 ) atomic layers in tlbise@xmath0 ( tlbite@xmath0 )",
    ", our study suggests that a band gap opens in the otherwise metallic surface states , much like those in binary bi - based tis@xcite . with decreasing thicknesses",
    ", the size of the gap seems to increase indicating the increased interactions between surfaces states that exist on two opposite surfaces of the ti ( figures not shown ) .",
    "the gap values are summarized in table i. there are no experimental reports , so far , on the critical film thickness necessary to preserve the metallic bands for tl - based ternary tis which our theoretical study predicts .",
    "it is interesting to note that the predicted induced gaps in tl - based tis , for the same film thickness , are larger than the binary bi - based tis @xcite .",
    ".the induced band gap at the time - reversal invariant point @xmath11 @xmath12e@xmath13 ( in ev ) for thin - films with various thicknesses . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we use a density functional based electronic structure method to study the thin film surface state properties of tl and bi - based ternary topologicial insulators .",
    "these studies predict that the dirac cone remains protected in thinner layers of ternary bi - based tis than in binary bi - based tis or than in tl - based tis , which may be advantageous for certain applications .",
    "however , we also predict that in the atomically relaxed strucures , the dirac cone of all but bi@xmath0se@xmath1 lie in or near the bvb . however , the dirac cone of bi@xmath0se@xmath0te remains outside of the bvb in the absence of relaxation , as might occur with dielectrics replacing the air gap . and",
    ", of course , the bonding to the dielectric could directly affect the surface states as well .",
    "our computed results agree very well with experimental results where available , while other predictions such as the critical film thicknesses required to maintain the dirac cone , size of the induced gaps , and the extent of the spread of surface states in the bulk region point to further needed experimental work .",
