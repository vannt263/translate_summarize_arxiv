    "in this paper we are interested in the existence and regularity of minimizers of the following problem : @xmath1 where , for @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , we have set @xmath5 here @xmath6 stands for the perimeter of @xmath7 and , letting @xmath8 be the set of probability measures supported on the closure of @xmath7 , we set for @xmath9 , @xmath10 and for @xmath11 , @xmath12 notice that , up to rescaling , we can assume , as we shall do for the rest of the paper , that @xmath13 .",
    "starting from the seminal work of lord rayleigh @xcite ( in the coulombic case @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) , the functional has been extensively studied in the physical literature to model the shape of charged liquid drops ( see @xcite and the references therein ) . in particular , it is known that the ball is a _ linearly _ stable critical point for if the charge @xmath16 is not too large ( see for instance @xcite ) . however , quite surprisingly , the authors showed in @xcite that , without the convexity constraint , never admits minimizers under volume constraint for any @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "in particular , this implies that in this model a charged drop is always _ nonlinearly _ unstable .",
    "this result is in sharp contrast with experiments ( see for instance @xcite ) , where there is evidence of stability of the ball for small charges .",
    "this suggests that the energy @xmath19 does not include all the physically relevant contributions .",
    "as shown in @xcite , a possible way to gain well - posedness of the problem is requiring some extra regularity of the admissible sets . in this paper",
    ", we consider an alternative type of constraint , namely the convexity of admissible sets .",
    "this assumption seems reasonable as long as the minimizers remain strictly convex , that is for small enough charges .",
    "let us point out that in @xcite , still another regularizing mechanism is proposed . there",
    ", well - posedness is obtained by adding an entropic term which prevents charges to concentrate too much on the boundary of @xmath7 .    using the good compactness properties of convex sets ,",
    "our first result is the existence of minimizers for every charge @xmath17 .",
    "[ teoesist ] for every @xmath20 and every @xmath16 , admits a minimizer .",
    "we then study the regularity of minimizers . as often in variational problems with convexity constraints , regularity ( or singularity ) of minimizers is hard to deal with in dimension larger than two ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we thus restrict ourselves to @xmath21 .",
    "since our analysis strongly uses the regularity of _ equilibrium measures _",
    "( i.e. the minimizer of ) , we are further reduced to study the case @xmath22 ( that is @xmath11 in this case ) .",
    "the second main result of the paper is then    [ teoreg ] let @xmath21 and @xmath11 , then for every @xmath17 , the minimizers of are of class @xmath0 .",
    "since we are able to prove uniform @xmath0 estimates as @xmath16 goes to zero , building upon our previous stability results established in @xcite , we get    [ corballs ] if @xmath21 and @xmath11 , for @xmath16 small enough , the only minimizers of are balls .    the proof of theorem [ teoreg ] is based on the natural idea of comparing the minimizers with a competitor made by `` cutting out the angles '' .",
    "however , the non - local nature of the problem makes the estimates non - trivial .",
    "as already mentioned , a crucial point is an estimate on the integrability of the equilibrium measures .",
    "this is obtained by drawing a connection with harmonic measures ( see section [ secdens ] ) .",
    "let us point out that , up to proving the regularity of the shape functional @xmath23 and computing its shape derivative , one could have obtained a proof of theorem [ teoreg ] by applying the abstract regularity result of @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , since our proof has a nice geometrical flavor and since regularity of @xmath23 is not known in dimension two ( in higher dimension , one can exploit the connection with the capacity to prove it @xcite ) , we decided to keep it as it is .",
    "+ we remark that , differently from the two - dimensional case , when @xmath14 we expect the onset of singularities at a critical value @xmath24 , with the shape of a spherical cone with a prescribed angle .",
    "such singularities are also observed in experiments and are usually called _ taylor cones _ ( see @xcite ) . at the moment we are not able to show the presence of such singularities in our model , and this will be the subject of future research .",
    "+ eventually , in section [ seclim ] , we study the behavior of the optimal sets when the charge goes to infinity . even though this regime is less significant from the point of view of the applications , we believe that it is still mathematically interesting .",

    "this fact is fairly classical .",

    "let us point out that most definitions and results of this section extend to the case @xmath64 and @xmath22 , and to more general classes of sets .",
    "in particular , for bounded lipschitz sets , the fact that harmonic measures are absolutely continuous with respect to the surface measure with @xmath94 densities for @xmath95 was established in @xcite , and extended later to more general domains ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "the interest for harmonic measures stems from the fact that they bear a lot of geometric information ( see in particular @xcite ) .",

    "we stress also that the exponent @xmath101 and the bound on the @xmath94 norm of its equilibrium measure depend indeed on the set : for instance , a sequence of convex sets with smooth boundaries converging to a square can not have equilibrium measures with densities uniformly bounded in @xmath94 for @xmath104 .",
