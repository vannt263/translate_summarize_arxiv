    "a thorough understanding of @xmath9 hadronic decays requires both branching ratio measurements of all the hadronic modes and dalitz plot analyses to investigate the decay dynamics and probe the role of final state interactions . in this letter",
    "we present branching ratio measurements and dalitz plot analyses of the doubly and singly cabibbo suppressed decays @xmath10 and @xmath8 .",
    "the nave expectation for the ratio of doubly cabibbo suppressed ( dcs ) to cabibbo favored ( cf ) branching fractions is @xmath11% . however the cf @xmath12 rate could be suppressed by destructive interference between spectator amplitudes with indistinguishable quarks in the final state ; this is the argument generally proposed to explain the lifetime difference between @xmath0 and @xmath13 . for the hadronic dcs @xmath0 decay all the final state quarks are different and",
    "no destructive interference is present . in this simple picture",
    "we would expect , neglecting effects of final state interactions , @xmath14 .",
    "the comparison of the precise focus lifetime ratio @xcite @xmath15 with the branching ratio @xmath16 measurement reported here will test this interpretation .",
    "the final @xmath0 and @xmath7 samples are selected with cuts to reduce reflections from the more copious cabibbo favored modes and to optimize the signal to noise ratios , which are crucial for reliable decay amplitude analyses .",
    "dalitz plot analyses have indeed emerged as a unique tool to fully exploit the available charm statistics allowing , besides the simple branching ratio evaluation , to investigate the underlying decay dynamics .",
    "our understanding of the charm decay dynamics has already considerably improved in the last years , but is still limited to a few decay channels .",
    "the dalitz plot analysis of the singly cabibbo suppressed decay ( scs ) @xmath17 is performed for the first time .",
    "the data for this analysis were collected during the 19961997 run of the photoproduction experiment focus at fermilab .",
    "the detector , designed and used to study the interaction of high - energy photons on a segmented beo target , is a large aperture , fixed - target magnetic spectrometer with excellent erenkov particle identification and vertexing capabilities .",
    "most of the focus experiment and analysis techniques have been described previously @xcite .",
    "the suppressed nature of the channels under study requires severe cuts to eliminate reflections , both in the signal and sideband regions , from more copious and favored decays , when one or two charged particles are erenkov misidentified and/or one neutral particle is missing .",
    "tight cut choices are also required to improve the signal - to - noise ratio to perform a reliable dalitz plot analysis .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath7 candidates are obtained using a candidate driven vertex algorithm .",
    "a decay vertex is formed from three reconstructed charged tracks .",
    "the momentum of the @xmath9 candidate is used to intersect other reconstructed tracks to form a production vertex",
    ". the confidence levels ( c.l . ) of each vertex is required to exceed 1% . from the vertexing algorithm , the variable @xmath18 , which is the separation of the primary and secondary vertices , and its associated error @xmath19",
    "are calculated .",
    "we reduce backgrounds by requiring @xmath20 and 10 for the @xmath0 and @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "the two vertices are also required to satisfy isolation conditions .",
    "the primary vertex isolation cut requires that a track assigned to the decay vertex has a c.l .",
    "less than 1% to be included in the primary vertex .",
    "the secondary vertex isolation cut requires that all remaining tracks not assigned to the primary and secondary vertex have a c.l.smaller than 0.1% to form a vertex with the @xmath9 candidate daughters .",
    "the decay vertex is required to be @xmath22 outside of the target material to reduce the background due to hadronic re - interactions in the target .",
    "the erenkov particle identification is based on likelihood ratios between the various stable particle hypotheses @xcite .",
    "the product of all firing probabilities for all cells within the three erenkov cones produces a @xmath23-like variable @xmath24=-2ln(likelihood ) where @xmath25 ranges over the electron , pion , kaon and proton hypothesis . for the @xmath0 selection ,",
    "we require @xmath26 @xmath27 and @xmath28 @xmath29 for both pions in the final state . for the @xmath7 candidates we require @xmath30 for the kaon , @xmath31 for opposite - sign pion and @xmath32 for same - sign pion .",
    "these selections minimize the contamination from charm background .    a detailed monte carlo study is performed to evaluate the possible contaminations and structures induced by reflections both in the signal and sideband regions .",
    "cover the @xmath33 to @xmath34 and the @xmath35 to @xmath36 regions from the @xmath0 peak . for the @xmath21",
    "the left sideband covers the @xmath33 to @xmath34 region and the right sideband covers the @xmath37 to @xmath38 region , both from the @xmath21 peak . ] the considered sources of background are the @xmath0 and @xmath7 three - body hadronic decays , where one or two particles are misidentified , and four - body hadronic and semileptonic decays , where charged particles are misidentified and neutrals are missing , namely : @xmath12 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 . for each of them",
    "we evaluate the number and the distribution shape of events which survive the selection cuts and penetrate into the @xmath0 and @xmath1 signal and sideband regions . from this study , we find that the major contributions for @xmath0 come from @xmath12 , @xmath39 and @xmath45 , and for @xmath21 from @xmath12 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 . in fig .",
    "[ segnali ] the selected @xmath48 combinations for @xmath0 and @xmath7 are shown , along with the distribution of the monte carlo reflected events .",
    "we choose to start our fit from the 1.75 @xmath49 energy threshold since the region below is dominated by the partial reconstruction of multi - body charm channels where neutrals are missing .",
    "the signal yields consist of @xmath50 events for @xmath0 and @xmath6 events for @xmath7 .",
    "the fits are performed with two gaussian functions for the signals and a second order polynomial for the background .",
    "centroid and width are @xmath51 and @xmath52 for @xmath0 ( fig .",
    "[ segnale_dcs ] ) , and @xmath53 and @xmath54 for @xmath7 ( fig .",
    "[ segnale_scs ] ) .",
    "the measured widths are in good agreement with the monte carlo predictions . the signal to noise ratio are @xmath55 and @xmath56 for @xmath0 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "the reflected events are smoothly distributed across the invariant mass spectrum and are thus properly accounted for by the background polynomial fitting function .",
    "residual structures induced by reflections in the dalitz plot signal and sideband regions are a potential source of systematics of our amplitude analysis .",
    "the shape of the background in the dalitz signal region is parametrized through a fit to the dalitz plot of mass sidebands , which consists of a polynomial plus breit - wigner functions to account for any feed - through from resonances .",
    "we verify that the reflections in the sidebands are well described by this simple background fit function and adequately represent the reflections in the signal regions .",
    "the dcs @xmath10 decay fraction is evaluated with respect to the cf @xmath12 mode , the scs @xmath57 with respect to the cf @xmath39 mode . in fig .",
    "[ segnale_norm ] the mass distributions for the normalization channels are shown .",
    "the cf @xmath12 sample is selected with the same set of cuts as for the dcs channel , in order to minimize systematic effects ; the signal yield is @xmath58 .",
    "the cf @xmath59 is obtained requiring for @xmath60 a @xmath61 similar to the @xmath62 for the opposite - sign pion in the scs selection ; kinematical cuts are applied to remove the reflections in the @xmath63 mode from the cf @xmath12 and from @xmath64 , followed by the @xmath13 decay to @xmath65 .",
    "the @xmath66 signal yield is @xmath67 .",
    "a fully coherent generation is used both for the channels under study and the normalization modes ; the relative efficiencies are measured to be @xmath68 and @xmath69      and @xmath39 normalization channels.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ] [ segnale_cf ]   and @xmath39 normalization channels.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ] [ segnale_kkp ]    from the yields and efficiency ratios , we measure the following branching ratios , @xmath70 and @xmath71    the first error reported is statistical and the second is systematic .    to evaluate the systematic error we consider , as done in other focus analyses @xcite , three contributions , which are added in quadrature to obtain the global systematic error : the _ split sample _ , _ fit variant _ and _ cut variant _ components .",
    "the _ split sample _ component takes into account the systematics introduced by residual difference between data and monte carlo , due to a possible mismatch in the reproduction of the @xmath9 momentum and the changing experimental conditions of the spectrometer during data collection .",
    "this component has been determined by splitting data into four independent subsamples , according to the @xmath9 momentum range ( high and low momentum ) and the configuration of the vertex detector .",
    "the _ s - factor method _ from the particle data group @xcite was used to try to separate true systematic variations from statistical fluctuations .",
    "the branching ratio is evaluated for each of the four statistically independent subsamples and a _ scaled variance _ is calculated @xmath72 ( the errors are boosted when @xmath73 ) .",
    "the _ split sample _ variance is defined as the difference between the reported statistical variance and the scaled variance , if the scaled variance exceeds the statistical variance .",
    "another possible source of systematics uncertainty is the _",
    "fit variant_. this component is computed by varying the fitting conditions on the whole data set . in our study",
    "fit variants include the background and signal shape , the bin size of the mass - distribution histogram and the monte carlo generation modeling .",
    "more precisely different degrees of the polynomial functions are used for the background parametrization and two gaussian peaks with the same mean but different widths are used for the signal , to take into account the different resolution in momentum of our spectrometer .",
    "the fully coherent generation for the decays under analysis is based on the results of the dalitz plot study presented in this paper ( see paragraph [ results ] ) . to access a possible systematics effect in the branching ratio evaluation coming from our amplitude analysis we vary coefficients and phases returned by the dalitz plot fit within their errors .",
    "the branching ratio values obtained by these variants are all a priori likely , therefore this uncertainty can be estimated by the standard deviation of the measurements . to investigate the dependence of the branching ratio on the particular choice of cuts we calculate a _ cut variant _ error , analogously to the _ fit variant _ , by using the standard deviation of different branching ratio measurements obtained with several sets of cuts ; this error is actually overestimated since the statistics of the cut samples are different .    for the @xmath0",
    "the dominant systematic effect comes from the _ cut variant _ , while for the @xmath7 the main source of uncertainty comes from the _ split sample _ component .",
    "our results are consistent with previous determinations from the e687 @xcite and e791 @xcite experiments .",
    "our measurements reduce the statistical errors by about a factor of 2 and 5 for the @xmath0 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "events within @xmath74 of the mass peak are used to perform the dalitz plot analysis for @xmath0 and @xmath8 ; the @xmath0 and @xmath7 dalitz plots are shown in fig.[dalitz ] a ) and b ) , respectively .      for this analysis we use a formalization of the decay amplitude based on the simple isobar model , which is viewed as an effective description of the main dynamical features of the decay .",
    "more rigorous treatments , such as that based on the _ k - matrix _",
    "formalism @xcite , are not viable for this analysis because of the limited statistics of the samples , along with the large number of free parameters necessary to account for the simultaneous presence of both @xmath75 and @xmath76 resonances .    the decay matrix element for the analysis reported here",
    "is written as a coherent sum of amplitudes corresponding to a constant term for the uniform direct three - body decay and to different resonant channels : @xmath77    where @xmath78 and @xmath79 label the final - state particles .",
    "@xmath80 where @xmath81 is the breit - wigner function @xmath82    and @xmath83 for a spin-0 resonance , @xmath84 for a spin-1 resonance and @xmath85 for a spin-2 state .",
    "@xmath86 and @xmath87 are the three - momenta of particles @xmath88 and @xmath79 measured in the @xmath89 rest frame , and @xmath90 and @xmath91 represent the strong coupling at each decay vertex . for each resonance of mass @xmath92 and spin @xmath93",
    "we use a width    @xmath94    where @xmath95 is the decay three - momentum in the resonance rest frame and the subscript @xmath96 denotes the on - shell values .",
    "the order of the particle labels is important for defining the phase convention ; here the first particle is the opposite - sign one .    for the @xmath97",
    "a simple single - channel breit - wigner is used .",
    "the mass and width values of @xmath98 and @xmath99 , respectively , are obtained from a fit to our focus dalitz plot of the @xmath100 channel , where the @xmath97 is the dominant component . given the questionable assumption of a single channel breit - wigner , where a coupled - channel one should be more properly used",
    ", we have checked that the final results do not change when a flatt parametrization @xcite is used .",
    "following our previous analyses @xcite we perform a maximum likelihood fit to the dalitz plots to measure the coefficients of the various decay amplitudes as well as their relative phases .",
    "the probability density function is corrected for geometrical acceptance and reconstruction efficiency .",
    "the shape of the background in the signal region is parametrized through an incoherent sum of a polynomial function plus resonant breit - wigner components , which are used to fit the dalitz plot of mass sidebands .",
    "the number of background events expected in the signal region is estimated through fits to the @xmath48 mass spectrum .",
    "all background parameters are included as additional fit parameters and tied to the results of the sideband fits through the inclusion in the likelihood of a @xmath23 penalty term derived from the covariance matrix of the sideband fit .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath21 samples are fitted with likelihood functions @xmath101 consisting of signal and background probability densities .",
    "checks for fitting procedure are made using monte carlo techniques and all biases are found to be small compared to the statistical errors .",
    "the systematic errors on our results are evaluated following the strategy already explained for the branching ratio measurements , defining a _ split - sample _ and a _ fit - variant _ component .",
    "the assumption that the shape of the background in the sideband is a good representation of the background in the signal region potentially constitutes a source of systematic error .",
    "we take into account this effect in the _ fit - variant _ error , by varying the polynomial function degree and adding / removing the breit - wigner terms , which are introduced to take into account any feed - through from resonances in the background , and computing the standard deviation of the different results .    in our dalitz plot analysis",
    "we allow for the possibility of contributions from all known @xmath76 and @xmath75 resonances@xcite and from a flat non - resonant contribution accounting for the direct decay of the d mesons into three - body final states .",
    "the fit parameters are amplitude coefficients @xmath102 and phases @xmath103 . , which is a dominant mode in both decays , are fixed to 1 and 0 , respectively .",
    "] the general procedure , adopted for all the fits reported here , consists of several successive steps in order to eliminate contributions whose effects on our fit are marginal .",
    "contributions are removed if their amplitude coefficients , @xmath104 and @xmath105 of eq .",
    "[ totamp ] are less than @xmath22 significant _ and _ the fit confidence level increases due to the decreased number of degrees of freedom in the fit . the fit confidence levels ( c.l . )",
    "are evaluated with a @xmath23 estimator over a dalitz plot with bin size adaptively chosen to maintain a minimum number of events in each bin .",
    "once the minimal set of parameters is determined , addition of each single contribution previously eliminated is reinstated to verify if the c.l .",
    "improves ; in this case the contribution is added in the final set .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath7 dalitz plots present a different event intensity distribution .",
    "the @xmath0 appears highly structured and dominated by @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "the @xmath7 channel , instead , presents a much more complex structure diffused over all the phase - space together with @xmath106 and @xmath107 , whose main characteristics are still visible .",
