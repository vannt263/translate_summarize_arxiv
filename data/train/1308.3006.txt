    "an experiment was performed by qin et al .",
    "@xcite to study the ablation of the ag@xmath1o film under different laser powers .",
    "the results suggested that the ag@xmath1o film can be used as an optical and magneto - optical storage material mainly because of its thermal decomposition reaction .",
    "chuang et al .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the critical thermal decomposition temperature ( cdt ) of the ago and ag@xmath0o phases are 160 and 380 @xmath4c , respectively , whereas abe et al .",
