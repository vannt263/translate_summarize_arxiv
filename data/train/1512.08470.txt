    "that single domain proteins should fold by parallel or multiple pathways emerges naturally from theoretical considerations@xcite and computational studies@xcite .",
    "the generality of the conclusions reached in the theoretical studies is sufficiently compelling , which makes it surprising that they are not routinely demonstrated in typical ensemble folding experiments .",
    "the reasons for the difficulties in directly observing parallel folding or unfolding pathways in monomeric proteins can be appreciated based on the following arguments .",
    "consider a protein that reaches the folded state by two different pathways .",
    "the ratio of flux through these pathways is proportional to @xmath7 $ ] , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are , respectively , the free energy barriers separating the folded and unfolded states along the two pathways , @xmath10 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath11 is the temperature .",
    "if @xmath12 is large compared to @xmath13 then the experimental detection of flux through the high free energy barrier pathway ( @xmath14 ) is unlikely .",
    "external perturbations ( such as mechanical force @xmath1 or denaturants @xmath4 $ ] ) could reduce @xmath15 .",
    "however , the values of @xmath1 ( or @xmath4 $ ] ) should fall in an experimentally accessible range for detecting a potential switch between pathways . despite these inherent limitations , clarke and coworkers , showed in a most insightful study that unfolding of immunoglobulin domain ( i27 ) induced by denaturants occurs by parallel routes@xcite .",
    "subsequently , additional experiments on single chain monellin @xcite , using denaturants and spectroscopic probes , have firmly shown the existence of multiple paths .",
    "thus , it appears that multiple folding routes can be detected in standard folding experiments @xcite provided the flux through the higher free energy barriers is not so small that it escapes detection .",
    "in addition , parallel folding pathways have been observed in repeat proteins , where inherent symmetry in the connectivity of the individual domains@xcite results in parallel assembly .",
    "single molecule pulling experiments in which @xmath1 is applied to specific locations on the protein have demonstrated that unfolding of many proteins follow complex multiple routes .",
    "mechanical force , unlike denaturants , does not alter the effective microscopic interactions between the residues , thus allowing for a cleaner interpretation .",
    "more importantly , by following the fate of many individual proteins the underlying heterogeneity in the routes explored by the protein can be revealed . indeed ,",
    "pulling experiments and simulations on a variety of single domain proteins@xcite show clear signatures of many routes for @xmath1-induced unfolding .",
    "it could be argued that in many of these studies the network of states connecting the folded and unfolded states is a consequence of complex topology , although they are all single domain proteins .",
    "however , the src sh3 domain is a small protein with no apparent symmetry in the arrangement of secondary structure elements which folds in an apparent two - state manner .",
    "thus , the discovery that it unfolds using parallel pathways@xcite is unexpected and requires a firm theoretical explanation and structural interpretation .    in single molecule pulling experiments , performed at constant force or constant loading rate , only a one dimensional coordinate , the molecular extension ( @xmath16 ) ,",
    "is readily measurable .",
    "when performed at constant @xmath1 , it is possible to generate folding trajectories ( @xmath16 as a function of time ) , from which equilibrium one - dimensional free energy profiles , @xmath17 , can be extracted using rigorous theory@xcite .",
    "the utility of @xmath17 hinges on the crucial assumption that all other degrees of freedom in the system including the solvent come to equilibrium on time scales much faster than in @xmath16 , so that @xmath16 itself may be considered to be an accurate reaction coordinate .",
    "a straightforward way to assess if a one - dimensional picture is adequate , is to analyze the @xmath1 dependence of the unfolding rate @xmath0 , which can be experimentally obtained at constant @xmath1 or computed from unfolding rates measured at different loading rates@xcite . the observed upward curvature in the [ @xmath18 $ ] plot in src sh3 @xcite ,",
    "was shown to be a consequence of unfolding by two pathways , one dominant at low forces and the other at high forces .",
    "it was succinctly argued that the measured [ @xmath18 $ ] data can not be explained by multiple barriers in a one dimensional ( 1d ) @xmath17 or a 1d profile with a single barrier in which the unfolding rate is usually fit using the bell model @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the unfolding rate at @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is the location of the barrier in @xmath17 at zero force with respect to the folded state .",
    "( throughout this paper , by location of the barrier , or the transition state , we mean the location with respect to the folded state . )",
    "the upward curvatures in the monotonic [ @xmath18 $ ] as well as [ @xmath23),[c]]$ ] plots , observed experimentally , necessarily imply that parallel routes are involved in the unfolding process .",
    "( a non - monotonic @xmath24 $ ] plot suggests catch bond behavior ) .    in order to provide",
    "a general framework for a quantitative explanation of a broad class of experiments , we first present a rigorous theoretical proof that upward curvature in [ @xmath18 $ ] ( or [ @xmath23),[c]]$ ] ) implies that the folding landscape is strongly multidimensional ( smd ) .",
    "hence , such smd landscapes can not be reduced to 1d or superposition of physically meaningful 1d landscapes , which can rationalize the observed convex [ @xmath25 plot .",
    "we note _ en passant _ that the shape of the measured [ @xmath18 $ ] plot can not be justified using @xmath17 even if @xmath22 were allowed to depend on @xmath1 , moving towards the folded state as @xmath1 increases .",
    "the theory only hinges on the assumption that the perturbation ( @xmath1 or @xmath4 $ ] ) is linearly coupled to the effective energy function of the protein . to illustrate the structural origin of the upward curvature in the [ @xmath18 $ ] plot we also performed simulations of @xmath1-induced unfolding of src sh3 domain , in order to identify the structural details of the unfolding pathways including the movement of transition states as the force",
    "is increased .",
    "the results of the simulations semi - quantitatively reproduce the experimental [ @xmath26 plots for both the wild - type ( wt ) and the v61a mutant .",
    "more importantly , we also provide the structural basis of the switch in the unfolding pathways as @xmath1 is varied , which can not be obtained using pulling experiments .",
    "we obtain structures of the transition state ensembles ( tses ) , demonstrating the change in the tse structures as @xmath1 is increased from a low to a high value .",
    "let us assume that the unfolding rate @xmath28 , as a function of a controllable external perturbation @xmath29 , can be measured .",
    "we assume that @xmath29 decreases the stability of the folded state linearly , as is the case in the pulling experiment with @xmath30 , the force applied at two points of the protein .",
    "however , the discussion below is quite general , and applies to any external parameter with a linear , additive contribution to the effective protein energy function . for a protein under force , the total free energy has the general form @xmath31 , with a force contribution @xmath32 , where @xmath16 is the end - to - end extension of the protein . here",
    ", @xmath33 is the free energy in the absence of applied tension , and the vector @xmath34 represents all the additional conformational degrees of freedom besides @xmath16 .    in the derivation below , we model the dynamics of the protein as diffusion of a single particle on the multidimensional landscape @xmath35 .",
    "the unfolding of the protein would correspond to the particle starting in the reference protein conformation @xmath36 in the folded state energy basin f and diffusing to any other conformation , with a given extension @xmath37 , representing the unfolded basin u ( fig .",
    "the unfolding time for a particular trajectory is the time when the particle reaches the target conformation for the first time ( known as first passage time ) . averaging this time over all trajectories yields the mean first passage time ( mfpt ) from the unfolded to folded state which we denote as @xmath38 , or the average unfolding time .",
    "the unfolding rate is the inverse of the unfolding time , @xmath39 .",
    "we are interested in finding the curvature of @xmath2 as a function of @xmath1 , and in particular the sign of @xmath40 .",
    "starting from the diffusion equation , we find expressions for the mfpt from any conformation with extension @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and then for @xmath2 and its first two derivatives .",
    "it turns out that if we use the assumptions of a single unfolding pathway , the second derivative is negative and the curvature of @xmath24 $ ] has to be downward .",
    "the summary of the subsequent derivation is as follows : 1 ) we start from the equation for @xmath42 which can be obtained from the diffusion equation@xcite , 2 ) integrate it over the @xmath43 degrees of freedom , 3 ) use two assumptions for evaluating the integral with @xmath42 inside , 4 ) solve the ode for the unfolding time , 5 ) establish that the solution implies certain constraints on the shape of the [ @xmath27 plot . following this derivation in detail is not necessary for understanding the other parts of the paper .",
    "the equation that the mfpt @xmath44 can be obtained from the diffusion equation ( in fokker - planck form ) by integration over @xmath16,@xmath45 , and @xmath46 , followed by some rearrangements @xcite .",
    "the result is called the backward kolmogorov equation :    @xmath47\\right\\ } + \\\\ d(x,{\\mathbf{r } } ) e^{\\beta u(x,{\\mathbf{r}},f ) } \\left\\{\\nabla_{{\\mathbf{r } } } \\cdot \\left[e^{-\\beta u(x,{\\mathbf{r}},f ) } \\nabla_{{\\mathbf{r } } } t_\\text{u}(x,{\\mathbf{r}},f)\\right]\\right\\}=-1 , \\end{split}\\ ] ]    with the boundary condition @xmath48 , with @xmath49 and @xmath50 being the diffusion constant , which for generality is allowed to depend on the conformation . by dividing both sides of eq .   by @xmath51 and integrating over",

    "we rewrite eq .",

    "further simplification of the mfpt expression depends on the nature of the multidimensional free energy @xmath56 .",
    "in particular , we define a class of free energies that satisfy the following two conditions :    1 .",
    "@xmath56 has a single minimum with respect to @xmath34 at each point @xmath16 in the range @xmath57 to @xmath58 .",
    "we denote the location of this minimum as @xmath59 .",
    "the boltzmann factor @xmath60 for @xmath34 near @xmath59 is sharply peaked , so the thermodynamic contribution from conformations with coordinates far from @xmath59 is negligible . in other words , we assume fast equilibration along the @xmath34 coordinates at each @xmath16 , compared to the timescale of first passage between n and u.    a schematic illustration of a @xmath56 satisfying these requirements is shown in fig .",
    "diffusion is essentially confined to a single , narrow reaction pathway in the multidimensional space .",
    "we will call any @xmath56 in this category weakly multidimensional ( wmd ) with respect to @xmath16 , since the diffusion process is quasi-1d in terms of the reaction coordinate @xmath16 .",
    "in contrast , any @xmath56 that violates either one of the above conditions will be called strongly multidimensional ( smd ) , since it has characteristics that qualitatively distinguish it from any one - dimensional diffusion process .",
    "note that this categorization makes no other assumptions about the shape of @xmath56 except for those specified above : for example , there could be one or many free energies barriers separating n and u , or none at all .",
    "[ ws]b and c show two examples of @xmath56 that are smd . in both cases ,",
    "condition 1 is violated , because in the range @xmath61 there is no unique minimum in @xmath56 along @xmath34 . for panel b , there are two possible reaction pathways between n and u , while for panel c there is a single pathway , but it is non - monotonic in @xmath16 .    for an energy landscape that is wmd , there are rigorous bounds on the first and second derivatives of @xmath62 with respect to @xmath1 . to derive these bounds , note",

    ", we can now state the full criterion for the validity of wmd for describing force - induced unfolding :      the unfolding rate @xmath96 on a wmd free energy landscape under applied force @xmath1 must satisfy : @xmath97 if @xmath96 fails to satisfy either of the conditions in eq.[d11 ] , the underlying free energy landscape must be strongly multidimensional , and analyses of the measured data using the end - to - end distance , @xmath16 , as a reaction coordinate are incorrect .",
    "a range of behaviors in [ @xmath27 plots can be obtained depending on the nature of the energy landscape .",
    "stochastic simulations in a wmd ( figs.[ws]a and d ) show that [ @xmath27 has a minor downward curvature , which is readily explained by a generalized bell model in which the transition state location is allowed to move towards the folded state in accord with the hammond effect@xcite .",
    "in contrast , in the smd ( figs.[ws]b , c and e , f ) the [ @xmath27 plot shows upward curvature . the upward curvature in fig.[ws]e indicates loss of flux from the folded state through two channels in fig.[ws]b , similar to parallel pathways in protein unfolding experiments .",
    "interestingly , the upward curvature in fig.[ws]f from the smd landscape in fig.[ws]c does not come from parallel pathways . instead , the lifetime of the folded state first increases followed by the usual decrease as @xmath1 increases .",
    "such a counterintuitive `` catch bond '' behavior is well documented in a number of protein complexes@xcite .",
    "the results in figs .",
    "[ ws]e and [ ws]f show that violations of eq.[d11 ] implies that the underlying energy landscape must be smd .      using the data generated by molecular dynamics simulations of force unfolding the src sh3 domain , with force applied to residues 9 and 59 , for a set of forces @xmath98 , we calculated @xmath99 for each force @xmath100 as the inverse of the mean first passage time from the folded state to the unfolded state , by averaging the set of first passage times to unfolding @xmath101 over the trajectory index @xmath102 ( see methods ) .",
    "the [ @xmath25 plot for @xmath1-induced unfolding is non - linear with upward curvature implying that the free energy landscape is smd ( fig.[fig : twoslopes]b ) .",
    "we note parenthetically that the inadequacy of the bell model can not be fixed using movement of the transition state with @xmath1 or using a one - dimensional free energy profile with two ( or more ) barriers .",
    "remarkably , the slope change in the simulations qualitatively coincides with measurements on the same protein@xcite , where constant force was applied to the residues 7 and 59 .",
    "thus , both simulations and experiment show that the condition in eq.[d11 ] is violated , implying that the free energy landscape for sh3 is smd .",
    "the observed @xmath103 dependence can be fit using a sum of two exponential functions@xcite , @xmath104 the parameters @xmath105 and @xmath106 ( unfolding rates at @xmath21 ) and @xmath107 and @xmath108 ( putative locations of the transition states ) can be precisely extracted using maximum likelihood estimation ( mle , see methods ) . according to the akaike information criterion@xcite , the double exponential model is significantly more probable than the single - exponential model , for both simulations ( relative likelihood of the models @xmath109 ) and experiments@xcite ( @xmath110 ) .",

    "these comparisons show that the simulations based on the self - organized polymer with side - chains(sop - sc ) model reproduce quantitatively the shape of the [ @xmath2 ] plot . because simulations are done by coarse - graining the degrees of freedom , involving both solvent and proteins ,",
    "the @xmath0 from simulations are expected to be larger than the measured values with the discrepancy being greater at higher forces .",
    "our previous work@xcite showed that the unfolding rate in denaturants is larger by a factor of @xmath118 150 , which is similar to the difference between experiment and simulations in fig.[fig : twoslopes ] .",
    "however , because the inference about parallel pathways relies solely on the shape of @xmath2 the inability to quantitatively reproduce the precise value of @xmath0 is irrelevant .    despite the good fits to eq.[eq:2exp ] neither @xmath107 nor @xmath108 can be associated with transition state location as is traditionally assumed .",
    "we show below that such projections onto a one dimensional coordinate cease to have physical meaning when the underlying folding landscape is smd .",
    "the apparent barriers to unfolding at @xmath21 along the pathways can be estimated using @xmath119 and @xmath120 . using the accepted estimates for the prefactor ( @xmath121)@xcite , and the values of @xmath105 and @xmath106 from the fits of experimental data ( table [ tbl : fitparams ] ) , we obtain @xmath122 , depending on the value of @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "if these values are reasonable then the ratio of fluxes through the two pathways at @xmath21 is @xmath125 , which is much smaller than those obtained in the simulations by direct calculation of the flux through the two pathways .",
    "in addition , the finding that @xmath126 also makes no physical sense , because we expect the molecule under higher tension to be more brittle @xcite .",
    "these are the first indications that the fits using eq.[eq:2exp ] do not provide meaningful parameters .      in order to provide a structural interpretation of the smd nature of @xmath1-induced unfolding of src sh3",
    ", we followed the changes in several variables describing the conformations of sh3 as force is applied to residues 9 and 59 is varied in the sop - sc simulations .",
    "most of these are derived from measures assessing the extent to which structures of various parts of the protein overlap with the conformation in the native state .",
    "the structural overlap @xmath127 for two parts of the protein @xmath128 and @xmath129 is the fraction of broken native contacts between @xmath128 and @xmath129@xcite , @xmath130 where the summation is over the coarse - grained beads belonging to the parts @xmath128 and @xmath129 , @xmath131 is the number of contacts between @xmath128 and @xmath129 in the native state , @xmath132 is the heaviside function , @xmath133 is the tolerance in the definition of a contact , and @xmath134 and @xmath135 , respectively , are the coordinates of the beads in a given conformation @xmath136 and the native state .",
    "two of the most relevant sets of contacts in the forced - rupture of sh3 are the ones between the n - terminal ( @xmath137 ) and c - terminal ( @xmath138 ) @xmath6-strands ( fig.[fig : twoslopes]a ) , computed using the structural overlap , @xmath139 ; and contacts between the rt - loop ( residues 15 to 31 ) and the protein core ( strands @xmath140 and @xmath141 , residues 42 to 57 ) quantified by @xmath142 .",
    "when these structural elements unravel the structural overlap values become close to unity , signaling the global unfolding of the sh3 domain .    depending on @xmath1 , in some trajectories the rt - loop ruptures from the protein first ( @xmath142 sharply approaches 1 ) , followed by the break between @xmath137 and @xmath138 strands ( @xmath143 ) . in other trajectories ,",
    "the order is opposite , with @xmath144 sheet melting first , without the rt - loop rupture ( fig.s1).the calculated the fraction , @xmath145 , of trajectories that unravel through rupture of the rt - loop pathway depends strongly on force , suggesting that these are the two major pathways responsible for the change in the slope of the [ @xmath26 plot ( fig.[fig : snapshot]c ) . at low forces ( 15 pn ) @xmath146 implying that @xmath147 of the trajectories unfold through the rt - loop pathway , and this fraction decreases monotonically to @xmath148 at 45 pn .",

    "in order to further illustrate that the slope change in fig.[fig : twoslopes ] is due to the switching of the unfolding routes between the particular pathways discussed above , we created an _ in silico _",
    "mutant by adding a disulfide bond between the rt - loop and @xmath141 ( mimicking a potential experiment with l24c / g54c mutant ) . in the crosslink mutant , the enhanced stability of the rt - loop to the protein core blocks the @xmath149 unfolding pathway",
    "we generated six 1500 ms unfolding trajectories at 15 pn and did not observe unfolding in any of them , thus obtaining an estimate for the upper bound of unfolding rate of @xmath150 s@xmath151 for this mutant . comparing this unfolding rate to the rate at 15 pn for the wild - type ( without the disulfide bridge ) of 5.2",
    "s@xmath151 shows that blocking of the pathway decreases the average unfolding rate at 15 pn .",
    "the mutant simulations with the disulfide bridge suggests that the rtl pathway plays a major role at low forces , and the unfolding through the @xmath144 pathways is much slower at low force .",
    "furthermore , these simulations also show that rupture of the protein through the @xmath144 pathway occurs at a very slow rate at low forces even when the unfolding flux along the rtl pathway is muted . taken together these simulations",

    "to examine the effect of point mutations , we calculated @xmath0 as a function of @xmath1 for the v61a mutant . in the laser optical trapping ( lot ) experiments , v61a mutant does not show upward curvature in the same force range , and the [ @xmath26 plot in that range is linear .",
    "however , the curvature can be seen at lower forces . in simulations ,",
    "we observe the same qualitative change with respect to the wild - type upon mutation ( fig.[fig : v61a ] ) .",
    "if only data for forces above 15 pn is taken into account , the single exponential model becomes slightly more likely than the double exponential , but inclusion of the lower forces data shows double exponential , with pathway switching coming at a lower force than for wt .",
    "the fraction of trajectories going through the rt - loop pathway decreases compared to the wild - type ( i.e. @xmath152 for all @xmath1 ) ( fig . [ fig : v61a]c ) .",
    "the loss of upward curvature in the force range above 15 pn can be explained by the more prominent role of the @xmath144 pathway at low forces , leading to lesser degree of switching between the pathways .",
    "the v61a mutation is in the @xmath138 strand , making interactions between @xmath137 and @xmath138 weaker thus enabling the sheet to rupture more readily .",
    "parenthetically we note that this is a remarkable result , considering that change in the sop - sc force field is only minimal , which further illustrates that our model also captures the effect of point mutations .",
    "let us assume that the free energy landscape projected onto extension as the reaction coordinate accurately captures the @xmath1-dependent unfolding kinetics . in this case",
    ", we expect the bell model or its variation would hold , and @xmath16 ( assumed to be @xmath1-independent ) obtained from the fitting to that model would be the distance to the transition state with respect to the folded state @xmath153 .",
    "if the underlying free energy landscape were smd it is still possible to formally construct a 1d free energy profile using experimental@xcite or simulation data .",
    "it is tempting to associate the distances in the projected 1d profiles with transition state locations with respect to the folded state , as is customarily done in analyzing smfs data .",
    "such an interpretation suggests that @xmath107 and @xmath108 should correspond to the distances to the two transition states in the two pathways , with @xmath153 increasing with force in an apparent anti - hammond behavior . to assess",

    "it turns out , that @xmath153 decreases rather than increases with force , demonstrating the normally expected hammond behavior ( fig.[fig : umbsam ] ) , as force destabilizes the native state@xcite(see discussion section ) .",
    "we now demonstrate that @xmath107 and @xmath108 can not be identified with transition state locations by calculating the committor probability , @xmath154 @xcite , the fraction of trajectories that reach the folded state before the unfolded state starting from @xmath107 or @xmath108 .",
    "if @xmath107 and @xmath108 truly correspond to distances to transition states then @xmath155@xcite , i.e. , the transition state ensemble(tse ) should correspond to structures that have equal probability of reaching folded or unfolded state , starting from @xmath107 or @xmath108 . in sharp contrast to this expectation ,",
    "the states with @xmath107 are visited hundreds of time before unfolding ( see fig.s3 ) , which means @xmath156 .",

    "the explicit tse calculations confirm that the tses are similar to those found in unfolding trajectories with @xmath168 and @xmath139 .",

    "the top of the free energy barrier corresponds to a transition state .",
    "besides determining the structures of the unfolded and folded states , one of the main goals in protein folding is to identify the transition state ensemble , and characterize the extent of its heterogeneity . when viewed within the chemical reaction framework , the hammond postulate provides a qualitative description of the structure of the transition state if it is unique .",
    "the hammond postulate states _ _ `` if two states , as , for example , a transition state and an unstable intermediate , occur consecutively during a reaction process and have nearly the same energy content , their interconversion will involve only a small reorganization of the molecular structure''__@xcite .",
    "a corollary of the hammond postulate is that the ts structure likely resembles the least stable species in the folding reaction .    to apply the hammond postulate to a protein free energy landscape , perturbed by @xmath1 ,",
    "let us assume that at @xmath176 the states @xmath177 and @xmath178 , with equal free energy , are separated by a transition state .",

    ", the transition state should move towards the state that is destabilized by @xmath1@xcite , in accord with hammond behavior .",
    "if the opposite were to happen it could be an indication of anti - hammond behavior .    in a one - dimensional energy landscape , the distance between a minimum and a barrier is reflected in the slope of the [ @xmath180 plot ( @xmath181 value for [ @xmath182 ) , [ c]$ ] ] ) , which follows from the arrhenius law and linear coupling in the free energy .",
    "hammond behavior for the unfolding rate would mean movement of the transition state towards the folded state resulting in the decreasing of the slope of the [ @xmath27 plot with @xmath1 .",
    "hence , the temptation to refer to the opposite change of slope ( i.e. increasing with @xmath1 ) as anti - hammond behavior is natural .",
    "however , since the increase of the slope of the [ @xmath26 plot necessarily means , that the energy landscape is smd , referring to movement of the transition state along a single reaction coordinate is not meaningful .",
    "hence , the term `` anti - hammond '' behavior in this case does not reflect the opposite of hammond postulate in either the original formulation or according to the notion of the transition state .",
    "moreover , even if the energy landscape is formally projected onto the reaction coordinate to which the parameter ( @xmath1 or @xmath4 $ ] ) is coupled ( which is possible even in the smd case albeit without much physical sense ) , the movement of the transition state on this formal 1d landscape will still obey the hammond postulate .",
    "such a conclusion follows from a taylor expansion of the first derivative of the perturbed ( by @xmath1 or @xmath4 $ ] ) free - energy profile @xmath183 around the barrier top ( @xmath153 ) , @xmath184 where @xmath185 and @xmath186 are the free energy profile and transition state position at @xmath21 . since @xmath187 and @xmath188",

    "our conclusion holds for any perturbation @xmath1 which is linearly coupled to the energy function , and which monotonically destabilizes the folded state .",
    "thus , we surmise that upward curvature in [ @xmath27 or [ @xmath23 ) , [ c]$ ] ] plots are not equivalent to anti - hammond behavior .",
    "we note here , though the linear coupling of @xmath1 to the protein hamiltonian is exact , the perturbation by denaturant is approximate , although the leading order in @xmath4 $ ] is linear .    a similar conclusion , that is , a connection between upward curvature and multidimensionality , has been drawn analytically before , in the context of mechanochemistry of small molecules , based on the taylor expansion of the bell s model , similar to eq.[eq : taylorbarrier]@xcite . in our work",

    "we also solved directly for the quantity we are interested in , i.e. sign of @xmath191 , rather than movements of the transition state .",
    "connecting the latter to the curvature of the rate requires some additional steps , which might require more assumptions .",

    "however , for the [ @xmath23),[c]$ ] ] plots with upward curvature @xmath194 and @xmath195 may not correspond to the sasas of the respective transition states of the pathways just as we have shown that the extracted @xmath107 and @xmath108 should not be interpreted as tse locations at low and high @xmath1 , respectively . in addition",
    ", although the @xmath196 for the wild type is consistent with the expected value for @xmath6-sheet proteins with the i27 size , the @xmath197 seems unphysical .",
    "this observation combined with fairly high ratios of @xmath198 from a double exponential fit@xcite ( table s1 ) suggests that although the double exponential model above fits the data , inferring the nature of the tse requires entirely new set of experiments along the lines reported by clarke and coworkers @xcite .",

    "we have proven that upward curvature in the unfolding rates as a function of a perturbation , which is linearly coupled to the energy function describing a protein in a solvent , implies that the underlying energy landscape is strongly multidimensional .",
    "the observation of upward curvature in the [ @xmath26 plots also implies that unfolding occurs by multiple pathways . in the case of @xmath1-induced unfolding of sh3 domain",
    "this implies that there is a continuous decrease in the flux of molecules that reach the unfolded state through the low force pathway as @xmath1 increases .",
