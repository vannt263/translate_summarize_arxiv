    "the structure and spectra of atoms , spatially confined by various types of confinements whose sizes are commensurable with an atomic size , have seized the attention of theorists starting since early days @xcite to now , see review papers @xcite as well as some of the latest works on the subject @xcite and references therein .",
    "this is because a confined atom concept provides insights into various aspects of interdisciplinary significance @xcite .",
    "the most illustrative examples , perhaps , could be atoms under high pressure , quantum dots and endohedral fullerenes @xmath5@c@xmath6 . to date , numerous aspects of the structure and spectra of atoms under various kinds of confinements - impenetrable , open boundaries , spheroidal , conoidal , deby , c@xmath6-like,_etc . _ - have been attacked from many different angles by research teams world - wide @xcite ( and references therein ) .",
    "the present paper reports on novel discoveries made , specifically , for the structure of semifilled shell atoms under confinement .",
    "the latter is simulated by a repulsive penetrable spherical potential of an adjustable inner radius @xmath0 . in such atoms ,",
    "spectacular confinement induced effects termed orbital breathing , fusion , fission , and re - ordering with changing @xmath0 have been unravelled . semifilled shell atoms from the second , third and fourth rows of mendeleev s table - li( ... @xmath7 ) , n( ...",
    "@xmath8 ) , p( ... @xmath9 ) and cr( ...",
    "@xmath10@xmath11 ) - are chosen for completeness of the case study .",
    "atomic units ( a.u . ) are used throughout the paper unless specified otherwise .    when a multielectron atom is placed inside a repulsive spherical potential of an inner radius @xmath0 , finite height @xmath12 and width @xmath13",
    ", its electrons necessarily move in an effective double - well potential , even if the original atomic potential was single - welled .",
    "a problem of the thus confined multielectron atom brings together two distinct brunches of research in atomic physics . on the one hand",
    ", it features peculiarities of the structure of electronic subshells in the field of a double - well potential . on the other hand ,",
    "it studies how multielectron atoms may react to the presence of confinement .",
    "both of these outstanding topics have attracted much attention of researchers from the early to modern days .",
    "thus , for double - well potential studies - see the original work by goeppert - mayer @xcite and corresponding comprehensive review by connerade @xcite . for confined atoms",
    "- refer to the above referenced papers @xcite and references therein .",
    "the impetus for the present study stems from a recent work @xcite on the ground and excited states of the hydrogen atom confined inside a repulsive spherical potential @xmath14 of an inner radius @xmath0 , finite height @xmath12 and width @xmath13 .",
    "addition of @xmath14 to the hydrogen potential @xmath15 resulted in a double - well effective potential @xmath16 of the atom .",
    "the binding strengths of the inner and outer wells were controlled by decreasing @xmath0 .",
    "it was shown that the binding strength of @xmath17 alters in favour of the outer well at @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is a certain critical radius . as a result ,",
    "e.g. , the radius of the @xmath20 orbital suddenly increased from only @xmath21 at @xmath22 to @xmath23 at @xmath24 , at certain @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the discovered effect was termed _",
    "atomic swelling upon compression_. it was found to alter drastically not only the size and @xmath25 energy of the h(@xmath26 ) atom but its oscillator strengths @xmath27 as well , either almost extinguishing or drastically increasing @xmath27 depending on @xmath0 .    the above findings naturally make one to wonder how a multielectron atom might behave under the same kind of confinement .",
    "the present paper satisfies such curiosity .",
    "it is uncovered , in the performed study , that particularly semifilled shell atoms behave utterly spectacular under said confinement .",
    "it is the ultimate aim of this paper to demonstrate that , as the radius @xmath0 of confinement is changing , these atoms may develop such effects as orbital breathing ( alternate swelling and collapse of an orbital with changing @xmath0 ) , orbital fusion ( both energies and radial functions of two orbitals become equal through a certain range of @xmath0 values ) , orbital fission ( the two fused together orbitals separate once again through a certain different range of @xmath0 ) , as well as orbital re - ordering ( the order of orbitals in the atom changes with decreasing @xmath0 ) .",
    "a convenient way to calculate the structure of a semifilled shell atom is provided by a ` spin - polarized ' hartree - fock ( sphf ) approximation @xcite .",
    "sphf was successfully applied by the author of this paper and his colleagues to said atoms on numerous occasions to date , see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein .",
    "the quintessence of sphf is as follows .",
    "it accounts for the fact that spins of all electrons in a semifilled subshell of the atom are co - directed , in accordance with hund s rule , conditionally - all pointing upward ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "this results in splitting of a closed @xmath29 subshell in the atom into two semifilled subshells of opposite spin orientations , @xmath30@xmath28 and @xmath30@xmath31 , due to the presence of exchange interaction between @xmath32@xmath28 electrons with only spin - up electrons in the semifilled subshell(s ) of the atom but absence of such for @xmath32@xmath31 electrons .",
    "thus , atoms of concern of this paper - li , n , p and cr - have the following sphf configurations : li(@xmath33@xmath28@xmath34@xmath31@xmath1@xmath28 ) , n(@xmath33@xmath28@xmath33@xmath31@xmath1@xmath28@xmath1@xmath31@xmath2@xmath28 ) , p(@xmath33@xmath28@xmath33@xmath31@xmath1@xmath28@xmath1@xmath31@xmath2@xmath28@xmath2@xmath31@xmath35@xmath28@xmath35@xmath31@xmath3@xmath28 ) and cr( ... @xmath3@xmath28@xmath3@xmath31@xmath4@xmath28@xmath36@xmath28 ) .",
    "sphf equations for semifilled shell atoms differ from ordinary hf equations for closed shell atoms by accounting for the exchange interaction only between electrons with the same spin orientation ( @xmath28,@xmath28 or @xmath31,@xmath31 ) .    as for a semifilled shell atom confined inside a spherical potential @xmath37 ,",
    "its orbital radial functions @xmath38 and one - electron energies @xmath39 are the solutions of a system of _ modified _ radial sphf equations which account for the presence of @xmath37 in addition to the purely atomic sphf potential : @xmath40p_{n\\ell\\uparrow}(r ) = \\epsilon_{n\\ell\\uparrow}p_{n\\ell\\uparrow}(r ) \\cr [ \\hat{h}^{r } + u_{\\rm c}(r)]p_{n\\ell\\downarrow}(r ) = \\epsilon_{n\\ell\\downarrow}p_{n\\ell\\downarrow}(r)}\\right\\}. \\label{hf}\\ ] ] here , @xmath41 is a radial part of the non - local sphf hamiltonian which , naturally , is identical to that for a free atom . in this paper , as was specified above , the confining potential @xmath37 is defined by @xmath42 where @xmath12 , @xmath0 and @xmath13 are its height , inner radius and thickness , respectively . as in @xcite",
    ", the height @xmath12 and thickness @xmath13 of the potential will be fixed at @xmath43 and @xmath44 , just for the sake of certainty .",
    "the author believes that calculated data for a confined phosphorous atom are most illustrative with respect to confinement induced effects emerging in semifilled shell atoms .",
    "therefore , let us discuss calculated data for confined phosphorous in the first head .",
    "sphf calculated data for the free and confined phosphorous atoms are depicted in figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] which illustrate all the unravelled effects .",
    "notice ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) how @xmath45 of the @xmath46@xmath31 orbital first drastically decreases from @xmath47 ev at @xmath48 to only @xmath49 ev at @xmath50 , then significantly increases to @xmath51 ev at @xmath52 , then , once again , drastically decreases to @xmath53 ev at @xmath54 , after which it remains about constant at lower values of the confining radius @xmath0 .",
    "the energy variations are accompanied by variations in the size ( radius ) of the @xmath46@xmath31 orbital , as clearly follows from figure [ fig2 ] where the radial function @xmath55 is plotted for selected values of @xmath0 .",
    "indeed , one can see that the @xmath46@xmath31 orbital first dramatically swells ( in terms of work @xcite ) in size at @xmath56 , where the most likely value of its radius is @xmath57 versus of only @xmath58 in the free atom , then significantly collapses to @xmath59 at @xmath60 and considerably swells once again to @xmath61 at @xmath62 , after which it remains about the same at smaller values of @xmath0 .",
    "the emerging variations in @xmath63 and alternate contractions and expansions of @xmath55 with changing confining radius @xmath0 are clearly indicative of _ orbital ` breathing ' _ - one of the novel effect discovered in the present work .    also , notice ( figure [ fig1 ] ) how the @xmath39 energies of confined phosphorous are alternately increasing and decreasing with changing @xmath0 even though corresponding @xmath64@xmath28@xmath31 orbitals remain either spatially swollen or collapsed , at given values of @xmath0 .",
    "this is an interesting observation by itself .",
    "for example , one can count seven oscillations in the energy of the @xmath65@xmath28 orbital as @xmath0 is changing from @xmath48 to @xmath66 .",
    "furthermore , notice ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) how the one - electron energies @xmath67 and @xmath63 , which are normally much different from each other ( e.g. , @xmath68 ev whereas @xmath69 ev at @xmath48 ) , become the same , to an excellent approximation , in the whole interval of @xmath70 .",
    "not only @xmath71 in the specified values of the confining radius @xmath0 , but the radial functions @xmath72 and @xmath55 as well .",
    "this is illustrated by figure [ fig2](c ) , where @xmath72 and @xmath55 are plotted for a selected value of @xmath73 .",
    "moreover , calculated data ( not presented in the paper ) showed that the same is true for all other spin - up and spin - down orbitals @xmath64@xmath28 and @xmath64@xmath31 as well , at given @xmath70 .",
    "the emerging equivalence of one - electron energies ( @xmath74 ) and radial functions ( @xmath75 ) of @xmath64@xmath28 and @xmath64@xmath31 orbitals in a certain range of values of @xmath0 is indicative of _ orbital ` fusion ' _ , where each of two individual entities - @xmath76@xmath28 and @xmath76@xmath31 subshells - turn into a single entity - a @xmath77 subshell .",
    "correspondingly , the electron configuration of the phosphorous atom with mutually fused spin - up and spin - down orbitals becomes p(@xmath78 ) , as in a standard hf theory .",
    "orbital fusion is precisely another of the novel effects discovered in the present work .",
    "the physics behind of orbital fusion becomes clear when one explores figure [ fig2](c ) .",
    "one can see that the effect takes place when only the outermost semifilled @xmath3@xmath28 subshell of the atom swells into the outer well of the effective potential as a result of changing @xmath0 .",
    "when this happens , the most likely value of the radius of the @xmath3@xmath28 orbital increases from its ordinary value of @xmath79 in the inner well to @xmath80 in the outer well , whereas , in contrast , the radii of @xmath65@xmath28 and @xmath65@xmath31 orbitals both shrink to @xmath81 . because of huge differences between the radii of the swollen @xmath82@xmath28 and all other orbitals of the atom , exchange interaction of inner electrons with the outermost @xmath82@xmath28 electrons vanishes , to an excellent approximation",
    "this wipes off any differences between the energies and wavefunctions of inner @xmath64@xmath28 and @xmath64@xmath31 electrons with the same @xmath64 , for an obvious reason .",
    "thus , @xmath64@xmath28@xmath31 orbital fusion takes place in the confined atom , at specific values of @xmath0 .      as @xmath0 keeps decreasing , the binding strength of the inner well lessens whereas that of the outer well increases .",
    "correspondingly , the latter can support more and more orbitals , with decreasing @xmath0 .",
    "thus , e.g. , see figure [ fig2](d ) , as @xmath0 is decreased to @xmath54 , the outer well is capable of binding , and does bind , two orbitals - the @xmath65@xmath31 and @xmath83@xmath28 orbitals .",
    "it is , however , still not powerful enough to support the third orbital , @xmath65@xmath28 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath65@xmath28 and @xmath65@xmath31 orbitals , which were fused together in the range of @xmath70 , become split once again , both in terms of their radii and energies ( @xmath84 ev versus @xmath85 ev ) , at @xmath54 .",
    "this is indicative of confinement induced _ orbital fission _ which is another novel effect uncovered in the present work .",
    "it is important to underline that confinement induced orbital fission is qualitatively different from the cause of splitting of a @xmath29 subshell into spin - up @xmath86@xmath28 and spin - down @xmath86@xmath31 subshells suggested by the sphf theory alone .",
    "indeed , confinement induced orbital fission is exclusively due to orbital swelling of the @xmath65@xmath31 orbital but shrinking of the @xmath65@xmath28 orbital , whereas , in the sphf theory , the splitting is solely due to differences in exchange interaction of spin - up and spin - down electrons with only spin - up electrons in an unpaired semifilled subshell of the atom .",
    "confinement induced orbital fission is another novel effect uncovered in the present work .      as @xmath0",
    "is decreased to a yet smaller value , @xmath87 , even three - orbital swelling occurs , where the three @xmath3@xmath28 , @xmath65@xmath31 and @xmath83@xmath28 orbitals all swell from the inner well into the outer well of the effective potential , see figure [ fig2](e ) .",
    "the unravelled three - orbital swelling effect in a double - well potential is an interesting occurrence which was not ever noted in previous works on atomic structures in double - well potentials , to the best of the author s knowledge .",
    "note , in the discussed case of three - orbital swelling , the @xmath65@xmath28 and @xmath65@xmath31 orbitals are split , both in terms of their radial functions ( figure [ fig2](e ) ) and energies : @xmath88 ev versus @xmath89 ev , see figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "this time , the splitting is in full accord with the sphf theory - it is due to the presence / absence of exchange interaction between the @xmath65@xmath28/@xmath65@xmath31 and @xmath90@xmath28 electrons in the atom which is now not a negligible effect , because the radii of these three orbitals are about the same .",
    "finally , notice ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) how the order of the @xmath65@xmath28 , @xmath65@xmath31 and @xmath90@xmath28 subshells ( orbitals ) relative to their energies @xmath67 , @xmath63 and @xmath91 alters with changing @xmath0 from ( @xmath92@xmath28 , @xmath92@xmath31 , @xmath3@xmath28 ) at @xmath93 ( the same as in the free atom ) to ( @xmath92@xmath28 , @xmath3@xmath28 , @xmath92@xmath31 ) at @xmath94 , to ( @xmath95 , @xmath3@xmath28 ) at @xmath96 and back to ( @xmath92@xmath28 , @xmath3@xmath28 , @xmath92@xmath31 ) at @xmath97 .",
    "such confinement induced multiple re - ordering of orbitals in the atomic structure is one more important novel effect discovered in the present work .",
    "the knowledge of shell ordering is fundamental to chemistry , because it determines the electronic properties of atoms , such , for example , as valence .",
    "sphf calculated data for one - electron energies @xmath39 and orbital radial function @xmath38 of free and confined nitrogen versus the confining radius are depicted in figures [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] .",
    "they reveal similar effects of orbital breathing , fusion , fission and re - ordering as in the above discussed confined phosphorous atom .",
    "notice ( figure [ fig3 ] ) , how the @xmath98@xmath28 and @xmath98@xmath31 orbitals fuse together in the range of @xmath99 but separate at @xmath100 , how the subshell ordering ( @xmath101@xmath28 , @xmath101@xmath31 , @xmath2@xmath28 ) at @xmath102 changes to ( @xmath101@xmath28 , @xmath2@xmath28 , @xmath101@xmath31 ) at @xmath103 , to ( @xmath2@xmath28 , @xmath104 ) at @xmath105 ( @xmath98@xmath28@xmath31 spin - orbitals fuse together and become outermost ) , to ( @xmath104 , @xmath2@xmath28 ) at @xmath106 ( @xmath98@xmath28@xmath31 spin - orbitals remain fused together ) and to ( @xmath107@xmath28 , @xmath108@xmath28 , @xmath107@xmath31 ) at @xmath109 .",
    "also notice orbital fusion of the @xmath110@xmath28 and @xmath110@xmath31 orbitals at @xmath111 . furthermore ,",
    "notice ( figure [ fig4 ] ) orbital breathing of the @xmath107@xmath31 orbital as @xmath0 changes from @xmath112 to @xmath105 ( the orbital swells in size ) , then to @xmath113 ( the orbital collapses ) and to @xmath66 ( the orbital swells in size ) .",
    "orbital breathing is also inherent to the @xmath107@xmath28 orbital of the atom .",
    "for the lithium atom , sphf calculated data ( see figure [ fig5 ] ) reveal orbital swelling only of the outermost @xmath101@xmath28 orbital , at @xmath114 .",
    "the implication is that the outer well of the confined li atomic effective potential is not strong enough to make a @xmath115@xmath28@xmath31 electron , or essentially _ all _ electrons of the atom , to move far away from the nucleus into the outer well of the potential and remain bound . at @xmath114 ,",
    "when the @xmath107@xmath28 orbital swells into the outer well of the potential , exchange interaction between the innermost @xmath115@xmath28 electron and the very far distanced outermost @xmath101@xmath28 electron ( both have the same spin orientation ) vanishes .",
    "this results in orbital fusion of the @xmath115@xmath28 and @xmath115@xmath31 orbitals , as is clearly demonstrated by figure [ fig5 ] .",
    "no orbital breathing , fission , or re - ordering was found to occur in the atom , though .",
    "calculated data for the @xmath116 and @xmath117 energies of confined cr versus @xmath0 are depicted in figures [ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] .    notice how @xmath117 and @xmath116 , which behaved identically until @xmath118 , start suddenly behaving oppositely at smaller values of @xmath0 .",
    "indeed , at @xmath119 , @xmath120 abruptly decreases from @xmath121 to @xmath122 ev , whereas , in contrast , @xmath123 increases in the same abrupt manner from @xmath124 ev to @xmath125 ev .",
    "this is indicative of sudden orbital swelling of the @xmath126@xmath28 orbital into the outer well of the effective potential but orbital contraction of the @xmath127@xmath28 orbital , at @xmath119 . indeed ,",
    "figure [ fig7 ] clearly demonstrates said behaviour of the @xmath126@xmath28 and @xmath127@xmath28 orbitals .",
    "the implication is that the outer well of the potential is not strong enough to accommodate the five @xmath127@xmath28 electrons in the well .",
    "as the @xmath128@xmath28 electron moves into the outer well , at @xmath119 , nuclear screening for the @xmath127@xmath28 orbital lessens , by virtue of which the attractive force of the nucleus on the orbital increases . this makes the @xmath127@xmath28 orbital to contract .",
    "interesting , however , is that the change in its energy is significant ( @xmath124 ev at @xmath129 versus @xmath130 ev at @xmath131 ) whereas the spatial contraction is somewhat not . at smaller values of @xmath0 , @xmath132 ,",
    "the energy of the @xmath126@xmath28 orbital is practically independent of @xmath0 .",
    "this is because , at @xmath133 , almost entire @xmath126@xmath28 electron density is accommodated in the outer well of the potential , so that the confining potential practically stops exerting any additional pressure on the @xmath126@xmath28 orbital , thereby leaving it unchanged with decreasing @xmath0 .",
    "in contrast , decreasing @xmath0 to values below @xmath134 starts somewhat noticeably pushing the @xmath127@xmath28 level upward the inner well once again ( moving it from @xmath125 ev to @xmath135 ev ) but keeps compressing the orbital itself .",
    "in this paper , a number of interesting effects in the behaviour of confined atoms has been uncovered , illustrated and interpreted .",
    "such effects as confinement induced orbital fusion an fission are characteristic features of specifically semifilled shell atoms .",
    "indeed , these effects take place for spin - up and spin - down subshells @xmath30@xmath28 and @xmath30@xmath31 with the same values of @xmath64 which originally are split ( both in the energy and radial coordinate ) due to differences in exchange interactions of electrons from these subshells with only spin - up electrons from an unpaired semifilled subshell @xmath136@xmath28 .",
    "when only the unpaired semifilled subshell @xmath136@xmath28 gets swollen into the outer well of the effective potential , its radius starts exceeding by far the radii of other subshells of the atom .",
    "therefore , exchange interaction of inner electrons with electrons from the swollen @xmath136@xmath28 subshell reduces to a zero , to an excellent approximation .",
    "correspondingly , @xmath30@xmath28 and @xmath30@xmath31 subshells fuse together into a single @xmath29 subshell .",
    "when , in addition to the @xmath137@xmath28 orbital , both the @xmath64@xmath28 and @xmath64@xmath31 orbitals swell into the outer well of the effective potential as well , the presence or absence of exchange interaction between @xmath137@xmath28 and @xmath64@xmath28 electrons , on the one hand , and @xmath137@xmath28 and @xmath64@xmath31 electrons , on the other hand , starts mattering again .",
    "this results in fission of the @xmath29 subshell into two separate subshells , @xmath30@xmath28 and @xmath30@xmath31 , in the outer potential well . clearly , the discussed effects are inherent to semifilled shell atoms . as for other effects - orbital breathing and",
    "re - ordering - the author does not see any principle obstacles for them to emerge in atoms with arbitrary filled subshells .",
    "in fact , orbital re - ordering was earlier predicted for a number of strongly compressed atoms under an impenetrable confinement @xcite .    in conclusion , possible objects , processes , problems and situations of ceratin relevance to the solved problem might be porous materials with atoms - intruders inside porous , or a problem of separation and diffusion of gas molecules through porous nano - carbon formations such , e.g. , as graphene or nanotubes @xcite where intriguing quantum sieving effects take place @xcite , as well as an atom , or atoms of a material , under pressure of powerful _ short _ laser pulses where , due to predicted in this paper confinement induced effects , absorption , emission , or scattering of radiation might take a much different route than that expected on the basis of the knowledge on interaction of radiation with free atoms .",
    "more knowledgeable and inventive researchers , than the author , could find or suggest more ways for a practical application of said effects .",
    "anyway , ratiocinating on this matter , the author s personal viewpoint on the primary value of the present work , at the given time instant , can be best represented by the following passage borrowed from work @xcite ( devoted to atoms confined inside impenetrable spheres ) : ` _ _ ... we regard the solutions as teaching us something about the subject , although such systems ... ( in the sense of dirac s famous remark ) pertain to philosophy rather than physics .",
    "... we should not be too worried by this aspect ... _ _ ' .",
