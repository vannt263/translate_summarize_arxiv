    "among numerous phases of two - dimensional electron gases ( 2deg ) , the even - denominator quantum hall states with the filling factors @xcite @xmath6 and @xmath7 are particularly interesting .",
    "in contrast to odd - denominator fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) liquids , they can not be explained by a straightforward generalization of the laughlin variational wave function . an early attempt to understand their nature led to the beautiful idea of non - abelian states of matter @xcite . in non - abelian systems , the types and positions of quasiparticles do not uniquely determine the quantum state .",
    "this results in unusual physics and may open a road to topological quantum computing @xcite . however , the existence of non - abelian quasiparticles has not been proven and the nature of the 5/2 state remains a puzzle .    both abelian and non - abelian",

    "one approach @xcite consists in the measurement of the tunneling current through a quantum point contact ( qpc ) between the edges of a 5/2 fqh liquid .",

    "1b , the gate widths are comparable to their distances from 2deg .",
    "the gates are considerably wider in fig . 1c .",

    "we want to connect these numbers with the nature of the topological order .    since the electric current is carried by the edges , the exponent @xmath9 depends on the edge physics near the qpc .",
    "the size of the relevant region near the point contact is set by the distance a charge can travel during the tunneling event : @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is the velocity of the edge excitation and @xmath105 is the duration of the tunneling event .",

    "let us look at the geometry of the edges within @xmath111 @xmath110 m from the qpc .",
    "the edges are defined by gates at the distance of 200 nm from 2deg .",
    "the widths of both gates in the geometry 1a and the upper gate in the geometry 1b have the same order of magnitude of hundreds nanometers @xcite .",
    "the width is 2200 nm for the lower gate in the geometry 1b and both gates in the geometry 1c .",
    "the distance between the edge channel segments on the opposite sides of a gate differs from its width . in our case",
    "there are several edge channels that can run at different locations .",
    "it is not easy to determine those locations . in particular , the annealing procedure used in refs",
    ". changes the device electrostatics but it is unclear what its effect on the geometry is .",
    "a crude estimate of the edge channel positions can be obtained from ref . .",
    "we find that the edge channels run within the distance of hundreds nanometers from the gates .",
    "this agrees with the upper bound one can derive from the gate geometry in fig .",
    "the tip of the upper gate is at 600 nm from the lower gate .",
    "the distance between the outermost edge channel and the gate is thus expected to be below 600/2 nm @xmath112 nm . we conclude that the gate width , the gate distance from 2deg and the distance between the edge modes on the opposite sides of the gate all have the same order of magnitude for both gates in the geometry 1a and the upper gate in the geometry 1b .",
    "this means that there is a significant unscreened coulomb interaction between the segments of the edge on the opposite sides of the gates . on the other hand , in the geometry 1c and for the lower gate in the geometry 1b",
    ", the width of the gates is close to the distance between the edge channels on their opposite sides and much greater than the gate distance from the 2deg plane .",
    "thus , we expect that the coulomb interaction across the gates is almost completely screened in the latter geometries .",
    "one can also neglect the electrostatic interaction between the edge channels defined by two different gates in all geometries .",
    "indeed , an edge point at the distance @xmath113 @xmath110 m from the tip of the gate is much further from the edge on the other side of the qpc than from the gate .        what is the effect of the electrostatic interaction across the gate on the tunneling current ?",
    "it is easy to see that repulsive coulomb interaction suppresses tunneling . indeed , after a tunneling event , the tunneling charge must move away from the qpc .",
    "due to the chiral transport on the quantum hall edge , it moves along segment oa in fig .",
    "2 . when the excess charge arrives at point a , it pushes charge from point b due to their repulsive electrostatic interaction . because of chirality the charge from point b can only move towards the tip o of the gate .",
    "thus , excess charge accumulates in point o. this means lower tunneling density of states than for a noninteracting system where charge rapidly distributes over a large region .",
    "hence , one expects higher values of the tunneling exponent @xmath9 in the geometries 1a and 1b than in the geometry 1c . this is exactly what has been observed .",
    "the lower edge has the same geometry in figs .",
    "1b and 1c and its tunneling density of states is described by the same exponent @xmath97 .",
    "the same exponent also describes the upper edge in fig",
    "thus , @xmath114 .",
    "the upper edge in the geometry 1b is described by a different exponent @xmath96 .",
    "hence , @xmath115 . if two identical gates of the same geometry as the upper gate in fig .",
    "1b were used in fig .",
    "1a then one would obtain @xmath116 .",
    "in such situation @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 form an arithmetic series .",
    "interestingly , this agrees with experiment . at the same time , device 1a was made in a different sample and its geometry details are different from the upper gate in fig .",
    "besides , the gate width changes linearly @xcite with the distance @xmath117 from the qpc at the distances @xmath118 in the geometry 1a .",
    "this means that the effective interaction strength depends on the temperature since it depends on the gate width at the distance @xmath119 .",
    "hence , there are corrections to the power law for the tunneling density of states in the geometry 1a .",
    "this may be a reason for a poor fit for the quasiparticle charge @xmath14 from the data in that geometry .",

    "those gates are @xmath120-shaped , as shown in fig .",
    "3 , with the width of the metal strips on the order of 200 nm .",
    "thus , each gate gives rise to two fqh edge channels inside and outside the gate .",
    "we are interested in the tunneling in the outer channel .",
    "its coulomb interaction with the inner channel affects the tunneling exponent @xmath9 .",
