    "* ) , a significant ( 3050% ) fraction of baryons is thought to reside in the form of gas in a ` warm - hot ' phase ( @xmath4  k ) , which is hard to detect with the instruments currently in operation .",
    "this warm - hot gas , whose density is @xmath5@xmath6 , is called the warm - hot intergalactic medium ( whim ) .",
    "the firm detection of the whim is important because it is the most promising candidate for the `` missing baryons '' ; i.e. , it is thought to explain the discrepancy between the baryon density observed in the local universe @xcite and that in the distant universe @xcite or that calculated from the observed fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background @xcite .",
    "the whim may be detected via emission or absorption lines from highly ionized elements in uv or x - ray spectra . given the relative elemental abundances ,  on the order of 0.1 to 0.3 of solar",

    "( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , their analysis shows that the baryon density in the temperature range @xmath7  k is about an order of magnitude lower than the expected whim level .",
    "therefore , most of the missing baryons seem to reside in a hotter phase at @xmath8  k , which can be probed with x - rays .",
    "there is only one sightline with a likely detection of the whim via o or o absorption lines so far @xcite .",
    "their results suggest that most of the missing baryons can be explained by the absorbing clouds inferred from their data .",
    "however , recent work by @xcite and @xcite showed that the detection with the chandra letgs by @xcite was not consistent with rgs observations of the same sight line .",
    "thus , the existence of the whim in the hotter phase is not yet confirmed .",
    "several possible detections of whim emission have been reported . and",
    "@xcite report the detection of redshifted o and o emission lines as well as soft x - ray ( @xmath9 ) excesses in the spectra of 7 clusters of galaxies out of 21 measured systems . @xcite also reported detection of o and o emission lines in the outskirts of the coma cluster .",
    "@xcite and takei et al.(2006 ) report not only emission lines in the spectrum of cluster outskirts but also absorption lines in the spectrum of a quasar behind the clusters , although the significance of the absorption measurement is not high ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "@xcite observed o features in the virgo cluster , while takei et al .",
    "( 2006 ) detected ne in the coma cluster .",
    "they estimated the path length of absorbing / emitting medium assuming that the absorber and the emitter are the same cloud , and concluded that the length scale of the medium exceeds the virial scale of the clusters .",
    "there are counterarguments against the discovery of o or o emission lines associated with clusters .",
    "for example , and @xcite concluded that some of the emission lines observed by are likely due to field - to - field variation of the soft x - ray background or galactic emission .",
    "such controversies occurred because the ccd instruments can not clearly distinguish o lines emitted by the gas associated with clusters of moderate redshift ( @xmath11 ) from those of galactic origin .",
    "these arguments suggest the importance of careful target selection and accurate measurement of background level .",
    "note that the observations of redshifted emission lines also give important clues to solve another mystery `` cluster soft excess '' , the excess emission in @xmath12 , reported since the 1990s in the extreme ultraviolet and the x - ray bands from _ euve _ and _ rosat _ ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "thus , the study of x - ray emission in cluster outskirts brings us important information about the cluster system itself and its environment .",
    "since there are only a few reports of possible emission lines from the whim , further sensitive study of other systems is desirable . in this paper , we report our observation of a2218 with the xis ( koyama et al .",
    "2006 ) onboard _ suzaku _ ( mitsuda et al .",
    "a2218 is a well - known cluster because of its strong gravitational lensing arcs .",
    "its redshift is 0.1756 @xcite , where one arcminute corresponds to 179 kpc with the cosmology we have adopted .",
    "the cluster is thought to be still in a dynamically young state  x - ray analysis suggests that the cluster core is not in hydrostatic equilibrium due to an ongoing or recent merger in the line - of - sight direction .",
    "the distribution of galaxy velocities based on the optical study of @xcite indicates substructure in the line of sight , and @xcite studied the mass structure in detail and have concluded that a2218 is unrelaxed .",
    "the dynamics of the cluster is considered to cause the discrepancy between the mass estimated from gravitational lensing and that determined from x - ray observations ; gravitational lensing indicates @xmath13 times higher mass than x - ray estimation for the central ( @xmath14 ) region .",
    "these observations indicate an elongated structure in the line - of - sight direction and suggests existence of a large - scale filament in this direction .",
    "if this is the case , we would expect a high surface brightness of the whim emission .",
    "the fairly large redshift of a2218 would also help us observe a significant energy shift of emission lines with the xis instrument .",
    "thus , a2218 seems to be one of the most suitable targets to search for the whim emission from suzaku .",
    "we assume a hubble constant of 70 km s@xmath15 mpc@xmath15 or @xmath16 and @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "the solar metal abundances used in this paper are given by @xcite . unless otherwise stated , errors in the figures are at the 68  % confidence level and at the 90  % confidence level in the text and tables",
    "we carried out four observations to study the warm - hot gas in the a2218 vicinity with the xis instrument onboard _",
    "suzaku _ : two on the cluster and two in offset regions whose locations are different from each other .",
    "the offset observations were performed to measure the foreground galactic contribution , which can produce a large ambiguity in the study of soft emission around clusters .",
    "[ fig : a2218rosatmap ] is a map of the _ rosat _ r4 band after removing bright point sources @xcite .",
    "this energy band is sensitive to o and o emission lines , which are strong in the galactic emission , and hence is suitable to study their fluctuations .",
    "we examined the _",
    "rosat _ map ( fig .",
    "[ fig : a2218rosatmap ] ) and selected the location of offset pointings so that the galactic emission level is similar to that in the vicinity of a2218 .",
    "also , the distance from a2218 is large ( @xmath19 or 10.7 mpc at the a2218 redshift ) , so the data from the offset regions should be free from the putative large - scale filament around a2218 .",
    "the observed locations are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : a2218rosatmap ] and table  [ tab : a2218position ] , as well as the position of a2218 .",
    "hereafter we call the four observations a2218 - 1 , a2218 - 2 , offset - a , and offset - b , respectively . a2218 - 1 and offset - a were observed in early october , 2005 , and the others in late october .",
    "the observation sequence numbers and dates are summarized in table  [ tab : a2218observation ] .",
    "the xis is an x - ray ccd camera , which consists of three front - illuminated ( fi ) sensors and one back - illuminated ( bi ) sensor .",
    "the camera covers the 0.212  kev energy band with an energy resolution of 130  ev at 5.9  kev and 40  ev at 0.5  kev .",
    "its field of view is a square of @xmath20 .",
    "the bi and fi sensors have different advantages : the former has higher quantum efficiency in the soft energy band , while the latter shows a lower internal background level .",
    "an important characteristic of the xis is the absence of a large low - energy tail in the pulse - height distribution function , even in the very soft energy ( @xmath21 ) band .",
    "those characteristics give the xis an excellent capability to study the low - energy emission lines , such as from the whim .",
    "after the launch of _ suzaku _ , a time and position dependent contamination of the xis optical blocking filter ( obf ) was found .",
    "the source is probably outgassing from the satellite .",
    "the level of contamination increases with time and is different from sensor to sensor .",
    "the time and position dependence of the contamination thickness has been empirically modeled by the xis team . at the time of our observations ,",
    "the effective area at 0.5  kev was on average 25% lower than that of the pre - launch calibration .",
    "see koyama et al .",
    "( 2006 ) for a fuller description of the instrument .",
    "the two observations of a2218 were 25 days apart , and the count rates at 0.5 kev were different by 9% and 13% for the bi and the combined fi sensors , respectively .",
    "this is consistent with the expected drop of 8% for both sensors within statistical errors .",

    "we removed flickering ccd pixels , which cause a large noise component below 0.5  kev .",
    "we also excluded apparent point sources that were found in the offset - a image .",
    "although the fluxes of these point sources were lower than the detection limit for the a2218 image , we removed them because we are interested in the upper limits of the soft excess emission .",
    "the spectra were then extracted in the annular region between @xmath25 and @xmath26 from the cluster center using xselect distributed in heasoft 6.0.4 .",
    "we define the cluster center as ( detx , dety ) = ( 499 , 530 ) in detector coordinates for all observations and all sensors .",
    "note that the boresight of all xis sensors coincide within @xmath27 .",
    "we have chosen the inner radius to be @xmath25 in order to exclude the bright central region , in which the strong emission of the hot icm hampers the study of warm - hot emission .",
    "we also excluded the region outside of @xmath26 because the position dependence of the contamination on the obf is not well known there .",
    "although the xis sensors are always illuminated by @xmath28fe calibration sources at the field edge , we did not remove these regions in the present analysis .    to estimate and subtract the internal background",
    ", we also extracted spectra from night earth observations distributed by the xis team .",
    "it is known that the variation of the internal background spectrum is well correlated with the cut - off rigidity ( cor ) at the position of the satellite ; the smaller the cor value is , the larger the background level becomes .",
    "to estimate accurately the internal background level , we collected events when the detector was looking at the dark earth ( night earth events ) and sorted them by cor .",
    "we extracted the spectrum for each @xmath29 interval of cor , and then added them weighted by exposure time for the respective cor range in the actual observation .",
    "this process gives different night earth spectra for the four observations , since the detailed distribution of cor was different among the observations .",
    "the background spectra were extracted from the same region in detector coordinates as the corresponding observation in order to avoid possible systematic effects due to positional variation of the detector background .",
    "we used response matrix files ( rmfs ) ae_xi[0123]_20060213(c).rmf distributed by the xis team for spectral fitting . on the other hand",
    ", we generated the ancillary response files ( arfs ) with the arf builder ` xissimarfgen ' , which is based on ray - tracing ( ishisaki et al .",
    "the change of the effective area with time in the soft x - ray energy range , due to the increase of obf contamination , was taken into account by the following method .",
    "the arfs were created separately for each observation , according to the observation date .",
    "we used the ae_xi[0123]_contami_20060525.fits contamination tables to model the composition and position dependence of the contaminant , in which the c / o ratio of contaminant was assumed to be 6 .",
    "note that the effective area for diffuse sources depends on the sky distribution of the flux , because the quantum efficiency varies with the detector position due to vignetting and contamination thickness .",
    "we adopted the suzaku xis image ( 1.04.0  kev ) of a2218 for the incident flux distribution , in which the two observations by the four sensors were all summed ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : a2218image ] ) .",
    "we assumed a uniform flux distribution for the offset pointings .    in the analysis shown below",
    ", the spectra and arfs for a2218 - 1 and a2218 - 2 were added using the ftools mathpha and addarf , respectively .",
    "further , the spectra and response ( rmfs and arfs ) of the three fi sensors were combined using ftools mathpha and marfrmf , respectively .",
    "we confirmed that consistent results were obtained with this treatment within the statistical error .",
    "we fitted spectra of the offset observations in the 0.35  kev @xmath30 5.0  kev energy range for the bi and 0.40  kev @xmath30 5.0  kev except the energy of anomalous response at the si k - edge , 1.8251.840  kev , for the fi .",
    "when we fitted the spectra of a2218 , the energy range was extended up to 7.0 kev in order to cover the fe - k lines .",
    "we excluded 5.855.95  kev and 6.456.55  kev , because the slight difference in intensity of mn  k emission lines from the @xmath28fe calibration sources between a2218 observations and night earth observations causes relatively large residuals .",
    "the spectra of a2218 ( black ) , offset - a ( red ) , and offset - b ( green ) , as well as the night earth spectra ( blue ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : a2218comparespectra ] . left and right panels are for bi and fi spectra , respectively .",
    "the difference in the detector area due to point - source exclusion was corrected in the figure for illustrative purposes .",
    "we mainly performed simultaneous fits for the two spectra obtained by the bi and the combined fi sensors .",
    "however , it was also confirmed that the spectrum with the bi sensor only gave consistent results .",
    "this indicates that the uncertainty in the fi response around 0.5 kev is not crucial compared with the statistical errors in the bi spectrum .",
    "evaluation of the systematic uncertainties is crucial in constraining the emission from the whim .",
    "firstly , the emission is in the soft x - ray region where the xis has various systematic uncertainties , so we have to look into many possible effects .",
    "secondly , the observation was carried out only three months after the launch of _ suzaku _ , and time variation of the detector response needs to be carefully considered .",
    "the first uncertainty is the detector response .",
    "the largest systematic uncertainty in the detector response is the thickness of contaminant on the obf of the xis . in the 0.40.6 kev band ,",
    "most of the photons we observe are thermal emission from the icm .",
    "if we underestimate the contaminant thickness , the flux from the icm would be overestimated in @xmath31  kev , because the temperature and abundance are strongly constrained by the data in the higher energy range @xmath32  kev .",
    "this naturally leads to an underestimation of the soft - excess flux .",
    "therefore , we also considered a _",
    "thicker _ contaminant model at the upper limit of the uncertainty range .",
    "we generated arfs with 20% thicker contaminant using xissimarfgen assuming the observation occurred seventeen days later than it actually did .",
    "this 20% increase , which exceeds the uncertainty quoted by the xis team ( @xmath33 ; koyama et  al .",
    "2006 ) , is a reasonable value , given the additional uncertainties in the response to diffuse emission and in early observations .",
    "the energy resolution of the xis worsens with time . at the time of our observations ,",
    "the energy resolution had degraded by @xmath34  ev ( fwhm ) at 5.9  kev ( from 130  ev to 150  ev ) .",
    "this effect was investigated by smoothing the response with a gaussian .",
    "since we have no information about the degradation at @xmath35  kev , we tried gaussians with sigmas of 5  ev , 10  ev , 15 ev , 20 ev , 30 ev and 35  ev . with this smoothing , the spectral resolution at @xmath360.5 kev increases from 40 ev to 42 ev , 46 ev , 53 ev , 62 ev , 81 ev and 91 ev , respectively .",
    "the results are presented later .",
    "the internal background of the xis is quite stable , and there were no `` background flares '' during our observations .",
    "however , when cor is low ( cor@xmath37 ) , the internal background level becomes comparable to the x - ray background in the @xmath38  kev range .",
    "therefore , we also extracted spectra with the condition cor @xmath39 to examine this systematic effect .",
    "another uncertainty is the spatial variation of the galactic emission .",
    "the _ rosat _",
    "r4 map shows @xmath33 variations among the a2218 , offset - a and offset - b fields .",
    "the purpose of the two offset observations ( offset - a and offset - b ) was to look at the spectral variation in the galactic emission and to include it in the analysis .",
    "besides the inclusion of this variation , we also extended our upper limit for the soft excess by assuming 10% fainter galactic emission .",
    "before the analysis of the a2218 spectrum , we analyzed data from the offset pointings to estimate the spectrum of the galactic emission .",
    "the diffuse x - ray background at high galactic latitude can be divided into three components : i.e.  the local hot bubble ( lhb ) , the milky way halo ( mwh ) and the extragalactic power - law ( cxb ) components @xcite .",
    "typical temperatures are about 0.1 kev for the lhb and 0.20.3 kev for the mwh , while the cxb spectrum has a photon index of @xmath40 .",
    "the lhb is thought to surround the solar system with a @xmath41  pc scale , and hence it has no galactic absorption .",
    "the cxb component is extragalactic and known to be uniform over the entire sky . in contrast , the level of lhb and mwh components vary from position to position .",
    "reported that the mean deviation of the 0.21.0  kev intensity is @xmath42 from field to field .",
    "our purpose here is to constrain the spectra of the two galactic components so as to obtain reliable background data for the estimation of the warm emission around a2218 .",
    "spectra for an annular region with @xmath43 were produced for the offset - a and offset - b data .",
    "xspec v11.3.2r was used in the spectral analysis .",
    "the spectra , from which non x - ray background was subtracted , were fitted with a model for the sum of lhb , mwh and cxb .",
    "cxb and mwh components were absorbed by galactic absorption characterized by @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "the collisionally ionized thermal plasma model apec was used in xspec to fit the lhb and mwh spectra , with abundance and redshift fixed to 1 solar and 0 , respectively .",

    "however , this value contains an uncertainty ; while the abundance was mostly determined by the fe k and l features in the fit , fe and o abundances may have a different value .",
    "we estimated the upper limit of @xmath84 for the redshifted o line from the whim in the extreme case of no o in the icm , because this situation gives the largest contribution from the whim .",
    "the upper limit then increased to @xmath89 and @xmath90 for the offset - a and offset - b backgrounds , respectively .",
    "next , we investigated how the upper limits of @xmath84 change by considering the systematic uncertainties described in   [ sec : analysis - method ] .",
    "we already checked one of these uncertainties in table  [ tab : a2218-offsetfixed - gauss ] : variation of the galactic emission between offset - a and offset - b fields .",
    "the difference is @xmath91 . when we used the arfs with 20% thicker contaminant , the upper limits of the o and o lines increased by @xmath92 and @xmath93 , respectively .",
    "these limits further increase by @xmath94 and @xmath93 for the respective lines , if we adopt 10% fainter galactic emission . on the other hand ,",
    "the upper limits do not increase when we select the data for the low background condition ( cor@xmath39 ) or when the energy resolution of the detector was artificially degraded by 535  ev .",
    "to summarize , the conservative upper limits are derived by assuming no o in the icm and employing the arfs with 20% thicker contaminant and 10% fainter galactic model for the offset - b observation ; the values are @xmath1  @xmath3 and @xmath2  @xmath3 for o and o lines , respectively .",

    "the object was selected because its redshift ( @xmath0 ) would allow the xis to separate the whim lines from the galactic ( @xmath106 ) ones , and because an elongated structure in the line - of - sight direction was suggested from the previous studies of this cluster .",
    "we detected no redshifted o lines , and set a constraint on their intensities . in this section",

    "the surface brightness levels of the o or o emission lines that were reported so far from the _ xmm - newton _ observations are similar to or higher than that of the galactic emission .",
    "in contrast , the upper limit of o line intensity in the a2218 vicinity obtained in this work is about six times lower than the galactic level .",
    "the upper limit for o is also lower than the level reported as a positive detection in other works .",

    ", we will constrain the density of the cloud assuming the temperature to be @xmath112  k , since the o line is strongest at this temperature . substituting @xmath113 with the value calculated with the spex code @xcite , our constraint",
    ", @xmath114  @xmath115 at @xmath0 , and electron - to - hydrogen number density ratio @xmath116 for ionized gas , gives the following condition @xmath117 note that @xmath118  mpc corresponds to @xmath119 , the average diameter of the annular region where we extracted the spectra .",
    "the overdensity @xmath120 of this cloud is    @xmath121    where @xmath122 is the mean hydrogen density in the universe , in which @xmath123 is the hydrogen - to - baryon mass ratio , @xmath124 is the baryon density of the universe , @xmath125 is the critical density of the universe , and @xmath126 is the proton mass . even though this level of overdensity is much higher than the typical whim density ( @xmath127 )",
    ", it shows that suzaku can certainly detect the high - density end of the whim distribution that is predicted to exist near clusters .",
    "although we have set a tight constraint on the intensity of redshifted o lines , the inherent sensitivity of the xis was presumably not achieved , since the redshifted o line fell almost on the galactic o line , while the redshifted o line overlapped with the instrumental neutral o edge .",
    "therefore , better sensitivity is expected for clusters with a redshift such that the redshifted lines are free from the galactic and instrumental features .",
    "for example , a redshift of @xmath128 or @xmath129 is suitable for this purpose .",
    "the former case is more promising , because the surface brightness of high-@xmath79 clusters is lower and because the contamination of bright icm emission in the center of the cluster makes the detection of warm - hot emission in the outskirts difficult for distant clusters .",
    "note that the xis is capable of separating a redshift difference of @xmath130 at the o line energy .",
    "because of the contamination on the xis obf , the effective area at the redshifted o line had dropped by @xmath131 at the time of the a2218 observation .",
    "if there had been no contamination on the obf , we could have obtained more photons by this fraction .",
    "this contamination also caused a large systematic uncertainty corresponding to about 5% of the ovii line flux . since the thickness and chemical composition of the contaminant will be better understood as more data are accumulated , the uncertainty will be less influential in future observations .",
    "furthermore , we hope that the original xis sensitivity in the soft x - ray energy range can be recovered in the future by hardware changes including warming the contaminated obfs .",
    "it should be noted that in most cases concerning the search for faint whim emission with ccd sensors , the variation of galactic emission causes a larger uncertainty than the statistical one .",
    "offset observations , such as those carried out in our work , are always desirable to determine the background emission level reliably . looking at a somewhat longer time frame , observations with microcalorimeters are promising , because their outstanding energy resolution ( @xmath132 ev ) for extended sources can easily separate the whim emission from the galactic spectral features .",
    "for example , two orders of magnitude higher sensitivity than the present work is expected with a small mission such as _ dios _ ( diffuse ionized oxygen surveyor ; * ? ? ? * ) , which is proposed to be launched in early 2010s @xcite .",
    "we used _ suzaku _ xis observations to constrain the intensity of o emission lines around the cluster of galaxies a2218 . after considering systematic uncertainties mainly caused by the galactic emission and the uncertainty in the detector response",
    ", we obtained upper limits for the surface brightness of the o and o lines of @xmath1  @xmath3 and @xmath2  @xmath3 , respectively .",
