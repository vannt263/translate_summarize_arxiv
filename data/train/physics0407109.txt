    "there is a growing interest in the properties of cold alkaline - earth atoms .",
    "one of the main reasons for this interest is a possible construction of optical clocks , whose precision might exceed that of the current atomic standard of time@xcite .",
    "in particular , optical clocks based on an intercombination transition of alkaline - earth atoms are seen as good candidates for the next time standard@xcite . increased accuracy of time standards",
    "is , for example , desired for the search for a time - dependent variation of fundamental constants in atomic experiments , which thereby would verify claims based on astrophysical data@xcite .",
    "the recent observation of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in an ytterbium gas@xcite raises hopes for alkaline earth atoms , which have similar electronic structure .",
    "such achievement would allow a study of cold gasses over a wide range of temperatures .",
    "milli- and microkelvin temperatures are reached by doppler cooling on the @xmath0@xmath4 resonance and the @xmath0@xmath1 intercombination line , respectively .",
    "nanokelvin temperatures are typical for bose condensates and are reached by evaporative cooling .",
    "another important reason for interest in alkaline - earth atoms is the absence of a nuclear spin in some isotopes .",
    "this offers an unique opportunity towards a fundamental study of doppler cooling .",
    "moreover , isotopes with zero and nonzero nuclear spin allow a comparison of doppler and sub - doppler cooling@xcite .",
    "the description of atom - atom interactions is much simpler for a nuclear spin - less system .",
    "in fact , the basic theory of photoassociation in strong laser fields@xcite might be easier to confirm in alkaline - earth gases than in alkali - metal gases , where to date most of the research has been done .",
    "scattering of atoms in ground and excited states lead to a collisional frequency shift that contributes to the error budget of an optical clock .",
    "a bose condensate crucially depends on atom - atom collisions .",
    "photoassociative ( pa ) spectroscopy @xcite is one of the most powerful tools to characterize these scattering processes .",
    "it was developed after the success of laser cooling of neutral atoms in the 1980 s @xcite .",
    "we will focus our investigation on pa spectroscopy of ultracold alkaline - earth atoms . in the presence of laser light , two colliding ground - state atoms , labelled by the scattering state `` @xmath5 '' ,",
    "absorb a photon forming an excited molecular bound state `` @xmath6''@xcite . this process is called photoassociation",
    ". the excited state decays to product states `` @xmath7 '' leading to detectable loss of atoms from an atomic trap .",
    "the variation of the atom loss as a function of laser frequency gives the photoassociation spectrum .",
    "the shape of photoassociation lines not only depends on the properties of the colliding atoms but also on the temperature and other conditions in a trap@xcite .",
    "phoatoassociation spectra close to the resonance of the @xmath0@xmath4 transition in alkaline - earth atoms were theoretically analyzed by machholm _",
    "_ @xcite and others @xcite .",
    "recently , degenhardt _",
    "et al_. @xcite measured the photoassociation spectra of cold calcium atoms near this transition at mk temperatures .",
    "et al_. @xcite used the photoassociation spectroscopy to determined the scattering length of @xmath8yb .",
    "this paper analyzes properties of photoassociation spectra near the intercombination line , i.e. laser frequencies close to the @xmath0@xmath1 transition .",
    "a dipole transition between pure singlet and triplet states is forbidden",
    ". however , alkaline - earth atom states labelled @xmath1 are not pure triplet states and have a small singlet component .",
    "this component mostly comes from mixing with the nearby @xmath4 state and give rise to a weak dipole transition between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 state .",
    "consequently , the @xmath0@xmath1 atomic line has a small natural width . as an example we have carried out calculations for calcium .",
    "we describe the shape of photoassociation lines with very - small natural width and weak laser radiation .",
    "the doppler effect as well as the photon recoil must be taken into account .",
    "this is in sharp contrast with the usual treatment of pa@xcite in which these two effects are neglected .",
    "secondly , we discuss possible patterns of vibrational levels in photoassociation spectra near the intercombination line .",
    "close - coupled ro - vibrational bound states are obtained using an interaction hamiltonian , which is based on our electronic - structure potentials@xcite and recently calculated dispersion coefficients@xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian also includes coupling between @xmath4 and metastable @xmath9 states .",
    "the interatomic potential between two ground state calcium atoms is relatively well known@xcite .",
    "it is shown that when the interaction in the ground and excited state is similar the reflection approximation @xcite can not be applied to calculate the intensities of photoassociations lines .",
    "this is unlike photoassociation spectra near strongly allowed transitions , where the interaction in the ground and excited states differs significantly and the reflection approximation is well satisfied .",
    "finally , we show that efficient production of cold molecules in the ground electronic state using photoassociation should be feasible .",
    "the photoassociation process occurs in a thermal cloud of cold atoms at temperature @xmath10 interacting with weak laser radiation .",
    "after absorption of a photon of frequency @xmath11 , two atoms form an excited molecular bound state @xmath12 with energy @xmath13 .",

    "the description of photoassociation for very narrow lines requires us to include two new effects .",

    "the total mass of the system is @xmath33 , @xmath34 is the wave vector of the laser radiation with absolute value @xmath35 , and @xmath36 is the speed of light .",
    "after photoassociation the excited molecule gains the momentum @xmath37 of the absorbed photon and , therefore , has a translational kinetic energy of @xmath38 in the moving frame defined before the absorbtion of the photon . consequently , photoassociation is most efficient when @xmath39 or in terms of detunings @xmath40 .",
    "the excited molecular states created in the pa process either decay back to the ground state or can be further excited to ionizing states . in the former case the product states escape from the trap and give rise to trap loss .",
    "ions are detected in the latter case . in this paper",
    "we will only model trap loss .",
    "the loss mechanisms are characterized by a rate coefficient @xmath41 , which describes the efficiency of the process for a given laser detuning , intensity @xmath42 , and atom temperature .",

    "the rate coefficient @xmath41 is linear in the weak laser field intensity @xmath42 . for higher intensities the center of",
    "the pa line shifts linearly with @xmath42 @xcite and the width of the line increases .",
    "the description of the pa line shape presented in this work , for simplicity , omits this shift as it can be neglected in the weak laser field regime .",
    "the photoassociation trap - loss rate coefficient involves a thermal average of the rate coefficient for a given pair of momenta @xmath28 and @xmath23 in the laboratory frame .",

    "the transition probability from an initial state to the product states can be described by a generalized resonance formula @xcite @xmath62 where the total width of the excited bound state @xmath6 , @xmath63 , is the sum of its natural radiative width @xmath64 , the contribution @xmath65 from predissociation , and the stimulated widths @xmath66 caused by the laser coupling between the excited and ground states .",

    "such a lineshape can be expected for strongly allowed transitions at ultra - low temperatures on the order of nanokelvins , such as exist in bose condensates @xcite .    in a second limiting case",
    "the shape of the line is a `` cut - off exponential '' .",
    "this profile can be obtained when @xmath82 is much larger than @xmath81 and @xmath80 and the energy dependence of @xmath66 is neglected ( compare discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite where the energy dependence @xmath84 describing the wigner threshold law behavior is considered ) .",
    "the lorentzian @xmath83 can be replaced by a delta - dirac function with argument @xmath85 and the integrals can be solved analytically .",
    "in fact , the profile is proportional to @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the heaviside step function : @xmath88 for @xmath89 and @xmath90 for @xmath91 .",
    "the full width at @xmath92 of the exponential lineshape equals the thermal width @xmath82 .",
    "this lineshape is most easily observed at magneto - optical trapping temperatures on the order of a millikelvin .",
    "finally , for the unusual situation of extremely weak transitions at nanokelvin temperatures one could try to achieve conditions in which @xmath81 is much bigger than @xmath82 and @xmath80 .",
    "in such a case the lorentzian can again be replaced by a delta function but now with an argument that only depends on @xmath93 and @xmath18 .",

    "line shape doppler broadening is neglected . to find conditions for which this approximation breaks down , the relative importance of doppler and thermal effects must be determined .",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath94 at temperature @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the atomic recoil temperature . at temperatures @xmath97 thermal broadening dominates , while for @xmath98 doppler broadening can determine the shape of the line .",
    "in fact , this requirement is not sufficient .",
    "it is also necessary to assume that the doppler width is comparable or bigger than @xmath80 .",
    "the influence of the photon recoil on the pa spectra is to very good approximation described by an uniform shift , @xmath99 , of all pa lines .",
    "it should be noted that the photon recoil energy of the two - atom molecule is two times smaller than the photon recoil energy of an isolated atom @xmath100 .",
    "this indicates that for molecular bound states close to atomic levels there should exist a transition region from recoiling as a molecule to recoiling as an atom .",
    "our theory does not treat this effect and should only be applied to molecular states with a binding energy that is much bigger than the photon recoil energy .",
