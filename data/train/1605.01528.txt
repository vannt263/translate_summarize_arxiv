    "jaynes , using the information - theoretic shannon measure , showed how the equilibrium distributions of the statistical mechanics can be obtained through maxent approach @xcite , establishing a connection between information theory and statistical mechanics .",

    "these generalized entropies yielded the inverse - power law distributions through the maximization procedure @xcite .",
    "hence , the maxent approach has mainly been considered as the justification of the equilibrium distributions of these generalized entropies .",
    "this led to the numerous applications of these generalized entropies with the aim of a novel non - equilibrium statistical mechanics @xcite .",

    "however , this limit instead becomes @xmath98 ( i.e. @xmath99 ) as @xmath100 , implying that the ordinary canonical distribution in the limit @xmath100 is obtained at the expense of a micro - canonical maximization ( note that the third term on the right hand side of eq . ( [ sample1 ] ) becomes zero , leaving only the normalization constraint when @xmath100 ) .",
    "the only way out is that one can have @xmath91 as @xmath100 , which renders the partition function of the ordinary canonical distribution zero in general which is nonsensical .",

    "the results for the rnyi measure are exactly the same with the ones of the tsallis measure for both @xmath133 ( red solid line ) and @xmath134 ( green solid line ) .",

    "this result should not be confused with the additivity of the entropy measure itself .",
    "for example , rnyi entropy is additive as an entropy measure just like the shannon entropy , but its slope is not additive unlike the shannon entropy .",

    "when one has the factorized normalized structure @xmath153 as a result of the maxent principle , the denominator @xmath158 plays the role of the partition function from which all the thermodynamic observables follow .",
    "however , since an entropy measure undergoing the maxent procedure can not yield such a factorizable normalized structure if it has a non - additive slope , one can not obtain the partition function and all related observables in a consistent manner .",

    ", the only factorizable normalized structure stems from the shannon entropy , since its slope is additive .",
    "the rnyi and tsallis entropies yield this same result only when their deformation index @xmath102 becomes unity , thereby reducing to the shannon measure .",
    "there seems to be at least two main routes to follow if one wants to obtain factorized generalized equilibrium distributions : the first route is to modify the lagrange multipliers which leads to contradiction as we have already shown .",
    "the second route is to consider different averaging schemes such as the escort averaging procedure for example .",
    "this second possibility requires a very detailed and non - trivial discussion by itself so that it will be presented elsewhere .",
    "a word of caution is also in order : one might consider that the concomitant legendre structure is preserved even for generalized entropies with non - additive slope such as tsallis entropy , for example .",
    "our work does not deny this fact , since we are here interested in whether the partition function used in the assessment of the legendre structure is indeed a partition function factorized from the normalized optimal distribution obtained through the maxent .",
    "whether one has the factorized and normalized optimal distribution apparently precedes the issue of the preservation of the legendre structure .",
    "it is finally worth noting that for obtaining the canonical partition function , the current criterion sets more bounds on the respective entropy measures compatible with the maxent procedure than the shore and johnson axioms @xcite , since these axioms do not limit the use of the rnyi entropy in the context of maxent @xcite whereas the criterion of the additive slope does .",
