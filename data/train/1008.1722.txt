    "one of the most alluring observational discoveries of the past decade has been that the expansion of the universe is speeding up rather than slowing down [ 1 ] .",
    "an accelerating universe is strongly suggested by observations of type ia high redshift supernovae provided these behave as standard candles . the case for an accelerating universe",
    "is further strengthened by the discovery of cosmic microwave background ( cmb)[2 ] and galaxy power spectrum for large scale structures [ 3 ] .",
    "these studies indicate that in spatially flat isotropic universe , about two - thirds of the critical energy density seems to be stored in a so called dark energy ( de ) component with enough negative pressure responsible for the currently cosmic accelerating expansion [ 4 ] . strength of this acceleration depends on the theoretical model employed while interpreting the data . a wide range of scenarios",
    "have been proposed to explain this acceleration but most of them can not explain all the features of the universe or they have so many parameters that they are difficult to fit .",
    "the models which have been discussed widely in literature are those which consider vacuum energy ( cosmological constant ) as de , introduce a fifth element and dub it quintessence or scenarios named phantom with @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a parameter of state [ 5 ] .",
    "+   + an approach to the problem of de arises from the holographic principle that states that the number of degrees of freedom related directly to entropy scales with the enclosing area of the system [ 5 ] . based on the holographic principle proposed by fischler and susskind [ 6 ]",
    "several others have studied holographic model for dark energy ( hde ) [ 7 ] .",
    "the holographic energy density is given by @xmath2 in which @xmath3 is a free dimensionless parameter and the coefficient 3 is for convenience . as an application of the holographic principle in cosmology",
    ", it was shown that the consequence of excluding those degrees of freedom of the system which will never be observed by the effective field theory gives rise to ir cut - off @xmath4 at the future event horizon .",
    "thus , in a universe dominated by de , the future event horizon will tend to a constant of the order @xmath5 , the present hubble radius [ 5 ] . +   + in 1973 , bekenstein [ 8 ] assumed that there is a relation between the event of horizon and the thermodynamics of a black hole , so that the event of horizon of the black hole is a measure of the entropy of it .",
    "this idea has been generalized to horizons of cosmological models , so that each horizon corresponds to an entropy .",
    "thus the second law of thermodynamics was modified in the way that in generalized form , the sum of all time derivative of entropies related to horizons plus time derivative of normal entropy must be positive , i.e. the sum of entropies must be increasing function of time .",
    "davies [ 9 ] investigated the validity of generalized second law ( gsl ) for the cosmological models which departs slightly from de sitter space .",
    "however , it is only natural to associate an entropy to the horizon area as it measures our lack of knowledge about what is going on beyond it .",
    "setare [ 10 ] investigated the validity of the generalized second law of thermodynamics for the quintom model of dark energy .",
    "setare [ 7 ] considered the interacting holographic model of dark energy to investigate the validity of the generalized second law of thermodynamics in a non - flat ( closed ) universe enclosed by the event horizon measured from the sphere of the horizon @xmath4 .",
    "setare and shafei [ 5 ] showed that for the apparent horizon the first law is roughly respected for different epochs while the second law of thermodynamics is respected , while for @xmath4 as the system s ir cut - off the first law is broken and the second law is respected for the special range of the deceleration parameter .",
    "+   + there have been many works aimed at connecting the string theory with inflation .",
    "various ideas in string theory based on the concept of branes have proved themselves fruitful .",
    "scenarios where the inflation is interpreted as the distance between two branes moving in the extra dimension along a warped throat have given rise to many interesting studies [ 11 ] .",
    "one area which has been well explored in recent years , is inflation driven by the open string sector through dynamical dp - branes .",
    "this is the so - called dbi ( dirac - born - infield ) inflation [ 12 , 13 , 14 ] , which lies in a special class of k - inflation models .",
    "martin and yamaguchi [ 13 ] introduced a scalar field model where the kinetic term has a dbi form and considered that the dark energy scalar field is a dbi scalar field , for which the action of the field can be written as    @xmath6\\ ] ]    where @xmath7 is the tension and @xmath8 is the potential . to obtain a suitable evolution of the universe an interaction",
    "is often assumed such that the decay rate should be proportional to the present value of the hubble parameter for good fit to the expansion history of the universe as determined by the supernovae and cmb data [ 15 ] .",
    "these kind of models describe an energy flow between the components so that no components are conserved separately .",
    "there are several work on the interaction between dark energy ( tachyon or phantom ) and dark matter [ 16 ] , where phenomenologically introduced different forms of interaction term .",
    "+   + the present paper is an extension of the paper of the present authors chattopadhyay and debnath ( 2010 ) [ ref 17 ] . in the said paper [ 17 ]",
    ", the interactions between different candidates of dark energy and dbi - essence model were considered . for the sake of simplicity in the presentation ,",
    "the interactions discussed in reference [ 17 ] have been described briefly and subsequently the gsl has been considered.organizations of the present paper is as follows : in section ii we have given a brief introduction to the generalized second law ( gsl ) of thermodynamics with respect to cosmology ; in section iii we have considered the gsl in the interacting dbi - essence and modified chaplygin gas ( mcg ) ; in section iv gsl has been viewed in presence of interacting dbi - essence and hessence ; in section v we have investigated gsl in presence of interacting dbi - essence and tachyonic field .",
    "in the present work , we consider the universe as a flat frw universe and take into account that the accelerating universe has a future event horizon @xmath9 , which is also named as cosmological horizon [ 11 ] .",
    "the radius of observer s event horizon is given by [ 5 ]    @xmath10    to study the generalized second law ( gsl ) through the universe under the interaction between tachyonic field and scalar ( phantom ) field we would examine the nature of the derivative of the normal entropy @xmath11 in presence of interaction .",
    "it is a proven fact that for phantom dominated universe @xmath12 and for a quintessence dominated universe @xmath13 [ 10 ] .",
    "our target is to answer the question : _ is @xmath12 under the interaction between dbi - essence and other dark energies _ ? .",
    "the expression for normal entropy using the first law of thermodynamics is    @xmath14    also we know that    @xmath15    and    @xmath16    using @xmath17 in equation ( 3 ) we get    @xmath18    from equation ( [ 1 ] ) , it can be obtained that    @xmath19    if the horizon entropy is taken to be @xmath20 , we get    @xmath21    taking the temperature @xmath22 and using @xmath23 we can write    @xmath24    in the subsequent sections , we would investigate the validity of the equation ( 9 ) in various interacting situations .",

    "the einstein field equations are given by ( choosing @xmath27 )    the energy conservation equation is given by    @xmath28    if we consider a model consisting of two component mixture , the an interaction term needs to be introduced . in a two - component model ,",
