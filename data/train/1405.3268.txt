    "the early stages of low - mass star formation are characterized by extremely enhanced molecular deuteration observed for various gaseous species . in spite of the low cosmic elemental reservoir of deuterium ( @xmath1 ,",
    "* ) , the deuterium fractionation of simply and doubly deuterated species can reach @xmath2 % and @xmath3 % , respectively in low - mass prestellar cores and class 0 protostars @xcite while triply deuterated isotopologues have also been detected @xcite .",
    "the deuterium chemistry in the gas phase is believed to be triggered by the deuterium exchange between hd and h@xmath4 , as the deuterium reservoir is likely initially located in hd , via the reaction @xmath5 which is in competition with the reaction between h@xmath4 and co. in dense and cold prestellar cores , the co freeze - out at the surface of interstellar grains increases the reactivity of reaction ( [ deut_reac ] ) as well as its deuterated analogues through the decrease of the destruction of h@xmath6 via the reaction between h@xmath4 and co. for high densities and high co depletions , the gas phase d / h abundance ratio of deuterated species can easily reach 100 % @xcite .",
    "since reaction ( [ deut_reac ] ) is exothermic , its backward process can not occur in the cold conditions ( @xmath7 k ) found in prestellar cores if only the para spin state of h@xmath0 is considered .",
    "however , due to its higher internal energy , the ortho spin state allows the reaction between h@xmath0 and h@xmath0d@xmath8 to occur , even at low temperatures .",
    "therefore , the ortho / para ratio of h@xmath0 opr(h@xmath0 ) strongly influences the deuteration of gaseous species in prestellar cores @xcite .",
    "millimetric observations performed towards class 0 protostars have shown that various molecules , mostly formed at the surface of interstellar grains in molecular clouds and evaporated in the warm inner regions of protostellar envelopes at @xmath9 k ( the so - called hot corinos ) , show different deuterations .",
    "for example , in the low - mass protostar prototype iras 16293 - 2422 ( hereafter i16293 ) , formaldehyde and methanol show higher deuterations ( with d / h ratios of 15 and 40 % , respectively , see * ? ? ?",

    "* ) than ammonia and water ( @xmath10 and 3 % , respectively , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the deuterium fractionation can be used as a chemical tool to retrace the history of interstellar ices and gas - grain astrochemical models have been developed to interpret the observations of low - mass protostars @xcite .",
    "the lower deuterium fractionation of water with respect to that of formaldehyde and methanol is likely due to a different epoch of formation .",
    "water would be mainly produced for typical molecular cloud conditions ( low density and warm temperature ) while most of formaldehyde and methanol would be formed afterwards , during the colder and denser prestellar phase .",
    "a low opr(h@xmath0 ) , lower than @xmath11 , is also required to reproduce the observed deuterations @xcite .",
    "because of its high sensitivity to the variation of physical and chemical parameters , the deuterium fractionation can also be used to probe the chemical evolution through the formation of low - mass stars like the sun .",
    "the comparison of the molecular content observed in prestellar cores and low - mass protostars with that found in solar system comets and meteorites shows that the deuterium fractionation of water and organics decreases by several orders of magnitude ( from 1 - 100 % to 0.01 - 0.1 % , see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the decrease of the d / h ratio with the evolutionary stage of star formation can be interpreted by the chemical alteration of the molecular content in protoplanetary disks and in the solar nebula .",
    "molecules observed in protostellar envelopes will be eventually recycled in protoplanetary disks due to the high turbulent mixing and the strong uv and x - ray radiation fields irradiating the disks @xcite .",
    "the difference of deuteration could also come from the different scales probed by the astronomical observations and by the study of solar system bodies .",
    "most of the meteorites and comets studied in our solar system were initially relatively closed to the sun ( @xmath12 au ) while most of sub - millimetric astronomical observations of low - mass protostars are sensitive to much larger scales of several hundreds / thousands of au ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "new observations of deuterated water performed with the _ herschel space observatory _",
    "@xcite as well as ground - based interferometers @xcite towards low - mass protostars have allowed astronomers to probe the deuteration of warm water originating from the inner regions of protostellar envelopes ( @xmath13 au ) , and suggest that warm water shows a lower deuteration ( [ hdo]/[h@xmath0o ] @xmath14 % ) than the values derived in previous studies with single - dish telescopes ( 1 - 10 % , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , @xcite showed that the deuteration of cold water originating from the external envelope would be higher ( @xmath15 % ) than the deuteration of warm inner water .",
    "these observations , therefore , suggest an evolution of the deuteration within protostellar envelopes encompassed by the large beam of single - dish telescopes used so far to study the deuteration of most of molecules .",
    "consequently , astrochemical models have to to be coupled with evolutionary models to properly follow the deuteration within prestellar cores and protostellar envelopes .",
    "a previous attempt has been made by @xcite who followed the evolution of the molecular deuteration from molecular clouds to protostellar envelopes through the coupling of a gas - grain astrochemical model with a one - dimensional radiative hydrodynamic model .",
    "these authors showed an evolution of the chemical abundances of icy species and complex organics with the age of the protostar and gave predictions for their deuterium fractionation .",
    "however , they used a standard two - phase gas - grain astrochemical model which did not allow them to distinguish the chemical processes between the ice surface and the ice mantle , a crucial aspect for the modelling of deuterated ices @xcite , and did not include the effect of the spin states of h@xmath0 on the deuterium chemistry .",
    "the ortho / para ratio of h@xmath0 is believed to evolve in molecular clouds from a high ortho / para ratio , induced by its formation at the surface of interstellar grains as recently observed in laboratory experiments @xcite to its low boltzmann value ( @xmath16 ) , with a timescale comparable to the lifetime of molecular clouds ( @xmath17 yr , see * ? ? ?",
    "the slow decrease of the opr(h@xmath0 ) is supported by the non - detection of dco@xmath8 towards interstellar clouds outside dense cores which has been attributed by @xcite to an opr(h@xmath0 ) higher to 0.1 . since interstellar ices start to form in translucent regions of molecular clouds , when the visual extinction exceeds @xmath18",
    "mag @xcite , a part of these interstellar ices would likely form when the opr(h@xmath0 ) is still high .    in this work , we aim at self - consistently studying the deuterium chemistry from molecular clouds to protostellar envelopes . for this purpose , we coupled our astrochemical model grainoble with a simple , but accurate , one - dimensional evolutionary model of core collapse and we included the spin states of h@xmath0 and light ions that are of crucial importance for the deuterium chemistry",
    ". we will focus our study on the formation , the deuteration and the evaporation of interstellar ices and complex organics , which are believed to be relevant for the prebiotic chemistry found in the solar system ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the physical code and the astrochemical model are described in section 2 . in section 3",
    ", we present the evolution of the molecular deuteration by focusing our study on the main ice components and on complex organics formed at the surface of grains .",
    "we then discuss the implications of our work in section 4 and present our conclusions in section 5 .",
    "this section describes the physical model used in this work to follow the formation of a prestellar core and its collapse , giving birth to a central protostar surrounded by a protostellar envelope .",
    "the physical evolution can be divided into three steps : 1 ) the static formation of the dense core for @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is defined as the beginning of the core contraction ; 2 ) the collapse of the dense core for @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the free - fall timescale of the core ; 3 ) the birth of the protostar and the collapse of the protostellar envelope for @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the timescale of the class 0 stage , defined as the moment when the mass of the central protostar reaches half of the total ( protostar+envelope ) mass .",
    "we considered 182 shells of gas and dust initially spaced between @xmath25 au so they are spaced at logarithmic intervals for specific times during the class 0 stage .",
    "because the core is evolving dynamically , the position of each shell evolves with time , so it is necessary to solve the chemistry in a frame of reference comoving with the gas in the lagrangian coordinates .",
    "we followed the formation of the dense core by assuming a static contraction , starting from a homogeneous translucent sphere of a density @xmath26 embedded in surroundings by a visual extinction @xmath27 . during its static contraction",
    ", the core keeps a plummer - like density profile obtained from this equation @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the central density , @xmath30 is the characteristic radius inside which the density is uniform .",
    "outside @xmath30 , the density follows a power - law r@xmath31 when @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath29 increases with time between @xmath26 and the central density of the observed core @xmath33 ( see section [ free_parameters ] ) to reach different selected intermediate central densities @xmath29 in timescales given by their respective free - fall timescale .",
    "the choice of the intermediate and final central densities ( and of their timescale ) is explained in section [ free_parameters ] and is based on the observational estimates of molecular clouds ages . as @xmath34 is given by the product of the sound speed and the free - fall time of the central density @xmath29 @xcite , @xmath30 decreases with @xmath35 .",
    "after its static formation , the dense core undergoes a free - fall collapse following the model developed by @xcite . at @xmath36 ,",
    "the collapse is triggered artificially , the density and velocity profiles as well as the accretion rate are followed with time from equations ( 4 ) , ( 6 ) , and ( 7 ) of @xcite .    due to the rapid accretion of the inner shells towards the center ,",
    "a protostar is formed at the center of the envelope once @xmath37 , with @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the proton mass .",
    "the gravitational energy of the collapsed mass is released radiatively as the material falls onto the protostar radius @xmath40 .",
    "the luminosity of the protostar is , therefore , given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the mass of the protostar , and @xmath43 is the accretion rate .",
    "@xmath43 and @xmath42 are directly given the dynamical model and we derived @xmath40 from the work by @xcite who computed the evolution of the star radius as function of the stellar mass , for different constant accretion rates . since the accretion rate computed by our code evolves with time , we extrapolated their fig .",
    "14 by computing the averaged accretion rate at each timestep relative to the beginning of the protostar formation in order to derive an estimate of @xmath40 for each timestep .",
    "the density profile reached at the end of the static formation phase aims at modelling the starless core l1498 .",
    "l1498 is thought to have a central density @xmath44 @xmath45 and tends to be extended with a radius @xmath46 au and presents a steep slope ( @xmath47 ) @xcite ."
