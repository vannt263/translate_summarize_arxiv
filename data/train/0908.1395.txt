    "before diving in to the content of this paper we make a few comments about what we are doing with this series .",
    "the ultimate origin of the first paper @xcite was a series of lectures given to reu students at baylor university between 2003 and 2009 .",
    "they began with short introductions to relativistic quantum mechanics and over time came to include particle physics , general relativity , and several other topics .",
    "i decided to type out the first part of these notes because at the time i was a graduate student and i knew i could save time in teaching the material if the students could just read it directly instead of waiting on me to write everything up on the board .",
    "after doing so it was suggested that we `` pretty them up '' and post them online .",
    "i found a few other people interested in coauthoring sections i was nt as comfortable writing , and after posting , we received a tremendous amount of positive feedback about the results .",
    "i had no intentions of continuing the project , but since finishing graduate school ( and taking a job unrelated to particle physics ) , i have found that working on notes like these provides a great hobby and gives me an excuse to keep thinking about these fascinating topics .",
    "i originally planned on this second part of the `` simple introduction '' series to cover string theory , but after beginning to write found that i was spending too much time elaborating on mathematical ideas and the ideas were getting lost in the details .",
    "i therefore decided to make the second part cover some of the geometrical ideas necessary to talk about strings , thus pushing string theory to the third part .",
    "however , in working on part ii , i decided it would be fun to a do a full geometrical picture of what was done in @xcite , but soon realized that if these notes were to be self - contained for a first year grad student this would be too long .",
    "so , the `` geometry of gauge theories '' turned into a two part work , and string theory became part iv .",
    "but because the first three parts would be a reasonably comprehensive introduction to non - perturbative quantum field theory and particle physics , why not include a volume on perturbative quantum field theory and particle physics ( making string theory part v ) .",
    "but if we ve gone that far , it would be irresponsible not to include a discussion of supersymmetry and supergravity , and so on and so on .    all that was to say that i ve decided to make this a long term project as a post particle physicist hobby .",
    "the positive side of this is that for those who seem to find the writing style , content , and approach helpful , there will be a plethora of topics covered by the time the project is finished .",
    "the negative side is that it will take significantly longer for the series to be completed . for those who do nt like the writing style , content , or approach",
    "- it does nt matter for them anyway .",
    "we d like to again emphasize the point of these notes .",
    "as the abstract indicates we are nt trying to provide a comprehensive ( or even terribly in - depth ) treatment of any of the topics we cover .",
    "the origin of these notes is in the general plight of graduate students in theoretical particle physics who are nt able to understand everything they see immediately ( i do nt know anyone who can do this ) . after completing the standard undergraduate courses in a physics b.s .",
    ", one still has about two years of time consuming course work to get through the standard topics .",
    "then there s special relativity , relativistic quantum mechanics , quantum field theory , particle physics , gauge theory , general relativity , cosmology , astrophysics , gauge theories , conformal field theory , and so on . and all that assumes a strong understanding ( usually on a graduate level ) of real analysis , complex analysis , linear algebra , ode , pde , topology , abstract algebra , algebraic topology , differential topology , differential geometry , algebraic geometry , lie groups , complex geometry , fibre bundles , characteristic classes , and on and on and on , and _ then you re ready to start a text on string theory .",
    "this is all extremely frustrating and overwhelming for the vast majority of us .",
    "the level of formality in the standard texts on the more advanced topics makes learning them even more formidable .",
    "of course , graduate students can typically go quite a ways without understanding the nuances of each of these topics , but a fuller understanding would certainly be beneficial for most of us . _    while there are countless outstanding references on individual topics ( and subtopics ) on this list , gaining a sense of comfort in working with these ideas requires a holistic picture of all of them . and",
    "unfortunately , to my knowledge there does nt exist a single reference that puts all of this together in a single coherent picture .",
    "there are many excellent math texts on each topic , but physicists often have a hard time reading literature written by mathematicians , and the sheer number of different topics , which span countless authors with different styles , agendas , notations , etc .",
    ", getting that holistic picture is rarely far removed from `` frustrating and overwhelming '' , despite the excellence of individual texts . furthermore , there are many excellent physics texts on each topic , but rarely do physicists want to take the time to outline all of the details underlying the topic they re writing about .",
    "they usually want to emphasize the physics ( who can blame them ) , and they have a specific agenda in what they re writing - to teach the specific physical topic they ve decided to write about . including volumes of extra math is unnecessary .",
    "but for those of us who ca nt make perfect holistic sense of these ideas the first time we come across them , getting that holistic picture is difficult .",
    "frequently grad students in their early year of grad school are left with a reading list of dozens , or even hundreds , of physics and math books and papers which they will have to read , understand , and assimilate into a single coherent picture in their minds . again -",
    "`` frustrating and overwhelming '' for most of us .",
    "this is the root of this series .",
    "it is my hope that through the course of these notes we will cover , at least at a surface level , the majority of these topics . as we mentioned above",
    ", these notes wo nt come close to a full treatment of these topics .",
    "we warn anyone intimately familiar with any of these topics that these notes will likely annoy you due to a lack of rigor , precise language , etc .",
    "our goal , first and foremost , is to explain as clearly as possible where these ideas come from , what motivates them , and how they fit together . when faced with a choice between rigor and clarity , between detail and clarity , between precision and clarity , etc .",
    ", we chose clarity .",
    "we hope that after going through these notes , someone who has never come across these ideas will have a general hook to hang each idea on to get their bearings and a context when the idea comes up later .",
    "for example , we do nt necessarily care if you understand every detail of what a harmonic differential form is , but we do want to you to be able to relate it to the star operator , hodge decomposition , cohomology , betti numbers , euler characteristics , etc .",
    ", and know what type of information can generally be gleaned from them .",
    "so , again , do nt come to these notes expecting a detailed discussion of every nuance of these concepts .",
    "we wrote with someone who has never heard of a `` co - exact form '' or the `` spin connection '' before in mind .",
    "we expect the reader to get a general picture , and then go get more details on a particular topic on their own , either through directed coursework or through relevant literature .",
    "furthermore , a major purpose of these notes is explanation .",
    "a frequent frustration students have with many of the standard texts is the lack of explanation of what certain ideas mean .",
    "for example , most texts on general relativity will discuss the origin of the riemann tensor ( moving vectors around a rectangle , etc . ) .",
    "however , after doing this they define the ricci tensor and ricci scalar as linear combinations of the riemann tensor elements , completely ignoring the fact that both have their own unique geometrical meaning !",
    "another example is the meaning of a connection _ apart from the metric connection .",
    "most students learn about connections from introductory general relativity or differential geometry texts , where almost the entire discussion is related to the metric connection .",
    "then , students come across connections on fibre bundles while trying to learn about gauge theories and have little to no context for how generalized connections work . authors seem to assume some familiarity with them and cite the results with no explanation of meaning .",
    "yet another example is the modern definition of the energy - momentum tensor as the functional derivative of the lagrangian with respect to the metric .",
    "this list goes on an on .",
    "we have tried to include discussions of each of these ideas rather than passing them by , followed by summaries of the main points so the details do nt distract too much from the big picture .",
    "_    we do make the following warning - in @xcite we were careful not to introduce a mathematical idea that would nt come up in the physics part .",
    "this , we believed , worked just fine there .",
    "however we ca nt make the same promise about this volume .",
    "we will introduce several mathematical ideas in the first part that wo nt necessarily come back into play heavily until later in the series .",
    "also , we want to make the warning that the graphics for this volume were either done using graphical software or by hand with a paint software . the the latter case we apologize in advance for the poor quality .",
    "the general content of this paper is as follows : we begin in chapter [ sec : preliminaryconcepts ] with a brief overview of some terms that physicists often forget but will come in handy .",
    "a cursory read is all that is necessary .",
    "chapter [ sec : manifolds ] is then an overview of the main ideas surrounding differentiable manifolds .",
    "the primary concepts are : manifolds , tangent spaces , cotangent spaces , vector and covector frames , tangent maps and pullbacks , integration , and lie groups . chapter [ sec : topcons ] is then a superficial overview of algebraic topology , where we begin with the most conceptually simple but computationally difficult idea ( homotopy ) , and move to the most conceptually difficult but computationally simple idea ( cohomology ) .",
    "we discuss the relationships between these ideas throughout and relate them to the contents of chapter [ sec : manifolds ] .",
    "chapter [ sec : chapwithmet ] then begins the real meat of these notes - differential geometry .",
    "you can essentially view the contents of chapters [ sec : manifolds]-[sec : topcons ] as providing formalisms and tools for chapter [ sec : chapwithmet].-[sec : topcons ] are nt important on their own",
    ". they will be later in the series - it is only in _ this paper that they play a secondary role . _ ] chapter [ sec : chapwithmet ] ties together several of the ideas in the previous chapters together to ultimately allow for a discussion of curvature through the four standard curvature tensors .",
    "then , we begin the physics part of the paper in chapter [ sec : electrodynamics ] with a very brief discussion of electrodynamics in various notations , how they relate , and the advantages of each .",
    "we conclude this with an admittedly superficial discussion of the aharonov - bohm affect .",
    "the primary point of discussion aharonov - bohm is to illustrate that electromagnetism takes a form where cohomology can be easily discussed , thus illustrating the rich topological structure to the theory .",
    "the final major chapter , chapter [ sec : gravity ] , is a very surface level introduction to the main ideas of general relativity , including how the theory was formulated , what its core equations mean , its correspondence with newtonian gravitation , and a few specific applications .",
    "we end chapter [ sec : gravity ] with a discussion of general relativity as a gauge theory in section [ sec : generalrelativityasagaugetheory ] .",
    "this section , along with the final and very brief chapter [ sec : finalchap ] , are the `` whole point '' of this volume as far as physics go . as indicated , we discuss electrodynamics and general relativity largely to illustrate the geometry discussion in the first part of these notes .",
    "the real agenda is to eventually get to general gauge theories . in section",
    "[ sec : generalrelativityasagaugetheory ] and especially chapter [ sec : finalchap ] we introduce how the geometry of these notes generalizes to the tools needed to discuss gauge theories .",
    "finally , we give some idea of where this series is going . the first paper , @xcite , introduced ( mostly non - perturbative ) quantum field theory and particle physics algebraically .",
    "this paper acts as a primer for the geometry needed to reformulate non - perturbative quantum field theory geometrically .",
    "part iii will then discuss non - perturbative quantum field theory and particle physics more fully .",
    "then , with non - perturbative quantum field theory discussed in as much detail as we feel necessary for this series , part iv will then be a detailed discussion of perturbative quantum field theory and particle physics , including discussions of evaluating feynman diagrams , renormalization and the renormalization group , phenomenology , anomalies , etc .",
    "both the third and fourth parts will likely be structured in the same way as this part - a section of mathematics followed by physics .",
    "part v will then be an introduction to supersymmetry and supergravity , including both perturbative and non - perturbative topics .",
    "after that we havent decided entirely on the order - but the likely topics for individual parts will include : conformal field theory , introductory string theory , algebraic geometry , and advanced topics string theory .",
    "we may also eventually include cosmology , astrophysics , and string cosmology .",
    "we welcome and encourage any and all questions , comments , or corrections .",
    "while we have proofread both @xcite and these notes , many mistakes were found in @xcite since they were first posted , and there is little doubt that despite our best efforts this volume will be no different .",
    "we encourage any suggestions regarding correcting mistakes of any kind .",
    "we would also appreciate any comments regarding how we could improve these notes as far as pedagogy goes - the point is to be clear .",
    "if you find a section particularly vague or unclear ( or a section particularly clear ) , please let us know .",
    "matt robinson    m_robinson@baylor.edu",
    "in this paper an the next , our ultimate goal is to recast nearly everything we did in @xcite in a more rigorous mathematical framework .",
    "we spent the first paper learning about group theory , which was the necessary  bare minimum \" mathematical depth we needed to introduce the physical concepts we have looked at so far . for what is to come",
    ", we will need considerably more mathematical detail , especially when we get to string theory in the next paper .",
    "we therefore begin this paper by looking at several foundational mathematical concepts .",
    "you likely already have some familiarity with many of them , or have seen them in math courses before .",
    "our introduction here will be brief .",
    "the first mathematical object we need is called a * set .",
    "a set is a collection of objects that do not necessarily have any additional structure or properties . a collection of fruit , numbers , people",
    ", points in some space , or anything else can form a set .",
    "while set theory is a very large and very deep branch of mathematics , we will not need to consider sets any further in what we are doing , and we therefore move on . *",
    "the second mathematical objects we need are * groups .",
    "we discussed groups in great length in @xcite , and we therefore wo nt repeat that discussion .",
    "we encourage you to reread the relevant sections there , or the references recommended in the further reading sections there . *",
    "the third mathematical objects we need is the concept of a * field .",
    "a field @xmath0 is a collection of objects @xmath1 along with two operations , @xmath2 , called addition , and @xmath3 , called multiplication , such that the following hold : + @xmath4 @xmath5 is an abelian group with identity @xmath6 .",
    "+ @xmath7 @xmath8",
    ". + @xmath9 @xmath10 .",
    "+ @xmath11 @xmath12 .",
    "+ @xmath13 @xmath14 .",
    "+ @xmath15 @xmath16 and + @xmath17 .",
    "+ then @xmath0 is a field .",
    "additionally , if + @xmath18 @xmath19 , we say that @xmath0 is * commutative .",
    "we do not say that @xmath0 is abelian in this case because @xmath0 is a field , not a group . *",
    "*      the fourth mathematical object we introduce is a * vector space .",
    "a vector space @xmath20 consists of a collection of objects @xmath21 ( we are using bold characters instead of the  bar \" vector notation ) , called vectors , and a field @xmath0 with @xmath22 , as defined above such that the following hold : + @xmath4 @xmath23 is an abelian group .",
    "+ @xmath7 if @xmath24 and @xmath25 , then @xmath26",
    ". + @xmath9 @xmath27 .",
    "+ @xmath11 @xmath28 .",
    "+ @xmath13 @xmath29 and + @xmath30 . *",
    "the most familiar example of a vector space is the  physics i \" example of a collection of objects with  magnitude and direction \" . in the usual three dimensions , the vectors are @xmath31 and the field @xmath0 is the real numbers @xmath32 .    despite this first example , it is important to realize that although the word  vector \" is frequently used to mean something with  magnitude and direction \" , in reality the idea of a vector and a vector field is a much more general concept .",
    "the following examples should make that clear .",
    "consider the field of real numbers with vector @xmath33 .",
    "this ( almost trivially ) forms a vector space .",
    "the field of real numbers with the vectors @xmath33 and @xmath34 also form a vector space ( which is the same as the vector space with field @xmath35 and vector @xmath33 ) .    as a third example , consider some arbitrary linear differential operator , @xmath36 , and two functions @xmath37 and @xmath38 which are solutions to @xmath39 .",
    "then , any linear combination of @xmath37 and @xmath38 will also be a solution .",
    "so , @xmath37 and @xmath38 form a vector space with the field @xmath32 , @xmath35 , or even @xmath40 .",
    "a final example is the set of all @xmath41 matrices with matrix addition .",
    "now , we introduce a few definitions to make some familiar ideas more precise . we begin with a definition you are likely already familiar with , that of * linear independence .",
    "the vectors @xmath42 are said to be linearly independent iff @xmath43 for example , there is no linear combination of the vectors @xmath44 that is zero unless the coefficients of both vectors are zero . *    next ,",
    "we define the * dimension of a vector space .",
    "a vector space is said to be @xmath45-dimensional if it is possible to find @xmath45 non - zero linearly independent vectors , but any set of @xmath46 vectors in the space are not linearly independent .",
    "*    finally , we define a * basis . a basis of an @xmath45-dimensional vector space is a set of @xmath45 linearly independent non - zero vectors .",
    "it is then possible to write _ any vector in the space as a linear combination of the vectors in the basis . because you should already be familiar with this from several undergraduate courses",
    ", we will not consider examples of these ideas .",
    "_ *      the fifth and final mathematical object we introduce is an * algebra .",
    "an algebra consists of a set of vectors @xmath20 , a field @xmath0 , and three operations , @xmath2 ( addition ) , @xmath3 ( scalar multiplication ) , and @xmath47 ( vector multiplication ) , subject to the following constraints : + @xmath4 @xmath48 and @xmath3 form a vector space .",
    "+ @xmath7 if @xmath49 , then @xmath50 .",
    "+ @xmath9 @xmath51",
    ". + @xmath52 . *    to make this more precise",
    ", we consider a few examples .",
    "the first is the set of all @xmath53 matrices , with matrix addition , the usual scalar multiplication , and usual matrix multiplication .    as a second example , consider the set of all _ symmetric @xmath53 matrices . in this case , the matrix product of two symmetric matrices is not in general a symmetric matrix , and therefore this is not an algebra .",
    "however , if instead of usual matrix multiplication , we define the vector product of two symmetric matrices to be @xmath54 ( anticommutation ) , then we do once again have an algebra , because the anticommutator of two symmetric matrices is a symmetric matrix .",
    "_    as a third example , consider the set of all _ antisymmetric @xmath53 matrices .",
    "this will not form an algebra with matrix multiplication because the matrix product of two antisymmetric matrices is not in general antisymmetric . however ,",
    "if we define the vector multiplication to be the commutator , @xmath55 $ ] , we once again have an algebra .",
    "also , notice that this algebra does not have an identity element , in that there is no @xmath56 such that @xmath57 = \\bf v\\it_i \\ ; \\forall i$ ] .",
    "furthermore , notice that this algebra is not even associative .",
    "clearly , it does have an identity with addition @xmath2 and scalar multiplication @xmath3 , and it is associative with both @xmath2 and @xmath3 . _    we also have the choice to impose what is typically called the * derivative rule ( synonymously called the * leibniz rule , or the * product rule ) @xmath58 * * *    if we once again consider the set of all antisymmetric @xmath53 matrices , imposing the leibniz rule with the antisymmetric matrices @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 gives @xmath62 = [ [ a , b],c ] + [ b,[a , c]]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which has the more familiar form @xmath62+[c,[a , b ] ] + [ b,[c , a ] ] = 0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] when written in this form , the leibniz rule is called the * jacobi identity , which is nothing more than the leibnitz rule . *",
    "our final definition is that of a * lie algebra .",
    "a lie algebra is the algebra of antisymmetric @xmath53 matrices which obey the jacobi identity .",
    "it turns out that this definition is actually equivalent to the one we gave in the first paper , though we will not delve into the details of the equivalence now .",
    "*    you can see that in the progression from sets to groups to fields to vectors space to algebras , we are adding a new level of structure to form each object .",
    "it should be clear from the notes proceeding this section that each of these objects is extremely useful in physics .",
    "it may seem that we are being extremely abstract .",
    "in some sense we are .",
    "but , it will be necessary to understand these concepts to at least the depths we have discussed them here .",
    "there is tremendous depth to each of these objects , but the primary definitions are all we will need .",
    "we will provide examples and outline properties as we move through the remainder of the notes .",
    "the contents of this chapter are outlined in any book on abstract algebra .",
    "we recommend @xcite for an introductory discussion of each or @xcite for a more advanced discussion of each .",
    "before we dive into the geometry , we will present some new algebraic concepts which will prove vital to geometry .",
    "in fact , you will see soon that this section is actually geometry , though it wo nt be obvious until later .",
    "we are introducing the following ideas with an intentional abstraction , which will prove useful when we begin to look at these ideas in various specific contexts .",
    "we begin with the idea of a * dual space .",
    "let @xmath20 be a ( finite ) @xmath45-dimensional vector space with field @xmath32 . clearly , we can choose some set of basis vectors ( as defined in the previous section ) , which we denote @xmath63 .",
    "we are using subscripts to label basis _",
    "vectors deliberately . _",
    "*    now , we define a new space , called the _ dual space to @xmath20 , which we denote @xmath64 .",
    "@xmath64 will also be an @xmath45-dimensional vector space according to the definition in the previous section .",
    "however , while the elements of @xmath20 are called _ vectors ( or _ contravariant vectors ) , the elements of @xmath64 are called _ covectors ( or _ covariant vectors , or _ 1-forms ) . because @xmath64 is an @xmath45-dimensional vector space",
    ", we can choose a set of basis vectors for @xmath64 , which we will denote @xmath65 .",
    "again , we are using superscripts to label basis _ covectors deliberately .",
    "furthermore , a given covector will have a well defined action _ on a vector ( which we will discuss later ) , in which a covector maps a vector to a real number @xmath32 .",
    "we can therefore define the basis vectors in @xmath64 so as to maintain the desired relationship with @xmath20 via the constraint @xmath66 where the parentheses are merely to say that @xmath67 is acting on @xmath68 .",
    "this constraint is simply saying a basis covector in a dual space is defined as the covector which maps the corresponding basis vector to @xmath69 , and all other basis vectors to @xmath70 .",
    "_ _ _ _ _ _ _",
    "_    we are only working with the basis vectors ( for now ) because we are assuming these spaces are linear .",
    "therefore , knowing the behavior of the basis vectors tells us the behavior of any element of the space .",
    "the best way think about vectors and covectors is this ; a covector _ acts on a vector , and the result is in @xmath32 . to write this in mathematical language : @xmath71 which reads ",
    "@xmath64 is the set of all linear mappings @xmath72 which take an element of @xmath20 to a real number \" . _    as an extremely simple illustration of this using familiar objects , let @xmath20 be @xmath73-dimensional euclidian space , with basis _ column vectors @xmath74 and general element @xmath75 where @xmath76 .",
    "the dual space to @xmath20 will then be the @xmath73-dimensional vector space with the basis of _ row ( co)vectors @xmath77 and general element @xmath78 where again , @xmath79 . notice that ( [ eq : dualbasis ] ) is satisfied by this choice of basis for the dual space @xmath64 . _ _",
    "so , we have a vector space @xmath20 , and given any vector in this space , we can  act on it \" with any covector in @xmath64 , where  acting on it \" in this case means the usual dot product : @xmath80 ( where @xmath81 is clearly an element of @xmath32 ) .",
    "it may seem strange to treat euclidian space spanned by column vectors and euclidian space spanned by row vectors as two different spaces , but they are in fact fundamentally different .",
    "we will see this more clearly as we proceed . for now , recall that we said that covectors _ act on vectors , resulting in a real number .",
    "notice that , following usual vector multiplication , the row vector always appears to the left of the column vector ( it is _ acting on the vector ) , as @xmath82 however , switching the order does not result in a real number : @xmath83 this is our first indication that @xmath20 and @xmath64 are in fact different spaces .",
    "_    we will continue to use the convention we have established that basis vectors have lowered indices , whereas basis covectors have raised indices .",
    "are familiar with differential geometry and/or general relativity , you are likely more familiar with ( contravariant ) vectors having raised indices and ( covariant ) covectors having lowered indices . notice that here the indices label vectors / covectors , not the components of a vector / covector .",
    "eventually , we will be using the standard notation .",
    "] it is important to realize that the column vectors and row covectors are only one example of vectors and covectors , not the _ defining example . as the examples in the last section showed there are many different types of objects that can be vectors and covectors .",
    "_    [ saidnodotproductbetweenvectors]incidentally , there is no such thing as a dot product between two vectors . that a metric provides a way of taking a dot product of two vectors",
    "however , it does this by turning a vector into a covector , so our statement here is technically true . ]",
    "rather , dot products can only be defined between vectors and covectors ( or synonymously , between vectors and @xmath33-forms ) .",
    "this is what you actually have been doing whenever you take a dot product - you are mapping vectors to @xmath32 using the dual space .    as a second example , consider the vector space where both @xmath20 and the field are @xmath32 .",
    "clearly , the dual space will be @xmath84 , because any real number multiplied by another real number will be a real number .",
    "you can see this as a consequence of the first example because a @xmath33-dimensional row vector is the same as a @xmath33-dimensional column vector .",
    "a third example is dirac s  bra and ket \" space .",
    "the kets @xmath85 are the vectors , whereas the bras @xmath86 are the covectors in the dual space . and , as you are familiar with , @xmath87 .    now , let s say we want to use another basis for @xmath20 besides @xmath88",
    ". we can switch to a new basis by simply doing a standard linear transformation with some non - singluar @xmath89 matrix @xmath90 .",
    "so , the new basis vectors will now be @xmath91 notice that the set of all possible basis vectors we can transform to is the set of all non - singular @xmath89 matrices @xmath90 , which is simply the group @xmath92 .    clearly ,",
    "if we have transformed into the new basis @xmath93 , equation ( [ eq : dualbasis ] ) will no longer hold if we use the untransformed basis for @xmath64 .",
    "so , we need to transform the covector basis as well . the obvious way to do this , while preserving ( [ eq : dualbasis ] ) , is to use the inverse of @xmath90 , or @xmath94    so now equation ( [ eq : dualbasis ] ) becomes ( using the summation convention where an upper and lower index being the same means they are to be summed ) @xmath95 which is exactly what we would expect .",
    "so , we have defined vector spaces spanned by vectors which are more or less familiar objects . then , we defined dual spaces spanned by covectors ( which are also vector spaces ) .",
    "the idea is that covectors act on vectors , mapping them to real numbers .",
    "next , we will express this idea in a more algebraic way .    as a final comment , because we have denoted the basis of a vector space as vectors with _",
    "lower indices , in order to preserve the summation convention ( where one upper and one lower index is summed ) , we denote the _ components of a vector with upper indices .",

    "@xmath111    the antisymmetry rule ( which may seem strange to demand now , but will prove very important later ) simply means that the sign changes when any two of the vectors are swapped : @xmath112 clearly , a consequence of the antisymmetry is that if any vector in @xmath103 is a linear combination of any others , then @xmath113 .",

    "we first take @xmath176 to be topologically trivial ( say , @xmath177 ) . because @xmath176 is topologically trivial , all cohomology groups ( greater than @xmath178 ) will be trivial : @xmath179 recall from sections [ sec : cohomologygroups]-[sec : meaningofnthcohomologygroup ] that the definition of the @xmath180 cohomology group @xmath181 is @xmath182 where @xmath183 is the set of all closed @xmath115 forms on @xmath176 ( @xmath115 forms @xmath184 satisfying @xmath185 ) and @xmath186 is the set of all exact @xmath115 forms on @xmath176 ( @xmath115 forms @xmath184 that can be written as the exterior derivative of an @xmath187 form @xmath188 .",

    "now let s translate this into electromagnetism in @xmath176 .",
    "consider some potential @xmath33 form @xmath200 and field strength @xmath201 form @xmath202 defined in @xmath176 .",
    "as discussed above , we can perform a gauge transformation to @xmath200 ( equation ( [ eq : gaugetransformationinformsforaharonov ] ) ) that leaves the field strength unchanged ( equation ( [ eq : aharonovgaugeleavesfunchangedinformlanguage ] ) ) : @xmath203 and because the space these fields live in ( @xmath176 ) is topologically trivial and therefore has trivial non - zero cohomology groups , we can consider any two potentials we want ( @xmath200 and @xmath204 ) and they will be cohomologous - there will be a gauge transformation that relates them to each other .",

    "_    now , however , let s let @xmath176 be topologically non - trivial .",
    "this may mean that , for example , @xmath211 this means that when the field strength is zero ( @xmath205 ) , there may be a solution to @xmath212 for @xmath200 that is not a constant ( cf example starting on page ) . and for a non - zero gauge field that is not a constant , the phase may be different at different points .",
    "an experiment has been set up involving sending particles through a double slit as usual , except behind the double slit , between the slit and the screen , there is an extremely thin solenoid ( a wire parallel to the slits that runs through the area the electrons are moving through ) with a non - zero field _ inside the solenoid , but a zero field outside it .",
    "the electrons are shielded from the interior of the solenoid . _",
    "when the field inside the solenoid is zero , the field _ and the potential outside the solenoid is zero .",
    "however , when the field inside the solenoid is non - zero , the field outside the solenoid is still zero but the potential outside the solenoid is non - zero .",
    "the effect of this is that , with the solenoid field non - zero , the space becomes topologically non - trivial .",
    "it is @xmath213 where the @xmath32 is the one dimensional space the solenoid is running through .",
    "so , because the topology is non - trivial , we can have non - constant solutions to @xmath212 , and therefore the phase of the field on each side of the solenoid need not be the same .",
    "so ( [ eq : aharonovpsisquaredisequalwhentransformed ] ) would now be @xmath214 _",
    "this experiment has been carried out , and it has been observed that the interference pattern ( which depends on the phases of the electrons ) does in fact shift when the field inside the solenoid is turned on .",
    "this affect is called the * aharonov - bohm effect .",
    "the point of the effect is that it demonstrates that at the quantum level it is the _ potentials , not the _ field strenghs , that are truly fundamental .",
    "we will see this point made in much greater force in the next paper in this series , but for now what we have said will suffice .",
    "_ _ *    there is vastly more we could say about the aharonov - bohm effect and related ideas , and anyone reading who is more familiar with the topic will likely be annoyed that we havent said more . however ,",
    "once we have the necessary machinery ( in the next paper in this series ) , we will return to this topic in much greater detail .",
    "the formalisms for electrodynamics can be found in almost any of the differential geometry texts listed in chapter [ sec : chapwithmet ] .",
    "we primarily used @xcite and @xcite , though @xcite and @xcite are also very good .    for further reading on the various applications of geometry and topology to electromagnetism",
    ", there are very interesting ideas in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it may seem strange to include a chapter on general relativity , einstein s ( classical ) theory of gravitation , in a series on ( quantum ) particle physics .",
    "but as we mentioned earlier there are several reasons it is an appropriate topic at this point .",
    "first of all we want to understand particle physics as comprehensively as possible , and a quantum theory of gravity is a necessary part of that . when we eventually get to the leading candidate for quantum gravity , string theory , it will be necessary to understand the theory we are trying to quantize .",
    "the second major reason to discuss general relativity now is that it is a very good way to illustrate the geometrical ideas we have discussed so far in this paper .",
    "providing some intuition with what we have done will be helpful when we discuss much more complicated geometrical and topological ideas later .    with that said",
    ", we will approach general relativity as follows .",
    "we will begin by discussing newtonian mechanics in the more geometrical language we have been using .",
    "then we will discuss special relativity in geometrical language .",
    "then we will discuss what lead einstein to make the leap from special relativity to general relativity , and what the consequences his theory are .",
    "therefore , we begin with newton .      simply put , classical , or newtonian mechanics is geometrically very boring - everything takes place on @xmath215 with euclidian metric @xmath216 . because we have a metric , we can define the `` distance '' between two arbitrary points ( cf section [ sec : themetricandthepythagoreantheorem ] ) : @xmath217 we take this distance to be an intrinsic part of the space , and we know that it should not change if different coordinates are chosen .",
    "for example an observer using cartesian coordinates and an observer using spherical coordinates should not report different distances between two points . nor should two observers standing in different locations .",
    "furthermore , notice that the newtonian geometry looks only at spatial dimensions .",
    "time is treated as a separate parameter , not on the same geometrical footing as space .",
    "this is why newtonian physics takes place in _ three dimensions , not four .",
    "_    also , because @xmath218 all of the connection coefficients vanish : @xmath219 and therefore ( obviously ) this space is flat .",
    "this also means that we can write out the geodesic equations very easily ( equation ( [ eq : geodesicdifferentialequation ] ) ) : @xmath220 which is solved to give straight lines : @xmath221 where @xmath222 are constants of integration depending on boundary conditions .",
    "equation ( [ eq : straightline ] ) is clearly the equation of a line and therefore we have proven the well known fact that `` the shortest distance between two points is a straight line '' ( in @xmath215 with @xmath216 ) .",
    "so at any point we can define a set of geodesics through that point ( any solution to ( [ eq : straightline ] ) that passes through the point ) , and because we know that there is no curvature , we can take the vector corresponding to any geodesic and parallel transport it to any other point in the space .",
    "because the curvature vanishes the vector at the new point will be independent of the path taken and therefore there is a _",
    "unique vector at each point .",
    "so imagine starting with a set of @xmath73 basis vectors at some point .",
    "we can parallel transport each of these three vectors to every other point in @xmath215 , thus defining a rigid coordinate system at every point .",
    "_    furthermore , the fact that all particles move in geodesics through @xmath215 , which are straight lines , is exactly equivalent to newton s first law - objects in motion stay in motion unless acted on by an external force .",
    "this is entirely contained by the statement `` in the absence of external forces objects follow geodesics '' .",
    "this notion of a `` rigid coordinate system at every point '' is at the heart of newton s view of space .",
    "this is also what motivates the classical galilean transformations between two observers moving relative to each other : @xmath223 where the observer in the primed frame is moving in the @xmath224 direction with velocity @xmath225 and their origins coincide at time @xmath226 .",
    "both observers have identical notions of time and clearly the distance between two points @xmath227 and @xmath228 will be the same : @xmath229    in summary , the geometry of newton ( @xmath215 with metric @xmath230 ) has profound implications - the fact that it is flat allows for a unique set of `` parallel '' vectors across the entire space , creating a fixed , rigid , unmoving , un - dynamical background , as well as define the straight line geodesics all particles travel along . as a result , all observers will measure the same time no matter what they are doing , and the distance they measure between two points will always be the same regardless of what they are doing .",
    "we now look to see what geometric changes einstein made in jumping from newtonian mechanics to special relativity .      in many ways ,",
    "special relativity is the clearest demonstration of the true brilliance of einstein .",
    "general relativity may demand more mathematical acrobatics , but it was the geometrical leap made in moving from newton s view of space and time to the single continuous notion of _ spacetime that was truly demonstrated einstein s genius .",
    "the fundamental idea of this paradigm shift is that , rather than all physics being carried out on @xmath215 with metric @xmath230 , physics occurs on @xmath231 , but rather than with the euclidian metric @xmath230 , instead with the _ lorentz metric @xmath232 the most obvious result of this is that time is now treated as a dimension in the geometry of the universe , rather than merely a parameter . _ _    another equally important consequence is that the simple galilean transformations ( [ eq : galileantransformations ] ) must be modified .",
    "the reason for this is that it is no longer merely the spatial distance between two locations ( [ eq : distancebetweentwopointsnewtoniangeometrysection ] ) that is preserved , but rather the _ spacetime distance between two _ events : in everything that follows . ]",
    "@xmath233 this space is called minkowsi space .",
    "the set of transformations which leave this interval unchanged is no longer ( [ eq : galileantransformations ] ) but the lorentz transformaions : @xmath234 where again the observer in the primed frame is moving in the @xmath224-direction with velocity @xmath225 and their origins coincide at @xmath226 . _ _",
    "notice that with the metric defined as above , it is possible for a vector to have positive , negative , or even zero norm .",
    "for example , a unit vector in the time direction but no component in a spatial component : @xmath235 , will have norm @xmath236 on the other hand , a vector with no time component but a spatial component , for example @xmath237 , will have norm @xmath238 and finally , consider the vector @xmath239 .",
    "it will have norm @xmath240 we call vectors with negative norm * timelike , vectors with positive norm * spacelike , and vectors with zero norm * lightlike or * null . * * * *    the geodesic equations are again very simple : @xmath220 which has solutions @xmath241 so the geodesics are again straight lines in @xmath231 .    at any point @xmath242",
    "we can choose a family of geodesics passing through @xmath100 , each of which will correspond to a vector that is either timelike , spacelike , or lightlike . notice that if an observer is on a timelike geodesic , there does not exist a continuous lorentz transformation that will transform him to a spacelike or timelike geodesic .",
    "in fact , it is not possible to use a continuous lorentz transformation to transform between _ any two of the three types of vectors .",
    "we therefore consider the manifold @xmath231 at any given point and vector to be divided into three distinct sections - the future light cone , the past light cone , and `` elsewhere . ''",
    "this leads to the well known result that all material particles travel along geodesics that are everywhere timelike ( negative norm ) and all massless particles travel on null , or lightlike ( zero norm ) geodesics . _",
    "for an arbitrary timelike geodesic @xmath243 we can find the velocity vector @xmath244 with norm @xmath245 where by assumption @xmath246 ( because we have assumed that the geodesic is timelike ) . if we introduce a new parameter @xmath247 such that @xmath248 then @xmath249 so , when parameterized with @xmath250 this timelike vector has unit length .",
    "we call this parameter the * proper time parameter .",
    "physically it is the time as measured by an observer in the same inertial frame as the observer on the geodesic @xmath251 . *    furthermore , we have @xmath252 and therefore the connection vanishes , as does the curvature .",
    "this means that for a given vector at a given point , we can parallel transport this vector to any other point in @xmath231 resulting in a unique vector at the new point . for a given observer in some location with some velocity ,",
    "the set of all observers in any location with parallel velocity are considered to be in the same inertial frame .",
    "these inertial frames are , as you are likely familiar , a central theme of special relativity .",
    "the consequence of these ideas is that there is no such thing as an absolute notion of simultaneity , no absolute notion of `` motionless '' , etc .",
    "two things can be said to be simultaneous , or motionless , relative to a given inertial frame , but nothing more .",
    "of course , the construction of special relativity has the shortcoming of being unable to discuss non - inertial , or accelerating frames .",
    "this is the domain of general relativity . before discussing general relativity ,",
    "however , we discuss one final aspect of special relativity - the energy momentum tensor .",
    "because almost no book adequately explains the meaning of the energy momentum tensor , we will build it up in steps , starting with the non - relativistic `` stress tensor '' and generalizing from there .",
    "consider some infinitesimal volume of material in three dimensional space which for simplicity we will take to be a rectangle .",
    "we take the volume of this rectangle to be @xmath253 .",
    "because the boundary of the rectangle ( a rectangular box ) is homeomorphic to @xmath254 , we can take each face of the rectangle to have an oriented area element :        we will choose the convention illustrated where the positive oriented area unit vector @xmath255 is outward from the volume .",
    "there are two types of forces that can act on @xmath253 - volume forces and surface forces .",
    "volume forces are forces that act on the entire body at once and are therefore proportional to @xmath253 .",
    "gravity and electromagnetism are examples of volume forces",
    ". the gravitational force on this infinitesimal volume will be @xmath256 where @xmath257 is the volume mass density , and the electric force is @xmath258 where @xmath259 is the volume charge density .",
    "volume forces generally very familiar and we will therefore not focus on them .",
    "surface forces are forces that act on a particular surface of the volume .",
    "the most common type of surface force is pressure , or the force per unit area .",
    "the force due to pressure is then proportional to the area element on which the pressure is applied : @xmath260    furthermore , there are two types of surface forces - pressure and shear . pressure is a force with components perpendicular to the surface :        ( we include both positive and negative pressure for clarity ) .",
    "shear force is a force with components perpendicular to the surface :        obviously in three dimensions the pressure force spans only a single dimension ( parallel to @xmath261 ) whereas the shear force spans a two dimensional space .",
    "any surface force is proportional to the area on which the force acts .",
    "we therefore consider the ratio of the force to the area , which we call the * stress .",
    "there are two types of stresses - the pressure stress and the shearing stress .",
    "the pressure stress is @xmath262 where @xmath263 is the pressure and @xmath264 is the pressure force , and the shearing stress is @xmath265 where @xmath266 is the shearing force .",
    "we can use these relationships to discuss the force per area , or in other words the force on a small area @xmath267 with unit normal @xmath261 .",
    "we will use the notation @xmath268 our goal is to write the force on the infinitesimal piece @xmath269 as a function of a given volume element , so we are looking for a function @xmath270 . *    to discover the form of this function , consider three area elements forming a triangle at any arbitrary point in @xmath253 :        from the side view , this is",
    "because this is a closed triangle , we can immediately write down the relation @xmath271    also , from both the general form of ( [ eq : stressisfpovera ] ) and ( [ eq : stressisfsovera ] ) , we can deduce that @xmath272 is proportional to the area element @xmath267 ( cf ( [ eq : fproptoda ] ) ) and therefore @xmath273 where @xmath274 is some arbitrary constant .    finally , consider the net force on this triangle from newton s second law : @xmath275 now consider an identical triangle but scale it by a factor of @xmath250 in all three dimensions .",
    "the three surface terms on the left are proportional to area and therefore they will scale by a factor of @xmath276",

    ". he could be in free fall the gravitational field of a planet !",
    "these considerations bring us to another statement of the equivalence principle .",
    "specifically , _ it is impossible to distinguish between acceleration in the absence of gravitation from remaining stationary in the presence of gravitation_.    of course , the observer in the second box realizes that if the box were very large , and he had two test masses , he may be able to determine which situation he is in .",
    "the following diagram illustrates how :     [ twotestmassesgetclosetoeachotherfornonlocalliftexperiment ]    the planet ( the circle ) pulls both the box and the test masses towards its center .",
    "if the box is big enough , the observer in the box would be able to drop the two test masses and see if they move towards each other as they fall . if the box is not sufficiently large , however , this is not possible .",
    "so , in light of this realization , we modify our statement of the equivalence principle above : _ it is impossible to distinguish between acceleration in the absence of gravitation from remaining stationary in the presence of gravitation , in a sufficiently small region of spacetime . _",
    "the equivalence principle we have discussed so far is really nothing more than a coincidence of newtonian theory .",
    "it was the similarity of equations ( [ eq : equivalenceprinciple5 ] ) and ( [ eq : equivalenceprinciple4 ] ) that lead us ( and the observers in the boxes ) to realize the equivalence of various scenarios .",
    "of course , if it turned out that gravitational mass , @xmath458 , is not equal to inertial mass , @xmath459 , newtonian theory would have no problem .",
    "we would simply have two different mass terms in ( [ eq : equivalenceprinciple5 ] ) and ( [ eq : equivalenceprinciple4 ] ) . however , countless tests have been done to test this fact , and to date there is no evidence that there is a difference . in other words , as far as we can tell experimentally , @xmath460 it was this that lead einstein to make the underlying assumption that led to his general theory . rather than take the equality of @xmath458 and @xmath459 as an interesting coincidence of newtonian theory , he decided to make it a fundamental postulate .",
    "the reason this is so important is that we can reason from what we know of the equivalence principle so far to yet another statement of it .",
    "recall from introductory physics that the force of a planet of mass @xmath461 on a test mass of mass @xmath115 is @xmath462 setting up newton s second law , @xmath463 the @xmath115 on the right side of this equation is the inertial mass - whereas the mass on the left side is the gravitational mass .",
    "but because of the equivalence principle we know that they are equal , and therefore @xmath115 divides out of the equation .",
    "@xmath464 so , the acceleration is independent of the mass of the object .",
    "this leads to the alternative statement of the equivalence principle : _ the motion of an object in a gravitational field is independent of its mass or composition_.    this statement , however , has extraordinarily profound implications .",
    "this is because , if the motion of an object in a gravitational field is independent of its mass or composition , _ it is impossible to shield any object from the effects of gravitation - in other words , gravity couples to everything_.    to see why this is so important , consider electromagnetism[pagewherewefirststartcmparinggravitytoeandminequivalenceprinciplesection ] .",
    "how can the strength of the electromagnetic field be measured ?",
    "the simplest way is simply to take two particles of known mass and composition - one that is uncharged and one that has a known charge .",
    "the uncharged particle will not interact with the electromagnetic field and we can therefore take its motion to be `` inertial '' .",
    "it is then sensical and well defined to measure the acceleration of the charged particle _ relative to the uncharged particle , and in doing so we know the force on the charged particle and through the equations of electromagnetism the strength of the electromagnetic field can be determined .",
    "_    however we do nt have this luxury with gravity .",
    "there is no equivalence principle for electromagnetism .",
    "we can not say that the motion of an object in an electromagnetic field is independent of its composition - it depends very much on the charge .",
    "we can not say that the electromagnetic field couples to everything - it does nt couple to things that do nt carry electric charge .",
    "an observer trapped in a box can tell the difference between inertial motion outside of an electromagnetic field and `` free fall '' inside an electromagnetic field by observing the motion of objects with different composition and charge .",
    "but with gravity , not only is the motion of the test object completely independent of the composition , but also it is completely impossible to shield anything from gravity to act as an `` inertial '' object . in other words , whereas with electromagnetism an uncharged object can act as the inertial object from which to compare the acceleration of the charged object , with gravity we have no such inertial objects because everything is affected by gravity .",
    "so , if everything is affected by gravity , and if the motion of everything is the same regardless of its composition , it becomes possible to set up a set of `` preferred '' world lines , or curves in spacetime , along which any arbitrary object will travel ( and are therefore _ geodesic lines ) . and",
    "because these world lines do nt depend at all on the objects traveling through spacetime , a natural conclusion is that the world lines do nt depend on the objects , but instead depend on the spacetime itself . and",
    "finally , this leads to the radical conclusion that the influence of gravity is not due to an field _ in spacetime as in electromagnetism , but rather is due entirely to properties of the spacetime .",
    "so , we have elevated spacetime from merely the background in which physics happens to a dynamical player in physics . specifically , _ the spacetime metric is not flat as in special relativity ( @xmath344 ) .",
    "rather , the motion of particles in a gravitational field are the geodesics on a curved spacetime_. _ _    this leap , from the assumption that gravity is a field like the electromagnetic field , to the assumption that in fact there is no gravitational field , but rather gravity is the effect of the curvature of spacetime , is a direct consequence of the equivalence principle , the fundamental basis of general relativity , and along with quantum mechanics one of the most radical paradigm shifts in the whole of science",
    ".    recall that in special relativity a key idea is that of an inertial frame .",
    "it is not possible ( in special relativity ) to uniquely choose an inertial frame that is `` at rest '' - in fact there is no notion of absolute rest or absolute motion .",
    "however ( in special relativity ) , it is possible to single out frames that are accelerating - there is a notion of absolute acceleration .",
    "this is what allowed us to find the strength of the electromagnetic field - we can tell the difference between non - accelerating and accelerating .",
    "but , with our new understanding of gravity , nothing can be shielded from gravity , and therefore there is no way of giving a meaningful definition of `` the acceleration due to gravity '' .",
    "however , this does nt mean that we must give up a notion of a preferred collection of reference frames .",
    "recall above that the observer in the box that is in free fall in the gravitational field will experience no acceleration , and there will be zero net force on an object in this frame .",
    "this leads to the notion that we should _ define `` non - accelerating '' as `` freely falling in a gravitational field '' . _    of course",
    ", this definition appears at first to be backwards .",
    "we are saying that an object sitting still on the surface of the earth is actually accelerating , whereas an object that is accelerating down towards the earth at @xmath465 is not actually accelerating .",
    "however it is actually the most sensible definition .",
    "recall that in our new understanding , gravity is not a `` force '' but rather represents a deviation from a flat metric .",
    "so , consider the object sitting still on the surface of the earth .",
    "free fall would dictate that the geodesic it `` wants '' to follow is the one that moves it through spacetime towards the earth s center .",
    "however , because of the normal force from the surface of the earth , the object does nt follow this geodesic . because in our new paradigm , gravity is not a force , the only true force acting on the object is the normal force of the ground . therefore , with this single force , the object is actually accelerating away from the center of the earth ! the fact that , when an observer is standing still on the surface of the earth , he _ feels the force of the earth on his feet is further evidence of this . on the other hand ,",
    "the observer freely falling in the gravitational field does nt `` feel '' any acceleration .",
    "so , our designation of free call as non - accelerating and stationary as accelerating is actually the most sensible way to think ! _    to emphasize this , recall from section [ sec : geodesics ] ff that a geodesic is the path a particle will follow in the absence of any other forces .",
    "any deviation from a geodesic is caused by an external force .",
    "so , we can take an object with no force to be an object following a geodesic .",
    "as we said , an object following a geodesic will freely fall and `` accelerate '' ( in the newtonian sense ) towards the center of the earth .",
    "because it is following a geodesic , it is nt experiencing an external force , and therefore is `` non - accelerating '' .",
    "however , the object sitting still on the surface of the earth _ is deviating from a geodesic , and therefore is experiencing an external force , and therefore is accelerating . _    as a brief comment , the previous considerations allow us to make a final observation .",
    "consider an observer in free fall in a gravitational field .",
    "this observer is by definition not accelerating , but rather is merely following a geodesic without any external forces . but",
    "according to the equivalence principle , this is absolutely identical to being in an inertial frame in the absence of any gravitational field .",
    "so , we have the conclusion that , for any gravitational field , there is a reference frame ( namely , the free fall frame ) in which _ the effects of gravity are completely non - existant_. for an observer in a free fall frame , there essentially is no gravity whatsoever , and there is no local experiment he can do to detect any gravity .",
    "so , in such a frame gravity can be completely ignored ( locally ) .    however , other forces like electromagnetism do nt have an equivalence principle , and therefore there does not exist a privileged frame frame where the electromagnetic field can be ignored .",
    "it is always possible to choose an object that is uncharged , or with a different charge , to compare one s motion to .",
    "this difference between gravity and all other forces is a particularly important quirk of the equivalence principle .",
    "we will see that it has radical physical consequences when we attempt to create a geometrical theory of non gravitational forces . the primary difference , as we will see , between gravity and the other forces is that gravity is a theory of the geometry `` of '' spacetime , whereas the other forces are theories of the geometry `` in '' spacetime .",
    "another way of putting this is that gravity involves altering the spacetime metric and consequently the metric connection is altered . in this sense general relativity",
    "is a theory of the * levi - civita connection , ( cf section [ sec : metricconnection ] ) .",
    "the other forces , on the other hand , are theories where the spacetime metric is unchanged , but the connection takes on a form _ other than the levi - civita connection - the fields create a non - metric connection on top of the metric connection . to make better sense of this , consider the rather strange example of the connection in section [ sec : otherconnections ] , with geodesics graphed starting on page . defining the connection required us to use the standard euclidian metric on @xmath466 , but we were choosing a connection unrelated to the euclidian metric . and as a result , despite the space being flat ( according to the metric ) , the geodesics were not the usual straight lines we d expect in flat @xmath466 .",
    "the meaning of this ( which we will spend the next paper discussing in much , much greater detail ) is that the connection we chose , which was not the metric connection , acted as a `` field '' which changed the geodesics the particle was traveling under . in other words , there are some particles that may `` see '' that connection and others that would nt .",
    "any particle that could see the connection would follow those geodesics . any particle that could nt see that connection would follow the usual flat space straight line geodesics .",
    "however , if the space was nt flat - i.e. if we changed the metric of the space from euclidian to non - flat , it would nt be possible for any particle to be oblivious , and all particles would follow the non - straight line geodesics . adding a field of some sort to the non - flat space would simply cause even more exotic geodesics .",
    "it is _ this that outlines the difference between gravity and the other forces .",
    "all other forces create an additional connection in addition to the spacetime metric connection , and only those particles that can see that additional connection will alter their geodesics accordingly . those particles that can not see the additional connection will ignore it and follow the geodesic any particle would follow were the additional connection not there . on the other hand , because gravity represents a deviation in the connection _ of the spacetime metric , any particle that is in spacetime ( which is , of course , all particles ) will `` see '' it and therefore the geodesics of _ all particles will be affected .",
    "this is the essential content of the equivalence principle - nothing can be shielded from gravity because gravity affects spacetime itself . _ _ _ _ *    all of this brings us to our first mathematical result of this section .",
    "we are claiming that gravity is the result of deviations from a flat spacetime metric . and",
    "therefore , the absence of `` gravity '' is actually the absence of curvature .",
    "so , in the absence of curvature the spacetime metric is flat .",
    "and therefore the geodesics are `` straight lines '' through spacetime - corresponding to solutions to @xmath467 ( cf section [ sec : geodesics ] , where the connection coefficients vanish because the metric is flat , cf equation ( [ eq : levicivitaconstraint ] ) ) .",
    "however , in the presence of spacetime curvature , the metric is not flat , and according to ( [ eq : geodesicdifferentialequation ] ) , the geodesic equations will be @xmath468 the solutions to this will obviously not be straight lines for @xmath469 .    as a brief comment before moving on",
    ", consider what we have done from a more mathematical point of view . in special relativity",
    "the underlying theme was _ all inertial frames are equivalent .",
    "mathematically this was stated as the idea that all observers related by lorentz transformations are equivalent .",
    "a lorentz transformation is defined as a transformation leaving the metric @xmath344 unchanged . in other words ,",
    "the physical statement `` all inertial observers are equivalent '' is the same as the more mathematical statement `` observers related by transformations preserving the metric '' .",
    "however , we are now allowing for transformations that _ do nt preserver the metric - the whole point is that we are considering the metric to be dynamical , and the deviations from flat are interpreted as gravity !",
    "so , we are now talking about a more general set of observers - not merely the ones who see the same metric as in special relativity .",
    "this leads to another perspective on general relativity - the * principle of general covariance * , which says that _ all observers are equivalent_. _ _",
    "this now raises the question - what causes the metric to curve .",
    "we have essentially said @xmath470 but what causes curvature ?",
    "finding the geodesic equations requires knowing @xmath471 , and finding @xmath471 requires knowing the metric .",
    "so , how can we find the metric , and what makes it curved ? when will it be flat ?",
    "in other words , @xmath472 most introductory texts or notes on general relativity will , at this point , dive into a discussion of a idea called * mach s principle .",
    "this is somewhat misleading , however , because while mach s thinking initially inspired einstein , einstein ultimately rejected the central notions of machian thought , and general relativity is not a truly machian theory . rather than",
    "discuss mach s principle , we mention some of the features that survived in general relativity . *    in special relativity ,",
    "the principle of special covariance stated that all inertial frames are equivalent .",
    "the meaning of this is that there is no such thing as absolute motion or absolute rest .",
    "no observer can be said to be truly and absolutely `` at rest '' or truly `` in motion '' .",
    "only relative velocities can be measured . however , in the context of special relativity , it is very easy to differentiate between inertial and non - inertial observers .",
    "this is precisely the limitation of special covariance - it is limited to inertial frames ( frames related by transformations that preserve the metric @xmath344 ) .",
    "einstein s leap was to reject this distinction between inertial and non - inertial frames - he said that not only is it true that motion is relative , but also it is true that acceleration is relative .",

    "the implications of equation ( [ eq : einsteinfieldequationwithkappaundefined ] ) are profound .",
    "they state that , on the one hand , the motion of matter in the universe is determined by the geometry of the universe . on the other hand the geometry of the universe",
    "is determined by the distribution of matter in the universe .",
    "we will see the results of this in several examples of solutions to ( [ eq : einsteinfieldequationwithkappaundefined ] ) later in this chapter .",
    "einstein s general relativity , as encapsulated in equation ( [ eq : einsteinfieldequationwithkappaundefined ] ) , leads us to ask two questions .",
    "the first is simply what the value of @xmath360 should be .",
    "the second is the slightly more complicated question of whether or not general relativity is consistent to newtonian gravity in the appropriate limit .",
    "we treat these two questions together because answering one will answer the other .",
    "namely , by showing that ( [ eq : einsteinfieldequationwithkappaundefined ] ) is consistent with newton s `` one over @xmath301 squared '' law , we will be able to see what the value of @xmath360 should be .    we can rewrite ( [ eq : einsteinfieldequationwithkappaundefined ] ) in terms of the definition of the einstein tensor ( cf equation ( [ eq : firstandonlydefinitionofeinsteintensor ] ) ) , getting @xmath476 we can take a trace of both sides ( contracting the indices with the metric ) and , denoting the trace of the energy momentum tensor @xmath477 , @xmath478 then , using ( [ eq : thetraceofthemetricisequaltothedimensionofthemanifold ] ) ( along with the assumption that we are working with @xmath479 dimensional spacetime ) and ( [ eq : firstandonlydefinitionofricciscalar11 ] ) , we have @xmath480 or @xmath481 we can plug this back into ( [ eq : einsteinfieldequationwithkappaundefined ] ) , which effectively swaps the role of @xmath482 and @xmath432 : @xmath483 or @xmath484    now consider a time - like unit vector @xmath485",
    ". we can contract both sides of ( [ eq : onourwaytonewtonianfromgr1 ] ) with this vector , @xmath486 on the right hand side , the first term is simply the energy density observed by someone in the @xmath485 frame ( cf equation ( [ eq : energymomentumcontractedwithavectorgivesenergydensity1127 ] ) )",
    ". we will take it to simply designate the mass density , which we will denote @xmath487 .",
    "the second term on the right hand side is the dot product of @xmath485 with itself , which is @xmath33 because we assumed @xmath485 is a unit vector ( @xmath488 ) .",
    "so , ( [ eq : onourwaytonewtonianfromgr2 ] ) is @xmath489 then , we can choose our vector @xmath485 to correspond to the rest frame of the matter @xmath432 describes , meaning that the diagonal elements other than @xmath490 vanish .",
    "then , because @xmath490 is the energy density in the rest frame of the matter , @xmath491 , and therefore @xmath492 .",
    "@xmath493 or @xmath494    now consider that the matter density is a sphere of radius @xmath301 and mass @xmath461 with uniform mass density ( so @xmath495 ) .",
    "the volume of this sphere will be @xmath496 we can take a first and second time derivative of this , getting @xmath497 now , considering this in the context of what we did in section [ sec : riccitensorsection11278943 ] , equation ( [ eq : rrdotandrdoubledotatepsilontimegoestozero ] ) tells us that the second term here vanishes , leaving @xmath498 then , plugging ( [ eq : vdoubledotequalsriccivivjtimesvsubnzero ] ) into ( [ eq : onourwaytonewtoinafromgr3 ] ) we have @xmath499 or @xmath500 or , the acceleration @xmath501 is @xmath502 this is exactly the newtonian expression for acceleration in a gravitational field if we set @xmath503 where @xmath191 is newton s gravitational constant .",
    "so , we have succeeded in not only showing that general relativity does indeed reduce to newtonian gravity in the low curvature limit , but also finding the proportionality constant .",
    "so , the full einstein field equations can finally be written as @xmath504 or if we work in `` natural '' units where @xmath505 , the more familiar form , @xmath506      there are several ways we can view ( [ eq : einsteinsfullfieldequations ] ) .",
    "the first is `` from right to left '' - they are a set of equations to give you the geometry once the matter distribution ( @xmath432 ) is known . in other words , in this view",

    "this approach , while nice in principle , is rarely practical .",
    "the einstein tensor ends up being a highly non - linear expression of the derivatives of @xmath399 , and it is almost never possible to solve it for @xmath399 directly .    the second way to look at ( [ eq : einsteinsfullfieldequations ] ) is `` from left to right '' - starting with some metric we compute @xmath475 and consequently know everything about the matter distribution by simply reading off @xmath432 .",
    "however , this is also rarely useful because it is rare that an arbitrarily chosen metric will yield a physically meaningful energy momentum tensor .",
    "it is possible that this approach results in something useful or interesting , but that is not the norm .",
    "finally , there is the way that has proven to be the most useful .",
    "typically , it is not the case that we know either side of ( [ eq : einsteinsfullfieldequations ] ) completely but nothing at all about the other side .",
    "we usually know a little about the matter and a little about the geometry .",
    "this allows us to make a simultaneous choice of the general form of @xmath399 and @xmath432 , which is called an * ansatz .",
    "einstein s equation then provides a set of constraints between the two .",
    "the example we did in section [ sec : s2otimesbbr ] is a good example of this .",
    "we were able to guess the general form of the metric in ( [ eq : s2crossrexamplemetricwithacoeff ] ) , and the form of the energy - momentum tensor in equation in ( [ eq : firstexampleansatzins2crossr1examplesection1 ] ) .",
    "we did nt have complete information about the metric or about the matter distribution , but by the ansatz we assumed we ended up with a much nicer differential equation which acted as a constraint on both sides .",
    "how this works physically should be more clear when we do examples shortly .",
    "*    so , the way we will approach problems in general relativity is to assume a form of both the metric and the matter distribution , and then plug everything in to get a differential equation .",
    "if our ansatz was well chosen , the solutions to the differential equation will give a good physically meaningful answer .      before looking at actual solutions to ( [ eq : einsteinsfullfieldequations ] )",
    "we make a few more comments about the general structure of einstein s field equations .",
    "it turns out that there is a way that ( [ eq : einsteinsfullfieldequations ] ) could be modified .",
    "this is through the addition of a * cosmological constant term , denoted @xmath507 .",
    "this term is simply added to the field equation : @xmath508 initially einstein was looking for solutions that would represent a static universe because he was unaware of the evidence that the universe had a beginning .",
    "no such static universe solution exists for ( [ eq : einsteinsfullfieldequations ] ) in a universe with matter , so he added the cosmological constant term .",
    "if the cosmological constant term is chosen in a particular way , static solutions can exist but they are unstable . with hubble s discovery of an expanding universe and the resulting big bang theory ,",
    "static solutions became unimportant and einstein rejected the need for @xmath507 .",
    "*    however , despite the initial apparent lack of necessity , @xmath507 has managed to stick around for a variety of reasons .",
    "one of the most interesting reasons is if we consider the situation with no matter : @xmath509 we can then bring the cosmological constant term to the other side , @xmath510 in this case we can interpret the cosmological as an alternative energy momentum tensor , @xmath511 .",
    "so , even in the absence of matter there is a non - zero energy momentum tensor , and we therefore interpret @xmath507 as the energy density of the vacuum .",
    "this interpretation is actually very convenient .",
    "recall from @xcite that the probability for virtual particles to appear in the vacuum is non - zero .",
    "this implies that there must be something in the vacuum which can cause this , so a non - zero energy density in the vacuum is an appropriate concept .",
    "quantum field theoretic considerations and renormalization imply that the value of @xmath507 is approximately equal to the fourth power of the planck mass @xmath512 @xmath513 where @xmath514 gev .",
    "however , observations of the universe indicate that this is incorrect , and rather the actual value of @xmath507 is smaller by a factor of at least @xmath515 - this is called the * cosmological constant problem .",
    "this is , to date , the largest discrepancy between theory and experiment in the entirety of science and is considered to be one of the most fundamental and important unanswered questions in physics . *    there is quite a bit more we could say about einstein s equation , especially about how it can be generalized .",
    "there are all kinds of terms we could add to it , but with the exception of the cosmological constant , they are almost always omitted for a variety of reasons , and we therefore wo nt bother discussing them .",
    "we are now in a position to talk about actual solutions to ( [ eq : einsteinsfullfieldequations ] )",
    ". we will begin with a discussion of the simplest case - the absence of matter , or the vacuum ( @xmath516 ) .      if there is no matter , we can take @xmath516 , and therefore ( [ eq : einsteinsfullfieldequations ] ) is ( including the cosmological constant term for generality ) @xmath517 now contract both sides with the metric , @xmath518 or if the cosmological constant is zero , @xmath519 but , in the case of @xmath520 , we also have from einstein s equation with @xmath521 @xmath522 and therefore @xmath523 implies @xmath524 the most obvious solution to ( [ eq : noenergymomentumtensorimpliesricciflat ] ) is the minkowski metric @xmath525 ( recall that we showed that the connection coefficients all vanish for the metric @xmath344 in equation ( [ eq : theconnectioncoefficientsassociatedwiththeminkowskimetricvanish ] ) , and therefore the riemann tensor trivially vanishes , and therefore the ricci tensor also trivially vanishes ) .",
    "so flat space is indeed a solution to einstein s equations in the absence of matter .",
    "we call the class of all solutions to ( [ eq : noenergymomentumtensorimpliesricciflat ] ) to * vacuum solutions to einstein s equations",
    ". and while flat minkowski space is the simplest example , there are other non - trivial examples .",
    "consider , for example , the metric near a planet .",
    "if the planet has radius @xmath526 , then a point a distance @xmath527 will contain no matter and therefore @xmath516 , but obviously the curvature will be non - flat .",
    "so there must be a vacuum solution that is not flat .",
    "we now find such a solution for the simplest case . *      we want to find the vacuum solution for einstein s equations in the vicinity of a planet . to make the problem as simple as possible",
    ", we will assume that the planet is a perfect sphere ( which is certainly not an unreasonable assumption ) with radius @xmath526 and total mass @xmath461 .",
    "this means that we can assume that the metric is spherically symmetric .",
    "furthermore we will assume that the solution is static - this means two things .",
    "first , it means that the metric does nt depend explicitly on time : @xmath528 second , it means that the @xmath529 components must vanish : @xmath530 ( if these components were non - zero then spatial displacement would involve temporal displacement , which would contradict the assumption that our solution is static .",
    "because we are working with a spherically symmetric metric we will work in spherical coordinates .",
    "the general form of the metric in spherical coordinates is @xmath531 in order to preserve the spherical symmetry , the most general ansatz we can choose is @xmath532 we can replace @xmath301 by any function of @xmath301 without disturbing the spherical symmetry , so we have the freedom to set @xmath533 without losing any generality .",
    "so , our ansatz is @xmath534 however , it will be convenient for reasons that will be clear later if we make the replacements @xmath535 and @xmath536 , making our ansatz @xmath537    we can plug ( [ eq : schwarzchildansatz1 ] ) into the equations for the connection , riemann tensor , and then ricci tensor ( a tedious exercise we leave to you , but encourage you to either work out by hand or at least write a computer program to do - it is more instructive to work this out than you might think ) , results in the ricci tensor having the following non - zero components , which when combined with ( [ eq : noenergymomentumtensorimpliesricciflat ] ) gives the following differential equations ( the prime represents a derivative with respect to @xmath301 ) : @xmath538 the first of ( [ eq : firstricciequationstogetschwarzschild ] ) implies @xmath539 so adding this to the second of ( [ eq : firstricciequationstogetschwarzschild ] ) then gives @xmath540 plugging this into the third of ( [ eq : firstricciequationstogetschwarzschild ] ) gives @xmath541    next , looking at ( [ eq : nuprimepluslambdaprimeequals0 ] ) we have @xmath542 this means that the coefficient of , say , @xmath543 in the metric can be written @xmath544 however , we assume that as @xmath545 the metric should reduce to the minkowski metric . if we take @xmath546 as @xmath547 , we get that @xmath61 must be @xmath178 .",
    "so , @xmath548    plugging this into ( [ eq : onourwaytoschwarz ] ) gives @xmath549 where @xmath59 is a constant of integration . then , using ( [ eq : nuequalsminuslambdaschwarz ] ) , @xmath550    so , finally , the metric ( [ eq : schwarzchildansatz1 ] ) is @xmath551 this solution is called the * schwarzschild metric .",
    "the first thing to notice about it is that in the limit where @xmath545 ( as we get infinitely far away from the planet ) , we have @xmath552 , and therefore ( [ eq : schwarzschildmetric ] ) reduces to the minkowski metric sufficiently far from the planet - exactly as we would expect . *      so what is the meaning of ( [ eq : schwarzschildmetric ] ) , and what is the value of @xmath59 ? to see this we need to review some introductory physics first . recall that newton s law of gravitation says that the gravitational force between a body of mass @xmath461 and a body of mass @xmath115 is given by @xmath553 where @xmath191 is newton s gravitational constant and @xmath554 is a unit vector in the direction of the vector between the objects . or , the gravitational field due to a body of mass @xmath461 is @xmath555 where @xmath280 is the acceleration an object in the field of @xmath461 will experience .",
    "we can also express this in terms of the gravitational potential @xmath556 , @xmath557    now consider a particle in the newtonian limit - moving very slowly in a gravitational field weak enough to be approximated by a perturbation from @xmath344 , and where the metric is static ( unchanging in time ) .",
    "the assumption that the particles are moving slowly means that if we are parameterizing the spacetime coordinates @xmath400 of the particles with @xmath558 , @xmath559 we therefore take @xmath560 .",
    "now the geodesic equation will be @xmath561 now , the assumption that the metric is static ( and therefore @xmath562 ) allows us to simplify the connection coefficient @xmath563 : @xmath564 next , we use the assumption that the gravitational field is weak enough to be approximated by a perturbation from the flat metric - in other words we write @xmath565 where @xmath566 is small ( @xmath567 ) .    now plugging all of this into ( [ eq : newtonainlimitschwarz1 ] ) we have @xmath568 where we neglect the @xmath569 term because , again , @xmath567 .    the geodesic equation ( [ eq : geodesicequation1onthewaytonewtonianschwarz ] ) is @xmath570 we have assumed that the metric is static and therefore its time derivative vanishes .",
    "this means that the @xmath571 component of this equation is @xmath572 which implies @xmath573    now consider the spatial part of ( [ eq : anotherrequationonthewaytonewtonianpotentialasdfasdf7 ] ) .",
    "the spatial part of the minkowski metric @xmath344 is just the identity matrix , so ( [ eq : anotherrequationonthewaytonewtonianpotentialasdfasdf7 ] ) is @xmath574 if we choose our @xmath558 parameterization so that @xmath575 , we get @xmath576 and this is @xmath577 we can recognize the term on the left hand side of this as the acceleration the particle will undergo and therefore we set @xmath578 and so @xmath579 comparing this to ( [ eq : schwarznewtonian2 ] ) , we see that we should identify @xmath580 and therefore ( finally ) , by ( [ eq : schwartzhperturbonmetric ] ) , @xmath581 where @xmath461 is the mass of the planet . obviously comparing this to our result for",
    "the schwarzschild metric in equation ( [ eq : schwarzschildmetric ] ) shows that it is identical ( we could have done similar calculations to get the radial metric coefficient as well ) .",
    "so , we can see that the value of the integration constant in ( [ eq : schwarzwherewechoose2masintegrationconstant ] ) is @xmath582    so , the true schwarzschild metric for the vacuum around a planet of mass @xmath461 is @xmath583 where we have gone back to units where @xmath505 .",
    "now that einstein s equations have given us the vacuum metric solution for a spherically symmetric static massive body , we can get down the more interesting work of seeing what this metric implies by plugging the metric into the geodesic equations .",
    "we will look at two examples of how an object will move under the gravitational influence of such a massive body , including motion around black holes and the perihelion of mercury .",
    "the fact that `` spherically symmetric '' and `` static '' is a reasonable approximation for a great deal of what we see in space lends itself to the enormous explanatory power of the schwarzschild metric , and the examples we will look at provide illustrations of some of the early experimental successes of einstein s theory .",
    "there is one quirk that can be immediately seen the form of the schwarzschild metric - namely there is a radius at which there is a singularity .",
    "note that when @xmath584 @xmath585 furthermore , note that for @xmath586 the metric has the normal minkowski @xmath587 signature . in that the sign is the relativistic distinction between a `` time '' dimension and a `` spatial '' dimension , this is a necessary feature .",
    "however , on the other side of the singularity ( @xmath588 ) , the time dimension becomes positive and the radial dimension becomes negative - in other words the time dimension `` becomes spatial '' and the radial dimension `` becomes time - like '' .    what would this value be for , say , the earth ? restoring all of the constants to standard units , the @xmath543 coefficient is @xmath589 so , the actual `` singularity '' radius is @xmath590 which obviously is nt a substantially large radius , despite the size the earth . we do nt have to worry about running into this radius accidentally . for the sun ,",
    "the value is about @xmath591 , or a little less than 2 miles . but",
    "given that the radius of the sun is more than @xmath592 miles , we do nt need to worry about running into this radius , either .",
    "but you can imagine a body with much , much greater mass than the earth , in which case the radius would be much greater . and",
    "if the mass density of the object is great enough , it is possible that this `` singularity radius '' is greater than the radius of the body .",
    "such an object is called a * black hole , and the radius we have been calling the `` singularity radius '' is called the * event horizon . * *    so what are the properties of black holes , and how do things move near them ?",
    "we can find this by considering the geodesics of the schwarzschild solution both inside and outside the @xmath584 ( with natural units again ) event horizon .",
    "let s start outside the event horizon with a particle falling into the black hole radially ( so that @xmath593 ) .",
    "we ll consider an observer watching this happen from a large distance away .",
    "the observer will parameterize what he sees with the parameter @xmath558 . to find the geodesics we use the geodesic equation ( [ eq : geodesicdifferentialequation ] ) . starting with the time ( or zero ) component ,",
    "this is @xmath594 the third term always vanishes because there is no @xmath595 dependence in any component of the metric , and the first two terms are only non - zero when @xmath543 is involved and when the derivative is with respect to @xmath596 .",
    "so , the geodesic equation is @xmath597 where @xmath598 is some integration constant and the dot represents a derivative with respect to @xmath558 . or writing this out , @xmath599    we can then assume that the parameter @xmath558 is such that the norm of the four - velocity @xmath600 has unit length : @xmath601 where we have recognized @xmath602 and used the exact form of the metric to see that @xmath603 ( cf ( [ eq : finalschwarzschildmetric ] ) ) . rearranging this , @xmath604    now , the quantity that is of interest to us is the `` @xmath301 velocity '' , or the derivative of the @xmath605 component with respect to the @xmath606 component , @xmath607 .",

    ", to the observer watching the particle fall into the black hole , he sees it take an infinite amount of time for the particle to reach the event horizon .",
    "he will watch the object fall forever .",
    "but certainly this must be incorrect ! what could cause the object to _ slow down as it gets closer and closer to something that becomes more and more attractive ?",
    "intuition ( and agreement with newton ) would demand that it move faster and faster ( relative to the black hole , and therefore relative to an observer stationary relative to the black hole ) as it gets closer and closer to the event horizon . _",
    "the solution to this apparent paradox is in the fact that we are speaking relative to what the observer _ sees .",
    "keep in mind that what the observer sees is the light reflecting from the object back to him .",
    "however , as the object gets closer and closer to the event horizon , the gravitational pull ( i.e. spacetime curvature ) gets stronger and stronger , and therefore the light rays have a harder and harder time getting back to the observer .",
    "as the observer gets closer to @xmath584 , the light is less and less able to get from the falling particle to the observer , and therefore the particle appears to take an infinite amount of time to fall in .",

    "? what will he see ?",
    "we can calculate this by simply considering the geodesic equations not with an arbitrary parameter @xmath558 , but with the proper time observed by the falling particle . in this case @xmath618 , and therefore we have ( from ( [ eq : blackholegeodesic5 ] ) ) , @xmath619 so , @xmath620 or @xmath621 if we once again take @xmath611 , notice that we wo nt have the singular behavior like we did above . rather than actually using the @xmath613 approximation we used above , let s try to integrate this directly : @xmath622 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are defined in the obvious way indicated .",

    "while this may initially seem like a bit of a cop out , let s consider the physical meaning of such an imposition .",
    "if we are to take @xmath624 , this is the same as setting @xmath625 .",
    "looking back at the definition of @xmath598 in equation ( [ eq : wherekisdefinedinblackholegeodesicsection ] ) , it is defined by @xmath626 where the dot represents a derivative with respect to the parameter @xmath558 .",
    "if we assume that the particle starts from rest a long way from the black hole ( so that @xmath301 is large ) , the value @xmath598 becomes the initial value of the @xmath627 component of the metric . and",
    "if we assume that the particle starts a long way from the black hole , we would expect it to be the value of the flat minkowski metric - it should be @xmath33 .",
    "so , not only is @xmath628 a reasonable constraint - it is in fact the _ most reasonable value for @xmath598 to take .",
    "_    with that imposed , our integral ( [ eq : blackholegeodesic6 ] ) is then @xmath629 when graphed , this gives        so , an observer falling with the particle will go right past the event horizon to be promptly crushed inside the black hole .",
    "there is , as you would imagine , volumes more we could say about black holes . but because this is merely meant to be an introduction to the basic ideas of general relativity ( which we are including largely as an illustration of the geometry we considered in the first part of these notes ) , we wo nt continue our discussion .",
    "next we consider another illustration of the applications of general relativity .",
    "but in order to appreciate this particular application , we first review ( what should be ) a familiar calculation from classical mechanics .",
    "the following several pages will be a return to entirely newtonian theory - forget about general relativity until we bring it up again .",
    "the purpose of this is to ( later ) compare the newtonian result to its relativistic generalization .",
    "we could derive the following ( newtonian ) result by using newton s laws directly , but instead we will take the lagrangian approach .",
    "the end result is the same .",
    "newton proposed the `` one over @xmath301 squared '' law for gravitation , where the force on an object of mass @xmath115 by an object of mass @xmath461 separated by a distance @xmath630 ( where @xmath554 is the unit vector in the direction from @xmath461 to @xmath115 in a coordinate system where the center of @xmath461 is taken to be the origin - note however that @xmath631 should be thought of as a position vector , not merely the radial component of a position vector ) is @xmath632 ( where we are still taking @xmath505 and the minus sign is because the force on @xmath115 is towards the origin , which is the opposite direction as @xmath554 ) .",
    "if we take an arbitrary position vector in this coordinate system to be @xmath631 , then newton s law for this system is @xmath633    now consider the angular momentum @xmath634 for this system .",
    "this will be generally defined by @xmath635 where the @xmath636 means the usual vector cross product in three spatial dimensions .",
    "consider the time derivative of @xmath634 : @xmath637 the second term vanishes because any vector crossed with itself is zero .",
    "then , plugging in newton s law for the first term , @xmath638 because @xmath631 and @xmath554 are in the same direction and therefore their cross product vanishes as well .",
    "so , we have @xmath639 so the angular momentum is conserved .",
    "this means that , while @xmath115 may rotate around @xmath461 , it will not leave the plane it starts in .",

    "equation ( [ eq : periangmomcons1 ] ) is a statement of the conservation of angular momentum .",

    "we can plug the first into the second : @xmath648    now , introduce the variable @xmath649 now , @xmath650 however , we can re - express this as @xmath651 where we used ( [ eq : periangmomcons1 ] ) and ( [ eq : pariangmomcons4 ] ) .",
    "then , @xmath652    now , plugging ( [ eq : pariangmomcons5 ] ) and ( [ eq : pariangmomcons4 ] ) into ( [ eq : pariangmomcons3 ] ) , we have @xmath653 or @xmath654 equation ( [ eq : binet ] ) is called the * binet equation , and it is a differential equation for @xmath655 whose solutions give the equation for the orbital motion @xmath656 .",
    "the solutions are @xmath657 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are constants of integration . rewriting this for @xmath526 , @xmath658 or , defining @xmath659 and @xmath660 ,",
    "@xmath661 you should recognize this as the equation for an ellipse , so long as @xmath662 . if @xmath663 this is the equation for a circle : @xmath664 if @xmath665 is between @xmath178 and @xmath33 , however , the graph is an ellipse along the axis defined by the angle @xmath60 . *",
    "the closer @xmath665 gets to @xmath33 the `` longer '' the ellipse gets .",
    "the angle @xmath60 specifies the angle where the graph comes the closest to the origin - or the point where the orbiting object @xmath115 comes the closest to @xmath461 .",
    "this location , the point of closest approach , is called the * perihelion of the orbit . *",
    "so , this shows us that according to newton s gravitational law , objects orbit planets in ellipses .    for @xmath665 greater than or equal to @xmath33 ,",
    "the graph is no longer an ellipse but rather is a parabola :        this is the case where @xmath115 comes close enough to @xmath461 for its trajectory to be affected , but not close enough for orbit or to fall into @xmath461 .    in either case , both @xmath59 and @xmath60 are constants , the mass of the planet @xmath461 is assumed to be constant , and the value @xmath646 is constant ( because angular momentum is conserved ) .",
    "so , according to newtonian gravitation , @xmath115 will move through the same elliptical orbit forever - it will never leave the plane it starts in and the perihelion will never change .    but this lead to an observational discrepancy .",
    "it was observed that the perihelion of the planet mercury was not constant - its @xmath60 value was precessing , or rotating around the sun .",
    "this type of affect could be loosely explained using newtonian gravitation once the other planets were taken into affect - it is possible for the remaining mass in the solar system to cause the perihelion of one planet to precess .",
    "however , the rate of the precession was nowhere near what newtonian theory could justify .",
    "a number of ad hoc approaches were considered , but none were successful .",
    "however , einstein showed that general relativity predicts exactly the observed precession of mercury s perihelion .",
    "we will now reproduce this calculation .",
    "the gravity of the sun , which is a spherical body , can be modeled by the schwarzschild metric : @xmath666 in ( [ eq : wherekisdefinedinblackholegeodesicsection ] ) we showed that one of the equations of motion for a particle moving near a schwarzschild body is @xmath667 = 0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we can use the geodesic equation to find the remaining equations .",
    "it turns out that while the @xmath668 equation is difficult to compute , it is not necessary",
    ". therefore , we ll start with the @xmath669 equation : @xmath670    then , finally , the @xmath671 equation : @xmath672 so , our equations of motion from the metric are @xmath673 & = & 0 \\nolabel \\\\ { d \\over d\\tau } ( r^2\\dot \\theta ) - r^2\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta\\dot\\phi^2 & = & 0 \\nolabel \\\\ { d \\over d\\tau } ( r^2\\sin^2\\theta\\dot\\phi ) & = & 0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we found that angular momentum was conserved in newtonian motion , allowing us to restrict motion to a plane .",
    "let s see if this is a solution here - consider letting @xmath674 be fixed at @xmath675 .",
    "so , @xmath676 , does not necessarily mean that all higher derivatives of @xmath674 are zero as well - we will have to determine whether or not this is the case . ] and our second equation of motion becomes @xmath677 we can take further derivatives of this equation to show that indeed all higher derivatives of @xmath674 are in fact zero .",
    "so , planar motion is in fact possible , and we can take @xmath675 exactly in all that follows .    this will make the third of our equations of motion @xmath678 where @xmath646 is the constant of integration .",
    "this is again the conservation of angular momentum .",
    "we can also integrate the first of the equations of motion to get @xmath679 where @xmath598 is a constant of integration .    now let s consider the motion of mercury using the proper time , so @xmath680 .",
    "this value for @xmath558 will make the @xmath681 , and therefore we can rewrite the metric as ( leaving @xmath682 because we have fixed @xmath674 ) @xmath683 plugging in ( [ eq : perihelion7 ] ) this is @xmath684    now we make the same @xmath685 substitution we did in the previous section ( cf ( [ eq : pariangmomcons4 ] ) ) .",
    "then , using the definition of @xmath686 along with ( [ eq : pariangmomcons9 ] ) and ( [ eq : pariangmomcons5 ] ) , we can rearrange ( [ eq : perihelion9 ] ) as @xmath687 this ca nt be easily solved , but if we take the derivative of this with respect to @xmath72 we get @xmath688 comparing this with ( [ eq : binet ] ) we can see that the left hand side is the exact same , while the right and side has the @xmath689 term .    equation ( [ eq : binet2 ] ) is the relativistic version of binet s equation . consider the ratio of the additional @xmath689 term to the constant expression from the original binet equation : @xmath690 for mercury this ratio is on the order of @xmath691 - thus the additional term is very small .",
    "because the general relativistic correction is very small we can solve the relativistic binet equation perturbatively . again sparing the details of solving it ,",
    "we merely give the solution : @xmath692 where @xmath613 is the small value @xmath693 .",
    "graphing this gives        as you can see , the motion is still elliptical .",
    "however , the @xmath694 term has the effect of shifting the perihelion by a small amount on each revolution .",
    "the value of this precessional shift predicted by general relativity lined up almost exactly with what was observed by mercury s motion .",
    "as we have illustrated , the true physics of gravity is tied up in the geodesic equations .",
    "we start with the metric , which defines the geometry of the spacetime , and then use the metric to calculate the levi - civita connection , which in turn gives us the differential equations for the geodesics .",
    "these differential equations take the place of newton s gravitational law and newton s second law ( which are also differential equations ) .",
    "we have seen that in the limit where gravity is weak , the geodesic differential equations of general relativity reduce to newton s laws . however , for strong gravitational fields there are relativistic corrections to the newtonian equations .",
    "so , whereas in newtonian physics , newton s laws provide the differential equations of motion whose solutions define the behavior of a physical system , in general relativity the levi - civita connection ( as defined by metric ) takes over to define the geodesics . and",
    "whereas in newton s laws the form of the differential equation came about from observation ( i.e. @xmath695 ) , general relativity provides a way of calculating it a priori - using einstein s field equations @xmath696 .",
    "while einstein s field equations can rarely be solved directly , the use of an ansatz ( an educated guess ) can make solving them possible , resulting in the metric in terms of the energy distribution in a region of spacetime .",
    "and once we have the metric , we are able to calculate anything else we want .",
    "d      d      d      d      d      d      before concluding this chapter we would like to tie in everything we have done with general relativity into our overall agenda with this series of papers .",
    "one reason for this is that our larger goal is to understand gauge theories .",
    "the idea of a gauge theory is that given some lagrangian @xmath384 with some global symmetry , gauging the transformation destroys the symmetry .",
    "restoring the symmetry requires the introduction of gauge fields @xmath697 which do nt transform tensorially . through minimal coupling",
    "we introduce the gauge fields into our lagrangian by replacing partial derivatives with covariant derivatives containing the gauge fields .",
    "then , so that the gauge fields do nt become merely background fields that decouple from all interactions we introduce a field strength term @xmath698 .",
    "a second reason to look at gravity as a gauge theory is that eventually we will want to talk about quantum theories of gravity . and , as discussed in @xcite",
    ", writing out a lagrangian for a theory is the first step in quantizing it .",
    "so , having a lagrangian for general relativity will be a necessary tool when we get to theories of quantum gravity .",
    "first of all , we re calling this section merely `` a first look '' because the true relationship between gauge theory and geometry is one of the most profoundly deep and rich fields in all of mathematical physics .",
    "in fact , this entire paper is merely a primer for one to _ begin learning how gauge theory and geometry converge .",
    "we will have more to say about this in the last chapter of this paper , and the next paper in this series will be a much , much more detailed treatment of geometrical gauge theory . _    before moving on with gravity as a gauge theory , we ll spend some time considering how gauge theories are generally set up for non - gravitational forces ( the standard model forces ) .",
    "this will guide our intuition for gravitation as a gauge theory .",
    "we ll do this by first reviewing the geometry of this section , and then comparing this to how gauge theories were set up in @xcite .",

    ", we replaced the partial derivative with the covariant derivative ( cf equation ( [ eq : firstexampleofacovariantderivativeofavectorfield ] ) ff ) @xmath706 then , using the transformation laws ( [ eq : gaugetheoryandgeometry3 ] ) and ( [ eq : gaugethoeryandgeometry4 ] ) , it is straightforward ( though tedious , cf equations ( [ eq : covderiviscovwithextratermthatwillvanish ] ) and ( [ eq : secondterminvarianceofcovderivderiv ] ) ) to show that @xmath707 which has exactly the tensorial form we would expect .",
    "so , by introducing the connection @xmath703 we have preserved the tensorial nature of the derivative , and in doing so allowed a derivative that compares tensors in different tangent spaces in a meaningful way .",
    "so , to summarize , the problem was that partial derivatives do nt transform tensorially in a geometrically non - trivial space : @xmath708 to fix this we define the connection @xmath703 which also transforms in a non - tensorial way : @xmath709 and then , forming the covariant derivative @xmath710 we find that @xmath711 transforms in a tensorial way .",
    "[ [ review - of - gauge - theory ] ] review of gauge theory + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    we now revisit what we did what gauge theories in @xcite .",
    "you no doubt suspect that there is a strong correlation between the geometry of this paper and the physics of the previous - if for no other reason than the fact that we have things called `` covariant derivatives '' in both places .    in a gauge theory",
    "we begin with a lagrangian @xmath384 ( or @xmath387 ) that possesses some global symmetry , @xmath712 where @xmath713 is some transformation matrix .",
    "the transformation may be a spacetime transformation , like a translation , rotation or a lorentz boost , or it may be a gauge transformation , like @xmath171 , @xmath714 , @xmath715 , etc . in either case , the field is free to `` move '' through some space , whether spacetime or gauge space .",
    "the only difference is that spacetime is considered an _ external degree of freedom where the field can move , and the gauge spaces are considered _ internal degrees of freedom where the field can move .",
    "keep in mind that gauge groups are lie groups , which are groups that correspond to a manifold - a geometrical space .",
    "so , on one hand the field can move around spacetime , but on the other hand it can `` move '' around the gauge space in the exact same way . _",
    "_    it is in this sense that we must realize that gauge theory demands the introduction ( or , the assumption ) of some very elaborate geometries .",
    "for example , consider a field whose lagrangian is symmetric under a @xmath171 transformation , like the lagrangian for a dirac spinor ( i.e. an electron ) .",
    "the field is certainly able to move around spacetime ( translations , rotations , boosts ) , but it can also change its @xmath171 phase . and because the gauge / lie group @xmath171 is topologically / geometrically a unit circle @xmath716 in the complex plane , we can envision the true space the physical field is allowed to move in as not merely the familiar @xmath717 dimensional minkowski spacetime @xmath718 , but actually the more elaborate space @xmath719 .",
    "so , the degrees of freedom of the field are spacetime translations , spacetime rotations , spacetime lorentz boosts , and @xmath171 rotations . and",
    "in demanding the theory to be relativistically invariant , we are demanding that the lagrangian be invariant under _ global translations , rotations , and lorentz boosts .",
    "consider the case of making these local - this means that the translation , rotation , or boost may change from point to point in spacetime .",
    "it should therefore be plain that the difference between a global translations , rotations , and boosts and a local translations , rotations , and boosts is exactly the difference between inertial frames and non - inertial frames ! if the way the field translates , rotates , or boosts depends on the spacetime location , that means that it may be changing speed , direction , etc .",
    "so , gauging the spacetime symmetries of the field is identically what we need to make the jump from special relativity to general relativity ( more on this later ) . _    and the same is true with making a gauge symmetry local .",
    "the field can be transformed through its @xmath171 space globally , which means that the field is altered the same at every point in space and time . by gauging the @xmath171",
    ", we are essentially allowing the field to be `` non - inertial '' in the @xmath716 part of the space it is free to move in .",
    "_ this is precisely the geometrical meaning of gauging a symmetry . _    and , whereas making the spacetime degrees of freedom local allowed for non - inertial frames which made the spacetime geometry non - flat ( cf section [ sec : theequivalenceprinciple ] ) , thus demanding the introduction of a connection ( cf the previous section as summarized in equations ( [ eq : difgeorev1])-([eq : difgeorev2 ] ) ) and curved geodesics ( cf equation ( [ eq : geodesicequationinequivalenceprinciplesection ] ) at the end of section ( [ sec : theequivalenceprinciple ] ) ) , gauging the gauge symmetry allows for `` non - inertial '' frames in the lie space , making the gauge geometry `` non - flat '' , thus demanding the introduction of a gauge field ( which is identical to a connection ) . and because the gauge fields play the role of force carrying particles , they do indeed alter the geodesics of the field .",
    "so , with gauge theory , we started with a lagrangian @xmath384 that was invariant under a global lie group ( @xmath191 ) symmetry .",
    "this is essentially demanding that all `` inertial '' frames in @xmath720 are equivalent . by gauging the symmetry we are allowing `` non - inertial frames '' in the internal degrees of freedom @xmath191 .",
    "this , as expected ( by analogy with ( [ eq : difgeorev1 ] ) ) , results in a non - linear transformation of the lagrangian , which demands that we introduce a connection .",
    "mathematically , it is identical to the connection we discussed in chapter [ sec : chapwithmet ] , physically it is a gauge field .    to illustrate this with a simple example , consider the process of making the @xmath171 local as in @xcite .",
    "we begin with the dirac lagrangian @xmath721 which has a global @xmath171 symmetry : @xmath722 so under this transformation , @xmath723 making the symmetry local had the result of adding a non - linear term when the transformation is carried out : @xmath724 to correct this , we introduced a gauge field @xmath697 which we defined to transform under @xmath725 according to @xmath726 we introduce the gauge field through the covariant derivative : @xmath727 and by replacing the partial derivatives in the lagrangian with covariant derivatives , we restore the symmetry : @xmath728    so , as outlined above , the role of the connection in non - flat geometries is absolutely and in all ways identical to the role of the gauge field in particle physics . comparing the relevant equations , with geometry we had partial derivatives",
    "transform non - tensorially ( [ eq : gaugetheoryandgeometry3 ] ) : @xmath729 whereas with gauge theory we had a non - tensorial term in our lagrangian ( [ eq : reviewofgaugetheories1 ] ) : @xmath730 notice that the non - tensorial term in both these expressions is essentially the same ( other than some constants ) .",

    "all of this was to provide the beginnings of a link between differential geometry and gauge theory .",
    "the purpose of spending several pages on this , however , was not really to enlighten you to the geometrical aspects of gauge theory ( although we hope we have at least begun to do that ) , but rather to provide some intuition on how we may proceed with making general relativity a gauge theory . as we said above",
    ", we will spend considerably more time talking about the geometry of gauge theory .",
    "but we have gone as far as we need to go down this road ( for now ) , and we return to general relativity as a gauge theory .",
    "we re going to begin this topic by coupling gravity to scalar fields . while not particularly interesting physically , this will provide a nice introduction to the topic of gravity as a gauge theory , and it will be a nice stepping stone for when we begin to study gauge theories from a geometrical context later",
    ".    we ll begin with a real scalar field with lagrangian @xmath739 as we mentioned in section ( [ sec : themodernformulation ] ) , the idea underlying general relativity is that the spacetime metric becomes a dynamic field along with @xmath72 .",
    "this means that we do nt have our spacetime geometry build in _ a priori .",
    "we therefore define the action not as the integral merely over @xmath740 , but over the invariant volume element @xmath741 .",
    "we do this by modifying our lagrangian from @xmath384 to @xmath387 where @xmath742 so , our action is @xmath743 we will , as in section ( [ sec : themodernformulation ] ) , work with @xmath387 as our lagrangian . _    we indicated above that the role of the gauge group in general relativity is the collection spacetime translations , rotations , and lorentz boosts .",
    "obviously our scalar lagrangian here is indeed invariant under such ( global ) transformations .",
    "following what we usually do for gauge theories , we would gauge the symmetry in ( [ eq : scalarlagrangianwithinvariantvolumeleementingravasgaugetheorysec ] ) , introduce a gauge field through a covariant derivative , and then include a kinetic term for the gauge field .",
    "but , it is in trying this that we run up against a small barrier - the scalar field @xmath72 transforms trivially under translations , rotations , and boosts - it has no spacetime indices .",
    "so , the covariant derivative is ( boringly ) equal to the partial derivative : @xmath744    however , as we have said , general relativity consists of making the spacetime metric a dynamical field . and , because we are working with @xmath387 instead of @xmath384 , our matter is certainly coupled to this new dynamical field ( @xmath399 ) .",
    "also couples @xmath72 to the metric .",
    "] so while we re off to an uninteresting start , we can still proceed because it is clear that our action has no term containing a derivative of @xmath399 , and therefore we have the same problem we had with the gauge fields @xmath697 - it has no dynamics .",
    "the equations of motion prevent the metric from being a dynamical field , and because the whole point of general relativity is that the metric _ is a dynamic field , we should follow what we did in @xcite and add a kinetic term for the metric . _    but we must be careful[pagewherewealsotalkaboutthedifferencebetweenyangmillsfieldsandspacetimefieldsforgrasgaugetheorysection ] . keep in mind that there is a fundamental difference between the fields @xmath697 of the standard model and the field @xmath399 - namely that @xmath697 is a field _ existing in spacetime , whereas @xmath399 _ is spacetime itself .",
    "this is our first indication that mirroring what we did for the standard model forces may not be our best bet . _",
    "_    what we need is a good guess for the kinetic term for @xmath399 .",
    "first of all , it must contain derivatives of the metric in order to be a kinetic term .",
    "second , because we are forming a lagrangian , it must be a scalar .",
    "so , what we need is a scalar that contains geometric information and also consists of derivatives of the metric .",
    "having gone through the contents of this paper , coming up with a guess should be easy !",
    "the most obvious guess for a scalar that has derivatives of @xmath399 and contains geometric information is the _",
    "ricci scalar , @xmath745 , a quantity naturally provided by differential geometry .",
    "so , our guess for the term we add to the lagrangian to give the metric dynamics is @xmath746 where the @xmath192 in the subscript stands for hilbert , who was the first to propose this action .",
    "now , if we denote ( [ eq : scalarlagrangianwithinvariantvolumeleementingravasgaugetheorysec ] ) the `` matter lagrangian '' , @xmath747 , our total action is @xmath748 where @xmath360 is some constant of proportionality . _    from sections [ sec : themodernformulation ] and [ sec : themeaningofthemodernformulation ] ( specifically equation ( [ eq : fundamentalexpressionofenergymomentumtensor ] ) ) we know that the variation of the matter part of this action with respect to the metric will result in the energy momentum tensor . so what will the variation of @xmath526 with respect to @xmath399 give ?",
    "we ultimately want to find @xmath749 , where @xmath750 and @xmath751 \\longrightarrow s_h[g_{\\mu\\nu}+\\delta g_{\\mu\\nu } ] = s_h[g_{\\mu\\nu } ] + \\delta s_h[g_{\\mu\\nu}]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so that @xmath752 = s_h[g_{\\mu\\nu}+\\delta g_{\\mu\\nu } ] - s_h[g_{\\mu\\nu}]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so , writing this out , @xmath753 we ll start with the last term , @xmath754 .",
    "recall that the ricci tensor @xmath482 is a contraction of the riemann tensor , so @xmath755 then , using the definition of the riemann tensor ( [ eq : equationofriemanncurvaturetensor ] ) , this is @xmath756 the obvious step at this point would be to write out the connection coefficients in terms of the metric @xmath399 to get the variation .",
    "this approach works just fine , but instead we will take a simpler ( and more clever ) approach .    consider the variation of the connection @xmath757 . by definition",
    "this comes from @xmath758 \\longrightarrow \\gamma^{\\rho}_{\\mu\\nu}[g_{\\alpha\\beta } + \\delta g_{\\alpha\\beta } ] = \\gamma^{\\rho}_{\\mu\\nu } [ g_{\\alpha\\beta } ] + \\delta \\gamma^{\\rho}_{\\mu\\nu } [ g_{\\alpha\\beta}]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and so @xmath759 = \\gamma^{\\rho}_{\\mu\\nu } [ g_{\\alpha\\beta}+\\delta g_{\\alpha\\beta } ] - \\gamma^{\\rho}_{\\mu\\nu } [ g_{\\alpha\\beta}]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now , while it is true that @xmath757 is not a tensor , we pointed out in section [ sec : torsionandliederiv ] that the _ difference between two connections is a tensor .",
    "we can therefore take @xmath760 to be a type @xmath761 tensor . and",
    "because it is a tensor , we can take a covariant derivative . using the generalized form of the covariant derivative , equation ( [ eq : mostgeneralcovderoftensorpossible ] ) .",
    "this is @xmath762 _",
    "now consider the difference in two such terms : @xmath763 comparing this to ( [ eq : deltarprhomurhonu ] ) we see that they are the same !",
    "so , @xmath764    so , the last term in ( [ eq : deltashilbertequals0 ] ) is now @xmath765 then , using the fact that the covariant derivative of the metric vanishes by definition ( cf equation ( [ eq : covderivofmetriciszeroparforgravasgaugesecpar ] ) ) , this is @xmath766 this is an integral over a total ( covariant ) derivative and therefore is equal to a boundary term which we can take to be zero ( as we always do in physics ) .",
    "so , the expression we are trying to find , ( [ eq : deltashilbertequals0 ] ) , is now @xmath767 we now work with the first term .",
    "evaluating this requires the use of ( [ eq : variationofsquarerootofabsolutevalueofmetricwithrespecttometric ] ) : @xmath768 from which it is clear that @xmath769",
    "so , we can now write ( [ eq : gravasgaugetheorydeltassubhequationwearetryingtosolveequaltozero ] ) as @xmath770 notice that the metric variation part of the first term has lowered indices whereas the metric variation in the second term has raised indices .",
    "we correct this using ( [ eq : thetraceofthemetricisequaltothedimensionofthemanifold ] ) : @xmath771 and therefore , finally , @xmath772 where @xmath475 is the einstein tensor ( cf equation ( [ eq : firstandonlydefinitionofeinsteintensor ] ) ) .",
    "so , amazingly , the the equation of motion for the hilbert action without a matter lagrangian is ( for arbitrary @xmath773 ) is @xmath774 which is einstein s equation in the absence of matter , as expected ( cf equation ( [ eq : einsteinsfullfieldequations ] ) ) .    or ,",
    "if we use the full action ( [ eq : fullgractionforscalarfieldincludinghilbertterm ] ) , @xmath775 so , if we use ( [ eq : definitionofkappaineinsteinfieldequation ] ) to get the appropriate value for @xmath360 , we have einstein s field equation exactly ( cf equation ( [ eq : einsteinsfullfieldequations ] ) ) : @xmath776 thus , we have confirmed that the hilbert action is the correct term for the dynamics of the metric , as well as that @xmath777 is the correct action for scalar fields and gravitation .",
    "we would now like to move on to writing a lagrangian coupling fermions to spacetime via general relativity so as to give fermions gravitational interactions .",
    "doing this , however , requires a bit of formalism first .",
    "thinking back to chapter [ sec : differentialmanifolds ] , recall that part of our definition of an @xmath114-dimensional differentiable manifold @xmath356 was that , on some patch of the manifold that is ( locally ) homeomorphic to and open subset of @xmath208 , we can define coordinate functions @xmath778 which map points @xmath779 into @xmath208 : @xmath780 of course it may not always be possible to cover the entirety of @xmath356 with a single coordinate neighborhood , and therefore there may be neighborhoods on @xmath356 that are covered by two different coordinate functions - say @xmath778 and @xmath781 .",
    "we then demanded that the function @xmath782 be infinitely differentiable and have infinitely differentiable inverse .",
    "this was the primary content of section [ sec : formaldefofmanifolds ] .",
    "then in section [ sec : tangentspacesandframes ] and following we discussed the tangent space and cotangent space , which were copies of @xmath208 , which were attached at every point of @xmath356 .",
    "we then showed that in some neighborhood of @xmath356 ( that is homeomorphic to an open subset of @xmath208 ) , we can use the coordinate functions to define frames , or bases , for these spaces .",
    "namely , @xmath783 spans the tangent space , whereas @xmath784 spans the cotangent space . of",
    "course these bases satisfy @xmath785    we have been able to make considerable progress considering such frames , or bases , of tangent spaces . however , there is no _ a priori reason from choosing a tangent space basis that coincides with the coordinates in this way . as you should be well aware from linear algebra ,",
    "_ any basis of @xmath208 is just as good as any other , and we are therefore free to choose whatever basis we want . _ _    with that said , we will therefore consider tangent and cotangent space bases that are not based on the coordinate functions - such frames are aptly called * non - coordinate bases .",
    "returning to the notation where a greek index indicates a spacetime index , let s make the switch from a basis @xmath786 to some other basis .",
    "we ll call the new basis @xmath787 , where the latin index ( instead of a greek index ) is because this basis does nt have any relation to the spacetime coordinates . of course , because all bases are equally good as any other , we can write the new basis at any point as a linear combination of the coordinate basis . in other words",
    "we can write @xmath788 when written this way , the non - coordinate basis has both a spacetime index and a non - coordinate basis index ( more on this later ) .",
    "the lower latin index labels the non - coordinate basis vector , while the upper greek index labels the spacetime ( manifold ) component of that basis vector .",
    "*    we can then demand that the non - coordinate basis be orthonormal at each point according to whatever orthonormal may mean on that manifold .",
    "for example , if we are working on a space with an euclidian metric signature , the inner product between any two of the non - coordinate basis vectors will be ( cf equation ( [ eq : generalformofmetricinnerproduct ] ) ) @xmath789 whereas if the metric has a lorentz signature , this is @xmath790 the nomenclature typically used for such an orthonormal non - coordinate basis @xmath787 is a * vielbein . and",
    ", just as it is nt always possible to use a single coordinate system to cover a manifold and therefore is nt always possible to use a single coordinate basis for every point on the manifold , it may not be possible to use a single vielbein to cover an entire manifold .",
    "we will therefore need to talk about transformation laws between vielbein s on coordinate neighborhood overlaps .",
    "*    note that a vielbein is a very simple idea - we havent done anything profound here .",
    "all we re doing is renaming things , nothing more .",
    "make sure you understand the simple nature of what we ve done in this section so far before moving on - if it seems complicated at all then you re missing something .",
    "moving on , we can of course invert ( [ eq : noncoordbasis1 ] ) : , which forms an @xmath53 matrix , is invertible - we will assume this from now on . ] @xmath791 where we have introduced the inverse vielbein , which has the spacetime lowered and the non - coordinate index raised ( the opposite of the vielbein ) .",
    "the inverse obviously satisfies @xmath792    we can also use the inverse vielbein to invert ( [ eq : noncordbasis2 ] ) and ( [ eq : noncordbasis3 ] ) : @xmath793 or @xmath794 these are extremely powerful relationships between the vielbein s and the spacetime metric - namely they make obvious that the metric can be written in terms of the vielbein and the flat space metric exactly .    furthermore , the inverse vielbein allows us to write a non - coordinate basis for the cotangent space : @xmath795 or inverting this , @xmath796 obviously this preserves the relationship ( [ eq : noncordbasis4 ] ) : @xmath797    we will from now on drop the @xmath798 notation from the inverse vielbein .",
    "it should be understood that when the greek index is lowered and the latin index is raised it is inverse , whereas when the greek is raised and the latin is lowered it is not the inverse .",
    "next , note that we can express any arbitrary vector in terms of the vielbein .",
    "consider the vector ( in terms of the coordinate basis ) @xmath799 .",
    "in addition to switching the coordinate basis as in ( [ eq : noncordbasis5 ] ) , we can write the components of @xmath800 as @xmath801 the vector is then @xmath802 of course plugging in the known values for each of these terms recovers the original vector : @xmath803    we can do this same thing for an arbitrary tensor . for example , we can write @xmath804 we want to reiterate at this point that there is nothing profound or even particularly interesting about what we are doing . we are merely relabeling things - nothing more .    however , we are now able to begin to get into the real meat of using a non - coordinate basis , or a vielbein - transformation laws .",
    "what is particularly interesting is that , because the vielbein is completely independent of the spacetime manifold coordinates , it can be transformed independently of the spacetime coordinates . in other words",
    ", we can transform the latin indices without worrying about the greek indices .",
    "the meaning of this is that we re changing the vielbein without changing the coordinate functions .",
    "keep in mind that a vielbein makes no reference whatsoever to the spacetime manifold coordinates . and",
    "therefore at a given point on the spacetime manifold , in choosing a vielbein , we are choosing a completely arbitrary set of basis vectors that do nt have anything whatsoever to do with the coordinates .",
    "therefore , changing , or transforming , to some other completely arbitrary set of basis vectors that also have nothing whatsoever to do with the coordinates does nt require that we think about the coordinates . in a sense , by working with the vielbein",
    "we have `` lifted '' ourselves from the manifold into another space .",
    "to see what this space is , keep in mind that the only rule we are imposing for the vielbein is equation ( [ eq : noncordbasis3 ] ) - the vielbein must be orthonormal at each point .",
    "so , the only constraint is that the vielbein we transform to must be orthonormal .",
    "therefore , we can make absolutely any transformation on the vielbein that preserves the relationship ( [ eq : noncordbasis3 ] ) . in other words , we are allowed any transformation that preserves the minkowski metric - and we know exactly what types of transformations these are - lorentz transformations !",
    "so , given any vielbein at any point ( which , of course , has nothing to do with the spacetime coordinates at that point ) , we can transform that vielbein to any other vielbein as long as the transformation is a lorentz transformation _ on the latin vielbein indices .",
    "so , denoting lorentz transformations on the vielbein as @xmath805 , this means @xmath806 and in order to preserve ( [ eq : noncordbasis7 ] ) we have @xmath807 and , as we have said repeatedly , no such transformation has any affect on the actual spacetime coordinates , and therefore no spacetime indices need to be transformed . in other words , these lorentz transformations are completely _ internal .",
    "for example in ( [ eq : noncordbasis5 ] ) , this internal lorentz transformation will take @xmath808 so , indeed it is the case that transformation on this _ internal space have no affect on anything in spacetime .",
    "furthermore , it should be clear that the internal space we are working with is specifically the space of all lorentz transformations on the vielbein space !",
    "in other words , it is as if we have attached a copy of the lorentz group @xmath809 to every point on the spacetime manifold , and so by performing a lorentz transformation on the vielbein at every point , we are assigning an element of the lorentz group to every element of spacetime . in other words ,",
    "what we have is a local , or gauged , lorentz group . _",
    "_ _    furthermore , just as the internal vielbein transformations do nt have any affect on coordinate transformations , transformations that take place on the spacetime indices do nt have any affect on the vielbein coordinates .",
    "speaking more physically , as we have said the vielbein at a particular point has absolutely no relation to the coordinates .",
    "therefore changing the coordinates should obviously have no affect on the vielbein .",
    "such a spacetime coordinate transformation will only act on the greek spacetime indices .",
    "so , looking at ( [ eq : noncoordbasis1 ] ) , we have for arbitrary coordinate transformation @xmath810 : @xmath811    as interesting as all this may be , it is still the case that we ve done little more than complicated our notation .",
    "we have demonstrated via transformation laws that there is a rich geometrical structure in using the vielbein s ( namely attaching a copy of @xmath809 to every point on the manifold ) , but anything we can write with spacetime indices we can write with vielbein indices and vice versa .",
    "however , the real divergence in the two notations comes when we try to take derivatives .",
    "as usual , when working with arbitrary manifolds there is no automatic way to compare tensors in two different tangent spaces , and we therefore must include a connection term to form the covariant derivative . but consider the vector in vielbein coordinates rather than spacetime coordinates .",
    "this takes on values in vielbein space @xmath809 , not in spacetime .",
    "therefore , while the covariant derivative will still need a connection , it clearly ca nt simply be the spacetime metric s levi - civita connection @xmath757 .",
    "instead , we introduce a connection that `` lives '' on the vielbein space , @xmath812 ( note that it has one spacetime index and two internal vielbein indices ) . because this is a connection with reference to the _ internal space of lorentz transformations , which are actually just rotations",
    ", we call this connection the * spin connection .",
    "then , we take the covariant derivative of @xmath813 using the spin connection : @xmath814 or , more generally ( cf ( [ eq : mostgeneralcovderoftensorpossible ] ) ) @xmath815 * _    or , if we had an expression with both a greek spacetime index and a latin internal vielbein index , like @xmath816 , the covariant derivative would be @xmath817 where @xmath471 is the levi - civita connection .",
    "now , the whole point of a tensor quantity is that it does nt depend on how it is written - this ties into the fundamental law of physics that physics should nt depend on how we choose to describe the universe .",
    "therefore there should be some relationship between the spin connection and the levi - civita connection .",
    "in other words , there should be a way to relate the following covariant derivatives @xmath818 because they are saying the exact same things .    to find this relationship ,",
    "first consider a vector field written in out in an index free fashion : @xmath819 now do the same thing but use a vielbein index on the vector : @xmath820 now transform the vielbein index back into a spacetime index : @xmath821 then , because the tensorial nature of physics demands that @xmath822 be the same no matter how we describe things , we must have @xmath823 from this we get @xmath824 or dropping the @xmath825 common to each term , @xmath826 or , inverting this , @xmath827    so , the complete covariant derivative of a vector field @xmath354 written in the vielbein basis is @xmath828    recall that the point of a covariant derivative is to ensure that the derivative term transforms covariantly , or in a nice tensorial way .",
    "this allows us to see what the transformation law for the connection must be . under a spacetime coordinate transformation",
    "it should be clear that there will be no problems - the derivative is nt acting on anything with a spacetime index and therefore we wo nt get any additional terms .",
    "this tells us that the spacetime index on the spin connection @xmath812 transforms tensorially .",
    "however , under an internal vielbein lorentz transformation , there will be an additional term because the partial derivative acts on the @xmath813 , which has an internal latin index .",
    "so , assuming that the transformation law for the spin connection is a tensorial term plus a non - linear term ( as usual ) , it will be @xmath829 ( where @xmath830 is the term we want to find ) , we can write the transformation for the covariant derivative as @xmath831 so , we get a covariant transformation as long as the last term vanishes : @xmath832 or @xmath833 and so the spin connection transforms according to @xmath834 under an internal lorentz transformation .",
    "we now have the tools to discuss how fermions can be coupled to gravity .      we have done the bulk of the work necessary to couple fermions to spacetime in the previous sections , and we will therefore treat this topic briefly . we know that after gauging the symmetry and introducing a covariant derivative we will need a field strength .",
    "we worked out what this will be in section [ sec : gravitycoupledtoscalarfields ] - the hilbert lagrangian @xmath746 where @xmath526 is the ricci curvature scalar .",
    "next , we look at the lagrangian for a dirac fermion ( including the invariant volume form part ) : @xmath835    as discussed above in the review of gauge theory part of section [ sec : relationshipbetweengaugetheoryandgeometryafirstlook ] , the gauge group for general relativity will be the lorentz group .",
    "we ll walk through the usual steps in gauging this symmetry with hopes that doing so makes our exposition easier to follow .",
    "the fermions will transform under the spinor representation of the lorentz group ( cf @xcite , section 3.1.5 ) , called the * spinor representation , and we denote a general lorentz transformation in the spinor representation as @xmath836 : so @xmath837 so , under a _ global lorentz transformation the dirac lagrangian ( [ eq : grferm1 ] ) will transform as @xmath838 so , @xmath839 is indeed invariant under a global lorentz transformation . _ *    however , if we gauge the symmetry and let @xmath836 depend on spacetime ( a _ local lorentz transformation ) , we have ( suppressing the @xmath840 for notational simplicity ) @xmath841 which as expected has a non - linear term that we need to cancel .",
    "we achieve this cancellation by introducing a connection , or a gauge field , via a covariant derivative .",
    "we assume the form of this covariant derivative to be @xmath842 where @xmath843 is the connection we have yet to determine .",
    "_    however it is at this point that we need to be careful .",
    "the close analogy we have been maintaining between the differential geometry developed in this paper the gauge theory formalism we developed in the previous paper would indicate that because we are coupling the fermions to spacetime , we should use the connection of spacetime , the levi - civita connection @xmath757 as our gauge field .",
    "however this turns out to be incorrect .",
    "the reason this is incorrect is that the levi - civita connection acts on vectors with a spacetime index .",
    "for example in section [ sec : connections ] ( i.e. equation ( [ eq : firstexampleofacovariantderivativeofavectorfield ] ) ) the levi - civita connection was being used to form the `` gauge field '' , or covariant derivative , for a vector with indices relating to the coordinates of the manifold .",
    "but our fermion fields @xmath130 and @xmath172 do nt have spacetime manifold indices . as we discussed in @xcite ,",
    "the degree of freedom of a fermion , called spin , is not a rotation through spacetime .",
    "rather , it is a rotation through `` spinor space '' .",
    "this is an _ internal degree of freedom .",
    "therefore the levi - civita connection is not the tool we need ( at least , not exactly ) . _    however , as you no doubt have realized , this idea of an internal degree of freedom can be handled extremely well with the vielbein formalism developed in the previous section ( [ sec : noncoordinatebases ] ) .",
    "the essential idea of that section was to introduce a vielbein , or basis at each point that was unrelated to the coordinates of the spacetime manifold , and by writing quantities in terms of the vielbein , we were working with an internal space .",
    "this lead to the notion of a spin connection which allowed us to form a covariant derivative for objects that had no spacetime index but rather had an internal index . and",
    "that is _ exactly what we have with fermions !",
    "they have no spacetime index[theyhavenospacetimeindexbuttheyhaveaninternalindex ] , but they have an internal _ spin index .",
    "therefore , by simply replacing @xmath805 from section [ sec : noncoordinatebases ] with the spinor representation of the lorentz group , @xmath844 , we can form a covariant derivative for @xmath130 . _ _",
    "first , we note that like any transformation , we can write a lorentz transformation @xmath433 as the exponentiation of the lorentz algebra generators ( where the generators are the spinor representation generators ) , which we denote @xmath845 . so @xmath846 ( the factor of @xmath847 is conventional ) where @xmath848 are the parameters for the lorentz transformation . will be an antisymmetric @xmath849 matrix , which has 6 real independent components corresponding to three rotations and three boosts . ]    then , working with the spin connection for our internal spinor space , we expand the connection in terms of the generators ( from ( [ eq : grferm2 ] ) ) : @xmath850 ( where we have lowered one of the indices on the generator matrix to keep our notation on the spin connection consistent with the previous section - this is no problem because we can of course raise and lower indices at will with the metric .",
    "so , our covariant derivative is @xmath851 we leave it to you to show that replacing the partial derivative in @xmath839 with ( [ eq : grferm5 ] ) along with the transformation for the spin connection ( [ eq : grferm6 ] ) exactly cancels the non - linear term , making @xmath839 with the spin connection covariant derivative invariant under the local lorentz transformation .",
    "so , finally , we can write out the action for fermions coupled to gravity : @xmath852 or for a theory containing both scalar fields and bosons , @xmath853      the primary general sources for this chapter were @xcite and @xcite .",
    "most of the discussions of the meaning of the various concepts came from @xcite .",
    "the discussions of the equivalence principle and newtonian correspondences came from @xcite .",
    "the discussions of solutions to the geodesic equations came from @xcite .",
    "we following @xcite to find the schwarzschild solution .",
    "we followed @xcite and @xcite in discussing the stress tensor and energy momentum tensor , and @xcite in deriving the modern formulation of the energy momentum tensor . for general relativity as a gauge theory we used @xcite and @xcite .    for further reading in special relativity",
    "we recommend @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "for further reading in general relativity we recommend @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite",
    "we ll conclude with a few comments relating to the gauge theory of general relativity that , while not necessary to understanding einstein s class theory or the derivation or meaning of ( [ eq : fullgrasgaugetheorylagrangianscalarsandfermions ] ) , will help tremendously in preparing us for where we are going with this series .",
    "you may have noticed that we did a slight slide of hand in our derivation of the spin connection in the previous section .",
    "specifically , on page , we pointed out that the similarity between the `` internal '' spinor space and the `` internal '' vielbein space of section [ sec : noncoordinatebases ] ( in the paragraph beginning with `` however , as you no doubt ... '' ) .",
    "but , recall that the idea of a vielbein was that @xmath854 forms a basis for the _ tangent space of the manifold .",
    "they are nothing more than spacetime vectors defined at a point - and obviously the spinor space is not the same as a tangent space .",
    "so we made a fundamental change from section [ sec : noncoordinatebases ] to section [ sec : gravitycoupledtofermions ] .",
    "_    recall that in section [ sec : noncoordinatebases ] we commented that by introducing the vielbein we have , in essence , attached a copy of the lorentz group @xmath809 to every point on the spacetime manifold @xmath356 .",
    "however , this additional space arose naturally , even necessarily , from the fact that the basis for the tangent space at a point is completely arbitrary and any basis will work as well as any other , and therefore the @xmath809 in this framework acts on the basis _",
    "vectors , and is therefore the vector representation of @xmath809 , not the spinor representation .",
    "however with the vielbein that lead to the spin connection , the internal indices are not simply elements in the tangent space - they are in spinor space . and , unlike the tangent space which arises necessarily from the manifold ,",
    "the addition of a spinor space is somewhat artificial - there is no pre - existing reason to add a spinor space to a manifold .",
    "_    so , let s take stock of what we have .",
    "we have a manifold , and naturally associated with the manifold is a tangent space and a cotangent space",
    ". then there are tensors of various ranks that can live in the tangent and cotangent space . in order to take the derivatives of tensor fields on the manifold",
    "we must be able to compare tensors in different tangent spaces .",
    "we do this by introducing the levi - civita connection through the covariant derivative .",
    "the covariant derivative then replaces the partial derivative for differentiating tensor fields that live in the vector and covector space of the manifold .",
    "also , as a direct result of the structure of the tangent space at every point of the manifold , we have a symmetry associated with our ability to choose any basis of the tangent space at each point .",
    "all that is required is that the basis be orthonormal - this leads to the symmetry being @xmath809 ( or @xmath855 for arbitrary manifold with lorentz signature and @xmath856 for arbitrary manifold with euclidian signature ) .",
    "we can treat this @xmath809 etc . as an _ internal degree of freedom , but again this degree of freedom has arisen very naturally from the structure of the manifold - no new ideas are introduced in arriving here . then , as we saw , we can express any spacetime tensor , rather than in terms of the manifold coordinates , in terms of this internal `` vielbein '' space . again , doing this does nt require any new ideas - this has all risen naturally from the structure of the manifold . _    on the other hand , as we have shown via the spin connection , we can go through all of this again but in a way that does nt arise naturally from the structure of the manifold",
    ". we can start with some manifold with all the same things as above ( tangent and cotangent spaces , tensors , a tangent space induced vielbein space , etc . ) .",
    "but , we may then introduce something other than merely the transformation group on the tangent space basis vectors .",
    "we may introduce , say , the spinor representation of @xmath809 as we did in the previous section , or we may introduce absolutely any other space we want .",
    "we may write a basis at each point for our `` artificial '' space we ve attached .",
    "we can then express any element of this space in terms of the basis we have chosen at each point .",
    "so we have two different types of `` things '' attached to our manifold .",
    "one is the tangent / cotangent space structure which arises naturally and is automatically built in to our geometry .",
    "the other is a somewhat `` artificial '' space we attach to the manifold . in both cases we can talk about fields `` living '' in a vector space that is defined at every point of the manifold .",
    "introducing some new notation , we will refer to the former the * tangent bundle ( which consists of the tangent space , the cotangent space , and all the higher dimensional tensor spaces resulting from this in the natural way ) , and the latter `` artificial '' spaces will be referred to as * fibre bundles . *",
    "*    looking back to page in section [ sec : tangentspacesandframes ] , we briefly mentioned this idea . specifically ,",
    "if our manifold is @xmath356 , the tangent bundle @xmath857 is the product @xmath858 ( cf equation ( [ eq : firsttimewementionthetangentbundlethisisforgrasgaugetheoyrsection ] ) ) . for these more general fibre bundles we are introducing now ,",
    "if the space we are artificially attaching is denoted @xmath859 , the total space is ( sort of - but more on that ( including what that means ) later . _ _ ] ) @xmath860 . and",
    ", just as an individual element of the tangent bundle is a single tangent space at a point , a single element of the fibre bundle is a single * fibre at a point .",
    "so , the copy of @xmath859 at @xmath779 is the _ fibre at @xmath100 .",
    "the underlying manifold @xmath356 is called the * base space of the total structure , which we call the * total space . * * _ *",
    "another important point is that the total spaces , consisting of the base space , the tangent bundle , and the fibre bundles , can genuinely be viewed as single larger spaces",
    ". as we will see , the details on how everything works together can be very complicated , but it is still the case that these total spaces are well defined geometries that we can view as a single geometrical object .",
    "we also mentioned on page the idea of a * projection map .",
    "the idea was that , at a given point @xmath779 there is a copy of the tangent space @xmath208 , and therefore any tangent vector at @xmath100 , denoted @xmath861 , can be `` projected '' to the point of @xmath356 the vector is attached to - or in other words @xmath800 is projected to the point of @xmath356 such that @xmath862 .",
    "we call this projection map @xmath863 : @xmath864 then , we can use the inverse of @xmath863 at every point to recover the entire tangent space : @xmath865 *    we will make extensive use of the same idea for general fibre bundles . at every point @xmath779 we can attach the vector space @xmath859 .",
    "then , some element @xmath866 cane be projected down to the point to which it is attached with @xmath863 , and from @xmath779 we can recover the entire fibre : @xmath867    again , we want to emphasize that the _ difference between what we are calling the tangent bundle and fibre bundle is that the tangent bundle is intimately associated with the base space manifold , whereas the fibre bundle is not - the fibre bundle is defined entirely independent of the base space .",
    "so , a total space @xmath868 with base manifold @xmath356 , tangent bundle @xmath857 , and fibre bundle @xmath859 may be written part of this may only _ locally have a @xmath859 attached to it in this way - for now do nt worry about it .",
    "we just want to mention this for readers who already have some familiarity with these concepts . _ ] @xmath869 or , if we want , we can attach multiple fibre bundles : @xmath870",
    "you can likely imagine that the total space @xmath871 which is of course viewed ( in this paradigm ) as a single geometrical space , is particularly interesting .",
    "_    as we noted in section [ sec : noncoordinatebases ] , an arbitrary vector with spacetime indices @xmath354 can be written in terms of the vielbein indices , @xmath872 .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the fact ( that we have repeated several times in this section ) that the vielbein space is a direct consequence of the manifold itself and is intimately tied to it . for an arbitrary fibre bundle , however ( as we have also repeated several times in this section ) , there is absolutely no necessary correlation whatsoever between the geometry of the base manifold and the geometry of the fibre .",
    "therefore it is nt in general possible to write a spacetime vector in terms of the basis for the fibre .",
    "this brings us to the notion of two fundamentally different types of fields ( cf the comparison between gravity and electromagnetism starting on page in section [ sec : theequivalenceprinciple ] )    the first type of field are the fields we have been discussing all along in these notes - tensor fields that have spacetime indices .",
    "these are fields that live in the @xmath857 and the higher dimensional tensor spaces that we form naturally from @xmath857 .",
    "vectors , forms , matrices , and so on - anything with a spacetime index is such a field .",
    "again , these are fields that `` live '' in the tangent and cotangent spaces , which ( again ) are spaces that are deeply and intimately linked to the manifold itself .",
    "the second type of field are fields that `` live '' in fibre bundles .",
    "these are fields that do nt necessarily carry any spacetime indices and therefore ca nt be expressed as tensors with spacetime indices .",
    "these are fields that do nt arise as a result of any natural structure on the base manifold - they must be put `` on top of '' the manifold .",
    "we already discussed this distinction a bit in sections [ sec : theequivalenceprinciple ] and page of section [ sec : gravitycoupledtoscalarfields ] .",
    "the content of the equivalence principle can be stated more mathematically by simply saying that gravity is entirely a result of things relating to the first type of field . on the other hand , as we mentioned in section [ sec : theequivalenceprinciple ]",
    ", there is no equivalence principle for the other forces , like electromagnetism .",
    "this can be stated more mathematically by simply saying that the other forces ( like electromagnetism ) are the result of things relating to the second type of fields .    as usual",
    ", we are skimming the peaks of mountains here .",
    "there is much , much more we can say about all of this , and indeed much more that we will say .",
    "the notion of fibre bundles over manifolds and the types of structures that can be built out of and on the resulting total spaces provides one of the richest and most profound areas in all of mathematics and physics , as well as providing a way of revealing deep relationships between gauge theories and general relativity and between geometry and topology .",
    "and so it is here that we conclude these notes .",
    "we have outlined the geometrical and topological ideas necessary to make sense ( at least at an introductory level ) of general relativity and several aspects of electromagnetic theory . and ,",
    "by applying the mathematical ideas to the physical situations we have , we have gained a shadowy glimpse into much fuller and richer structure of fundamental physical theories .",
    "the next paper in this series will begin to sharpen this glimpse , and by its end we should have a much more solid grasp of the profound relationship between physics and mathematics ."
