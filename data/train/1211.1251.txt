    "partition functions are the most fundamental quantities in both quantum systems and statistical systems .",
    "although it typically serves only the role of normalization in the physical interpretation , it encodes important thermodynamic information such as the free energy . in field theories , the partition function , in general , contains the information of not only perturbation but also instanton effects as well as some global analytical structures .",
    "therefore it is natural to study it as a first step .",
    "m - theory is supposed to unify all our understandings of non - perturbative effects in the string theory . in the seminal paper @xcite , the low - energy effective theory on @xmath3 multiple m2-branes on the geometry @xmath4 was proposed to be the @xmath5 supersymmetric chern - simons theory with gauge group @xmath6 and bifundamental matters @xmath7 forming the superpotential @xmath8 .",
    "it was found in @xcite that the infinite - dimensional path integral of the partition function on @xmath9 and the expectation values of bps wilson loops are reduced to a finite dimensional matrix model by the localization techniques @xcite .",
    "there is much progress in this matrix model including the derivation of the degree of freedom @xmath10 @xcite expected from the ads / cft correspondence @xcite and its perturbative completion by the airy function @xcite .",
    "recently , the abjm partition function was rewritten as that of a fermi gas system @xcite , where the standard method in statistical mechanics is applicable and the above properties are reproduced easily .",
    "the airy function and the fermi gas formalism imply a deep structure of m - theory .",
    "the airy function has the integral representation of the exponentiated cubic term , which looks similar to the partition function of the chern - simons theory , and appears also in other contexts of m - theory @xcite .",
    "therefore we would like to study the partition function further and to extract some physical information out of it .    in our previous work @xcite ,",
    "we have proposed a method to compute the exact partition function @xmath11 at @xmath12 and indeed computed it up to @xmath13 . here with a generalization of our method and a technique from @xcite , we perform the computation of the exact partition function at @xmath14 up to @xmath15 respectively .    after the computation of the exact values ,",
    "we proceed to study the non - perturbative effects .",
    "we can extract the non - perturbative corrections from the exact values of the partition function by subtracting the perturbative result .",
    "the main motivation of this paper is to explore an analytic form of the non - perturbative correction .",
    "it is known that there are two kinds of instantons that induce the non - perturbative corrections to the abjm partition function .",
    "one is called the worldsheet instanton , and the other the d2-instanton ( membrane instanton ) . from the viewpoint of the gravity",
    "dual , the type iia string theory on @xmath16 , the worldsheet instanton comes from the fundamental string wrapping the holomorphic cycle @xmath17 @xcite , while the d2-instanton comes from the d2-brane wrapping the lagrangian submanifold @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the worldsheet instanton behaves as @xmath19 while the d2-instanton as @xmath20 in the large @xmath3 limit .",

    ", we can know the expected forms of the instanton corrections to the partition function . in the fermi gas formalism , it is useful to consider the grand partition function .",
    "the grand potential ( the logarithm of the grand partition function ) , in general , receives the non - perturbative corrections as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the chemical potential , and @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the perturbative , d2-instanton and worldsheet instanton contributions , respectively .",
    "we note that the dots in represent an additional oscillatory contribution and , if any , bound states of the worldsheet instanton and d2-instanton . the oscillatory behavior will be studied in subsection [ sec : osc ] in detail , which we ignore here .",
    "the d2-instanton and the worldsheet instanton corrections are expected to take the following forms : @xmath26e^{-2m\\mu},{\\nonumber \\\\}j_k^{\\rm ws}(\\mu)&=\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty j^{{\\rm ws}(n)}_k(\\mu ) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty d_k^{(n)}e^{-\\frac{4n\\mu}{k}}. \\label{eq : jws}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we would like to determine the prefactors of those instanton corrections .",
    "the prefactors of the worldsheet instanton corrections are determined by the results of the topological string on local @xmath27 , where the first few prefactors are @xmath28 on the other hand , there are no systematic ways to determine the prefactors of the d2-instanton corrections . )",
    "expansions of the prefactors as in @xcite .",
    "however , it is hard to determine the higher order corrections in this way . ] in this paper , we propose the analytic form of the leading d2-instanton correction , @xmath29\\cos\\(\\frac{\\pi k}{2}\\ ) .",

    "let us briefly review the method found in @xcite .",

    "using these methods we computed the partition functions at @xmath0 .",
    "the exact values are given in appendix b. as can be imagined from @xcite , the partition functions have close relations with @xmath77 .",
    "therefore it is especially clean for these values of @xmath30 .",
    "as summarized in appendix [ sec : exactvalue ] , we obtain the exact values of the partition functions at @xmath0 up to @xmath78 , respectively , following the procedure in section [ sec : exactz ] . after computing the exact partition function ,",
    "let us extract important information from it . here",
    "we numerically study the non - perturbative corrections to the partition function . we shall plot various physical quantities computed by our exact values and fit them by the theoretically expected forms @xcite .",

    "we proposed an analytic expression of the d2 1-instanton correction which is consistent with all of the known properties so far .",

    "we have determined the analytic expression of the leading d2-instanton correction .",
    "we would like to study this effect from the worldvolume theory of the euclidean d2-brane wrapping on @xmath118 .",
    "we expect that the prefactor of d2-instanton correction is coming from the 1-loop determinant of the fluctuation around the classical d2-brane action . to analyze such effects , the recent result of reproducing the 1-loop log term from the gravitational computation in @xcite might be a helpful guide .",
    "although the worldsheet instanton coefficients @xmath119 obtained from the topological string correctly reproduce the t hooft limit of free energy studied in @xcite , we find some discrepancy between the prediction of @xmath119 and our results obtained by the numerical analysis .",
    "for example , let us take a closer look at the @xmath120 cases in .",

    "we believe that the predictions of worldsheet instanton corrections from the topological string and are correct at generic @xmath30 , and we conjecture that the reason of this discrepancy is due to a kind of bound states of the d2-instanton and the worldsheet instanton .",
