    "from what we know about the single bunch longitudinal and transverse instabilities @xcite@xcite , it is clear to see that the information about the bunch lengthening , @xmath0 , with respect to the bunch current is the _ key _ to open the locked chain of bunch lengthening , energy spread increasing and the fast transverse instability threshold current . in this paper",
    "an improved ( compared with what we have proposed in ref .",
    "3 ) empirical bunch lengthening equation is proposed as follows : @xmath1 where @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5 is the single particle `` bunch length '' , @xmath6 is the bunch total longitudinal loss factor for one turn at @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the resistive and inductive part of the machine impedance , respectively , @xmath10 is the inductance of the ring for one turn , @xmath11 is the permittivity in vacuum , @xmath12 is planck constant , @xmath13 is the velocity of light , @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the particle number inside the bunch , and @xmath16 is the average radius of the ring . obviously , if @xmath17 one has @xmath18 , which is the case for the most existing storage rings . if spear scaling law @xcite is used ( for example ) , @xmath19 ( in fact each machine has its own @xmath20 ) , eq .",
    "[ eq : gj11 ] can be written as @xmath21 in fact , the third term of eqs .",
    "[ eq : gj11 ] is due to the _ collective random excitation _ effect revealed in ref . 1 , except a new factor @xmath22 which is introduced in this paper to include the special case where @xmath9 has the same order of magnitude or even less than @xmath8 .",
    "the second term , however , is obtained intuitively as explained in section 3 .",
    "now we make more discussions on @xmath9 and @xmath8 .",
    "being aware of the possible ambiguity coming from this frequently used term in the domain of collective instabilities in storage rings , we define @xmath8 and @xmath9 used in this paper as follows : @xmath23 and @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is the particle revolution period . by using eqs .",
    "[ eq : gj12cc ] and [ eq : gj12dd ] one gets explicit expression of @xmath22 shown in eq . [ eq : gj9a ] .",
    "the procedure to get the information about the bunch lengthening and the energy spread increasing is firstly to find @xmath29 by solving bunch lengthening equation , i.e. , eq .",
    "[ eq : gj11 ] , and then calculate energy spread increasing , @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) , by putting @xmath29 into eq .",
    "[ eq : gj12a ] @xcite : @xmath32 once @xmath30 is found , one can use the following formula to calculate the fast single bunch transverse instability threshold current @xcite : @xmath33 with @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are synchrotron and vertical betatron oscillation tunes , respectively , @xmath37 is the average beta function in the rf cavity region , @xmath38 is the chromaticity in the vertical plane ( usually positive to control the head - tail instability ) , @xmath39 is the total transverse loss factor over one turn , @xmath40 is the natural energy spread , and @xmath41 is the particle energy . in practice , it is useful to express @xmath39 as @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the value at the natural bunch length , and @xmath44 is a constant depending on the machine concerned . as a super - aco scaling law ,",
    "@xmath44 can be taken as @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "[ eq:30a ] is therefore expressed as : @xmath46 the notation @xmath47 is used with the aim of distinguishing it from the formula given by zotter @xcite@xcite .",
    "in this section we look at seven machines with their parameters shown in table [ tab:1 ] .",
    "+    .the machine parameters . [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     concerning the loss factors , that of infn accumulator ring comes from ref . 6 and",
    "the others are obtained by fitting the corresponding experimental results with the bunch lengthening equation given in ref .",
    "1 . figs . 1 to 10",
    "show the comparison results between the analytical and the experimental @xcite-@xcite bunch lengthening values , and fig .",
    "11 shows the single bunch energy spread increasing .",
    "it is obvious that this improved empirical bunch lengthening equation is quite powerful . among the seven different storage rings ,",
    "slc new damping ring is the unique and the most interesting one since it is a very resistive ring @xcite , on the contrary , the other rings including slc old damping ring are quite inductive .",
    "the inductances of the old and the new slc damping rings are 33 nh and 6 nh , respectively @xcite . by fitting the bunch lengthening experimental results",
    ", one finds that the loss factor @xmath6 equals 12 v / pc at @xmath48 cm ( this value is put in table 2 ) , which agrees quite well with the experimentally measured loss factor , 15 v / pc , at the same bunch length @xcite . from fig .",
    "11 one can see that the single bunch energy spread increasing in slc new damping ring is rather accurately predicted by eq .",
    "[ eq : gj12a ] .",
    "in fact eq . [ eq : gj11 ] can be obtained from the following equation by truncating the taylor expansion of the right hand side of eq . [",
    "eq : gj72 ] up to the second order .",
    "@xmath49 from the point of view of aesthetics , eq . [ eq : gj72 ] is more attractive ( at least for the author ) . even if it does nt work well itself , this equation is instructive for us to establish the second term in eq .",
    "[ eq : gj11 ] .",
    "in this paper we propose an improved empirical bunch lengthening equation and compare the analytical results with the experimental results of seven different machines where slc new damping ring is quite resistive .",
    "the agreement between the analytical and experimental results is quite satisfactory .",
    "the factor @xmath22 introduced in this paper should be included ( one should multiply it to @xmath6 ) into the corresponding formulae in ref . 1 also in order to be applied to the case where a storage ring is very resistive .",
    "the author thanks j. le duff and j. hassinski for their critical comments and interests in this subject .",
