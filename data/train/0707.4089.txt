    "the neutrino oscillation phenomenon is well established . in several different experiments , the transition between different neutrino flavours",
    "is observed @xcite .",
    "there is agreement that oscillation is possible when different mass neutrino states add coherently @xcite in their production process .",
    "such a combination of eigenmass neutrino states was defined many years ago by maki , nakagawa and sakata @xcite using the previous idea of neutrino mixing invented by pontecorvo@xcite .",
    "now , there is agreement concerning the definition of so - called neutrino flavour states for relativistic neutrinos .",
    "the state of three massive relativistic neutrinos produced in the process involving a charged flavour @xmath0 lepton is given by @xcite @xmath1 lepton with a massive @xmath2 neutrino and w boson is given by : @xmath3 such an interaction produces a relativistic neutrino with negative helicity ( antineutrino with positive helicity ) , and its propagation in a vacuum or in matter does not reverse spin direction ( neutral current interaction is also left - handed ) . in such circumstances , it is natural to describe neutrinos by a pure quantum mechanical state eq.([mnsp ] ) . so far ,",
    "only relativistic neutrinos are detected ( the detection energy threshold is practically larger then 100 kev @xcite ) , and the pure production state eq.([mnsp ] ) works well .",
    "however , there are several reasons to pose the following question about general neutrino states : what is the neutrino state if it is not necessarily relativistic , and/or its interaction is more general than that given by eq.([elementary coupling ] ) ?",
    "the answer for such a question is important as attempts are ongoing to define different neutrino states in a non - relativistic region ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "besides , there is a chance that future more precise neutrino oscillation experiments will open a window for new physics ( np ) and the knowledge of the initial and final neutrino states could be important .",
    "the attempts to define general neutrino states have been discussed many times in the literature ( see e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "the neutrino production and detection states that depend on the specific physical process were considered in e.g. @xcite . to our knowledge , the most general oscillation and detection neutrino states were studied by giunti @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . however , even in this work , only pure states in the relativistic case , without the spin effect of particles which produces neutrinos , are finally discussed .    the aim of our study is to construct a general neutrino density matrix using the helicity - mass basis using the amplitude for the production process in the cm system or rest system of a decaying object ( e.g. muon in the neutrino factory or nucleus in the beta beam experiments ) using a full wave packet description of particles . in order to find how physics beyond the sm modify neutrino production states , we consider the general neutrino interaction .",
    "next , we transform the density matrix to the frame of the detector - the laboratory frame .",
    "such a general lorentz transformation causes wigner rotation for spin states @xcite .",
    "we show that , even if such a wigner rotation can be large , its effect on neutrino helicity states is small and without practical meaning",
    ". then we have the general density matrix describing a neutrino beam , which oscillates as it passes between the production site and the detector . in this way",
    ", we will be able , although it is not subject of this paper , to consider more precisely any possible influence of np not only on oscillation phenomena as usual ( @xcite ) , but also on the production and , in a similar way , detection of neutrino .",
    "in such a case , all quantum mechanical properties of neutrino oscillation phenomena ( such as the problem of factorization , oscillation and coherence length ) could be considered in the more precise way .",
    "we ask questions about when the neutrino state is pure and when it must be consider as mixed , how this property depends on neutrino energy , and the mechanism of the production process .",
    "we show that , for non - relativistic neutrinos , their state is always mixed .",
    "this is a very natural result , for neutrinos with an energy comparable to their masses , even a left - handed interaction ( eq.([elementary coupling ] ) ) produces neutrinos with both helicities .",
    "such a case must be described by a mixed state .",
    "but , as we will see , the appearance of the subdominant neutrino helicity states is not the only reason for the mixture of states .",
    "if the np introduces different mixing matrices for different kinds of interactions ( for vector and scalar couplings , as examples ) , quantum mixing of states also appears . because of that , any attempt to treat a flavour neutrino as one object in fock space ( see e.g. @xcite ) , even if mathematically consistent , creates a problem with the description of the real production process .",
    "neutrino states are always mixed if the production mechanism is more complicated in comparison with the sm left - handed interaction eq.([elementary coupling ] ) .",
    "the neutrino density matrix also depends on the other properties of the production process ; for example , the scattering angle , polarizations of other accompanying particles , and their momentum uncertainties as well as on the neutrinos themselves , the mass of the lightest neutrino , or their mass hierarchy .    in this paper , we discuss only the first stage of the oscillation process - the preparation of neutrino states - leaving the problem of oscillation , together with the interaction inside the medium and the problem of their detection , for a future paper . in the next chapter",
    ", we describe the neutrino density matrix for the selected production process . as the base process , we take the neutrino production where charged flavour leptons @xmath4 scatter on nuclei a ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "amplitudes are calculated for the general interaction and the normalized ( @xmath6 ) density matrix in the cm system is found .",
    "then , the problem of the lorentz transformation and wigner rotation is discussed .",
    "the full analytical and numerical properties of the neutrino density matrix are analyzed . to distinguish between mixed and pure states ,",
    "we calculate @xmath7 as a function of neutrino energy and the parameters which describe the sm extensions .",
    "we also discuss how fast the neutrino states become pure as the energy increases .",
    "we study density matrices for two subsystems : the first which describes both neutrinos helicity independent of their mass , and the second describing the mixture of three neutrinos , independent of their spin state .",
    "finally , chapter 3 gives our final comments and future prospectives .",
    "let us assume that the beam of neutrinos with mass i , @xmath2 is produced by charged leptons @xmath8 which scatter on nuclei a. @xmath9 we do not measure separate neutrinos and their masses ; in fact , we do not directly measure neutrinos at all .",
    "quantum neutrino states can be deduced from the measured states of all other particles accompanying the neutrino .",
    "so , having information about particles a , b and , especially , about charged lepton @xmath10 in the process eq.([1 ] ) , gives us the ability to define neutrino states . to define the spatial or momentum distribution for neutrinos",
    ", we have to assume that all particles in the discussed process do not have a precisely determined momentum , so they must be defined by wave packets and not by plane waves ( as is usually the case in other scattering processes ) . in order to discuss coherence effects in the detection process",
    ", we have to define the momentum distribution of the mass - helicity density matrix .",
    "such a density matrix can be constructed from the amplitude for the process ( [ 1 ] ) whose interaction mechanism is under investigation .",
    "we assume that our interaction is described by an effective model lagrangian where both the vector and scalar couplings with the left and right chirality interaction are present .",
    "this sort of interaction appears , for example , in the left - right symmetric model ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "we see that the determination of the flavour neutrino state given by the pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata matrix is purely accidental and valid only in the sm and relativistic neutrino interaction . in such circumstances , we can not consider flavour neutrinos as elementary quanta of a field theory .",
