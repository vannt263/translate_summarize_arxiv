    "observations of the ly@xmath0 forest provide a very sensitive way for observing of the cosmic matter distribution and the early stages of galaxy formation : this is because the _ linear density regime _ of gravitational collapse near turnaround for galactic scales ( several hundred kpc at z@xmath3 ) coincides roughly with the _ linear part of the curve of growth _ for the lyman @xmath0 absorption line , as shown in fig .",

    "the hydro - simulations picture a ly@xmath0 forest caused by a coherent network of filaments , sheets , and knots of gas , in which more spherical , higher density condensations , galaxies or mini - halos , are embedded .",
    "the fraction of baryons in lyman @xmath0 clouds in cdm based models is indeed very high @xcite , with ( even by z @xmath4 2 ) of order 80% of all baryons in low column density clouds , dominated by the range ( 14 @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath5 15.5 ) @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the spatial arrangement of this baryonic reservoir is illustrated by fig .",
    "[ densdist ] .",
    "column density contours at a level as high as @xmath7 @xmath8 are stretching continuously over many hundreds of kpcs .",
    "_ most of the baryons are concentrated in the filaments _ , without having collapsed into lyman limit systems , virialized galaxies or damped ly@xmath0 systems yet .",
    "the hydrodynamic simulations are illustrative and have furthered the interpretation of qso absorption spectra immensely , but they can also be used for quantitative measurements , e.g. , by comparing large sets of simulated qso spectra with observed ones .",
    "the problem is as usual to find observables which can be measured at a reasonable precision , do not depend sensitively on the shortcomings of the modelling and at the same time correspond in a unique way to the ingredients of the simulated model .",
    "one of the most easily measurable quantities is the distribution of pixel intensities @xmath9 = @xmath10 ( or alternatively , flux decrements @xmath11 , or optical depths @xmath12 ) , i.e. the amount of light per unit velocity absorbed by ly@xmath0 of intervening hi clouds from the beam of a qso .",
    "the optical depth @xmath12 is a measure of the distribution of the neutral hydrogen in real and velocity space , @xmath13 d@xmath14/d@xmath15 , where d@xmath14 is the neutral hydrogen column density spread out over velocity interval d@xmath15 .",
    "the simulations predict density @xmath16 , temperature @xmath17 , peculiar velocity @xmath18 , and thus the ionization state of the gas as a function of the cosmological model , with the ionizing radiation background , and the total @xmath19 in the universe as free parameters . in the density range",
    "producing most of the absorption the gas is highly ionized , and photoionization dominates the ionization equilibrium .",
    "then the optical depth for absorption is approximately proportional to    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the photoionization probability per second , @xmath22 the recombination coefficient , @xmath23 the hubble constant , @xmath16 the gas density , and @xmath24 the gradient of the peculiar velocity along the line of sight .",
    "then , for a given temperature , the optical depth scales with",
    "@xmath25 . if we are able to obtain an independent estimate of one of the parameters e.g. , the ionizing flux , we can determine the other , e.g. , @xmath26 or vice versa .",
    "we have observed a sample of 7 qsos with the keck telescope , and compared the observed distribution of flux decrements",
    "@xmath27 = @xmath28 with the predicted distribution from an eulerian hydro - simulation of a cdm+@xmath29 universe @xcite , and a standard cdm universe from an sph simulation @xcite .",
    "the measurement consists of applying a suitable global scaling to the simulated optical depths such that the mean flux decrements agree between simulation and observation for each of three redshift bins , @xmath30    observed and simulated cumulative flux decrement distributions are shown in fig .",
    "[ datsim ] .",
    "the continuum level is at @xmath27 = 0 , the zero level ( no transmitted light ) at @xmath27 = 1 .",
    "one remarkable feature is the rapid decrease of the mean absorption with decreasing redshift . in the hierarchical models this is mostly due to the expansion of the universe which decreases the gas density and the neutral fraction .",
    "excellent agreement with the observed distribution is attained for both models , after scaling the optical depth globally .",
    "it is worth pondering that this is the result of a one - parameter fit which is equivalent to adjusting the area under the curve giving the cumulative distribution .",
    "the agreement between the shapes of the distribution is an independent bit of information , telling us that these models do indeed produce a ly@xmath0 forest with a realistic intensity distribution .",
    "the eulerian @xmath29cdm model is doing slightly better than the sph scdm simulation , in that the latter has more absorption at low column densities , leading to a steeper slope than observed .",
    "this may reflect differences in the way the heating during reionization was incorporated .",
    "having obtained the scalefactors for the optical depths in the simulations we can derive a lower limit on @xmath31 .",
    "for an independent estimate of the radiation background intensity we adopt a temporally constant uv background with @xmath32 s@xmath33 .",
    "this value corresponds to @xmath34 ( depending on the spectral shape ) .",
    "it is a _ lower limit _ in that it includes only the radiation background from known qsos alone . from the firm lower limit on @xmath21 due to qsos alone",
    "we can determine a lower limit for the amount of baryons in the universe :    @xmath35 @xmath2 0.017    our measurement ( described in more detail in @xcite ) supports a high @xmath36 ( low d / h ) universe , still consistent with the upper range permitted by the solar system light element abundances @xcite and with the @xmath36 derived from the d / h measurements by tytler et al .",
    "( these proceedings ) .",
    "remaining uncertainties stem from the assumed intensity of the ionizing radiation background , and the temperature the lower column density gas has attained by the time reionization is complete . moreover , the data sample is still relatively small , especially at lower redshifts .",
    "the validity of these results depends of course not only the correct cosmological model , but also on its technical realisation : how can we be sure that we are not missing structure on very small scales , which are not resolved by the simulations ? if there were clumpiness on sub - kpc scales ( unresolved by current techniques ) , the gas could be locally more neutral and a smaller amount of baryons could conceivably account for the same amount of opacity in the lyman @xmath0 forest .",
    "from some point on such structure will diverge from the properties of the cdm based cosmological models @xcite but the only way to find out for sure whether it exists is to search directly for clumpiness in the gas responsible for most of the ly@xmath0 forest absorption .",
    "the presence or absence of density and velocity structure on very small scales at high z can best be tested for by searching for differences between the absorption systems in adjacent lines of sight to multiple ( lensed ) qso images .",
    "we have embarked on a project to ( re-)observe high redshift lensed qsos with the keck hires spectrograph , among them the two cases um 673 and he 1104 - 1805 , studied in the important papers by smette et al .",
    "the difference to earlier work is that with keck we are able to resolve the line widths even of most metal absorption systems , and can measure the column densities directly .",
    "the column density differences over a known separation in the plane of the sky can be translated into gradients in the baryon density .",
    "we have completely profile - fitted a lyman @xmath0 forest region around z= 2.6 in both the @xmath37 and @xmath38 images of the qso um673 and measured the column differences among those voigt profile components agreeing in velocity position to within 10 kms@xmath33 .",
    "we restricted the analysis to hi column densities between @xmath39 and @xmath7 @xmath8 , a range contributing most prominently to the opacity at redshifts 2.6 .",
    "this way we should be able to answer our question whether there is structure in the gas producing the ly@xmath0 forest which may be capable of upsetting the @xmath31 results .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that the hi column density n(hi ) should depend on the baryon density as @xmath40 with @xmath41 1.6 . for the rms scatter of the logarithmic baryon density gradient",
    "we then obtain @xmath42 the inequality arises because the variable thickness of the clouds introduces an additional scatter in the column densities , even for a density field constant everywhere . retaining only those line pairs with a measurement error of less than 0.2 in the logarithmic column density differences we arrive at an upper limit to the rms estimate for fluctuations in the logarithmic overdensity , @xmath43 valid for a sample with a mean transverse separation of 0.16 h@xmath44 kpc between the lines of sight ( for @xmath45=0.5 ) .",
    "other choices of sample size give similar values .",
    "obviously , those parts of the universe contributing most to the ly@xmath0 forest opacity do not show detectable clumpiness , at least on the scale we have now searched .",
    "future investigations of lenses with somewhat wider image separation and/or wavelength coverage further to the blue will eventually provide information on the kpc range .",
    "moving to higher column densities the lines of sight ultimately must be sampling the gaseous extent of high redshift galaxies .",
    "the presence of these can be inferred from the striking variations between metal absorption lines in the different images , which stand out quite dramatically from the quiescent lower column density ly@xmath0 forest .",
    "column densities even in the high ionization civ gas can fluctuate by a factor two over a few hundred parsecs ( fig .",
    "[ civspec ] ) .",
    "apparently , we are seeing variations in the ionization parameter of the early interstellar medium .",
    "these variations can be used to establish the sizes ( more correctly the coherence lengths ) for the gas units in those galaxies , and the internal velocity dispersion .",
    "[ civvnstat1 ] shows for the first time , how the decoherence in the properties of these civ absorption systems takes place in individual lines of sight as a function of beam separation . in this figure",
    "each civ complex ( i.e. , the full absorption system ) is shown by a large circle .",
    "`` subclumps '' , i.e. , groups of lines , between which the continuum recovers , have been assigned by eye somewhat subjectively , and are denoted by small circles .",
    "individual absorption components , as far as their fate can be traced across the lines of sight , are represented by dots .",
    "the different classes of symbols are of course not statistically independent as the single components are parts of the subclumps etc .",
    "it is obvious from the lhs figure that variations in the column density of individual civ components have reached 50% at separations of a few hundred pc , while the total complexes differ at that level once separations between a few and 20 kpc are reached .",
    "velocity differences increase to about 60 km@xmath33 at separations of a few kpc ( rhs plot ) .",
    "as one goes to the very smallest separations the differences both in velocity and column density do not diminish as much as expected for a naive extrapolation to zero separation at the qso redshift itself .",
    "this may be indicating that the associated ( @xmath46 ) clouds are smaller than intervening systems , do not cover the qso continuum emission region , or possess some internal motion on very small scales .",
    "we can use the differences in column density as a function of separation to estimate , in a statistical sense , the size of the civ absorbing galaxies as a function of the column density detection threshold . making the very crude assumption that all these objects have identical sizes and densities , and approximating their column density  radius relation by a gaussian , we find a mean radius of 14 h@xmath44 kpc at the 3.7@xmath4710@xmath48@xmath8 ( @xmath4 15 m  equivalent width ) contour .",
    "we emphasize that this is a very crude estimate as it appears already from the few systems observed that there is a whole range of sizes .",
    "interestingly , this coherence length for high ionization gas ( at z@xmath49 23 ) is considerable smaller than than that for mgii ( low ionization ) systems at low redshifts and similar detection threshold ( @xmath4 180 h@xmath44 kpc for 0.5",
    "@xmath5 z @xmath5 1.3 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the increase in cross - section could be due to galaxy halos growing , or an increasing metal enrichment of the universe by volume , as time proceeds .",
