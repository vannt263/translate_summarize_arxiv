    "a motion of point vortices ( pvs ) is one of the simple and fundamental issues in fluid dynamics @xcite .",
    "there have been a number of numerical studies of pvs , whose motion is bounded by a circular wall .",
    "recently , stable triangular vortex lattices have been observed in rotating bose - einstein condensates of na atoms @xcite in which the circulation of vortices is quantized with the same strength and the lattice contains over 100 vortices .",
    "many experimental reports of superfluid vortex lattices increased in these several years show triangular patterns @xcite , which can be compared with the stability analysis of vortex lattices by tkachenko @xcite in 1966 .",
    "conformal theory of irrotational flows and complex functions are invoked and the role of the weierstrass zeta function is crucial .    this paper supplements the letter @xcite by showing the spatial distribution of pvs for various type of initial conditions .",
    "tkachenko s work 40 years ago and recent strong interests by physicists on vortex lattices in bose - einstein condensates stimulate the author to consider the numerical study of motions of pvs with periodic boundary conditions .    in order to quantify clustering of the point distribution ,",
    "we apply point process theory used in spatial ecology .",
    "the computed @xmath3 and @xmath2 functions judge the distribution to be clustered or not .",
    "this method can be applied to other systems which include information of the point distribution in two or more dimensions .",
    "the velocity field by a single periodic pv of strength @xmath4 is given by @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 and the overbar denotes the complex conjugate .",
    "the corresponding streamfunction is denoted by @xmath7 the weierstrass zeta and sigma functions ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) contain two complex parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 , which are half periods on the complex plane .",
    "the second term including @xmath12 $ ] expresses the solid rotation in order to cancel the circulation on sides of the parallelogram induced by the pv .    the equations of motions for pvs of strength @xmath13 , @xmath14 ,",
    "can be described by @xmath15 for a single type of pvs with the total number @xmath16 , the index @xmath17 is @xmath18 . for positive and negative pvs with the same strength ,",
    "the index is @xmath19 .",
    "there are three known conserved quantities ; the hamiltonian and two components of the linear impulse @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3 function used in spatial ecology @xcite is defined by @xmath20 where @xmath16 is the total number of points , @xmath21 is the number density , @xmath22 is the area , @xmath23 is the position of the @xmath24th points , and @xmath25 is the step function .",
    "a function for the edge correction on the right hand side of ( [ eq4 ] ) , which usually appears in data analysis of spatial ecology , is unnecessary in the present periodic case .",
    "the @xmath2 function is given by @xmath26 if the distribution of points is complete spatial randomness ( csr ) , then @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "if the points are clustered , @xmath29 .",
    "the uniformly spaced ( us ) distribution leads to @xmath30 .",
    "it is generally difficult to distinguish between csr and us distributions only if we see raw data of the point distribution .",
    "however , the @xmath2 function gives judgment on the degree of clustering clearly .",
    "we note that the value of @xmath31 depends on @xmath32 . for examples ,",
    "the checkered pattern gives a positive value of @xmath31 for @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the size of the smallest square , but @xmath35 for @xmath36 .",
    "the system ( [ eq3 ] ) with @xmath16 up to 100 is simulated numerically by using _",
    "mathematica _ 5.2 . the textbook by trott ( 2006 ) @xcite gives a number of numerical codes for _ mathematica _ programming , including samples of point vortices with other boundary conditions .",
    "we first consider the following four initial conditions : ( i ) an infinite row that is a discrete model of the vortex sheet , ( ii ) pvs located randomly in checkered patterns , ( iii ) pvs located randomly in the 10 @xmath37 10 subsquares , and ( iv ) csr in the unit square .",
    "the typical initial and final distributions of pvs are shown in figures 1 - 4 .",
    "the corresponding @xmath2 functions can be found in @xcite .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "clustering of pvs is studied numerically based on point process theory and the @xmath2 functions are computed from the final distributions of pvs . clustering persists up to 10 eddy turnover time .",
    "we also did a numerical simulation for slightly perturbed square vortex lattices , which can be regarded as a special circumstance of case ( iii ) .",
    "it showed inactive motions of pvs compared with the other examples shown in this paper .",
    "it may imply that the instability of square lattices requires more than 100 pvs , or the rate of growth is very small .",
    "the author is grateful for professor t. yamagata for support through his research on fluid dynamics over these several years ."
