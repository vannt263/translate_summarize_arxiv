    "the existence and uniqueness of a time - invariant measure for the navier - stokes equations has been the subject of much recent research .",
    "a major advance was achieved in @xcite where it was shown that , under a random bounded kick - type force , the navier - stokes system on the torus ( bounded domains with smooth boundaries and periodic boundary conditions ) has a unique time - invariant measure .",
    "subsequently , the argument was refined to a more flexible coupling approach in @xcite , which paved the way for extending the argument to the case of a white - noise random force ( @xcite , @xcite , or @xcite ) . except for the white - noise case , these methods focused on the case of zero deterministic forcing on the system and the equations on the torus .",
    "of course , for meteorological purposes , it is desirable to consider the equations on the sphere and to require the deterministic force to be nonzero .",
    "this was done in @xcite , where a time - invariant measure for the navier - stokes equations on the sphere was shown to exist both under a random bounded kick - type force with a time - independent deterministic force and under a white - noise force .    in this paper",
    "the work in @xcite is extended to include time - periodic deterministic forces .",
    "a similar result was established in @xcite for the torus and with a random perturbation activated by an indicator function .",
    "we instead use a random perturbation activated by a dirac function and include the more general case of a squeezing - type property . even though the random force in @xcite is more general in the sense of time - dependence , we use the random kick - force as in @xcite and @xcite to allow less regularity assumptions and to highlight the similarities between the time - independent and time - periodic cases .",
    "the first section uses a combination of the approaches in @xcite , @xcite @xcite , and @xcite to define each of the terms in the navier - stokes equations on the sphere .",
    "of utmost importance are the eigenvalues of the laplacian term which allow the analysis to proceed as in the case of flat domains .",
    "in addition , we consider the navier - stokes equations under time - periodic forcing , establishing conditions for there to be a limiting solution that is periodic , including several cases where the period of the unique solution is the same as the force .",
    "the second section presents the main theorem , which establishes the existence and uniqueness of an invariant measure for the kicked equations with a time - periodic deterministic external force .",
    "the proof of the main theorem is done by proving that necessary conditions hold for the applicability of theorem 3.2.5 in @xcite . as will be seen",
    ", the periodicity of the deterministic force allows the argument for stationary forces to be applied to the time - periodic case .",
    "the necessary conditions for the main theorem are shown for several cases including a contraction - type property and a squeezing - type property with ",
    "large \" random kicks . the main idea behind",
    "the contraction - type property is the exponential stability of solutions , i.e. , the contraction of the flow to a unique solution , while the squeezing - type property is related to the idea of determining modes ( @xcite , p. 363 ) . more precisely ,",
    "if the projection of the initial conditions onto the first @xmath0 eigenfunctions is close enough then the solutions will converge .",
    "the third section recalls work done in @xcite describing the support of the measure .",
    "the support is described both in general and specifically for several examples . by combining results in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the support of the measure is also described in terms of a unique time - periodic solution in several cases , including some of potential meteorological interest .",
