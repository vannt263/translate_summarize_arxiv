    "furthermore , soft gluon resummation effects will also be important for the production cross section at low @xmath101 .    the cuts in eq .",

    "figure  7 shows the @xmath16 and @xmath141 distributions with the stronger and more realistic cuts @xmath155 for the same three @xmath101 bins as in fig .",
    "the curves are now very different from the curves in fig .  5 and no traces of polarization effects",
    "are left in fig .",
    "we have also analyzed the effect of the cuts by using the correct matrix element for @xmath14 production , but with isotropic decay of the virtual photon , _",

    "the kinematical effects in the two low @xmath101 bins are very large and the cuts remove all events around @xmath157 as well as for large @xmath141 values [ see fig .  7 ] ,",

    "thus even in the presence of large acceptance cuts it may be possible to highlight the polarization effects in the experimental results by dividing the experimental distributions by the corresponding monte carlo distributions obtained using isotropic @xmath14 decay .",
    "the polar and azimuthal angular distributions of the lepton pair arising from the decay of a virtual photon produced at high transverse momentum in hadronic collisions have been discussed . in the absence of cuts on the final state leptons , the general structure of the lepton angular distribution in the virtual photon rest frame",
    "is determined by the polarization of the virtual photon . in perturbative qcd , the structure",
    "is described by four helicity cross sections , which are functions of the transverse momentum and rapidity of the virtual photon .",
    "we have calculated to @xmath1 the angular coefficients which govern the lepton angular distributions and find that the corrections are relatively small in both the cs and gj frames , especially in the cs frame .",
    "this is because the angular coefficients @xmath17 are ratios of helicity cross sections and the large qcd corrections in the individual helicity cross sections tend to cancel in the ratios .",
    "we have also studied the angular distributions of the leptonic decay products of a high @xmath9 virtual photon when acceptance cuts and energy resolution smearing are applied to the leptons . when acceptance cuts are imposed on the leptons , the shapes of the lepton angular distributions",
    "are dominated by kinematic effects and the residual dynamical effects from the virtual photon polarization are small .",
    "the kinematic effects become more dominate as the cuts become more stringent and as the invariant mass of the photon decreases .",
    "energy resolution smearing has a negligible effect on the angular distributions .",
    "polarization effects can be maximized by minimizing the cuts on the decay leptons , however , this strategy is severly limited since cuts are needed due to the finite acceptance of a detector .",
    "polarization effects are also more pronounced when the virtual photon is in the central rapidity region .",
    "alternatively , it may be possible to highlight virtual photon polarization effects by `` dividing out '' the kinematic effects , _",
