    "markov chains or random walks on graphs have proved to be a fundamental tool , with broad applications in various fields of mathematics , computer science and the natural sciences , such as mathematical modeling of physical systems , simulated annealing , and the markov chain monte carlo method . in the physical sciences they provide a fundamental model for the emergence of global properties from local interactions . in the algorithmic context , they provide a general paradigm for sampling and exploring an exponentially large set of combinatorial structures ( such as matchings in a graph ) , by using a sequence of simple , local transitions .    in this paper , we initiate a study of the theory of quantum walks on graphs  the motivation , as in the case of markov chains , is to study global properties of a certain structured set , using repeated application of local transition rules . in the quantum setting , though , the local transition rule is defined to be unitary , rather than probabilistic .",
    "a classical markov chain is said to be a random walk on an underlying graph , if the nodes of the graph are the states in @xmath0 , and a state @xmath1 has non zero probability to go to @xmath2 if and only if the edge @xmath3 exists in the graph . to define a quantum random walk , in addition to the hilbert space spanned by the nodes of the graph",
    ", we must explicitly introduce the hilbert space spanned by the outcomes of the coin that control the process .",
    "thus , the quantum walk is allowed to use an auxiliary hilbert space .",
    "now , the quantum walk on a graph is naturally defined to be a unitary transformation on the tensor product of the hilbert space of the graph and the auxiliary hilbert space , and with the property that the probability amplitude ( rather than the probability ) is non zero only on edges of the graph .    how do the basic definitions of markov chains carry over to quantum walks ?",
    "the most fundamental property of markov chains is the fact that they converge to a stationary distribution , independent of the initial state .",
    "however , by their very definition , quantum walks do not converge to any stationary state .",
    "this is due to the fact that unitary matrices preserve the norm of vectors , and hence the distance between the vectors describing the system at subsequent times does not converge to @xmath4 .",
    "one can ask whether the probability distribution induced on the nodes of the graph converges in time , but it turns out that it does not converge either . yet we can obtain a natural notion of convergence in the quantum case , if we define the limiting distribution as the limit of the _ average _ of the probability distributions over time .",
    "this definition captures the amount of time the walk spends in each subset of the nodes , and moreover , it corresponds to the natural concept of sampling from the graph , since if one measures the state at a random time chosen from the interval @xmath5 , the resulting distribution is exactly the average distribution .",
    "we show that although in general , the limiting distribution is a function of the initial state of the quantum walk , for cayley graphs of abelian groups it is independent of the initial state , and is uniform over the group elements .",
    "the rate of convergence , called the mixing time , is of crucial importance to algorithmic applications of classical markov chains .",
    "given the notion of limiting distribution in the quantum case , we can now talk about mixing times of a quantum walk .",
    "a natural definition for mixing time is the time it takes for the average probability distribution to get close to the limiting distribution .",
    "we can also talk about measures for how fast the quantum walk spreads or how long it takes the quantum walk to escape from a small neighborhood .",
    "we give definitions of quantum mixing time , sampling time , filling time , and dispersion time .",
    "how do the various mixing times of quantum walks compare with their classical counterparts ?",
    "we show that the quantum walk on a cycle converges in time @xmath6 , giving a nearly quadratic speedup over the classical walk . for the cycle",
    "this quadratic speed up is the best possible , since the diameter of the graph is clearly a lower bound for the mixing time . how large can the quantum speed up be , for other graphs ?",
    "we give a general lower bound on the various measures for the quantum mixing time , in terms of the conductance of the underlying graph .",
    "our main result is that quantum random walks on graphs can be at most polynomially faster than their classical counterparts , and in fact , for bounded degree graphs , the gap is at most quadratic .",
    "it is still an open question whether quantum walks can be used to obtain a quadratic speed up for certain randomized algorithms  such as 2-sat .",
    "indeed , all quantum algorithms from the last decade  including shor s celebrated factorization algorithm@xcite and grover s search algorithm@xcite  use only quantum fourier transforms and classical computation .",
    "is it possible to use other types of unitary transformations to design new quantum algorithms ?",
    "one constraint that must be met is that the unitary transformations must be poly - local  they must be a product of a polynomial number of local unitary transformations .",
    "quantum walks on graphs might provide a good starting point to explore the effects of a sequence of local unitary transformations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first give some background regarding classical markov chains and the quantum model .",
    "we proceed to define quantum markov chains , and prove various general results about the limiting distribution .",
    "we then prove the speed up for the quantum walk on the cycle , which is followed by an upper bound on the mixing time for general graphs .",
    "finally we prove the polynomial lower bound on the speed up for any graph , and conclude with a list of open questions .",
    "* related work : * various researchers studied special cases of quantum walks on graphs .",
    "feynman studied quantum walks on a line ; farhi and gutmann@xcite and childs , farhi and gutmann@xcite studied quantum walks on various graphs and gave examples of graphs on which the quantum walk hits a particular node exponentially faster than a classical walk .",
    "( note that this is a different task from the convergence to the stationary distribution , which we consider in this paper . )",
    "ambainis , bach , nayak , vishvanath and watrous@xcite studied various properties of the discrete - time quantum walk on the line .",
    "in particular , they have calculated the the asymptotic behavior of the probability distributions for the walk on the infinite line , and shown that the probability distribution at time @xmath2 is within a constant in total variation distance from the uniform distribution over an interval which is of length linear in @xmath2 .",

    "i.e. if all nodes have the same degree , the limiting probability distribution is uniform over the nodes of the graph .",

    "this coincides with the    interpretation by which the set of basis states of the combined system    @xmath67 is spanned by all possible classical configurations    of the two classical systems @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",

    "we can write @xmath152 the latter term converges to zero , therefore the contribution to the limiting distribution comes solely from terms with @xmath145 .",

    "this yields the desired claim , using the fact that the probability to measure a node @xmath86 is a sum over the probabilities to measure @xmath112 , and so we can let each term converge separately .",

    "however , if all eigenvectors induce a uniform distribution over the nodes of the graph , the limiting distribution is uniform , as is easily implied by the theorem .",
    "we show :    [ uniform ] let @xmath51 be a coined quantum walk on the cayley graph of an abelian group , such that all eigenvalues of @xmath51 are distinct .",

    "is there a simple description , perhaps via representation theory , of the limiting distribution for quantum walks on cayley graphs of non - abelian groups ?    a very interesting question is how to use quantum walks in order to speed up algorithms .",
    "one way to do that is via speeding up the convergence time , however it is still an open question to give an example in which fast sampling can not be done in an easy way classically .",
    "another direction to pursue is to find other ways of using the various curious features of quantum walks , rather than speeding up the convergence time .",

    "another way might be to investigate which quantum states can be generated using quantum walks .",
