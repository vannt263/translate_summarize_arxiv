    "the critical behavior of nonequilibrium systems has been amply studied in the last years @xcite .",
    "these studies consider stochastic lattice models and probabilistic cellular automata that evolves in time according to an irreversible dynamics , that is , a dynamics that lacks detailed balance .",
    "an important aspect to be considered is the role of symmetry .",
    "distinct systems with the same symmetry are expected to have similar critical behavior .",
    "the symmetry is to be found in the hamiltonian for reversible systems and in the dynamics for the irreversible systems . among the irreversible models ,",
    "there are models that have a reversible counterpart with the same symmetries . in this context",
    "it has been established the following statement : models with _ up - down _ symmetry , similar to the ising model , and defined on the same lattice , reversible or not , are in the same universality class @xcite .",
    "this has been verified numerically for a large number of models blote , tmm , mj , mendes , tamayo , nftd , wag .",
    "we remark that the same universal behavior is also observed for dynamic phase transitions in ising models in oscillating fields @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite , we have argued that this statement can be extended to models with other symmetries .",
    "in fact , in these works , we considered probabilistic cellular automata with dynamics that possess @xmath2 symmetry and verified that the values of the critical exponents , both static and dynamic , for irreversible systems are the same of the _ equilibrium _ three - state potts .",
    "that is , irreversibility is irrelevant regarding the values of the critical exponents in systems with the symmetry of the potts models . in this article",
    "we complete this analyzes by performing a systematic study of the cumulants at the critical point .",
    "we consider stochastic lattice gas models with @xmath3 symmetries : the three state potts model @xcite and two irreversible models , and focus our attention in the determination of the third and fourth order cumulants of the order parameter .",
    "we present a monte carlo study of these properties for models defined in a regular square lattice .",
    "our results show that the value of the cumulants , at the critical point , obtained for the present nonequilibrium models , and the ones associated to the two - dimensional three - state potts ( equilibrium ) model are the same within numerical errors .    the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we present the models to be studied . in section 3",
    ", it is defined the quantities of interest in the study of the phase transition and their scaling properties .",
    "the values of the cumulants in the limit of infinite temperature and zero temperature are discussed in section 4 .",
    "sections 5 and 6 show numerical calculations and the conclusions remarks .",
    "consider a regular lattice of @xmath4 sites in which each site can be in one of three states .",
    "at each site we attach a stochastic variable @xmath5 that takes the values 1 , 2 and 3 .",
    "the state of the system can be represented by @xmath6 .",
    "the time evolution equation for @xmath7 , the probability of state @xmath8 at time @xmath9 , is given by the master equation @xmath10 where the sum is over the @xmath11 configurations of the system .",
    "@xmath12 is the transition rate from a state @xmath13 to state @xmath8 , given that at the previous time step the system was in state @xmath14 .",
    "we will consider dynamics where @xmath15 and @xmath14 can differ only by one site which we call a one site dynamics . in this case",
    "we have    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the transition probability per site and @xmath18with @xmath19 @xmath20 the states are defined modulo 3 .",
    "the transition probability @xmath21 is invariant under certain symmetry operations , that is , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a symmetry operation . for the present models the symmetry operations @xmath23",
    "are those that act on all sites transforming each of them in the same manner .",
    "one of the symmetry operations is the rotation operation @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 another is the operator @xmath27 with state @xmath28 fixed . if the three states are placed on the vertices of a equilateral triangle they correspond , respectively , to a rotation operation by 120 degrees and a specular operation .",
    "these symmetry operations define then the point group c@xmath0 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the 3-state potts model is @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the interacting strength between the nearest neighbor sites @xmath32 and @xmath33 and @xmath34 is the kronecker delta .    to simulate the model we associate to it a dynamics .",
    "we consider an one - site dynamics as described by the master equation ( [ master ] ) . in the case",
    "the model to be analyzed is an equilibrium model it is necessary to use a transition probability @xmath17 that satisfy detailed balance condition .",
    "that is , in the stationary state we must have @xmath35 this dynamics can be defined by using the metropolis prescription .",
    "we choose a site @xmath32 and a state @xmath19 and calculate @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the difference between the energy of the state @xmath8 and the energy of  the state @xmath38 .",
    "the parameter @xmath39 is associated to the inverse of the temperature @xmath40 .",
    "numerically we studied the critical point associated to the model by performing monte carlo simulations .",
    "this procedure is described in section 6 .",
    "the nonequilibrium models are defined as follows . for the case of a square lattice",
    "we are denoting the transition probability @xmath41 by @xmath42 , where the sites 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 are the first neighbors of site 0 .       _ symmetric stochastic lattice gas model _",
    "\\(a ) if in the neighborhood of a given site there is a majority of sites which are in one state then , independently of the state of the site , it changes to the state of the majority with probability @xmath43 .",

    "\\(b ) if no state is in majority then the site assume either state with equal probability .",
    "according to the local rules of the model we have @xmath45and @xmath46the other rules are obtained by permutation of the neighboring sites and by cyclic permutation of the states .       _ majority stochastic lattice gas model _",
    "the model consists of a stochastic lattice gas model where the site transition probabilities follows similar rules of the majority vote model @xcite .",
    "the chosen site adopts the same value of the majority of the nearest neighbor sites with probability @xmath43 .",
    "it adopts the state of the other states with probability @xmath47 .",
    "if there is an equal number of nearest neighbors sites in the same state then the chosen site adopts each state with probability @xmath48 or it assumes the other state with probability @xmath49 .",
    "that is :    @xmath45    @xmath50 @xmath51 @xmath52 the other rules are obtained by permutation of the neighboring sites and by cyclic permutation of the states .",
    "it is straightforward to check that the transition probabilities @xmath53 , for both models , are invariant under the symmetry operations of the group @xmath3 .",
    "the nonequilibrium models , have the same symmetries as the hamiltonian of the three - state potts model , given in ( [ hamil ] ) although in the present case the models are not defined by a hamiltonian and do not satisfy detailed balance condition ( [ detail ] ) .",
    "that is , these models are microscopically irreversible .",
    "a convenient way to analyze the present models is through the use of the variables @xmath54 where @xmath19 assumes the values @xmath55 and @xmath56 and @xmath57 is the kronecker delta .",

    "moreover , the reduced cumulants @xmath103 and @xmath104 , defined in equations ( [ u24 ] ) and ( [ u23 ] ) , are expected to attain according to ( [ escal4 ] ) and ( [ escal3 ] ) a universal value at the critical point , that does not depend on the lattice size .",
    "the same behavior , of course , must hold for the reduced fourth - order cumulant @xmath105 given in equation ( [ binder ] ) .",

    "depending on the initial conditions the system will be with @xmath111 , for all sites in the lattice , or in state where @xmath112 , for all sites in the lattice , or in the state @xmath113 , for all sites in the lattice .",
    "the factor @xmath114 in equation ( [ x1n ] ) takes into account this fact .",

    "the system evolves in time according to the local rules and eventually reaches a steady state that can be of two types : a disordered steady state , where there is an equal average number of sites in each one of the three potts states ; either an ordered steady state characterized by the predominance of sites in one of the potts states .    the simulation of the equilibrium and the nonequilibrium models with @xmath3 symmetry was performed by considering square lattices with @xmath133 sites , and periodic boundary conditions .",
    "each simulation started with a configuration generated at random and averages over several simulations where taken to get the final results .",

    "we take @xmath148 and we analyze the behavior of the cumulants ( [ u24 ] ) and ( [ u23 ] ) as a function of the temperature and for different lattice sizes . as we can see in figure 1 and figure 2 when @xmath149 the cumulant @xmath150 and the cumulant @xmath151 @xmath152 , respectively , and it follows that @xmath153 and @xmath154 are universal .",

    "our simulations show that both models exhibit continuous phase transitions with the ordered steady state ( @xmath158 ) occurring at high values of @xmath43 . as @xmath43",
    "is decreased the transition takes place at a critical value @xmath159 , which is different for each model , and the system becomes disordered ( @xmath146 ) for @xmath43 less than @xmath159 .    using the finite size scaling relations ( [ escal3 ] ) and ( [ escal4 ] )",

    "it is worth to call the attention that this model is similar to the one considered by one of us in a previous work @xcite .",
    "both models evolves in time according to the same local markovian rules .",
    "however the one considered in reference @xcite is a probabilistic cellular automaton ( synchronous update ) whereas the present model evolves in time according to a sequential dynamics ( asynchronous update ) .",
    "as irreversible models are defined by the dynamics itself we do not have to expect the same value of the critical parameter .",
    "in fact they are different .",
    "we also observe that the results obtained previously @xcite for the fourth order cumulant for the probabilistic cellular automaton are not sufficient precise due to presence of large fluctuations .",
    "contrastingly , in the study of the stochastic lattice gas models considered here , we verified that the behavior of the cumulants , both of third and fourth order , are smooth .",

    "the phase with high symmetry is invariant under the symmetry operations of the symmetry group @xmath3 .",
    "we analyzed first , the equilibrium three states potts model , and then two irreversible models .",
    "all models have a continuous time evolution , governed by a master equation . in the first case",
    "the model is defined by an hamiltonian whereas in the second case they are defined only by transitions rates that do not obey the detailed balance condition . the phase transition that takes place , as an external parameter",
    "is varied , is a continuous phase transition from a disordered steady state to an ordered steady state . for the case of the equilibrium model ,",
    "the phase transition occurs when the temperature @xmath40 is varied and for the nonequilibrium cases when the parameter @xmath43 is varied .",
    "we introduced a set of homogeneous functions that are invariant under the symmetry operations of the group c@xmath0 . from these functions",
    "we define the order parameter and the cumulants .",
    "the critical points were estimated by numerical simulations on regular square lattices of different sizes and using finite size scaling theory . analyzing the cumulants we conclude that irreversibility plays an irrelevant role in the critical behavior and is not a property that might change the universal behavior .",
    "in fact , the fourth - order and the third - order cumulants attains universal values at the critical point and we found that this values are the same for the equilibrium system and for nonequilibrium systems , whenever periodic boundary conditions are considered .",
    "it is worthwhile to observe that the value of the cumulants may depend on the boundary conditions as was established for the equilibrium two dimensional models @xcite ."
