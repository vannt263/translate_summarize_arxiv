    "supersymmetric models @xcite are amongst the most promising fundamental theories to extend the standard model ( sm ) and describe physics at arbitrarily high energies .",
    "each of the sm particles has a partner differing by a half - unit of spin .",
    "if r - parity @xcite is conserved , supersymmetric particles are produced in pairs , and their decay leads to sm particles and to the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) , which is stable .",
    "cosmological arguments suggest that the lsp should be neutral and colorless .",
    "the lightest neutralino @xmath3 , which is a mixture of the superpartners of the neutral gauge and higgs bosons , fulfills these conditions . in the following",
    ", it is assumed that r - parity is conserved .",
    "since the lsp is weakly interacting , it escapes detection and provides the missing transverse energy ( ) signature . in @xmath0 collisions , squarks ( @xmath4 ) and gluinos ( @xmath5 ) , the superpartners of quarks and gluons ,",
    "would be abundantly produced , if sufficiently light , by the strong interaction , leading to final states containing jets and .",
    "the limits discussed in this note have been obtained in the model of minimal supergravity ( msugra ) @xcite .",
    "the inclusive searches for squarks and gluinos have been performed in three separate analyses @xcite . the analysis strategy was to optimize for three benchmark regions of the msugra parameter space .",
    "a `` dijet '' analysis was optimized at low @xmath6 for events containing a pair of acoplanar jets , as expected from @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "a `` gluino '' analysis was optimized at high @xmath6 for events with at least four jets , as expected from @xmath9 .",
    "finally , a `` 3-jets '' analysis was optimized for events with at least three jets , as expected from @xmath10 .",
    "the benchmark for this analysis is the case where @xmath11 .",
    "the sm processes leading to events with jets and real in the final state ( `` sm backgrounds '' ) are the production of @xmath12 or @xmath13 bosons in association with jets ( @xmath14+jets ) , of pairs of vector bosons ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) or top quarks ( @xmath18 ) , and of single top quarks .",
    "the neutrinos from the decays @xmath19 and @xmath20 , with the @xmath12 boson produced directly or coming from a top quark decay , generate the signature .",
    "while the @xmath21jets events are an irreducible background , most of the @xmath12 boson leptonic decays leading to an electron or a muon were identified , and the corresponding events rejected .",
    "however , a charged lepton from @xmath12 boson decay can escape detection or fail the identification criteria .",
    "such @xmath12+jets events therefore exhibit the jets plus signature .",
    "finally , multijet production also leads to a final state with jets and when one or more jets are mismeasured ( `` multijet background '' ) .",
    "each analysis required at least two jets and substantial ( @xmath22 40  gev ) . in the `` 3-jets '' and `` gluino '' analyses ,",
    "a third and fourth jet were required , respectively .",
    "the transverse momenta of the jets up to the third jet had to be greater than 35  gev and greater than 20  gev for the fourth jet .",
    "the two leading jets ( jets with largest transverse momenta ) were required : to be confirmed by tracks originating from the primary vertex and to be in the central region of the calorimeter , @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the jet pseudorapidity calculated from the detector center .",
    "the track confirmation requirement removes events with spurious due to the choice of an incorrect primary vertex .",
    "the acoplanarity , i.e. the azimuthal angle between the two leading jets , was required to be smaller than 165@xmath25 . in all three analyses ,",
    "a veto on isolated electrons or muons with transverse momentum greater than 10  gev was applied to reject background events containing leptonic decays .",
    "the azimuthal angles between the and the first and the second jet , ( @xmath26 and @xmath27 respectively ) , were used to remove events where the energy of one jet was mismeasured , generating aligned with that jet . in the `` dijet '' analysis , the minimum azimuthal angle @xmath28 between the and any jet with @xmath29  gev was required to be greater than @xmath30 to further suppress the multijet background .    the two final cuts on and on @xmath31 , where the sum is over all jets with @xmath29  gev and @xmath32 , were optimized by minimizing the expected upper limit on the cross section in the absence of signal .",
    "the minimum ( , @xmath33 ) cuts were ( 225 , 325 ) , ( 175 , 375 ) and ( 100 , 400 ) gev for the `` dijet '' , `` 3-jets '' and `` gluino '' analysis respectively . the multijet background contribution was estimated by fitting the distribution below 60  gev with an exponential function , after subtraction of the sm background processes , and subsequently extrapolating this function above the chosen cut value .",
    "this contribution was found to be negligible and was conservatively ignored in the limit setting .",
    "the numbers of events observed in the data are in agreement with the sm background expectation in the three analyses .",
    "the number of events passing at least one of the three analyses is 31 while the sm expectation is @xmath34  ( stat.)@xmath35  ( syst . )",
    "events . fig .",
    "1 shows the excluded domain at 95% c.l . in the gluino - squark mass plane with an integrated luminosity of 2.1 fb@xmath2 .",
    "the observed ( expected ) limits on the squark and gluino masses are 392 ( 391 )  gev and 327 ( 332 )  gev .",
    "limits were also derived for the particular case of @xmath11 where squarks and gluino masses below 390  gev are excluded .",
    "the mass splitting between the supersymmetric partners of the top quark ( @xmath36 ) is proportional to the mass of the top quark .",
    "this can make one of the stops the lightest of all squarks . in this search @xcite , the stop quark",
    "is taken to be the next to the lightest supersymmetric particle and is assumed to decay into a charm quark and a @xmath3 via loop decay .",
    "the final state consists of two acoplanar charm jets and missing transverse energy .",
    "the backgrounds to this channel are similar as to the generic squarks and gluinos search and the multijet background is estimated in the same way as well , as described in the previous section .",
    "the search strategy for @xmath36 involves three steps which include the application of the selection criteria on kinematical variables , heavy flavor tagging and optimization of the final selection depending on @xmath36 and @xmath3 masses .",
    "the selection cuts require exactly two jets , within @xmath24 of 1.5 and confirmed by tracks originating from the primary vertex . the leading and trailing jets have to have a transverse momentum more than 40 and 20  gev respectively and separated by an azimuthal angle of less than 165@xmath25 .",
    "events with isolated electrons , muons and tracks are removed to reduce the backgrounds with @xmath12 decays .",
    "several topological cuts on the combination of and @xmath33 are further applied to reduce the multijet contribution with mismeasured . to enhance the rate of events with charm jets in the final state at least one of the jets is required to be heavy flavor tagged with s neural network ( nn ) based tagging tool .",
    "the requirement on the nn output is kept loose to get a high efficiency for detection of charm jets ( @xmath37 30% ) with a @xmath37 6% probability for a light parton jet to be mistakenly tagged .    at the final stage of the analysis ,",
    "additional selection criteria on three kinematic variables : , @xmath33 and @xmath38 , where @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) is the largest ( smallest ) azimuthal separation between a jet and , are optimized by maximizing the expected lower limit on the neutralino mass for a given @xmath41 . in all cases a requirement of @xmath42  gev is imposed .",
    "no contamination remains from multijet background at this point in the analysis , which is therefore neglected while setting the limit . using the assumption that @xmath36 decays into a charm quark and a neutralino with 100% branching fraction and the nominal @xmath36 pair production cross section ,",
    "the largest @xmath41 excluded by this analysis is 155  gev , for a neutralino mass of 70  gev at the 95% c.l .",
    "the excluded region in the @xmath36@xmath3 mass plane with 1 fb@xmath2 of data is shown in fig .  2 .",
    "if the @xmath43 and @xmath44 modes are kinematically forbidden , then stop quarks will decay into a lepton , a bottom quark and a sneutrino via @xmath45 . the event signature for",
    "stop pair production will be two b jets , a pair of isolated leptons and missing transverse energy .",
    "a search is performed with 1.1 fb@xmath2 of data in the most sensitive channel where one lepton is a muon and the other one an electron @xcite , which has the largest branching ratio and the smallest backgrounds among the three leptonic decay modes .",
    "the sm backgounds to this channel come from processes with isolated electron and muon pairs : @xmath46 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath47 .",
    "the second background source is due to either mis - identified electrons , muons or jets , mismeasured , or electrons or muons from multijet processes which pass lepton isolation requirements .",
    "this multijet background is estimated from data .",
    "the selection cuts require events with an electron and a muon .",
    "jets , electron and muon have to be isolated from each other .",
    "the analysis is using further a set of cuts on the azimuthal separation between the electron , muon and to reduce the multijet background .",
    "the is required to be larger than 30  gev .",
    "the exclusion limits have been derived from the shapes of the @xmath33 and @xmath48 distributions , where @xmath48 is defined as the scalar sum of the electron , muon and missing transverse energy .",
    "the exclusion domain is shown in fig .  3 in the ( @xmath49 ) plane .",
