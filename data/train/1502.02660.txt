    "thus the frequency of the measurement mode needed to be recalibrated for each flux voltage in fig . s2 .",
    "furthermore , to track the qubit in this frequency range with sufficient contrast , the designated measurement mode needed to be changed such that it was farther and farther away from the qubit . for each change of measurement mode , there is a horizontal black line in fig .",

    "s6 , for the symmetric two mode system , it is shown that spectral narrowing appears for a range of the rabi rate @xmath18 .",

    ", the proliferation of the dressed states in the high excitation manifolds leads to enhanced generation of coherence among the dressed states from a collective interference , which relies on the near resonance of many dressed state level spacings .",
    "concomitant with the collective suppression of dissipation for the steady state then is the rise in the steady state occupation .",
    "simulations of such a massively multimode system demands more computational resources due to the growth of the hilbert space .",
    "more extensive results will be presented elsewhere .",
    "spectral narrowing is generally very insensitive to the qubit frequency . for finite drive - qubit detuning @xmath99 ,",
    "the effective rabi rate is @xmath100 , with @xmath101 the amplitude of the drive .",
    "based on the above analysis , spectral narrowing occurs when @xmath18 is within the range @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is again the mode frequency measured with respect to the drive ( i.e. its detuning ) , and @xmath104 is generally determined by the number of modes , the coupling strength and the dissipation . for relatively small detuning @xmath99 and large rabi rate @xmath101 , this gives a large effective range of qubit frequency @xmath105 over which narrowing occurs .",
    "it is worth noting that even if the drive is not resonant with the qubit and the two modes are not symmetric around the drive , spectral narrowing still exists in our simulation .    for a single mode system",
    ", it was argued that spectral narrowing requires that the qubit decay rate @xmath106 be comparable to the coupling strength @xmath107 , i.e. the moderate coupling regime  @xcite .",
    "we therefore study the effect of qubit decay rate @xmath106 on steady state properties of the two mode system .",
    "s7(a ) presents photon number @xmath91 versus rabi rate for a different @xmath106 value . from this result",
    ", we conclude that spectral narrowing survives when going from moderate coupling to the strong coupling regime , which we attribute to the fact that the eigenstates of the multimode system in high excitation manifolds are more densely spaced than in the single mode system .",
    "dynamically generated coherence between these closely spaced states then results in spectral narrowing of many modes simultaneously ."

    "<S> the transmon qubit @xcite is capacitively coupled near the end of the cavity , at an antinode . </S>",
    "<S> the qubit consists of two large islands and a pair of parallel junctions in a squid - loop geometry . </S>",
    "<S> while there is an on - chip flux bias line , a superconducting magnet was installed around the device to tune the qubit frequency without detrimental thermal heating . </S>",
    "<S> the device was extensively wire - bonded to the circuit board to ensure proper connection of all ground planes and reduce the effect of spurious modes . </S>",
    "<S> the device was cooled to  11 mk in a dilution refrigerator , and measured using standard low - temperature microwave circuit elements including an iq mixer , isolators , and a hemt amplifier . + </S>",
