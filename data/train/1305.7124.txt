    "the fiber bundle model , since its introduction @xcite , has been studied widely as a prototypical model of failure dynamics @xcite . this discrete element model , involving disorder and non - linear dynamics ( due to thresholds )",
    ", also enables engineers to apply it to analyse the breaking properties of real materials ( e.g , , fiber reinforced composites @xcite ) and its simplicity and occasional analytic tractability @xcite has attracted statistical physicists , specifically for its intriguing dynamical critical behaviors @xcite .",
    "there are mainly two extreme versions of this model .",
    "both the versions consider a bunch of fibers ( hooke springs ) hanging from a rigid ceiling and a platform is connected to the ends of these fibers and a load hangs from that platform .",
    "each fiber has a given limit or load - carrying threshold ( usually taken randomly from some distribution function ) , beyond which it fails .",
    "completely different behaviors are observed when the elastic property of the lower platform changes .",
    "two extreme cases arise when the platform is either absolutely rigid ( global load sharing case ) or absolutely soft ( though inextensible ; local load sharing case ) .",
    "when a fiber breaks in the former case , its extra load is equally shared by all other remaining fibers , due to rigidity of the lower platform . in the latter case , however , due to local deformation of the platform , the load of the broken fiber is only to be carried by nearest surviving neighbours ( stress concentration occurs around the failure or breaking ) .",
    "while in the global load sharing version the load at which the system completely fails scales with system size linearly , for the local load sharing case the increase is only sub - linear ( in fact @xmath0 ; @xmath1 being system size @xcite ) .",
    "the implication being , the critical load per fiber @xmath2 at which the system fails , becomes finite for the global load sharing case and goes to zero in the large system size limit for the local load sharing case .",
    "therefore the observations like divergence of relaxation time , proper scale free size distribution of avalanches , if any , are not seen in the local load sharing case ; unlike in the global load sharing version , where these can be analyzed in detail @xcite .    ] .,width=264 ]    however , the situation can be quite different if one makes the initial applied load localized ( at an arbitrarily chosen central site ; see fig .",
    "[ setup ] ) in a local load sharing fiber bundle model in greater than one dimension ( for one dimension the damage interface can not increase ) .",
    "let this load be increased at a slow but constant rate .",
    "initially no load is present on any fiber except for the one at the central site .",
    "as the applied load increases beyond the failure threshold of this central fiber , it breaks and the load carried by it is redistributed among its nearest neighbours and so on . here",
    "we study two versions of the model . in model",
    "i : in general , whenever a fiber breaks , the load carried by that fiber is redistributed equally among its nearest surviving neighbour(s ) . in this way , the fibers which are newly exposed to the load , say , after an avalanche , have a relatively low load compared to the ones which are accumulating load shares from the earlier failures and are still surviving .",
    "as we shall see later , this helps in maintaining a compact structure of the cluster or patch of the broken fibers .",
    "this local force redistribution is justified from the point of view that the newly exposed fibers are presumably further away from the point of loading and therefore have to carry a smaller fraction of the load at the original central site .    the fibers on the perimeter of the failed or damaged region , which together are carrying the entire load , increase in number with time .",
    "hence the load per fiber decreases during an ongoing avalanche , which is assumed to be a much faster process compared to the external load increase .",
    "however , as the load on the bundle increases at a constant ( but slow ) rate , the load per fiber along the boundary will tend to increase .",
    "eventually , a dynamically stable state will occur when the load per fiber will fluctuate around a stable value and the system has reached a self - organized state .",
    "in this dynamical state , failure of fibers in the process of avalanches is seen to have a scale free size distribution , suggesting the state to be a self - organized critical one .",
    "we study this model numerically to estimate the avalanche size and other exponent values .",
    "these values are close to those found for stochastic sandpile model or manna model , within our numerical accuracies .",
    "we then study a simpler version of this model , model ii , in which the load of a broken fiber is equally shared by all the surviving fibers that have atleast one broken neighbour , i.e. it is equally distributed along the boundary of the broken or damaged patch . due to the fact that local fluctuations are ignored in the process of load redistribution , this version is analytically tractable using a mean - field like approach and the numerical results compare well .    as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ config1 ] , this version of the fiber bundle model ensures an advancing interfacial ( mode - i ) fracture . this topic",
    "is widely studied over decades both theoretically and experimentally ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "particularly , in the plexiglas experiment @xcite two plates were taken and disorder was introduced by sandblasting and then were joined together , making a transparent block with an easy plane .",
    "interfacial ( mode - i ) fracture was then studied with it .",
    "a similar situation with this model would arise if one of the plates ( or softer surface ) could be pulled from the middle .",
    "the advantage of the present situation for experiment and in particular for simulations is that one is free from the need of introducing a cut - off scale by hand as dissipation comes naturally in this model with the increase of effective system size with dynamics .",
    "this is a more desireable situation since artificial dissipation scales often cause problems in estimating the exponent values , which had to avoided by measuring a different quantity instead @xcite .",
    "below we first present the numerical results for the nearest neighbour load sharing model ( model i ) and then go over to the simpler version of uniform load sharing along boundary ( model ii ) , giving the analytical estimates for the later and comparing them with numerical results .",
    "as mentioned before , usually one does not find a finite critical load for local load sharing fiber bundle models .",
    "this is the result of extreme value of statistics , in which the strength of the sample is determined solely by its weakest point . in that case , as the load , no matter how small , is applied system wide , there will always be a large enough weak patch , which will be broken and due to concentration of the load on the boundary and the fact that more load is nucleated if the fracture progresses , the patch keeps growing , leading to a system wide failure without any further input from outside .",
    "however , the situation will be very different when the initial load is applied locally and not on all elements of the system .",
    "initially we apply a load on one fiber , say the one at the middle .",
    "we then continue to increase the load at a very slow rate .",
    "when this fiber breaks , the load carried by it is redistributed equally among its four neighbours . since we keep on increasing the load ( only on the fibers that are already carrying a non - zero load ) , this breaking and redistribution dynamics continues . in general , whenever a fiber breaks , the load carried by that fiber is equally shared by the surviving fiber(s ) nearest to it .",
    "when the islands break ( all four neighbours already broken ) , its load is redistributed among its nearest surviving neighbor(s ) ( searched along the perpendicular axes ; other searchings are slow and do not change the critical behavior ) , no matter how far they are located . note that in this way of redistribution , the fibers that are newly exposed to the load have a rather low load per fiber compared to the ones which are gathering and withstanding the loads of broken fibers from a few steps earlier .",
    "this ensures that the compact structure of the patch of the broken fibers is maintained , since a rather weak but new fiber is more likely to survive than a stronger but old one , thereby eliminating the possibilities of fingering like effects from the patch boundary .",
    "also note that , following the usual definition of avalanche , we do not increase the external load when a fiber breaks or more fibers break due to load redistribution .",
    "in other words , the process of load redistribution happens in a much faster time scale than load increase , which is quasistatic .    , i.e. the number of fibers sharing the load is plotted against time for both models for a single realisation .",
    "it increases on average but has jumps of increase and decrease as well .",
    "( b ) and ( c ) show the probability distribution @xmath3 of the sizes of the jumps @xmath4 for model i and model ii respectively , all measured after the time the system has reached a steady state.,width=340 ]    ] ) for nearest surviving neighbour load redistribution ( model i ) .",
    "the saturation is close to @xmath5 .",
    "the inset shows the stationary distribution of the load per fiber value ( @xmath6 ) and the failure threshold values ( @xmath7 ) of the surviving fibers on the boundary.,width=340 ]      as we shall see , the application of load at a point and subsequent localized redistribution rules , bring the system into a self - organized critical state .",
    "one of the signatures of self - organization is the stationarity in macroscopic quantities . in this case",
    ", the most important quantity is the average value of the load per fiber @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the slowly increasing load and @xmath10 is the effective system size , i.e. number of fibers carrying the load , which also increases with time ( see fig .",
    "[ jump ] ) .",
    "we find that this quantity stabilises , i.e. becomes time independent after some initial transients .",
    "the load carried by each fiber is not same .",
    "we measured the probability density function @xmath6 of the load of the fiber , i.e. the probability that a fiber has load between @xmath11 and @xmath12 is @xmath13 .",
    "in fact the entire distribution of the load per fiber , and not only its first moment , becomes stable .",
    "similarly , we also find stability in the probability density function of the failure threshold values of the surviving fibers @xmath7 , each of which carry a non - zero load .",
    "again , @xmath14 denotes the probability that a surviving fiber carrying a non - zero load has the failure threshold value between @xmath11 and @xmath12 . in fig .",
    "[ load - sat - loc ] the saturation of the average load per fiber value is shown .",
    "the inset shows the stationary distribution of the load per fiber values ( @xmath6 ) and failure threshold values ( @xmath7 ) . while these results are for the initially uniform ( in [ @xmath15 ) threshold distribution , the same phenomenon occurs for other threshold distributions , like weibull , gaussian , triangular etc .",
    "the average stationary values change for different distributions .",
    "later we will give analytical estimations of these stationary distributions for a simplified model , which match well with simulation results .",
    "note that usually the two basic ingredients of a self - organized critical system are external drive and dissipation @xcite . in the present case , although we have an external drive , there is no explicit dissipation .",
    "but the effect of dissipation enters the system from the fact that the effective system size ( @xmath10 : number of surviving fibers carrying non - zero load ) is an increasing function of time .",
    "as indicated before , we follow a quasistatic load increase protocol . in effect , this means increasing the load per fiber uniformly on all those surviving fibers that already carry a non - zero load , until the weakest ( having the smallest difference between load and failure threshold ) fiber breaks .",
    "then we wait for the system to adjust by breaking the fibers and redistribution of the loads , and come to a state when no further fiber breaks .",
    "all the fibers broken in between , constitute one avalanche .",
    "this process is repeated in every time step .",
    "the size distribution of avalanches @xmath16",
    "( @xmath17 being the size of avalanche , i.e. number of fibers broken in an avalanche ) measured in this way are plotted in fig .",
    "[ avalanche - loc - comb ] .",
    "this shows a power - law distribution @xmath18 with exponent value close to @xmath19 .",
    "this exponent value remains unchanged when other types of threshold distributions ( not shown here ) are used .",
    "we have also measured the duration of an avalanche .",
    "this is defined as the number of times ( @xmath20 ) the load is redistributed during one process of avalanche .",
    "the probability distribution of duration @xmath21 is also a power - law decay ( @xmath22 ) with exponent value close to @xmath23 ( see inset of fig . [ avalanche - loc - comb ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that avalanche size distribution exponent value is rather close to the stochastic sandpile or manna universality class @xcite .",
    "apart from these , the size distributions of the changes in effective system size ( @xmath4 ) was measured , again after the system has reached a stationary state .",
    "this distribution is also a power - law with exponent value close to @xmath24 ( see fig .",
    "[ jump ] ) .    .",
    "inset : distribution of the duration of an avalanche is shown , which is also a power - law decay with exponent value @xmath25.,width=340 ]",
    "a simpler version of the model studied so far is the one where the load carried by a broken fiber is equally redistributed among all the fibers that have at least one broken neighbour .",
    "this is another way of saying that the load is redistributed uniformly along the entire boundary , once a fiber breaks ( see fig .",
    "[ config2 ] ) .    ] .,width=264 ]    since the size of the boundary is large after the transients , the behaviour of the model in the present form is tractable via a mean field like approach .",
    "below we first discuss the stationary distribution functions of load per fiber value and failure thresholds for different initial failure threshold distributions ; comparing the estimates with numerical results .",
    "then we do the same for avalanche size distribution .    ] ) for model ii ( i.e. , uniform load redistribution along the patch boundary ) .",
    "the solid line is the analytical estimate ( @xmath26 ) and the simulation result is close to that value .",
    "the inset shows the comparison of the simulation results and analytical estimates of the saturation load per fiber value , when the threshold is distributed uniformly between [ @xmath27.,width=340 ]          same as the earlier version of the model , the load distribution and the threshold distribution along the patch boundary reaches a stationary state after some transient . in this case , however , one can also make an analytical estimate along with the numerical simulations , to get a good agreement .",
    "consider the failure thresholds to be distributed uniformly between the limits [ @xmath27 .",
    "first let us take the case when @xmath28 .",
    "we follow the algorithm for load increase as stated before .",
    "if one measures the average load per fiber with time @xmath29 ( one time step being one avalanche ) , one finds that after a transient it saturates to a given value ( see fig .",
    "[ load - sat ] ) . for this case , the value is close to @xmath26 . in analytically estimating it we assume that dynamically all values of force ( between [ @xmath15 , i.e. the range of the threshold distribution ) are generated with equal probability .",
    "so , the probability that a load between @xmath11 and @xmath12 is applied on the fibers is @xmath30 ( unnormalized ; @xmath31 is a constant independent of @xmath11 since the force distribution is assumed to be uniform ) . now among these fibers , only the ones with failure threshold greater than @xmath11 will survive .",
    "the probability that the fibers have failure threshold greater than @xmath11 is proportional to @xmath32 ( since we are considering threshold distribution to be unuiform in [ @xmath15 ) .",
    "therefore , the probability that a surviving fiber has a load between @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the joint probability that a load between @xmath11 and @xmath12 is applied on the fibers _ and _ the fibers have failure thresholds higher than @xmath11 , which is given by @xmath33 . from normalization @xmath34 , one has @xmath35 .",
    "so , the probability density function of the surviving fibers having load @xmath11 is @xmath36 , which compares well with numerical estimate ( fig .",
    "[ dist ] ) . of course",
    ", the average load per fiber is @xmath37 , which is again close to what we see numerically ( fig . [ load - sat ] ) .",
    "similarly , the probability that the fibers in the system have a failure threshold between @xmath11 and @xmath12 is @xmath38 ( unnormalized ; @xmath39 is independent of @xmath11 since the threshold distribution is uniform in [ @xmath15 ) .",
    "now , the probability that a load equal to or less than @xmath11 is applied on the fibers is proportional to @xmath11 ( since force distribution is uniform ) .",
    "hence the probability that a surviving fiber has a threshold between @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the joint probability of a fiber having its threshold between @xmath11 and @xmath12 _ and _ load below @xmath11 .",
    "this probability is @xmath40 .",
    "normalization gives @xmath41 i.e. , @xmath42 .",

    "[ dist ] .",
    "now we go to the case when @xmath44 , i.e. , the threshold distribution function has a lower cut - off .",
    "now , since all fibers have threshold higher than @xmath45 and we have assumed before that force is uniformly distributed , the probability density function for force will be uniform between [ @xmath46 and then decreasing linearly as before ( can be obtained along the same line as before ) . from normalization condition ,",

    "one can also calculate the probability density function for threshold with finite @xmath45 @xmath50 this compares well with numerical result ( also shown in fig .",
    "[ dist ] ) .",
    "if we now calculate the average force , it comes out to be @xmath51 ,",

    "[ load - sat ] . of course",
    ", we get back @xmath26 for @xmath28 .      to show universality of the above phenomenon with respect to different threshold distributions , we have checked it for different threshold distributions ( gaussian , triangular etc .",
    "we show the case of weibull distribution , which is more abundant in real situations .    ) and failure thresholds ( @xmath7 ) of the fibers in the boundary of the broken patch for weibull threshold distribution with @xmath52 and @xmath53 for model ii .",
    "the solid lines are analytical predictions ( eqs .",
    "( [ wei - force ] ) and ( [ wei - th ] ) ) and the points are simulation results . the inset shows the time variation of the average load per fiber value , which saturates close to the analytical estimate @xmath54.,width=340 ]    a general form of the weibull distribution is @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are two parameters .",
    "let us consider the particular case when @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "as before , the probability that the threshold is greater than @xmath11 is proportional to @xmath58 .",
    "now since the probability density function for force is uniform , the probability of a fiber having load between @xmath11 and @xmath12 is @xmath59 , with @xmath60 ( unnormalized ) since the force distribution is assumed to be uniform . as before , the normalization condition would require @xmath61 giving @xmath62 .",
    "hence the normalized probability density function for the load on the surviving fibers will be @xmath63 similarly , the probability that the load is lower than @xmath11 is proportional to @xmath11 . using the form for threshold distribution ( @xmath64 ) , it is straightforward to get the probability density function for threshold distribution of the survived fibers , which is @xmath65 both of these functions are in good agreement with numerical simulations ( see fig . [ weibull ] ) .",
    "also the saturation value of the average load per fiber can be calculated as @xmath66 which is also in good agreement with simulation value ( see inset fig . [ weibull ] ) .",
    "the size distribution of avalanches are measured as before .",
    "now we find the size distribution exponent to be close to @xmath67 ( see fig .",
    "[ avalanche - comb ] ) , which is in agreement with the scaling prediction of avalanche size distributions in soc models for mean field @xcite , i.e. @xmath68 , where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the surviving probability decay exponent and number of particle growth exponent respectively , both of which are 1 in mean field , giving @xmath71 .",
    "note that similar exponent value was obtained before when one measures avalanches only near the critical point in global load sharing models @xcite and also in other versions of self - organized models with fiber regeneration @xcite .",
    "we also measure the distribution of avalanche duration .",
    "the duration distribution is a power - law with exponent value close to @xmath72 ( see inset of fig .",
    "[ avalanche - comb ] ) , which is again in agreement with scaling predictions of soc models in mean field , i.e. @xmath73 .",
    "the size distribution of the changes in effective system size is also close to @xmath74 ( see fig . [ jump ] ) .    , which is also our estimate from scaling arguments .",
    "inset : the distribution of the duration of an avalanche is plotted for model ii .",
    "this shows a power - law decay with exponent value @xmath72.,width=340 ]    now to estimate the value of the avalanche size exponent , we first assume that the average load per fiber on the perimeter of the damaged region has a distribution which is gaussian around its mean : @xmath75 .",
    "hence , on a dimensional analysis , mean - squared fluctuation @xmath76 . also the avalanche size @xmath17 scales as @xmath77 since it may be viewed as the number of broken fibers after a load increase of @xmath78 .",
    "this gives @xmath79 the probability of an avalanche being of the size between @xmath17 and @xmath80 is @xmath81 .",
    "now , the deviation from the critical point scales @xcite with the cumulative size of all avalanches upto that point ; giving @xmath82 .",
    "if we take @xmath18 , then @xmath83 comparing eqs .",
    "( [ sig1 ] ) and ( [ sig2 ] ) therefore we have @xmath84 .",
    "so the probability density function for the avalanche size becomes @xmath85 , which fits well with simulation results ( fig .",
    "[ avalanche - comb ] ) .    note",
    "that we have also checked these results for triangular lattices , where the nearest neighbours are six .",
    "as one can see , the analytical estimates are independent of lattice topology , hence predict same behaviour for triangular lattice as well , which is what we get numerically as well ( not shown here ) .",
    "here we study the local load sharing fiber bundle model in a square lattice , with the load being initially applied only at a central site .",
    "the load is slowly increased and a broken patch grows in the middle of the system , the boundary of which carries the entire load . since the boundary increases , the load per fiber reaches a stationary value after some time and responses of the system in that state is scale free , indicating a self - organized critical state for the system .",
    "we study two versions of this model . in model",
    "i : after the failure of the central fiber , the load is shared by its four nearest neighbouring sites , which initially had no load on them .",
    "once any of them fails , its load will be shared equally by its nearest surviving fiber(s ) and so on .",
    "these load shares accumulate on all the fibers on the perimeter and grows with time since their respective appearance on the perimeter of the damaged central region .",
    "this may be interpreted as the fact that further the surviving fibers are from the central point , lower are the loads on them and closest fiber ( also the longest surviving fiber on the perimeter ) to the central site accumulates the maximum load share . as stated before",
    ", the model reaches a stationary state after some transients .",
    "this leads to a self - organized dynamics of failure in the model .",
    "we have studied the breaking statistics in such a self - organized dynamical state .",
    "while the usual ingredients for self organization are external drive and dissipation @xcite , in our model the latter is apparently absent .",
    "however a similar effect is coming from the fact that the effective system size , i.e. the perimeter length of the patch of the broken fibers , is not a constant but increases with the increase of load with time .",
    "this leads the system into a self - organized critical state , from which if one makes a departure ( by increasing the load ) the response of the system ( size of the avalanche and its duration ) can be of any size , leading to scale free dynamics .",
    "particularly , we observe , in the avalanche size distribution , exponent value is @xmath19 ( see fig .",
    "[ avalanche - loc - comb ] ) and the duration distribution of an avalanches has an exponent value @xmath25 ( see inset of fig .",
    "[ avalanche - loc - comb ] ) .",
    "also the change in the effective system size follows a power - law with exponent close to @xmath86 ( see fig . [ jump ] ) .",
    "we have checked , the exponent values do not change if the identities of the nearest neighbour fibers ( along lattice axes , or along diagonals as well ) are changed .",
    "also we have checked the universality using different ( e.g. , weibull , uniform between [ @xmath27 and so on ) fiber strength distributions .",
    "these exponent values are close to what are seen in manna model .",
    "we then studied a simpler version of this model , model ii , where the load redistribution is uniform along the boundary of the broken patch .",
    "this reduces the fluctuation in the system significantly ( see figs .",
    "[ config1],[config2 ] for a visual comparison ) , and brings the system to a mean - field limit .",
    "the average load per fiber value still saturates to a finite value .",
    "we have made an estimate of this average value for a system with uniform threshold distribution between [ @xmath27 , and also for a weibull distribution with certain values of parameters .",
    "it turns out , for uniform distribution with @xmath28 , the probability density function for a surviving fiber to have load @xmath11 can be calculated to be @xmath49 and average value of @xmath87 is estimated to be @xmath26 , which is in close agreement with simulation results .",
    "however , for non - zero values of @xmath45 , we find significant departure from the analytical estimate ( given by eq .",
    "( [ avgsigma ] ) ) .",
    "similar estimates for weibull distribution with @xmath52 and @xmath53 is made , where this saturation value comes out to be @xmath54 , again very close to simulation results .",
    "we also present a scaling theory to predict the avalanche size distribution in this case .",
    "the exponent value for the size distribution is estimated to be @xmath67 , which is in close agreement with the numerical results ( fig .",
    "[ avalanche - comb ] ) .",
    "this is of course the mean field limit of self - organized criticality @xcite .",
    "the exponent value ( @xmath88 ; see inset of fig .",
    "[ avalanche - comb ] ) for the distribution of duration of avalanche also matches with the mean field estimate .",
    "note that one could not have obtained this self - organization in an one dimensional array of local load sharing fibers , due to the finite extension of the damaged region ( two fibers on the two sides of the damaged region will have to carry the load ) .",
    "this self - organization therefore occurs only for two and higher dimensions .",
    "also note that a long range load transfer , with initial load along a line , requires an explicit dissipation term to get self - organized dynamics @xcite .",
    "similar efforts were made in capturing the morphology of the fractured surfaces by considering the elastic modulus of the lower plane of the model @xcite .    in conclusion ,",
    "the self - organizing dynamics of failure in this local load sharing fiber bundle model ( in more than one dimension ) has interesting critical ( scale free ) behaviour .",
    "the models show mode - i damage propagation without having to put a dissipation scale by hand . in the nearest neighbour load sharing version ( model i ) , the avalanche size distribution follows a power - law with exponent value close to @xmath19 .",
    "the distribution for the duration of avalanche follows a power - law with exponent value close to @xmath25 .",
