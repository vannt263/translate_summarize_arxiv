    "discovery of giant magnetoresistance ( mr ) in magnetic multilayers @xcite , which consist of alternating ferromagnetic metal ( f ) and normal metal ( n ) layers , stimulated intensive studies of spin - polarized transport through layered magnetic structures @xcite . in a paper",
    "@xcite the semiclassical theory of mr in magnetic multilayers has been developed for geometry , in which the electric current is perpendicular to the layers ( cpp geometry ) .",
    "it has been shown that when thickness of the metals in a stack is small compared with the spin diffusion length , the magnetoresistance of multilayers can be calculated within the two - current series - resistor model @xcite . in this case",
    "mr is expressed via the resistance of the f / n interface ( boundary resistance ) , @xmath0r_{f / n}^{\\ast } $ ] , and the bulk specific resistance of the ferromagnetic layer , @xmath1\\rho _ { f}^{\\ast } $ ] @xcite . in these expressions @xmath2 and @xmath3 are parameters of spin asymmetry of the boundary and bulk scattering resistances .",
    "it follows from works @xcite that their linear combination , @xmath4 , determines sign of mr in layered @xmath5\\times n$ ] structures ( @xmath6 is the thickness of the ferromagnetic layers ) . in works @xcite positive ( inverse ) mr due to negative value of @xmath2 in @xmath7 multilayers has been observed for the first time .",
    "theoretical calculations of the boundary resistance @xcite established the strong influence of the spin - dependent band structure of ferromagnetic metals on magnetoresistance . using the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite and transmission probabilities through the f / n interface , calculated earlier from first principles @xcite , stiles and penn @xcite obtained from numerical calculations a negative value of @xmath8 for the @xmath9 interface , and a positive @xmath2 for iron - group ferromagnet - noble metal interfaces .",
    "however , conditions on the parameters of contacting materials resulting in negative or positive values of spin - asymmetry of the boundary resistance were not discussed in the above papers .    in this paper",
    "we derive for the first time quasiclassical boundary conditions for electrochemical potentials of diffusive ferromagnetic and normal metals , which can be used for solution of a wide class of problems in spintronics .",
    "our expression for the boundary resistance accurately accounts for the momentum conservation law as well as essential gradients of the chemical potentials .",
    "we establish conditions on parameters of the contacting metals , at which spin asymmetry of the boundary resistance has a positive or negative sign",
    ". dependence of the spin asymmetry and the boundary resistance on the exchange splitting of the conduction band offers one more way to estimate spin polarization of conduction band of ferromagnetic metals .",
    "we give an example of such an estimation .",
    "we derive boundary conditions for electrochemical potentials of diffusive metals using the quasiclassical green functions technique .",
    "the `` diffusive ferromagnetic metal '' is a metal in which spin splitting of the conduction band is small compared with the momentum relaxation rate for conduction electrons .",
    "let us consider that axis @xmath10 is perpendicular to the @xmath11 boundary , and neglect reversal of the electron spin upon transmission through the interface .",
    "then , for each of the metals equations for the green functions @xmath12 read @xcite : @xmath13 @xmath14 here @xmath15 ; @xmath16 $ ] is the single - particle quasiclassical green function symmetric ( antisymmetric ) with respect to a projection of the fermi momentum @xmath17 on the axis @xmath10 ; @xmath18 is a projection of the fermi velocity on the axis @xmath10 ; @xmath19 is a spin index , and @xmath20 is a coordinate in a plane of the contact .",
    "the bar above @xmath21 means integration over the solid angle : @xmath22 .",

    "boundary conditions ( [ eq3 ] ) , ( [ eq4 ] ) obey the specular reflection law : @xmath30 the angles @xmath31 in ( [ eq5 ] ) are measured from the axis @xmath10 , a range of variation for the biggest one is @xmath32 $ ] .",
    "the quasiclassical equations ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) , and the boundary conditions ( [ eq3 ] ) and ( [ eq4 ] ) are formulated for a single electron trajectory determined by the angles @xmath33 and @xmath34 .    upon solution of the system of equations ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) we shall consider that the ferromagnet is located to the left of the boundary @xmath35 , and the normal metal - to the right ( @xmath36 ) , and that the functions @xmath21 are homogeneous in the plane of the contact . then , the system of equations ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) can be solved in the form of integral equations for the functions @xmath37 and @xmath21 in the energy representation , @xmath38 : @xmath39 @xmath40 in a dirty metal the solid - angle averaged function @xmath41 obeys the diffusion equation with a decay length which is much longer than the mean free path @xmath42 .",

    "( [ eq6 ] ) and ( [ eq7 ] ) near point @xmath10 and take out from the integrals independent on @xmath44 terms . substituting the resulting expansions into the boundary condition ( [ eq4 ] ) we find : @xmath45 _ { x=0}.   \\label{eq8}\\ ] ] to formulate boundary conditions for the functions @xmath46 ( which are , in fact , chemical potentials - see below ) we use a matching procedure proposed in ref .",

    "now we calculate , for example , @xmath50 using the expression ( [ eq8 ] ) for @xmath51 .",

    "( [ eq5 ] ) . when deriving eq .",
    "( [ eq12 ] ) we have used conservation of the current density at the interface , which follows from eq .",

    "( [ eq12 ] ) can be expressed in terms of the density of current ( [ eq14 ] ) , and we find the spin - dependent resistance of the interface @xmath62 : @xmath63 @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the area of the contact .",
    "it follows from equation ( [ eq20 ] ) that , in the quasiclassical approach at specular reflection from the interface , the boundary resistance between ferromagnetic and normal metals is determined only by the fermi momenta of the contacting metals and coefficient of transmission through the interface .",
    "experimental data are given for the spin asymmetry of boundary resistance , @xmath2 , and for the renormalized resistance of the interface , @xmath66 , determined as follows : @xmath67 to calculate dependence of @xmath2 and @xmath66 on the fermi momentum of the non - magnetic metal for various values of the ferromagnet conduction band polarization we have used the fermi - momentum - mismatch model for the transmission coefficient : @xmath68 $ ] .",
    "results are presented in figures 1 ( @xmath69 ) , 2 ( @xmath70 ) and 3 ( @xmath71 ) . from our calculations",
    "it follows that for a non - magnetic metal with a low density of conduction electrons ( small value of the fermi momentum @xmath26 ) the spin asymmetry of the boundary resistance @xmath2 is always negative ( fig .",
    "1 ) . on the contrary , for a non - magnetic metal with a high density of conduction electrons the spin asymmetry of the boundary resistance is always positive ( fig .",
    "3 ) . in an intermediate situation",
    "@xmath8 can be negative as well as positive ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . to attain the maximum amplitude of negative magnetoresistance in @xmath11",
    "multilayers the spin asymmetry of the boundary resistance @xmath2 and the asymmetry of the bulk resistance @xmath3 should be both positive and close to unity . according to our calculations , the fermi momentum of the non - magnetic metal should be as far as possible close to the fermi momentum of the majority subband of ferromagnetic metal ( fig .",
    "2 , @xmath72 and fig .",
    "3 , @xmath73 ) .",
    "the spin asymmetry of the bulk resistance can be adjusted by the type and concentration of impurities in the ferromagnetic metal @xcite .",
    "clearly , similar arguments can be applied to the opposite case of negative values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , which will result in positive magnetoresistance in multilayers of alternating ferromagnetic and non - magnetic metals . however , a negative asymmetry of the bulk resistance is met less often @xcite .",
    "competition of opposite in a sign asymmetries of boundary and bulk resistances can result in negative or positive magnetoresistance depending on the choice of materials and thickness of the ferromagnetic layers @xcite .",
    "experiments on cpp transport in multilayers are very complicated because the resistance of a stack of layers of nanometer thickness is very small ( order of @xmath74 m@xmath75 ) .",
    "nevertheless , available experimental data ( see reviews @xcite and references in them , and also works @xcite ) allow to test the internal consistency of the theory .",
    "multilayers of the iron - group ferromagnetic metals with noble metals most likely belong to case 3 ( @xmath76 , and parameter of the spin asymmetry @xmath8 is positive @xcite .",
    "for example , @xmath77 @xcite . then , intersection of the horizontal dash line @xmath78 in the top field of fig .",
    "3 with the curve @xmath79 , corresponding to @xmath80 , gives @xmath81 . accepting @xmath82 as a trial value for the fermi momentum of the majority subband of cobalt we receive @xmath83 , which fits fairly good the free - electron - model value for copper , @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "there are data for silver as the non - magnetic spacer : @xmath85 @xcite . in a similar way",
    ", we obtain from fig .",
    "3 , @xmath86 , which fits well the free - electron - model value @xmath87 @xcite .    let us look now at consistency of the theory with boundary resistance data .",
    "for the combination @xmath88 , @xmath89 @xcite . continuing the vertical dash line for copper in fig . 3 into the bottom field till intersection with the curve @xmath90 ,",
    "corresponding to @xmath80 , we obtain @xmath91 .",
    "a similar procedure gives for silver @xmath92 ( compare with @xmath93 @xcite ) .",
    "it is worthy to notice that the theory reproduces fairly good closeness of the boundary resistances of the co / cu and co / ag interfaces .    for @xmath94 multilayers",
    "the asymmetry of the boundary resistance is negative , @xmath95 @xcite .",
    "this value is admissible for cases 1 ( fig.1 , top field ) and 2 ( fig .",
    "2 , top field ) . without details , we conclude that the first case does not match the expected value of the conduction band polarization parameter for co @xmath96 as well as results in about two orders in magnitude higher boundary resistance . the second case ( see dash lines in fig .",
    "2 ) results in a fermi momentum @xmath97 , and in a boundary resistance @xmath98 .",
    "the fermi momentum is satisfactory in the frame of the free electron model @xcite .",
    "the boundary resistance is close enough to the experimental value @xmath99 @xcite .",
    "we expect that better matching of the band structures of cobalt and chromium , both belonging to the iron - group metals , would results in a weaker influence of the real band structure on the boundary resistance .",
    "a discrepancy with experiment in an absolute value of boundary resistance of about 20 - 45% seems not catastrophic because of the following reasons .",
    "first , the trial choice of @xmath82 was not optimized .",
    "second , we used the free _",
    "s_-electron model as a background for the theory .",
    "one may expect that for an interface between a metal with predominantly _",
    "d_-electron conduction band ( iron group ) and an _ s_-electron metal ( cu , ag ) , reduced overlapping and symmetry mismatch may noticeably increase the boundary resistance .",
    "third , garca and stoll have shown ( fig . 2 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) that the interface roughness also increases boundary resistance .",
    "this increase is estimated below 20 - 60% for different models and magnitudes of the interface roughness , and reasonable differences in the fermi momenta of contacting metals .",
    "the interface roughness is much less important for the case of cpp transport , considered in this paper , than for current - in - plane ( cip ) transport @xcite .",
    "finally , spin - reversal at the interface opposes the both previously considered processes , decreasing the boundary resistance .",
    "the reversal of the electron spin by the spin - orbit interaction is always expected upon refraction of the electron wave or scattering on roughness at the interface between two metals .",
    "quantitative analysis of the competition between the above minor mechanisms of boundary resistance is beyond the scope of the paper .",
    "however , it is our expectation that the key quantity , spin asymmetry of the boundary resistance @xmath8 , is only weakly dependent on band structures matching , interface roughness , spin reversal _",
    "etc_. because of considerable cancellations in the dimensionless ratio , eq .",
    "( [ eq21 ] ) .",
    "our trial evaluations show that the experimental data for the spin asymmetry of boundary resistance and the absolute value of boundary resistance in @xmath88 , @xmath100 and @xmath94 multilayers can be consistently described with the use of the spin polarization parameter for the conduction band of cobalt @xmath101 . at the level of the experimental accuracy and completeness of the theory the estimated value of @xmath102 is identical to @xmath103 , which we have estimated @xcite from experiments of garca _ et al . _",
    "@xcite on magnetoresistance of cobalt nanocontacts .",
    "experiments on andreev spectroscopy cite similar values of @xmath102 for cobalt @xcite .",
    "thus , the spin asymmetry of the boundary resistance in combination with the absolute value of the boundary resistance can be used for estimations of the spin - polarization parameter @xmath104 of the conduction band of ferromagnetic metals .",
