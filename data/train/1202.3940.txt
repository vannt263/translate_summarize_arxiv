    "the restriction of @xmath30 to that space is an element of @xmath311 , namely , equal to @xmath312 .",
    "this is an isotropic vector relative to the bilinear form , and so is its complex conjugate @xmath313 .",
    "the linear map @xmath314 scaling @xmath315 with @xmath316 and @xmath287 with @xmath317 is an element of the orthogonal group .",
    "explicitly , this gives the one - parameter subgroup @xmath318 with the property that @xmath319 for all @xmath83 .",
    "we will now apply the one - parameter group criterion to an an important class of vertex models whose partition functions include the partition functions of so - called _ spin models _",
    "@xcite ) as was shown by b. szegedy in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath320 be distinct vectors in @xmath0 and let @xmath321 be nonzero elements of @xmath4 . then define @xmath322 for @xmath323 .",
    "this @xmath324 is a vertex model and we write @xmath325 for the restriction of @xmath30 to polynomials of degree at most @xmath81 .",
    "we have the following characterization .",
    "[ thm : spin ] the orbit @xmath326 is closed for sufficiently large @xmath81 if and only if the @xmath2-orbit of @xmath327 in @xmath328 is closed , and this happens if and only if the restriction of the bilinear form to the span of the @xmath329 is nondegenerate .    the second equivalence is well known , but we include an argument as a warm - up for the first equivalence .",
    "first , let @xmath330 be the span of the @xmath329 . if the restriction of the form to @xmath331 is degenerate , then we may choose a canonical basis @xmath295 of @xmath0 such that that @xmath331 is spanned by @xmath332 with @xmath333 ( in particular , @xmath334 then lies in the radical of the restriction of the form to @xmath331 ) .",
    "now let @xmath335 be the one - parameter group with @xmath336 for @xmath337 , @xmath338 for @xmath339 and @xmath340 for @xmath341 .",
    "then @xmath342 exists for all @xmath343 and lies in the span of @xmath344 , a proper subspace of @xmath331 . hence @xmath345 does not lie in the orbit of @xmath327 , and the latter orbit is not closed .",
    "for the converse , assume that the restriction of the form to @xmath331 is nondegenerate . by the one - parameter group criterion , to prove closedness of @xmath346 it suffices to prove that whenever @xmath304 is a one - parameter subgroup of @xmath2 for which the limit @xmath347 exists , that limit actually lies in the orbit of @xmath327 .",
    "now since the gram matrix of @xmath348 equals that of @xmath327 , and since its rank equals the dimension of @xmath331 , we find that the span @xmath349 of the @xmath350 is again a nondegenerate subspace of @xmath0 of the same dimension as @xmath331 .",
    "hence the stabilizers of @xmath327 and @xmath348 are the isomorphic groups @xmath351 and @xmath352 .",
    "in particular they have the same dimension .",
    "since orbits at the `` boundary '' of an orbit have strictly larger - dimensional point stabilizers , we conclude that @xmath348 is in the @xmath2-orbit of @xmath327 .",
    "now for the first part of the theorem , one direction is easy : if the orbit of @xmath327 is not closed , then there exists a one - parameter subgroup @xmath335 such that @xmath353 for @xmath354 and such that @xmath348 does not lie in the orbit of @xmath327 .",
    "then @xmath355 exists and maps any polynomial @xmath356 of degree at most @xmath81 to @xmath357 .",
    "it is not hard to see that for sufficiently large @xmath81 , the restriction @xmath358 is _ not _ in the orbit of @xmath325 , roughly because the set of points @xmath320 can be recovered from @xmath30 in an @xmath2-equivariant manner ( as the set of points defined by the largest ideal of @xmath10 contained in the kernel of @xmath30 ) , and then so can the @xmath359 by plugging in lagrange interpolation polynomials at the @xmath329 .    for",
    "the converse , assume that @xmath320 span a nondegenerate subspace @xmath331 of @xmath0 .",
    "we will prove that the orbit of @xmath325 is closed for @xmath360 .",
    "let @xmath335 be a one - parameter subgroup such that @xmath361 exists ; we will show that it lies in the orbit of @xmath325 .",
    "let @xmath295 be a canonical basis of @xmath0 with @xmath362 for weights @xmath298 .",
    "let @xmath363 be the basis of @xmath9 dual to @xmath295 .",
    "for any monomial @xmath364 we have @xmath365 by assumption , if @xmath366 is a monomial of degree at most @xmath81 , the limit for @xmath354 of this expression exists .",
    "if @xmath367 is negative , this means that @xmath368 must be zero . by taking linear combinations",
    ", this implies that for any polynomial @xmath356 of degree at most @xmath81 in which only monomials @xmath366 with @xmath369 appear , we have @xmath370 .    in",
    "what follows , we exclude the trivial cases where @xmath371 and where @xmath372 and @xmath373 is the zero vector ; in both of these cases , the orbit of @xmath30 is just a single point .",
    "next let @xmath374 be the maximal index with @xmath375 , and order the @xmath329 such that @xmath376 and @xmath377 .",
    "if @xmath378 is nonnegative , then all @xmath329 lie in the sum of the weight spaces with nonnegative weights , so that @xmath379 exists , and by the second equivalence we know that it lies in the orbit of @xmath327",
    ". then also @xmath325 and @xmath361 lie in the same orbit .",
    "hence we may assume that @xmath378 is negative ( in particular , @xmath380 is larger than @xmath381 ) .    by maximality of @xmath380 ,",
    "the coordinates @xmath382 vanish identically on @xmath331 , and this means that @xmath331 lies in the subspace of @xmath0 perpendicular to @xmath383 . since @xmath331 is nondegenerate , it does not contain a nonzero linear combination of @xmath383 .",
    "this means , in particular , that the coordinates @xmath384 together separate the points @xmath385 .",
    "then so do the monomials + @xmath386 .",
    "note that the dot product @xmath387 is negative for each of these ( e.g. , for the second , it equals @xmath388 and from there the dot product decreases weakly to the right ) .",
    "it follows that there exists a linear combination @xmath356 of those ( at most ) cubic monomials for which @xmath389 are distinct and nonzero .",
    "then , by the above , the vector @xmath390 is in the kernel of the vandermonde matrix @xmath391 since the degree of @xmath392 is @xmath393 . hence @xmath394 are all zero , contrary to the assumption that all @xmath359 are nonzero .",
    "this proves that the orbit of @xmath325 is closed for @xmath360 .",
    "if @xmath320 span @xmath0 , @xmath321 are non - zero elements of @xmath4 , and @xmath30 is defined as above , then for all @xmath51 the rank of @xmath395 equals @xmath396 , where @xmath99 is the finite group consisting of all orthogonal transformations of @xmath0 mapping each @xmath329 to some @xmath175 with @xmath397 equal to @xmath359 .",
