    "section [ qmsec ] provides a motivation for the study of mediated digraphs and the @xmath8th mediation number .",
    "( one is not required to read the section in order to understand the rest of the paper . ) in section [ lower ] , we obtain a lower bound @xmath11 for @xmath10 , which is proved to be sharp in the next two sections . section [ intersecting ] is devoted to a characterization of @xmath10 as an extremal parameter of special families of sets .",
    "this allows us to use some results from design theory .",

    "nonlocality is a fundamental , and curious , feature of quantum theory which confused einstein and continues to yield exciting results in physics ( there are numerous popular explanations of nonlocality , a more technical review is @xcite and in @xcite one can find some of the crucial early papers in the field ) .",
    "the study of nonlocality is sometimes helped by considering classical analogies : it was in this endeavor that mediated digraphs were discovered ( see @xcite - in that paper mediated digraphs are called totally paired graphs ) .",
    "consider two objects which are connected and then suddenly sent to such widely separated locations that they can no longer influence each other on relevant time scales .",
    "the results of local measurements on each member of a pair of classical objects , which have been connected and separated in this fashion , can be correlated , depending on their relationship when they were together . perhaps , when they were together , the objects exchanged some information , like a string of bits .",
    "the rough edges of a sheet of paper torn in two remain correlated when the pieces are sent to distantly separated locations : local measurements that are made on them are connected .",
    "the correlations between the results of certain sets of local measurements on some pairs of quantum objects , which have been connected and separated , can not be explained by allowing only an exchange of a bit string when they started together .",
    "if one studies the probability distributions of the different possible outcomes of local measurements on sets of quantum objects , for different local measurement settings , one can not explain them by common strings of information shared between the objects .",
    "this is an aspect of nonlocality .",
    "since it is the case that measurements on quantum objects can show classical correlations but the reverse is not true , there is a sense in which quantum objects have correlations beyond allowed classical ones .",
    "nonlocality has been well studied for pairs of quantum objects but less work has been undertaken for more than two @xcite .",
    "let @xmath32 be some object which can be measured in one of two ways but not both at once .",
    "for example , suppose we have an apparatus which measures either the height or the width of @xmath32 , but not the two together .",
    "let @xmath33 be the measurements of @xmath32 and let @xmath34 be possible outcomes of this measurement .",
    "it is natural to hold that the way that an object is measured affects the result of a measurement : @xmath35 ( an object with height ` 0 ' and width ` 1 ' will yield a result ` 1 ' when its width is measured and ` 0 ' otherwise ) .",
    "if the measurement events occur at space - like separated locations then the way that another object , @xmath36 , is measured elsewhere , @xmath37 , can not affect @xmath38 unless the objects are exchanging information faster than light : @xmath39 ( @xmath38 is unaltered for any value of @xmath37 ) .",
    "a standard classical analogy for quantum nonlocality is as follows ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "classical separated objects are allowed to cheat and exchange information , faster than light , about the way they are to be measured . in this case",
    "the outcomes of a measurement on the object @xmath32 could indeed depend on the way the object @xmath36 is measured : @xmath40 .",
    "the correlations present in sets of quantum objects can now be classically approximated .",
    "one can ask how many bits of information have to be exchanged between classical objects in order to fool an experimentalist into thinking he / she is measuring a quantum state .",
    "the classical objects are given an extra property ; their characteristics can depend on the way other , distant , objects are measured .",
    "how much of this freedom need one allow in order to produce scenarios which can have the same measurement results as measurements of quantum objects ?    in the scenario considered in @xcite ( motivated by the structure of probability spaces ) each object ( a vertex ) knows how it is to be measured and can send this information to other vertices ( an arc from source vertex to target vertex ) .",
    "this information stays put on receipt and does not propagate around the graph : a vertex can only know the way another vertex is to be measured by receiving an arc directly from that vertex ( not via a third party ) .",
    "the measurement results of vertices , given that their properties might now depend on the way their neighbors are to be measured , are more general and now have a chance to reproduce quantum correlations .",
    "it was shown that it is necessary that the vertices be connected as a mediated digraph if they are to fool an experimentalist into thinking he / she is measuring a quantum state . within this model , a certain topology of communication is a necessary classical property in order to simulate sets of quantum objects classically .",
    "note that sufficiency was not shown and this is now being studied ( these digraphs are patterns of faster than light communication - however this violation of causality is not necessary and can be removed by a randomization procedure @xcite theorem 3 ) .",
    "given that @xmath8 classical objects connected as any mediated digraph can sometimes be at least as nonlocal as @xmath8 quantum mechanical objects , it is interesting to find out how connected these digraphs are .",
    "if the digraphs are good analogues of quantum nonlocality , then their structure should inform us about quantum correlations .",
    "one would like to consider the least connected members of the set of mediated digraphs - the least connected digraphs that can still be at least as nonlocal as quantum states . in order to achieve",
    "this one must have a good measure of connectivity : we consider @xmath25 if an @xmath8 vertex digraph contains a vertex which depends on the settings of lots of other vertices , @xmath7 will be large : this defines a highly nonlocal pattern - one vertex is highly correlated with many others . if all vertices in a digraph are only connected to a few others , @xmath7 will be small : such digraphs seem to have a form of short range nonlocality .",
    "proving that , for any @xmath8 , there are mediated digraphs which have @xmath7 scaling with @xmath41 ( theorem [ o(1)th ] of this paper ) , shows that each object need only be connected to a fraction of the set of objects which _ diminishes _ as @xmath8 increases ( as @xmath42 ) .",
    "as @xmath8 increases there exist mediated digraphs in which each vertex becomes increasingly localized with respect to the whole - this must be telling us something about quantum nonlocality .",
    "for a real @xmath20 , let @xmath43 denote the least integer not smaller than @xmath44 let @xmath45 the following proposition gives a lower bound for @xmath10 , which is the exact value of @xmath10 for infinitely many values of @xmath8 ( see corollaries [ muproj ] and [ projth ] ) .",

    "let @xmath49 be the in - degrees of vertices @xmath50 of @xmath2 .",
