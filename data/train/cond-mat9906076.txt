    "the concept of replica symmetry breaking ( rsb ) as a crucial tool in the study of spin glass systems has been introduced close to twenty years ago , and a successful ansatz for the breaking pattern has been proposed @xcite .",
    "nowadays there are no doubts that it describes correctly what happens in infinite range models @xcite . on the contrary",
    "its correctness in the case of short range models has remained controversial . for short range models we can not exhibit a solution in closed form , and things",
    "are made more difficult from the fact that the picture that emerges from the rsb is substantially different from the usual scenario valid for normal ferromagnets , with which we are familiar .",
    "moreover we have to deal with rather complex theoretical predictions , that can be interpreted in a simpler way by recasting them as the claim of the existence of an extremely large number of pure states ( or phases ) for very large systems . however",
    "this notion of many equilibrium states ( not related by a trivial symmetry ) is rather counterintuitive in the case of spin glasses ( since it is difficult to visualize the situation in a fruitful way ) while it would be quite natural in other contexts .",
    "for example the picture is clear in the case of protein folding , where a different equilibrium state corresponds to a different folding ( tertiary structure ) of the protein .",
    "such intrinsic novelty and unusual character of the rsb formalism ( and maybe some lack of precision in the mathematical definitions of some of the relevant literature @xcite ) has led to some degree of controversy on the precise definition and meaning of rsb and on its range of validity @xcite ( for the possible application of the migdal - kadanoff approximation , mka , to spin glass systems , see @xcite : it is interesting to notice that gardner @xcite has shown that it fails already at the mean field level ) .    in this paper",
    "we try to bring a positive contribution to the discussion by stating in the most clear and complete way which are the predictions implied by a rsb scenario , and summarizing the quite ample numerical evidence for its validity in finite dimensional systems .",
    "this paper integrates and supplements the review @xcite ( for relevant books and reviews see @xcite ) . in order not to mix different conceptual issues we will first state the rsb predictions without using the concept of finite volume pure state .",
    "however this concept will be used later , when discussing the physical interpretation of the ansatz .",
    "we will also discuss the relation among the finite volume pure states and the infinite volume ones .",
    "we will analyze the two cases of the infinite range model and of short range one .",
    "we will discuss the problem of the number of _ phases _ for a finite system in the infinite volume limit and for an actual infinite system ( these are two related but _ different _ problems ) . in doing that one should distinguish clearly the predictions coming from rsb from their consequences on the equilibrium states of the system .",
    "we will also discuss in detail the available numerical evidence .",
    "we will present new data which should help in clarifying the situation further .",
    "the first steps are quite simple .",
    "we consider a system of @xmath0 spins whose hamiltonian depends on some quenched random couplings @xmath1 . in order to avoid all the complications present in the definition of the boltzmann - gibbs distribution for an actual infinite volume system ( see section ( [ infinite ] ) )",
    "we follow the traditional approach of defining a probability distribution of the configuration @xmath2 as @xmath3 for a finite volume system .",
    "it is evident that as it stands this definition can not be used naively for an actual infinite system , since the exponent would be always infinite .",
    "a more careful treatment is needed .    for definiteness we shall consider two different models :    * a long range model , i.e. the sk model @xcite with hamiltonian + @xmath4 + where @xmath5 , the first sum is over all couples of sites of the lattice and the second one over all sites .",
    "the couplings @xmath1 are quenched random variables with zero expectation value and for a system with @xmath0 sites @xmath6 ( we denote by brackets the thermal average and by an upper bar the averages over the quenched disorder ) . * a short range model , i.e. the ea model @xcite with hamiltonian : + @xmath7 + where now the primed sum runs over couples of first neighboring sites , and @xmath8 .    in order to study the average over the couplings @xmath1 of the free energy and of the correlation functions it is useful to consider a system where the spin configurations are replicated @xmath9 times ( in the same realization of the random interaction ) , with hamiltonian    @xmath10    after integration over the @xmath1 one arrives to a new hamiltonian in which different replicas are coupled . in order to study the model",
    "it is convenient to introduce the quantity    @xmath11    where @xmath12 and @xmath13 characterize two of the different replicas that we have introduced , and @xmath0 is the number of spins per configuration .",
    "we follow here a standard procedure ( used in statistical mechanics and field theory in the last @xmath14 years @xcite ) : we first derive a mean field approximation , in which some kind of fluctuations are neglected ( for a ferromagnet we would get the equation @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the magnetization , @xmath17 is the coordination number of the lattice and @xmath1 does not depend on the site ) . at a second stage",
    "we deduce the correlation from the mean field approximation , obtaining the equivalent of the ornstein - zernike ( oz ) expression for the correlation functions . in a third stage , which even for ferromagnets is relatively recent ,",
    "we compute systematically the corrections to the mean field approximation and ( when this is possible ) we use the renormalization group to sum them up . in the case of spin glasses",
    "this last stage is still lacking , so that we are going to discuss only the mean field predictions with the computation of oz correlations .    in the mean field approximation ( i.e. when we neglect fluctuations ) we find a free energy @xmath18 $ ] , where @xmath19 .",
    "it is usually assumed ( and it can be proved for @xmath20 ) that the value of @xmath21 can be found by solving the equation    @xmath22    under the condition that all the eigenvalues of the hessian    @xmath23    are non negative .",
    "the real problem arises when the saddle point equations admit more than one solution , and these solutions are related by a symmetry .",
    "this phenomenon is well known ( it was discovered by archimedes a long time ago ) , and in the context of statistical mechanics it goes under the name of _ symmetry breaking_. in this particular case the obvious symmetry is the permutation of different replicas .",
    "this symmetry is broken as soon as the non - diagonal elements of @xmath24 depend on @xmath12 and @xmath13 . in this case",
    "the usual prescription is to average over all the different solutions of the saddle point equations in replica space ( which being related by a symmetry have exactly the same free energy ) .",
    "therefore if the value of an observable @xmath25 depends on @xmath21 we find that    @xmath26    where the sum runs over the @xmath27 permutations ( @xmath28 ) of @xmath9 elements .",
    "if we apply this procedure to the correlation functions we find that @xcite    @xmath29    the previous equation can also be written as    @xmath30    where    @xmath31    and @xmath32 is the probability that two configurations selected according to the boltzmann - gibbs ( b - g ) distribution are such that their overlap ( [ e - overlap ] ) is equal to @xmath33",
    ".    the properties of the systems are related to those of the matrix @xmath24 . at first view the introduction of this matrix",
    "could appear a strange step .",
    "it has been shown however that it represents a compact way to encode the probability distribution of the overlaps among an arbitrary number of equilibrium configurations , and to describe how this probability changes when we change the couplings @xmath1 .",
    "the form of the matrix @xmath21 is crucial . in the replica approach we are forced by stability considerations ( see section [ s - stosta ] on stochastic stability ) to consider matrices in which every line is a permutation of the other lines .",
    "the consequences of this form of the matrix @xmath21 , or equivalently of _ stochastic stability _ , will be discussed in the rest of this paper .",
    "there are some extra predictions which come from more specific assumptions about the form of the matrix @xmath21 .",
    "for example if we also assume ultrametricity we will refer to them as the _ mean field",
    "predictions_. indeed in the mean field approximation one finds that the matrix @xmath21 which makes the mean field free energy stationary is ultrametric .",
    "when we will meet a prediction which depends on the specific form of the matrix @xmath21 we will note it explicitly .    if the function @xmath32 is trivial , i.e. if    @xmath34    independently on the coupling @xmath1 ( as it happens in ferromagnets ) , the use of the replica method would be not interesting is broken .",
    "if this is not true the function @xmath35 is be symmetric under the transformation @xmath36 .",
    "usually , even in a ferromagnet , in the cold phase the function @xmath35 is not continuous at @xmath37 : its value at @xmath37 is different from the limits @xmath38 . ] .",
    "if the function @xmath35 is non - trivial we say that _ replica symmetry is broken_.    it is convenient to introduce the function @xmath39    @xmath40    where we assume that the function @xmath35 has support for positive values of @xmath33 .",
    "we define a function @xmath41 as the inverse of @xmath39 .",
    "of course @xmath41 is defined only in the interval @xmath42 .",
    "we thus have    @xmath43    it is clear that the correlation functions are not clustering unless the function @xmath41 is constant , i.e. ( see ( [ e - qea ] ) ) @xmath44 ( this is needed so that in a translational invariant system intensive quantities do not fluctuate in the infinite volume limit and to make all connected correlation functions vanishing at large distance ) : for clustering systems the function @xmath35 must be equal to @xmath45 .",
    "the replica formalism also allows to study the dependence of the function @xmath32 over the overlap @xmath33 . under general assumptions",
    "one finds @xcite that universal relations like    @xmath46    hold ( @xmath47 and @xmath48 are two given values of @xmath33 ) .",
    "a set of relations of this type has been proven under general hypothesis ( i.e. stochastic stability ) in @xcite and in @xcite .    in the most popular scheme for replica symmetry breaking @xcite , which is supposed to be correct for the infinite range sherrington kirkpatrick ( sk ) model , given any function function @xmath41 ( where @xmath49 goes from @xmath50 to @xmath51 ) in the limit @xmath52 we can find a matrix @xmath24 such that the previous equations are satisfied .    in the infinite volume limit the typical form of the function @xmath41 is such that ( at least in the mean field approximation )    @xmath53    where the function @xmath54 is smooth is discontinuous in the limit of zero magnetic field . ] .    some further relations which are not necessarily valid on general grounds turn out to hold in the rsb ansatz , that is verified in the solution of the mean field theory of spin glasses : the most popular one is the ultrametric relation @xcite , which states that the overlap distribution of three overlaps ( @xmath55 ) among three replicas ( @xmath51 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 ) in the same realization of the quenched disorder is zero as soon as the ultrametricity inequality    @xmath58    ( or one of the two other permutations of the former relation ) is violated .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that these inequalities ( plus the general conditions which come from stochastic stability ) imply that the average probability distribution of three overlaps is given by :    @xmath59 \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    moreover all the probability distributions of more that three overlaps and their variation from system to system are completely determined by the function @xmath35 , or equivalently by the function @xmath41 . in other words the usual replica symmetry breaking of mean",
    "field theory is the only possible pattern of replica symmetry breaking that is ultrametric .    in principle",
    "it is possible that ultrametricity is valid in the infinite range model and it is violated in finite dimensional short range models , the function @xmath35 remaining non - trivial and consequently replica symmetry being still broken . in this case",
    "one would have to consider , in the short range models , more complex forms of the matrix @xmath21 .",
    "indications that this does not happen and that ultrametricity will hold in finite dimensional models will be discussed later .",
    "summarizing we are considering three possibilities    * the function @xmath35 is a single delta function at @xmath60 , and @xmath61 is non - zero below the critical temperature .",
    "this situation , with no breaking of the replica symmetry , is realized in the migdal kadanoff approximation or equivalently in the droplet model . *",
    "the @xmath35 is a not a single delta function : in this case replica symmetry is broken .",
    "the condition of replica equivalence strongly constrains the behavior of the system .",
    "* the ultrametricity condition is satisfied .",
    "this is the mean field case , where many more detailed predictions can be obtained .",
    "we have already commented on the fact that a non trivial form of the function @xmath35 implies that the correlation functions are non - clustering . in this case",
    "the study of the correlation functions can be involved , since we can select different values of the overlap . in all generality",
    "we can try to determine correlations of @xmath62 operators at different fixed overlap @xmath63 . here",
    "we will focus only on the simplest kind of such correlation functions .    as before we consider two copies of the system in the same realization of the disorder , and we denote their spin variables by @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "we define the local overlap on the site @xmath66 by    @xmath67    which can take the values @xmath68 .",
    "we define the average @xmath69 , restricted to the configurations of the system such that    @xmath70    we define now a ( non - connected ) correlation function    @xmath71    where we are considering systems with @xmath0 spins .",
    "these @xmath72 dependent correlation functions can be computed in the replica formalism by using the analogue of the oz formulae .",
    "we consider the case , relevant for spin glasses , where the function @xmath73 of ( [ e - duedel ] ) is non - zero and @xmath74 ( i.e. @xmath75 is in the support of @xmath35 ) . in the usual ansatz for replica symmetry",
    "one finds that @xcite    @xmath76    therefore for all @xmath74 @xmath77 connected correlation functions at fixed @xmath33 value satisfy the usual cluster decomposition .",
    "the total free energy of the constrained system ( with fixed @xmath75 ) is ( apart from corrections of order one ) equal to the unconstrained free energy because @xmath78 .",
    "a behavior of this type is unusual , and we will discuss it in better detail in the next sections",
    ". one can think about a similar construction in a ferromagnet : in that case when forcing a value of the magnetization smaller than the spontaneous magnetization one would create a situation where the correlation function of the magnetization would not be clustering ( there would be at least an interface ) .",
    "what is happening here is that for each value of the overlap @xmath72 that we can select we find a different asymptotic limit for the value of the correlation functions .",
    "the approach of these correlation functions to their large distance asymptotic value is very interesting : in mean field using the oz approximation one finds that for large @xmath66    @xmath79    the exponent ( which is a non trivial function of @xmath80 ) is known only at zero loops in the mean field approximation @xcite .",
    "it is an extremely important and open question to verify if its value is correct beyond tree level .",
    "we can distinguish three cases :    * @xmath81 .",
    "there is a feeling that this result may be exact , and that it corresponds to some kind of goldstone theorem ( see @xcite and references therein , and @xcite ) .",
    "* @xmath82 for @xmath83 ( where the last equivalence holds only for @xmath84 different from @xmath50 ) .",
    "there is a feeling that this result may be modified by corrections to the mean field approximation @xcite , although there is no final evidence of this effect . on the contrary , if the exponent would be exact even in three dimensions , one should conclude that replica symmetry breaking disappears in @xmath85 , and @xmath57 should be identified as the lower critical dimension ( but for the existence of a phase transition in @xmath86 see @xcite ) . * @xmath87 for @xmath88 ( i.e. only in zero magnetic field ) .",
    "this result does not apply in @xmath89 .",
    "the following formula has been conjectured ( see @xcite and references therein ) : + @xmath90 + where @xmath91 is the exponent @xmath92 for the @xmath77 correlations at the critical point .    a phenomenon which is related to this behavior of the correlation functions is the non - triviality of the window overlap distributions .",
    "let us consider the case of @xmath57 dimensions .",
    "we select a cubic region @xmath93 of @xmath94 spins in the center of our system ( of @xmath0 spins ) and we define the _ window overlap _",
    "@xmath95    we can define the probability distribution    @xmath96    where @xmath97 is the probability distribution of @xmath98 in a system with @xmath0 spins . the prediction of the replica approach is then that @xmath99 is non trivial .",
    "one finds that    @xmath100    if we define the restricted probability distributions @xmath101",
    ", i.e. we consider only those pairs of configurations with a fixed value of the overlap @xmath72 , we find that    @xmath102    where the rate of the approach to the asymptotic limit is controlled by the appropriate exponent @xmath103 that we have just discussed .    in other words",
    "if we fix the value of the total overlap we expect that the average overlap in each large region will become equal to the global overlap .",
    "this mean that without paying any price in free energy density we can change the average value of the overlap in each region of the space .",
    "this in sharp contrast with what would happen in a ferromagnet , where locally the system would remain in the phase of positive or negative magnetization .",
    "the results shown in the previous sections are the main predictions of the rsb ansatz .",
    "broken replica theory predicts that for realistic spin glasses the function @xmath35 is non trivial not because of the presence of interfaces among two different phases , which are located in random position . in order to stress this point and to clarify the implications of these predictions",
    "we will discuss now a negative example : we will examine a very simple physical system with a non - trivial @xmath35 which * does not * satisfy these predictions , and we will show how rsb theory is adamant in differentiating this case .    the system is simple : we consider a three dimensional ferromagnet that in the infinite volume limit develops a non - zero spontaneous magnetization @xmath16 ( i.e. with @xmath104 ) . for sake of simplicity",
    "we also suppose that the temperature is sufficiently small that the interface among the positive and negative magnetized phases is not rough .",
    "we also consider a finite volume realization of the system in a cubic box of @xmath0 spins with periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath105 and @xmath17 direction and antiperiodic boundary conditions in the @xmath49 direction . at a sufficiently low temperature",
    "the antiperiodic boundary conditions force the formation of a domain wall .",
    "for very large volumes @xmath0 we can classify the equilibrium configurations by the magnetization profile    @xmath106    that will be of the form    @xmath107    where @xmath108 is the position of the interface , and the function @xmath109 characterizes the profile . if @xmath110 takes integer values from @xmath51 to @xmath111 , @xmath109 is or @xmath112 for @xmath113 and @xmath114 for @xmath115 or it is @xmath114 for @xmath113 and @xmath112 for @xmath115 and it satisfies @xmath116 .",
    "this will be true for almost all equilibrium configurations , with exceptional configurations whose probability goes to zero when @xmath0 goes to infinity . if we now consider two generic equilibrium configurations a trivial computation shows that in the limit @xmath117 @xmath118 for @xmath119 .",
    "apart from the absence of fluctuation of @xmath120 with @xmath1 ( this system is not a random system ) the results for the correlation are different from the prediction of the rsb ansatz .",
    "the fact that in each configuration there is a single domain wall implies that    @xmath121    because if we look to a local observable we have zero probability of hitting an interface . in this example",
    "the window overlaps are insensitive to the boundary conditions .    with the same token we get that here    @xmath122    in other words in this case",
    "the system may exist in two different phases separated by an interface .",
    "the arbitrariness in the position of the interface implies a non trivial form of the function @xmath35 .",
    "however local quantities are insensitive to the presence of an interface and the replica predictions are not valid .",
    "this situation is not described by replica symmetry breaking , and a study of the relevant quantities makes it clear .    if we add a random term to the hamiltonian , for example a random dilution , it is possible to create a situation where the interface will be pinned in one single position . in this case",
    "the function @xmath35 will become a single trivial delta function . if we allow to the interface two or more positions we will obtain again a non trivial function @xmath35 .",
    "the local overlaps are insensitive to all these variations . in the two cases that we have described where the function @xmath35 is non - trivial ( an infinite number of positions or few positions allowed to the interface ) the relation ( [ guerel ] ) is not satisfied ( unless some magic coincidence happens in the last case , where the interface may be located in a few selected positions ) .",
    "an alternative way to understand how much the predictions of the rsb ansatz differ from the situation described in the previous section ( i.e. where there are two or more different phases related by a symmetry separated by an interface ) is considering different kinds of overlaps among spin configurations , in particular the energy overlap .    generally speaking , given a local quantity$ ] is a continuous function of @xmath123 in the usual product topology . ]",

    "the crucial point is that in the infinite volume limit the interfaces have vanishing weight .",
    "if the bulk of the system is in two or more different phases related by a symmetry , away from the interface the contribution to the energy overlap is constant . in this way",
    "one sees that in this case in the infinite volume limit the probability distribution of @xmath129 becomes a delta function .    on the contrary",
    "when replica symmetry is broken the probability distribution of @xmath129 remains non trivial also in the infinite volume limit . in the sk model",

    "this linear relation may approximately hold also in finite dimensional systems , but there are no reasons why it should remain exact . at least in the mean field approximation",
    "all possible types of overlaps are functions of the basic overlap @xmath33 , so that their probability distribution can be computed by evaluating the function @xmath35 and the relation among the generalized overlap and the basic overlap @xmath33 .",

    "it coincides with an energy overlap where the sum is done over the sites and not over the links .",
    "the link overlap is clearly sensitive to differences in the correlation functions of the two configurations .",

    "in order to develop a formalism useful to discuss the physical meaning of the results contained in the previous section it is convenient to introduce the concept of _ pure states in a finite volume_. this concept is crystal clear from a physical point of view . however it can be difficult to state it in a rigorous way ( i.e to prove existence theorems ) mostly because the notion of finite volume pure states ( or phases ) is deeply conditioned by the physical properties of the system under consideration . in order to prove theorems on finite volume pure states",
    "one needs a very strong rigorous command of the physical properties of finite , large statistical system .",
    "most of the research in mathematical physics has been devoted to the study of the pure states of an infinite system .",
    "unfortunately the concept of pure states of an infinite system is too rigid to capture all the statistical properties of a finite system and it is not relevant for the physical interpretation of the replica predictions : here we need , as we will see later , more sophisticated tools , that are exactly finite volume pure states .",
    "readers who are not interested to enter the details of this interpretation of the physical picture of rsb may skip this section and base their considerations on the results discussed in the previous chapter . those who decide to read this section should be aware that the finite volume pure states we introduce here are mathematically different from the pure states for an infinite system which are normally used in the literature .",

    "we require that the restricted averages on these regions are such that connected correlation functions are small which goes to zero when @xmath49 goes to infinity and require that the connected correlation functions evaluated in a given phase are smaller than @xmath139 .",

    "moreover all numerical simulations gather data that are based on these kinds of notions , since the systems that we can store in a computer are always finite .",
    "the concept of finite volume states is preeminent from the physical point of view : infinite volume states are mainly an attempt to capture their properties in an amenable mathematical setting .",
    "we strongly believe that this decomposition of a finite but large system into phases does make sense , although its translation in a rigorous mathematical setting has not been done ( also because it is much simpler , and in most cases informative enough , to work directly in the infinite volume setting ) .    in order to present an interpretation of these results",
    "we assume that such decomposition exists also for spin glasses ( the contrary would be very surprising for any system with a short range hamiltonian ) .",

    "we want to note that the definition of state is reminiscent of the definition of species which is familiar to biologists .",
    "states can also be discussed from a slightly different point of view , that we analyze now .",

    "we then ask ourselves if intensive quantities fluctuate in the infinite volume limit .",
    "in general we would expect a negative answer , since intensive quantities are averages over the whole system .",
    "this is not the case at a first order transition point , where different phases coexist .    as we have discussed before in the usual case of a ferromagnet ( in the broken phase ) spin configurations",

    "the decomposition of a probability distribution under which intensive quantities fluctuate into the linear combination of restricted probability distributions where the intensive quantities do not fluctuate works in many physical situations .",

    "this amounts to say that the dlr relations which tell us that the distribution probability is locally a boltzmann - gibbs distribution will be violated , but the violation will go to zero in the large volume limit .",
    "it is interesting to note that in usual situations in statistical mechanics the classification in phases is not very rich . for usual materials , in the generic case , there is only one phase : such a classification is not very interesting . in slightly more interesting cases ( usual symmetry breaking )",

    "for example , if we consider the configurations of a large number of water molecules at zero degrees , we can classify them as water or ice : here there are two states . in slightly more complex cases , if we tune carefully a few external parameters like the pressure or the magnetic field , we may have coexistence of three or more phases ( a tricritical or multicritical point ) .    in all these cases the classification is simple and",
    "the number of states is small . on the contrary in the mean field theory of spin",
    "glasses the number of states is very large ( it goes to infinity with @xmath0 ) , and a very interesting nested classification of states is possible .",

    "stochastic stability is a property which is valid in the mean field approximation : it is reasonable to conjecture that is valid in general also for short range models .",
    "it has been introduced quite recently @xcite and strong progresses have been done on the study of its consequences .    in order to decide",
    "if a system with hamiltonian @xmath311 is stochastically stable , we have to consider the free energy of an auxiliary system with the following hamiltonian :    @xmath312    if the average ( with respect to @xmath313 ) free energy is a differentiable function of @xmath223 ( and the limit where the volume goes to infinity commutes with the derivative with respect to @xmath223 ) , for a generic choice of the random perturbation @xmath313 inside a given class and @xmath223 close to zero , the system is said to be _ stochastically stable_. in the nutshell stochastic stability tells us that the hamiltonian @xmath311 does not has any special features and that its properties are analogous to those of similar random systems ( @xmath311 can contain quenched random disorder ) .",
    "it is simpler to compute the properties of the stochastically perturbed system than those of the original system , since any possible accidental symmetry is washed out by the random perturbation .",
    "for example spin glasses at exactly zero field are not stochastically stable because of the symmetry @xmath314 which is destroyed by a random perturbation .",
    "stochastic stability may hold only for spin glasses in presence of a non - zero magnetic field .",
    "the definition of stochastic stability may depend on the class of random perturbations we consider .",
    "quite often it is convenient to chose as a random perturbation an infinite range hamiltonian , e.g.    @xmath315    where the sum runs over all the @xmath0 sites of the system and the @xmath1 s are random uncorrelated variables with variance @xmath215 . in the same way we can define a random perturbation @xmath316 where the interaction involves @xmath219 spins .",
    "a simple integration by part tells us that in finite volume    @xmath317    where @xmath318 is the average over the random perturbation of the overlap distribution probability . adding terms with different values of @xmath219 we can reconstruct the whole function @xmath35 .",
    "the quantity @xmath319 is a well defined thermodynamic quantity like the internal energy , whose expectation value may be ambiguous only at exceptional points of first order phase transitions .",
    "it can also be obtained as the derivative of the @xmath223 dependent free energy .",
    "stochastic stability is a very strong property .",
    "many properties can be derived from stochastic stability , in particular the overlap sum rules ( [ guerel ] ) and their generalizations . let us discuss a few examples which should help to understand some implications of stochastic stability .",
    "* let us consider two different systems with two different non - trivial functions @xmath320 and @xmath321 , and let us suppose that each of the systems is stochastically stable .",
    "the union of the two systems , if they are non interacting , will not be stochastically stable anymore , as can be easily seen : the relation ( [ guerel ] ) is no more valid for the union system .",
    "stochastic stability describes a situation in which the whole system remains strongly correlated , as opposed to the one in which the function @xmath35 is non trivial because of the formation of interfaces among two possible phases .",
    "* when the overlap may only take two values , or equivalently the function @xmath35 is simply given by + @xmath322 + stochastic stability implies that the usual mean field ansatz gives the correct result .",
    "* the identity among the dynamic @xmath323 function and the static @xmath39 function can be proved to be a consequence of stochastic stability @xcite .",
    "we have seen that stochastic stability strongly constrains the properties of the system , and that many of the qualitative results of the replica approach can be derived as mere consequences of stochastic stability .",
    "stochastic stability apparently does not imply ultrametricity , which seems to be an independent property @xcite .",
    "this independence problem is still open as far as the only probabilities distribution of the free energies of the states that have been constructed in an explicit form are ultrametric .",
    "the free energy is a very basic quantity to analyze when studying the infinite volume limit of a physical system . in many cases it is easy to prove ( at least for the lattice model ) the existence of the free energy in the infinite volume limit . at first sight that could seem to be enough for deriving the thermodynamics and for computing intensive quantities , by derivating the free energy with respect to the external field .",
    "however when we consider the free energy as a function of some parameter we can find out that there are points where it is not differentiable , more precisely where the left and the right derivatives do differ .",
    "the typical example is the case of the spontaneous magnetization where    @xmath324    in this case we can obtain different values of the magnetization by considering the two limits @xmath325 .",
    "the same hamiltonian ( with zero magnetic field ) could give different result for the magnetization in the limit @xmath151 and @xmath326 . in this way",
    "we say that we end up in one of two different allowed states of the infinite volume system .",
    "a crucial reason for the direct introduction of pure states for an infinite volume system is to make life simpler , giving an intrinsic definition of pure states , avoiding the necessity of considering the response of the system all possible forms of the external fields .",
    "we will try to clarify here the language we need in order to proceed further , and we will give a few needed mathematical definitions .    the word _ state _ is often used in mathematics , with different underlying meanings .",
    "a possible definition is the following .",
    "let @xmath327 be the @xmath328 algebra of observables , which in classical statistical mechanics form an abelian algebra with identity .",
    "we say that a linear functional @xmath329 is a state if    @xmath330    where this second condition ( the norm of @xmath329 is one ) implies that @xmath331 .    in a finite volume",
    "a state is a normalized probability distribution : we can associate to it an expectation value .",
    "the notion of a state can be extended to an infinite system .",
    "if a compact set of states is convex , we can consider the extremal points of this set and call them _",
    "pure states_. any state of the set can be written in an unique way as a linear combination of these pure states .",
    "the introduction of the notion of pure states in statistical physics has the main goal , as we said before , to allow a clear definition of symmetry breaking .",
    "a crucial notion is the one of _ clustering _ :",
    "a state is called clustering if connected correlation functions computed in such state go to zero at large distance .",
    "there exist systems for which the finite volume equilibrium state goes to an infinite volume one with the unwanted property that its correlation functions do not satisfy the clustering properties ( consider for example a ferromagnetic system at zero external magnetic field in the low temperature region , where there is a spontaneous magnetization : in a typical situation volume @xmath0 will have a magnetization plus with probability @xmath332 or minus with probability @xmath332 , volume @xmath204 again a magnetization plus or minus and so on . the infinite volume limit of these pure states will be a statistical mixture of the plus and the minus states ) .",
    "physical consistency requires that if a system is in a given phase intensive quantities do not fluctuate , that is possible only if correlation functions are clustering .    for a class of models ( i.e. models without quenched disorder with translational invariant hamiltonians )",
    "it has been established that , if translational invariance is not spontaneously broken , the equilibrium state obtained as the infinite volume limit of finite volume states can be decomposed in an unique way as the convex combination of translational invariant states , in which the clustering property is satisfied .",
    "this is a remarkable result .",
    "this procedure has been generalized by introducing local equilibrium states ( dlr states @xcite ) for an infinite system with short range hamiltonian .",
    "a dlr state satisfies all the identities on conditional probabilities that would be valid for a boltzmann - gibbs state and involve only a finite number of variable .",
    "the dlr states form a convex set and their extremal points are clustering pure states . to find the structure of all extremal clustering infinite volume states for a given system is a non trivial task , which has been solved only in a few cases ( typically for a ferromagnetic model ) .",
    "this formalism in principle would allow to write formulae of the kind    @xmath333    where @xmath334 is the infinite volume limit of the boltzmann - gibbs probability distribution defined for finite volume , and @xmath138 labels the extremal dlr states .",
    "the sum must be replaced by an integral if the dlr states are not a numerable set .",
    "of course we are assuming the far from evident existence of @xmath334 .",
    "the proofs which are needed are very simple if one uses the appropriate mathematical setting @xcite .",
    "hard problems start when one has to show that this construction is not empty , i.e. when one has to prove that local equilibrium states do exist for the infinite system .",
    "the simplest way to do that is to consider a finite volume system and to show that the infinite volume limit of the boltzmann - gibbs probability exists . in this construction",
    "there is the freedom to chose the boundary conditions of the system , that could lead to different local equilibrium states .",
    "if the boundary conditions are chosen in an appropriate way ( e.g. all spins up in a ferromagnet ) one obtains a pure state .",
    "unfortunately such a procedure can be carried out only in a very few cases : in general when the volume goes to infinity the boltzmann - gibbs probability does not have a limit , contrary to what we could naively think ( we give a simple example of such a system in section ( [ ss - naive ] ) ) .",
    "the proof of the existence of the free energy density in the infinite volume limit for short range lattice systems is quite simple in the case of non random systems and not too complex for disordered systems .",
    "the crucial point in the proof is that we can modify the total hamiltonian without changing the free energy density by adding a contribution which diverges with the volume , but diverges with a slower rate than the volume itself .",
    "it is intuitive that in the infinite volume limit the free energy density can not depend by any boundary effect ( the surface to volume ratio goes to zero ) . on the contrary",
    "when we try to control the expectation values over the probability distribution we find that a change in total hamiltonian of a quantity of order @xmath51 may completely change the result .",
    "the nature and the number of the states of the infinite system is a crucial issue . a priori the rsb ansatz",
    "does not give an answer , that can turn out to be different for different systems : detailed computations and the analysis of theoretical ideas are needed to understand what exactly happens .",
    "one has to consider @xmath57 main possibilities : first the number of states can be finite , second it can be infinite with states forming a countable set , and as a third possibility the states can form an uncountable set .",
    "the rsb ansatz applied to the theory of spin glasses turns out to imply that the number of finite volume states of a system becomes infinite in the infinite volume limit .",
    "that implies that the second or the third case hold .",
    "a detailed computation ( see section ( [ ss - meta ] ) ) shows that the third possibility is the correct one .",
    "in the following we will also need to define a _ cesro average _",
    "( on which the metastate @xcite construction is based ) .",
    "we consider a ( reasonable enough ) function @xmath335 defined on a lattice of volume @xmath0 and define its cesro average as    @xmath336      we will give now an example of a situation where the b - g distribution does not have a limit when the volume diverges .",
    "we consider a ferromagnetic ising model with a small random magnetic field and a small temperature in three dimensions .",
    "the heuristic analysis goes as follows . in a finite box",
    "there are two relevant finite volume states , the one with positive magnetization and the one with negative magnetization . in a first approximation ,",
    "valid at small field and temperature , the difference in free energy of the two states is proportional to @xmath337 , which is a number of order @xmath338 . therefore ( but for rare choices of the random field ) for a given value of @xmath137 one state will dominate .",
    "however when increasing @xmath137 one will switch an infinite number of times from the situation where the magnetization is positive to a state with negative magnetization .",
    "the magnetization itself does not have a limit when the volume goes to infinity .",
    "a definite limit may be obtained by taking the limit by subsequences ( i.e. choosing only those value of @xmath137 for which the magnetization is positive or negative ) .",
    "the other possibility is in taking the average over @xmath137 and using the fact that the cesro limit ( [ e - cesaro ] ) of @xmath16 exists .",
    "once the infinite volume limit has been taken we can decompose the state in extremal dlr states .",
    "here the typical relevant states for the infinite volume limit are those with positive or negative magnetization .",
    "if we choose the first approach ( limit by appropriate subsequences ) we will find a pure state that is a clustering state . in the case of the cesro limit we will obtain a 50% mixture of the two extremal states .",
    "similar and more complex phenomena are frequent both in random and in non random system ( e.g. those having quasi periodic ground states ) .",
    "care is needed in order to obtain the infinite volume limit .",
    "statements about chaoticity are basically about the fact that the naive infinite volume limit does not converge .      at this stage",
    "it is clear that we need a lot of ingenuity in order to be able to define the b - g distribution for an infinite system .",
    "the replica approach only deals with very large but finite systems , and it does not ask what happens in an actual infinite systems .",
    "it should also be clear that the two approaches , the replica analysis of the finite volume correlations functions ( and the results which can be stated in a simple and intuitive way by using the idea of decomposition into states of the boltzmann - gibbs measure ) and the construction of pure states for an infinite system , give different information , which can be hardly compared one with the other . in the replica method one",
    "obtains information only on those states whose weight @xmath187 does not vanish in the infinite volume limit the replica method gives information on the states ( defined for that particular model ) whose weight @xmath187 is not too small .",
    "all local equilibrium states have the same free energy density : however the differences in the total free energy may grow as @xmath339 . from an infinite volume point of view",
    "all these states are equivalent , while from a finite volume point of view only the state with lower free energy and the states whose total free energy differ from the ground states by an amount of order one are relevant .",
    "for example in the ferromagnetic case ( in more than two dimensions at sufficient low temperature ) there are equilibrium states which have positive magnetization in half of the infinite volume and negative magnetization in the other half .",
    "these states are invisible in the replica method because their weight ( when restricted to a finite volume system ) goes to zero as @xmath340 , @xmath25 being an appropriate constant ( as we have already discussed special techniques , i.e. coupling replicas , may be used to recover , at least partially , this information ) . in the replica method the states are weighted with the corresponding boltzmann - gibbs weight and this weight can be hardly reconstructed from an analysis done directly at infinite volume .",
    "therefore one can not expect a priori that formulae like the relation ( [ e - wsum ] ) are valid in the infinite volume limit ( although that could happen ) : on the contrary , according to the facts we have discussed in the last paragraphs , one would better expect that the mathematical properties of an infinite system could be quite different from the ones of a finite large system .",
    "the usual formalism of the replica theory does not concern the properties of the states of an actual infinite system .      in a recent paper @xcite",
    "the authors have obtained new exact results about the behavior of finite dimensional spin glasses . here",
    "we discuss this interesting issue in some detail , and we observe that these results are in perfect agreement with the predictions of the rsb ansatz that we have been discussing in the former sections",

    "the reader should notice that it is only a bad notation to call these functions with the same name , as far as they describe very different properties of the system .",
    "in studying the properties of all these functions the rsb approach gives the correct answer , i.e. it declares self - averaging objects which are self - averaging and non - self - averaging quantities that are likely to be non - self - averaging .",
    "we will discuss here about the metastate construction @xcite , that has been introduced to allow a rigorous construction of the infinite volume limit of the quenched state .",

    "this approach generates the states that we have called @xmath366 . in the second approach ( the metastate )",
    "we consider periodic boxes of size @xmath137 , and we denote by @xmath377 the expectation value with respect to the usual b - g distribution . using equation ( [ e - cesaro ] )",

    "both procedures construct the infinite volume quenched state .",
    "one can prove that the two constructions lead to the same infinite volume equilibrium state .",
    "it can be conjectured that if one changes the boundary conditions , e.g. if one uses antiperiodic boundary conditions , the result will not change . in this way we have a natural definition of an infinite b - g state , which however involves in one way or another some kind of average .",
    "it is crucial to note that the limits mentioned before should be read in a weak sense .",
    "in other words for any given quantity @xmath25 which is a function of only a _",

    "this measure is called the _ metastate_. the results of the rsb ansatz",
    "imply that the set of states on which this measure is concentrated can not be countable .",
    "indeed if that was the case the previous formula could be written as    @xmath383    and the probability of finding two configurations in the same pure state would be given by    @xmath384    but we have shown in the previous discussion that the rsb theory predicts that the overlap distribution in the state @xmath366 ( the quenched state ) is a delta function at zero overlap , so that the probability of finding two configurations in the same pure state must be zero , in contradiction with the previous formula .",
    "we are ready now to illustrate the main flaw of a series of papers ( see @xcite and references therein ) , where the metastate approach was used to claim the presence of an internal inconsistency in the predictions of the rsb theory .",
    "the starting point of these papers was the assumption that the finite volume state can be approximately decomposed as the sum of infinite volume states :    @xmath385    this formula looks innocent and similar to the one that it is used as a starting point of the rsb approach , ( [ e - wsum ] ) , but it is indeed rather different : in the rsb theory the sum in the r.h.s . runs over the _ finite volume states _ , while in ( [ wit ] ) the sum runs over the _ infinite volume states_.    before further discussing if the heuristic results of @xcite are correct we should investigate if their starting hypothesis ( [ wit ] ) makes sense .",
    "we will show here that ( [ wit ] ) can be sometimes ( not always ) correct for ferromagnets , but it is unnatural when dealing with spin glasses . in the case of spin glasses equilibrium configurations of a system of size @xmath137 with periodic boundary condition when embedded in a larger system will have a much higher energy than the equilibrium configurations .",
    "naively one would expect an energy increase on the surface of the order of @xmath386 , but the actual increase may be smaller due to possible adjustments of the interface .",
    "the spins at @xmath136 and @xmath387 would be chosen in such a way to minimize the free energy with periodic boundary conditions , but would be out of place when merging the spin configuration in a larger system .",
    "the previous formula also fails in some ferromagnetic cases .",
    "let us consider the case which we have discussed before in section ( [ ss - nodisg ] ) of a ferromagnet with antiperiodic boundary conditions .",
    "we consider the three dimensional case , with temperature not too far from the critical one ( or equivalently the two dimensional case ) . in these conditions",
    "the interface is rough and it has a width increasing like @xmath388 in three dimensions ( in two dimensions the width is always proportional to @xmath389 ) .",
    "the divergence of the width of the interface has absolutely no consequences on the analysis of states in finite volume ( we classify the configurations in states by the average position of the interface ; the correlation functions are clustering but for a region close to the interface , which can be neglected since it is a fraction of the volume which asymptotically goes to zero ) , but it implies that in the infinite volume limit there are only two pure equilibrium states : the ones with uniform positive and uniform negative magnetization . the state with positive magnetization in half space and negative magnetization in",
    "the other half space exists only when the interface is not rough .",
    "that shows that the relation ( [ wit ] ) is not satisfied even in this very simple case ferromagnet implies that ( [ wit ] ) is never valid if we take antiperiodic boundary conditions in two directions , e.g. @xmath49 and @xmath105 . ] .",
    "the opposite conclusion would be valid in three dimensions ( but not in two dimensions ) at positive temperatures smaller than the roughening temperature , because in this case the interface would have a finite width also in the infinite volume limit .",

    "plays a central theoretical role , and the other probability distributions ( e.g. @xmath392 for @xmath396 ) are derived quantities .",
    "the existence of rigorous arguments which prove that the relation ( [ wit ] ) can not hold even in some simple cases , and of heuristic arguments which imply that it is not valid for spin glasses strongly suggests that it would be unwise to use it as the starting point of any argument .",
    "it is not a surprise that this formula ( which sometimes has been called the non - standard sk picture ) leads to contradictory conclusions .",
    "the true rsb ansatz ( the so - called sk picture or mean field picture ) that we have discussed in the previous sections ( and that , following the wording of @xcite , is different both from what @xcite call the standard sk picture and from what they call the non - standard sk picture ) , does not lead to obvious contradictions : as far as we know there are no generic arguments which question its validity .",
    "the metastate approach is telling us something about the behavior of the properties of a fixed region of space in the infinite volume limit ( essentially that there is a natural way to define such a limit if we average over the appropriate regions ) .",
    "this allows us to introduce a natural measure over pure dlr states .",
    "however this infinite volume states are states in presence of a quenched random environment : they are different from the finite volume states of the replica theory and they are not directly related to the global behavior of systems in a finite volume .    as stressed in @xcite and in @xcite the crucial problem in order to compare the rigorous approach to the rsb ansatz predictions consists in studying the behavior of the probability distribution of two ( or more ) identical replicas , @xmath397 and to verify the existence of correlations among the replicas . in particular",
    "if we study a system with the @xmath9-replicated hamiltonian ( [ repham ] ) , with positive integer @xmath9 , we can construct the infinite volume probability distribution for this @xmath9-replicated system .",

    "in particular we have already remarked that @xmath404 coincides with the probability distribution @xmath35 . moreover ( and this is a crucial issue ) the fact that @xmath405 depends on @xmath1 translate in this language as a lack of factorization of this probability :    @xmath406    spontaneous replica symmetry breaking corresponds to a non - independence of the replicas and to the presence of correlations among them .",
    "it is possible to translate the predictions of the rsb ansatz into this formalism , which can be also used to prove under general assumptions the validity of relations like ( [ guerel ] ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "one can obtain similar results also using the metastate , defining    @xmath407    and sending @xmath408 at the end .",
    "this approach is promising .",
    "the framework can also be used for studying systems without quenched disorder @xcite . using this formalism it is possible to investigate the issue of replica symmetry breaking also for systems without disorder like structural glasses . for reasons of space",
    "we will not discuss here this important point in more details .",
    "in this last part of the paper we will review briefly the large mass of numerical results that support the fact that replica symmetry is spontaneously broken in finite dimensional spin glasses .",
    "in particular we will discuss numerical results for the three and four dimensional ising spin glass with gaussian couplings and with binary couplings ( that can take the two values @xmath68 ) .",
    "we will extract from published papers only those evidences which are relevant to show that the real finite dimensional systems behave as implied from the predictions of the rsb ansatz , and we will refer to the original references for more details .",
    "we will also discuss some new numerical results ( about a precise determination of the finite size effects that affect the infinite volume sum rules of the theory and about simulations with coupled replicas ) that we will describe here in detail .",
    "we notice that the biggest systems which are fully thermalized in numerical simulations contain at most @xmath409 spins .",
    "this number is not very different from what can be realized experimentally : there are some indications that in a typical experiment it is possible to thermalize only regions containing @xmath410 spins at most @xcite .",
    "if replica predictions would fail for systems of size bigger than @xmath411 , this fact would be unobservable both in computer simulations done with the present computer technology and ( more important ) in real experiments .",
    "in this section we have chosen four figures in order to make clear some basic facts , i.e. :    1 .",
    "the @xmath86 ea spin glass undergoes a true phase transition ( figure [ fig : binder ] ) .",
    "2 .   the edward - anderson order parameter does not vanish in the thermodynamical limit ( figures [ fig : pq ] and [ fig : qea ] ) .",
    "the low temperature phase is mean - field - like ( figures [ fig : pq ] and [ fig : binder07 ] ) .",

    "this evidence has been first given by kawashima and young @xcite , and is also supported by calculations of berg and janke @xcite .",
    "as discussed in detail in the literature ( see for example @xcite ) the @xmath86 case is atypical , in which we sit very close to the lower critical dimension @xmath413 .",
    "the signature for a transition we have shown in [ fig : binder ] is indeed atypical , since more than a crossing of the different binder parameter curves we observe a merging .",

    "for the ( as we already said atypical ) case of the @xmath86 spin glass , we start by discarding the possibility , suggested by the little separation between different binder cumulant curves for @xmath104 , of the presence of a kosterlitz - thouless phase transition without a non - zero order parameter . in this case",
    "the order parameter would become zero , in the infinite volume limit , even in the low @xmath415 region .",

    "a fit with @xmath421 and a convergence with a very small power exponent ( i.e. @xmath422 ) would have a greater @xmath423 but can not be excluded from our data .",

    "if interfaces were playing a crucial role ( see the discussion in section [ ss - nodisg ] ) one would expect this distribution to tend toward a pair of @xmath445 function as @xmath452 for fixed window size @xmath93 . from figure",
    "[ fig : block_ns0 ] it is clear that this is not the case .",
    "the shape of the two probability functions is basically the same independently of the lattice size .    in figure",
    "[ fig : block_ns ] we show the probability distribution of the window overlaps as a function of the window size for a fixed lattice size , @xmath492 .",
    "the shape of the probability distribution does not change much with @xmath93 ( the largest change is when @xmath93 reaches @xmath137 , and we recover the usual overlap that is more sensitive to the presence of a finite lattice than smaller observables ) .",
    "moreover the behavior of the value of the probability distribution near the origin ( in the region of small overlaps ) is opposite to the one we would get if the model was building a simple droplet structure ( i.e. this value does not go to zero for small @xmath93 values , and it is on the contrary slightly enhanced due to the finiteness of the window size ) .    it is clear that the distinctive features characterizing the broken phase do not depend on the exact definition of the overlap : the full and the window overlaps describe the same picture of the low temperature phase .",
    "a very useful approach is based on coupling two lattice spin glass systems ( of the same size and with the same realization of the quenched random couplings ) by their mutual overlap .",
    "we define an hamiltonian :    @xmath493 \\equiv     { \\cal h}_{j}[\\sigma ] + { \\cal h}_{j}[\\tau ] -    \\frac{\\epsilon}{v } \\sum_i \\sigma_i \\tau_i \\ , \\ ] ]    where @xmath494 is the usual disordered hamiltonian defined in equation ( [ ham ] ) .",

    "we have investigate a set of @xmath229 values going from @xmath499 down to @xmath500 .",

    "we have checked that the measured overlap had reached a stable plateau ( see figure [ f - conver ] ) .",
    "the presence of the interaction term @xmath507 with a positive value of @xmath229 forces the two copies of the system to stay closer than for @xmath232 : @xmath508 will tend as @xmath509 to a value greater than the equilibrium value with @xmath232 .    for @xmath229",
    "not too small taking the infinite time limit of @xmath510 is easy .",
    "the forcing makes the correlation length ( and time ) small : the overlap tends to its asymptotic value in a reasonable time and we can obtain @xmath511 directly from the value of the plateau , without any risky extrapolation procedure .",
    "we plot in figure [ f - q_eps ] the value @xmath512 extrapolated to infinite time .",
    "next we have to estimate the limit for @xmath224 of @xmath228 . in the simplified picture of a rugged free energy landscape , made of many valleys ,",
    "the coupling between two copies forces them into the same valley , and so we expect to obtain in that limit an information about the mean size of a valley . such information , in the theory of spin glasses , is encoded in the edward - anderson order parameter ( @xmath474 ) defined as the average overlap between two replicas within the same pure state .",
    "we can reach the same conclusion following a different way of reasoning : the presence of the @xmath513 term is equivalent to a potential favoring bigger overlaps , so that at equilibrium ( @xmath514 ) @xmath228 will be the maximum overlap allowed for @xmath515 plus a term due to the interaction ,    @xmath516    for @xmath515 the probability distribution function of the absolute value of the overlap has support @xmath517 $ ] : the order parameter of the theory , @xmath518 , can be obtained via the limit @xmath519 .",
    "we have fitted the behavior of ( [ e - q_eps ] ) for the data shown in figure [ f - q_eps ] . on the best fit :    @xmath520    in the mean - field theory @xmath521 , while in previous work @xcite in @xmath414 the authors found @xmath522 .",
    "the value found for the order parameter @xmath474 is in good agreement with the one found in @xcite , where off - equilibrium measurement were suggesting @xmath523 .",

    "they have been used in the debate about the hints that one can hope to get from the migdal - kadanoff approximation when studying spin glass systems @xcite .",
    "we have analyzed the @xmath524 ea model by numerical simulations ( using a tempering algorithm and an annealing scheme , checking convergence and averaging over @xmath432 or more samples ) , with binary couplings and the hamiltonian ( [ e - hamenrere ] ) .",
    "we compare these data to the results obtained in the migdal kadanoff approximation of the same model .",
    "it turns out that one can see a clear difference , already at @xmath525 on medium - size lattices , among the mka and the ea model .    in figure",
    "[ fig : eo ] we show our results for @xmath526 versus @xmath527 .",
    "the mka gives a smooth behavior : for small @xmath229 , @xmath526 behaves like @xmath528 , with @xmath529 .",
    "finite size effects look very small for these sizes ( from @xmath438 to @xmath530 ) .",
    "the ea model behaves in a completely different way . here",
    "finite size effects are large , and the behavior for small @xmath229 becomes more singular for larger sizes .",
    "the @xmath531 lattice is reminiscent of the mka behavior , but already at @xmath491 the difference is clear . from our data we are not able to definitely establish the existence of a discontinuity , but the numerical evidence is strongly suggestive of that .",
    "the data are suggestive of the building up of a discontinuity as @xmath452 , i.e. @xmath532 for @xmath233 and @xmath533 for @xmath534 , with @xmath535 and an exponent @xmath380 close to @xmath536 : a continuous behavior ( i.e. @xmath537 ) can not be excluded from these data , but in this case we find an upper limit @xmath538 , totally different from the behavior of mka , @xmath539 .",
    "the ultrametric organization of the equilibrium states is one of most distinctive and striking features of the rsb solution of the spin glass mean field theory .",
    "checking if an organization of the same kind still rules the state distribution in finite dimensional models is a task of large interest @xcite .",
    "[ fig : ultra ]    the issue of the ultrametricity in a finite number of dimensions has been checked numerically in @xcite .",
    "the most convincing numerical tests have been done in four dimensions , since there the phase transition is more clear . in figure",
    "[ fig : ultra ] we plot the probability ( @xmath540 ) of the appearance of an overlap which is forbidden by ultrametricity as a function of the lattice size .",
    "this probability goes to zero as @xmath452 with a power law in @xmath137 , and the power law ( i.e an exponent of @xmath541 ) is consistent with expectations coming from mean field analytic computations ( for more details see @xcite ) .",
    "the support to the existence of a low temperature phase with an ultrametric structure of states is very strong .",
    "other numerical simulations done with a different technique in three dimensions on systems with side from @xmath438 to @xmath436 are compatible with ultrametricity , but the approach to zero seems to be much slower that in four dimension and at the present moment it is difficult to reach a definite conclusion @xcite",
    ". this problem should be better investigated in the future .",
    "we recall that is also possible to show @xcite , by using the set of sum rules we have discussed before , that if the states are organized ultrametrically in a finite dimensional spin glass the detailed structure of the ultrametric organization has to be exactly the same of the mean field solution .",
    "this fact does not prove ultrametricity , but once ultrametricity has been detected ( for example numerically ) it allows to establish many other important results about the structure of the system .",
    "[ fig : fdt_1 ]    the analysis of the dynamical behavior of spin glasses can give a large amount of information ( see section [ ss - dynapp ] earlier in the text for a first discussion and references ) .",
    "here we summarize some nice numerical results concerning the dynamical determination of the overlap probability distribution , from reference @xcite .    as we have already discussed , the basic ingredients of the dynamical approach are the autocorrelation function @xmath542 and the integrated response function .",
    "we use a magnetic field that jumps at time @xmath543 :    @xmath544    in this way by computing the function @xmath545 $ ] one can test numerically the validity of the relation ( [ mag_fdt ] ) , that relates the magnetization and the correlation function . in other words",
    "we try to check that the function @xmath305 depends only on the value of the correlation function @xmath542 ( and not on the times @xmath292 and @xmath546 ) even for large but finite times .",
    "a second interesting goal is to check that @xmath305 is given by the integrated probability distribution of the overlap .",
    "we have simulated four couples of spin samples , with gaussian couplings , on a @xmath467 lattice in three dimensions .",
    "we have used two different values of the magnetic fields in order to control the validity of the linear response approximation .",
    "we show in figure [ fig : fdt_1 ] the results for the function @xmath305 . we have also plotted the equilibrium behavior , where the fdt theorem holds ( i.e. the straight line @xmath547 ) .",
    "this method also gives us a way to estimate the order parameter of the system as the point where the function @xmath305 departs from the fdt regime . from figure",
    "[ fig : fdt_1 ] we can estimate the value of the order parameter as @xmath548 , in very good agreement with the equilibrium value quoted before ( @xmath549 ) ( see figure [ fig : qea ] ) .",
    "we remind the reader that    @xmath550    where @xmath35 is the equilibrium probability distribution of the overlap .",
    "> from [ fig : fdt_1 ] it is clear that for not too large waiting time the function @xmath305 depends only on the value of the correlation function .",
    "moreover the equilibrium @xmath39 matches extraordinarily well the @xmath305 function .",
    "it is clear that @xmath39 does not have the form suggested by a droplet like picture .",
    "the droplet picture predicts a linear region with slope @xmath304 ( the equilibrium regime , @xmath551 $ ] ) and another regime where we have a horizontal line ( @xmath552 $ ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : fdt_1 ] rules out this possibility .",
    "in this note we hope we have succeeded in clarifying better the precise nature of the predictions of the replica symmetry breaking approach , and the numerical and analytical evidences available to support its validity in finite dimensional , realistic spin glasses .",
    "it is clear that there are many issues that need clarification : for example working out a field theory describing finite dimensional systems would be crucial .",
    "also numerical simulations need to be improved , and pushed to lower @xmath415 values ( where the effect of the critical point at @xmath416 is not obscuring too much the real low @xmath415 structure of the system ) .",
    "let us stress again the points of bigger relevance .",
    "correlation functions have been studied in detail in finite dimensional systems , and they confirm a rsb picture . the proposal that a nontrivial function @xmath35 is an artifact due to the presence of interfaces among two equilibrium states has been analyzed and falsified : the study of window overlaps confirms that the non - trivial shape of @xmath35 is not due to the presence of interfaces .",
    "coupling replicas helps again in observing clear signatures of replica symmetry breaking .",
