    "strongly correlated systems continue to be a popular subject due to the importance of these systems in physical processes in general .",
    "electron systems form an important subset of these systems .",
    "the nonlinearity that appears in this type of problem complicates greatly the calculation of any physical properties of the system that strongly depend on the correlation between the individual particles . in this paper",
    "we are mainly concerned with a particular aspect of this area , that is , of calculating the ground state equilibrium energy of a large fermi gas in an external potential , at both zero and at nonzero temperature . at zero temperature",
    "the random phase approximation ( rpa ) is a well known method which addresses this problem . here",
    "we present a way to improve on it , using an effective action method , which includes higher order interactions in a consistent way .",
    "this new method is also applicable at finite temperature . at low temperature ,",
    "the  new method shows clearly the importance of the so called `` anomalous diagrams '' in cancelling the non - physical @xmath0 term in the specific heat @xcite .",
    "another important aspect of this new approach is that it is applicable to nonhomogeneous fermi systems .",
    "the currently popular method for treating such systems is the density functional method ( dft)@xcite , @xcite . in dft ,",
    "the density of the system plays a central role and the energy is a functional of it .",
    "both the current method and density functional method are extensions of the thomas - fermi method . in dft",
    "the density is found by solving self - consistently a one - particle schrodinger equation .",
    "correlation effects are taken into account by using the homogeneous result locally .",
    "the kinetic energy term is taken to be that of a non - interacting system having the same density as the real system under consideration . in spite of all these approximations ,",
    "density functional methods have proved to give better values for binding energies than hartree - fock in atoms , molecules and solids in general .",
    "however the method works best only for almost homogeneous systems ; surface effects are handled poorly by this method .",
    "so far the attempt to include a gradient of the density in the energy functional makes the result worse .",
    "the success of the method is therefore limited .",
    "here we propose a different method , that in principle can treat nonhomogeneity in a better fashion .",
    "however , the problem becomes harder to manage numerically .",
    "the method proposed here is a path integral method known as the effective action method . in one dimension",
    "it reduces to the well - known wkb method to first approximation .",
    "this work is a first step toward finding a new practical scheme for the evaluation of correlation energies and other physical properties of strongly correlated electron systems using this method .    in the homogeneous case ,",
    "the effectiveness of the method was demonstrated in ref.@xcite .",
    "a closely related approach also appears in ref .",
    "@xcite where the gap equation in a superconductor has been derived using effective action ideas . in field theory this method also received some attention recently in treating a scalar field with a quartic interaction @xcite . here",
    "we carry out the calculations  of the energy in the non - homogeneous case as far as possible analytically .",
    "it will be seen that the method provides a very compact expression for the energy that goes beyond the rpa method in a natural way .",
    "we also apply our result for the energy to the homogeneous case .",
    "we  explicitly calculate the effect of taking exchange into account in the ring diagrams .",
    "our results agree well with results obtained using quantum monte carlo methods .    in the following , we will present a way to compute the free energy of the electron system .",
    "zero temperature results follow easily from this calculation .",
    "the system is assumed to be in an external static potential @xmath1 .",
    "the result that we get is very general and could be applied to many different systems .",
    "the paper is laid out as follows : in the next section , section 2 , we introduce the thermodynamic potential @xmath2 for a system subject to external sources . @xmath2 therefore will be a functional of these sources . the functional @xmath2 is the generator of connected green s functions at finite temperature . usually , one point source functions are used . here",
    ", we will instead introduce two - point functions @xcite , @xcite , @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the introduction of two - point external sources enables us to take into account the higher order corrections to the stationary phase approximation of the partition function in a better way . by including merely two diagrams ( expressed in terms of the variables which are conjugate to the external sources ) in the effective action",
    ", we are able to obtain the contribution of all the second order diagrams ( and beyond ) of the coulomb interaction to the energy in a very compact way ( see fig .  [ expansion ] ) .",
    "this is the crucial advantage of this version of the effective action .",
    "the diagrams which are included here are two - particle irreducible , in contrast to the one - particle irreducible diagrams that we get when only one - point functions are used in the effective action .",
    "however , before doing this , we introduce a new field to replace the quartic coulomb interaction by the well known stratanovich - hubbard transformation , so that all the interactions become local .",
    "this new field is simply the hartree potential as in the rpa method @xcite .",
    "however the treatment presented here is somewhat different from the one in the aforementioned reference . here",
    ", we explicitly introduce a term that describes correlation of the hartree field at two locations .",
    "the sources can also be taken to be instantaneous so we can get a time - translation invariant solution .    in section 3 , we introduce the finite temperature effective action @xmath3 .",
    "we get this action by a legendre transformation from @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , we introduce new variables conjugate to the sources .",
    "this is exactly the same type of transformation as is used in thermodynamics . at the tree level ,",
    "the @xmath3 functional is simply the action of the system and is related to the free energy of the system .",
    "for homogeneous systems , @xmath3 is known as the effective potential . in our case @xmath3",
    "will be a functional of three variables , the hartree potential @xmath4 , the correlation function @xmath5 of the hartree potential , and the green s function @xmath6 of the fermi field .",
    "if the external sources are taken to be instantaneous , the points @xmath7 and @xmath8 , correspond to the same temperature , @xmath9 , and the function @xmath10 simply becomes the density matrix of the system . @xmath11 and @xmath12 are spin indices . even though it is possible to express the free energy in terms of the density matrix , it makes the manipulations more cumbersome .    in section 4 , we solve for @xmath13 and @xmath5 in terms of @xmath14 .",
    "we are able to do this simply because in reality @xmath10 is the only independent variable . in this case",
    "we get an expression for the effective action @xmath3 in terms of the density only . therefore getting an expression for @xmath3 in terms of @xmath14",
    "is the essential result of this work from which other important calculations can be made .    in section 5",
    ", we give an explicit expression for the free energy in the homogeneous case in a neutral background . here",
    "we go beyond the rpa results .",
    "we show that new diagrams appear at finite temperature .",
    "the famous ` anomalous ' diagram is just one of them ( see fig .  [ anomalous ] ) .",
    "an important outcome of this calculation is the disappearance of the @xmath15 behavior in the specific heat that is due to exchange @xcite .    in section 6",
    ", we treat the zero temperature case .",
    "we show explicitly that the anomalous diagrams disappear as they should . here again we go beyond rpa to include exchange effects on the ring diagrams .",
    "we also show that some of the ladder terms are included in our approximation .    in section 7",
    ", we continue the treatment started in the previous section and calculate the contribution of the ring diagrams if they include exchange .",
    "in the conclusion , we reexamine the non - homogeneous problem .",
    "we show how this method is related to the dft formalism .",
    "in fact it is shown that a statement like the hohenberg - kohn theorem is trivially realized in this formalism .",
    "similarly the question of v - representability can be given an affirmative answer within perturbation theory .",
    "in this section , we obtain an expression for the functional @xmath2 to ` order ' @xmath17 .",
    "this functional is the logarithm of the partition functional @xmath18 of the system in the presence of external sources .",
    "the @xmath18 functional is written as an integral over all possible allowable paths of the different fields with a weighting factor that depends on the value of the action of the given path .",
    "the functional @xmath2 is simply the generating functional of connected green s functions at finite temperature of the fields involved .",
    "however because the coulomb interaction , quartic in the fermion field , is hard to integrate , we introduce an auxiliary field by means of the well known hubbard - stratanovich transformation so that we can avoid the quartic interaction and its nonlocal behavior . in other words ,",
    "the procedure consists of transforming the problem into one in which the electrons interact locally with a hartree - type potential . in this",
    "treatment , exchange energy terms will show up directly because of the anti - commutation of the fermi fields , which is built into the calculation as will be described below . the correlation terms are due to the quantum fluctuations around the hartree potential",
    ".    in the following we give an explicit derivation of the terms to order @xmath17 in @xmath2 and no counting will be necessary .",
    "what we mean here is that we are including effects of second order in the _ full _ hartree field of the theory .",
    "the equation of motion satisfied by @xmath19 goes therefore beyond the hartree - fock approximation and involves second order exchange effects .    a non - relativistic interacting electron gas in an external potential @xmath1",
    "has the following hamiltonian in the second quantized form : @xmath20 \\nonumber\\\\ & + \\frac{1}{2}\\int d^{3}xd^{3}y\\frac{1}{|\\vec{x}-\\vec{y}|}\\psi_{\\alpha } ^{\\dagger}(x)\\psi_{\\nu}^{\\dagger}(y)\\psi_{\\nu}(y)\\psi_{\\alpha}(x).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , we use units such that @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath23 is a two - component temperature - dependent electron field . @xmath11 and @xmath24 are spin indices , i.e. , @xmath25 for spin up and @xmath26 for spin down .",
    "summation is implicit for repeated indices . in the following @xmath27",
    "will always mean a 3-d space vector .",
    "the system is constrained by the condition @xmath28 where n is the electron number operator which is constant .",
    "therefore the density operator is simply @xmath29 because of this constraint , we prefer to work instead with the following hamiltonian @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a lagrangian multiplier .",
    "the electron operator @xmath23 can be expanded in terms of a complete orthonormal set of one - particle functions @xmath32 so we write @xmath33 @xmath34 and @xmath35 are annihilation and creation operators .",
    "the subscript @xmath36 includes momentum and spin .",
    "the ground state and the excited states can be represented as slater determinants formed by the wave functions @xmath37 . in our case , it will be advantageous to take these functions to be self - consistent hartree eigenfunctions . in the homogeneous case they reduce to plane waves . since we are going to use a path integral formulation , we give the lagrangian associated with the hamiltonian h. @xmath38 \\nonumber\\\\ & -\\frac{1}{2}\\int d^{3}xd^{3}y\\frac{1}{|\\vec{x}-\\vec{y}|}\\psi^{\\dagger } ( x)\\psi^{\\dagger}(y)\\psi(y)\\psi(x ) .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so for a system at thermal equilibrium , we have to replace the time component t in the hamiltonian by @xmath39 .",

    "we stress that this expansion is valid for both small and large @xmath216 .    from the above analysis",

    "are expected to be the next important ones that must be summed up .",
    "it is also easily seen from the above that all second order diagrams are included in the expansion with the right symmetry factors .",

    "[ secondlog ] is that they include the `` anomalous '' diagrams @xcite .",

    "however these diagrams become essential at non - zero temperature where the above constraint of fermi statistic is no longer an issue . in the following section we calculate the contribution of the function @xmath343 to the correlation energy",
    "in this section , we give the contribution of diagrams like those shown in fig .",
    "[ ringexchange ] to the correlation energy at zero temperature .",
    "hence we go beyond rpa in this case .",
    "we will show that our method provides excellent agreement with fully numerical calculations .",
    "we also compare our results to those found in ref.@xcite where a coupled cluster formalism has been used to get the correlation energy .",
    "our final results clearly show that our method is more transparent than other previously used methods . to get to these final results we had to make approximations along the way .",
    "we use two different approximations : the hubbard approximation in ref.@xcite and the bishop - luhrmann approximation , ref.@xcite .",
    "we have found that the former applies well to high values of @xmath216 while the latter applies well to low values of @xmath216 . from eq.(118 ) , this amounts to finding @xmath344 and the second order exchange term that has already been calculated by onsager et al . in ref.@xcite .",
    "now we show how to calculate @xmath344 .",

    "most of the complications are related to the angle integrals which can not be separated . to be able to make some progress we have to make an approximation , i.e.",
    ", we either assume that @xmath349 and average over the angle between them , i.e. , the hubbard approximation or we use a more sophisticated approximation like the one proposed by bishop and luhrmann ( bl ) .",
    "hubbard s approximation amounts to the following : @xmath350 on the other hand , the bl - approximation is more complicated and the reader is referred to their appendix in ref.@xcite for a discussion of their approximation .",
    "the two approximations are almost equivalent for large values of momentum @xmath348 , i.e. @xmath351 in units of fermi momentum . for values of @xmath348 less than 2 ,",
    "both approximations are quite different ( see fig .",
    "[ hbl_graph ] ) .",
    "the hubbard approximation seems to apply well for moderately large values of @xmath216 while the bl - approximation applies well for low values of @xmath216 .",
    "in fact the bl - approximation incorporates the fermi statistics of the interacting particles where it matters most , i.e. in high density situations , and this is one reason why we found it to be a good approximation to the exchange coulomb interaction for low @xmath216 .",
    "the hubbard approximation should be expected to be a good approximation to particles near the fermi surface and where statistics is not an issue .",
    "the case of low density should apply well to this case .",
    "given either approximation we end up with an expression for @xmath352 of the form : @xmath353 where the function @xmath354 is our approximation to the exchange term in @xmath343 and is assumed known .",
    "the integrations over @xmath355 and @xmath356 are easily found if we choose to write both vectors in cylindrical coordinates with @xmath357 along the z - axis , i.e. , @xmath358 hence the integration over @xmath355 becomes : @xmath359 where @xmath360 @xmath361 @xmath362 with an equivalent expression for the region of integration over @xmath363 .",

    "clearly the latter is closer to the true value of 0.0484 @xmath370 , but we believe that this is not enough to decide against using the hubbard approximation .",
    "in fact at low @xmath216 we expect that the high energy part of the exchange energy between particles to dominate and this explains why we found the bl - approximations to apply well in this range . at high @xmath216",
    "this is not true anymore and in this instance we expect the bl - approximation to overestimate this exchange of energy between the particles .",
    "this is in fact what we have found .",
    "this casts doubts that the bl - approximation is always better than the hubbard approximation . as we said above the second order exchange term",
    "is not a good test since it is density independent .",
    "this explains why the hubbard approximation gives better results for higher values of @xmath216 .",
    "below we give some numerical answers to compare with those obtained using quantum monte carlo methods ( qmc ) @xcite .",
    "our results are obtained using both approximations . for the second order exchange diagram",
    "we have used the true value of 0.0484 ryd .",

    "i.e. , @xmath216 @xmath373 our results do not compare well to the qmc results .",
    "however this is expected since we need to include corrections due to the ladder diagrams which are believed to be important at low densities .",
    "this concludes our calculations .  we have shown the effectiveness of an effective action approach to electronic systems . in the next section we shall state the viability of using this formalism in the nonhonogeneous case and show how it is related to density functional theory",
    "in this last section , we would like to go back to the inhomogeneous case and show how our method gives some of the results known in dft @xcite @xcite .",
    "we start by briefly reviewing the basic ideas behind dft .",
    "the hamiltonian h is written as the sum of three terms : t , v and u. t is the kinetic energy term , v is the external potential term and u is the coulomb energy term .",
    "so we have @xmath374@xmath375@xmath376@xmath377 if @xmath378 is the ground state , then the density @xmath379 is given by @xmath380 the first important fact to note is that @xmath381 is a unique functional of @xmath379 , assuming that there is a unique ground state for the system .",
    "now let the functionals @xmath382 $ ] and @xmath383 $ ] be defined as follows : @xmath384=\\langle\\psi|t+u|\\psi\\rangle\\text { } , \\]]@xmath385=\\int v(r)n(r)d^{3}r+\\;f[n(r)]\\text { } .\\ ] ] then , if we assume that there is a one - to - one correspondence between @xmath379 and @xmath381 , it can be shown that @xmath386}{\\delta n(r)}|_{g.s}=0\\text { } , \\ ] ] with @xmath387 this result is called the hohenberg - kohn theorem .",
    "next , the coulomb energy is isolated from the functional @xmath388 $ ] by introducing a new functional @xmath389   $ ] : @xmath390=\\frac{1}{2}\\int \\ : d\\vec{r}\\ : d{\\vec{r}}^{\\prime } \\frac{n(r)\\;n(r^{\\prime})}{|r - r^{\\prime}|}\\ : + \\",

    "dft calculations are essentially centered around finding good approximations to the functional @xmath395 $ ] .",
    "this is usually done by postulating that there is a virtual system of free electrons in an external potential with exactly the same density as the interacting system .",
    "the energy is found by finding the eigenfunctions that correspond to this external potential self consistently .",
    "the method that was presented here is in fact similar in many ways to the above ideas expressed in dft .",
    "however there are major differences .",
    "our method clearly incorporates the hohenberg - kohn theorem . from eq.(35 ) , we have the following @xmath396}{\\delta \\rho ( x , x ) } = - q(x , x ) \\ : .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from eq.(49 ) , the term @xmath397 can be separated from the energy @xmath398 .",
    "hence if we set @xmath399 , we get right away the hohenberg - kohn result .",
    "in fact we now have an explicit expression for @xmath400 $ ] within perturbation theory .",
    "this result also shows the one - to - one correspondence between density and external potential as long as there is a unique solution around @xmath401 for the defining equations , eqs.(33 - 35 ) .",
    "we have solved these equations only approximately .",
    "we have made two important approximations .",
    "the first corresponds to the number of diagrams included in @xmath3 from the outset .",
    "however from the calculations of the homogeneous case , we see that it will probably be the case that including only two diagrams in the inhomogeneous case will give good results . including higher order corrections by taking into account diagrams like the ones in fig .",
    "[ nextterm ] is nevertheless straightforward if more accurate results are desired .",
    "the second approximation we have made is that in solving for @xmath19 .",
    "we had to linearize the equations of motions to be able to solve for @xmath19 iteratively .",
    "also from eq.(50 ) , we get the following equivalent result : @xmath402    clearly our method is a generalization of the thomas - fermi method where @xmath379 in the last equation is the _ true _ density of the system .",
    "a very important difference from dft is that within this method we have a systematic scheme for calculating the functional @xmath395 $ ] , eq.(49 ) . from the above analysis in the homogeneous case , it is obvious that the most important contribution to correlation at zero temperature comes from calculating the following term : @xmath403 where @xmath404 to calculate the determinant of the above operators , we need a basis of wavefunctions . in practical computations ,",
    "it is more advantageous to use a finite basis set .",
    "if we choose as our basis set the wavefunctions @xmath405 with eigenvalues @xmath406 such that @xmath407 then the wavefunctions , @xmath408 , of the full interacting system of @xmath214 electrons can be written as a linear combination of the above wavefunctions : @xmath409 the coefficients @xmath410 are found self consistently by solving eq.(56 ) . to solve for @xmath411",
    ", we solve eq.(53 ) self - consistently .",
    "clearly our method is computationally more intensive than dft .",
    "however here we are on more secure grounds and our approximations are very well controlled to any desired accuracy .",
    "plans to apply this method to simple atoms are underway .",
    "we hope to report on these developments elsewhere .",
    "finally , we would like to point out that this method applies equally well to excited states other than the ground state .",
    "the hartree field of the excited state is found again by using eq.(33 ) .",
    "if @xmath412 is the ground state solution then @xmath413 is the excited state solution iff @xmath414 this implies that @xmath415 in the above @xmath416 is assumed small compared to @xmath412 .",
    "this latter equation enables us to solve for @xmath416 and hence the corresponding @xmath19 .",
    "clearly effective actions methods are in general superior to conventional methods as is well known in field theory .",
