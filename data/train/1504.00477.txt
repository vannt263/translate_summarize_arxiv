    "convexity , rooted in the very concept of probability , is one of unavoidable mathematical features of our description of physical systems .",
    "operationally , it originates in our ability to switch randomly between different physical devices of the same type . as a result , all elementary quantum structures and most of the quantum properties are `` dressed in convex clothes '' .",
    "for example , the sets of states , observables and processes are all convex , and it is of foundational interest to understand the similarities and identify the differences of their convex structures .    for any convex set , we may introduce the concept of an interior point in a natural way as a point that can be connected to any other point by a line segment containing it in its interior .",
    "we will use this concept to define mixedness and boundariness as measures evaluating how much the element is not extremal , or how much the element is not a boundary point , respectively .",
    "more precisely , mixedness will be determined via the highest weight occurring in decompositions into extremal points and boundariness will be determined via the highest weight occurring in decompositions into boundary points . in both cases , these numbers",
    "tell us how much randomness is needed to create the given element .",
    "since we focus on sets of quantum devices related to finite dimensional hilbert spaces , we will work in finite dimensional setting , but note that similar definitions can be introduced also in infinite dimensions , although some of the facts used below are no longer true .",
    "if the given convex set is also compact , it can be viewed as a base of a closed pointed convex cone and we may consider the corresponding base norm in the generated vector space ( see e.g. @xcite ) . note that the related distance between points of the base can be determined solely from the convex structure of the base ( see for instance recent works @xcite ) . as it is well known for quantum states @xcite and as has been recently proved for other quantum devices @xcite , this distance is closely related to the minimum error discrimination problem .",
    "it was proved in ref .",
    "@xcite that for the sets of quantum states and observables , boundariness and the base norm distance are closely related .",
    "more precisely , the largest distance of a given interior point @xmath0 from another point of the base is given in terms of boundariness of @xmath0 .",
    "in the present paper , we show that this is true for any base of the positive cone in a finite dimensional ordered vector space . in particular , for sets of quantum devices , this property singles out a subset of extremal elements that are best distinguishable from interior points . exploiting these results",
    ", we will point out an interesting difference between the convex sets of states and channels , and also provide an unexpected operational characterization of unitary channels .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we will provide readers with basic elements of convex analysis and quantum theory relevant for the rest of the paper .",
    "the concept of boundariness will be introduced in section iii , where various equivalent definitions will be stated and also its operational meaning will be discussed . in section iv we will investigate the boundariness for the case of quantum channels . in particular , we will prove a conjecture stated in ref .  @xcite . in section v we will address the question of boundariness for composition of systems and section vi is devoted to identification of elements for which boundariness achieves its maximal value .",

    "we assume that @xmath3 is _ pointed _ , i.e. @xmath4 , and _ generating _ , i.e. @xmath5 . then @xmath6 becomes a partially ordered vector space , with @xmath3 the cone of positive elements .",

    "interior points @xmath12 of the cone @xmath3 are characterized by the property that for each @xmath13 there is some @xmath14 such that @xmath15 , that is , the interior points of @xmath3 are precisely the _ order units _ in @xmath6 .",

    "@xmath24 is defined as the interior of @xmath25 with respect to the relative topology in the smallest affine subspace containing @xmath25 .",
    "note that we have @xmath26 , so that the boundary points @xmath27 can be characterized as in the previous lemma .",
    "there is a one - to - one correspondence between bases @xmath21 and order units in the dual space @xmath28 , such that @xmath29 is a base of @xmath3 if and only if @xmath30 is an order unit .",
    "the order unit @xmath30 determines the _ order unit norm _ in @xmath31 as @xmath32 its dual is the _ base norm _ @xmath33 in @xmath6 .",
    "in particular , we obtain the following expression for the corresponding distance of elements of @xmath25 : @xmath34    we will now describe the basic convex sets ( see ref.@xcite ) of quantum states , channels and measurements ( observables ) .",
    "let us stress that each of these sets is a compact convex subset in a finite dimensional vector space and as such forms a base of the positive cone of some partially ordered vector space , so that these sets fit into the framework introduced above .",
    "let us denote by @xmath35 the @xmath36-dimensional hilbert space associated with the studied physical system .",
    "then @xmath37 stands for the set of all density operators ( positive linear operators of unit trace ) representing the set of quantum states .",
    "observables are identified with positive - operator valued measures ( povms ) being determined by a collection of effects @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) normalized as @xmath40 . each effect",
    "@xmath41 defines a different measurement outcome .",

    "the set of quantum channels of a finite - dimensional quantum system is mathematically closely related to the set of density operators ( states ) of a composite system . in particular ,",

    "only a special ( convex ) subset of density operators on @xmath49 can be identified with quantum channels on @xmath36-dimensional quantum systems .",
    "for any element of a compact convex subset @xmath54 with boundary @xmath55 and a set of extremal elements @xmath56 we may introduce the concepts of _ mixedness _ and _ boundariness _ evaluating the `` distance '' of the element from extremal and boundary points , respectively . for any convex decomposition @xmath57 , where @xmath58 and @xmath59 , we define its maximal weight @xmath60 . using this quantity , we may express the mixedness of @xmath61 as follows @xmath62 where supremum is taken over all convex decompositions of @xmath0 into extremal elements . in a similar way we may define the boundariness @xcite of @xmath0 as @xmath63 where",

    "this surprising result provides quite unexpected operational characterization of unitary channels and exhibits their specific role among boundary elements and in minimum error discrimination questions .",
    "the unique role of unitary channels is noticeable also in the explicit formula that we derived for the evaluation of boundariness of channels . in the current paper we investigated only quantum channels mapping between hilbert spaces of the same dimension .",
    "the results can be easily generalized for the case when the input has smaller dimension than the output .",
    "the role of unitary channels will be played by isometries .",
    "the opposite relation of the input / output dimensions seems to be much more complicated and is left for future research .",
    "further we investigated how the boundariness behaves under the tensor product .",
    "we have shown that boundariness is a multiplicative quantity for states and observables , however , for channels we proved only the sub - multiplicativity @xmath302 however , our numerical analysis suggests that the boundariness is multiplicative also for case of channels .",
    "exploiting the relation between the boundariness and the discrimination , the multiplicativity implies that the most distinguishable element from @xmath303 is still a factorized element @xmath304 , where @xmath305 stands for the most distinguishable elements from @xmath253 , respectively . for channels",
    "this would mean that factorized unitaries are the most distant ones for all factorized channels .",
    "however , whether this is the case is left open .    in the remaining part of the paper we evaluated explicitly the maximal value of boundariness .",
    "we found that this maximum is achieved for intuitively the maximally mixed elements , i.e. for completely mixed state , uniformly trivial observables and channel contracting state space to the completely mixed state .",
    "in particular , for @xmath36-dimensional quantum systems we found for states @xmath280 , for observables @xmath306 is independent on the dimension ( only the number of outcomes @xmath283 matters ) , and for channels @xmath307 .",
    "let us stress that these numbers also determine the optimal values of error probability for related discrimination problems .",
