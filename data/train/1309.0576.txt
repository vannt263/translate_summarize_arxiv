    "in recent years , a number of papers have considered the feedback control of systems whose dynamics are governed by the laws of quantum mechanics instead of classical mechanics ; see e.g. , @xcite . in particular , the papers @xcite consider a framework for quantum systems defined in terms of a triple @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a scattering matrix , @xmath2 is a vector of coupling operators , and @xmath3 is a hamiltonian operator .",
    "the papers @xcite consider the problem of absolute stability of a quantum system defined in terms of a triple @xmath0 where the quantum system hamiltonian is decomposed as @xmath4 , @xmath5 is a known nominal hamiltonian and @xmath6 a perturbation hamiltonian , which is contained a specified set of hamiltonians @xmath7 .",
    "in particular , the papers @xcite consider the case in which the nominal hamiltonian @xmath5 is a quadratic function of annihilation and creation operators and the elements of the coupling operator vector are linear functions of the annihilation and creation operators .",
    "this case corresponds to a nominal linear quantum system ; for example , see @xcite .",
    "the results in @xcite were extended in @xcite to allow for uncertainty in the coupling operator @xmath2 .",
    "also , the results of @xcite have been used in the robust stability analysis of a quantum system consisting of a josephson junction in a resonant cavity ; see @xcite .    in the paper @xcite",
    ", it is assumed that @xmath8 is contained in a set of non - quadratic perturbation hamiltonians bounded according to a sector bound on the nonlinearity . in this case",
    ", @xcite obtained a robust stability result in terms of a frequency domain condition .",
    "this result can be regarded as a quantum version of the classical small gain theorem for the case of static sector bounded nonlinearities ; e.g. , see @xcite .",
    "also , the paper @xcite limited attention to quadratic perturbation hamiltonians . in this case",
    ", a frequency domain robust stability condition is also obtained .",
    "it is well known that the classical small gain robust stability condition also applies in the case of nonlinear dynamic uncertainties .",
    "such uncertainties can be described in terms of integral quadratic constraints ( iqcs ) ; e.g. , see @xcite .",
    "the main result of this paper extends the quantum small gain result of @xcite to allow for nonlinear dynamic uncertainties which are described by a certain quantum stochastic integral quadratic constraint ( qsiqc ) .",
    "this uncertainty description can be regarded as a continuous time quantum version of the stochastic uncertainty constraint considered in @xcite . in our main result",
    ", the presence of dynamic uncertainties is represented by a perturbation hamiltonian which depends on system variables which are in addition to those which occur in the nominal system hamiltonian .",
    "an example in the paper @xcite considers the robust stability analysis of a quantum system consisting of a linearized optical parametric amplifier ( opa ) .",
    "optical parametric amplifiers are widely used in the field of experimental quantum optics used ; see e.g. @xcite . in particular , they can be used to generate squeezed light , which has a smaller noise variance in one quadrature than the standard quantum limit would allow .",
    "this is at the expense of a larger noise variance in the other quadrature ; see e.g. @xcite .",
    "such an opa can be made using a nonlinear optical medium in an optical cavity ; for example , see @xcite .",
    "this allows for the interaction between a fundamental optical field and a second harmonic optical field .",
    "the paper @xcite analyzed a linearized model of the opa which considered only the fundamental field and the fundamental mode of the cavity .",
    "to illustrate the results of this paper , we will analyze a linearized model of an opa which considers both the fundamental and second harmonic fields and cavity modes . in this case , the second harmonic cavity mode will be considered as a dynamic uncertainty satisfying a qsiqc .",
    "in this section , we describe the general class of quantum systems under consideration . as in the papers @xcite",
    ", we consider uncertain nonlinear open quantum systems defined by parameters @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the scattering matrix , which is typically chosen as the identity matrix , l is the coupling operator and @xmath3 is the system hamiltonian operator which is assumed to be of the form @xmath9 m \\left[\\begin{array}{c}a \\\\ a^\\#\\end{array}\\right]+f(b , b^\\#,z , z^*).\\ ] ] here @xmath10 is a vector of annihilation operators on the underlying hilbert space and @xmath11 is the corresponding vector of creation operators . also the vectors of operators , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are defined similarly .",

    "the matrix @xmath21 is assumed to be known and defines the nominal quadratic part of the system hamiltonian .",
