    "electron transport through single - molecule transistors ( smts ) has been intensively studied theoretically in recent years @xcite driven by ongoing experimental advances  @xcite .",
    "one of the most distinctive features of smts , compared to artificially nano - structured devices such as quantum dots , is the coupling between their _ quantized _ mechanical and electronic degrees of freedom  @xcite . the size and shape distortions of an smt  @xcite and its center - of - mass motion  @xcite result in sharp transport resonances whose",
    "amplitudes are governed by the quantum mechanical overlap of the corresponding _ mechanical _ wavefunctions .",
    "this franck - condon ( fc ) _ transport _ effect is of fundamental interest since it is induced by the change of molecular charge , therefore involving strong electron charging and non - equilibrium effects , in contrast to the usual fc - effect in optical spectroscopy where the charge remains unaltered .",
    "the discrete vibrational modes of a molecule are also important in assessing the atomistic details of the transport junction  @xcite . finally , the demonstrated control over the molecular energy levels of an smt using a gate electrode",
    "provides interesting perspectives for realizing quantized nano - electromechanical systems ( nems)@xcite .",
    "the basic fc transport picture  @xcite assumes single electrons to sequentially tunnel on and off the smt .",
    "this is valid in the limit of weak tunnel coupling and for applied gate- and bias - voltages such that fluctuations of the molecular charge are not suppressed by coulomb interaction ( coulomb blockade ) or quantum confinement effects . in this limit",
    "it is sufficient to describe transport in lowest non - vanishing order perturbation theory in the tunneling and many interesting results have been reported .",
    "for instance , a well studied model in this context is the anderson - holstein model , consisting of a spin - degenerate level with a linear coupling ( electron - vibration coupling , @xmath0 ) between the charge on the level and the coordinate of a vibrational mode .",
    "when the overlap integrals between low lying vibrational states in two adjacent charge states of the smt vanish , a suppression of single - electron tunneling ( set ) occurs , called franck - condon blockade  @xcite . here",
    "electron transport was found to take place through self - similar avalanches , leading to bunching of electrons and enhanced shot noise . extending the basic model with a charge - dependent vibrational frequency ,",
    "additional resonances occur  @xcite , and interference of vibrational wavefunctions was shown to lead to a suppression of the electric current at finite bias  @xcite due to a population inversion of the vibrational distribution . more complex models with ( quasi-)degenerate electronic orbitals and multiple modes exhibit ( pseudo-)jahn - teller physics",
    ". these may show rectifying behavior @xcite , dynamical symmetry breaking @xcite and current suppression due to berry phase effects  @xcite .",
    "finally , distinctive transport signatures of the breakdown of the born - oppenheimer separation  @xcite and correlations of vibration- and spin - properties have been predicted , such as a vibration - induced spin - blockade  @xcite .    since the complicated transport processes in smts may result in a suppression of single - electron tunneling , it becomes more urgent to understand the effect of higher order tunnel processes .",
    "even more so since experimentally smts typically exhibit a significant tunnel coupling .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to set up a general method to properly describe _ all _ coherent tunnel processes in leading and next - to - leading order in the tunneling hamiltonian .",
    "the method applies to very general molecular quantum dot models , with many quantized excitations and few relevant selection rules for transport quantities .",
    "additionally , all molecular interactions included in the model , for instance coulomb charging and electron - vibration , are accounted for exactly by from the outset formulating the transport equations in the basis of many - body eigenstates of the molecular hamiltonian .",
    "the non - linear transport is obtained using the explicitly calculated non - equilibrium density _",
    "matrix_. a variety of next - to - leading order effects have been discussed previously .",
    "for instance , a well known signature of higher order tunneling processes is the appearance of inelastic cotunneling steps in the differential conductance , the position of which are independent of the gate voltage , which have been observed in many experiments on semi - conductor and molecular quantum - dots  @xcite .",
    "additional gate - voltage dependent transport resonances have been found inside the coulomb blockade regime  @xcite and discussed theoretically  @xcite .",
    "these resonances are due to sequential tunneling events starting from states excited by inelastic cotunneling processes ( `` heating the molecule '' ) , called cotunneling - assisted sequential tunneling ( coset ) .",
    "it was recently suggested  @xcite that these resonances can be used to experimentally estimate the decay - rate of vibrational excitations due to a coupling to a dissipative environment .",
    "indeed , by extending the golden - rule approach by a next - to - leading order expansion of the t - matrix in the tunneling , it was found  @xcite that the coset features are particularly pronounced in the anderson - holstein model in the limit of large electron - vibration coupling . finally , effects of electron pair - tunneling were discussed  @xcite for an effective anderson model with attractive electron - electron interaction in the golden - rule approach using a schrieffer - wolff transformation .",
    "the method set up here captures all the aforementioned effects simultaneously . by providing a microscopic derivation",
    "we overcome some drawbacks of the methods employed in the cited works , related to accounting for broadening and renormalization of the molecular resonances , which were previously discussed in e.g.  @xcite , see also ref .",
    "the main focus of the paper is therefore on the general aspects of the transport theory . as a central result we present explicit kinetic equations from which the full molecular density matrix and transport current can be calculated .",
    "we reformulate the real - time transport theory  @xcite using liouville super - operators to present a straight - forward derivation .",
    "the expressions for the transport rates are valid for a wide class of quantum - dot systems and , importantly , involve no assumptions on model - specific selection rules .",
    "we show that in such higher order calculations it is crucial to include contributions from coherent superpositions of molecular states not protected by selection rules , even when the level spacing is much _ larger _ than the tunneling broadening .",
    "the anderson - holstein model with a large vibrational frequency compared to the tunneling coupling , @xmath1 , presents a case where this is extremely important and we demonstrate our method for this model .",
    "this is in clear contrast to lowest order perturbation theory where these so - called non - secular terms can be neglected .",
    "we are not aware of previous works pointing this out .    to maintain readability , the paper is divided into three parts : a general part  [ sec : model ] , application  [ sec : anderson - holstein ] and technical appendices . in sect .",
    "[ sec : model ] we shortly describe the general model of a molecular quantum dot system and the basic equations of the real - time transport theory .",
    "we then discuss the central results , the explicit transport equations for the full density matrix and transport current .",
    "detailed derivations and expressions are presented in a coherent way in the appendices for the theoretically interested reader . in sect .",

    "the entire system is described by the hamiltonian @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 the hamiltonians are written from the outset in a form which deviates from that commonly used .",

    "it cancels with an extra fermion sign appearing when disentangling the dot and reservoir operators , using that an equal number of creation and annihilation operators must occur to give a non - zero average , see ref .",
    "@xcite for a proof .",
    "we can therefore discard the sign @xmath21 from the outset , and everywhere treat dot and lead operators as commuting , greatly simplifying the calculation of signs .",
    "a microscopic molecular system coupled to macroscopic reservoirs is completely described by its reduced density operator @xmath34 , obtained by averaging the total density operator over the reservoir degrees of freedom , @xmath35 .",
    "the reduced density operator evolves in time according to a quantum kinetic equation .",
    "the presence of strong non - equilibrium effects ( non - linear transport ) and strong local interactions ( coulomb , electron - vibration , etc . ) makes the calculation of the transport rates occurring in this equation a cumbersome task . here",

    "the real - time transport theory , developed in  @xcite and extended by several groups  @xcite , provides straightforward rules for the calculation of the transport rates using a diagrammatic representation on the keldysh contour , avoiding any spurious regularization problems .",
    "this technique has been simplified further by using special liouville super - operators and corresponding diagrams in the context of a non - equilibrium renormalization group approach  @xcite . for clarity",
    "we discuss the general aspects here , whereas the important but cumbersome expressions are coherently derived and presented in the appendices .",
    "the starting point is the time evolution of the density operator of the total system , molecule + reservoirs : @xmath39 here the liouvillian super - operators in @xmath40 , act on an arbitrary operator @xmath41 by forming a commutator with the hamiltonian , e.g. @xmath42 $ ] .",

    "of course , the finite temperature must be chosen sufficiently large compared to the tunneling couplings ( @xmath78 ) to avoid the breakdown of perturbation theory .",
    "for the solution of the kinetic equation it is important to know whether the molecular density matrix is diagonal in certain quantum numbers due to a conservation law .",

    "[ sec : anderson - holstein ] the conservation of total spin - projection , @xmath83 , leads to a density matrix which is diagonal in the spin - projection of the molecule , @xmath84 .      the solution of equations  ( [ eq : master_equation_rho]-[eq : master_equation_i ] ) with perturbatively calculated kernels ( up to a finite order ) for the _ full _ molecular density matrix requires some care for models with excited states and tunnel matrix elements without strict selection rules .",
    "the present section is therefore devoted to deriving the correct and well - behaved master equations in next - to - leading order perturbation theory .",
    "first we rewrite the equations by collecting the elements of the density operator into a vector , @xmath85 , and the elements of the rate super - operators into matrices @xmath86 acting on this vector .",

    "models for molecular transistors with discrete vibrational modes , such as the anderson - holstein model , satisfy this condition , provided that the vibrational level - spacing is larger than the tunneling coupling , since spin - selection rules generally prohibit coherence between the degenerate spin - states , unless broken by e.g. magnetic anisotropy or spin - polarization of the electrodes .",
    "one can always eliminate the non - diagonal elements and incorporate their effect in a correction to the rates coupling diagonal elements . to this end",

    "due to the clear separation of energy scales ( non - degenerate spectrum ) we can expand in the small quantity @xmath102 . consistently neglecting terms of order @xmath103",
    "we then obtain an effective equation for @xmath94 : @xmath104 @xmath105 the diagonal elements of the density matrix ( vector of probabilities ) thus satisfy what looks like a classical rate - equation , but with the _ effective rates _  ( [ eq : effective_rate ] ) . a completely analogous calculation for the correction to the current from non - diagonal elements gives @xmath106 @xmath107 it can easily be shown that  ( [ eq : effective_rate ] ) and  ( [ eq : effective_current ] ) are real , ensuring that the diagonal elements of the density matrix as well as the current are real . due to eq .",

    "they scale in the same way as processes described by @xmath114 when one uniformly reduces the tunneling matrix elements .",
    "finally , we have found by numerical calculations for several model systems that partial cancellations between the non - diagonal correction terms and diagonal 4th order terms are crucial for obtaining a physical result : if these corrections are excluded one obtains set - like resonances in the coulomb - blockade regime _ below _ the inelastic cotunneling threshold .",
    "these are artifacts due to incorrect , large occupations of the excited states , even at zero bias voltage .",
    "depending on the parameters of the model , negative occupation probabilities may even result , particularly when the tunneling amplitudes  ( [ eq : tmeplus]-[eq : tmeminus ] ) vary strongly from state to state .",

    "cotunneling processes starting from the excited states now give a significant contribution to the current which slowly increases with voltage .",
    "as one approaches the threshold for coset from below , the current sharply increases as relaxation of these excited states into the @xmath163 states by sequential tunneling ( black arrow ) becomes energetically allowed with large set rates .",
    "if the fc - blockade is not fully developed , a sequential tunneling process starting from @xmath163 into the @xmath165 ground state may now follow with a larger rate than the inelastic cotunneling rate depleting the ground state , _ enhancing _ its occupation .",
