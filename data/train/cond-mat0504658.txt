    "among magnetic molecules spin rings constitute a rich subgroup of highly symmetric species of various sizes which are comprising a large variety of paramagnetic ions @xcite .",
    "the investigation of these regular structures led to a deeper understanding especially of antiferromagnetically coupled spin systems .",
    "one of the findings is the discovery and confirmation of rotational bands , see e.g. @xcite .    in accord with these investigations",
    "it was anticipated that spin rings , which host an odd number of spins or spins of different size , would show complementary quantum effects that would be interesting on their own .",
    "odd membered rings for instance would violate the presuppositions for the theorems of lieb , schultz , and mattis @xcite and thus possess non - trivial ground states as well as low - lying excited states @xcite with quantum numbers and degeneracies that differ from those of their bipartite , i.e. even - membered counterparts .",
    "the nel - like local magnetization which in even - membered rings results from a superposition of the singlet ground state and the @xmath1-component of the first excited triplet state @xcite would in odd - membered rings assume the form of a topological soliton @xcite that equally well could be pictured as a mbius strip @xcite .",
    "although it is rather difficult to synthesize homometallic odd - membered rings , the prospects of interesting features due to frustration nevertheless fuel future efforts to synthesize odd rings .    in the case of spin ring systems comprising ions of different chemical elements",
    "the breakthrough was already achieved with the synthesis of heterometallic mcr@xmath0 wheels @xcite , where one of the chromium ions of the original cr@xmath2 ring @xcite is replaced by another element m = mn , fe , co , ni , cu , zn , and cd .",
    "the possibility of a systematic study has initiated first investigations on these compounds as there are susceptibility measurements @xcite as well as neutron scattering on mncr@xmath0 , zncr@xmath0 , and nicr@xmath0 wheels @xcite .    in this article",
    "we reexamine earlier susceptibility measurements @xcite by means of complete diagonalization ( sec .",
    "[ sec-2 ] ) in the framework of an isotropic heisenberg model .",
    "our results agree with first estimates given in ref .",
    "@xcite with the noticeable difference that we find that the exchange parameters of the iron ion to its neighboring chromium ions in the fecr@xmath0 wheel is rather different from the original chromium - chromium exchange whereas it remains practically unchanged for the other paramagnetic ions @xcite .    in a second step ( sec .",
    "[ sec-3 ] ) we investigate the principle structure of the proton spin - lattice relaxation rate @xmath3 as a function of the applied magnetic field strength at low temperatures .",
    "this quantity can be probed by nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) .",
    "nmr has shown to be a powerful tool to investigate the local spin dynamics in magnetic molecules especially in the vicinity of level crossings @xcite . the relaxation rate @xmath3 is expected to increase drastically whenever two levels approach each other due to possible resonant energy exchange with the surrounding protons .",
    "in contrast to this expectation it appears that cucr@xmath0 and nicr@xmath0 show an unexpectedly reduced relaxation rate at certain level crossings which should experimentally be observable .",
    "the article closes with a summary and an outlook in sec .",
    "[ sec-5 ] .",
    "the hamilton operator of the isotropic heisenberg model for heterometallic mcr@xmath0 wheels is given by @xmath4 @xmath5 denotes the exchange parameter between nearest neighbor chromium ions whereas @xmath6 denotes the exchange parameters between the dopant and the two neighboring chromium ions .",
    "we chose @xmath7 for antiferromagnetic interaction in this article .    neglecting anisotropy the hamiltonian commutes with the square @xmath8 and the @xmath9-component @xmath10 of the total spin .",
    "in addition point group symmetries can usually be exploited . in the following cases of heterometallic mcr@xmath0 wheels",
    "only the mirror symmetry about the dopant is used .",
    "then for not too large subspaces all energy eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be computed .",
    "and @xmath11 as a function of temperature @xmath12 for cucr@xmath13 : the experimental data are given by black stars .",
    "the theoretical fit is depicted by a solid curve for @xmath14  k ; @xmath15  t and @xmath16.,width=226 ]     and @xmath11 as a function of temperature @xmath12 for zncr@xmath13 : the experimental data are given by black squares .",
    "the theoretical fit is depicted by a solid curve for@xmath17  k and @xmath18  k ; @xmath15  t and @xmath16.,width=226 ]     and @xmath11 as a function of temperature @xmath12 for nicr@xmath13 : the experimental data are presented as black diamonds .",
    "the theoretical fit for @xmath19  k is given by a solid curve and for @xmath20  k and @xmath21  k by a dashed curve .",
    "@xmath15  t and @xmath22.,width=226 ]    reexamining the available experimental susceptibility data @xcite in terms of complete numerical diagonalization of hamiltonian ( [ e-2 - 1 ] ) we find the same qualitative behavior as in ref .",
    "@xcite . depending on the spin of the dopant",
    "the resulting ground state spin @xmath23 assumes the following values : @xmath24 for m = fe , @xmath25 for m = cu , @xmath24 for m = ni , and @xmath26 for m = zn , compare also @xcite .",
    "the susceptibility @xmath27 as well as @xmath11 of cucr@xmath0 , zncr@xmath0 , nicr@xmath0 , and fecr@xmath0 are shown in figures  [ f - c ]  -  [ f - b ] .",
    "for the theoretical fits a @xmath28-value of @xmath22 has been used for nicr@xmath13 , in all other cases @xmath16 has been assumed .     and @xmath11 as a function of temperature @xmath12 for fecr@xmath13 : the experimental data are depicted by black triangles . the theoretical fit for @xmath29  k",
    "is given by a dashed curve and for @xmath30  k and @xmath31 by a solid curve .",
    "@xmath15  t and @xmath16.,width=226 ]    all susceptibility curves are compatible with antiferromagnetic exchange . in the first example of cucr@xmath0 , fig .",
    "[ f - c ] , a common exchange interaction explains the experimental data .",
    "this exchange is practically the same as in cr@xmath2 @xcite , thus unchanged in the heterometallic compound .",
    "the second example of zncr@xmath0 , fig .",
    "[ f - d ] , constitutes a spin chain since the zn ion is diamagnetic .",
    "the original cr - cr interaction is not altered whereas the coupling to the zn ion is @xmath18 . the third example deals with nicr@xmath0 , fig .",
    "[ f - e ] . here",
    "we find that the experimental data can either be described by a common but slightly reduced exchange interaction or by an almost unchanged cr - cr interaction and a 10  % smaller cr - ni exchange .",
    "this has also been reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , whereas ref .",
    "@xcite favors a 15  % bigger @xmath6 .",
    "the last example of fecr@xmath0 , fig .",
    "[ f - b ] , shows the biggest deviation from the assumption of a common and almost unchanged exchange parameter .",
    "although a single exchange constant provides a reasonable fit to the experimental data @xcite , a better approximation  especially at low temperatures  is given if one assumes that the cr - cr exchange is not much altered whereas the cr - fe exchange is reduced to half the size of the cr - cr exchange .",
    "having determined the heisenberg exchange parameters of several heterometallic mcr@xmath0 wheels we investigate how the rather different structures of low - lying levels of the various rings expresses itself in proton spin - lattice relaxation rates as would be measured by nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) .",
    "following the general theory of nuclear relaxation @xcite we determine the inverse relaxation time @xmath3 from spin - spin correlation functions as @xmath32 here @xmath33 denotes the nuclear lamor frequency , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are energy eigenvalues of hamiltonian ( [ e-2 - 1 ] ) augmented by a zeeman term .",
    "the operators @xmath36 are given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 are the usual geometrical factors of the dipolar interaction , @xmath41 .",
    "@xmath42 and @xmath43 are the polar coordinates of the vector @xmath44 describing the relative positions of the two spins . in the following",
    "we assume an isotropic case with @xmath45=0 and @xmath46=1 .",
    "@xmath47 and @xmath48 are the gyromagnetic ratios of the electronic and nuclear spins , respectively .",
    "the spin - lattice relaxation is a resonant process @xcite which ideally should only occur if the transition energy @xmath49 in the spin system matches the nuclear lamor frequency .",
    "nevertheless , the interaction of the whole system with its surrounding broadens levels . in addition the experimental resolution is limited .",
    "we therefore allow transitions which deviate up to @xmath50 from strict energy conservation .",
    "this is taken care of by a gaussian distribution function @xmath51 .",
    "this function could in principle depend both on temperature and on applied field @xcite",
    ". we will neglect such possible dependencies and use the same function with @xmath52  k for all calculations .",
    "the interested reader is referred to refs .",
    "@xcite , where possible temperature and field dependencies are discussed .    .",
    "the crossing fields are highlighted and the values of the two lowest fields given .",
    "bottom panel : @xmath53-magnetization ( steps ) and relaxation rate @xmath3 as function of the applied field normalized to the coupling @xmath54.,width=264 ]    the spin - lattice relaxation of the mother substance cr@xmath2 has been investigated in great detail @xcite , but predominantly as a function of temperature for certain small applied magnetic fields . in the following",
    "we discuss the behavior of the relaxation rate as a function of magnetic field for a typical small temperature of @xmath55  k @xcite .",
    "this function highlights the behavior of the magnetic system at low - lying ( dominantly ground state ) zeeman level crossings , since there resonant cross relaxation occurs .",
    "experimentally such data are rarely accessible due to the fact that often the level crossing fields are outside the producible field range . in the case of cr@xmath2 @xcite and fe@xmath56",
    "@xcite these data could nevertheless be measured thanks to moderate exchange constants .",
    "one important result of these measurements is that the values of the level crossing fields for even - membered heisenberg rings follow the land interval rule @xcite , which is nowadays understood as rotational modes @xcite , rotation of the nel vector @xcite or tower of states @xcite .    .",
    "the crossing fields are highlighted and the values of the two lowest fields given .",

    "[ f - k ] ) , cucr@xmath0 ( fig .  [ f - i ] ) , and nicr@xmath0 ( fig .",
