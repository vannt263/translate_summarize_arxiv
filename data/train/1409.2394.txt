    "let us consider three superconductors @xmath12 with voltages @xmath13 and @xmath14 , connected by a short metallic link or a quantum ( double ) dot ( figure [ bijunction ] ) . defining the phases @xmath15 , @xmath16 , the total free energy at equilibrium ( @xmath17 )",

    "the simplest of these multipair processes involves quartets , e.g. @xmath32 .",
    "it is important to notice that the lowest - order josephson processes taking one single pair from one to the other superconductor average to zero .    from equations ( [ currentfourier],[adiabatic ] )",
    ", one finds that a d.c .",
    "multipair current in @xmath19 appears : @xmath33 this shows the relevance of the phase combination @xmath34 which controls coherent d.c .",

    "this phase can be emulated either by imposing suitable fluxes in a circuit containing the bijunction , or by sending a d.c .",

    "the first method is demanding as it implies the control of two phase variables .",
    "the second one is somewhat similar to driving a current into a josephson junction and exploring its zero - voltage branch .",
    "an equivalent in the bijunction of this zero - voltage branch is a @xmath24 line in the @xmath35 plane .",
    "the above simple calculation is valid only for tunneling barriers and voltages well below the gap . yet , in this case , the quartet process which is a second order process might be weak . on the contrary , if the bijunction is metallic and has a high transparency , quartet transport can be strong and even resonant . in this case , a full nonequilibrium calculation should be performed . in what follows ,",
    "we explore two situations , first , a bijunction made of a double quantum dot , achievable with a carbon nanotoube or a nanowire , and second , with disordered long metallic junctions .",
    "recent progress on cooper pair splitting has arisen with the fabrication of hybrid @xmath36 bijunctions where the dots @xmath37 are created within a single wall carbon nanotube @xcite or a semiconducting nanowire @xcite .",
    "evidence for cooper pair splitting comes out from measurement of the nonlocal conductance .",

    "for sake of simplicity , one considers one single electronic level @xmath39 in each dot .",
    "the coupling between the dots and the superconductors is supposed to be symmetric and described by the level broadening @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the normal metal density of states in the superconductors and @xmath42 is a dot - superconductor hopping parameter .",
    "the adiabatic argument of section 2 suggests that the multipair current depends on the phase combination @xmath43 .",
    "the calculation of the current - phase characteristics is performed using nonequilibrium keldysh green s functions @xcite .",

    "the results for the largest resonances are represented on figure [ fig : metallic ] and compared to the phase - independent part of the quasiparticle current .",
    "one sees that the multipair features appear as strong resonances .",
    "the quartet dispersion has a negative slope at the origin and is thus a @xmath48-junction in terms of the `` quartet phase '' @xmath49 .",
    "this is due to the exchange process occurring as two split cooper pairs are emitted by @xmath27 and recombine into one pair in @xmath19 and one in @xmath28 .",

    "the maximum current increases by several orders of magnitude and is maximum when @xmath53 .",
    "moreover , above the maximum , currents @xmath26 and @xmath54 start to depart from each other , signalling the onset of a strong mar quasiparticle current . remarkably , this mar current is phase - dependent , a specific feature of the resonant quartet behaviour , which can be ascribed to interferences between various amplitudes within the bijunction ( figure [ fig : procmixtes ] ) .",
    "this calculation validates the existence of quartet and higher - order resonances featuring a d.c .",
    "current of correlated cooper pairs .",
    "these currents are functions of a well - defined combination of the phases , that becomes a relevant and observable variable .",

    "one should underline that instead of andreev bound states forming in a junction at equilibrium , here the d.c .",
    "josephson - like multipair resonances are due to andreev _ resonances _ , and they coexist with dissipative mar channels .",
    "this coexistence is a novel feature in superconductivity . as a corollary , the maximum `` critical '' quartet current depends on the applied voltage , in a dramatic way in the example shown above ( section 3.2 )",
    "copper and aluminum bijunctions have been fabricated @xcite by shadow mask evaporation technique @xcite , leading to highly transparent and uniform sn interfaces .",
    "they form three - terminal junctions with a t - shape normal conductor connecting three superconducting electrodes @xmath55 and @xmath28 ( figure [ measurement ] ) .",
    "the width and length of the normal metal are about @xmath56 and @xmath57 . using a diffusion constant for copper @xmath58 ,",
    "one gets a thouless energy @xmath59 .",
    "the superconducting al energy gap is @xmath60 .",
    "these josephson junctions are thus in the long junction regime defined as the thouless energy @xmath61 being much smaller than the gap @xmath5 , or equivalently a junction length @xmath62 larger than the superconductor coherence length @xmath63 .",
    "the diffusion time is @xmath64 is much smaller than the inelastic time @xmath65 at @xmath66 .    ]",
    "three - terminal differential resistances were measured using a specific experimental set - up including 3 squids as current amplifiers ( figure [ measurement ] ) @xcite . the differential resistance @xmath67 is plotted as a 2d map in the @xmath35 plane ( figure [ tri ] ) .",
    "first , it displays anomalies along the axis , that correspond to the `` direct '' josephson effect between @xmath27 and @xmath19 or @xmath28 ( the one between @xmath19 and @xmath28 is not visible due to the location of the ac lock - in ) .",
    "second , clear features appear at voltage values such as @xmath68 , where @xmath69 , corresponding to quartets emitted respectively by @xmath70 .",
    "the transversal @xmath71 traces shown in figure [ traces ] display comparable shape and amplitude with respect to the josephson features obtained at @xmath72 or @xmath73 .",
    "an explanation in terms of the synchronization of ac josephson oscillations in junctions @xmath74 and @xmath75 @xcite is unlikely , since in the experimental regime where @xmath76 is as large as @xmath77 , ac josephson oscillations should be strongly decreased .",
    "in addition , the amplitude of the anomalies is nearly independent of the voltage value , pointing towards a fully coherent phenomenon .",
    "figure [ quartet ] indeed shows why the quartet mechanism is immune against the decoherence brought by such voltage in a single josephson junction .",
    "two andreev reflections in @xmath27 produce two splitted cooper pairs , materializing in electrons and holes at energies @xmath78 in the @xmath79 branch , and at energies @xmath80 in the @xmath81 branch .",
    "provided @xmath82 , such energies allow recombination by andreev reflection at @xmath19 and @xmath28 , without any loss of coherence introduced by the voltage .",
    "this coherent process has the structure of a mar process , but in the present case it is energy conserving and it provides a josephson - like quartet channel .    ]",
    "a perturbative non - equilibrium green s function @xcite calculations gives the following estimate for the maximum quartet current :    @xmath83    where the characteristic phase dependence of the quartet mode stems from the four involved andreev reflections , one at @xmath19 , one at @xmath28 and two at @xmath27 .",
    "the conductance @xmath84 is the crossed andreev conductance of a @xmath85 structure in which the electrodes @xmath19 and @xmath28 are in the normal state and at voltages @xmath86 . by `` car conductance ''",
    "we mean the conductance formally associated to a process in which an electron from @xmath87 , at energy @xmath76 is transmitted as a hole in @xmath88 at energy @xmath89 , and a cooper pair is therefore split from @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "this formula is similar to the one for a sns junction where the _ pair _ critical current @xmath90 is related to the single particle normal conductance and the thouless energy sets the coherence of andreev reflection .",
    "the car conductance can be evaluated as @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the conductance within each normal branch of the bijunction , and @xmath93 is the normal - state conductance of a region of size @xmath94 of the superconductor @xmath27 ( @xmath95 is the channel number ) .",
    "this shows that the ratio between the quartet maximum current at a bias @xmath45 and the single junction critical current at zero bias is @xmath96 , which is not necessarily small .",
    "based on measured sample parameters , we estimate this ratio to @xmath97 , in fair agreement with the experiment . notice that if @xmath98 , then @xmath84 as well as @xmath99 do not decrease with @xmath45 , in agreement with the present experiment .",
    "the theory and the experiment reported here open the way to a new kind of josephson devices .",
    "phase coherence is possible between three superconductors biased at suitable voltages , and open new channels for transport , made of correlated cooper pairs .",
    "such phase coherence remains to be demonstrated by interference experiments . beyond the understanding and probing of the microscopic properties of such bijunctions ( made of quantum dots or metals ) ,",
    "future prospects include the exploration of new entanglement properties , and the production of phase - correlated microwave fields .",
