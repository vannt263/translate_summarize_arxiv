    "observations in the last decade have shown that the mean size of massive ( @xmath3 ) galaxies evolves with redshift ( @xmath4 ) ; that is , these galaxies have , at a fixed stellar mass , a smaller size at higher redshifts .",
    "the size evolution is more dramatic for early - type galaxies ( etgs ) than for late - type galaxies ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereinafter ) .",
    "in fact , at @xmath4 @xmath5 2 a large number of massive etg galaxies have sizes , as parametrized by the effective radius , of @xmath51 kpc .",
    "these objects have been termed massive compact galaxies in the literature .",
    "only a few of these galaxies have been found in the nearby universe ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    with the increasing availability of velocity dispersion measurements for massive compact galaxies",
    ", it has become apparent that dynamical masses , estimated using the virial relationship @xmath0 , often turn out to be lower than stellar masses .",
    "this occurs at low as well as at high redshifts . @xcite and",
    "@xcite found this problem for two galaxies at @xmath4 @xmath5 0.5 and for four galaxies at @xmath4 @xmath5 1 , respectively .",
    "@xcite report the same result for seven massive compact galaxies in the nearby universe ( @xmath4 @xmath5 0.14 ) .",
    "as the inequality @xmath12 is unphysical , it follows that , for these objects , either the dynamical masses are underestimated or the stellar masses are overestimated .",
    "both conditions could of course apply simultaneously .",
    "stellar mass determinations are based on the comparison of galaxy spectral energy distributions ( seds ) with synthetic spectra of stellar populations built using the current knowledge of stellar spectra , stellar evolution , the initial mass function ( imf ) , star formation history and dust attenuation .",
    "it is believed that the uncertainty in these parameters can lead to an error in the estimation of the stellar mass by factors of up to 24 @xcite .",
    "the comparison with stellar synthesis models can be carried out using broad - band photometric data , and hence this method provides an efficient means of estimating stellar masses for galaxies at high - redshift .",
    "several techniques are available to derive dynamical masses .",
    "the most accurate methods are based on one of two approaches : the solution of poisson and jeans equations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or the description of the system using an orbit - superposition method @xcite .",
    "these methods require high - quality two - dimensional spectroscopic data , making them expensive in observing time . a cheaper alternative , and the only one available today for high - redshift galaxies , is to use simpler mass estimators based on the virial theorem . following the notation in @xcite ,",
    "we write the virial theorem as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the gravitational constant , @xmath15 the gravitational radius of the system , @xmath16 is twice the kinetic energy of the system per unit mass , and @xmath17 is the virialization constant .",
    "@xmath17 has the value @xmath18 when the system is virialized .",
    "unfortunately , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are not direct observables .",
    "for this reason , it is common to define two coefficients , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , which connect these magnitudes with direct observables that provide galactic length and velocity scales respectively ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) .",
    "these coefficients are defined by the following equalities : @xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath19 and @xmath20 are coefficients describing the spatial and dynamical structure of the objects , respectively . using equations  ( [ eq : k_r ] ) and ( [ eq : k_v ] ) , it is straightforward to express the virial theorem ( equation  [ eq : virial ] ) in terms of observables : @xmath25 where we have defined @xmath7 as @xmath26 the coefficient @xmath7 will be a universal constant only if the coefficients @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the same for all etgs ( or if their dependences disappear in their product ) .",
    "this hypothesis is known as homology , because it would be verified if all etgs had the same mass density , and kinematic and luminosity structures . following these ideas ,",
    "@xcite selected the effective ( half - light ) radius @xmath27  and the luminosity - weighted second moment @xmath28  of the line - of - sight velocity distribution ( losvd ) within @xmath27  to play the role of observables @xmath21 and @xmath22 ; that is , they used the following equation : @xmath29 using a sample of nearby and normal - sized etgs , these authors found that @xmath7 is approximately constant and they proposed the following calibration as a reliable estimator of the dynamical mass for an etg : @xmath30 this formula is used in the references mentioned above that lead to the reported discrepancy between dynamical and stellar masses .",
    "hereinafter , we will always use the term dynamical mass to refer to the mass calculated using equation  ( [ eq : virial - cap ] ) .    in this work we characterized the fraction @xmath9 at various redshifts and covering various regions of the mass  size space .",
    "we used this information to determine in which areas of this parameter space the mass predictions produce the impossible result @xmath12 .",
    "our paper is structured as follows . in section  [ sec : data ] , we present a description of our sample and additional sources of data .",
    "we describe the processing of spectra and velocity dispersion measurements of our sample in section  [ sec : processing ] . in section  [ sec : discrepancy ] , we show our results for @xmath9 and argue that @xmath1  uncertainties alone can not explain values of @xmath2 .",
    "we interpret the discrepancy as a non - homology effect in section  [ sec : interpretation ] . in section  [ sec : discussion ]",
    "we discuss about our results .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in section  [ sec : conclusions ] . we adopt a @xmath31cdm cosmology with @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the stellar masses are obtained assuming a salpeter imf ( we applied a conversion factor when necessary following the prescriptions from @xcite ) .",
    "our targets belong to the catalogue of massive galaxies studied by .",
    "this catalogue contains 796 galaxies with redshifts between 0.2 and 2 .",
    "the authors split their sample into two groups : one containing objects that have a srsic index @xmath35 @xmath36 2.5 ( disc - like galaxies ) and the other containing galaxies that have @xmath35 @xmath37 2.5 ( spheroid - like galaxies ) .",
    "this criterion is based on the correlation between the srsic index @xmath35 and the morphological type observed both in the nearby universe @xcite and in the high - redshift universe ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in this work , we focus on the spheroid - like galaxies , which are the set with a stronger size evolution .",
    "therefore , our initial catalogue contains the 463 massive galaxies with @xmath35 @xmath37 2.5 .",
    "an extra requirement we apply to this subsample is the availability of a spectrum in the unique redshift deep2 dr4 catalogue @xcite .",
    "deep2 dr4 was designed to conduct a comprehensive census of massive galaxies , and their properties , environments and large - scale structure down to an absolute magnitude @xmath38 at @xmath4 @xmath5 1 .",
    "the targets of this catalogue are located in four fields , which have a total area of 2.8 deg@xmath39 .",
    "one of these fields is the extended groth strip ( egs , * ? ? ?",
    "all the galaxies studied by are located in the egs field .",
    "this is relevant because the egs is the only field of the deep2 dr4 survey in which colour pre - selection was not applied .",
    "the cross - match between the deep2 dr4 catalogue and the spheroid - like galaxies was performed using the _ objno _ index on the first and the _ galaxy identification _ on the second .",
    "both indices come from the sample defined by @xcite .",
    "the number of matches is 260 .",
    "other requirements were applied to this set in order to avoid contaminant objects .",
    "two targets were rejected for being too small to be reliable ( they had a semimajor axis equal to 0.01 arcsec and an effective radius @xmath50.01 kpc ) .",
    "we also required our galaxies to have a secure redshift , namely galaxies with quality codes equal to 3 or 4 in the deep2 dr4 catalogue . only in two cases was the difference between the redshift used by ( @xmath40 ) and the secure redshift published by deep2 dr4 ( @xmath4 ) was significant ; that is , it was not the case that @xmath41 @xmath36 8 per cent , 0.89 @xmath36 @xmath42 @xmath36 1.15 and @xmath43 @xmath36 13 per cent .",
    "these two targets were rejected . with these extra requirements ,",
    "our final catalogue comprised 243 sources .        in fig .",
    "[ fig : t07deep2-cross - matching ] we plot the information from the cross - match between the two catalogues in the stellar mass  size diagram .",
    "it can be seen that our sample is restricted to @xmath40 @xmath36 1.4 .",
    "in the three lower redshift bins , most of the points satisfy our requirements , but this is not the case in the @xmath40 @xmath5 1.25 bin . a relevant fact that we can check in fig .  [",
    "fig : t07deep2-cross - matching ] is that there are no biases affecting the stellar mass  size distribution in the three lower redshift bins .",
    "we summarize here the parameters that we will use throughout this work , detailing in each case whether the parameter was extracted from the deep2 dr4 or the catalogue , or whether it was derived from a combination of parameters from both catalogues .",
    "1 .   srsic index @xmath35 : taken from the catalogue .",

    "3 .   circularized effective radius @xmath27 : effective radii in arcseconds were obtained from , and these quantities were then converted to kiloparsecs using the deep2 dr4 redshifts .",
    "we compared our effective radii in kiloparsecs with the radii ( @xmath44 ) , and checked that they were very similar , namely that they satisfied @xmath45 .",
    "stellar mass @xmath1 : this magnitude was recalculated based on the stellar masses ( @xmath46 ) and considering the deep2 dr4 redshift ( @xmath4 ) as a small correction of redshift ( @xmath40 ) . specifically , we considered that the luminosity of an object should be corrected using the equation @xmath47 ^ 2 $ ] , where @xmath48 is the updated luminosity at redshift @xmath4 , @xmath49 is the luminosity at redshift @xmath40 , and @xmath50 is the luminosity distance at redshift @xmath4 .",
    "we also assumed that the stellar mass  luminosity ratio should be very similar to that considered by for each galaxy ; that is , we used that @xmath51 .",
    "these hypotheses imply that the mass correction formula is @xmath52 ^ 2 m_{\\star\\mathrm{t07}}$ ] .",
    "we compared the updated stellar masses with stellar masses and found that the differences were small ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "individual galaxy spectra : taken from the deep2 dr4 survey .",
    "these spectra were obtained using three exposures of 20 min each with the multislit spectrograph deimos @xcite on the keck ii telescope .",
    "the observations were performed under seeing conditions between 0.5 and 1.2 arcsec .",
    "their spectral range is 65009300   , and their spectral resolution @xmath54 is 5900 at 7800   .",

    "[ fig : t07deep2-snr ] shows the mean rest - frame signal - to - noise ratio of the spectra available for each target selected in section  [ subsec : t07deep2-cross - matching ] over their stellar mass  size distribution .",
    "most galaxies are located in the three lower redshift bins . as we will use these spectra to make stacked spectra later on and to measure their velocity dispersions , we limit our present sample to targets selected in section  [ subsec : t07deep2-cross - matching ] that ( i ) have spectra with a signal - to - noise ratio greater than 5  @xmath55 , and ( ii ) have redshifts in the range @xmath56 .      in sections  [ sec :",

    "all these individual galaxies are massive ( @xmath57 ) and spheroid - like ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "we used six nearby massive compact galaxies from @xcite , four galaxies from @xcite at @xmath4 @xmath5 0.5 ( these galaxies include the two galaxies from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the four galaxies from @xcite at @xmath4 @xmath5 1 .",
    "as detailed in the introduction , a discrepancy between @xmath1  and @xmath8  has been reported for all these galaxies .",
    "we have included dynamical and stellar masses from the compilation of masses and structural parameters for high - redshift individual galaxies carried out by @xcite .",
    "this compilation was made using data from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , and it covers the redshift range from 0.9 to 2.2 .",
    "we also took 32 massive spheroid - like galaxies from the recent work by @xcite with redshifts between 1.0 and 1.6 .",

    "these authors have provided us with the mean values of individual stellar masses and redshifts .",
    "furthermore , @xcite kindly provided us with tabulated values of mean sizes , redshifts and velocity dispersions used in their paper ( except for their highest - redshift data point , where the mean velocity dispersion is the velocity dispersion on a stacked spectra ) . in this case , we assigned a mean dynamical mass to each data value , introducing the mean values of radius and velocity dispersion in equation  ( [ eq : virial - cap ] ) .",
    "finally , we added a sample of 53  571 galaxies from the nyu value - added galaxy catalog dr7 ( hereinafter nyu sdss sample , or the nyu sample of sdss galaxies ) .",
    "these galaxies were selected using the following criteria : they are massive ( @xmath59 ) , spheroid - like ( @xmath35 @xmath37 2.5 ) , and close to the peak of the redshift distribution of the sdss catalogue ( 0.05 @xmath36 @xmath4 @xmath36 0.11 ) . to avoid unreliable data , we applied extra restrictions to the sdss sample : reliable velocity dispersions , physical radii and apparent sizes , namely @xmath60 , 0.3 @xmath61  @xmath36 @xmath27  @xmath36 30 @xmath61 , and @xmath27  @xmath37 1 arcsec .",
    "the last condition is applied to ensure that the apparent sizes are larger than the average full width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) ground - based data .",

    "fig : m_star / m_dyn*k - r / r_shen ] , equation  ( [ eq : mdyn - prediction ] ) has corrected the dominant factor , namely compactness , by positing a shallow dependence of @xmath8  on radius ( @xmath119 ) .",

    "conversely , when the baryon density is significantly lower than the dark matter density ( @xmath121 ) , equation  ( [ eq : mdyn - prediction ] ) should be considered as a lower limit to the dynamical mass .",
    "it is possible to devise corrections to equation  ( [ eq : mdyn - prediction ] ) if independent information on the behaviour of @xmath9 is available .",
    "a question that arises is whether in massive compact galaxies the ratio @xmath9 ( within @xmath51 @xmath27 ) significantly departs from the value @xmath102 found by @xcite .",
    "two - dimensional spectroscopy of compact galaxies , followed by dynamical modelling , will provide the answer to this question .",
    "our guess is that , if anything , @xmath9 within the luminous effective radius is higher in an ultra - dense galaxy than in a normal galaxy , given the strongly dissipative processes that must occur in order for the galaxies to reach their high densities . under this hypothesis , equation  ( [ eq : mdyn - prediction ] ) should provide a good approximation to the dynamical mass .",
    "the family of etgs may depart from homology ( non - constant @xmath7 in equation  [ eq : virial - rsigma ] ) through differences in their internal structure , their internal dynamics and/or the contribution of dark matter to their gravitational potential .",
    "structural non - homology is expected , given that the surface brightness profiles of etgs show a range of srsic indices @xmath35 ; provide the dependence of @xmath7 on @xmath35 .",
    "the internal dynamical structure of massive compact galaxies is also expected to differ from that of normal - sized massive galaxies : while the formation of massive compact galaxies must have involved a strongly dissipative collapse , normal - sized @xmath106 massive ellipticals owe their internal dynamics to a history of dissipationless mergers ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "minor mergers , thought to be the dominant mechanism for the size evolution of massive compact galaxies , imply non - violent relaxation that leaves the remnant in a state far from equipartition per unit mass , whereas mixing is more pronounced in major mergers .",
    "a further clue that the internal dynamics of massive compact galaxies differs from that of normal - sized ellipticals is provided by the fact that these objects show elongated shapes @xcite ; that is , they have disc - like shapes . at high redshifts ,",
    "this has been confirmed by @xcite and @xcite among others .",
    "this fact may suggest an increase of the rotational contribution to the dynamical structure of these objects @xcite .    we emphasize that our arguments leading to a conclusion of non - homology would be compromised if stellar mass estimates were shown to have large , systematic errors that scale with galaxy compactness .",
    "it remains , therefore , to seek clues on non - homology that are independent of stellar mass determinations , using deep two - dimensional spectroscopy of nearby massive compact galaxies to constrain jeans or schwarzschild modelling ( for example , it would be interesting to undertake a detailed study of the objects in * ? ? ?",
    "in what follows we summarize the main results of this paper .",
    "first , the degree to which the ratio of stellar to dynamical masses is unphysical ( @xmath2 ) is related to the compactness of the galaxies , not to redshift ( figs  [ fig : m_star / m_dyn - z ] and [ fig : m_star / m_dyn - r / r_shen ] ) . for most compact galaxies ,",
    "the mass discrepancy is too large to be caused by the uncertainties in the imf , arguably the weakest point in the determination of the total mass of a stellar population .",
    "other uncertainties in the stellar mass determination can not lead to a reconciliation of the two mass estimators either .",
    "the disagreement is too large to be explained by a variation in the dark matter fraction .",
    "therefore , either ( i ) there exists an unknown large _",
    "systematic _ error in stellar masses linked to galaxy compactness , or ( ii ) there is a violation of the homology hypothesis in massive compact galaxies .",
    "second , when we interpret the @xmath1@xmath8  discrepancy in terms of non - homology , namely as a variation of the coefficient @xmath7 from the virial theorem ( equation  [ eq : virial - rsigma ] ) , the value of @xmath7 reaches up to @xmath540 for several compact galaxies ( eight times greater than the value found by @xcite ) .",
    "this strong variation in @xmath7 is well modelled as @xmath122 with @xmath123 .    finally , owing to the dependence of @xmath7 on @xmath27  and @xmath1 , the dynamical mass scales with @xmath28  and @xmath27  as @xmath124 , hence departing from homology and the virial theorem - based scaling @xmath118 .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : mdyn - prediction ] ) provides an approximation to estimate @xmath8  for galaxies with @xmath120 , and is a lower limit for galaxies strongly dominated by dark matter ( i.e. @xmath121 ) .",
