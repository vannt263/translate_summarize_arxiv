    "the bd+404124 region consists of a few tens of very young stars associated with the probable herbig ae / be stars",
    "bd+404124 (= v1685  cyg ) , lkh@xmath0 224 (= v1686  cyg ) and the young multiple system lkh@xmath0  225 (= v1318  cyg ) , all of which have infrared excesses ( strom et al .",
    "1972a ; hillenbrand et al . 1995 ) .",
    "together with ngc 6910 , ngc 6914 , the bd+413731 region and ic 1318 , it is part of the giant star forming region 2 cyg , at a distance of about 1  kpc ( shevchenko et al .",
    "the stars in the bd+404124 region are significantly younger ( ages less than 1 million years ) than those in the surrounding ob associations , with the low- and the high - mass stars having formed nearly simultaneously , leading some authors to suggest that star formation in this association might have been induced by the propagation of an external shock wave into the cloud core ( shevchenko et al .",
    "1991 ; hillenbrand et al .",
    "the iras and afgl surveys showed a powerful infrared source within the bd+404124 group , but the positional uncertainty did not allow to assign the flux to one of the individual objects in the region .",
    "more recent submm continuum maps of the region ( aspin et al . 1994 ; di francesco et al . 1997 ; henning et al .",
    "1998 ) clearly peak on lkh@xmath0 225 , suggesting that it is also dominant in the far - infrared and may be identified with iras 20187 + 4111 ( afgl 2557 ) .",
    "aspin et al . (",
    "1994 ) have shown lkh@xmath0  225 to be a triple system oriented north - south .",
    "the most northern and southern components , separated by 5 , appear stellar and are photometrically variable at optical and near - infrared wavelengths .",
    "the middle component exhibits strong [ sii ] emission , suggesting it is a nebulous knot of shock - excited material , not unlike many herbig - haro objects ( magakyan & movseyan 1997 ) . whereas bd+404124 dominates the association in the optical ,",
    "the southern component of lkh@xmath0  225 is brightest in the mid - infrared ( aspin et al .",
    "a k - band spectrum of lkh@xmath0  225-south by the same authors shows strong ro - vibrational emission lines of molecular hydrogen .",
    "aspin et al . ( 1994 ) estimate the total luminosity of this object to be @xmath2 1600  l@xmath6 , which places it in the luminosity range of the herbig ae / be stars .",
    "palla et al .",
    "( 1994 ) obtained near infrared , co , c@xmath7o , cs , and h@xmath1o maser observations of the group .",
    "their high resolution vla data show that a h@xmath1o maser source is clearly associated with lkh@xmath0  225-south .",
    "moreover , a density concentration in the molecular cloud ( as evidenced by cs  j=54 emission ) and a co outflow are both associated with lkh@xmath0  225 . in their model , lkh@xmath0  225 is at the center of a dense molecular core of mass @xmath2 280  m@xmath6 , while bd+404124 lies near the periphery .",
    "continuum radio emission has been detected from bd+404124 and a source 42  to the east of bd+404124 ( skinner et al .",
    "1993 ) .",
    "the infrared emission - line spectrum of young stellar objects ( ysos ) such as those in the bd+404124 group is dominated by the interaction of the central object with the remnants of the cloud from which it formed .",
    "if a young stellar object produces intense uv radiation , either due to accretion or because of a high temperature of the central star , an hii region will develop , producing a rich ionic emission line spectrum . at the edge of the hii region , a so - called photodissociation or photon - dominated region ( pdr ) will be created , in which neutral gas is heated by photoelectrically ejected electrons from grain surfaces .",
    "cooling of this neutral gas occurs mainly through emission in atomic fine - structure and molecular lines , allowing us to probe the physical conditions in the pdr through the study of its infrared emission - line spectrum .",
    "if the yso has a strong , often collimated , outflow , it will cause a shock wave as the outflow penetrates in the surrounding molecular cloud , heating the gas . in case",
    "the shock has a velocity smaller than @xmath2 40  km  s@xmath5 , it will not dissociate the molecular material and mainly cool through infrared molecular transitions . because the physical conditions from the pre - shock gas to the post - shock gas change gradually within such a non - dissociative shock , they are often called c(ontinuous)-shocks . for higher shock velocities , the molecules will be dissociated and cooling in the shock occurs mainly through atomic and ionic emission lines .",
    "in such a shock , the physical conditions from the pre- to the post - shock gas will change within one mean free path and therefore they are usually termed j(ump)-shocks . in the post - shock gas of a j - shock , molecules will re - form and cool down the gas further .",
    "therefore a dissociative shock will produce an infrared spectrum consisting of a combination of ionic and molecular emission lines .",
    "in this paper we present _ infrared space observatory _ ( iso ; kessler et al .",
    "1996 ) spectroscopic data obtained at the positions of bd+404124 , lkh@xmath0 224 and lkh@xmath0 225 . some of the h@xmath1 lines included in this data - set were already analyzed in a previous _ letter _ ( wesselius et al .",

    "we will re - analyze an extended set of h@xmath1 data using the latest iso calibrations , in combination with new data on infrared fine - structure lines , gas - phase molecular absorption bands and solid - state emission features in the bd+404124 group .",
    "we will show that the infrared emission lines arise from the combination of a hii region and a pdr at the position of bd+404124 , from a non - dissociative shock at the position of lkh@xmath0 224 , and from the combination of a non - dissociative and a dissociative shock at the position of lkh@xmath0 225 .",
    "we will also discuss the unusual absorption - line spectrum seen in the line of sight towards lkh@xmath0 225 and briefly discuss its implications for the physical and chemical evolution of hot cores .",

    "figure  1 shows the resulting iso spectra .",
    "plots of all detected lines , rebinned to a resolution @xmath10 of 2000 with an oversampling factor of four ( sws ) , or averaged across scans ( lws ) , are presented in figs .",
    "line fluxes for detected lines and upper limits ( total flux for line with peak flux 3@xmath11 ) for the most significant undetected lines are listed in table  2 .    for bd+404124 and lkh@xmath0 224 , all detected lines appear at their rest wavelength within the accuracy of the iso spectrometers . for lkh@xmath0 225 ,",
    "all lines in the sws spectra are systematically shifted by @xmath2 @xmath9100  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "this could either be a reflection of the real spatial velocity of lkh@xmath0 225 or be caused by a slight offset between our pointing , based on the optical position of the source , and the position of the infrared source .",
    "for all three sources , the lines are unresolved , indicating that the velocity dispersion is smaller than a few hundred km  s@xmath5 .    for each complete spectral scan ,",
    "the sws actually makes twelve different grating scans , each covering a small wavelength region ( `` sws band '' ) , and with its own optical path .",
    "they are joined to form one single spectrum ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "because of the variation of the diffraction limit of the telescope with wavelength , different sws bands use apertures of different sizes .",
    "for a source that is not point - like , one may therefore see a discontinuity in flux at the wavelengths where such a change in aperture occurs .",
    "this effect can indeed be seen in some of our spectra , indicating the presence of extended far - infrared emission throughout the region .    since both grating spectrometers on board iso use apertures that are fairly large compared to the separation of sources in most star forming regions",
    ", some caution is appropriate in interpreting such measurements .",
    "we created a plot with the positions of the sws apertures , overlaid on a k@xmath12-band image of the region ( hillenbrand et al .",
    "1995 ) , shown in fig .",
    "as can be seen from this figure , only one strong near - infrared source is included in the bd+404124 and lkh@xmath0 224 measurements , whereas the lkh@xmath0 225 measurement only includes the question - mark shaped infrared nebula formed by the point - like objects lkh@xmath0 225-north and lkh@xmath0 225-south and the bridging nebula lkh@xmath0 225-middle .",
    "iso - lws has a beam that is larger ( 6183  fwhm ) than the separation of the objects studied here .",
    "therefore the lws measurements of bd+404124 and lkh@xmath0 225 partly cover the same region .",
    "the lws spectrum of lkh@xmath0 224 shown in fig .",
    "1 is a weighted average of these spectra .",
    "accuracies of the absolute flux calibration in the sws spectra range from 7% in the short - wavelength ( @xmath13 4.10  @xmath8 m ) part to @xmath2 30% in the long wavelength ( @xmath14 29  @xmath8 m ) part ( leech et al .",
    "the lws absolute flux calibration is expected to be accurate at the 7% level ( trams et al . 1997 ) .",
    "note that the applied flux calibration is based on the assumption that we are looking at a point source .",
    "for an extended source , the diffraction losses will be underestimated and in particular at the long - wavelength part of the lws , these corrections will exceed the quoted uncertainty .",
    "a spectral energy distribution ( sed ) for bd+404124 was constructed by combining uv , optical , infrared , submm and radio data of bd+404124 from literature ( wesselius et al .",
    "1982 ; strom et al . 1972a ; terranegra et al . 1994 ; hillenbrand et al . 1992 , 1995 ; cohen 1972 ; lorenzetti et al .",
    "1983 ; di francesco et al . 1997 ; corcoran & ray 1998 ; skinner et al . 1993 ; bertout & thum 1982 ) with our new iso spectra ( fig .",
    "6a ) . as can be seen from this plot , the optical to submm photometry forms a smooth curve . at radio wavelengths",
    "the slope of the energy distribution appears significantly flatter .",
    "we interpret this sed as the sum of three components : continuum emission from the central star in the uv and optical , thermal emission from dust heated by the central star in the infrared to submm and free - free emission from the stellar wind or an hii region at cm wavelengths .",
    "the sws spectrum of bd+404124 shows a rising continuum component starting around 13  @xmath8 m .",
    "this component is not present in the infrared photometry by cohen ( 1972 ) .",
    "this could be due to the smaller aperture size or the chopping throw used for background subtraction by cohen .",
    "we interpret this second dust component , only visible in the iso data , as diffuse emission throughout the star forming region .",
    "there is general consensus in the literature that the spectral type of bd+404124 is about b2 ve+sh ( merrill et al .",
    "1932 ; herbig 1960 ; strom et al . 1972b ; swings 1981 ; finkenzeller 1985 ; hillenbrand et al .",

    "( 1972a ) we arrive at a value of @xmath17 towards the optical star .",
    "this value agrees well with the @xmath18 derived from the diffuse interstellar band at 5849  ( oudmaijer et al .",
    "1997 ) . with this @xmath18 value and assuming a normal interstellar extinction law ( i.e. @xmath19 = @xmath20 = 3.1 )",
    ", we corrected the data for extinction .    a kurucz ( 1991 ) stellar atmosphere model with @xmath15 and",
    "@xmath16 corresponding to the star s spectral type ( assuming solar abundance ) was fitted to the extinction - corrected uv to optical sed .",
    "the fit is also shown in fig .  6a .",
    "as can be seen from this figure , the sed fit is not perfect in the uv .",
    "possibly a uv excess due to a strong stellar wind is present in bd+404124 .",
    "the fitted kurucz model was used to compute an apparent stellar luminosity @xmath21 for bd+404124 , which was converted to an absolute stellar luminosity using the bd+404124 distance estimate of 1  kpc by shevchenko et al .",
    "infrared luminosities were computed by fitting a spline to the infrared to mm data and subtracting the kurucz model from this fit .",
    "the derived values for the optical and infrared luminosity of bd+404124 are @xmath22 and @xmath23  l@xmath6 , respectively .",
    "these luminosities place the star close to the zero - age main sequence position of a 10  m@xmath6 star in the hertzsprung - russell diagram ( hrd ) .",
    "we followed the same procedure to construct a sed for lkh@xmath0 224 , combining optical , infrared and submm photometry from literature ( strom et al .",
    "1972a ; shevchenko , personal communication ; hillenbrand et al . 1995 ; cohen 1972 ; di francesco et al .",
    "1997 ) with our new iso spectra .",
    "it is shown in fig .",
    "6b . since lkh@xmath0 224 is strongly variable in the optical , the data used in the sed were selected to be obtained near maximum system brightness , when available .",
    "the optical to infrared photometry of lkh@xmath0 224 forms a smooth curve in the sed , which we interpret as due to continuum emission from the star in the optical , and thermal emission from dust heated by the central star in the infrared .",
    "there is no agreement in the literature on the spectral type of lkh@xmath0 224 .",
    "wenzel ( 1980 ) classified the star spectroscopically as b8e , whereas hillenbrand et al .",
    "( 1995 ) obtained a spectral type of b5 ve .",
    "corcoran & ray ( 1997 ) derived a spectral type of a0 for lkh@xmath0 224 , based upon the relative strength of the hei @xmath244471 and mgii @xmath244481 lines .",
    "in the optical , lkh@xmath0 224 shows large - amplitude photometric variations ( @xmath14 3 ) due to variable amounts of circumstellar extinction ( wenzel 1980 ; shevchenko et al .",
    "1991 , 1993 ) . in the group of herbig ae",
    "/ be stars , these large - amplitude variations are only observed when the spectral type is a0 or later ( van den ancker et al .",
    "therefore we favour a later spectral type than b for lkh@xmath0 224 .",
    "the detection of the caii h and k lines in absorption ( magakyan & movseyan 1997 ) also seems to favour a later spectral type than mid - b .",
    "recent optical spectroscopy of lkh@xmath0 224 by de winter ( personal communication ) shows strong , variable , p - cygni type emission in h@xmath0 .",
    "the higher members of the balmer series ( up to h15 ) are present and in absorption , together with the caii h and k lines .",
    "numerous shell lines are present in the spectrum as well , which could hinder spectral classification solely based upon red spectra . from the available optical spectroscopy",
    ", we classify lkh@xmath0 224 as a7e+sh , corresponding to @xmath15 = 7850  k. we estimate the uncertainty in this classification to be around 2 subclasses , or 400  k.    with the new spectral type of a7e+sh and the optical photometry by strom et al .",
    "( 1972a ) , we derive an @xmath18 at maximum system brightness for lkh@xmath0 224 of 096 . again fitting a kurucz model to the extinction - corrected photometry , we derive values for the optical and infrared luminosity of lkh@xmath0 224 of @xmath25 and @xmath26  l@xmath6 , respectively .",
    "the good fit of the sed to the kurucz model with @xmath15 = 7850  k shows that the photometry is consistent with our adopted spectral type of a7e for lkh@xmath0 224 .",
    "comparing the derived parameters of lkh@xmath0 224 with the pre - main sequence evolutionary tracks by palla & stahler ( 1993 ) , we see that it is located in the hrd at the location of a @xmath27  yr old 3.5  m@xmath6 star .",
    "this brings the age of the star in good agreement with those of the low - mass members of the bd+404124 group ( hillenbrand et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "again the same procedure as above was followed to construct a sed for lkh@xmath0 225 ( fig .",
    "6c ) , combining optical to radio measurements from literature ( shevchenko , personal communication ; hillenbrand et al . 1995 ; cohen 1972 ; weaver & jones 1992 ; di francesco et al .",
    "1998 ; henning et al . 1998 ; cohen et al . 1982 ) with our iso data .",
    "these data refer to the sum of all components in this object .",
    "since lkh@xmath0 225 shows strong variability in the optical and infrared , only data obtained near maximum brightness was used in the sed . like in bd+404124 ,",
    "the sed of lkh@xmath0 225 consists of a smooth continuum ranging from the optical to the submm . in view of the knowledge of the nature of lkh@xmath0 225 from literature ,",
    "this sed must be interpreted as the sum of the three components of lkh@xmath0 225 in the optical to submm , each consisting of a hot component with circumstellar dust emission .",
    "the plotted iras fluxes of iras 20187 + 4111 ( weaver & jones 1992 ) are smaller than those in the lkh@xmath0 225 lws spectrum .",
    "most likely , this is due to the background subtraction applied on the iras data .",
    "this means that a cool component is present as well throughout the region , covering an area that is larger than the size of the iras detectors . in view of submm maps of the region ( aspin et al .",
    "1994 ; henning et al .",
    "1998 ) , this seems plausible .    as can be seen in fig .",
    "6c , below 8  @xmath8 m the flux levels in the sws spectrum are considerably smaller than those from ground - based photometry at maximum brightness . at longer wavelengths they agree . by extrapolating our iso sws spectrum",
    ", we deduce that the total @xmath28 band magnitude of lkh@xmath0 225 was about 83 at the time of our observation .",
    "this is within the range of values present in the literature . above 10  @xmath8 m",
    ", the sws flux levels are in agreement with ground - based measurements , suggesting that the large - amplitude variability of lkh@xmath0 225 is limited to the optical to near - infrared spectral range .",
    "the spectral type of lkh@xmath0 225 is very uncertain .",
    "hillenbrand et al . (",
    "1995 ) give a spectroscopic classification of mid a ",
    "fe for both lkh@xmath0 225-north and lkh@xmath0 225-south , whereas wenzel ( 1980 ) derives a spectral type of g ",
    "ke for the sum of both components .",
    "aspin et al . (",
    "1994 ) suggested the southern component to be of intermediate - mass , based on its high bolometric luminosity . unlike for bd+404124 and",
    "lkh@xmath0 224 , this makes the direct derivation of @xmath18 very uncertain . adopting @xmath18 = 497 , corresponding to @xmath29 derived from the silicate feature in the next section , results in an optical slope in the energy distribution that is steeper than the rayleigh - jeans tail of a black body",
    "this could be because the extinction at the time of the optical observations was smaller than during the iso observations .",
    "therefore we used a rather uncertain value of @xmath18 = 236 , based on the observed @xmath30 colour of lkh@xmath0 225 and the intrinsic colours of a f0 star , to correct the photometry of lkh@xmath0 225 for extinction .    to obtain a rough measure for the total luminosity of lkh@xmath0 225",
    ", we fitted a kurucz model with @xmath15 = 7200  k , corresponding to a spectral type of f0 , to the extinction - corrected optical photometry .",
    "this results in values of @xmath31 and @xmath32  l@xmath6 for the total optical and infrared luminosities of lkh@xmath0 225 .",
    "we conclude that at least one of the stars in the lkh@xmath0 225 system must be a massive ( 57  m@xmath6 ) pre - main sequence object in order to explain these luminosities .",
    "the iso full grating scans of bd+404124 consist of a relatively smooth continuum , with a number of strong emission lines superimposed .",
    "the familiar unidentified infrared ( uir ) emission features at 3.3 , 6.2 , 7.6 , 7.8 , 8.6 and 11.3  @xmath8 m , often attributed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) , are prominently present .",
    "possibly the 12.7  @xmath8 m feature also observed in other sources showing strong pah emission ( beintema et al .",
    "1996 ) is present as well .",
    "no 9.7  @xmath8 m amorphous silicate feature , either in emission or in absorption , is visible in the bd+404124 sws spectrum .",
    "the slight curvature in the ground - based 813",
    "@xmath8 m bd+404124 spectrum obtained by rodgers & wooden ( 1997 ) , which they interpreted as a silicate feature in emission , is absent in our sws data .",
    "the continuum in bd+404124 seems to consist of two distinct components , one from 2.413  @xmath8 m and the other from 13200  @xmath8 m . in the sws range",
    ", it is well fit by the superposition of two blackbodies of 320 and 100  k. for the lws spectrum a significant excess at the long - wavelength part remains after the black - body fit .",
    "probably a range in temperatures is present starting from 100  k down to much lower temperatures .",
    "the jumps in the spectrum at the positions corresponding to a change in aperture suggest that this component is caused by diffuse emission in the star forming region .",
    "remarkably , the line flux measured in the 3.3  @xmath8 m pah feature of bd+404124 ( @xmath33  w  m@xmath34 ) is much larger than the @xmath35  w  m@xmath34 upper limit obtained by brooke et al .",
    "pah features also appear absent in the 813  @xmath8 m hifogs spectrum shown by rodgers & wooden ( 1997 ) .",
    "this could either be an effect of the different aperture size used ( @xmath36  for sws versus a 14 circular aperture by brooke et al . ) in case the pah emission is spatially extended , or be due to time - variability of the pah emission .",
    "if the first explanation is correct , the pah emission should come from a region with a diameter larger than 32 and hence be easily resolvable with ground - based imaging .",
    "the iso spectrum of lkh@xmath0 224 consists of one single smooth continuum , with a few emission lines superimposed .",
    "no solid - state emission or absorption is apparent in the sws spectrum . again",
    "the slight curvature seen in the hifogs 813  @xmath8 m spectrum of lkh@xmath0 224 ( rodgers & wooden 1997 ) is absent in our sws data . in view of the fact that most herbig ae stars show strong silicate emission in the 10  @xmath8 m range ( e.g. van den ancker 1999 ) ,",
    "the absence of the silicate feature is quite remarkable .",
    "it means that the dust emission must come from a region which is completely optically thick up to infrared wavelengths and yet only produce 3 magnitudes of extinction towards the central star in the optical .",
    "it is obvious that such a region can not be spherically symmetric , but must be highly flattened or have a hole through which we can seen the central star relatively unobscured",
    ". a dusty circumstellar disk might be the prime candidate for such a region .",
    "the absence of silicate emission in lkh@xmath0 224 might then be explained by either an intrinsically higher optical depth in its circumstellar disk than those surrounding other herbig ae stars , a view supported by its relative youth , or be caused by a nearly edge - on orientation of the circumstellar disk .",
    "the infrared continuum of lkh@xmath0 224 can not be fit by a single blackbody .",
    "rather a sum of blackbodies with a range of temperatures starting at several hundreds kelvins and continuing to temperatures of a few tens of k are required to fit the spectrum adequately .",
    "again the jumps in the spectrum at the positions corresponding to a change in aperture are present , suggesting that at the longer wavelengths we are looking at diffuse emission in the star forming region . however , the slope of the continuum in lkh@xmath0 224 is significantly different from that of the cool component in bd+404124 .",
    "this could either be due to a difference in the maximum temperature or to a difference in temperature gradient of the diffuse component between the two positions .",
    "the sws spectrum of lkh@xmath0 225 looks very different .",

    "ro - vibrational as well as pure rotational emission from h@xmath1 was detected ( fig .",
    "both the higher pure rotational lines and the ro - vibrational lines significantly deviate from the straight line defined by the lower pure rotational lines in the excitation diagram and do not form a smooth line by themselves , as expected in the case of multiple thermal components .",
    "such a situation can either occur because of fluorescence of h@xmath1 in a strong uv field ( black & van dishoeck 1987 ; draine & bertoldi 1996 ) , be due to x - ray or euv heating ( wolfire & knigl 1991 ; tin et al .",
    "1997 ) , or be due to the formation energy of re - formed h@xmath1 in post - shock gas ( shull & hollenbach 1978 ) . although the h@xmath1 spectra resulting from the possible formation mechanisms do differ in the relative prominence of transitions with @xmath99 ( black & van dishoeck 1987 ) , the distinction between these situations is rather difficult to make with the detected lines in lkh@xmath0 225 .    by summing all the apparent column densities for the ro - vibrational and higher pure rotational lines we obtain an estimate for the observed total column of non - thermal h@xmath1 in lkh@xmath0 225 of @xmath100  cm@xmath34 , corresponding to @xmath101  m@xmath6 or 0.3 earth masses within the sws beam .",
    "this value of @xmath102(h@xmath103 ) is within the range predicted by uv fluorescence models .",
    "however , the absence of pah emission in lkh@xmath0 225 at the time of the iso observations suggests that there was no strong uv radiation field at that time .",
    "therefore we consider the possibility that the ro - vibrational h@xmath1 emission originates in a shock more likely .",
    "interestingly , in lkh@xmath0 225 we have detected two pairs of lines arising from the same energy level : the 10 q(1 ) & 10 o(3 ) and the 10 q(3 ) & 10 o(5 ) lines .",
    "for these pairs of lines @xmath84 must be identical .",
    "therefore they can be used to derive a differential extinction between the two wavelengths of the lines using @xmath104 . using the interstellar extinction curve by fluks et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , we can then convert the differential extinction to a value of @xmath45 .",
    "the results of this procedure are values for @xmath45 of @xmath105 and @xmath106 for the 10 q(1 ) & 10 o(3 ) and 10 q(3 ) & 10 o(5 ) line pairs , respectively .",
    "these extinction values are somewhat larger than the @xmath107 derived from the silicate feature in section 4 .",
    "but they agree well with @xmath44 obtained from the c@xmath7o column density towards lkh@xmath0 225 ( palla et al .",
    "if the slope of the infrared extinction law is approximately interstellar , the extinction towards the region producing the low - lying pure rotational h@xmath1 lines in lkh@xmath0 225 must be smaller than this value though ; such a large extinction would cause the extinction - corrected 00 s(3 ) line to deviate significantly from the thermal distribution line in the excitation diagram , since it is located within the 9.7  @xmath8 m silicate feature in the extinction curve .",
    "we conclude that in lkh@xmath0 225 either there must be two distinct sources of h@xmath1 emission , a 710  k thermal component suffering little extinction  presumably a c - shock  and a heavily extincted , deeply embedded component  possibly a j - shock , or the slope of the infrared extinction law towards this region must be much steeper than interstellar .",
    "at both the positions of bd+404124 and lkh@xmath0 225 , several emission lines due to the @xmath108 = 00 transitions of gas - phase co were detected in the long - wavelength part of the lws spectra ( table  2 ) .",

    "we estimate the errors in these fit parameters to be around 50  k in temperature and 50% in co column .",
    "the observed co lines have critical densities of around 10@xmath111  @xmath4 .",
    "therefore the observation of these lines also implies densities of at least this order of magnitude in the originating region .",
    "the co excitation temperature of 500  k found at the position of bd+404124 is comparable to that found from the h@xmath1 lines .",
    "the co / h@xmath1 mass fraction of 0.01 is compatible for what one would expect for the warm gas in a pdr .",
    "however , assuming that densities of around 10@xmath111  @xmath4 would exist in the entire bd+404124 pdr would be implausible .",
    "we therefore conclude that if these co lines and the h@xmath1 both originate in the large - scale environment of bd+404124 , the pdr must have a clumpy structure ( e.g. burton et al .",
    "1990 ) .",
    "the co emission arising from the neighbourhood of lkh@xmath0 225 is remarkably different from that seen in h@xmath1 : here the excitation temperature of the co is much lower than that found in h@xmath1 .",
    "the co / h@xmath1 mass fraction of 0.03 is also much higher than that found at the position of bd+404124 .",
    "it seems likely that another component than the c - shock responsible for the h@xmath1 emission needs to be invoked to explain the low co excitation temperature . again",

    "we conclude that the [ oiii ] lines observed by lws are formed in a hii region with @xmath119 = 0.62.2 @xmath120 @xmath121  @xmath4 . in view of the 22,000  k effective temperature of bd+404124 , it is surprising that [ oiii ] emission is detected , since simple photo - ionization models predict that for stars with @xmath15 @xmath13 32,000  k most oxygen should remain neutral .",
    "clearly another ionization model must be present here .",
    "possibly the region also responsible for the hi lines could collisionally ionize the oxygen and we are observing the outer , low - density part of an ionized wind .",
    "apart from the pdr , a hii region surrounding bd+404124 may also contribute significantly to the observed [ feii ] and [ siii ] emission .",
    "therefore we have used the photo - ionization code cloudy ( version 90.04 ; ferland 1996 ) to generate model predictions for line strengths for an hii region surrounding bd+404124 .",
    "a kurucz ( 1991 ) model with parameters appropriate for bd+404124 was taken as the input spectrum , and a spherical geometry and a constant electron density of 2 @xmath120 @xmath121  @xmath4 throughout the hii region were assumed . according to this model , 30% of the observed [ siii ] 34.82  @xmath8 m flux and 40% of the 25.99  @xmath8 m [ feii ] flux will originate in the hii region . from comparing the remainder of the fluxes of the atomic fine structure lines to the pdr models of tielens & hollenbach ( 1985 ) , we derive that the pdr should be fairly dense ( @xmath2 10@xmath117  @xmath4 ) and have an incident far - uv field of about 10@xmath117  g@xmath94 .",
    "the extent of this pdr should be around 180 square arcseconds , or about half of the sws beam .    in view of the observed h@xmath1 spectrum ( section 7 ) , a c - shock appears the most likely candidate for explaining the observed [ si ] emission in lkh@xmath0 224 .",
    "a c - shock with a shock velocity of around 20  km  s@xmath5 can explain both the h@xmath1 and [ si ] emission .",
    "however , the density and extent of the region are poorly constrained : the emission may either arise in a dense ( @xmath2 10@xmath111  @xmath4 ) region of only a few square arcseconds , or arise in a region of about 10@xmath6110@xmath117  @xmath4 with a high beam filling factor .",
    "since it is observed in the largest sws aperture , the observed [ siii ] emission could be due to contamination from lkh@xmath0 225 ( see fig .",
    "5 ) .    for lkh@xmath0 225",
    "the situation appears more complicated .",
    "the detection of [ si ] clearly shows that a shock must be present in the region .",
    "a c - shock can explain the observed thermal h@xmath1 component , with similar parameters as for lkh@xmath0 224 , but can only explain part of the [ si ] emission .",
    "the [ feii ] and [ siii ] emission could either come from a deeply embedded hii region , a deeply embedded pdr , or a j - shock . in view of the necessity to have an additional source of [ si ] emission ,",
    "the most likely candidate might be a j - shock . a j - shock model with @xmath96 @xmath2 60  km  s@xmath5 and @xmath60 @xmath2 10@xmath11710@xmath118  @xmath4",
    "can indeed reproduce the observed [ si ] and [ siii ] intensities .",
    "however , to reproduce the observed [ feii ] 26.0  @xmath8 m strength , iron would have to be about eight times more depleted than assumed in the tielens & hollenbach pdr models .",
    "the observed [ cii ] 157.7  @xmath8 m emission at the position of lkh@xmath0 225 can not be explained by shocks .",
    "this could very well be due to contamination by the bd+404124 pdr or the galactic [ cii ] background , however .",
    "fit parameters for the pdr , j - shock and c - shock models used to explain the h@xmath1 , co and fine structure emission lines are listed in table  3 . the summed model predictions for the line fluxes are listed in table  2 .",
    "in the previous sections we have seen that in a small ob association like the bd+404124 group , different phenomena contribute to at first glance similar line spectra .",
    "the emission at the position of bd+404124 is well reproduced by the combination of a hii region around bd+404124 with a pdr . in section 7",
    "we derived values of the far - uv radiation field for its pdr from the observed emission lines .",
    "it is useful to compare those values to those expected from the central star to see whether that is a sufficient source of radiation , or another exciting source needs to be invoked . from the kurucz ( 1991 )",
    "model with @xmath15 = 22,000  k and @xmath122 , fitted to the extinction - corrected uv to optical sed of bd+404124 ( section 3 ) , we compute that bd+404124 has a total far - uv ( 613.6 ev ) luminosity of @xmath123  l@xmath6 . at a location",
    "@xmath124  au from the central star , this field will have diluted to the value of @xmath125  g@xmath94 obtained from the infrared lines . at the bd+404124 distance of 1  kpc , this corresponds to an angular separation of 5 , consistent with the constraints imposed by the sws aperture .",
    "we conclude that bd+404124 can indeed be responsible for the incident uv flux upon the pdr observed in that vicinity .",
    "compared to the far - uv luminosity of bd+404124 , the other two sources only show little uv emission ( 3 and 6  l@xmath6 for lkh@xmath0 224 and 225 , respectively ) , explaining why we do nt observe a pdr at those positions .",

    "for lkh@xmath0 224 we showed that the infrared emission - line spectrum could be explained by a single non - dissociative shock .",
    "a c - shock with very similar parameters may also be present at the position of lkh@xmath0 225 .",
    "comparing our iso sws aperture positions ( fig .",
    "5 ) with the image of the bipolar outflow centered on lkh@xmath0 225 ( palla et al .",
    "1995 ) , we note that this outflow covers both lkh@xmath0 224 and lkh@xmath0 225 .",
    "one possible identification for the c - shock in both lkh@xmath0 224 and lkh@xmath0 225 might therefore be the shock created as the outflow originating from lkh@xmath0 225 drives into the surrounding molecular cloud .",
    "apart from the large - scale c - shock , we have seen that probably a j - shock is present in lkh@xmath0 225 as well .",
    "this can be naturally identified with the herbig - haro knot lkh@xmath0 225-m observed in [ sii ] in the optical ( magakyan & movseyan 1997 ) .",
    "it remains unclear whether the ro - vibrational h@xmath1 lines observed in this object are due to h@xmath1 fluorescence by ly@xmath0 photons or to h@xmath1 re - formation in the post - shock gas .",
    "spectroscopy of lines with higher @xmath108 is required to clarify this .    in the line of sight toward lkh@xmath0 225 ,",
    "a large column consisting of warm gas - phase co , co@xmath1 and h@xmath1o and solid water ice and silicates was detected .",
    "the column of gas - phase water was found to be about 10 times higher that that of water ice .",
    "no co@xmath1 ice was detected toward lkh@xmath0 225 , demonstrating that the bulk of the co@xmath1 is in the gas - phase . in table  4",
    "we compare the derived gas / solid ratio for lkh@xmath0 225 with those found in the lines of sight towards other young stellar objects .",
    "both the h@xmath1o and co@xmath1 gas / solid ratios are much higher than those found in other ysos . for co@xmath1 , the lower limit to the gas /",
    "solid is even a factor 100 higher than that found in the source with the previously reported highest ratio ! at this point we can only speculate as to why this is the case .",
    "one possible explanation could be that the radiation field of bd+404124 is heating the outer layers of the lkh@xmath0 225 envelope , evaporating the co@xmath1 ice .",
    "if this is the case , bd+404124 should be located closer to the observer than lkh@xmath0 225 , suggesting that lkh@xmath0 225 is located at the far side of the `` blister '' in which the bd+404124 group is located .",
    "another explanation could be that the lkh@xmath0 225 core itself is unusually warm .",
    "since the abundance of gas - phase water is sensitive to the temperature ( charnley 1997 ) , this would also explain the high abundance of water vapour in the line of sight toward lkh@xmath0 225 .",
    "because lkh@xmath0 225 is less massive than the luminous objects in which the previous gas / solid ratios have been determined , this high temperature might reflect a more evolved nature of the lkh@xmath0 225 core .",
    "future research , such as a temperature determination from gas - phase co measurements , should be able to distinguish between these possibilities and show whether we have discovered the chemically most evolved hot core known to date , or are looking through a line of sight particularly contaminated by a nearby ob star .",

    "<S> we present the results of iso sws and lws grating scans towards the three brightest members of the bd+404124 group in the infrared : bd+404124 ( b2ve ) , lkh@xmath0 224 ( a7e ) and the embedded source lkh@xmath0 225 . </S>",
    "<S> emission from the pure rotational lines of h@xmath1 , from ro - vibrational transitions of co , from pahs , from hi recombination lines and from the infrared fine structure lines of [ feii ] , [ siii ] , [ si ] , [ oi ] , [ oiii ] and [ cii ] was detected . </S>",
    "<S> these emission lines arise in the combination of a low - density ( @xmath2 10@xmath3  @xmath4 ) hii region with a clumpy pdr in the case of bd+404124 </S>",
    "<S> . the lower transitions of the infrared hi lines observed in bd+404124 are optically thick ; most likely they arise in either a dense wind or a circumstellar disk . </S>",
    "<S> this same region is also responsible for the optical hi lines and the radio continuum emission . in the lines of sight towards lkh@xmath0 224 and lkh@xmath0 225 , </S>",
    "<S> the observed emission lines arise in a non - dissociative shock produced by a slow ( @xmath2 20  km  s@xmath5 ) outflow arising from lkh@xmath0 225 . toward lkh@xmath0 225 </S>",
    "<S> we also observe a dissociative shock , presumably located closer to the outflow source than the non - dissociative shock . in the line of sight towards lkh@xmath0 225 we observed absorption features due to solid water ice and amorphous silicates , and due to gas - phase h@xmath1o , co and co@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> no solid co@xmath1 was detected towards lkh@xmath0 225 , making this the first line of sight where the bulk of the co@xmath1 is in the gas - phase . </S>"
