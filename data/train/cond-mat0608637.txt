    "recently , heavy quasiparticles or heavy fermions normally appearing in ce- and yb - based compounds have been observed in transition - metal compounds  @xcite , for example liv@xmath5o@xmath0  @xcite , mnsi  @xcite and zrzn@xmath5  @xcite to name a few .",
    "these materials have attracted attention because of their various physical properties , including those related to their performance as unconventional superconductors  @xcite .",
    "the origin of the various physical properties is believed to be related to the hybridization of charge carriers to localized spins .",

    "both systems can be fundamentally explained by the self - consistent renormalization ( scr ) theory  @xcite .",
    "however , the sommerfeld coefficient , @xmath9 , is enhanced by about 100 mj / mol k@xmath10 in @xmath6fe@xmath0sb@xmath1  @xcite compared to 53.2 mj / mol k@xmath10 predicted by a band structure calculation  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the ratio between the enhanced coefficient @xmath11 of the quadratic electrical resistivity ( @xmath12 = @xmath13 ) and @xmath9 is close to the kadowaki - woods value [ 1.0 @xmath14 10@xmath15 cm k@xmath16/(mj / mol k@xmath10)@xmath10 ]  @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the hybridization between the charge carriers and the localized spins in @xmath6fe@xmath0sb@xmath1 plays an important role at low temperatures .",
    "the physical properties of srfe@xmath0sb@xmath1 are similar to those of the transition - metal compounds mentioned above .",
    "therefore , srfe@xmath0sb@xmath1 should exhibit similar physical properties to those of other transition - metal compounds as well as heavy fermion compounds .",
    "the hybridization of the charge carriers to the localized magnetic moments forms heavy quasiparticles , which is called `` kondo effect '' . in optical spectra ,",
    "a renormalized drude absorption due to these heavy quasiparticles is observed . in heavy fermions and other transition - metal compounds mentioned above , the enhancement in the optical conductivity [ @xmath18 at @xmath19  =  0  ev ( coherent peak ) and a peak at higher energy ( incoherent peak ) increase at low temperatures despite the fact that drude curves for novel metals usually appear at high temperatures .",
    "such a change in @xmath20 has been observed in mnsi  @xcite and sr@xmath5ruo@xmath0  @xcite and in high-@xmath7 cuprates  @xcite . to clarify the appearance of the coherent and incoherent peaks in srfe@xmath0sb@xmath1 as well as the origin of the large @xmath9 ,",

    "@xmath30 also decreases with increasing magnetic field strength  @xcite .",
    "the combination of the decreasing @xmath30 and the change in @xmath20 implies that the coherent and incoherent peaks collapse in the presence of a magnetic field .",

    "<S> temperature - dependent infrared reflectivity spectra of srfe@xmath0sb@xmath1 has been measured . a renormalized drude peak with a heavy effective mass and a pronounced pseudogap of 10  mev develops in the optical conductivity spectra at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> as the temperature decreases below 100  k , the effective mass ( @xmath2 ) rapidly increases , and the scattering rate ( @xmath3 ) is quenched . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature dependence of @xmath2 and @xmath3 indicates that the hybridization between the fe @xmath4 spins and the charge carriers plays an important role in determining the physical properties of srfe@xmath0sb@xmath1 at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> this result is the clear evidence of the iron - based heavy quasiparticles . </S>"
