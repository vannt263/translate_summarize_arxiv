    "the conversion efficiency is maximum for incidence in the plane spanned by the density gradient ( assumed in the @xmath11 direction ) and magnetic field ( pointing in the @xmath12 direction ) with an optimal @xmath12 component of the refractive index , @xmath13 , with @xmath14 evaluated at the @xmath6 location .",
    "the rest of the wave keeps the original o - mode polarization and is reflected by the o - mode cutoff with angle - dependent reflectivity @xmath15 . from eq.[eq : refl ] it follows that @xmath15 contains information on the magnetic field strength ( through @xmath14 ) .",
    "it also contains information on the field orientation , because the plane @xmath16 is spanned by the density gradient ( basically , the minor radius direction ) and the magnetic field , therefore its inclination in the laboratory frame is the same as the magnetic pitch angle .",
    "both pieces of information are evaluated at the cutoff layer for the frequency considered .",
    "that is , the diagnostic is internal and local .",

    "the new technique proposed here overcomes this limitation and is applicable whenever reflectometry is applicable .",
    "furthermore , the signal to noise ratio is higher , by simply adopting a sufficiently intense reflectometric source .",
    "the spatial and temporal resolution are comparable with other reflectometric imaging systems @xcite .",

    "the rf module enables solution of maxwell s equations in media characterized by anisotropic complex dielectric tensors with spatial variations in 1d , 2d and 3d .",

    "this study offers a preliminary outlook towards the possibility of reflectometrically measuring the magnetic field @xmath0 at the o - mode cutoff layer . as discussed in connection with eq.[eq : refl ] and fig.[fig : cont ] , the information on the magnetic pitch angle is contained in the inclination of the angular contours of reflectivity , and the information on @xmath80 is contained in the special direction yielding maximum ox conversion efficiency , hence minimum reflectivity of the o - mode .",

    ". the cutoff will reflect power accidentally injected in the x - mode .",
    "furthermore , the uh resonance and the evanescent layer lying between it and the r cutoff will nearly entirely prevent the x - mode generated by the ox conversion from reaching the receivers outside the plasma .",
    "in other words , the r cutoff and uh resonance would `` sanitize '' the diagnostic scheme from fast x and slow x - mode waves , respectively , and the receivers would only ( or mostly ) detect the reflected o - mode of interest .    in that case , wave propagation shares similarities with ebw emission diagnostics based on the bxo mode conversion . yet",
    ", the anti - radar diagnostic will offer the advantages of being an active diagnostic and not relying on the plasma to be over - dense and to be an intense ebw emitter with good b - x conversion efficiency .",
    "future simulations at high frequency will be necessary to confirm that the x - mode wave does not affect the signal at the receivers and will further strengthen confidence in the feasibility of the diagnostic .",
    "further improvements could include extension to 3d , inclusion of the full details of the tokamak magnetic field topology and a more realistic antenna geometry .",
    "it is also planned to investigate the effects of toroidal ripples , density and magnetic fluctuations on reflectivity .",
    "such realistic models will provide a basis for the interpretation of the experimental measurements .",
