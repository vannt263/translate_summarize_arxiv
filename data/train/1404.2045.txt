    "in recent years , the formation and propagation of a new type of optical solitons , i.e. ultraslow optical solitons , created in resonant multi - level media via electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite , has attracted much attention @xcite . by the quantum interference effect induced by a control field , the absorption of a probe field can be largely suppressed .",
    "simultaneously , a drastic change of dispersion and a giant enhancement of kerr nonlinearity can be achieved via eit .",
    "it has been shown that , by the balance of the dispersion and the kerr nonlinearity , temporal optical solitons with very small propagating velocity and very low generation power can form and propagate stably for a long distance .",
    "the possibility of producing weak - light spatial and spatia - temporal optical solitons in eit - based media has also been suggested  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the optical beam deflection in an atomic system with inhomogeneous external magnetic fields has been the subject of many previous works  @xcite .",
    "physically , atomic energy levels are space - dependent if an inhomogeneous magnetic field is applied , which results in a spatial dependence of optical refraction index of the atomic medium and hence a deflection of optical beam when passing through the medium . in a remarkable experiment",
    "@xcite , karpa and weitz demonstrated that photons can acquire effective magnetic moments when propagating in eit media , and hence can deflect significantly in a transverse gradient magnetic field , which is regarded as an optical analog of stern - gerlach ( sg ) effect of atoms .",
    "the work by karpa and weitz  @xcite has stimulated a flourished theoretical and experimental studies on the sg effect of slow light via eit  @xcite .",
    "recently , a scheme to exhibit eit - enhanced sg deflection of weak - light vector optical solitons in an eit medium has been suggested  @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we propose a scheme to produce ultraslow ( 3 + 1)-dimensional helical optical solitons , alias helical optical bullets , in a resonant three - level @xmath0-type atomic system via quantum coherence .",
    "we show that due to the eit effect the helical optical bullets found can propagate with ultraslow velocity up to @xmath1 @xmath2 ( @xmath2 is the light speed in vacuum ) in longitudinal direction and a slow rotational motion ( with velocity @xmath3 @xmath2 ) in transverse directions .",
    "the generation power of such optical bullets can be lowered to the magnitude of microwatt , and their stability can be achieved by using a bessel optical lattice potential formed by a far - detuned laser field .",
    "we also show that the transverse rotational motion of the optical bullets can be accelerated by the use of a time - dependent sg magnetic field . because of",
    "the ultraslow velocity in the longitudinal direction , a significant acceleration of the rotational motion of the optical bullets may be observed for a very short medium length .",
    "we stress that the ultraslow helical optical bullets found here have many attractive features .",
    "first , because of the giant kerr nonlinearity induced by the eit effect the optical bullets can form in a very short distance ( at the order of centimeter ) with extremely low generation power ( at the order of microwatt ) .",
    "second , they have ultraslow propagating velocity which prolongs the interaction time between light and atoms .",
    "third , their motional trajectories are helical curves ( see fig .",
    "[ fig4](c ) below ) .",
    "fourth , because of the active character of our system it is very easy to realize an efficient magneto - optical manipulation of the helical optical bullets by using the energy - level structure of atoms and selection rules of optical transitions . due to these features",
    ", the ultraslow helical optical bullets obtained here may become candidates for light information processing and transmission at a very weak light level .",
    "note that in recent years several authors have done interesting works on linear and nonlinear matter waves in bose - einstein condensates with toroidal traps and realized their acceleration  @xcite .",
    "however , in those works no ultraslow bullets and their helical motion have been obtained .",
