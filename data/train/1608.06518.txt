    ", the two advanced ligo detectors recorded their first significant event , gw150914 , produced by the merger of two black holes ( bhs ) with masses of @xmath1m@xmath2 and @xmath3m@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "a panchromatic ( radio to @xmath4-rays ) follow - up campaign of gw150914 was carried out by partner electromagnetic ( em ) facilities , marking the start of gw astronomy ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "no high - significance em counterpart to gw150914 was found , although a @xmath4-ray event ( compatible with the large gw localization area ) occurring @xmath5s after gw150914 was reported by the _ fermi_/gbm team @xcite .",
    "a second gw alert was sent out to em partners in october 2015 , but the event that triggered this alert ( g194575 ) was subsequently retracted as a false alarm @xcite .",
    "finally , in december 2015 , advanced ligo recorded a second significant binary bh event , gw151226 @xcite .",
    "this detection was also accompanied by a vast em follow - up effort @xcite .",
    "stellar mass bh binaries such as the ones that produced gw150914 and gw151226 are generally not expected to be associated with detectable em signatures ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , after the first ligo detection was announced , and following the _ _ fermi/__gbm claim , several ideas have emerged about the possibility of producing em counterparts to events like gw150914 .",
    "proposed models range from em signals emitted from in - falling matter from a circum - binary disk , to dissipation of magnetic energy and extraction of rotational energy from a bh via the blandford - znajek process @xcite .",
    "fallback material from a supernova ( sn ) explosion may remain bound around a bh for long periods and re - ignite accretion as the binary tightens @xcite . the core - collapse of a massive star may lead to the formation of `` blobs '' that evolve separately and merge , with some remaining core material falling into the merger remnant to produce a @xmath4-ray burst ( grb ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although this scenario is controversial @xcite .",
    "it has also been suggested that bh merger events of sufficient energy ( @xmath6erg in collimation  corrected kinetic energy ) occurring in dense enough circum - stellar material ( csm ) , and/or powering fast outflows that shock the ism , may produce radio signatures of a few to a few tens of @xmath7jy at 1.4 ghz @xcite .",
    "the existence of detectable em emission from binary bh mergers remains speculative .",
    "however , advanced ligo should detect 0.4400 neutron star ( ns)-ns and 0.2300 ns - bh binaries per year when reaching nominal sensitivity @xcite .",
    "compact binary mergers involving at least one ns are expected to produce em emission .",
    "indeed , these events could power short grbs ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) ,",

    "optical kilonova and radio emissions , unlike the @xmath8rays , are less affected by collimation , relativistic beaming , and viewing angle effects , thus offering a better chance of detection for binary ns ( or bh - ns ) mergers launching relativistic jets not aligned with our line of sight ( which are expected to constitute the majority of advanced ligo detections ) .",
    "given the large error areas associated with advanced ligo localizations @xcite , the detection of an em counterpart via large field - of - view ( fov ) facilities such as the intermediate palomar transient factory ( iptf ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can provide orders of magnitude better localizations , and enable panchromatic follow - up observations with smaller fov instruments like the karl g. jansky very large array ( vla ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in turn",
    ", a radio detection in coincidence with one of the many optical candidates expected to be found in the error - area of a gw event can help enhance the confidence in the em counterpart association , rule out false associations , and constrain source and environment properties . while gws from a tidally disrupted ns in a ns ",

    "the presence of an agn in iptf15dmn is suggested by the optical variability and nuclear origin observed during our iptf follow  up . a pre - outburst optical spectrum of iptf15dmn host by the 6df galaxy redshift survey @xcite reveals broad h@xmath9 emission , and a large [ ] to h@xmath9 emission line ratio in the narrow lines galaxy emission component , that also point toward the presence of an agn in this galaxy @xcite .",
    "optical spectroscopy of iptf15dni obtained _ after _ the gw trigger reveals a similar pattern of broad h@xmath9 emission and strong narrow emission lines of [ ] and @xcite .",
    "the spectrum is contaminated by significantly stronger stellar continuum ; however , we consider it quite likely that an agn is present in this case as well .",
    "it is interesting to note that neither iptf15dni nor iptf15dmn appear in the locus of agn based on their radio emission or _ wise _ colors ( figs .",
    "[ power_vs_z ] and [ wise_col_col ] ) .",
    "the fact that iptf15dni and iptf15dmu are not classified as agn for their radio emission is not surprising .",
    "indeed , @xcite have shown that because deep radio data detect emission related to stellar processes ( e.g. , supernova remnants ) as well as agn activity , @xmath10 of _ wise_-selected agn candidates are expected to have radio matches .",
    "however , only @xmath11 of _ wise_-selected agn with spectroscopic redshifts are radio loud according to the criteria shown in figure [ power_vs_z ] . on the other hand , one possibility ( suggested by our spectra of iptf15dni ) for the lack on _",
    "wise _ color indication of agn activity in iptf15dni and iptf15dmn is that the agn emission is relatively weak ( compared to the stellar continuum ) , and so accretion onto the central super - massive bh may not significantly impact the infrared colors of such galaxies .",
    "regardless of the actual reason for this observed phenomenon , it is clear that _ wise _ color or radio brightness cuts can not be used exclusively to _ rule out _ an agn origin for future radio transient follow - up .",
    "our rms sensitivity in the vla follow - up observations of the _ fermi_/lat transient identified in the error region of g194575 ( see sections [ vla_program]-[da ] ) was @xmath12mjy at @xmath13ghz during the first epoch ( which was used to extract sources ; fig .",
    "[ fig : rms_vs_radius ] ) .",
    "close proximity to the sun , rfi in s - band , and short integration times ( @xmath14min ) , made our sensitivity much worse than the @xmath15jy sensitivity reached in the vla follow - up of iptf transients . for comparison ,",
    "the rms of the vla first survey was @xmath16 mjy at 1.4 ghz @xcite and thus , unsurprisingly , almost all radio sources found in the fields ( see table  [ tb : fermi ] ) are also previously cataloged radio sources @xcite .",
    "three radio sources identified in the error region of the possible _",

    "these sources all have 3 ghz peak fluxes @xmath17mjy , that imply a 1.4ghz flux below the @xmath18 detection limit of vla first if we assume a self - absorbed spectral index of @xmath19 .",
    "none of these sources show any significant variation in their radio fluxes over the timescales of our follow - up .",
    "during o1 we have demonstrated our ability in carrying out a well - coordinated multi - band follow - up of advanced ligo triggers .",
    "we have followed - up 16 iptf optical transients out of which 7 showed a significant nearby radio excess associated with host galaxy radio emission .",
    "there were two stripped envelope ( type ib / c ) sne , and one type ibn sn among the iptf transients with a nearby radio detection .",
    "based on the absence of significant variability in the detected radio fluxes , on the radio spectral indices , and on the sfrs derived by combining our vla data with the redshift information provided by optical observations , we found that the all of the detected radio excesses are consistent with star forming regions or agn activity , as also confirmed by _",

    "we have tested our capabilities for the follow - up of the error regions of _",
    "fermi_/lat candidates that are too close to the sun to be accessible to optical or x - ray facilities . in the future",

    "the hope is to detect at least one compact binary with a ns .",
    "advanced virgo should also come online towards the end of o2 , and with a third detector the error areas of ns - ns mergers should be reduced to 200 @xmath25 @xcite . for o2 , our team has a vla program already in place to follow  up iptf - identified transients in advanced ligo error regions .",
    "( we also have an approved _ swift / xrt _ gi program to follow - up the five most promising iptf candidates , with observations that will go deeper than the nasa - led _ swift / xrt _ program aimed at tiling the ligo error regions ; see @xcite ) .",

    "however , as we have demonstrated in this study , combining radio observations with optical and mid - ir ones will likely identify agn - associated variability .",
    "the vla sky survey will also provide soon crucial information about the variability of the radio sky in the ghz range at the @xmath26120 @xmath7jy level .    with plans for commissioning of the zwicky transient facility in 2017 with a 47deg@xmath27 camera , future optical transient searches",
    "will be faster and more sensitive @xcite .",
    "moreover , with kagra and ligo india expected to join the global network in the future , the gw error areas of ns - ns systems will be reduced to tens of deg@xmath27 , and em follow - ups will become much easier @xcite . as advanced",
    "ligo reaches its nominal sensitivity , gw emission from core - collapse events may also come into reach @xcite , although given the complexity of core - collapse progenitor models , equations of state , and explosion physics , the expected rates for these type of signals are highly uncertain .",
    "em detections of gws will provide orders of magnitude better localization , increase the confidence in low significance gw detections , and help constrain source parameters and populations properties . in summary ,",
