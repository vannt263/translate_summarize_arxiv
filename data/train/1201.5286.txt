    "many tools have been developed to detect tightness ; among them , ozsvth and szab s floer - theoretic invariant @xmath0 , living in the ` hat ' flavour of heegaard floer ( co)homology of the underlying manifold : the set of contact structures with @xmath1 sits in a chain of inclusions between the set of stein fillable and the set of tight contact structures @xcite .",

    "we have to stop at @xmath226 without winding multiple times , because there s a region that touches both sides of @xmath1250 ( and also of @xmath1251 ) and the base disc @xmath131 , so the multiplicity of @xmath1254 in that region has to be 0 .",
    "there are two possible segments : one is contained in the plane in figure [ fassotheta0 ] , the other one runs inside the handle . in the first case ,",
    "when we arrive at @xmath226 we have to turn _ left _ ( because of orientations ) and we have to stop at @xmath1270 without running around @xmath1251 multiple times ( because now @xmath1251 touches a region containing the basepoint from both sides ) , and in particular @xmath1254 is the small triangle shaded in figure [ fassotheta0 ] .    in the second case , the domain is an immersed triangle that has multiplicity two on the small triangle region shaded : using sarkar s computation @xcite , we see that this domain gives a contribution to @xmath1271 which is strictly bigger than 1/2 .",
    "suppose now @xmath1272 : reasoning as above , we see that there are only two choices for @xmath1254 , each obtained by adding one of the bigons in @xmath1273 to the small shaded triangle .",
    "again , using sarkar s computation , we see that these domains give a contribution bigger than 1/2 to @xmath1271 .",
    "thanks to the claim and proposition [ associativity ] , we can consider the single triangle count @xmath1276 . in order to achieve admissibility for @xmath1246 , we need to perturb the new @xmath118-curve so that it intersects the new @xmath1243-arc in a pair of canceling points as in figure [ zeromap3 ] .",
    "consider figure [ zeromap3 ] : this is the same part of the diagram of figure [ fassotheta0 ] , but we re now drawing the @xmath118-curve instead of the @xmath92-arc .",
    "we ll argue by contradiction : let @xmath1249 be such a domain .",
    "the two points @xmath1278 and @xmath660 are the only two intersection points on the arc @xmath1226 : reasoning as in claim [ zerolemma ] , the boundary @xmath1279 is the segment between these two points , oriented from @xmath1278 to @xmath660 .",
    "but the region above the segment in figure [ zeromap3 ] touches the base disc @xmath131 , therefore the multiplicity there has to be zero , showing that @xmath1280 .",
    "recall now that proposition [ ass2 ] says that the diagram @xmath1031^{\\psi_{+1}}\\ar[drr]_{\\psi_\\infty } & & sfh(-s^3_{f+1}(k)(1))\\ar[r]^{\\sim } & { \\widehat{hf}}(-s^3_{f+1}(k))\\\\ & & sfh(-s^3(1))\\ar[r]^{\\sim } & { \\widehat{hf}}(-s^3)\\ar[u]^{f_{-w_{f+1 } } } } \\ ] ] commutes .",
    "notice that each of the three maps involved is computed by a triangle count in some triple heegaard diagram .",
    "ozvth and szab @xcite proved that the total cobordism map associated to a contact @xmath335-surgery cobordism @xmath563 carries @xmath199 to @xmath1284 ; more recently , baldwin @xcite proved that there exists a @xmath171-structure @xmath1285 on @xmath563 such that @xmath1286 carries @xmath199 to @xmath1284 .",
    "in proposition [ ass2 ] we do nt worry about @xmath171-structures , and consider the total map only .",
    "let s fix any heegaard diagram @xmath556 for @xmath1287 , attach a 1-handle with feet next to the two basepoints @xmath1288 , and build the three heegaard diagrams involved in the statement in the usual way : all curves except the ones intersecting the core @xmath1224 of the 1-handle are small hamiltonian perturbations one of the other , and @xmath1238 and @xmath1226 are parallel outside a small neigbhourhood of @xmath1226 .",
    "moreover , any two among @xmath1260 and @xmath1261 intersect in one single point . as for the proof of proposition [ ass1",
    "] , we can associate a @xmath1207-element @xmath1237 , @xmath1240 , @xmath1245 to each of the three triple diagrams .",
    "let s consider figure [ fassotheta ] : there are small triangles in the region spanned by @xmath1250 during the hamiltonian isotopy that brings @xmath1250 to @xmath275 and @xmath1251 , as shown in the top part of the figure ; there s also a `` bigger '' triangle , shown in the bottom part of the figure , around the three curves @xmath1294 involved in the surgeries : as before , the domain @xmath1295 obtained by summing these triangular regions gives the summand @xmath1245 .",
    "the situation is very similar to the situation in the proof of lemma [ zerolemma ] : for each index @xmath408 , @xmath1250 intersects @xmath275 , @xmath1251 and no other curve .",
    "moreover , for @xmath1252 , the boundary of every neighbourhood of the area spanned by @xmath1250 under the isotopy lies in a region that touches the base disc @xmath131 , so @xmath1249 can have positive multiplicities in this area only",
    ". in particular , @xmath1253 , with @xmath1254 supported in the spanning region for all @xmath1252 , and @xmath1255 supported near @xmath1226 .",
    "let s consider what happens in the region containing @xmath1260 and @xmath1261 : here all pairwise intersections are fixed , and are @xmath1262 and @xmath1263 .",
    "the base disc @xmath131 lies on @xmath1226 , so one of the two arcs into which @xmath1263 and @xmath1298 divide @xmath1226 ca nt be part of @xmath1264 .",
    "in particular , @xmath1299 has to coincide with @xmath1300 .",
    "also , the big region ( below this arc in the figure ) touches the basepoint , so the multiplicity here has to be 0 , and the multiplicity above it has to be 1 ( we re crossing an arc in @xmath1264 ) , and therefore @xmath1255 coincides with @xmath1295 near @xmath1226 .",
