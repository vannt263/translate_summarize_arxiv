    "nanoparticles,@xcite quantum dots,@xcite colloidal suspensions,@xcite and globular proteins@xcite are examples of physical systems in which small nanometer or micron - sized clusters of particles are suspended in a fluid .",

    "on the other hand , a description in terms of hard spheres would probably be too crude for nanoparticles since typical atomic interaction ranges are on the order of ngstroms .",
    "the aim of this paper is to give a general effective description of nanoparticles which retains a level of detail beyond the hard sphere model and which is intended to be used in the study of the collective behavior of nanoparticles , either numerically or analytically .",
    "the starting point of the description is to assume that each nanoparticle is composed of particles with fixed relative positions , interacting with the point particles in the fluid and their counterparts in other nanoparticles through spherically symmetric pair potentials .",
    "it is furthermore assumed that the nanoparticles may be modeled as spheres with a smooth spherically symmetric density of constituents , which can be viewed as a smoothing procedure for the interactions . in particular , solid and hollow spheres of uniform density",
    "are considered in detail , since these are suitable for describing solid nanoclusters and buckyballs ( or similar structures ) , respectively .",
    "the spherical smoothing procedure results in spherically symmetric effective interaction potentials for nanoparticles and point particles , and consequently leads to a description of a nanoparticle as a single particle instead of as a collection of particles .",
    "similar approaches to the problem of constructing effective potentials have been used before , but only for specific cases.@xcite the current paper is devoted to the general method of deriving effective pair potentials for nanoparticles from the basic pair potential of their constituents .",
    "the possibility of overlapping and embedded particles is specifically treated as well .",

    "this approximation is motivated by the idea that for spherical nanoparticles , the inhomogeneities due to the discreteness of the atoms inside the nanoparticles should only have a small influence on the effective nanoparticle potentials . given a density profile @xmath0 , one can make contact with the picture of a nanoparticle as a cluster of distinct atoms by interpreting @xmath4 as the total number of atoms inside the nanoparticle , where @xmath5 , and @xmath6 denotes that the integration over @xmath7 is over the volume of a ball of radius @xmath3 around zero .    to further illustrate that it is reasonable to smooth out the internal density , consider the idealized case that the atoms composing the nanoparticle are arranged in a face - centered - cubic ( fcc ) lattice  the crystal structure of e.g.  aluminium , silver , gold , and platinum@xcite  with one of the atoms in the center .",
    "the true density inside the nanoparticle is then a sum of delta functions , but this can be coarse - grained by taking a spherical shell of radius @xmath1 with a width @xmath8 , counting the number of atoms in the shell , and dividing by the volume of the shell . the result of such coarse - graining is shown in fig .",

    "a number of interesting extensions present themselves for future research .",
    "for instance , while the nanoparticles were assumed to be composed of one kind of particle only , potentials for nanoparticles composed of several types of particles can also be derived within the current context if the distribution of the types is either homogeneously mixed or distributed in spherical shells ( so - called core - shell nanoparticles@xcite ) . the spherical symmetry of the effective potentials , which decouples the rotational and translational degrees of freedom , could be lifted to extend the model to include rotational motion .",
    "this may be done by adding interaction sites on the surface of the nanoparticle or a multipole expansion .",
    "as long as the orientationally dependent potential is available , there are no obstacles in molecular dynamics simulations of such systems.@xcite furthermore , combining the current model with the mesoscopic fluid model of malevanets and kapral@xcite would yield a numerically efficient model of larger nanoparticles and colloids that includes hydrodynamic effects . these avenues are currently being investigated .",
