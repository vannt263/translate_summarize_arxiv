    "game theory provides a formal framework for studying the interactions of strategic agents .",
    "recently , there has been a surge in research activities that employ game theory to model and analyze a wide range of application scenarios in modern communication networks @xcite-@xcite . in communication networks , any action taken by a single user usually affects the utilities of the other users sharing the same resources . depending on the characteristics of different applications , numerous game - theoretical models and solution concepts",
    "have been proposed to describe the multi - user interactions and optimize the users decisions in communication networks .",
    "roughly speaking , the existing multi - user research can be categorized into two types , non - cooperative games and cooperative games .",
    "various game theoretic solutions were developed to characterize the resulting performance of the multi - user interaction , including the nash equilibrium ( ne ) and the pareto - optimality @xcite .",
    "non - cooperative approaches generally assume that the participating users simply choose actions to selfishly maximize their individual utility functions .",
    "it is well - known that if devices operate in a non - cooperative manner , this will generally limit their performance as well as that of the whole system , because the available resources are not always efficiently exploited due to the conflicts of interest occurring among users @xcite .",
    "most non - cooperative approaches are devoted to investigating the existence and properties of the ne . in particular , several non - cooperative game models , such as s - modular games , congestion games , and potential games , have been extensively applied in various communication scenarios @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the price of anarchy , a measure of how good the system performance is when users play selfishly and reach the ne instead of playing to achieve the social optimum , has also been addressed in several communication network applications @xcite@xcite .    on the other hand , cooperative approaches in communication theory usually focus on studying how users can jointly improve their performance when they cooperate .",
    "for example , the users may optimize a common objective function , which represents the pareto - optimal social welfare allocation rule based on which the system - wide resource allocation is performed @xcite@xcite .",
    "a profile of actions is pareto - optimal if there is no other profile of actions that makes every player at least as well off and at least one player strictly better off .",
    "allocation rules , e.g. network utility maximization , can provide reasonable allocation outcomes by considering the trade - off between fairness and efficiency .",
    "most cooperative approaches focus on studying how to efficiently find the optimum joint policy .",
    "it is worth mentioning that information exchanges among users is generally required to enable users to coordinate in order to achieve and sustain pareto - efficient outcomes .    in this paper",
    ", we present a game model for a particular type of non - cooperative multi - user communication scenario .",
    "we name it linearly coupled communication games , because users utilities are linearly impacted by their competitors actions . in particular , the main contributions of this paper are as follows .",
    "first , based on the assumptions that we make about the properties of users utility , we characterize the inherent structures of the utility functions for the linearly coupled games .",
    "furthermore , based on the derived utility forms , we explicitly quantify the ne and pareto boundary for the linearly coupled communication games .",
    "the price of anarchy incurred by the selfish users playing the nash strategy is quantified .",
    "in addition , to improve the performance in the non - cooperative scenarios , we investigate an alternative solution : conjectural equilibrium ( ce ) . using this approach ,",
    "individual users are modeled as belief - forming agents that develop internal beliefs about their competitors and behave optimally with respect to their individual beliefs .",
    "necessary and sufficient conditions that guarantee the convergence of different dynamic update mechanisms , including the best response and jacobi update , are addressed .",
    "we prove that these adjustment processes based on conjectures and non - cooperative individual optimization can be globally driven to pareto - optimality in the linearly coupled games without the need of real - time coordination information exchange among agents .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii defines the linearly coupled communication games . for the investigated game models , section iii explicitly computes the ne and pareto boundary of the achievable utility region and quantifies the price of anarchy .",
    "section iv introduces the ce and investigates its properties under both the best response and jacobi update dynamics .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section v.",
    "in this section , we first provide a general game - theoretic formulation of the multi - user interaction in communication systems . following the proposed definition ,",
    "we define the linearly coupled communication games and provide concrete examples of the investigated game model .",
    "the multi - user game in various communication scenarios can be formally defined as a tuple @xmath0 . in particular",
    ", @xmath1 is the set of communication devices , which are the rational decision - makers in the system . define @xmath2 to be the joint action space @xmath3 , with @xmath4 being the action set available for user @xmath5 . as opposed to the traditional strategic game definition@xcite",
    ", we introduce two new elements @xmath6 and @xmath7 into the game formulation .",
    "specifically , @xmath6 is the _ state space _ @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the part of the state relevant to user @xmath5 .",
    "the state is defined to capture the effects of the multi - user coupling such that each user s utility solely depends on its own state and action . in other words ,",
    "the utility function @xmath10 is a mapping from the individual users state space and action space to real numbers , @xmath11 .",
    "the state determination function @xmath12 maps joint actions to states for each component @xmath13 . to capture the performance tradeoff , the utility region",

    "assumptions a3 and a4 imply that a user s action has proportionally the same impact over the other users utility .",
    "the structure of the utility functions that satisfy assumptions a1-a4 will be addressed in section iii .",
    "there are a number of multi - user communication scenarios that can be modeled as linearly coupled communication games .",
    "for example , in the random access scenario @xcite , the action of a node is to select its transmission probability and a node @xmath5 will independently attempt transmission of a packet with transmit probability @xmath35 .",

    "the utility function is defined as the weighted ratio of the throughput over the average experienced delay : @xmath42 in which @xmath18 is interpreted as the weighting factor .",

    ", we are interested in comparing the achievable performance attained by different game - theoretic solution concepts . on one hand , it is well - known that ne is generally inefficient in communication games @xcite , but it may not require explicit message exchanges , while pareto - optimality can usually be achieved only by exchanging implicit or explicit coordination messages among the participating users . on the other hand , in several recent works @xcite@xcite , we have applied an alternative solution in different communication scenarios to improve the system performance in non - cooperative settings , namely the conjectural equilibrium @xcite .",
    "the following sections aim to compare the solutions of ne , pareto boundary , and ce in terms of the payoffs and informational requirements in the linearly coupled multi - user interaction satisfying the assumptions a1-a4 .",

    "however , since we require @xmath90 , ( [ eq : eqn24 ] ) holds as strict inequalities , which leads to @xmath140 based on equation ( [ eq : eqn25 ] ) , we can make two important observations .",
    "first , due to the lack of coordination , the ne in type ii games is always strictly pareto inefficient .",
    "second , as opposed to type i games where ne may result in zero utility for certain users @xcite , the efficiency loss in type ii games are lower bounded , which means that every user receives positive payoff at ne .",
    "noticing that the performance gap between @xmath141 and @xmath142 is non - zero , we will investigate how the non - cooperative ce solution can improve the system performance for type ii games .",
    "in game - theoretic analysis , conclusions about the reached equilibria are based on assumptions about what knowledge the players possess .",
    "for example , the standard ne strategy assumes that every player believes that the other players actions will not change at ne .",
    "therefore , it chooses to myopically maximize its immediate payoff @xcite .",
    "therefore , the players operating at equilibrium can be viewed as decision makers behaving optimally with respect to their _ beliefs _ about the strategies of other players .    to avoid detrimental nash strategy and encourage cooperation ,",
    "the conjecture - based model has been introduced by wellman and others @xcite@xcite to enable non - cooperative players to build belief models about how their competitors reactions vary in response to their own action changes .",
    "specifically , each player has some belief about the state that would result from performing its available actions .",
    "the _ belief function _",
    "@xmath143 is defined to be @xmath144 such that @xmath145 represents the state that player @xmath5 believes it would result in if it selects action @xmath25 .",
    "notice that the beliefs are not expressed in terms of other players actions and preferences , and the multi - user coupling in these beliefs is captured indirectly by individual players forming conjectures of the effects of their own actions . by deploying such a behavior model",
    ", players will no longer adopt myopic behaviors that do not forecast @xmath143 , but rather they will form beliefs @xmath145 about how their actions @xmath25 will influence the aggregate effects @xmath143 incurred by their competitors responses and , based on these beliefs , they will choose the action @xmath146 if it believes that this action will maximize its utility .",
    "the steady state of such a play among belief - forming agents can be characterized as a conjectural equilibria .    in the game @xmath46 , a configuration of belief functions @xmath147 and a joint action @xmath148",
    "constitute a conjectural equilibrium , if for each @xmath149 , @xmath150    from the above definition , we can see that , at ce , all players expectations based on their beliefs are realized and each agent behaves optimally according to its expectation . in other words , agents beliefs are consistent with the outcome of the play and they use  conjectured best responses \" in their individual optimization program .",
    "the key challenges are how to configure the belief functions such that cooperation can be sustained in such a non - cooperative setting and how to design the evolution rules such that the communication system can dynamically converge to a ce having satisfactory performance .      as discussed before ,",
    "the belief functions need to be defined in order to investigate the existence of ce . to define the belief functions , we need to express agent @xmath5 s expected state @xmath143 as a function of its own action @xmath25 .",
    "the simplest approach is to design linear belief models for each user , i.e. player @xmath5 s belief function takes the form @xmath151 for @xmath149 .",
    "the values of @xmath152 and @xmath153 are specific states and actions , called _ reference points _ and @xmath154 is a positive scalar . in other words ,",
    "user @xmath5 assumes that other players will observe its deviation from its reference point @xmath153 and the aggregate state deviates from the reference point @xmath152 by a quantity proportional to the deviation of @xmath155 .",
    "how to configure @xmath156 , and @xmath154 will be addressed in the rest of this paper .",

    "as mentioned before , the properties of type i games have been investigated in the context of wireless random access@xcite .",
    "table ii summarizes some similarities and differences between both types of games .",
    "first , the two algorithms exhibit different properties under the best response dynamics . in type i games ,",
    "the stable ce may not be globally convergent .",
    "however , the local stability of a ce implies its global convergence in type ii games .",
    "second , it is shown in @xcite that any operating point that is arbitrarily close to the pareto boundary of the utility region of type i games is a stable ce . similarly , the entire pareto boundary of type ii games is also stable . at last ,",
    "different relationships between the parameter selection and the achieved utility at equilibrium have been observed for the two types of games . in particular , in type",
    "i games , user @xmath5 s utility @xmath16 is approximately proportional to the inverse of the parameter @xmath154 in its belief function . in contrast , in type ii games , if the ce is pareto - optimal , the ratio @xmath282 coincide with the weight @xmath289 assigned to user @xmath5 in the proportional fairness objective function . in other words ,",
    "based on the definition of proportional fairness @xcite , we know @xmath290 in which @xmath291 is the users achieved utility associated with any other feasible joint action and @xmath292 is the optimal achieved utility for problem ( [ eq : eqnop ] ) with @xmath293 and @xmath90 .      in order to achieve pareto - optimality , information exchanges among users is generally required in order to collaboratively maximize the system efficiency .",
    "the existing cooperative communication scenarios either assume that the information about all the users is gathered by a trusted moderator ( e.g. access point , base station , selected network leader etc . ) , to which it is given the authority to centrally divide the available resources among the participating users , or , in the distributed setting , users exchange price signals ( e.g. the lagrange multipliers for the dual problem ) that reflect the  cost \" for consuming per unit constrained resources to maximize the social welfare and reach pareto - optimal allocations . as an important tool , the pricing mechanism has been applied in the distributed optimization of various communication networks @xcite .",
    "however , we would like to point out that , the pricing mechanism generally requires repeated coordination information exchange among users in order to determine the optimal actions and achieve the pareto - optimality .",
    "in contrast , for the linear coupled communication games , since the specific structure of the utility function is explored , the ce approach is able to calculate the pareto efficient operating point in a distributed manner , without any real - time information exchange among users .",
    "in fact , the underlying coordination is implicitly implemented when the participating users initialize their belief parameters .",
    "once the belief parameters are properly initialized by the protocol according to ( [ eq : eqn40 ] ) , using the proposed dynamic update algorithms , individual users are able to achieve the pareto - optimal ce solely based on their individual local observations on their states and no message exchange is needed during the convergence process .",
    "therefore , the conjecture equilibrium approach is an important alternative to the pricing - based approach in the linearly coupled games .",
    "we derive the structure of the utility functions in the multi - user communication scenarios where a user s action has proportionally the same impact over other users utilities .",
    "the performance gap between ne and pareto boundary of the utility region is explicitly characterized . to improve the performance in non - cooperative cases , we investigate a ce approach which endows users with simple linear beliefs which enables them to select an equilibrium outcome that is efficient without the need of explicit message exchanges .",
    "the properties of the ce under both the best response and jacobi dynamic update mechanisms are characterized .",
    "we show that the entire pareto boundary in linearly coupled games is globally convergent ce which can be achieved by both studied dynamic algorithms without the need of real - time message passing .",
    "a potential future direction is to see how to extend the ce approach to the general linearly coupled games that are compositions of the basic two types and certain particular non - linearly coupled multi - user communication scenarios .",
