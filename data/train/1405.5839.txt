    "( [ eq:18 ] ) - ( [ eq:20 ] ) are functions of @xmath148 , @xmath159 , @xmath160 , @xmath161 and @xmath162 , as well as ( with the exception of @xmath149 ) of the scattering variables .",
    "for example , the components normal to the beam line in the horizontal plane of @xmath151 and @xmath153 respectively ( called here @xmath168 and @xmath169 , respectively ) are given by the expressions @xmath170 and @xmath171 , while @xmath172 and @xmath173 , where @xmath174 ( @xmath175 ) is the percentage difference between the momentum of the scattered electron ( produced kaon ) and the central momentum of the hrs electron arm ( hrs hadron arm ) , @xmath176 ( @xmath177 ) is the angle between the electron ( produced kaon ) direction in the horizontal plane , and @xmath161 ( @xmath162 ) , @xmath178 ( @xmath179 ) are the angles between the electron ( produced kaon ) direction in the vertical plane and the cebaf beam line , and @xmath180 is the kaon mass .",
    "for the kinematics of the experiment e94 - 107 ( see the nominal values of @xmath148 , @xmath150 , and @xmath152 at the end of this appendix ) or if @xmath183 , the change in the binding - energy spectrum @xmath157 caused by the kinematical uncertainties is @xmath184 where @xmath185 and @xmath186 the term @xmath187 does not depend on the target mass and causes a global shift of the binding - energy spectrum without changing the peak shapes and relative positions , while the term @xmath25 is equal to zero only when @xmath188 .",
    "when this condition is not fulfilled , the main effect of @xmath25 on the binding - energy spectrum is to broaden the peaks because , in this case , depending on scattering variables through @xmath189 , it produces non - zero , scattering variable dependent values of @xmath157 and , as a consequence , an unphysical dependence on the scattering variables of the binding energy that broadens the peaks corresponding to the bound states .",
    "because of the presence of the coefficient @xmath190 , the effect of @xmath25 on the position of the peaks is negligibly small .",
    "the actual values of @xmath148 , @xmath159 , @xmath160 , @xmath161 , and @xmath162 are hence those for which @xmath191 ( which places a peak at its known position in the binding energy spectrum and minimizes its fwhm ) .    to determine the @xmath2 binding energy of the hypernucleus produced in the reaction @xmath77be@xmath7 , we took advantage of the fact that the experiment used the same set - up employed for the study of the hypernucleus .",
    "the values of @xmath148 , @xmath159 , @xmath160 , @xmath161 , and @xmath162 were thus the same in the productions of both and and were determined by positioning the ground state at its known position of @xmath192 mev  @xcite in the binding - energy spectrum and minimizing its fwhm .",
    "when minimizing the ground - state fwhm , it has to be taken into account that this ground state is actually a doublet whose energy splitting , assumed to be equal to the ground - state energy splitting , is 161.6 @xmath4 0.2 kev  @xcite .",
    "minimizing the ground - state fwhm implies hence some sort of distortion because it artificially narrows the positions of the peaks making up the doublet .",
    "however , the ground - state doublet energy splitting is small enough with respect to the energy resolution of the experiment to make the approximation of assuming the ground state as a single peak still valid .",
    "no attempt to minimize the fwhm was performed on the other peaks of the binding - energy spectrum .",
    "another possibile source of distortion comes from the term @xmath25 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:24 ] ) , which , although small because of the presence of the factor @xmath193 in it ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq:26 ] ) ) , can potentially change the positions of the excited states with respect to each other and with respect to the ground state . during all the process of minimization of the kinematical uncertainties , the positions of the peaks of the energy spectrum as resulted by a fitting procedure were checked to ensure that the relative peak positions did not change within the errors ( the error of a position peak being defined as the standard deviation resulting by the fitting procedure ) .",
    "it has to be stressed that the term @xmath187 in the expression of @xmath157 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq:24 ] ) dominates because of the presence of the factor @xmath193 in the term @xmath25 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq:26 ] ) ) .",
    "the positioning of the ground state at its known value in the binding spectrum was thus mainly performed choosing a set of values @xmath163 , @xmath164 , and @xmath165 that produced a value of @xmath187 equal to the difference between the measured and the expected position of the ground state .",
    "the minimization of the ground state peak fwhm produces only second order effects on the position of the peaks in the binding - energy spectrum and was peformed mainly to choose the right set of values @xmath163 , @xmath164 , and @xmath165 among the @xmath194 sets of values that produced the desired value of @xmath187 .",
    "things are much different for the reaction @xmath16 , where the target mass is small and the minimization of the fwhm of the peak ( which is a single peak ) plays a role as important as the positioning of the peak in the binding - energy spectrum to its zero value .",
    "the procedure described above resulted in the set of values @xmath195 mev , @xmath196 mev , @xmath197 mev , @xmath198 , and @xmath199 . replacing with these values the nominal ones @xmath200 mev , @xmath201 mev , @xmath202 mev , @xmath203 , and @xmath204 ) in the @xmath205 expression , a value of @xmath206 ( stat . )",
    "mev was obtained for the ground state .",
    "the statistical error of @xmath207 mev is the error in the position of the first peak in the four - gaussian fit of the binding - energy spectrum ( see fig .",
    "[ databe ] and table  [ tab : results ] ) .",
    "when evaluating the systematic error of the binding energy , one has to consider that , as quoted above , the term @xmath187 in @xmath157 dominates the effects of the term @xmath25 .",
    "when neglecting the energy loss in the target , this means that if the single values of @xmath163 , @xmath164 , and @xmath165 were wrong , the binding energy would not be affected significantly as long as the sum @xmath187 ( and hence the position of the ground state ) is correctly reproduced .",
    "the major source of systematic error is hence due to the energy loss in the target .",
    "the difference between the shifts of the ground - state position in the and binding - energy spectra due to the energy loss in the targets of @xmath11c and @xmath0be , respectively , was evaluated to be equal to @xmath208 kev through the use of the monte carlo code simc  @xcite .",
    "this value was added in quadrature to the error of @xmath209 kev quoted for the ground - state binding energy  @xcite to give a @xmath210 kev systematic error on the binding energy .",
