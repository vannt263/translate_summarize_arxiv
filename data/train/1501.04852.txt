    "the fundamental difficulties in merging quantum theory with gravitation theory are well known . we know that the beauty of black hole thermodynamics lies in the powerful way it speaks of the unity of physics . to find answers to the difficulties , plenty of studies",
    "are going on by applying the known laws of quantum mechanics to general relativity . as a result of these studies",
    ", it is found that it is very difficult to study the systems in four dimensions .",
    "so enormous studies have been done on lower dimensional gravity theories .",
    "string theory is one approach to quantum gravity .",
    "the developments in string theory have provided a good framework to consider the quantum properties of the black holes .",
    "the low energy string theory has several black hole solutions @xcite .",
    "the study of lower dimensional black hole systems will help us to address many problems that arise in higher dimensional quantum gravity models .",
    "hence several studies have been done in black hole thermodynamics of two dimensional gravity models .",
    "in addition , from these understandings as well as using black hole / string correspondence principle one can understand the conceptual issues regarding the microscopic origin of black hole entropy .    in recent years",
    "the dilatonic black holes have gained much attention , because it is widely believed that , the investigations on this black hole solution will lead to an exact explanation of microscopic origin of black hole entropy ( bekenstein - hawking entropy ) @xcite .",
    "also there exists some conceptual problems regarding the end point of black hole evaporation through thermal radiation @xcite .",
    "the two dimensional einstein - hilbert action is just a gauss - bonnet term , a topological invariant in the two dimensional space time .",
    "so the two dimensional models are locally trivial .",
    "hence it is necessary to introduce some extra fields to this model .",
    "the best candidate for this is the dilaton field , which arises in the compactifications from higher dimensional models or from string theory .",
    "this theory also possesses different black hole solutions .",
    "these solutions play an important role in our understanding of quantum gravity .",
    "now , as pointed out in @xcite , higher dimensional black holes in string theory can be related to two dimensional solutions through u - duality .",
    "hence the higher dimensional black holes in string theory @xcite are related to many two dimensional solutions including the two dimensional charged black holes of mcguigan , nappi and yost @xcite . in the present study the two dimensional dilatonic black hole",
    "is considered which is analogous to the above mentioned two dimensional string black hole .",
    "bekenstein @xcite proposed that the horizon area of a non extremal black hole is an adiabatic invariant , quantities which vary very slowly compared to the variation of the external perturbation of the system , and the horizon area of black hole is quantized in units of planck length . as a result of this",
    ", much attention has been given to the entropy spectrum quantization .",
    "many methods have been put forward to calculate this entropy spectrum spacing .",
    "first method in this direction was introduced by hod @xcite .",
    "this method relies on quasinormal modes and the corresponding frequency .",
    "hod employed bohr s correspondence principle to quantize the entropy and found that in the asymptotic limit , it is related to the real part of quasinormal frequencies",
    ". later kunstatter @xcite derived an equally spaced entropy spectrum for schwarzschild black hole .",
    "for this derivation , the quantity @xmath1 was taken as the adiabatic invariant , where @xmath2 is the energy and @xmath3 is the real part of the quasinormal frequency .",
    "maggiore in 2007 @xcite refined the idea of hod by proving that the physical frequency of the quasinormal modes is determined by its real and imaginary parts .",
    "recently majhi and vagenas @xcite proposed a new method to quantize the entropy without using quasinormal modes .",
    "they used the idea of connecting adiabatic invariant quantity to the hamiltonian of the black hole , and they obtained an equally spaced entropy spectrum .",
    "jiang and han @xcite modified this idea by pointing the fact that , the adiabatic invariant quantity @xmath4 used in majhi and vagenas s method is not canonically invariant .",
    "therefore they made the modification by using the adiabatic invariant quantity of the covariant form @xmath5 .",
    "we adopt this method to quantize the entropy of the two dimensional stringy black hole .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in sec.[thermo ] , we introduce the two dimensional charged dilatonic black hole solution and discuss the thermodynamics of the corresponding black hole . in sec.[entropyformalism ] , we obtain the entropy of the black hole via euclidean treatment of quantum gravity and also the entropy spectrum and the corresponding spacing is studied .",
    "paper concludes with a short discussion of the results in sec.[conclusion ]",
    "the action corresponding to maxwell - gravity coupled to a dilatonic field ( @xmath6 ) can be described by @xcite @xmath7 in which @xmath8 is the ricci scalar , @xmath9 is the effective central charge and @xmath10 is the electromagnetic field tensor .",
    "the equations of motion corresponding to the metric , gauge and dilaton fields are respectively given by , @xmath11 the solution to the equation of motion leads to the two dimensional dilatonic black hole , whose metric is given by , @xmath12 with the metric function , @xmath13 the dilaton field , @xmath14 and the electromagnetic field tensor as , @xmath15 the condition of asymptotic flatness for the spacetime requires @xmath16 . in these equations",
    "@xmath17 and @xmath18 are proportional to black hole mass and black hole charge respectively .",
    "then the horizons are located at , @xmath19 from the above expression it is evident that , in order to have an event horizon at @xmath20 , the condition @xmath21 has to be satisfied .",
    "the solution given by ( [ fofr ] ) is analogous to the string theoretic black hole @xcite .",
    "so we are calling this particular black hole solution as two dimensional charged `` stringy '' black holes .",
    "now we will investigate the thermodynamic aspects of charged stringy black hole . from ( [ fofr ] ) , and using the condition @xmath22 , at the horizon , we can deduce the mass of the black hole as , @xmath23 the temperature of the two dimensional charged dilatonic black hole or stringy black hole can be derived using the relation , @xmath24 where the surface gravity @xmath25 is defined as , @xmath26 this yields the hawking temperature as @xmath27 and when the charge of the string becomes zero , the temperature will reduce to @xmath28 the variation of hawking temperature with respect to mass of the black hole is depicted in fig.([temp_stringy ] ) . from the thermodynamic relation , @xmath29 ,",
    "one can arrive at the specific heat of the black hole as , @xmath30 and the corresponding variation with respect to mass of the black hole is plotted in fig.([spec_stringy ] ) . from these two figures",
    "it is evident that the two dimensional dilatonic stringy black hole does not undergo any kind of phase transition .",
    "ernst ising solved the 1d ising model in 1925 and found that there is no phase transition in 1d systems .",
    "we can see that these results match with the @xmath0 dimensional dilatonic stringy black hole system .",
    "this system also shows no phase transition .",
    "so this black hole behaves like a 1d ising model system as far as thermodynamic behaviours are considered .",
    "as we mentioned in the introduction , the best way to study the thermodynamics of gravitational field is via the euclidean treatment of quantum gravity . the partition function that explains the black hole thermodynamics",
    "is evaluated as the euclidean path integral over the space of all field configurations with the saddle point approximation around the black hole solution @xcite .",
    "it is found that the entropy of the black hole under consideration is originated from the above mentioned euclidean path integral calculations . by following similar arguments one can perform an analysis to obtain the entropy of a two dimensional dilatonic stringy black hole .",
    "this analysis can begin by writing the partition function as , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the action evaluated for the euclideanized gravitational field , @xmath33 is the inverse temperature , and @xmath34 is the helmholtz free energy , @xmath35 .",
    "so this equation implies that the euclidean action evaluated on the black hole system can be identified as inverse temperature times the free energy of the system . here",
    "the euclidean action is given by , @xmath36 where @xmath37 s are the chemical potentials which correspond to @xmath38 s , which are the charges . from the wick - rotated form of ( [ action ] )",
    ", the euclidean minisuperspace action can be constructed . from this construction",
    "the corresponding black hole entropy can be calculated by comparing it with the partition function and it is given by @xmath39 now it can be also possible to write down the adm mass of the black hole as described in @xcite as , @xmath40 this mass relation can also be derived by adopting the derivation of arnowitt , deser and misner @xcite .",
    "it is also found that this adm mass agrees with the thermodynamic evolution of energy .",
    "now one can arrive at an expression , where @xmath41 as a function of adm mass ( @xmath42 ) and electric charge ( @xmath43 ) as follows , @xmath44 where the electric charge is given by , @xmath45    obviously one can expect a matching between this result and that of near extremal @xmath46 type black holes as considered in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath46 type black hole solution is given by , @xmath47 now let us consider the near horizon limit of extremal black holes in above equation using @xmath48 condition . in this case we can find the black hole entropy as , @xmath49    now it can be shown from ( [ entropyredefine ] ) that the entropy of the flat dilatonic black hole agrees with the entropy ( [ entropyredefineads ] ) of the near extremal limit of @xmath46 type black hole solution @xcite .",
    "now we will quantize the entropy of the two dimensional dilatonic stringy black hole via the adiabatic invariance and bohr - sommerfeld quantization rule . according to the tunneling picture , when a particle tunnels in or out",
    ", the black hole horizon will oscillate due to the gain or loss of the black hole mass @xcite .",
    "such oscillating horizon can be studied using the adiabatic invariant quantity , @xmath50 where @xmath51 or @xmath52 is the conjugate momentum corresponding to the coordinate @xmath53 or @xmath54 , respectively , and @xmath55 . for the horizon of a black hole @xmath56 and @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the euclidean time and",
    "@xmath59 is the horizon radius . by implementing the hamilton s equation @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the hamilton of the system , the integral",
    "can be rewritten as ,    @xmath62    where @xmath63 is the oscillating velocity of the black hole horizon .",
    "we know that the tunneling and oscillation take place at the same time .",
    "hence we can write the relation connecting the black hole horizon oscillating velocity and velocity of the tunneling particle as @xcite , @xmath64 the metric given by ( [ metric1 ] ) is euclideanized by introducing the transformation @xmath65 .",
    "let a photon travel across the black hole horizon , then the radial geodesic is given by , @xmath66 where the @xmath67 and @xmath68 sign correspond to the outgoing and ingoing paths , respectively .",
    "now the action given in equation ( [ adiabatic covariant action ] ) can be written as , @xmath69 using the near horizon approximation , @xmath70 can be taylor expanded as , @xmath71 we also know that at the horizon @xmath72 there is a pole . to avoid this we consider a contour integral in such a way that the half loop is going above the pole from right to left . evaluating the adiabatic invariant integral ( [ adiabatic invariant integral_stringy ] ) using the cauchy s integral theorem , we can arrive at , @xmath73 where @xmath25 is the surface gravity of the black hole and it is related to the hawking temperature by the relation @xmath74 .",
    "we can write the smarr formula of the two dimensional dilatonic stringy black hole as , @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the electrostatic potential .",
    "then ( [ adiabatic invariant integral_temp ] ) becomes , @xmath77 where @xmath78 .",
    "bohr - sommerfeld quantization rule is given by , @xmath79 comparing the above two equations , ( [ adiabatic invariant integral_1 ] ) and ( [ bohr sommerfeld quantization rule ] ) , one can write the entropy spectrum as , @xmath80 using equation ( [ adm mass ] ) , we can rewrite the entropy spectrum in terms of adm mass of the black hole as , @xmath81 it is interesting to note that the entropy of the two dimensional dilatonic stringy black holes is quantized . from the above relation ( [ entropy_spectra_adm ] ) , it is evident that the entropy spectra depends on the value of the dilatonic field at the horizon , as @xmath82 .",
    "hence we may conclude that there is a background entropy due to this dilatonic field .",
    "in this work we have calculated the entropy of a @xmath0 dimensional dilatonic stringy black hole via the euclidean treatment of quantum gravity .",
    "we have studied the thermodynamics of the black hole . by calculating the temperature and heat capacity of the black hole",
    "we conclude that the present black hole system does not undergo any kind of phase transition .",
    "this behaviour matches with the one dimensional ising model system in statistical studies @xcite .",
    "we have investigated the quantization of entropy of @xmath0 dimensional dilatonic stringy black holes via adiabatic invariant integral method put forward by majhi and vagenas , as well as the bohr - sommerfeld quantization rule .",
    "we have found that the entropy spectrum is quantized and also that the entropy spectrum depends on black hole parameters : electric charge , adm mass and dilatonic field .",
    "this is supported by the area law in higher dimensional theory of gravity . by considering the two dimensional dilaton theory as the dimensional reduction from higher dimensional theories",
    ", one can conclude that the dilaton field is associated with the radius of the compactified coordinates . at this point",
    ", it is interesting enough to recall the ideas of inflationary cosmology @xcite which imply the presence of a scalar field that drives the inflation .",
    "here we can match this scalar field with the dilaton field .",
    "the dependence of entropy spectrum on dilatonic field points towards the microscopic origin of the black hole entropy and hence towards quantum gravity .",
    "this dilatonic field can also be considered as the source which drives the inflation in the context of inflationary cosmology .",
    "so further studies on these black hole solutions can unfold the mysteries regarding the inflationary stage of the universe and also the microscopic origin of bekenstein - hawking entropy .",
