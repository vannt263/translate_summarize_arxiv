    "the large  scale structure of the universe , and in particular the largest virialized systems , are a key probe of the evolution of the density field from the primordial fluctuations , and consequently of the nature of the energy content of the universe and the long range action of gravity .",
    "thanks to the widely available galaxy redshift surveys performed in the last years , as las campanas redshift survey @xcite , the 2-degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we know that the large  scale structure of the universe appears as a network made up of walls , filaments , knots and voids @xcite .",
    "the nodes are the intersections of walls and filaments , so they are the highest density regions .",
    "it is these regions , or some part of them , which we call superstructures . in a cosmological model , where the dynamics of the universe is expected to be dominated by the accelerated expansion",
    ", superstructures can be defined as the currently overdense regions that will be bound and virialized systems in the future @xcite .",
    "these superstructures provide important information about the matter distribution on cosmological scales , allowing precise analysis of the cosmological model @xcite .",
    "the clustering properties of galaxies on scales smaller than the size of superstructures are key to observationally constrain the accretion processes that give rise to luminous galaxies @xcite . in this context , the local environment is claimed to be the principal factor in defining the global properties of galaxies and their distribution @xcite .    in fact , several models of galaxy formation assume that galaxy properties are determined by the haloes where they formed , and not by the large scale environment that surrounds them @xcite . in this context , the population of galaxies in a halo of a given mass should be independent of the location of the halo .",
    "however , in the last years there were different studies , both observational and using simulations , which show that the galaxy properties , such as the star formation rate or galaxy colours , depend on large  scale structure @xcite .",
    "the formation and evolution of systems that are embedded in superstructures could be conditioned by these large overdensities ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "galaxies within them also show different properties and spatial distributions @xcite .",
    "recent galaxy redshift surveys @xcite sample a sufficiently large volume to allow the study of galaxy formation and evolution from a statistical perspective and unveil its details with increasing confidence .",
    "the aim of this work is to use sdss ",
    "dr7 catalogue @xcite to study the influence of superstructures on galaxies .",
    "we will study the dependence of the clustering of faint galaxies ( tracers , ) around brighter galaxies ( centres , ) according to whether the centre galaxies are part of superstructures . in this work , we will analyse the clustering properties of galaxies located in large structures which are still undergoing a virialization process",
    ". then we can study the differences in the small scale clustering of these galaxies compared to galaxies in the field .",
    "for this study , we use the superstructures identified by @xcite , dubbed future virialized structures ( fvs ) , identified in the sdss ",
    "dr7 and @xcite groups which will be used to characterize the virial mass of the groups which host our galaxies .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ s_data ]",
    "we describe data collected for groups of galaxies and future virialized structures .",
    "we then analyse the clustering properties using the cross - correlation function , as described in section [ s_method ] , and show results in section [ s_results ] .",
    "we summarize and discuss the results in section [ s_conclusus ] .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey @xcite is one of the largest and most ambitious surveys carried out so far .",
    "it has deep multi  colour images covering more than one quarter of the sky , and spectra for about 930000 galaxies and 120000 quasars .",
    "it is one of the largest data sets produced and contains images , image catalogues , spectra and redshifts . in this work we use the seventh data release ( dr7 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is publicly available .",
    "the spectroscopic galaxy catalogue comprises a footprint area of 9380 sq.deg . the limiting apparent magnitude for the spectroscopic catalogue in the r ",
    "band is 17.77 @xcite .",
    "we use a more conservative limit of @xmath0 to ensure completeness .",
    "also , in order to avoid saturation effects in the photometric pipeline , we consider galaxies fainter than .",
    "the image deblending software often fragments images of bright galaxies with substructure , so our cuts prevent possible artifacts in the final catalogue .",
    "the maps of the universe depict a complex network of filaments and voids ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where clusters of galaxies are preferentially located at the nodes of filamentary structures @xcite .",
    "this picture was possible only after extended galaxy surveys were completed , and it is also supported by numerical experiments consistent with the standard cosmological model @xcite .",
    "large scale structures , which we will refer to as superstructures , have been studied with a variety of methods .",
    "the first statistical studies of superstructures were performed by linking abell cluster positions @xcite .",
    "later , the realization of wide - area surveys of galaxies with redshift as las campanas redshift survey @xcite , the 2-degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , allowed the identification of superstructures directly from the large - scale galaxy distribution .",
    "@xcite identified superclusters in the 2dfgrs using a density field method , and @xcite studied the morphology of superclusters of galaxies in the sdss .",
    "the largest catalogue of superclusters has been constructed by @xcite , who implemented the density field method on the sdss ",
    "dr7 main and luminous red galaxy samples . in all cases , superclusters are operationally defined as objects within a region of positive galaxy density contrast , and thus are subject to a certain degree of arbitrariness in their detection .    within the concordance cosmological model , an accelerated expansion dominates the present and future dynamics of the universe and thus determines the nature of gravitationally bound structures .",
    "therefore , an alternative definition of these large - scale structures is that of overdense regions in the present - day universe that will become bound and virialized structures in the future .",
    "thus , under the assumption that the luminosity is a somewhat unbiased tracer of mass on large scales , the integrated luminosity density of galaxies is commonly used as an indicator of mass density .",
    "@xcite applies the luminosity density field method to identify fvs in large spectroscopic galaxy surveys .",
    "the identification procedure is based on the theoretical criteria of @xcite .",
    "using numerical simulations , they establish the minimum mass overdensity neccesary for a structure to remain bound in the future .",
    "@xcite use this mass overdensity criteria to calibrate the luminosity  density threshold , and identify superstructures as systems that are likely to evolve into virialized structures in the distant future , in the assumed cosmology .",
    "the catalogue of fvs was extracted from a volume - limited sample of galaxies from the sdss ",
    "dr7 , in the redshift range , with a limiting absolute magnitude of . the luminosity - density field is constructed on cubic cells grid , applying an epanechnikov kernel of ( equation 3 of @xcite ) .",
    "the luminosity overdensity threshold is fixed at , and the structures are constructed by linking overdense cells with a simple version of a  friends of friends  algorithm . in order to avoid contamination from smaller systems , they also assign a lower limit for the total luminosity of a structure at .",
    "the main catalogue of superstructures has completness over 90 per cent and contamination below 5 per cent , according to calibrations made using mock catalogues .",
    "the volume covered by the catalogue is , within which 150 superstructures were identified , composed by a total of 11394 galaxies .",
    "fvs luminosites vary between and , and their volumes range between and . because of the luminosity density field dependence , @xcite analysed 3 samples with different luminosity thresholds , dubbed s1 , s2 and s3 , described in of their paper .",
    "we will consider sample s2 in our analysis , which contains 89513 galaxies with in the redshift range .",
    "the aim of this paper is to analyse the clustering of galaxies considering different samples .",
    "some of these samples are selected taking into account the mass of the systems considered . to estimate the mass distributions of the samples we use the estimated mass of galaxy groups .",
    "the galaxy groups correspond to those identified in the sdss galaxy catalogue presented by @xcite , extended to cover the sdss  dr7 .",
    "@xcite identified groups using the same method as , with a  friends of friends  algorithm , with a variable projected linking length and a fixed radial linking length .",
    "these were set by merchan @xmath1 zandivarez to obtain a sample as complete as possible and with low contamination ( 95 per cent and 8 per cent , respectively ) .",
    "the catalogue contains 83784 groups with at least 4 members , and is limited to redshift .      in order to test the procedures implemented in this work , we constructed a mock galaxy catalogue from a semi - analytic model of galaxy formation ( galform , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) applied to the millennium simulation @xcite , which adopts a concordance cosmological model .",
    "the semi - analytic model of galaxy formation collects information from the merger trees extracted from the simulation , and generates a population of galaxies within the simulation box .",
    "the mock catalogue is set up to mimic the geometry of the sdss ",
    "dr7 footprint and reproduces the dilution in the number of galaxies with redshift .",
    "the clustering of galaxies is analysed using the two  point correlation function .",
    "early studies of the spatial distribution of galaxies using this technique were presented by @xcite .",
    "the two  point correlation function , @xmath2 , is defined as the excess of the probability , @xmath3 , of finding a galaxy , defined as _ tracer _",
    ", at a given distance from another galaxy , dubbed the _",
    "centre_. thus ,    @xmath4    where @xmath5 is a volume element and @xmath6 is the mean number density of tracer galaxies .",
    "there are several estimators of this function @xcite that compute this probability by counting object pairs . in this work ,",
    "we use one of the most commonly used estimators to determine the cross  correlation function , as defined by @xcite :    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the average number of object pairs and @xmath9 is the average number of pairs in a random sample . @xmath10 and",
    "@xmath11 represent the number of objects in the data catalogue and in the random sample , respectively .",
    "the random sample is generated with the same geometry as the real catalogue using the same angular and radial selection functions .",
    "in particular , the advantage of this estimator is that if the sample @xmath12 has few objects , @xmath13 can be selected to be larger than @xmath12 , and thus minimize the noise in the @xmath14 calculation .",
    "although there are more accurate estimators , like the one defined by @xcite , differences between both estimators are negligible due to the large volume size of the sdss ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in galaxy redshift catalogues , where the distance is estimated using the spectroscopic redshift which includes a peculiar velocity component ,",
    "the three dimensional distribution of galaxies is affected by distortions in the line of sight . to take this into account we estimate the correlation function , as a function of the projected ( @xmath15 ) and line of sight ( @xmath16 ) distances .",
    "as these distortions in redshift space occur only in the radial direction , we implement the inversion presented by @xcite to obtain the spatial correlation function @xmath17 from .",
    "we integrate along the line of sight to obtain the projected correlation function @xmath18 :    @xmath19    in this work we use @xmath20 and @xmath21 mpc as lower integration limits for this equation , and @xmath22 and @xmath23 mpc as upper limits .",
    "we use diferent binning schemes for @xmath24 according to the size of each sample , being the number of bins in the range 13 to 19 .    then , we can directly estimate the real space correlation function ( ) by the inversion of @xmath18 assuming a step function @xmath25 in bins centered in @xmath26 and interpolating between @xmath27 values ( equation 26 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) :    @xmath28    this equation is a simple and direct way to invert the projected correlation function .    in addition , we also compute the correlation function in redshift space , @xmath29 , where is the redshift - space distance ; and @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the line of sight distances to each object of the pair , with angular separation given by @xmath32 .",

    "the interpretation for this result is that the positions of the centres used for the measurement of the correlation function trace , on average , the location of the overdensity of the fvs .",
    "we test this hipothesis by measuring the centre of mass of the fvs using low and high mass groups living in them ( we define low mass groups as , and high mass groups as ) .",
    "we find that the centres of mass are similar to within , which explains the small effect of the centres on the amplitude of the correlation function at large separations .",

    ", we also divided the sample of fvs in two , one for low and another for high fvs mass samples , and calculated the cross - correlation function between groups populating these samples and tracer galaxies .",
    "as before , we ensure that the mass distributions of the groups are similar , to avoid the possible influence of the group mass on the amplitude of the correlation sample ( even though we already showed that this is negligible when groups reside in an fvs ) .",
    "we find indications that the clustering for groups in higher mass fvss is higher , also lending more support to the results shown previously .",
    "regarding smaller scales , those corresponding to the one  halo term , our analysis indicates that the differences in the clustering amplitude , taking into account whether galaxies reside in fvs or not , are the sum of several contributions .",
    "we identified at least two sources that may be responsible for these differences , i.e. , the different clustering amplitude due to galaxy luminosity and galaxy host mass selection effects .",
    "we acknowledge that there may be other sources that contribute to this deviation related to the selection of distinct large  scale environments .",

    "correlation clustering of bright and faint galaxies on large scale structures is a generic feature of galaxy clustering in hierarchical scenarios and our current understanding of galaxy formation scenario .",
