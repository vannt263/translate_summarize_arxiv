    "and references therein .    the effect of thermal noise on the properties of josephson junctions made from _ low - temperature _ superconductors , and in particular on the critical current and voltage - current curves , has been investigated experimentally and theoretically in many publications , see ref .. for _ high - temperature _ superconductors considerable interest has been attracted to the problems of thermal fluctuations in the vortex state , see ref . , but , to our knowledge , no detailed study of the influence of thermal fluctuations on the critical current and current - voltage curves of mesoscopic intrinsic josephson junctions has been carried out .",
    "some fluctuation effects are reported recently in ref ..    in our paper we present the results of experimental and theoretical investigations of small area intrinsic josephson junctions , when the josephson energy is of the order of @xmath1 ( @xmath4 is the boltzmann constant ) . for temperatures @xmath5 thermal fluctuations",
    "become important .",
    "this cross - over temperature can be estimated with help of fig.[vergleich ] , where the ambegaokar - baratoff temperature dependence of the critical current density @xmath6 is plotted together with the linear functions @xmath7 ( marked as @xmath8 in the figure ) for mesas with different area @xmath9 .",

    "= 0.9    we discuss in the following junctions with cross - over temperatures in the range of 10 - 60 k .",
    "note that for all our samples the charging energy is still small compared to @xmath11 , such that quantum effects ( coulomb blockade and quantum tunneling ) are not essential . from the behaviour of the current - voltage characteristics of the junctions",
    "three temperature regimes can be distinguished . at low temperatures , @xmath12 , straight lines with hysteretic jumps to other resistive branches",
    "are observed ( see fig.[vcc-1 ] and fig.[vcc-4 ] ) . at temperature",
    "@xmath13 the current voltage curves are bended near the critical current ( like in fig.[vcc-3 ] and fig.[pd - branch ] ) , but still some hysteresis is found . at high temperatures , @xmath14 , no more jumps in the current voltage curve occur and no real critical current exists , but still a maximum in the curvature can be distinguished ( see fig.[vcc-2 ] ) , which can be regarded as maximum of the supercurrent . in order to describe all temperature regimes together",
    "we introduce the concept of a `` switching '' current , which will be defined below .",
    "it replaces the critical current in the non - hysteretic high - temperature regime . a plot of the switching current as function of temperature shows a rather non - monotonic behaviour , which is very different from the ab - curve found for the critical current of large junctions .",
    "we will show below that the temperature dependence of the switching current , in particular the sharp drop , can be explained by phase diffusion processes .",
    "this will be done with help of an extended rsj model containing thermal current noise and the coupling to an external rc circuit ( fig.[rsj+ ] ) .",
    "the latter is necessary to obtain the observed hysteretic behaviour for the phase diffusion branch at intermediate temperatures @xmath15 . in our case",
    "the external rc circuit is formed most probably by a large capacitance between the ground superconducting layer and the upper electrode together with the resistance of the contact between mesa and upper electrode .",

    "this equation can be written in dimensionless form as @xmath24 @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is the characteristic frequency .    here",

    "the phase diffusion branch in the model with frequency - dependent damping is shown ( circles ) together with the usual rsj curve at similar parameters ( triangles ) .",
    "the phase diffusion branch can be found numerically , and has been observed in our experiments , only at intermediate temperatures . at low temperatures",

    "in this paper we discuss new experiments on the influence of thermal noise on current - voltage curves and the switching current of small area intrinsic josephson junctions .",
    "two main effects of thermal fluctuations : premature switching and phase - diffusion , are observed .",
