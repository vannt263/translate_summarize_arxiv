    "frequency ( rf ) sensor networks are wireless networks that monitor the changes in the received signal strength ( rss ) of the links in order to localize and track people , without requiring them to carry or wear any radio device . in these systems ,",
    "the rss measurements can be processed to form images of the changes in the propagation field of the monitored area in presence of moving people and objects - a process named radio tomographic imaging ( rti ) @xcite . unlike previous works @xcite which have focused on single target localization and tracking",
    ", this work aims at contributing to the growing field of device - free localization ( dfl ) through rf sensor networks @xcite by presenting a system capable of accurately tracking in real - time multiple people ( or _ targets _ ) moving in real - world indoor environments where low - power transceivers are deployed .",
    "the potential applications of rf sensor networks are many , including smart buildings and perimeter surveillance , ambient assisted living and residential monitoring @xcite , breathing detection @xcite , and security and rescue operations . compared to other sensing technologies applied in indoor dfl , such as infrared , ultrasonic range finders @xcite , ultra - wideband ( uwb ) radios and video cameras , rf sensor networks provide several advantages : they work in the dark and",
    "can penetrate smoke and walls ; they are less invasive in domestic environments than video camera networks ; they are significantly less expensive than uwb transceivers ; their installation and maintenance time is minimal .",
    "people moving in an area where wireless transceivers are deployed affect the propagation of the radio signals by shadowing , reflecting , diffracting or scattering a subset of their multipath components @xcite .",
    "in open and uncluttered environments , where line - of - sight ( los ) communication among the transceivers is predominant , a person obstructing a link line will generally cause attenuation of the radio signal .",
    "this phenomenon has been succesfully applied for dfl in several works @xcite . however , in cluttered environments , where multipath propagation is predominant , the change in rss due to the presence of a human body becomes more unpredictable .",
    "as the link line is obstructed , the rss can also remain constant or increase @xcite .",
    "in addition , due to the multipath propagation of the radio signals , people can affect the rss also when located far away from the link line @xcite .",
    "most of the research presented so far in the area of dfl with rf sensor networks has considered the situation in which only one target had to be located and tracked @xcite .",
    "however , the real - world scenarios in which these systems are to be used often require the localization and tracking of multiple targets .",
    "moreover , the dfl system should be able _ a ) _ to perform the localization and tracking tasks in real - time even when the targets trajectories intersect , and _",
    "b ) _ to correctly estimate the number or targets to be tracked as people enter and exit the monitored area . in this work",
    ", we tackle all of these challenges . in forming the rti images",
    ", we apply a novel approach that weights the rss measurements based on the fade level @xcite of the frequency channels on which the rss was measured .",
    "we adapt machine vision methods to rti and use the new methods to process the rti images in real - time to detect and track the blobs corresponding to real targets .",
    "multiple target tracking with rf sensor networks is made more challenging in that in rti the targets have to be modeled as points , consisting only of position , velocity and acceleration , neither having physical length or other features such as shape , color , or size .",
    "although the blob size and shape in rti are loosely related to a person s size , the blob dramatically changes depending on a person s position in the monitored area and on the positions of other people in the area .",
    "thus , the noise in the blob shape overwhelms any attempt to determine a person s features .",
    "we invite the reader to view an rti video at @xcite as an example of the capabilities and limitations of the imaging modality .",
    "in addition , due to measurement noise and the simultaneous presence of multiple targets , objects and obstructions in the monitored area , spurious blobs ( not corresponding to real targets ) can appear in the image .",
    "for the same reasons , blobs corresponding to real targets can temporarily disappear from the image .",
    "these factors increase the difficulty of multiple target tracking , especially with intersecting trajectories .",
    "we evalute the performance of the multi - target tracking system in three different indoor environments , _ i.e. _ an open environment with no obstructions nor objects , a one - bedroom apartment with internal walls , furniture and various objects , and a heavily cluttered office environment .",
    "the few multi - target tracking methods developed for rss - based dfl are either non - real time @xcite , track only two or three people @xcite , assume that the number of targets is fixed and known a priori @xcite , or do not attempt to track targets with intersecting trajectories @xcite .",
    "in an experimental test with four targets having separated trajectories , the method in @xcite achieves as low as @xmath3 m average accuracy , consuming @xmath4 seconds to process an rti image .",
    "our method achieves @xmath2 m average accuracy in an experimental test with four targets having intersecting trajectories , consuming @xmath5 milliseconds to process an rti image . to the best of our knowledge , we are the first to demonstrate that rf sensor networks can be used in real - world indoor environments to accurately track in real - time up to four targets even when their trajectories intersect multiple times .",
    "the highest average tracking error measured in the tests is @xmath0 m with two targets , @xmath1 m with three targets , and @xmath2 m with four targets .",
    "videos showing the performance of the multi - target tracking system during the tests described in this paper can be found at @xcite .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we present the methods used to form radio tomographic images and to track multiple targets in section [ sec : multichannel_rti ] and [ sec : mtt ] , respectively .",
    "the experiments carried out are described in section [ sec : experimental_setup ] , and the results are listed and discussed in section [ sec : tests_results ] .",
    "the related work is described in section [ sec : related_work ] .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section [ sec : paper_conclusion ] .",
    "in this section , we describe how the rss measurements collected on multiple channels are processed in real - time to form radio tomographic images .",
    "we deploy @xmath6 sensors at positions @xmath7 . at time",
    "instant @xmath8 , we measure the rss @xmath9 in dbm of link @xmath10 on channel @xmath11 .",
    "our objective is to estimate the change in the propagation field of the monitored area , @xmath12 , from the rss measurements collected on all the links of the network .      in obstructed environments ,",
    "radio signals propagate from the transmitter to the receiver via multiple paths . at the receiver , a phasor sum of the waves impinging on the antenna",
    "determine the rss .",
    "depending on the relative phase of each wave , the waves may add constructively or destructively . as",
    "a wave s phase is a function of the center frequency and path length , the rss is a function of the center frequency and position of the communicating devices , an effect called multipath fading .",
    "the relation between steady - state , narrow - band fading and the temporal fading statistics of the rss due to human movement has been described in @xcite , where the authors define the concept of _ fade level _ , a continuum between two extremes : _ deep fade _ and _ anti - fade_. for a link in a deep fade , when the link line is obstructed , the rss , on average , increases .",
    "in addition , deep fade links show changes of the rss even when the person is at some positions far away from the link line . on the contrary , for a link in an anti - fade , when the link line is obstructed , the rss , on average , decreases .",
    "moreover , anti - fade links show changes of the rss only when the person is in the close proximity of the link line . due to the limited size and predictable shape of their sensitivity area ,",
    "the anti - fade links are the most informative for dfl . in @xcite ,",
    "the channels used to form rti images were sorted based on their fade level , and the rss measurements of most anti - fade channels of each link were selected . in this work ,",
    "we use channel diversity and propose a novel approach to consider the rss measurements of all the channels and weight them based on their fade level .    during an initial calibration period performed in static conditions , _",
    "i.e. _ , when the monitored area is empty , we measure the average rss of each link @xmath10 on each different frequency channel @xmath13 , @xmath14 , which can be modeled as : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the actual transmit power , in dbm , on channel @xmath13 and @xmath17 is the path gain , in dbm , of link @xmath10 on channel @xmath13 . for the wireless sensors used in the experiments ( see section [ sec : hardware ] ) ,",
    "the actual transmit power @xmath16 is different from the nominal one and , most importantly for estimating the fade level , is a function of the frequency channel @xmath13 , in part due to the difficulty in antenna impedance matching across a wide frequency band @xcite .",
    "the fade level of channel @xmath13 for link @xmath10 is estimated as the difference between the path gain measured for channel @xmath13 and the minimum of the path gains measured for the used frequency channels : @xmath18 thus , for the same link @xmath10 , channel @xmath19 is in a deeper fade than channel @xmath20 if @xmath21 .",
    "note that @xmath22 , and that @xmath23 for one channel @xmath13 on each link .",
    "the rss measurements collected on different channels are weighted based on the fade level defined in ( [ e : fade_level ] ) , bearing in mind that anti - fade channels provide measurements more informative for localization . the weighted average change in rss of link @xmath10 at time @xmath8 is computed as : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the difference between the rss of link @xmath10 on channel @xmath13 measured at time @xmath8 , @xmath26 , and the reference rss , @xmath14 .      the change in rss is assumed to be a spatial integral of the propagation field of the monitored area .",
    "when the propagation field is discretized , some voxels affect the rss of a specific link , whereas others do not .",
    "thus , the change in rss of each link is assumed to be a linear combination of the change caused by each voxel : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the change in rss caused by voxel @xmath29 , @xmath30 the weight of voxel @xmath29 for link @xmath10 , @xmath31 the number of voxels in the discretized image and @xmath32 the noise of link @xmath10 .",
    "the weight @xmath33 indicates how each voxel of the image affects each link .",
    "for this , we use an ellipse model @xcite in which the transmitter and receiver are located at the foci of the ellipse . according to this model",
    ", a voxel @xmath29 at position @xmath34 that is located within the ellipse of link @xmath10 has its weight @xmath30 set to a constant , which is inversely proportional to the area of the ellipse .",
    "otherwise its weight is set to zero , as follows : @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 is the area of the ellipse , and @xmath40 is its excess path length , _",
    "i.e. _ , the parameter defining the width of the ellipse .",
    "when all the links of the wireless network are considered , the change in the propagation field of the monitored area is : @xmath41 in which @xmath42 and @xmath43 are @xmath44 vectors representing the weighted rss change and noise of the @xmath45 wireless links , and @xmath12 is the @xmath46 change in the propagation field to be estimated , where each element @xmath47 represents change due to the presence of a person in voxel @xmath29 . the linear model for the change in the propagation field",
    "is based on the correlated shadowing models in @xcite and on the work in @xcite .    since estimating the image vector @xmath12 from the links measurements @xmath42 is an ill - posed inverse problem ,",
    "regularization is required . in this work ,",
    "we use a regularized least - squares approach @xcite : @xmath48 where : @xmath49 in which @xmath50 is the regularization parameter .",
    "the _ a priori _ covariance matrix @xmath51 is calculated by using an exponential spatial decay : @xmath52_{ji}=\\sigma_{x}^{2}e^{-\\| \\mathbf{v}_{j}-\\mathbf{v}_{i } \\| /\\delta_{c}},\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is the variance of voxel measurements , and @xmath54 is the voxels correlation distance .",
    "the linear transformation @xmath55 is computed only once before real - time operation .",
    "the calculation of @xmath56 in ( [ e : linear_transformation ] ) requires @xmath57 operations and can be performed in real - time .      an rti image representing the situation in which @xmath58 targets are located in different regions of the monitored area",
    "should ideally show @xmath58 _ blobs _ , _ i.e. _ , regions in which the voxels have an intensity much higher than the intensity of the surrounding voxels .",
    "however , due to noise in the rss measurements and the simultaneous presence of multiple individuals and obstructions , the rti images are often noisy , showing multiple spurious blobs of small size which do not correspond to actual targets . for this reasons ,",
    "a gaussian filter is applied on the rti image .",
    "this operation has the effect of reducing the image s high spatial frequency components , filtering out small spurious blobs while simultaneously keeping those larger blobs corresponding to actual targets @xcite .",
    "the filtering is obtained by convolving the rti image with an isotropic gaussian kernel : @xmath59 where @xmath60 m is the standard deviation of the gaussian kernel which indicates how much the image is filtered ( or _ blurred _ ) .",
    "since the estimated rti image @xmath56 is stored as a set of discrete voxels , we need to produce a discrete approximation of the gaussian kernel @xmath61 to be able to perform the convolution .",
    "thus , the kernel is truncated after @xmath62 voxels , where @xmath63 m is the radius of the kernel .",
    "the low - pass filtered rti image @xmath64 is then calculated as : @xmath65 where @xmath66 represents the convolution operator . as a result ,",
    "each voxel of the filtered rti image is a weighted average of the voxel s neighborhood , with the central pixels weighted more than the peripheral ones .",
    "the values of @xmath67 and @xmath68 are chosen so as to fit the size of the blobs corresponding to the targets .",
    "the methods described in the previous section form radio tomographic images in real - time , _",
    "i.e. _ , pictures of the change in the propagation field of the monitored area caused by the presence and movements of the people found in it .",
    "these images can be considered as _",
    "frames _ of a video showing the movements of multiple targets . in this section ,",
    "we describe the methods used to process the rti images and track multiple targets in real - time .",
    "our objective is to correctly detect the entrance and exit of the targets and estimate their position @xmath69 by assigning to each of them a voxel of the estimated rti image .",
    "after denoising the image , an additional filter is required in order to reduce the size of the set of voxels that go through the clustering process ( see section [ sec : clustering ] ) and to preserve only those in the regions occupied by the targets . to this purpose , a dynamic threshold @xmath70 is set as follows .    during the calibration period , _",
    "i.e. _ , when the monitored area is empty , we calculate the average maximum intensity of the formed rti images , @xmath71 .",
    "when the monitored area is empty , the threshold @xmath70 is set to @xmath72 to filter the voxels having very low intensity . on the other hand ,",
    "when targets are being tracked , we derive the minimum intensity , @xmath73 , of the targets @xmath74 in the set of estimated targets @xmath75 as : @xmath76_{t}}\\ ] ] we then low - pass filter @xmath73 : @xmath77 where @xmath78 .",

    "the pda and jpda approaches assume that the number of targets is known and constant . moreover , the pf and mht approaches are methods that struggle to meet strict real - time requirements : the pf needs a high number of particles to obtain accurate tracking , at the expense of a high computational complexity and long processing time @xcite .",
    "moreover , whenever the number of targets to be tracked increases , the pf needs a higher number of particles to maintain the same accuracy , making the processing time even longer . in mht , each feasible target - observation association is considered as an hypothesis with a specific probability . at each new rti image ,",
