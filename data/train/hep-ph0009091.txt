    "<S> determination of all the mixing parameters , in particular the cp violating kobayashi - maskawa phase @xcite , is one of the most challenging goals in particle physics .    in this talk </S>",
    "<S> , we consider the possibility of measuring the effect of leptonic cp violation ( or equivalently t violation ) in neutrino oscillation  @xcite experiments within the standard three neutrino flavor framework . </S>",
    "<S> we will end up with the proposal of medium baseline experiments with much lower energy ( @xmath0 mev ) neutrino beam than the ones usually considered ( typically @xmath2 gev ) in accelerator experiments .    </S>",
    "<S> let us consider the neutrino mass squared differences suggested by the atmospheric neutrino observation @xcite and the msw solutions @xcite to the solar neutrino problem . in the standard three - flavor neutrino mixing scheme , </S>",
    "<S> all the independent mass squared differences are exhausted if we assume the oscillation interpretations of the atmospheric as well as solar neutrino data . </S>",
    "<S> they are , from the atmospheric neutrinos @xmath3 and from the solar neutrino data , @xmath4 or @xmath5 where sma , lma , and low denote the small mixing angle , large mixing angle and the low @xmath6 msw solutions , respectively @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we use the notation @xmath7 in this report .    </S>",
    "<S> many authors including us examined the question of how to separate the genuine cp violating effect due to the leptonic kobayashi - maskawa phase from the fake one induced by matter effect @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we take a simple alternative strategy to look for a region of parameters in which the matter effect is `` ignorable '' in the first approximation . </S>",
    "<S> let us define the flavor mixing matrix @xmath8 as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 stand for the gauge and the mass eigenstates , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we take for convenience the representation of @xmath8 as @xmath12 where @xmath13 are su(3 ) gell - mann s matrix and @xmath14 with @xmath15 being the cp violating phase .    </S>",
    "<S> let us first neglect the possible matter effect and consider the cp violating effect in vacuum . under the mass difference hierarchy @xmath16 which is implied by the solar and atmospheric neutrino data , the neutrino oscillation probability in vacuum can be written as @xmath17 \\sin^2 \\left(\\frac{\\delta_{12}l}{2}\\right)\\nonumber\\\\   & & \\hskip -2 cm   - 2j \\sin ( \\delta_{12}l )   [ 1 - \\cos(\\delta_{13}l ) ] \\nonumber\\\\   & & \\hskip -2.cm   + 4j \\sin ( \\delta_{13}l ) \\sin^2 ( \\delta_{12}l ) ,   \\label{probvac}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the distance traveled by neutrinos . here </S>",
    "<S> the effect of cp violation comes in through @xmath20 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ probvac ] ) which is defined as @xmath21\\ ] ] as it is the unique ( in three - flavor mixing scheme ) measure for cp violation as first observed by jarlskog @xcite in the case of quark mixing . with our parametrization of mixing matrix </S>",
    "<S> , it takes the form @xmath22 , where the sign is positive for @xmath23 and ( 1 , 2 ) and @xmath24 corresponds to their ( anti- ) cyclic permutations of @xmath25 and @xmath26 .    </S>",
    "<S> we first note that from the expression of @xmath20 , if any one of the mixing angles is extremely small or very close to @xmath27 there is little hope in detecting the cp violation even if @xmath15 is large . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason , we will not deal with the case of sma msw solar neutrino solution .    </S>",
    "<S> we also notice that the effect of cp violation is larger if the quantity @xmath28 is larger . from this </S>",
    "<S> we see that larger values of @xmath29 , lower @xmath30 and larger @xmath19 is preferrable . for this reason we consider largest plausible value of @xmath29 coming from lma msw solution ( which is chosen among the suggested solutions ) to the solar neutrino problem and lowest possibly practical energy @xmath31 100 mev which can be provided by accelerator experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we note that larger distance @xmath19 is preferrable just in terms of the probability but it has to be determined such that the observables of the cp violating effect which is proportional to the expected number of events ( not the probability itself ) is significant . </S>",
    "<S> ( see our results below ) .    </S>",
    "<S> next let us consider the matter effect . </S>",
    "<S> we first note that at neutrino energy of @xmath31 100 mev there is a hierarchy among the relevant energy scales ; @xmath32 where we assume @xmath33 and @xmath34 ev@xmath35 @xmath36 assuming lma msw solution  @xcite and @xmath37 ev@xmath35 @xmath38 assuming @xmath39 atmospheric neutrino oscillation solution .    </S>",
    "<S> thanks to the mass hierarchy ( [ hierarchy ] ) we can formulate the perturbation theory and it is straightforward to compute the neutrino oscillation probabilities @xmath40 as well as @xmath41 under the adiabatic approximation  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the appearance probability @xmath40 reads @xmath42\\nonumber\\\\ & &   \\hskip -2.5 cm \\times \\sin^2 \\left[\\frac{1}{2 } \\xi \\delta_{12}l \\right ]   - 2j_m ( \\theta_{12}^m , \\delta)\\sin \\left [ \\xi\\delta_{12}l \\right ] , \\label{probnu}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 is the matter enhanced jarlskog factor , @xmath46 , and we have averaged the rapidly oscillating piece driven by @xmath47 in the cp violating term . the antineutrino transition probability @xmath41 is given by the same expressions as above but replacing @xmath48 and @xmath15 by @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> let us note that if @xmath51 1,000 km or so , the approximation @xmath52 is valid and the expressions of the oscillation probabilities approximately reduce to those in the vacuum because @xmath53    using the mixing parameters described in the caption of fig . 1 , we verify by our numerical computations that the matter effect in fact cancels out . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] we plot the oscillation probabilities for neutrino and anti - neutrino , and their difference , @xmath54 , as a function of distance from the source with the neutrino energy @xmath55 mev , for both @xmath56 and @xmath57 , where it corresponds to the resonance energy in the neutrino channel . </S>",
    "<S> although we sit on at the resonance energy of neutrino channel the features in the resonant neutrino flavor conversion can not be traced in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] , but rather we observe the one very much similar to the vacuum oscillation even for @xmath19 as large as 1000 km .    0.3 cm    </S>",
    "<S> -0.5 cm    -0.5 cm    now we discuss the possible experiments which utilize the imitating vacuum mechanism to measure leptonic cp violation . </S>",
    "<S> measurement of cp violation at a few @xmath58 ( or smaller ) level at neutrino oscillation experiments at @xmath59 mev leaves practically the unique channel @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally , what is relevant is the the number of events not the oscillation probability itself . here , as a measure of cp violation </S>",
    "<S> , we consider the ratio of the expected number of events due to @xmath56 and @xmath57 reactions .    </S>",
    "<S> in such low energy appearance experiment we have the following difficulties ; ( 1 ) smaller cross sections ( 2 ) lower flux due to larger beam opening angle , @xmath60 ( e/100 mev)@xmath61 radian . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we are invited to the idea of the baseline as short as possible , because the luminosity decreases as @xmath62 as baseline length grows . however , from fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 we see that longer the baseline , the larger the cp violating effect and it is expected that there exist some optimal distance which gives the signal most ( statistically ) significant .    </S>",
    "<S> detection of low - energy neutrinos at better than a few @xmath58 level accuracy requires supermassive detectors . </S>",
    "<S> probably the best thinkable detection apparatus is the water cherenkov detector of superkamiokande type . </S>",
    "<S> let us estimate the expected number of events at a megaton detector placed at @xmath63 km . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the neutrino beam flux 10 times as intense as ( despite the difference in energy ) that of the design luminosity in k2k experiment @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we note that in the future it is expected that even an 100 times more intense proton flux than kek - ps seems possible at japan hadron facility @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the dominant @xmath64-induced reaction in water at around @xmath65 mev is not the familiar @xmath66 elastic scattering but the reaction on @xmath67 , @xmath68 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the cross section of the former reaction is about @xmath69 , while the latter is @xmath70 at @xmath65 mev @xcite , which is a factor of 1000 times larger . </S>",
    "<S> however , since the number of oxygen in water is 1/10 of the number of electrons , net the number of events due to the reaction @xmath71 is larger than that of @xmath72 elastic scattering by a factor of 100 . </S>",
    "<S> the neutrino flux at the detector located at @xmath73 km is , by our assumption , 10 times more intense than the neutrino flux at superkamiokande in k2k experiment . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is , roughly speaking , @xmath74 @xmath75 where pot stands for proton on target . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the expected number of events @xmath76 assuming 100 @xmath58 conversion of @xmath77 to @xmath64 is given by @xmath78    in the antineutrino channel , the dominant reaction is @xmath79 with cross section @xmath80 at @xmath65 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the event number due to this reaction , assuming the same flux of @xmath81 as @xmath77 , is similar to that of ( [ eventno ] ) because the cross section is about half but there are two free protons per one oxygen . </S>",
    "<S> there is additional oxygen reaction @xmath82 with approximately factor 3 smaller cross section than that of @xmath83 @xcite .    in order to estimate the optimal distance </S>",
    "<S> , we compute the expected number of events in neutrino and anti - neutrino channels as well as their ratios as a function of distance taking into account of neutrino beam energy spread . for definiteness </S>",
    "<S> , we assume that the average energy of neutrino beam @xmath84 = 100 mev and beam energy spread of gaussian type with width @xmath85 mev . </S>",
    "<S> we present our results in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] .    0.8 cm    -0.2 </S>",
    "<S> cm    -0.6 cm    we see from this plot that taking the error ( only statistical one for simplicity ) into account , @xmath19 must not be too short or too long and there exist on optimal distance which is rather short , @xmath86 km , much shorter than that of the current ( or future ) long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) . at such distance </S>",
    "<S> the significance of the cp violating signal is as large as 3 - 4 @xmath87 .    </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the experiment is quite feasible under such intense neutrino beam and a megaton detector . </S>",
    "<S> fortunately , the possibility of constructing a megaton water cherenkov detector is already discussed by the experimentalists @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> some final remarks are in order .    </S>",
    "<S> 0.1 cm 1 ) for the other msw solutions such as sma or low to the solar neutrino problem , due to the much smaller mixing angle and/or @xmath6 , with the same experimental conditions , the expected number of events is smaller than at least a factor of 100 and therefore , the experiment does not appear feasible with the same apparatus .    0.1 cm 2 ) an alternative way of measuring cp violation is the multiple detector method @xcite which may be inevitable if either one of @xmath88 or @xmath89 beam is difficult to prepare . </S>",
    "<S> it utilizes the fact that the first , the second , and the third terms in the oscillation probability ( [ probnu ] ) have different @xmath19 dependences , @xmath90-independent ( after averaging over energy spread of the neutrino beam ) , @xmath91 , and @xmath90 , respectively , in the linear approximation .    </S>",
    "<S> 0.1 cm 3 ) intense neutrino beams from muon storage ring at low energies , proposed as prism , phase - rotation intense secondary mesons @xcite , could be an ideal source for neutrinos for the experiment discussed in this report . </S>",
    "<S> of course , it requires identification of @xmath92 from @xmath64 by some methods , e.g. , by adding chlorine ( @xmath93cl ) into the water cherenkov detector to make it sensitive to the characteristic @xmath94 mev @xmath95 rays arising from the absorption of neutron into the chlorine followed by @xmath79 reaction .    0.1 cm 4 ) we would like to urge experimentalists to think more about the better supermassive detection apparatus than water cherenkov for highly efficient and accurate measurement of low energy neutrinos .    </S>",
