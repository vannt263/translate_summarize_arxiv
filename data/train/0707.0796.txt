    "wireless sensor networks are often used for applications like environmental and traffic control , habitat monitoring , or weather forecasts  @xcite , which require to sample a physical phenomenon over an area of interest ( the sensor field ) . in this paper",
    ", we consider a set of sensors communicating with a sink node , through either single- or multi - hop communications .",
    "each sensor locally samples the physical field , while the sink collecting all samples is in charge of reconstructing the signal of interest .",
    "we assume that initially sensors are either located at pre - defined positions , or , if randomly deployed over the network area , their location can be estimated at the sink node ( see  @xcite for a description of node location methods in sensor networks ) .",
    "we do not deal with spatio - temporal correlation , but consider a fixed time instant and focus on the spatial sampling and reconstruction of the sensor field .",
    "we note that , in general , sensors provide an irregular sampling of the observed phenomenon",
    ". this may be due to various reasons : random deployment of the nodes , environment characteristics that bias the network deployment , sensors entering a sleep mode , inaccuracy in sensor positioning , or nodes movement  @xcite .",
    "in all these cases the sink has to reconstruct the field from a collection of samples that are _ irregularly _ spaced , different from the classical equally ( or _ regularly _ ) spaced sampling .",
    "the problem of signal reconstruction from irregular samples has been widely addressed in signal processing , where several efficient and fast algorithms have been proposed to numerically reconstruct or approximate a signal @xcite .",
    "the problem we address in this work , however , is different ; the questions we pose are :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ( i ) how do noisy measures and inaccurate knowledge of the sensor positions affect the quality of the reconstructed signal ? _ + _ ( ii ) how can we trade off system parameters like measurement noise , field bandwidth , signal reconstruction quality and number of sensors ? _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    to answer these questions we analyze two different models of the monitoring system that account for the quality of the measurements performed by the sensors and differ in the accuracy with which the sensor positions are known at the sink node .",
    "more specifically , the model denoted as * model a * refers to the case where sensors are fixed , the sink has perfect knowledge of the sensor positions , but the sensor measurements are affected by error . in the second model , named * model b * , besides noisy measurements , we consider that the sensors position varies around an average value , and only the average location of the nodes is known at the sink .",
    "examples where this model applies are observation systems using surface buoys  @xcite , underwater robots located at different depths  @xcite , dropsondes or low - cost unmanned platforms , as in @xcite .    for each of these models , we use as field reconstruction techniques some linear filters that are commonly employed in signal detection and estimation , and we evaluate the mean square error of the resulting estimate .    we find that a key parameter for the network performance is the ratio @xmath0 of the field number of harmonics to the number of sampling sensors . in particular , there exists a value of this ratio , beyond which the performance of all considered reconstruction strategies degrade significantly , even for low values of noise level and limited uncertainty on the sensor positions . to obtain an acceptable reconstruction quality",
    "when @xmath0 is large ( i.e. , the number of available sensors is limited compared to the field bandwidth ) , reconstruction techniques that exploit some knowledge of the measurement noise and of the jitter in the sensors position must be employed .",
    "we also carry out an asymptotic analysis of the system as the field number of harmonics and the number of sensors grow to infinity , while their ratio @xmath0 is kept constant , and we show that this is an effective tool to study the system performance , even when the number of sensors is small . finally , we find a lower bound to the mean square error that can be achieved by any of the considered techniques , both under model a and model b.    the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section",

    "finally , in sections [ sec : summary ] and [ sec : conclusions ] we summarize our main results and draw some conclusions .",
    "let us consider a one - dimensional bandlimited field @xmath1 represented by @xmath2 harmonics as @xmath3 the field is observed within one period interval @xmath4 and sampled by @xmath5 sensors placed at positions entry of the matrix @xmath6 is denoted by @xmath7 .",

    "the signal samples are denoted by the column vector @xmath15^{\\rm t}$ ] .",
    "the field discrete spectrum is given by the @xmath2 complex vector @xmath16^t$ ] .",
    "the complex numbers @xmath17 represent amplitudes and phases of the harmonics in @xmath1 .",
    "we can think of @xmath18 as the approximate one - sided bandwidth of the field .",
    "we assume that the entries of @xmath19 are i.i.d .",
    "uniformly distributed random variables in @xmath4 .",
    "the extension to a multi - dimensional field can be easily obtained , as discussed later in this section .",
    "we define @xmath0 as the ratio of the number of harmonics which describe the field to the number of sensors , i.e. , @xmath20 .",
    "this is an important parameter in our analysis .",
    "note that the number of sensors @xmath5 also corresponds to the sampling rate ; thus , the number @xmath0 is the ratio of twice the field bandwidth to the sampling rate ( frequency ) . in particular , in regular sampling theory , exact reconstruction is achieved for @xmath21 and , if a nyquist regular sampling interval were used , we would have : @xmath22 .",
    "we consider @xmath18 to be known , and the random vector @xmath23 to have zero mean and covariance matrix @xmath24=\\sigma^2_a{{\\bf i}}_{2m+1}$ ] , where @xmath25 corresponds to the field average power spectral density .    the value @xmath26 of the field at positions @xmath19 depends on the spectrum @xmath23 through the expression @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the @xmath29 _ generalized fourier matrix _ defined as : @xmath30 the dependence of the matrix @xmath28 on the position vector @xmath19 is clearly indicated by its subscript .",
    "when the samples are equally spaced in the interval @xmath4 , the matrix @xmath31 is a unitary matrix ( i.e. , @xmath32 ) .",
    "the above system model refers to a uni - dimensional field where sensor positions are determined by a scalar variable .",
    "however , the extension to the multi - dimensional case can still be easily obtained since the relation between field spectrum and samples in a band - limited multi - dimensional field can be expressed in a matrix form similar to ( [ eq : s ] ) , where only the structure of the matrix @xmath28 differs .",
    "finally , we assume that sensor field measures are sent to a processing unit , the so - called _ sink _ node , whose task is to provide an estimate of the sensed field .",
    "since we focus on the reconstruction of the physical field , we consider that sensor transmissions always reach successfully the sink node ] .    by relying on the assumptions discussed above , we study the following two systems .    * * model a : fixed sensors , perfect knowledge of the sensor positions , noisy measures * + in this model , sensors have a fixed position , given by the vector @xmath19 and known at the sink node , but each sensor provides a measure of the field affected by additive noise with zero mean and variance @xmath33  @xcite .",
    "the additive noise approximates the errors affecting the measurement procedure  @xcite .",
    "+ the measures vector can therefore be written as : @xmath34 where @xmath26 is the true field and the zero mean noise vector is denoted by @xmath35 , with covariance matrix @xmath36=\\sigma^2_n{{\\bf i}}_r$ ] . *",
    "* model b : sensors with jittered positions and noisy measures * + in this case each sensor moves around an average position @xmath37 ( @xmath14 ) , i.e. , the sensor positions are given by : @xmath38 , where : @xmath39=\\xvh$ ] and @xmath40 is the displacement of the sensors with respect to their average location @xmath41 .",
    "note that our problem differs from the well known problem of jittered sampling ( see e.g. , @xcite ) , since we deal with irregular sample locations .",
    "the displacements @xmath42 , @xmath14 , are modeled as independent zero mean gaussian random variables with variance @xmath43 and @xmath44 = \\sigma^2_\\delta\\,{{\\bf i}}_r$ ] . for convenience and neglecting the edge effects",
    ", we consider @xmath45 so that @xmath46 falls in the observation interval @xmath4 .",
    "the vector @xmath47 of measures is still given again by  ( [ eq : p_fixed ] ) .",
    "also , noise , displacement , and field spectrum are assumed to be uncorrelated , hence @xmath48 = { \\mathop{\\mathbb{e}}\\limits}[{{\\bf n}}{{\\bf a}}{^\\dagger}]= { \\mathop{\\mathbb{e}}\\limits}[{{\\bf a}}{\\boldsymbol{\\delta}}{^\\dagger } ] = { { \\bf 0}}$ ] , and the sink has perfect knowledge of @xmath41 .",
    "given a network where sensors can enter a low - power operational state ( i.e. , a sleep mode ) , the work in @xcite presents an algorithm to determine which sensor subsets should be selected to acquire data from an area of interest and which nodes should remain inactive to save energy . a similar problem is addressed in @xcite , where an adaptive sampling is described , which allows the central data - collector to vary the number of active sensors , i.e. , samples , according to the desired resolution level . the optimal sensor density that minimizes the network energy consumption , subject to constraints on the quality of the reconstructed signal and network lifetime ,",
    "is studied in @xcite .",
    "note that in our work we consider an irregular topology , which may be caused by nodes moving into a sleep state ; however we do not directly address energy efficiency or scheduling of the node sleep / activity periods .    in @xcite ,",
    "the authors consider a uni - dimensional field , uniformly sampled at the nyquist frequency by low - precision sensors . the impact on the field reconstruction accuracy of quantization errors and node density is evaluated .",
    "the effect of random error sources affecting the adc , besides quantization , is investigated in @xcite . in our work",
    "we consider an additive noise that models errors due to the measurement procedure as well as errors due to the adc , but we do not specifically focus on the latter issue .    the impact of medium access control ( mac ) protocols on the reconstruction of a signal field is investigated in @xcite .",
    "both deterministic and random mac schemes are considered , and performance are derived as the number of received packets and the experienced snr vary .",
    "related to our work is also the literature on spectral analysis  @xcite , which deals with the problem of recovering the amplitude of sine waves immersed in noise .",
    "note , however , that techniques such as music do not estimate phases ; thus , we do not compare with such techniques since our linear filtering reconstruction yields the estimate of both amplitudes and phases .",
    "the field reconstruction at the sink node with spatial and temporal correlation among sensor measures is studied in @xcite . in particular , in  @xcite",
    "the observed field is a discrete vector of target positions and sensor observations are dependent . by modeling the sensor network as a channel encoder and exploiting some concepts from coding theory ,",
    "the network capacity , defined as the maximum ratio of target positions to number of sensors , is studied as a function of noise , sensing function and sensor connections .",
    "the paper by dong and tong  @xcite focuses on signal reconstruction from possibly random samples , as we do .",
    "however , two major issues make our work significantly different from  @xcite .",
    "dong and tong indeed assume that the exact sensors locations are known and that the central controller always receives a sufficiently large number of samples .",
    "these assumptions allow an interpolation method , which is used in dong and tong s work , to provide good performances . in our case , instead , even in the asymptotic analysis",
    ", the ratio of the number of harmonics to the number of samples is kept constant and , hence , interpolation may be highly inefficient as we will show in the following .",
    "the problem of reconstructing a band - limited signal from an irregular set of samples at unknown locations is addressed in  @xcite . there",
    "the signal is oversampled by irregularly spaced sensors ; sensor positions are unknown but always equal to an integer multiple of the sampling interval .",
    "different solution methods are proposed , and the conditions for which there exist multiple solutions or a unique solution are discussed . differently from  @xcite , we assume that the sink can either acquire or estimate the sensor locations and that sensors are randomly deployed over a finite interval .    finally , in our previous work @xcite some conditions on the irregular topology of the sensor network are identified , which allow for a successful signal reconstruction , both under deterministic and random node deployment . in particular , in @xcite the spectrum estimate @xmath49 , computed by the sink , is obtained by applying to @xmath26 the moore - penrose pseudo - inverse of the matrix @xmath28 , i.e. , @xmath50 .",
    "the system model adopted in @xcite is ideal in the sense that the reconstruction algorithm has perfect knowledge of the vector @xmath19 and neglects noisy measures : the failure in reconstruction ( i.e. @xmath51 ) is only due to the bad conditioning of the matrix @xmath52 in relation to the finite machine precision .",
    "in this work , instead , we propose to apply linear filters to the field reconstruction and consider the following causes of quality degradation : _ ( i ) _ noisy measures , and _",
    "( ii ) _ uncertainty at the sink on the sensors position .",
    "here we describe the techniques we use for field reconstruction , and define the performance metrics employed for assessing the effectiveness of these techniques on the quality of the reconstructed field . finally , we provide some mathematical tools necessary for the analysis of the models under study .",
    "several reconstruction techniques have been proposed in the literature , which amount to the solution of a linear system ( see @xcite and the references cited therein ) .",
    "a widely used technique consists in processing the measures @xmath47 by means of a linear filter , @xmath53 , which is an @xmath54 matrix and is a function of the system parameters known at the sink . in this case , the estimate of the field spectrum is given by : @xmath55 the system model in  ( [ eq : p_fixed ] ) is similar the one employed in multiuser communications  @xcite or multiple antennas communications @xcite . in those cases @xmath47 is the received signal , the matrix @xmath28 plays the role of spreading matrix or channel matrix , @xmath23 is the transmitted signal and @xmath35 is the channel noise . by relying on the results obtained in those fields , for each system model we propose and compare some reconstruction techniques characterized by different matrices",
    "@xmath53 : the _ matched filter ( mf ) _ , the _ zero forcing ( zf ) _ filter and some _ linear filters minimizing the mean square error _ ( lmmse )  @xcite . in the field of multiuser detection , the mf simply correlates the received signal with the desired user s time reversed spreading waveform , thus it does not take into account any other users in the system or channel dynamics .",
    "the zf filter counteracts multiuser interference but it ignores the presence of channel noise .",
    "the lmmse solution minimizes the squared error between the received and transmitted signals , thus accounting also for the channel noise ; it becomes the zero - forcing solution when no noise is present .",
    "note that the advantage of the mf with respect to the zf and lmmse filters is that no matrix inversion is needed ; while , between the zf and the lmmse filter , clearly the best performance in terms of minimum square error is given by the lmmse , however the advantage of the zf filter is that it does not require any knowledge of the noise component ( see @xcite for further details ) .      given the spectrum estimate  ( [ eq : hat_a ] ) , the field can be reconstructed as : @xmath56 as a measure of the quality of the reconstruction , we consider the _ mean square error _",

    "indeed , we have : @xmath59 therefore , in the following , for a given vector of sensor positions @xmath19 , we consider the mse defined as : @xmath60}{2m+1 } = \\frac{\\sigma^2_a}{2m+1}\\trace\\{{\\hbox{\\boldmath$\\psi$}}_{{\\bf x}}\\ } \\label{eq : mse}\\ ] ]    where @xmath61 \\label{eq : psi}\\ ] ] is a @xmath62 matrix , the operator @xmath63 $ ] averages with respect to all random variables of the model , and @xmath64 is the trace operator . also , in ( [ eq : mse ] ) we exploited the fact that , for any vector @xmath65 , we have : @xmath66= { \\mathop{\\mathbb{e}}\\limits}\\left[\\trace\\{{{\\bf v}}{{\\bf v}}{^\\dagger}\\}\\right ] = \\trace\\left\\{{\\mathop{\\mathbb{e}}\\limits}\\left[{{\\bf v}}{{\\bf v}}{^\\dagger}\\right]\\right\\}$ ] .",
    "next , we consider the vector @xmath19 to be random . in this case",
    "a more appropriate performance metric is the _ average _ mse , normalized to @xmath25 , i.e. , @xmath67}{\\sigma^2_a}\\ ] ] where mse@xmath68 is as in ( [ eq : mse ] ) and @xmath69 $ ] averages over the realizations of @xmath19 .",
