    "suppose that @xmath16 , and that @xmath3 is absolutely continuous with respect to arc length measure on @xmath1 .",
    "which sets @xmath17 have the property that @xmath18 if this is the case , we say that @xmath0 is a _ heisenberg uniqueness pair_. a dual formulation is that @xmath0 is a heisenberg uniqueness pair if and only if the functions @xmath19 span a weak - star dense subspace in @xmath20 .",
    "this concept of heisenberg uniqueness pairs has many features in common with the notion of ( weakly ) mutually annihilating pairs of borel measurable sets having positive area measure , which appears , for instance , in the book by havin and jricke @xcite .",
    "*    the properties of the fourier transform with respect to translation and multiplication by complex exponentials show that for all points @xmath21 , we have @xmath22 where hup is short for `` heisenberg uniqueness pair '' .",

    "algebraic curves @xmath1 are of particular interest , because of their connection to partial differential equations .",
    "that connection follows from the observation that for polynomials @xmath26 of two variables , @xmath27 so that if @xmath26 is real - valued and @xmath1 is the locus of the equation @xmath28 then @xmath29 identically .",
    "therefore @xmath4 solves the pde @xmath30 in the plane .",
    "in fact , the equation encodes the requirement that @xmath16 . *    * conic sections .",
    "we shall consider the case when @xmath1 is a _ conic section _",
    ", that is , the locus of a quadratic equation @xmath31 where @xmath32 are real constants .",
    "as we only consider the case when @xmath1 is a curve , this leaves us with the following cases : a straight line , two parallel straight lines , a cross , an ellipse , a parabola , or a hyperbola . *    * the line .",
    "let us look at the line first , as a model example . by the invariance properties and",
    ", we may assume that @xmath33 , the @xmath34-axis .",
    "in this case , @xmath35 depends only on @xmath36 , and it is easy to see that @xmath0 is a heisenberg uniqueness pair if and only if @xmath37 , the orthogonal projection of @xmath2 to the @xmath36-axis , is dense . *    * two parallel lines .",
    "if @xmath1 is the union of two parallel lines , we may without loss of generality assume that @xmath38 in this case , we see from the example of the line that it is necessary for @xmath0 to be a heisenberg uniqueness pair that @xmath37 be dense . but something more is needed .",
    "an absolutely continuous measure @xmath3 on @xmath1 may be written in the form @xmath39 where @xmath40 ( @xmath41 denotes the unit point mass at the point @xmath42 ) , so that @xmath43 next , we split @xmath44 where the two sets are disjoint : @xmath45 if there are two lifted points @xmath14 and @xmath46 in @xmath2 , with @xmath47 and @xmath48 , whereas @xmath49 if the latter does not happen .",
    "we quickly find that @xmath50 on the other hand , for @xmath49 , the expression @xmath51 is a well - defined function of @xmath52 , where @xmath53 stands for any of the points with @xmath54 ; we write @xmath55 for this unimodular function .",
    "if @xmath56 is a closed subset of @xmath57 and @xmath58 , we say that a function @xmath59 is _ locally the fourier transform of an @xmath60 function around @xmath61 _ provided that there exists a small open interval @xmath62 around @xmath61 and a function @xmath63 which is the fourier transform of an @xmath60 function , such that @xmath64 on @xmath65 .",
    "let @xmath66 consist of those points @xmath67 where @xmath68 is locally the fourier transform of an @xmath60 function around @xmath61 .",
    "*    @xmath0 is a heisenberg uniqueness pair if and only if @xmath69 is dense in @xmath57 .",
    "we observe that @xmath70 if @xmath71 , this is only possible if @xmath72 , so that @xmath73 a combination of and shows that @xmath74 ( so that @xmath75 ) if the set @xmath69 is dense in @xmath57 .    as for the other direction , suppose that @xmath37 is dense in @xmath57 , while @xmath69 fails to be dense in @xmath57 .",
    "we then pick a point @xmath76 such that an open interval @xmath77 around it has empty intersection with @xmath78 but then @xmath79 is dense in @xmath77 , and @xmath80 is locally the fourier transform of an @xmath60 function around @xmath61 .",
    "we thus find a function @xmath81 which coincides with @xmath80 on some open interval @xmath82 with @xmath83 , while @xmath81 is the fourier transform of an @xmath60 function .",
    "next , we pick @xmath84 with @xmath85 , such that @xmath86 , and define @xmath87 via @xmath88 , so that holds .",
    "this gives us a nontrivial measure @xmath3 with the required properties , and so @xmath0 can not be a heisenberg uniqueness pair .",
    "* the cross .",
    "if @xmath1 is a cross , the pde expresses the wave equation . by the invariance properties and",
    ", we may restrict our attention to the case when @xmath89 is the union of the two axes . here",
    ", it appears that the characterization of uniqueness pairs @xmath0 may get quite complicated .",
    "obviously , it is a necessary condition that @xmath37 and @xmath90 be dense ( @xmath90 is the orthogonal projection to the @xmath53-axis ) .",
    "this is far from sufficient , because if @xmath2 is contained in a smooth graph , we may run into trouble .",
    "for instance , if @xmath2 is contained in the diagonal @xmath91 , then we may choose @xmath92 where @xmath87 , which is supported on @xmath1 and nontrivial generically , while @xmath93 for @xmath91 .",
    "*    * the ellipse .",
    "if @xmath1 is an ellipse , the invariance of and allows us to focus on the circle @xmath94 the corresponding pde is the eigenvalue equation for the laplacian . here , the fact that @xmath1 is compact entails that @xmath35 extends to an entire function of exponential type in @xmath95 .",
    "it would seem that reasonable criteria on @xmath2 may be found that are at least close to being necessary and sufficient for @xmath0 to be a heisenberg uniqueness pair .",
    "*    * the parabola .",
    "if @xmath1 is a parabola , the invariance of and allows us to focus on the parabola @xmath96 the corresponding pde is the one - dimensional schrdinger equation without potential . here",
    ", the problem of characterizing the heisenberg uniqueness pairs @xmath0 appears quite challenging . *",
    "* the hyperbola .",
    "we shall focus most of our attention to the case when @xmath1 is a hyperbola .",
    "the corresponding pde is the one - dimensional klein - gordon equation .",
    "we will see that the situation with heisenberg uniqueness pairs is dramatically different from that of the cross . by the invariance and",
    ", we may assume that the hyperbola is given by @xmath97 *    suppose @xmath1 is the hyperbola @xmath5 and that @xmath2 is the lattice - cross @xmath6 where @xmath7 are positive reals",
    ". then @xmath0 is a heisenberg uniqueness pair if and only if @xmath8 .",
    "[ thm-1 ]    the remainder of this work is devoted to proving this assertion .",
    "but before we turn to the proof , let us consider a generalization which is more or less immediate .",
    "suppose @xmath98 is the hyperbola @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is real , and that @xmath2 is the lattice - cross @xmath6 where @xmath7 are positive reals .",

    "[ cor-1 ]    the eccentricity of the hyperbola @xmath98 is @xmath103 independently of @xmath104 .",
    "the condition of the corollary ( @xmath102 ) gets weaker as @xmath105 decreases .",
    "however , in the limit situation @xmath106  the cross  the situation changes dramatically : if @xmath2 is contained in the dual cross @xmath107 , then @xmath2 must actually be dense in the cross for @xmath108 to be a heisenberg uniqueness pair .",

    "the set @xmath114 is arguably more massive than the lattice - cross @xmath2 of corollary [ cor-1 ] . nevertheless ,",
    "if @xmath98 is as in corollary [ cor-1 ] , with @xmath104 positive , it can be shown that @xmath115 fails to be a heisenberg uniqueness pair , no matter what positive values @xmath104 and @xmath116 assume .",
    "analogously , @xmath117 also fails to be a heisenberg uniqueness pair , for all @xmath118 and @xmath113 ( but it can be shown that @xmath119 is a heisenberg uniqueness pair , however ) .",
    "this suggests that it is crucial that the points of the lattice - cross @xmath2 of corollary [ cor-1 ] are located along the characteristic directions for the klein - gordon equation ( the two axes ) .",
    "we need a result of algebraic nature .",
    "let @xmath120 be two points such that @xmath121 for some positive reals @xmath122 . then , unless @xmath123 , we have @xmath124 [ lm-1 ]    the proof is a simple exercise , and therefore omitted .",

    "this shows that the requirement that the measure @xmath3 be absolutely continuous with respect to arc length measure on @xmath1 is essential ; without it , theorem [ thm-1 ] would simply not be true .",
