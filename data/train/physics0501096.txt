    "a number of recent experiments @xcite have tested the stability of forced advancing and receding contact lines under conditions of partial wetting . for example , if a solid plate or fiber is plunging into a liquid bath to be coated ( advancing contact line ) , the speed can be quite high ( m / s ) @xcite , while maintaining a stationary contact line . in the opposite case of withdrawal ( receding contact line ) @xcite",
    ", a stationary contact line is observed only for very low speeds , and a macroscopic film is deposited @xcite typically at a speed of only a few cm / s .",
    "the description of a moving contact line is complicated by the fact that the navier - stokes equation with standard no - slip boundary conditions @xcite breaks down near it , because such a hypothetical flow would produce an infinite energy dissipation @xcite . instead",
    ", some microscopic length scale @xmath0 must be invoked that cuts off this singularity , which in this paper we are going to take as a slip length . as a result",
    ", the local flow near the contact line is characterized by a typical length of about a nanometer @xcite , which has to be matched @xcite to the macroscopic flow away from the solid . in this paper",
    ", we apply a matching method developed for spreading drops @xcite to the plunging plate , and test the result by comparing to numerical simulations .",
    "this very significantly improves the results of earlier calculations for the same problem @xcite . for the opposite case of a receding contact angle",
    "we find that a new matching procedure is needed .",
    "the results confirm our very recent criterion @xcite for the instability of a receding contact line .",

    "figure [ setup ] illustrates the geometry to be considered in the present paper . on the left",
    ", a solid plate is pushed into a pool of viscous liquid . as a result",
    ", the interface deforms and the contact line is pushed downward relative to its equilibrium position . within the present model ,",
    "this advancing contact line is stable at _ any _ speed .",
    "if the plate is withdrawn from the bath , fluid is pulled up with the plate , and a new contact line position is established . however , this state is realizable only at speeds below a critical speed @xmath4 .",
    "for @xmath5 the contact line is no longer sustainable and continues to move up the plate @xcite . in the stationary state",
    ", the plate is covered by a thin film , first described by landau , levich , and derjaguin ( lld ) @xcite . to understand the fundamental difference between pushing a plate and pulling it out",
    ", one has to consider the matching between the region very close to the contact line , and the capillary profile away from it .",
    "qualitatively , the difference in the behavior of the advancing and of the receding contact line makes sense : if the plate is pushed into the liquid , the interface is bent away from the solid , and viscous forces are reduced .",
    "if the plate is pulled , the interface is pulled toward the solid , making the film thinner and enhancing viscous effects .",
    "hence in the latter case there is a positive feedback increasing viscous forcing and thus leading to instability .    the strong energy dissipation near a moving contact line results from the fact that viscous forces become very large as the thickness of the liquid film goes to zero @xcite . as a result of the interplay between viscous and surface tension forces ,",
    "the interface is highly curved , and the contact line speed @xmath6 is properly measured by the capillary number @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the viscosity of the fluid and @xmath9 the surface tension between fluid and gas .",
    "owing to this bending the interface angle measured at , say , @xmath10 m away from the contact line differs @xcite significantly from the microscopic angle directly at the contact line .",
    "the existence of a slip length @xmath0 , which is of the order of a few molecular diameters under normal circumstances @xcite , implies a convenient separation of length scales between two different parts of the surface profile . on one hand",
    ", there is a contact line region whose typical scale is @xmath0 , on the other hand there is an `` outer '' meniscus region , whose typical length scale is set by the capillary length @xmath11 .",
    "thus one expects the local `` inner '' behavior of the profile near the contact line to be of the form @xmath12 since @xmath0 is the only available length scale .",
    "the dependence on the equilibrium contact angle @xmath13 was introduced for later convenience .",
    "firstly , one finds from ( [ scal ] ) that the curvature of the interface is @xmath14 , which becomes large for @xmath15 as expected , while the slope is @xmath16 .",
    "the inner solution ( [ scal ] ) has to be matched to an outer solution @xmath17 , whose curvature is of the order of @xmath18 , which means we have to join the two solutions at some scale @xmath19 with @xmath20 .",
    "this implies that the argument of @xmath21 can effectively be taken at @xmath22 , while @xmath23 .",
    "thus the matching condition is @xmath24 which ensures that the inner and the outer solutions are compatible .",
    "we will see that ( [ match_cond ] ) needs to be supplemented by what is essentially a condition for the slope .",
    "the matching condition ( [ match_cond ] ) is the key to understanding wetting behavior .",
    "let us summarize the main results of this paper by analyzing the solution qualitatively for the two cases of an advancing contact angle ( plate plunging into the fluid ) and of a receding contact angle ( plate being withdrawn ) .",
    "for very small @xmath0 , it is clear that @xmath25 must be small for matching to be possible , so in the limit , @xmath26 becomes the boundary condition for the inner problem .",
    "we will see that for an advancing contact angle this boundary condition yields the inner scaling function @xmath27 , first found by voinov @xcite .",
    "the matching to voinov s solution is slightly complicated by the presence of _ logarithmic _ terms in the slope @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , voinov s solution can not be applied to the case of a _ receding _ contact line .",
    "rather , all inner solutions maintain a _ finite _ curvature @xmath28 .",
    "this means that at too small a value of @xmath0 the matching condition ( [ match_cond ] ) can no longer be obeyed and the inner and the outer solutions are incompatible . as a result",
    ", the contact line vanishes . in a typical experiment ,",
    "@xmath0 is constant and the _ speed _ is increased , but the effect is the same : since the curvature of the interface is caused by viscous forces @xcite , @xmath25 increases with speed and matching becomes impossible .",
    "this explains the phenomenology described in fig.[setup ] above .",
    "the impossibility of matching a receding contact line above a critical capillary number was already noticed in @xcite , based on numerical integration of the thin - film equations .",
    "analytical solutions for the inner solution will permit us to give a much more complete description .    in the next section we will introduce the hydrodynamic equations to be used for the calculation of stationary profiles .",
    "we will confine ourselves to the `` lubrication approximation '' , valid in the limit that the liquid film is thin . in the following section we consider the case of a solid plate being pushed into the liquid ( advancing contact angle ) . by matching an inner to an outer solution",
    ", we compute the profile as a function of speed . in the fourth section",
    "we introduce the matching procedure for the opposite case of a plate being withdrawn ( receding contact angle ) .",
    "the failure of this matching procedure gives the critical capillary number at which the contact line can no longer exist , in agreement with our earlier result @xcite . for speeds below the critical value we again find the interface profile .",
    "all our analytical results are tested by comparison with numerical solutions of the original equations .",
    "finally , we summarize our results and indicate directions of future research .",
    "as illustrated in fig.[setup ] , we are considering a plate being pushed into or being withdrawn from a liquid bath at an angle @xmath1 .",
    "this means we have to solve the steady navier - stokes equation with a free surface , and no - slip boundary conditions on the plate .",
    "since the plate is moving with speed u , the contact line between fluid , solid , and gas is _ moving relative to the solid_. as explained above , the navier - stokes equation does not allow such a solution , and a small - scale cutoff has to be introduced at the contact line @xcite .",
    "the dominant mechanism responsible for cutoff depends on the particular system under study @xcite . as a representative example",
    ", we assume that the corner singularity is relieved by allowing the fluid to slip across the solid surface , since the matching to the slip region of size @xmath0 is well understood in this case @xcite . according to the navier",
    "slip law @xcite , the fluid speed relative to the solid is proportional to the shear rate : @xmath29 recently , we found @xcite that various modifications of ( [ navier ] ) have a minimal influence on the interface away from the contact line .",
    "hence we do not believe that the particular cutoff mechanism used is of great importance .",
    "a much thornier issue is the slope @xmath30 of the fluid layer to be specified at the contact line .",
    "it is well appreciated that molecular processes are involved @xcite , which are beyond a hydrodynamic description .",
    "this will lead to a an effective _ speed dependence _ of the contact angle as defined on a scale of nanometers .",
    "the importance of these microscopic effects relative to hydrodynamic ones is determined by the amount of energy dissipation involved in either process @xcite .",
    "thus for high viscosities the speed dependence of the microscopic angle can most likely be ignored , in agreement with experimental data @xcite .",
    "if there is no `` intrinsic '' speed dependence of the microscopic angle , it must coincide with its equilibrium value @xmath31 at _ zero _ speed .",
    "we thus take @xmath32 .",
    "the mathematical problem simplifies significantly if we assume that the angle the interface makes with the solid is always small , and that viscosity is sufficiently large for inertia to be ignored . in this limit",
    ", one can find an approximate description of the hydrodynamic equations which eliminates the flow field @xcite , and the so - called `` lubrication equation '' can be written entirely in terms of the free - surface profile @xmath33 .",
    "non - dimensionalizing all lengths with the capillary length @xmath11 one finds @xcite @xmath34 where we consistently used the small - angle approximation @xmath35 . to distinguish more clearly between advancing and receding contact lines",
    "we always take @xmath36 as a _ positive _ quantity , and rather change the sign in the equation .",
    "the - sign corresponds to the plate plunging into the liquid , the + sign to the opposite case of the plate being withdrawn .",
    "viscous forces appear on the left of ( [ lub ] ) ( proportional to the speed ) , and diverge quadratically as @xmath37 goes to zero at the contact line . as a result , viscous dissipation would diverge if it were not for the presence of slip , which weakens the singularity . near the contact line the surface is highly curved , so the first term on the right of ( [ lub ] ) , which comes from surface tension , balances the viscous term on the left .",
    "the other two terms stem from gravity and only come into play at greater distances from the contact line .",
    "the film thickness vanishes at the contact line , where the slope is @xmath32 as discussed above . far away from the plate",
    "the surface coincides with the liquid bath , so the third boundary condition is @xmath38 . rescaling the layer thickness @xmath37 with the equilibrium contact angle @xmath31",
    ", one finds that there remain _ three _ parameters in the problem , namely the combinations @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 .",
    "however , we find it more intuitive to keep the original parameters , and to state results in terms of the above combinations if convenient .",
    "we begin by considering a plate being pushed into a viscous fluid , corresponding to the - sign in ( [ lub ] ) . in the spirit of the matching condition ( [ match_cond ] ) we approach this problem by first considering the leading - order behavior near the contact line , where @xmath37 goes to zero . as discussed above ,",
    "this equation @xcite is @xmath42 which we studied in detail in @xcite for a more general class of slip models .",
    "the characteristic scale of the local solution is the slip length @xmath0 , so it is convenient to introduce the scaled variables ( [ scal ] ) , which leads to @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the rescaled capillary number .    as argued above , the matching condition ( [ match_cond ] ) leads to the requirement that the curvature @xmath45 _ vanishes _ for large @xmath46 as the limit @xmath47 is performed .",
    "this means that the boundary conditions for the solution of ( [ sim ] ) are @xmath48 the only parameter now appearing in the problem is the rescaled capillary number @xmath49 , and equations ( [ sim])-([bc ] ) uniquely specify the profile close to the contact line .",
    "this inner solution can be found by expanding in a power series in the capillary number in a manner described in many papers @xcite .",
    "if one writes the solution in terms of @xmath50 , its behavior for large @xmath51 can be written as @xmath52 to any order in the capillary number @xcite .",
    "this is the form originally proposed by voinov @xcite , using more qualitative arguments .",
    "the length @xmath53 appearing inside the logarithm can be computed as a power series in the capillary number : @xmath54,\\ ] ] but for simplicity we only take the leading order term into account here , as corrections introduced by the next order are usually quite small @xcite .",
    "the crucial point of representing the inner solution in the form ( [ voinov ] ) is that the only parameter multiplying @xmath55 is the capillary number , which is defined in terms of the `` outer '' problem .",
    "namely , the outer problem ( [ voinov ] ) needs to be matched to is @xmath56 which does not contain any contact line parameters like @xmath0 or @xmath31 .",
    "owing to the strong singularity for @xmath57 @xcite , ( [ out ] ) does not have a solution with finite slope at the contact line @xmath58 , making it impossible to impose a slope .",
    "instead , we are seeking a solution of ( [ out ] ) that has the form ( [ voinov ] ) for @xmath59 , in other words @xmath60 where @xmath61 is a constant to be computed . as demonstrated in @xcite ,",
    "this can be achieved by expanding the outer solution in a power series in @xmath36 : @xmath62    the equation for @xmath63 , representing a balance of surface tension and gravity , is @xmath64 equation ( [ h0 ] ) has the following family of solutions , which are finite at infinity and which vanish at the contact line : @xmath65 the slope @xmath66 of ( [ h0sol ] ) at the contact line is called the `` apparent '' contact angle and is a free parameter still to be determined by the matching procedure .",
    "its name is motivated by the fact that a macroscopic measurement of the profile on the scale @xmath67 will yield a profile close to ( [ h0sol ] ) .",
    "if extrapolated to the contact line , the angle will appear to be @xmath68 , rather than the true microscopic value @xmath31 .",
    "obviously , ( [ h0sol ] ) can not be matched directly to the contact line solution ( [ voinov ] ) , which contains a logarithm .",
    "this logarithmic dependence will come out of the next - order solution @xmath69 , whose equation reads @xmath70    the solution is straightforward @xcite : @xmath71 where once more any particular solution that is growing at infinity was suppressed , and @xmath72 are constants of integration . to find @xmath72",
    ", we note that @xmath37 must vanish at the contact line , giving the first condition @xmath73 . to compute @xmath74",
    ", we observe that the second integrand of ( [ h1sol ] ) can be expanded like @xmath75 .",
    "the term linear in @xmath76 does not contribute for small @xmath76 , since @xmath77 behaves like @xmath78 for small arguments , and hence @xmath79 thus one finds @xmath80 where the singularity of @xmath81 cancels out to make the second integral convergent .",
    "next we find a condition at infinity by noting that @xmath82 where @xmath3 is vertical distance of the contact line from the undisturbed surface .",
    "since we want @xmath63 to represent the far - field behavior of the profile , we put @xmath83 , and thus @xmath84 , by comparison with ( [ h0sol ] ) .",
    "this means we have @xmath85 the first of the two terms on the right is zero , as one confirms by splitting it into two parts : @xmath86 where @xmath87 is a large positive constant .",
    "the first of the two parts is evidently zero , for the second one notes that the argument can be approximated as @xmath88 for large @xmath89 , whose absolute value has the upper bound @xmath90 .",
    "thus in the limit the second part vanishes as well . using ( [ cc ] )",
    "this means the constant @xmath91 in ( [ h1sol ] ) can be computed as @xmath92    we are now in a position to determine the constant @xmath61 in ( [ match ] ) . comparing ( [ match ] ) to ( [ exp ] ) , we know that for small @xmath76 the first order contribution @xmath93 must have a logarithmic singularity of the form @xmath94 namely , for small @xmath76 @xmath95 so that @xmath96 . analysis of ( [ h1sol ] ) for @xmath59 gives , using ( [ k ] ) and @xmath97 for small @xmath98 , @xmath99 dt + 3.\\ ] ] this completely determines the the outer solution ( [ exp ] ) .",
    "comparing it to the inner solution ( [ voinov ] ) we finally obtain @xmath100 which is an equation to be solved for the apparent contact angle @xmath68 .",

    "remarkably , the prediction , which contains no adjustable parameters , remains extremely good up to a reduced capillary number of @xmath105 . to further appreciate the quality of the agreement",
    ", we plotted the result of an earlier theory @xcite as the dotted line . in this earlier theory ,",
    "a perturbation expansion of ( [ lub ] ) in @xmath36 is matched directly to a linearized version of ( [ voinov ] ) .",
    "however , the expansion is performed around the _",
    "static _ profile corresponding to zero speed , whereas our expansion is around @xmath106 , which already incorporates a speed - dependent deformation of the surface .",

    "however , the behavior of solutions of ( [ simd ] ) as @xmath115 is completely different .",

    "coming from the interior , the inner solution ( [ inout : b ] ) agrees with the full solution up to the turning point .    to obtain a profile that is more uniformly valid",
    ", one can use a composite approximation @xcite .",
    "the idea is to add the inner and outer solutions that have been matched , and to subtract the behavior ( [ comp ] ) in the region in which the two solutions overlap : @xmath177.\\ ] ] it is evident that @xmath178 agrees with the full solution for large _ as well as _ for small @xmath76 , hence it will be the best global approximation at this order of the matching .",
    "this excludes the region @xmath179 where ( [ inout : b ] ) has a logarithmic singularity .",
    "figure [ compfig ] illustrates the remarkable agreement of the composite solution with the full numerical result at the critical capillary number , where the approximation is expected to be _",
    "worst_.     the interface slope at the critical capillary number for @xmath158 and @xmath180 .",
    "the full line is the result of the numerical integration at @xmath159 , while the theoretical prediction ( [ dcr ] ) gives @xmath175 .",
    "the dahes line is the composite solution ( [ composite ] ) . ]",
    "having studied the critical capillary number , let us return once more to the matching condition ( [ det ] ) which determines the solutions for @xmath181 .",
    "namely , it is instructive to obtain explicit solutions of ( [ det ] ) in the limit of _ small _ @xmath36 , in which case its solution @xmath127 is large , and the asymptotics of the airy function @xcite gives @xmath182 thus , ( [ det ] ) becomes for small @xmath36 : @xmath183 and ( [ app ] ) is @xmath184 in the simplest approximation the exponent in ( [ dets ] ) must vanish , @xmath185 , and inserting this into ( [ bsm ] ) gives @xmath186 .",
    "not surprisingly , at very small capillary numbers the interface is hardly deformed at all .    to go beyond this approxiamtion",
    ", we put @xmath187 , insert into ( [ dets ] ) , and analyze the result for small @xmath36 , which gives @xmath188.\\ ] ] putting this into ( [ bsm ] ) leads to the next approximation @xmath189,\\ ] ] which is similar to equation ( [ ap ] ) for the apparent contact angle in the advancing case . indeed , for small capillary number ( [ ap ] ) becomes @xmath190,\\ ] ] which has the same form as ( [ vdr ] ) .",
    "however , even for small capillary number the receding and the advancing case needs to be treated differently , as the constant inside the logarithm is _",
    "different_. for @xmath191 the argument of the logarithm in ( [ vdr ] ) becomes singular , which means one has to go to an even higher order in the approximation , but we are not pursuing this special case here .",
    "the approximation ( [ vdr ] ) is plotted as the dashed line in fig.[appfig ] .",
    "if extrapolated naively to @xmath162 , it gives a surprisingly good estimate of @xmath160 .",
    "let us begin by considering rather straightforward extensions and generalizations of the present theory .",
    "firstly , our arguments are not limited to a specific contact line model , since they are based entirely on hydrodynamic arguments _ away _ from the contact line .",
    "for example , if van - der - waals forces are dominant near the contact line @xcite , this only changes the parameter @xmath53 appearing in ( [ voinov ] ) ( advancing contact angle ) or @xmath133 in ( [ small ] ) ( receding contact line ) . in the latter case , the slip length @xmath0 in ( [ dcr ] ) has to be replaced by @xmath192 , where @xmath193 is the hamaker constant .",
    "our research also suggests that the calculation of the critical capillary number is captured fully by lubrication theory , even if @xmath31 is _ not _ small . in that case the flow directly at the contact line would have to be described without resorting to lubrication theory @xcite , but the relevant region where matching occurs is characterized by slopes @xmath109 which _ are _ small .",
    "secondly , one can generalize to a different geometry . to this end",
    "one has to replace ( [ h0sol ] ) by the appropriate static solution for the problem at hand .",
    "this is done almost trivially for the case of a _ vertical _ plate or a fiber @xcite , in which case the lubrication description ( [ lub ] ) is no longer valid far from the contact line , since @xmath1 is not small .",
    "this however does not pose a problem since this part of the profile is determined by surface tension and gravity alone . in the same spirit",
    ", the present model can be exteded to a flow inside a capillary tube , with only very minor changes to the value of the critical capillary number @xcite .",
    "thirdly , one can consider dynamical effects , of particular interest for the unstable case of a receding contact line .",
    "in @xcite it was found that when the stationary profile vanishes , it is not followed directly by the lld film , which is of macroscopic thickness .",
    "rather , there is a narrow range of speeds where the contact line is pulled up the plate , but at a speed that is _ smaller _ than @xmath6 , i.e. the contact line is partially slipping .",
    "the thickness of the film that is left behind is in the order of @xmath0 , i.e. _ microscopic_. only when the speed is raised still further does the lld film appear .",
    "so far these results are only numerical ; a full analytical theory would be desirable .",
    "note also that these transitions are strongly hysteretical .",
    "once the lld film has appeared , it can be sustained to much lower capillary numbers than @xmath160 .",
    "it is usually assumed that the lld film vanishes when its thickness has reached the range of intermolecular forces @xcite , but we are not aware of any theoretical investigation of this problem .",
    "next we come to the experimental evidence .",
    "the most extensive experiments on the critical capillary number for a receding contact line were done with a capillary tube @xcite , by pushing out a viscous liquid . using a variety of different materials",
    "it was found that instability occurs at a given value of the reduced capillary number @xmath39 , in agreement with the present theory .",
    "the actual value of the critical capillary number , however , is about a factor of two too low , if the theoretical estimates are based on @xmath194 nm .",
    "several possible explanations suggest themselves .",
    "first , the materials used in @xcite have considerable contact angle hysteresis , pointing to surface roughness",
    ". this will tend to reduce the critical capillary number @xcite .",
    "in addition , any speed dependence of the microscopic contact angle , neglected in the present description , will effectively lower @xmath31 and thus lead to a smaller critical capillary number .",
    "our theory for the vanishing of the receding contact line has some similarities with an earlier theory @xcite , in that the critical capillary number is proportional to @xmath195 ( cf .",
    "( [ dcr ] ) ) . however , it differs in predicting a vanishing apparent contact angle at the transition , while it is @xmath196 in @xcite .",
    "the approach of @xcite is also different in that it considers the local problem in isolation , hence the dependence of @xmath160 on parameters of the outer problem like @xmath1 can not be captured .",
    "in fact , we believe that the mechanism for instability proposed in @xcite , which is based on an approximate solution of ( [ simd ] ) , contains a flaw .",
    "in @xcite we use the case of the advancing contact angle ( [ sim ] ) to show that the method of solution proposed in @xcite can not correctly predict the nonlinear dependence of the angle on speed .",
    "but it is precisely this nonlinear dependence which lies at the heart of the stability analysis of @xcite .",
    "the most important extension of the present theory of contact line instability however is its application to higher dimensions , in which the contact line no longer remains straight .",
    "if the plate withdrawn from the liquid bath is sufficiently wide , the contact line inclines relative to its direction of motion .",
    "two sections of the contact line that have inclined in opposite senses meet at a sharp corner , so that the whole contact line is serrated in an irregular fashion @xcite .",
    "a more controlled recent experiment is that of a viscous drop running down an inclined plane @xcite . at a critical speed ,",
    "the initially rounded tail of the drop forms a sharp corner .",
    "a recent theory @xcite explains the drop profile near the corner of the drop , but not the critical speed at which the the corner first occurs , nor its opening angle . to give a complete description of the transition , the microscopic neighborhood of the contact line has to be included , as was done in the present theory for a straight contact line . one important difference between the case of a sliding drop and that of the present paper is that recent experimental evidence suggests that the transition occurs at a _",
    "finite _ value of the apparent contact angle @xcite .",
    "studies to understand the three - dimensional instability of a sliding drop are currently under way .",
