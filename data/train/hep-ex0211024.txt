    "the vacuum polarization correction to the photon propagator is closely related to the hadronic cross section .",
    "the hadronic correction to the muon anomaly @xmath5 can therefore be calculated from measurements of the hadronic cross section in  annihilations via a dispersion relation : @xmath6 the kernel @xmath7 is given by many authors and behaves approximately as @xmath8 .",

    "the new cmd-2 measurement of the dominant process @xmath21 with a @xmath22 precision is chiefly responsible for the significant reduction of the error of @xmath23 in the second analysis , which now shows a @xmath24 deviation from the experimental value , while the analysis based on @xmath11 data gives only a @xmath25 effect . clearly , new ,",

    "since an initial state photon is emitted preferably at small polar angles , and the polar angle distribution of the photon from fsr follows the pion sin@xmath75 distribution , the fsr to isr ratio changes considerably with the polar angle of the two pion system , @xmath67 . for the small angle phase space region described above ( @xmath76 )",
