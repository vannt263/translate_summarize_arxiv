    "some recent developments in the theory of group actions on complex manifolds have revealed unexpected connections between the geometry of manifolds and the geometry of graphs .",
    "our purpose in this semi - expository paper is twofold : first , to explore these connections ; and second , to discuss some problems in graph theory which `` manifold '' ideas have helped to clarify .",
    "one such problem is that of counting the number of @xmath1 dimensional faces of a simple @xmath2-dimensional convex polytope . this number can be expressed as a sum @xmath3 where the @xmath4 s are positive integers .",
    "a celebrated conjecture of mcmullen @xcite asserts that these integers satisfy the identities @xmath5 and the inequalities @xmath6 where @xmath7 . in 1980 , richard stanley @xcite solved mcmullen s conjecture ; his proof involved showing that the @xmath8 s are the betti numbers of a complex projective variety , and hence that ( [ eq:2 ] ) is just poincar duality and ( [ eq:3 ] ) is the `` hard lefshetz '' theorem .",
    "another such problem is the classical _ parallel redrawing _ problem : given a graph embedded in @xmath9 , how many ways can one reposition the vertices so that the edges of the deformed graph are parallel to the edges of the original graph ? we show that the number of such deformations can be counted by a combinatorial invariant involving the zeroth and first `` betti numbers '' of the graph .    in the remainder of this section",
    ", we describe how graph theoretical structures occur in the study of group actions on complex manifolds .",
    "this section provides much of the geometric motivation for the graph theory that follows . although the remainder of the paper does not depend on this section , the reader is strongly encouraged to acquaint herself with the ideas discussed here , particularly with the examples given in section  [ subse : egs ] .",
    "the rest of the paper is graph theoretical .",
    "we give purely graph - theoretic definitions of various combinatorial notions associated with the graphs coming from manifolds .",
    "however , we make our definitions sufficiently broad so as to apply to many graphs which are _ not _ associated with group actions on manifolds . in sections  [ se : conn ] through [ se : betti ] , we define the notions of _ connection _ and _ morse function _ on a regular graph , and using `` morse theory , '' we define the _ betti numbers _ of a graph .",
    "then in section  [ se : simple ] , we take up the problem mentioned above : counting the number of @xmath1 dimensional faces of a simple @xmath2-dimensional convex polytope , @xmath10 , and show that the @xmath11 s in equation  ( [ eq:1 ] ) are just the betti numbers of @xmath10 .",
    "we also provide in this section a brief description of stanley s proof of the mcmullen conjectures .    in section  [ se : poly ]",
    ", we discuss another problem in which graph theoretical betti numbers play an important role .",
    "this problem is a polynomial interpolation problem for graphs which generalizes , in some sense , the classical problem of lagrangian interpolation for polynomials of one variable .",
    "for instance , for the complete graph on @xmath2 vertices , this problem consists of finding a polynomial in one variable , @xmath12 whose coefficients @xmath13 are polynomials in @xmath14 such that the expressions @xmath15 are pre - assigned polynomials in the @xmath16 s .",
    "we will show that is solvable if and only if @xmath17 so can be regarded as a formula for the general solution of the system of equations .",
    "one encounters systems of equations of the type involving more complicated graphs in the area of combinatorics known as spline theory .",
    "furthermore , they come up , somewhat unexpectedly , in the theory of manifolds .",
    "the computation of the equivariant cohomology rings of manifolds we describe in the examples below involves solving such equations .",
    "we will not attempt to discuss equivariant cohomology in this article , but interested readers can find details in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .    in section  [ se : poly ] , we will show how a connection on a graph enables one to construct many explicit solutions to interpolation equations of this type . in section",
    "[ se : para ] , we will show that the dimension of the space of solutions of degree @xmath18 is given by a formula similar to the mcmullen formula .",
    "moreover for @xmath19 , this formula will solve the parallel redrawing problem for a large class of interesting graphs . in section  [ sec:8 ]",
    ", we will discuss some connections between this formula and mcmullen s formula , and show that this resemblance between the two is not entirely fortuitous .",
    "more explicitly , we show that the face counting problem for polytopes can be viewed as an interpolation problem for polynomials in `` anti - commuting '' variables .",
    "finally , in section  [ se : egs ] , we provide several families of examples of graphs to which this theory applies and some open questions . in the interest of brevity",
    ", many details of this section are left to the reader .",
    "we are grateful to many colleagues and friends for enlightening comments about various aspects of this paper .",
    "in particular , the proof of theorem  [ th : interp ] is , with minor modifications , identical to that of theorem  2.4.1 in @xcite .",
    "we are grateful to catalin zara for letting us reproduce this argument here , and also for a number of helpful comments and insights .",
    "we would also like to thank werner ballmann , sara billey , daniel biss , rebecca goldin , allen knutson , sue tolman , david vogan , and walter whitely for helpful conversations .      henceforth , we denote by @xmath20 the multiplicative group of non - zero complex numbers , and by @xmath21 the group @xmath22 let @xmath23 be a @xmath24-dimensional compact complex manifold , and @xmath25 a holomorphic action of @xmath21 on @xmath23 . the action @xmath26",
    "is called a _ gkm action _ if there are a finite number of @xmath21 fixed points and a finite number of @xmath21 orbits of ( complex ) dimension one .",
    "an important example is the riemann sphere @xmath27 with the standard action of @xmath20 .",
    "this is the action @xmath28=[c\\cdot z_0:z_1],\\ ] ] where @xmath29 $ ] are standard homogeneous coordinates on @xmath27 .",
    "this action has two fixed points , the origin , @xmath30 $ ] , and the point at infinity , @xmath31 $ ] . the complement of these points is a single @xmath20 orbit .    when @xmath26 is a gkm action , we let @xmath32 be the set of fixed points of @xmath26 and @xmath33 the set of one - dimensional orbits .",
    "it is not hard to show that thes objects satisfy    1 .",
    "[ it1 ] the closure of each @xmath34 is an embedded copy of the complex projective line , @xmath27 ; 2 .",
    "[ it2 ] if the closure of @xmath35 intersects the closure of @xmath36 , the intersection is a single point @xmath37 .",

    "[ it3 ] the closure of each @xmath39 contains exactly two fixed points ; 4 .   [ it4 ]",
    "every fixed point is contained in the closure of exactly @xmath24 one - dimensional orbits ; and 5 .",
    "[ it5 ] the action of @xmath21 on the closure of @xmath39 is isomorphic to the standard action of @xmath20 on @xmath27 .",
    "this last item needs some explaining , which we postpone until the next section .",
    "goresky , kottwitz , and macpherson point out in @xcite that the properties  ( [ it1 ] ) through ( [ it4 ] ) are nicely expressed in the language of graph theory .",
    "let @xmath40 be the graph having vertex set @xmath41 and edge set @xmath42 , where @xmath34 joins @xmath37 and @xmath43 in @xmath44 exactly when @xmath37 and @xmath43 are the two fixed points of @xmath21 in the closure of @xmath39 .",
    "we call @xmath40 the _ gkm graph _ of the pair @xmath45",
    ".    properties  ( [ it1 ] ) through ( [ it4 ] ) tell us that @xmath40 is a particularly nice graph .",
    "for instance , properties  ( [ it2 ] ) and ( [ it3 ] ) imply that there are no loops and no multiple edges in @xmath40 .",
    "property  ( [ it4 ] ) tells us that @xmath40 is a _",
    "@xmath24-regular graph _ :",
    "each vertex has valence @xmath24 .",
    "property  ( [ it5 ] ) does not have a purely combinatorial interpretation .",
    "it specifies a way to assign a vector in @xmath9 to each edge of @xmath40 , and so provides a kind of embedding of @xmath40 .",
    "suppose @xmath39 is the edge joining @xmath37 and @xmath43 .",
    "to specify an orientation of @xmath39 , we decide which of @xmath37 and @xmath43 is the initial vertex @xmath46 of @xmath39 and which the terminal vertex @xmath47 of @xmath39 .",
    "property  ( [ it5 ] ) says that the action of @xmath21 on the closure of @xmath39 is isomorphic to the standard action of @xmath20 on @xmath27 .",
    "this means that there is a group homomorphism @xmath48 and a bi - holomorphic map @xmath49 such that @xmath50 for all @xmath51 and for all @xmath52 .",
    "the homomorphism @xmath53 and the map @xmath54 are more or less unique . the only way that @xmath54 can be altered is by composing it with a bi - holomorphic map of @xmath27 which commutes with the action of @xmath20 , and the group of such bi - holomorphisms consists of @xmath20 itself and the involution @xmath55 ) = [ z_1:z_0]\\ ] ] which flips the fixed points at zero and infinity . moreover ,",
    "if @xmath54 is composed with an element of @xmath20 , @xmath53 is unchanged , and composition with @xmath56 interchanges @xmath53 with @xmath57 . in particular",
    ", @xmath53 is determined when we specify which of the two points of @xmath58 maps to zero and which to infinity .    in the coordinate system determined by the expression of @xmath21 as a product of @xmath20 ,",
    "this intertwining homomorphism has the form @xmath59 note that the @xmath60 are integers because they are characters of the group @xmath61 .",
    "so to every oriented edge @xmath39 of @xmath40 , we can attach the @xmath2-tuple of integers @xmath62",
    "if we reverse the orientation of @xmath39 , then @xmath53 becomes @xmath57 and @xmath63 becomes @xmath64 .",
    "we call the map @xmath65 the _ axial function _ of the graph @xmath40 .",
    "the rationale for the name `` axial function '' is that the map @xmath66 describes how each of the two - spheres @xmath67 gets rotated about its axis by the torus subgroup @xmath68 of @xmath21 .",
    "we describe below a few typical examples of gkm graphs .",
    "the reader should make herself familiar with these examples since they will resurface frequently in the remainder of the paper .    * the @xmath2-simplex . *",
    "let @xmath69 be complex projective @xmath70 space , represented using homogeneous coordinates in @xmath71 , and let @xmath21 act on @xmath23 by the product action @xmath72=[g_1\\cdot z_1:\\cdots : g_n\\cdot z_n].\\ ] ] the fixed points of this action are the points @xmath73 $ ] , and the one - dimensional orbits are the sets @xmath74\\}$ ] , points with non - zero entries in just two components .",
    "it follows easily that the intersection graph is @xmath75 , the complete graph on @xmath2 points .",
    "moreover , if we choose zero and infinity in @xmath76 to be the point with @xmath77th coordinate zero and @xmath78th coordinate zero respectively , then the intertwining homomorphism is @xmath79 since in homogeneous coordinates , @xmath80=[c_iz : c_jw].\\ ] ] thus , @xmath81 , with a @xmath82 in the @xmath77th position and a @xmath83 in the @xmath78th position .",
    "if we embed the graph @xmath75 in @xmath9 by sending the vertex @xmath73 $ ] to the point @xmath84 , this computation shows that the edge joining two vertices does indeed have the direction @xmath63 .",
    "thus , we have proved the following proposition .",
    "the graph @xmath40 of @xmath23 is the one - skeleton ( vertices and edges ) of the @xmath85-simplex @xmath86 and for every edge @xmath39 of this embedded graph , @xmath63 is the embedded image of @xmath39 .",
    "* the hypercube .",
    "* let @xmath23 be @xmath87 then @xmath21 acts on @xmath23 by the product action , @xmath88 and the fixed points for this action are the points @xmath89 where @xmath90 is zero or the point at infinity of the @xmath77th copy of @xmath27 in the product ( [ 3.1 ] ) .",
    "it is easy to see that the one - dimensional orbits of @xmath21 are just the sets @xmath91 where @xmath92 .",
    "we leave the proof of the following proposition as an exercise :    the graph of @xmath23 is the one - skeleton of the hypercube @xmath93\\times\\cdots\\times [ 0,1]}_{n}\\ ] ] in @xmath9 , and for every edge @xmath39 of this embedded graph , @xmath63 is the embedded image of @xmath39 .",
    "note that this embedding of the graph does give us the axial function as well .",
    "this construction naturally generalizes to the product of any set of gkm manifolds .    *",
    "the johnson graph .",
    "* projective space , @xmath94 , is really just the set of lines in complex @xmath2-space @xmath95 .",
    "this example generalizes that construction .",
    "the group @xmath21 acts on @xmath95 with the product action @xmath96 let @xmath23 be the @xmath18-grassmannian @xmath97 : the set of all ( complex ) @xmath18-dimensional subspaces of @xmath95 .",
    "the action of @xmath21 on @xmath95 induces an action of @xmath21 on @xmath23 , and it is easy to see that the points of @xmath23 which are fixed by this action , that is the @xmath18-dimensional subspaces of @xmath95 which are mapped to themselves by ( [ 3.2 ] ) are the subspaces @xmath98 where @xmath99 is a @xmath18-element subset of @xmath100 . in other words ,",
    "the fixed points for the action of @xmath21 on @xmath23 are indexed by the @xmath18-element subsets of @xmath100 .",
    "the one - dimensional orbits of @xmath21 are not much harder to describe .",
    "let @xmath99 and @xmath101 be @xmath18-element subsets of @xmath100 whose intersection has order @xmath102",
    ". then the collection of all @xmath18-dimensional subspaces @xmath44 of @xmath95 satisfying @xmath103 is a one - dimensional orbit .",
    "moreover , the sets ( [ 3.3 ] ) are the only one - dimensional orbits .",
    "hence    the gkm graph @xmath40 of @xmath23 is the graph whose vertices correspond to @xmath18-element subsets of @xmath100 , and two such subsets @xmath99 and @xmath101 are adjacent if and only if their intersection is a @xmath104-element set .",
    "if we think of each @xmath18-element set as a vector in in @xmath9 with @xmath18 1 s and @xmath1 0 s in the obvious way then we have embedded @xmath40 in @xmath9 .",
    "the axial function at an edge @xmath39 is the embedded image of @xmath39 .",
    "this graph is known as the _ johnson graph _ , @xmath105 .",
    "@xmath106 is the @xmath82-skeleton of the octahedron , shown below .",
    "although @xmath106 is the cross polytope in dimension three , there is in general no relation between the cross polytopes and the johnson graphs .     *",
    "the one skeleton of a simple convex polytope * a convex @xmath2-dimensional polytope @xmath10 in @xmath9 is _ simple _ if exactly @xmath2 edges meet at each vertex .",
    "given such a polytope , one can associate with it a complex @xmath2-dimensional space @xmath107 and an action on @xmath23 of @xmath0 such that the @xmath18-dimensional orbits are in one - to - one correspondence with the @xmath18-dimensional faces of @xmath10 .",
    "in particular , the zero- and one - dimensional orbits correspond to the vertices and edges of @xmath10 .",
    "thus , this action is a gkm action , and its graph is the one - skeleton of @xmath10 .",
    "we will describe this example in more detail in section  [ se : simple ] .",
    "the first two examples described above , the @xmath2-simplex and the hypercube , are special cases of this example , but the polytopes associated with the johnson graph are not simple .",
    "several recent articles about the topology and geometry of gkm manifolds exploit the fact that topological properties of @xmath23 have combinatorial implications for @xmath40 and that , conversely , given information about @xmath40 , one can draw conclusions about the topology of @xmath23 .",
    "see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . throughout these articles ,",
    "one glimpses a kind of dictionary in which manifold concepts translate to graph concepts and vice versa .",
    "our modest goal in this article is to examine some entries in the `` graph '' column of this dictionary for their own intrinsic ( graph theoretic ) interest .",
    "for instance , in section  [ se : conn ] we will give a combinatorial definition of the notion of a _ connection _ on a graph @xmath40 , _ geodesics _ , _ totally geodesic subgraphs _ of @xmath40 , and the _ holonomy group _ associated to a connection . in section  [ se : axial ] , we define an _ axial function _ on a graph . in section  [ se : betti ] , we discuss _ morse functions _ and define the combinatorial _",
    "betti numbers _ of @xmath40",
    ". then we use those topological notions to prove theorems about graphs .",
    "finally , there are interesting graphs for which these notions make sense which are _ not _ gkm graphs .",
    "for example , the complete bipartite graph @xmath108 has many of these combinatorial structures , but is not associated with a manifold we discuss this and other examples in more detail in section  [ se : egs ] .",
    "let @xmath109 be a graph with finite vertex set @xmath44 and edge set @xmath42 .",
    "we count each edge twice , once with each of its two possible orientations . when @xmath110 and @xmath111 are adjacent vertices we write @xmath112 for the edge from @xmath110 to @xmath111 and @xmath113 for the edge from @xmath111 to @xmath110 .",
    "given an oriented edge @xmath114 , we write @xmath115 for the initial vertex and @xmath116 for the terminal vertex .    the _ star _ of a vertex @xmath110 , written @xmath117 , is the set of edges leaving @xmath110 , @xmath118    the star of a vertex is the combinatorial analogue of the tangent space to a manifold at a point .",
    "a _ connection _ on a graph @xmath40 is a set of functions @xmath119 or @xmath120 , one for each oriented edge @xmath114 of @xmath40 , such that    1 .   @xmath121 , 2 .",
    "@xmath122 , and 3 .",
    "@xmath123 .",
    "it follows that each @xmath124 is bijective , so each connected component of @xmath40 is regular : all vertices have the same valence .",
    "henceforth we will assume @xmath40 comes equipped with a connection @xmath125 .",

    "we inductively define a @xmath18-geodesic as a sequence of @xmath132 vertices in the natural way .",

    "the three consecutive edges @xmath133 of a @xmath126-geodesic will be called an _",
    "edge chain_.    a _ closed geodesic _ is a sequence of edges @xmath134 such that each consecutive triple @xmath135 is an edge chain for each @xmath136 , modulo @xmath2 .    a little care is required to understand when a geodesic is closed , since it may in fact use some edges in @xmath117 multiple times .",
    "it is not closed until it returns to the same pair of edges in the same order .",
    "that is analogous to the fact that a periodic geodesic in a manifold is an immersed submanifold , not an embedded submanifold .",
    "the period completes only when it returns to a point with the same velocity ( tangent vector ) .    because there is a unique closed geodesic through each pair of edges in the star of a vertex",

    "we will sometimes use this fact to describe a connection .",

    "but it is much harder than the proof we gave above of .",
    "so for completeness ( and because it is so elegant ) we will sketch stanley s argument .",
    "the mcmullen inequalities follow from the following two assertions :    1 .",
    "if @xmath23 is a gkm manifold , its manifold betti numbers coincide with its graph theoretical betti numbers",
    ". 2 .   given a simple convex polytope",
    ", there exists a gkm manifold whose graph and axial function are the graph and axial function of the polytope .",
    "the proof of the first of these assertions is by `` manifold '' morse theory and resembles our `` graph '' morse theory computations of section  [ se : betti ] .",
    "we will briefly describe how to prove the second assertion .",
    "if we perturb the vertices of @xmath10 slightly it will still be simple and convex , so without loss of generality , we may assume that the vertices of @xmath10 are rational points in @xmath9 .",
    "for each facet ( _ i.e. _ @xmath70-dimensional face ) @xmath237 of @xmath10 , then we can find an outward pointing normal vector @xmath246 to @xmath247 with relatively prime integer entries .",

    "the map @xmath250 mapping @xmath251 to @xmath252 , where @xmath253 is a group homomorphism .",
    "let @xmath219 be its kernel clearly , @xmath254 now let @xmath255 act on @xmath256 by coordinate - wise multiplication , @xmath257 since @xmath219 is a subgroup of @xmath255 it acts on @xmath256 .",
    "then ( [ eq : quotient ] ) induces an action of @xmath21 on the quotient @xmath258 this quotient space , with its @xmath21 action , is , morally speaking , the manifold @xmath23 that we are looking for .",
    "unfortunately , it is not a manifold , and as a topological space , it is not even hausdorff . fortunately , it is easily desingularized , by deleting from it a finite number of `` non - stable '' orbits of @xmath21 . more explicitly , for every subset @xmath99 of @xmath259 , let @xmath260 it is easy to see that these sets are exactly the @xmath255-orbits in @xmath256 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath237 is a face of @xmath10 , there is a unique subset @xmath99 of @xmath259 for which @xmath261 and to that face , we attach the orbit @xmath262 finally , we define @xmath263    the space @xmath264 is an open subset of @xmath256 on which @xmath219 acts properly and locally freely , and the quotient space @xmath265 is a compact orbifold .    the term `` orbifold '' means that @xmath23 is not quite a manifold .",
    "it does have singularities , but they are fairly benign , and its topological properties , including the behavior of its betti numbers , are the same as those of a manifold .",
    "there is a simple condition equivalent to the assertion that @xmath23 is a manifold : for each vertex @xmath37 of @xmath10 the @xmath2 vectors @xmath266 normal to the @xmath2 facets containing @xmath37 form a _ lattice _ basis of @xmath148 .",
    "that is , every vector in @xmath148 can be written as a linear combination of the @xmath266 s with integer coefficients .    since each of the summands in ( [ eq : toricvar ] ) is a @xmath255 orbit , the @xmath21-orbits in @xmath23 are the sets @xmath267 and a simple computation shows that @xmath268 .",
    "thus , the zero and one dimensional orbits of @xmath23 correspond to the vertices and edges of @xmath10 .",
    "in other words , the action @xmath26 of @xmath21 on @xmath23 is a gkm action and the graph of @xmath269 is the one - skeleton , @xmath40 , of @xmath10 .",
    "let @xmath10 be the @xmath2-simplex @xmath270 then @xmath271 ( a `` @xmath272 '' in the @xmath273 slot ) , and @xmath219 is the diagonal subgroup of @xmath274 : the @xmath2-tuples for which @xmath275 .",

    "note that the action of @xmath219 on @xmath278 is non - hausdorff , as every @xmath219 orbit contains @xmath240 in its closure .",
    "however the action of @xmath219 on @xmath277 is free and proper , and the quotient @xmath279 is just @xmath280 .",
    "thus , in this case , the construction we have just outlined reproduces the first of the examples discussed in section  [ subse : egs ] . for more information about this construction ,",
    "see , for example , @xcite .",
    "let @xmath281 be the polynomial ring in the variables @xmath282 and @xmath283 the @xmath18@xmath284 graded component @xmath281 : the space of homogeneous polynomials of degree @xmath18 .",

    "let @xmath297 be the numbers of vertices of @xmath40 .",
    "an @xmath297-tuple of polynomials @xmath298 is a _ polynomial interpolation scheme _ if for every @xmath299 @xmath300 henceforth we will write @xmath301 for such an @xmath297-tuple .",

    "so @xmath309 is not just a module , but in fact a _ graded ring _ , and @xmath281 sits in this ring as the subring of constant interpolation schemes @xmath310    in this section we describe some methods for constructing solutions of the interpolation equations .",
    "these methods will rely heavily on the ideas that we introduced in sections  [ se : conn ] and [ se : axial ] .",
    "let @xmath311 be an immersion of @xmath40 .",

    "in one important case this construction gives _ all _ solutions of ( [ eq:6.1 ] ) .",
    "namely let @xmath321 be the complete graph on @xmath322 vertices with the natural connection",

    "we think of its vertices as permutations of the entries of the vector @xmath678 .",
    "the convex hull of that embedding is a simple polytope in the @xmath70-dimensional subspace @xmath679 , but the convex hull is only a small part of the story .",
    "the graph is @xmath680-regular .",
    "most of the embedded edges are internal to the polytope .",
    "when so embedded the natural axial function is exact , with inflection free geodesics .",
    "@xmath681 is a regular hexagon together with its diagonals .",

    "it has hexagonal and square faces ( internal and external ) corresponding to natural subgroups @xmath685 and @xmath686 of @xmath683 .",
    "these are totally geodesic subgraphs",
    ". the reader can decide whether the analagous construction produces all totally geodesic subgraphs .",
    "@xmath683 has betti numbers @xmath687 . in general",
    "if we compute the betti numbers for @xmath672 using the generic direction @xmath691 then the number of down edges at @xmath56 is the number of inversions in @xmath56 .",
    "the generating function in the proposition is the one that counts permutations according to the number of inversions .",
    "@xcite          the permutahedra are examples from the class of cayley graphs which have a gkm graph structure which is compatible with their structure as a cayley graph .",
    "@xmath672 corresponds to the full flag manifold of all subspaces of @xmath693 .",
    "cayley graphs are discussed more thoroghly in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath694 be the group of symmetries of the regular @xmath2-gon : the dihedral group with @xmath695 elements .",
    "then @xmath696 is a reflection group of type @xmath697 , following the notational conventions of humphreys @xcite .",
    "it is generated by two reflections , and contains @xmath2 reflections and @xmath2 rotations . if we let @xmath10 be the set of reflections in @xmath696 , then the cayley graph @xmath698 has vertices corresponding to elements of @xmath696 .",
    "@xmath699 is connected to @xmath700 for every @xmath701 .",
    "just half the vertices of @xmath40 correspond to symmetries that preserve the orientation of the @xmath2-gon , and @xmath56 preserves orientation if and only if @xmath702 reverses it .",
    "thus the graph is bipartite .",

    "@xmath703 has a natural holonomy free connection defined just as for the permutahedron , using the reflection generating one vertex from another as the label for the corresponding edge .",
    "the natural embedding of @xmath703 as the vertices of a regular @xmath695-gon produces an exact axial function with inflection free geodesics for that connection .",
    "this class of graphs is particularly interesting because @xmath706 is the graph associated with a manifold in the sense described in section  [ subse : gkm ] only when @xmath707 , so they provide examples where combinatorics may go further than differential geometry .        note that @xmath696 is far from @xmath126-independent .",
    "nevertheless @xmath709 counts the number of parallel redrawings .",
    "there are the three trivial ones ( two translations and the dilation ) and one significant one : rotate the sense preserving symmetries clockwise and others counterclockwise around the circle on which they lie .",
    "figure  [ fig : yyy ] shows the resulting deformation of the hexagon .    explaining the existence of this deformation is worth a digression .",
    "the first remark is that the hypothesis of @xmath126-independence in theorem  [ th:||redrawing ] can be dropped if we assume instead that the axial function is exact , as it is in these cases . for a proof in the context of gkm manifolds ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "thus we do expect to see a nontrivial parallel deformation here .",
    "the theory of rigidity predicts the same deformation .",
    "an _ infinitesimal motion _ of an embedded graph is an assignment of a velocity vector to each vertex in such a way that the length of each edge is ( infinitesimally ) unchanged .",
    "the space of infinitesimal motions includes the euclidean motions and perhaps others . for precise definitions",
    "see @xcite . in the plane",
    "there is a one to one correspondence between infinitesimal motions and parallel redrawings : rotating all the vectors of an infinitesimal motion through a quarter of a turn converts that motion into a parallel redrawing .",
    "translations remain translations .",
    "rotation becomes dilation .",
    "nontrivial motions become nontrivial parallel redrawings .    a nineteenth century theorem ( reproved and generalized in @xcite )",
    "says that a plane embedding of @xmath710 ( for @xmath711 ) is rigid ( no infinitesimal motions ) except when it lies on a conic . in this case",
    "that s just what happens .",
    "the regular @xmath695-gon lies on a circle .",
    "the single nontrivial infinitesimal motion moves the odd permutations radially outward while the even ones move inward at the same velocity .",
    "rotating that motion a quarter of a turn produces the parallel redrawing : half the vertices move clockwise , half counterclockwise . figure  [ fig : yyy ] shows the result for @xmath681 .",
    "finally , even without the picture we could have deduced the existence of the conic on which @xmath681 lies from the the exactness of the axial function together with the dual of pascal s theorem in projective geometry .        whenever the plane containing two adjacent edges of a polytope intersects that polytope in a cycle of edges the one skeleton of the polytope is an embedded graph with a natural axial function .",
    "the polytope need not be simple .",
    "the cuboctahedron , shown below , provides one example .",
    "it is @xmath182-regular with @xmath712 square and @xmath713 triagular faces .",
    "three hexagonal plane sections define three more geodesics .",
    "its betti numbers are @xmath714 so it has one nontrivial parallel redrawing , which dilates four of the triangular faces , converting the square faces to rectangles .",
    "figure  [ figk](a ) shows the _ great stellated dodecahedron _",
    ", from kepler s 1619 _ harmonice mundi_. it is in fact a stellated icosahedron .",
    "it s a simple polytope with pentagrams for faces .",
    "these are the geodesics",
    ". since these are inflection free the betti numbers are well defined .",
    "they are @xmath715 . in this case",
    "@xmath716 does properly count the number of parallel redrawings , since there is one for each of the @xmath717 faces .",
    "however , theorem  [ th:||redrawing ] does not apply because the zeroth betti number for each geodesic is @xmath190 , not @xmath82 .",
    "figure  [ figk](b ) shows kepler s _ small stellated dodecahedron _ , which _ is _ a stellated dodecahedron , its geodesics are @xmath718 pentagrams and @xmath717 equilateral triangles .",
    "the invariant betti numbers are @xmath719 . in this case",
    "@xmath720 counts neither the number of faces in kepler s sense ( as it would for a simple polytope ) nor the number of parallel redrawings .    in the plane ,",
    "however , we can often get a correct count even when hypotheses fail , any @xmath2-gon has @xmath2 parallel redrawings , one for each edge , and @xmath721 as long as poincare duality holds , even when the betti numbers are not invariant . figure  [ fig : zzz ] below shows the dart , whose betti numbers are @xmath722 or @xmath723 depending on the choice of @xmath199 .",
    "finally figure  [ figp ] shows the petersen graph in the plane with two inflection free geodesics that define a connection .",
    "the well defined betti numbers are @xmath724 .",
    "since the axial function is exact we can count parallel redrawings even though it is not @xmath126-independent .",
    "there are @xmath725 .",
    "five correspond to edges of the enclosing pentagon which , when moved independently , force parallel redrawing of the inner pentagram .",
    "the sixth is a dilation of the inner pentagram while the outer pentagon remains fixed .",
    "it corresponds to the infinitesimal motion that rotates the inner pentagram relative to the outer pentagon - an infinitesimal motion possible only because exactness means the radial edges will meet in a point when extended .",
