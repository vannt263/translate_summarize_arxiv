    "in the long history of research on molecular solids , various materials have been synthesized and a rich variety of phenomena have been discovered , e.g. , peierls insulator , mott insulator , charge - ordered state , antiferromagnetic state , spin and charge density wave state , and superconducting state.@xcite for the description of almost all these phases , it has been recognized that only one frontier orbital , the highest - occupied - molecular orbital ( homo ) or lowest - unoccupied - molecular orbital ( lumo ) plays a crucial role .",
    "@xcite the tight - binding approach , where a molecule is regarded as a single site and the various ways of molecular packing are reflected by the anisotropy of inter - site transfer integrals and of inter - site coulomb repulsions , has been successful in the systematic understanding of the origin of various phases .",
    "recently theoretical efforts have been devoted to accurate derivation of the single - orbital hubbard hamiltonian from density - functional theory ( dft ; refs .  ) and wavefunction - based calculations .",
    "@xcite the magnitude of the bare `` on - site '' coulomb interaction within the same molecular orbital ( mo ) of the benchmark ttf molecule was evaluated as @xmath2 5.9 ev , which is reduced to 4.7 ev by taking into account the intra - molecular screening effects .",
    "@xcite the on - site coulomb repulsion is further reduced for larger molecules , as expected , e.g. , in bedt - ttf molecule @xcite where it is estimated @xmath3 ev .",
    "it is generally expected that the intra - molecular screening effects are not so pronounced for larger molecules due to the nature of delocalized molecular orbitals .",
    "@xcite the inter - molecular screening effects have also been analyzed by several approaches .",
    "@xcite    multi - molecular - orbital properties have attracted recent attention in the single - component molecular solids , @xcite such as [ ni(tmdt)@xmath1 and [ au(tmdt)@xmath1 . among these single - component molecular solids , the metallic behavior",

    "the band structure in the so - called normal phase , i.e. , no long - range - ordered state , is examined in terms of the evaluated tight - binding parameters . by noting that the resulting mos exhibit bonding and anti - bonding character between the left and right moieties , we transform the two - orbital model into the fragment mo picture .",

    "it is worth noting that the inter - molecular transfer integral @xmath85 exceeds the intra - molecular transfer integral @xmath84 .",
