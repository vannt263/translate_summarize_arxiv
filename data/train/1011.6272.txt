    "rectangular billiard perturbed by a zero - range perturbation ( eba billiard @xcite ) has been investigated theoretically @xcite and experimentally in microwvave experiments with cavities @xcite . experimental wavefunctions are extracted from either the resonance shift induced by a movable perturber @xcite or obtained by a lorentzian fit of the reflection amplitude measured by a movable antenna @xcite .",
    "however these methods work only for well isolated resonances . in this paper",
    "we discuss the experimental wavefunctions in the case of nearly degenerate states .",
    "the starting point is the general expression for the scattering matrix ( @xmath0-matrix ) for such systems , that we derived in the previous paper @xcite , called part i. it considered the main properties of cavities with point - like perturbations , following the ideas of @xcite . in the derived expression the whole information on the antenna construction",
    "was reduced to four effective constants .",
    "we have shown that a lot of experimental results can be treated within the framework of the developed approach .",
    "we present the general expression for the @xmath0-matrix obtained in part i in section  [ sec : sketch ] of this part .    the practical application of the derived expression for @xmath0-matrix requires to compute the green function of the unperturbed cavity as well as the so - called renormalized green function @xcite . in the general case",
    "the exact computation of these functions is by no means a trivial task .",
    "in @xcite we have shown that for a rectangular cavity the required computation can be performed by an application of ewald s method @xcite .",
    "this observation allowed us to revise the level - spacings statistics of eba billiard @xcite .",
    "ewald s method gives the representation of the ( renormalized ) green function in terms of exponentially convergent series .",
    "this representation fits very well for numerical studies .",
    "the main purpose of the present part ii is a further application of the theory developed in part i to the theoretical description of experimental data obtained in rectangular cavities with particular emphasis to wave functions .",
    "the experimental set - up and results are explained in section  [ sec : exp ] . as it was explained above",
    ", the main advantage of rectangular cavities is the possibility of the exact computation of the @xmath0-matrix even for considerably high frequencies .    in section  [ sec : waveprobing ] of this part",
    "we treat our experimental findings @xcite ( see also figure  [ fig : exp ] ) obtained in the experiment with two antennas in the case of nearly degenerate states .",
    "we show , that while the nodal lines of eigenfunctions of a cavity are either closed or terminate at the boundaries , the nodal lines of the experimental patterns measured in this case may break inside the cavity and reduce to points in the case of degenerate states .",
    "this unavoidable experimental imperfection was not pointed out earlier .",
    "the results of section  [ sec : waveprobing ] are universal and remain valid for cavities with arbitrary shapes .",
    "figure  [ fig : exp](b ) shows a sketch of the apparatus allowing an automatic registration of microwave billiard wavefunctions .",
    "the billiard consists of two parts made of brass : _",
    "i ) _ the upper part is a plate supporting a movable antenna in the center , _ ii ) _ the lower part is a cavity of a required shape ( rectangular in our case ) , drilled - in into a thick plate .",
    "the apparatus was tested with help of a rectangular billiard with side lengths @xmath1 = 340 mm , @xmath2 = 240 mm , and a height of @xmath3 = 8 mm .",
    "a _ fixed _ antenna attached to the lower part at the position @xmath4 = 25 cm , @xmath5 = 14 cm ( circular white / black markers in figure  [ fig : exp](c , d ) ) allowed the registration of transmission spectra as well . thus all components @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 of the scattering matrix could be determined by the vector network analyzer .",
    "each antenna consists of a small copper wire of diameter 0.3 mm attached to a standard sma chassis connector and introduced through a small hole of diameter 1 mm into the resonator .    due to the presence of measuring antennas the resonances",
    "are shifted and broadened . as a consequence the non - overlapping resonance approximation becomes insufficient in the moment where shifts and widths induced by two ( movable and fixed ) antennas and additional broadenings due to the wall absorption are of the same order as the distance between the unperturbed resonances . in figure",
    "[ fig : exp](a ) the spectra for different @xmath5 antenna positions are shown in a frequency range where the perturbation by the antenna is of the order of the frequency distance between neighboring resonances . from the residua of each double lorentzian fit the wave functions are obtained ( see figure  [ fig : exp](c ) and ( d ) ) . in these figures",
    "one sees that dark `` islands '' are connected with each other in several points via light `` bridges '' , which evidently break the nodal lines of the pattern .",
    "the appearance of these bridges and the broken nodal lines of the patterns are the most important experimental imperfections in the case of overlapping resonances .",
    "we discuss these imperfections in details in section [ sec : nearlydegenerate ] . in the billiard geometry described above we found several",
    "nearly degenerate states .",
    "the theoretical description used up to date @xcite had not been fully satisfactory , though describing some of the features of the obtained wavefunctions .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to obtain a full understanding of the experimental pattern , and especially the nodal line structures .",
    "the results are also valid if the perturbing bead method is used to measure wave functions @xcite .",
    "in this section we remind of the general formulas we obtained in part i of the paper .",
    "we have found the following expression for @xmath0-matrix of the cavity with attached antennas : @xmath10^{-1}\\frac{c}{a+ik } , \\label{smatrix1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 are diagonal matrices with elements @xmath12 on diagonals and index @xmath13 denotes a number of an antenna . here",

    "the advantage of the theory in section  [ sec : sketch ] is its universality as compared to the _ n_-poles approximation @xcite .",
    "indeed , the expression for the @xmath0-matrix ( [ eq::sm2 ] ) is equally valid for closed cavities in the cases of isolated and overlapping resonances as well as for open cavities .",
    "the @xmath0-matrix of a microwave cavity contains all available information @xcite .",
    "therefore any quantity of interest should be derived from the measured @xmath0-matrix .",
    "being interested in wavefunction measurements we relate below the scattering matrix to the experimental wavefunction .",
    "however the experimental wavefunction in its turn can be easily related to the eigenmode of the closed cavity only in the case of an isolated resonance .",
    "it was already shown @xcite that for degenerate eigenvalues of the closed cavity one measures a sum of squares of all eigenfunctions corresponding to this eigenvalue . in this section",
    "we go further and obtain a theoretical treatment of the experimental wavefunctions in the case of overlapping resonances .",
    "to probe a wavefunction one uses a movable probing antenna and measures the reflection coefficient . if there are together @xmath25 antennas attached to a cavity , @xmath26 fixed and one movable , the reflection coefficient at the movable antenna is given by @xmath27 . here the index @xmath25 is associated with the movable antenna . in the present case",
    "there are just two antennas , the fixed one in the bottom plate , and the moveable one in the upper part . from ( [ eq::sm2 ] )",

    "the wavefunction can also be associated with a shift of resonance in the complex plane influenced by the motion of the @xmath25-th antenna @xmath45 the described relations between @xmath27 and wavefunctions of the closed cavity lead to two experimental standard techniques to measure wavefunctions .",
    "the wavefunction is either related to a residue or to a shift of a resonance",
    ". however both definitions are based on a single pole approximation and thus possess intrinsic imperfections .",
    "below we analyze both methods in the case of overlapping resonances .",
    "poles @xmath46 of ( [ eq::s11 ] ) can be found from the equation @xmath47 equation ( [ eq::nu-1 ] ) can be easily treated if the pole structure of @xmath48 is known .",
    "let us find the residues of the function @xmath49 .",
    "to this end we will derive the convenient representation for @xmath50 .",
    "this green function can be written in the form @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the green function of the system with @xmath53 antennas , @xmath54 , @xmath55 ( see [ app ] ) .",

    "a lorentz - fit of @xmath27 obtained from the probing antenna gives residues corresponding to the poles @xmath63 of ( [ eq::s11 ] ) .",
    "one associates the residue @xmath64_{\\nu\\nu}^{-1}=%\\\\=    \\frac{1}{[\\partial\\xi^{(\\nu-1)}_{\\beta_\\nu}(\\textbf{r}_\\nu;k^2)/\\partial k^2]_{k = k_\\mu}+i|b_\\nu|^2/2k_\\mu(a_\\nu+ik_\\mu)^2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 are solutions of ( [ eq::nu-1 ] ) , with the modulo square of the @xmath58-th experimental eigenfunction .",
    "when @xmath66 , @xmath67 we can put @xmath68 in ( [ eq::nu-1])-([eq::res ] ) but not in ( [ eq::sprobe ] ) , since otherwise the resonance term in @xmath27 would disappear . then all poles becomes real and the @xmath0-matrix elements become singular .",
    "this approximation breaks immediately the unitarity of the @xmath0-matrix for a closed cavity .",
    "nevertheless , it can be used since it almost preserves the residues as well as the positions of the resonances",
    ".    then ( [ eq::resxi ] ) , ( [ eq::res ] ) can be simplified .",
    "indeed the green function of a closed billiard with @xmath26 scatterers can be written in the form @xmath69 where @xmath70 using the equality following from ( [ eq::xidef ] ) and the standard spectral sum we find @xmath71 ^ 2,\\ ] ] where @xmath72 is the area of the billiard .",

    "the universal form of the representation ( [ eq::zerow ] ) allows one to analyze main features of experimental wave - patterns equally for any number of introduced antennas .",
    "especially simple analysis can be performed if the experimental patterns are associated with changes of resonance positions while the probing antenna is moving inside a cavity .",
    "we perform this analysis for the case of nearly degenerate states .",
    "in @xcite we have shown that in the case of a degenerate state the observed pattern is a sum of squares of all wavefunctions forming the orthogonal basis in the subspace corresponding to the degenerate eigenvalue .",
    "thus an experimentally measured pattern has no longer a simple relation to an individual wavefunction of the unperturbed system .",
    "what is happening in the situation with nearly degenerate states ?",
    "it is clear that when a shift of a resonance due to a presence of a measuring antenna is comparable with the level - spacings , one can not treat an observable wave - pattern as a square of an isolated wavefunction .",
    "one can expect at least that the nodal lines of both eigenfunctions remain in the experimental patterns , since an eigenstate can not be excited by an antenna moving along its nodal line . however this expectation fails .",
    "we show below that in this situation the measured wavefunctions are very peculiar : they can not only be related to isolated wavefunctions , but the nodal lines of these patterns are broken .    for our purpose",
    "it is sufficient to consider the renormalized green function ( [ eq::zerow ] ) in two poles approximation .",
    "substituting it into ( [ eq::nu-1 ] ) with @xmath81 we obtain @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the position of the probing antenna , @xmath84 , @xmath85_{k^2=(z_1+z_2)/2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we assume that @xmath86 is large enough to neglect the influence of all other poles . under this assumption ( [ 2psappr ] )",
    "has two positive solutions @xmath87 .",
    "consider first the possibility of the degeneracy of two solutions @xmath88 of .",
    "the condition @xmath89 seems to define a curve in the plane of the cavity .",
    "however from the form of one can see that there are always two different solutions except for @xmath90 and @xmath91 ( analogously if @xmath92 and @xmath93 ) . thus the degeneracy can occur only if a scatterer is placed somewhere at a nodal line .    since the degeneracy of eigenvalues can occur only at isolated points , in the vicinity of these points eigenvalues should split . consider the nodal line @xmath94 of the function @xmath95 : @xmath96 .",
    "along this line reads @xmath97+d[\\mathbf{r}(\\tau)]=0.$ ] let us assume that @xmath98 for some value of the parameter @xmath99 .",
    "at the point @xmath100 the eigenvalue @xmath101 is twofold degenerate .",
    "+   +   +    let us now consider the line @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is small enough .",
    "the solutions @xmath104 of ( [ 2psappr ] ) along this line read @xmath105 ^ 2 + 4f_1 ^ 2(\\mathbf{r})f_2 ^ 2(\\mathbf{r } ) \\label{eq::k212}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where plus and minus signs correspond to different branches , since @xmath106 .",
    "far from the point @xmath107 we can write @xmath108 in the vicinity of the point @xmath107 the expression @xmath109 changes its sign .",
    "thus in the vicinity of this point along the line @xmath102 an avoided crossing takes place .",
    "figure  [ fig::pat1 ] illustrates what may happen in a wavefunction measurement in the case of nearly degenerated eigenfunctions .",
    "the calculation has been performed for a rectangle with a side ratio of 1/1.01 , i.e. very close to the square .",
    "figures ( a ) show the eigenfunction with quantum numbers @xmath110 and @xmath111 , respectively , for the rectangle without perturbation by an antenna . due to the small side mismatch there is an energy splitting of the the eigenstates of the rectangle .",
    "the avoided crossing allows us to separate properly the patterns corresponding to lower and higher frequencies ( see figure  [ fig::pat1 ] ( c ) ) .",
    "it also shows that a nodal line of an unperturbed eigenfunction may become interrupted ( figure [ fig::pat1](b , c ) center column ) , and the `` bridges '' connecting nodal domains through the nodal line may appear .",
    "these bridges are expected to appear in the case when a shift of a resonance due to an antenna or a perturber is larger than the level - spacing .    on the contrary",
    ", the structure of nodal lines in the first column in figure [ fig::pat1 ] remains .",
    "this is clear since for both resonances the shifts due to the presence of a scatterer has always the same sign . when the influence of the perturbation increases ( @xmath112 decreases ) , the pattern keeping the nodal line structure of the original unperturbed state is concentrating in vicinities of nodal lines of the the other unperturbed state .",
    "the other pattern tends to the sum of squares of two unperturbed wavefunctions ( see figure [ fig::pat1](d ) ) , i.e. tends to the pattern expected for a degenerate state@xcite .",
    "one can see that measured nodal lines for the case of a single scatterer are continuous if the coupling of a scatterer is weak as compared to level spacing . for a stronger coupling nodal lines become interrupted and turn into the points of intersection of nodal lines of @xmath95 and @xmath113 .",
    "now we have all the insights to treat the experimental findings presented in section  [ sec : exp ] .",

    "the eigenvalues of the unperturbed billiard are @xmath117\\simeq \\pi^2 d_x^2[n^2 + 2m^2].\\ ] ] it is easy to show that @xmath118 can be degenerate .",
    "an example is @xmath119 .",
    "figure [ efrb ] illustrates the comparison of numerical simulations with experimentally measured patterns corresponding to the eigenstates with quantum numbers @xmath120 and @xmath121 . in numerical simulations we assumed for simplicity that @xmath122 , @xmath123 do not depend on @xmath124 .",
    "we also assumed that the coupling strength of both antennas is negligible , thus the resonances can be found from zero - width approximation .    in the figures [ efrb]a ) , [ efrb]b ) one sees the original eigenfunctions of the cavity . in figures [ efrb]c ) ,",
    "[ efrb]d ) we neglected the splitting of eigenvalues as well as the influence of the movable antenna .",

    "plotted values are the solutions @xmath125 of ( [ eq::nu-1 ] ) .",
