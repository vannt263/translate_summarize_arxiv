    "exclusive electron scattering from the deuteron target is very interesting by itself , and it also is a very relevant stepping stone towards understanding exclusive electron scattering from heavier nuclei .",
    "the @xmath1 reaction at gev energies allows us - and requires us - to carefully study the reaction mechanism .",
    "it is necessary to consider final state interactions ( fsis ) between the two nucleons in the final state , two - body currents , and isobar contributions . of these",
    ", the fsis can be expected to be the most relevant part of the reaction mechanisms at the gev energy and momentum transfers relevant to the study of the transition from hadronic to quark - gluon degrees of freedom .",
    "for some recent reviews on this exciting topic , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the fact that the deuteron is the simplest nucleus enables us to study all facets of the reaction mechanism in great detail .",
    "anything that can be gleaned from the deuteron will be highly useful for heavier nuclei .",
    "exclusive electron scattering from nuclei is one type of reaction where one may observe color transparency @xcite , and the deuteron itself provides a laboratory for the study of neutrons , e.g. the neutron magnetic form factor @xcite .",
    "the short range structures studied in exclusive electron scattering might even reveal information about the properties of neutron stars @xcite .",
    "it is important to use all available tools to further our understanding of exclusive scattering from the deuteron .",
    "while unpolarized scattering is interesting , polarization observables hold the promise of revealing more detailed information about the reaction mechanism .",
    "it is therefore important and interesting to test one s model for polarized observables , too .    in @xcite",
    ", we performed a fully relativistic calculation of the @xmath1 reaction , using a relativistic wave function @xcite and @xmath2 scattering data @xcite for our calculation of the full , spin - dependent final state interactions ( fsis ) .",
    "the main difference to many other high quality calculations using the generalized eikonal approximation @xcite or a diagrammatic approach @xcite is the inclusion of all the spin - dependent pieces in the nucleon - nucleon amplitude .",
    "full fsis have recently been included in @xcite .",
    "several experiments with unpolarized deuterons are currently under analysis or have been published recently , @xcite .",
    "there are also new proposals for d(e , ep ) experiments at jefferson lab @xcite .    in @xcite",
    ", we focused on observables that are accessible for an unpolarized target and an unpolarized nucleon detected in the final state .",
    "the spin - dependent pieces in our fsi calculation were particularly relevant for the fifth response function , an observable that can be measured only with polarized electron beams .",
    "the spin - dependent contributions also contributed significantly to the strength in the fsi - dominated regions of the unpolarized cross section .",
    "naturally , experiments with polarization of the target or ejectile are harder to perform than their unpolarized counterparts .",
    "however , the extra effort allows one to study otherwise inaccessible observables that are rather sensitive to certain properties of the nuclear ground state and the reaction mechanism .",
    "recently , we investigated the target polarization in @xmath3 and @xmath4 @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we study the asymmetries accessible with a polarized ejectile proton , and a polarized or unpolarized electron beam . as before ,",
    "the focus of our numerical calculations is the kinematic region accessible at gev energies , i.e. the kinematic range of jefferson lab .",
    "recoil polarization measurement have often been performed for @xmath5 reactions , to measure the neutron electric form factor via polarization transfer .",
    "these measurements typically take place at rather low missing momentum .",
    "we can perform @xmath6 calculations just as easily as @xmath7 calculations . for simplicity , we focus on ejectile proton polarization in our numerical results .",
    "a measurement of two recoil proton polarizations for low missing momentum and various @xmath8 , up to @xmath9 gev@xmath10 , was performed at jefferson lab @xcite .",
    "this was an interesting experiment that used the deuteron as a proton target , and checked if the deuteron is a good proton target - this is relevant for using the deuteron as a neutron target . at much lower @xmath8 , there are data from mainz @xcite and bates @xcite for hydrogen and deuteron targets .",
    "recoil polarimetry has been used more often for hydrogen targets than deuteron targets , also at jefferson lab @xcite .",
    "recoil polarimetry continues to be an interesting experimental technique @xcite , and it has been used also for heavier nuclei @xcite , for photodisintegration @xcite and in pion production @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in the next section , we introduce the necessary formalism to define the relevant observables . in particular , we discuss how to define reduced responses with explicit dependence on the azimuthal angle of the proton , and we discuss the projection of the proton spin on the most suitable coordinate system .",
    "we define six relevant asymmetries . then , we present our numerical results , in a kinematic region relevant to experiments at jefferson lab .",
    "we show momentum distributions of all six asymmetries , and we discuss the contributions of the various spin - dependent parts of the final state interactions .",
    "we conclude with a brief summary .",

    "the mott cross section is @xmath40 and the recoil factor is given by @xmath41 the leptonic coefficients @xmath42 are @xmath43 within this general framework , we have two options for evaluating the response functions : first , we will give expressions for the response functions in terms of matrix elements that are defined with respect to the electron plane , i.e. the @xmath14 plane .",
    "these matrix elements are implicitly dependent on @xmath21 , the angle between hadron plane and electron plane , and these are the responses used e.g. in @xcite .",
    "second , we give expressions for the responses in the @xmath22 plane .",
    "all quantities given relative to the @xmath22 coordinate system are denoted by a line over the quantity .",
    "the current matrix elements , and therefore the response functions , in the @xmath22 coordinate system do not have any @xmath21 dependence .",
    "it is much more practical to evaluate the responses in the @xmath22 coordinate system .",
    "the commonly used responses in the @xmath14 system can then easily be obtained by accounting for the @xmath21 dependence explicitly , see eq.([connection ] ) below , instead of newly evaluating matrix elements for each value of @xmath21 .",
    "note that both coordinate systems use the same quantization axis : the @xmath15 axis and the @xmath23 axis are parallel .",
    "the hadronic tensor for production of polarized protons is defined as @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 is the charge operator .",
    "the notation @xmath47 in the final state indicates that the state satisfies the boundary conditions appropriate for an `` out '' state .",
    "the operator @xmath48 is a spin projection operator that projects the proton spin onto unit vector @xmath49 which corresponds to the direction of the proton spin in its rest frame relative to the @xmath14-system .",

    "calculating the responses in this system offers a faster alternative to the above calculation , which requires a new evaluation of the current matrix elements for each @xmath21 value .",
    "the response functions defined above are implicitly dependent upon the angle @xmath21 between the electron plane and the hadron plane containing the proton and neutron in the final state .",
    "this dependence can be made explicit by noting that @xmath51 where the line over the matrix elements is used to indicate that they are quantized relative to the @xmath22 coordinate system .",
    "the hadronic tensor can then be written as @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 is the spin projection operator defined relative to the @xmath22 coordinate system .",
    "note that this can be obtained by simply decomposing the unit vector @xmath49 in terms of the @xmath22 basis .",

    "it is often convenient to use a simplified notation for these new response functions where @xmath71 and @xmath72 corresponds to the unpolarized response .",
    "note that when @xmath20 is either @xmath73 or @xmath74 , the hadron plane , and therefore the angle @xmath21 , is no longer defined . as a result",
    "the cross section at these angles must be independent of the azimuthal angle @xmath21 .",
    "this imposes constraints on the reduced response functions .",
    "the constraints can be obtained by writing the response functions @xmath75 of ( [ respdefbar ] ) for arbitrary @xmath49 in terms of the @xmath76 with the inner products given explicitly as functions of @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "each of the @xmath75 can be expanded to lowest order about @xmath77 .",

    "all of the coefficients of non - constant terms in the fourier series must vanish in the limit @xmath78 .",
    "the resulting equations result in constraints on the @xmath76 . from this analysis , the response functions @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 are unconstrained at these angles while @xmath84 and @xmath85 for @xmath86 .",
    "all other response functions must vanish at forward and backward angles .",
    "the definition of asymmetries for polarized protons must be done carefully .",
    "experiments to date have been done for the case where @xmath87 . in this case",
    "the asymmetries have been determined relative to the unit vectors @xmath61 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 . however , the use of this approach for out - of - plane measurements results in asymmetries that depend on @xmath21 when @xmath86 .",
    "therefore , our goal is to define a coordinate system that will be defined unambiguously even if @xmath86 .",
    "it turns out that a reference frame suggested by the experimental set - up fulfills this requirement .",
    "another approach can be defined by noting that if a magnetic spectrometer is used to detect the proton , out - of - plane angles are most conveniently reached by tilting the spectrometer relative to the lab floor with the horizontal direction in the spectrometer remaining fixed . as a result , a new set of coordinates can be chosen such that the longitudinal axis lies along the direction of the proton and the sideways direction remains parallel to the electron scattering plane .",
    "the unit vectors defining this system are then given by @xmath88    choosing @xmath89 , the unpolarized part of the cross section , which is independent of @xmath90 can be written as @xmath91 and the part of the cross section proportional to @xmath90 can be written as @xmath92 and choosing @xmath93 or @xmath94 can be used to obtain the contributions @xmath95 and @xmath96    the single and double asymmetries are now defined as @xmath97 and @xmath98 where @xmath99 .",

    "full fsis have recently been included in @xcite .    to construct the scattering amplitudes needed for the calculation of the fsis",
    "we start with @xmath100 helicity matrices extracted from said @xcite .",
    "the on - shell scattering amplitudes can be given in terms of five fermi invariants as @xmath101 where @xmath102 and @xmath103 are the usual mandelstam variables .",
    "the fermi invariants are then determined using the helicity amplitudes .",
    "a table of the invariant functions is constructed in terms of @xmath102 and the center of momentum angle @xmath104 .",
    "the table is then interpolated to obtain the invariant functions at the values required by the integration .    in order to estimate the possible effects of this contribution to the current matrix elements , we use a simple prescription for the off - shell behavior of the amplitude .",
    "although additional invariants are possible when the nucleon is allowed to go off shell , we keep only the forms in ( [ fermi ] ) .",

    "there are several ways to decompose and parametrize the @xmath2 scattering amplitude .",
    "it can be parametrized with five terms : a central , spin - independent term , a spin - orbit term , and three double - spin flip contributions .",
    "it can also be given in terms of invariants , using a scalar , vector , tensor , pseudoscalar , and axial term .",
    "some of these parametrizations may be more or less useful and enlightening in trying to understand what is happening .",
    "as we are interested in the ejectile polarization , investigating the effects of spin - dependent terms in the fsis is a logical and interesting step .",
    "we separate the nn amplitudes into a central term , a single spin - flip ( i.e. spin - orbit ) term , and three double spin - flip terms , for details on these saclay amplitude conventions , see @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig_spindepfsi ] , we show the contributions of the central , central and single spin - flip , and full fsis to the six asymmetries at @xmath115 gev@xmath10 , @xmath116 , and @xmath124 .",
    "the clear message from this figure is that a calculation including only central fsis will fail completely for missing momenta beyond @xmath126 gev .",
    "for the three asymmetries accessible with an unpolarized beam , the central fsi on its own leads to a mostly zero asymmetry , whereas spin dependent fsis lead to large structures in these observables .",
    "for the asymmetries accessible with a polarized electron beam only , the purely central fsi leads to non - zero results for the asymmetries , but the inclusion of spin - dependent fsis leads to huge changes , both of the shape and size .",
    "the differences between the full fsis and the fsis without the three double spin - flip terms is largest for @xmath112 , where the double spin - flip contribution leads to a broad bump for missing momenta from @xmath127 gev to @xmath128 gev .",
    "the double spin - flip contributions to @xmath113 are significant as well , leading to an increase in the magnitude of the asymmetry for medium missing momenta .",
    "the double spin effects for @xmath117 , are smaller , leading to a reduction in magnitude of a small peak at @xmath129 gev and for large missing momenta , @xmath130 gev . for the asymmetries that require a polarized beam ,",
    "the influence of the double spin - flip terms is smaller .",
    "there are no huge modifications , and the largest corrections appear for the peak structures around @xmath129 gev , and for very large missing momenta .",
    "this figure gives the impression that an additional polarization , i.e. the beam polarization , may play a similar role as an additional spin - dependence in the fsi , and that at least one of them - either a spin - dependent fsi or a polarized beam - needs to be present to generate an approximately correct ejectile polarization asymmetry .",
    "once the beam is polarized , it seems that introducing the additional double spin - flip terms does not really change the results too much .",
    "a very similar picture emerges for @xmath121 , away from the quasi - elastic peak .",

    "we have used a parametrization of experimental @xmath2 data from said to describe the full @xmath125 scattering amplitude for the final state interaction .",

    "the asymmetries accessible with an unpolarized beam are zero in pwia .",
    "the influence of the fsis is very large for all six asymmetries .",
    "for the three asymmetries where the pwia results are non - zero , the fsis seem to reduce the asymmetries in general , although increases in asymmetries can also be observed for specific kinematics .",
    "we have investigated the role played by off - shell fsis , and they turn out to be fairly small in most situations , with the exception of @xmath117 .",
    "this is interesting , as the contributions from off - shell fsis in unpolarized deuteron scattering and for a polarized target were occasionally quite significant . in practice , it is good news that the off - shell fsis are small , as any remaining theoretical uncertainty is connected to these terms .",

    "currently , there are no @xmath133 data at high @xmath8 available , but an experiment could easily be performed at jefferson lab . in view of the high sensitivity to double spin - flip terms , we feel that one of the most interesting measurements would be to take data for @xmath112 for @xmath121 , or even for @xmath116 . besides this , measuring ejectile polarization asymmetries for kinematics where unpolarized data or target polarization data are available would allow one to perform a systematic investigation of the reaction mechanism .",
