    "characteristic feature of fractal sets is known to be the self - similarity : if one takes a part of the whole set , it looks like the original set after a deformation @xmath2 .",
    "formal basis of the self - similarity is the power - law function @xmath3 with a hurst exponent @xmath4 ( for time series , value @xmath5 is reduced to the fluctuation amplitude and @xmath6 is the interval size within which this amplitude is determined ) .",
    "while the simple case of monofractal is characterized by a single exponent @xmath4 , a multifractal system is described by a continuous spectrum of exponents ( singularity spectrum ) @xmath7 @xcite . along this way",
    ", a self - similarity degree @xmath8 represents the exponent of a homogeneous function being characteristic function of self - similar systems @xcite ( so , within nonextensive thermostatistics , this exponent expresses the escort probability @xmath9 throughout the original one @xmath10 @xcite ) . in physical applications , a central role",
    "is played by the partition function @xmath11 ( @xmath12 is a characteristic size of boxes covering multifractal ) to be determined by the mass exponent @xmath13 connected with the generalized hurst exponent @xmath7 by the relation @xmath14 .",
    "since fractals are scale invariant sets , it is natural to apply the quantum calculus to description of multifractals because quantum analysis is based on the jackson derivative which yields variation of a function with respect to the deformation of its argument @xcite .",
    "this letter is devoted to such a description with using deformed series of expansions of the partition function , the mass exponent and the averages of random variables over deformed powers of the difference @xmath0 . as shows the consideration in section [ sec.2 ] , the coefficients of the partition function expansion",
    "are reduced to binomial - type combinations of the tsallis entropies related to manifold deformations @xmath15 with growing powers @xmath16 respectively , section [ sec.3 ] shows that escort probability is generated by the mass exponent whose expansion into deformed power series represents the generalization of well - known relation @xmath1 with fractal dimension spectra @xmath17 corresponding to manifold deformations .",
    "according to section [ sec.4 ] , above expansion permits also to expresses physical averages over the escort probability @xmath18 in terms of related averages based on the ordinary one @xmath10 .",
    "section [ sec.5 ] contains discussion of results obtained , and in appendix we adduce necessary information from the quantum calculus .",
    "following the standard scheme @xcite , we consider a multifractal set covered by boxes @xmath19 with number @xmath20 .",
    "the peculiarity of self - similar sets is that the probability to occupy a box @xmath21 is determined by its size @xmath22 according to the power - law relation @xmath23 characterized by a hlder exponent @xmath24 .",
    "all properties of a multifractal is known to be determined by the partition function @xmath25 which according to the normalization condition takes the value @xmath26 at @xmath27 . because @xmath28 for all boxes @xmath21 , the function ( [ z ] ) decreases monotonically from maximum magnitude @xmath29 related to @xmath30 . in the simplest case of the flat distribution @xmath31 fixed by the statistical weight @xmath32",
    ", one has the exponential decay @xmath33 .",
    "our approach is based on the expansion of the partition function ( [ z ] ) into the deformed series ( [ 7 ] ) in powers of the difference @xmath0 @xcite @xmath34_\\lambda!}(q-1)_\\lambda^{(n)}.   \\label{z1}\\ ] ] here , the deformed powers @xmath35 are determined by the binomial ( [ 8 ] ) , while the kernels @xmath36 are defined by the @xmath37-fold action of the jackson derivative : @xmath38 by using the method of induction with accounting the definitions ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ z ] ) , one obtains the explicit expression @xmath39 where @xmath40 are binomial coefficients . in absence of deformation @xmath41 , all coefficients ( [ kernel ] ) equal zero , apart from the single term @xmath42 .",
    "inserting these coefficients into the series ( [ z1 ] ) gives @xmath43 as desired .",
    "it is easily to see that the set of kernels ( [ kernel ] ) with @xmath44 is expressed in terms of the tsallis entropy @xcite @xmath45 with growth of the deformation parameter @xmath6 , this entropy decreases monotonically with inflection in the point @xmath46 where the expression ( [ s ] ) takes the boltzmann - gibbs form @xmath47 . in the case",
    "@xmath48 , the coefficient ( [ kernel ] ) does not depend on the deformation parameter @xmath6 to give the value @xmath49 . at @xmath50 ,",
    "one obtains @xcite @xmath51 respectively , in the second order @xmath52 , eq.([kernel ] ) yields @xmath53 with accounting the definition ( [ s ] ) one has @xmath54 in arbitrary order @xmath37 , combination of equations ( [ kernel ] ) and ( [ s ] ) arrives at the sum @xmath55 which expresses in explicit form a generalized entropy of a multifractal by means of contributions of the tsallis entropies related to different powers of the set deformation . in the limit @xmath56 , when @xmath57 , accounting of all terms in the sum over @xmath58 arrives at cancellation of the denominator @xmath59 so that @xmath60 ; similarly , at @xmath61 , one obtains the boltzmann - gibbs limit @xmath62 as desired . finally , in the case @xmath63 , where @xmath64 , the term related to @xmath65 is reduced to zero so that main contribution gives the term with @xmath66 to arrive at the sign - changing asymptotics @xmath67 .",

    "following pseudo - thermodynamic picture of multifractal sets @xcite , let us define effective values of the free energy @xmath75 , the internal energy @xmath76 and the entropy @xmath77 : @xmath78 here , @xmath79 is the size of characteristic box in phase space , @xmath10 and @xmath18 are original and escort probabilities to be connected with the definition @xmath80 inserting this equation into the second expression ( [ fa ] ) , one obtains the well - known legendre transformation @xcite @xmath81 where @xmath8 plays the role of the inverse temperature and the internal energy is specified with the state equation @xmath82    it is easily to convince the escort probability ( [ prob ] ) is generated by the characteristic function being the mass exponent @xmath83 really , one has @xmath84 by analogy with eq.([z1 ] ) , one can expand the function ( [ tau ] ) into the deformed series @xmath85_\\lambda!}(q-1)_\\lambda^{(n ) }   \\label{tau1}\\ ] ] being the generalization of the known relation @xmath1 connecting the mass exponent @xmath75 with the multifractal dimension spectrum @xmath17 @xcite . similarly to the equations ( [ z2 ] ) and ( [ kernel ] ) , the kernel @xmath86 is determined by the @xmath37-fold action of the jackson derivative : @xmath87 noteworthy , the term with @xmath48 is absent in the series ( [ tau1 ] ) . at @xmath50 , one reproduces the ordinary relation @xmath88 , while the kernels @xmath86 with @xmath89 include terms being proportional to @xmath90 to correspond to manifold deformations @xmath15 , @xmath91 .",
    "generally , the definition ( [ dd ] ) yields a hierarchy of the multifractal dimension spectra related to different multiplication factors @xmath37 of the set deformation .    in trivial case of the flat distribution )",
    "is not applicable in this case because fixation of the statistical weight @xmath92 makes impossible variation of the probability @xmath31 .",
    "] , when the partition function is @xmath68 , the definition ( [ tau ] ) yields the mass exponent @xmath93 with the fractal dimension @xmath94 which tends to @xmath95 when the size of covering boxes @xmath12 goes to the inverse statistical weight @xmath96 .",
    "thus , we can conclude the flat distribution relates to a monofractal with dimension @xmath97 tending to a smooth one - dimensional set at deformation @xmath98 .",
    "let us consider an observable @xmath99 distributed over a multifracal set . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , its mean value @xmath100 is determined by the escort probability ( [ prob ] ) . with accounting eqs .",
    "( [ p ] )  ( [ dd ] ) , the average ( [ o ] ) can be expressed in terms of the sum @xmath101_\\lambda!}\\frac{(q-1)_\\lambda^{(n)}}{(\\lambda-1)^{n } } \\sum\\limits_{m=0}^n(-1)^{n - m}{n\\choose m}\\lambda^m\\left<\\phi\\right>_{\\lambda^m}\\ ] ] where the specific average @xmath102 is introduced . at @xmath65 ,",
    "the escort distribution @xmath103 is reduced to the original one @xmath10 so that related terms in the sum ( [ oo ] ) are proportional to the ordinary average @xmath104 . on the other hand , in absence of deformation @xmath41 , the only term with @xmath48 determines the mean value ( [ o ] ) : @xmath105 . in the limit @xmath56 , the escort probability reduced to flat distribution @xmath106 for arbitrary form of the ordinary distribution so that average ( [ o ] ) is determined by the simple expression @xmath107 .",
    "finally , in the case @xmath63 , main contribution is given by the terms with @xmath65 and @xmath66 so that the average ( [ oo ] ) takes the form @xmath108",
    "a principle peculiarity of above consideration is that the expansions ( [ z1 ] ) , ( [ tau1 ] ) and ( [ oo ] ) depend of both deformation parameter @xmath6 and self - similarity degree @xmath8 . as shows the example of using the flat distribution in the end of section [ sec.3 ] , the former determines the fractal dimension @xmath97 in the simple case of the monofractal generated by deformation @xmath72 of initial cell of size @xmath79 .",
    "with passage to general case of multifractal , we obtain the fractal dimension spectrum defined by the series ( [ dd ] ) . along this line , the self - similarity degree @xmath8 plays the role of a free parameter whose variation describes the multifractal spectrum , while value of the deformation parameter @xmath6 fixes the scale of the multifractal resolution to be determined by external conditions in the case of natural objects .",
    "as pointed out in introduction , our study is based on the jackson derivative ( [ 1 ] ) which gives variation of a function with respect to scale choice of its argument .",
    "this derivative expresses the coefficients of the deformed taylor expansion ( [ 7 ] ) in powers of the deformed difference @xmath0 defined by the binomial ( [ 8 ] ) . in this way",

    "multifractal characteristics vary in the following manner .",
    "the generalized entropies ( [ k ] ) tend to the statistical weight @xmath92 in the limit @xmath56 , take the boltzmann - gibbs magnitude @xmath109 at @xmath46 and arrive at the sign - changing asymptotics @xmath67 when @xmath63 .",
    "what about the relation ( [ oo ] ) between the physical average @xmath110 and the ordinary one @xmath111 , one has the simple expression @xmath107 in the limit @xmath56 , the trivial relation @xmath105 in absence of deformation @xmath41 , and the difference @xmath112 being proportional to the factor @xmath0 at @xmath63 .    from physical point of view",
    ", the most tractable is the expansion of the mass exponent ( [ tau1 ] ) whose coefficients represent fractal dimension spectra . as shows the equality ( [ dd ] ) , the fractal dimensions @xmath113 related to different powers @xmath37 of the series ( [ tau1 ] ) can change their signs with variation of the deformation @xmath6 .",
    "because , within the pseudo - thermodynamic formalism , the mass exponent @xmath114 and the self - similarity degree @xmath8 relate to the free energy and the inverse temperature respectively , such a change means that thermodynamic potential can obtain a singularity at some deformations @xmath6 . within framework of the physical presentation @xcite",
