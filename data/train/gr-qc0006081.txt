    "the physical basis of a new algorithm for the evolution of spacetimes has been proposed .",

    "the intimate use of characteristics has particular advantages for the description of gravitational radiation and black hole formation .",
    "the first attempt to carry out numerical evolution based upon this algorithm was only successful in a region outside some sufficiently large worldtube .",

    "it was found that near the vertex of the cone the courant - friedrichs - lewy ( cfl ) condition places a stricter limit on the time step than for the case of cauchy evolution .",
    "this insight made possible the development of an extremely efficient marching algorithm for evolving the data on the initial cone by stepping it out from the vertex of the next cone to null infinity ( scri ) along each angular ray direction .",
    "this marching algorithm is based upon a simple identity satisfied by the values of the scalar field at the corners of a parallelogram formed by four null rays .",
    "the result was a stable , calibrated , second order accurate global algorithm on a compactified grid .",
    "furthermore , scri played the role of a perfect absorbing boundary so that no radiation was reflected back into the system .",

    "the cfl condition on the numerical domain of dependence is a necessary condition for convergence of a numerical algorithm . for the grid point at @xmath56 , there are three critical grid points , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , which must lie inside its past physical light cone .",

    "the linearized gravitational evolution equation ( [ eq : lgammaev ] ) can be recast into a form similar to ( [ eq : sbox ] ) , @xmath67 where now @xmath68 and @xmath69 only contains hypersurface terms .",
    "this allows use of the null parallelogram algorithm to evolve @xmath5 by the same marching scheme as in the scalar case .",
    "the additional feature here is that @xmath17 must be simultaneously marched out the null cone using the hypersurface equation ( [ eq : lu ] ) .",
    "for the scalar wave equation ( [ eq : sbox ] ) , the angular momentum barrier is represented by the term @xmath70 , which is determined from @xmath52 by a double angular derivative . in the linearized gravitational evolution equation ( [ eq : lgammaev ] )",

    "this reduces equation ( [ eq : np ] ) to @xmath172 using the expansion ( [ eq : u - zero ] ) for @xmath17 near the origin , the integral simplifies further to @xmath173 the integrand is now evaluated to second order accuracy at @xmath174 using @xmath175 and @xmath176 .",
    "keeping higher order terms would not improve the global convergence rate of the code .",
    "as we have shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : linear ] , linearized solutions of the bondi equations can be generated by solutions of the scalar wave equation , thus supplying a complete set of test beds for the very weak regime .",
    "for the nonlinear case , exact boost and rotation symmetric solutions  @xcite of the bondi initial hypersurface equations have also been found  @xcite .",
    "they have been used to check the radial integrations leading from @xmath5 to @xmath89 , @xmath17 and @xmath90 but they do not provide a test of the evolution algorithm . however , in the course of this work , we have found that one of these initial data sets is in fact preserved under time evolution and is an exact static solution of the nonlinear vacuum equations .",
    "this solution provides an important test bed for null cone evolution codes . except for spherically symmetric cases , it is the only known solution of einstein s equation which can be expressed explicitly in null cone coordinates with no singularity at the vertex .",
    "it has the form @xmath177 where @xmath178 , @xmath179 and @xmath144 is a free scale parameter .",
    "it is remarkable that the null data @xmath5 is time independent under evolution , as can be verified by inserting the above expressions in ( [ eq : gammaev ] ) .",
    "because this solution is static , as well as boost and rotation symmetric , the commutator between the boost and time translation symmetries implies that it has an additional translation symmetry in the boost direction .",
    "thus the solution falls into several overlapping and widely studied classes , including the static cylindrically symmetric spacetimes and the weyl static axisymmetric spacetimes .",
    "however , this solution , which we call simple , has not previously been singled out , apparently because it can not easily be identified in the traditional coordinates used for studying static solutions . because of its cylindrical symmetry , it is clear that this solution is not asymptotically flat but it can be used to construct an asymptotically flat , nonsingular solution by smoothly pasting asymptotically flat null data to it outside some radius @xmath46 .",
    "the resulting solution will be static and given by ( [ eq : simple ] ) in the domain of dependence interior to @xmath46 .",
    "numerical solutions generated by this technique are used in the code calibration tests presented below .",
    "in addition , global energy conservation provides an important test bed .",
    "the bondi mass loss formula is not one of the equations used in the evolution algorithm but follows from those equations as a consequence of a global integration of the bianchi identities .",
    "we have tested the algorithm to be second order accurate and stable , subject to the cfl condition , throughout the regime in which caustics and horizons do not form . in sec .",
    "[ sec : linear ] , we showed how the the linearized bondi equations may be reduced to the scalar wave equation by local operations .",
    "for very weak data , the nonlinear equations approximate the linear equations so that we would expect the global stability of the nonlinear algorithm to be related to the cfl condition for the scalar wave algorithm . near the origin",
    ", stability checks show that the time step is limited by ( [ eq : cfl ] ) with @xmath180 , which is twice the limit found for the scalar wave algorithm .",
    "this factor of two apparently arises from the use of a staggered grid in the gravitational case , which effectively doubles the value of @xmath61 at which the main algorithm takes over from the start up algorithm at the origin .",
    "this gives some reassurance that the scalar wave algorithm has been optimally adapted to the bondi equations .    by construction , the @xmath95-direction is timelike at the origin where it coincides with the worldline traced out by the vertex of the outgoing null cone .",
    "but even for weak fields , the @xmath95-direction becomes spacelike at large distances along a typical outgoing ray .",
    "this can be seen from the metric coefficient @xmath181 which at large @xmath61 becomes dominated by the the asymptotic behavior @xmath182 .",
    "geometrically , this reflects the property that scri is itself a null hypersurface so that all internal directions are spacelike , except for the null generator . for a flat space time , the @xmath95-direction picked out at the origin corresponds to the null direction at scri but it becomes asymptotically spacelike under the slightest deviation from spherical symmetry .    by choosing initial data of very small amplitude ( @xmath183 ) ,",
    "we have performed convergence tests of the numerical solutions against the solutions of the linearized equations .",
    "the linearized solutions ( [ eq : ltest ] ) were given as initial data at @xmath78 and we compared the numerically evolved solutions to the linearized solutions at a central time of @xmath184 .",
    "we observed that for the low angular momentum solutions ( @xmath1852 , 3 , 4 ) the code is superaccurate , i.e. the solutions converge to the exact result at a rate faster than second order in the grid size .",
    "this is to be expected since for these solutions the hatted variables used in the code exhibit angular dependence that is at most quadratic in @xmath113 , so that the second order accurate @xmath113-derivatives are calculated exactly .",
    "the error , as measured by the @xmath186 norm , of a numerical solution with higher harmonics ( @xmath187 ) is graphed in fig .  [",
    "fig : l6 ] .",
    "the slope of the graph gives a convergence rate of @xmath188 with respect to grid size .",
    "this result is insensitive to the particular norm used , i.e. we also verified second order convergence in the @xmath189 and @xmath190 norms .",
    "second order convergence has also been checked against the exact static solution simple . since",
    "this solution is not asymptotically flat , we match the initial data smoothly to asymptotically flat data for a nonstatic exterior .",
    "consideration of the domain of dependence implies that the matching boundary propagates along an ingoing null hypersurface .",
    "thus , we can obtain a reliable measure of how accurately the evolution preserves the static interior , provided we restrict the calculation of the error norm to a region not yet influenced by the exterior nonstatic data .",
    "we matched one such static solution in the interior ( @xmath191 ) to smooth exterior data with compact support .",
    "we calculated the @xmath190 norm for the region @xmath192 at time u=0.25 , and considered the dependence of the error on the grid size .",
    "the preservation of the static interior to graphical accuracy is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : simple ] , while the second order convergence of the error is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : convergence ] .",
    "in addition , for a wide variety of initial data having unknown analytic solution , we have verified that the numerical solution converges to second order in the sense of cauchy convergence .",
    "stability of the code in the low to medium amplitude regime has been verified experimentally by running arbitrary initial data until it radiates away to scri . at higher amplitudes , it is expected that physical singularities will arise , but we have not yet explored this regime .",
    "figure  [ fig : seq ] shows a sequence of time slices of the numerical evolution of some arbitrary initial data of compact support .",
    "note the rich angular structure that arises at @xmath193 and then dissipates . at @xmath194",
    "the amplitude of the field is sufficiently small so that it appears to be zero in the figure .",
    "it continues to decay at later times .",
    "the bondi mass loss formula relates the gravitational radiation power to the square of the news function .",
    "it follows from the equations used in the algorithm as a consequence of a global integration of the bianchi identities .",
    "thus it not only furnishes a valuable tool for physical interpretation but it also provides a very important calibration of numerical accuracy and consistency .    historically , numerical calculations of the bondi mass @xmath195 have been frustrated by technical difficulties arising from the necessity to pick off nonleading terms in an asymptotic expansion about infinity .",
    "for example , the mass aspect @xmath92 must be picked off in the the asymptotic expansion ( [ eq : vasym ] ) for @xmath90 .",
    "this is similar to the experimental task of determining the mass of an object by measuring its far field . in the non - radiative case",
    "it can be accomplished by measuring gravity gradients , but otherwise this approach can be swamped by radiation fields . in the computational problem , further complications arise from gauge terms which dominate asymptotically even over the radiation terms .",
    "we have recently developed a second order accurate algorithm for calculating the bondi mass  @xcite .",
    "it avoids the above problems through the use of penrose compactification and the introduction of renormalized variables in which bondi s mass aspect appears as the leading asymptotic term .",
    "the bondi mass algorithm depends only upon fields on a single null hypersurface .",
    "it has been incorporated into the present evolution code to calculate the mass at any given retarded time .    in the present formalism , the news function @xmath196 is given by  @xcite @xmath197 _",

    "calculation of @xmath198 complicates the calculation of the news function .",
    "the simplest approach is to set @xmath103 and @xmath202 .",
    "then @xmath203 where @xmath204 .",
    "\\label{eq : yb}\\ ] ] this gives @xmath205 where @xmath206 in order to prepare this integral in an explicitly regular form for computation we introduce an auxiliary parameter @xmath20 and rewrite ( [ eq : delta ] ) as the double integral @xmath207 where @xmath208 is regular at the poles .",
    "it is then straightforward to obtain a second order accurate finite difference formula for the news function .",
    "the bondi formula for energy conservation between central times @xmath49 and @xmath95 takes the form @xmath209 = 0 , where @xmath210 figure  [ fig : masscons ] graphs @xmath209 relative to the initial mass @xmath211 for a numerical evolution of the polynomial data @xmath212 ^ 6 \\over { \\left [ ( x_1 - x_2 ) y_0 \\right]^{12 } } } \\label{eq : compact}\\ ] ] with compact support in the domain @xmath213 and amplitude parameter @xmath214 . for the graph ,",
    "we have chosen @xmath215 , @xmath216 , @xmath217 and @xmath218 , and evolved the numerical solution up to @xmath219 , on a grid of 512 radial @xmath220 128 angular points .",
    "the bulk of the error occurs in the calculation of the bondi mass , whose accuracy is more sensitive to grid size than the accuracy of either the news function or the evolution code .",
    "most of this error may be removed by using richardson extrapolation to take advantage of the known second order accuracy of the bondi mass .",
    "for example , if @xmath221 is a second order accurate finite difference approximation to the function @xmath222 on a grid of @xmath223 points , then @xmath224 approximates @xmath225 to third order and in fact to fourth order if odd orders are absent in the approximation .",
    "this absence of odd orders indeed holds for the bondi mass because all derivatives , interpolations and integrals are centered .",
    "thus , introduction of subgrids obtained by subsampling , leads to a fourth order expression for @xmath195 , with the corresponding relative error in energy conservation also graphed in fig .",
    "[ fig : masscons ] . in this way ,",
    "energy conservation is attained to 0.4% accuracy .",
    "note that only a single evolution on a fixed grid is necessary here because richardson extrapolation is applied when calculating the bondi mass .",
    "for the purposes of the graph , we have done this for each time that @xmath209 is plotted , but to check energy conservation , it suffices to do it only at the initial and final times .",
    "figure  [ fig : masscons ] serves as a rewarding testament to the virtues of a code with known convergence rates .",
    "we have constructed a second order accurate evolution algorithm for the null cone initial value problem for axisymmetric vacuum spacetimes .",
    "energy conservation is maintained to second order accuracy .",
    "extensive tests of the algorithm establish that it is globally valid in the regime where horizons and caustics do not develop .",
    "this generates a large complement of highly accurate numerical solutions for the class of asymptotically flat , axisymmetric vacuum spacetimes , for which no analytic solutions are known .",
    "all results of numerical evolutions in this regime are consistent with the theorem of christodoulou and klainerman  @xcite that weak initial data evolve asymptotically to minkowski space at late time .",
    "the code is now being tested in the strong field regime for application to the study of black hole formation .",
    "we sketch here the von neumann stability analysis of the algorithm for the linearized bondi equations .",
    "the analysis is based up freezing the explicit functions of @xmath61 and @xmath113 that appear in the equations , so that it is only valid locally for grid sizes satisfying @xmath226 and @xmath227",
    ". however , as is usually the case , the results are quite indicative of the stability of the actual global behavior of the code .    starting with the hatted code variables introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec : fde ] and setting @xmath228 and @xmath229 , the linearized bondi equations ( [ eq : lu ] ) and ( [ eq : lgammaev ] ) take the form @xmath230(rg_{,r}-g )    \\label{eq : gamma}\\ ] ] and @xmath231 freezing the explicit factors of @xmath61 and @xmath113 at @xmath232 and @xmath233 , introducing the fourier modes @xmath234 ( with real @xmath235 and @xmath236 ) and setting @xmath237 , these equations imply @xmath238/(2+r^2 k^2)\\ ] ] and @xmath239 for stable modes , @xmath240 .",

    "unstable solutions exist to the pde s obtained by freezing the coefficients in the linearized equations ( [ eq : gamma ] ) and ( [ eq : bigg ] ) .",
    "the linearized equations themselves do not have unstable modes but they arise in the frozen coefficient formalism from dropping the boundary condition of spherical topology on the @xmath113-dependence . for a global solution , @xmath243 should not have periodic dependence on @xmath113 but instead be decomposed into spin - weight 2 harmonics , in which case instabilities would not arise in the above analysis .",
    "thus these unstable modes of the frozen pde are artificial and should be discarded by requiring @xmath244 when analyzing the stability of the corresponding fde .",
    "consider now the fde obtained by putting @xmath243 on the grid points @xmath245 and @xmath246 on the staggered points @xmath247 , while using the same angular grid @xmath248 and time grid @xmath249 .",
