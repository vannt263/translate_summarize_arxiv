    "@xmath1 of a finitely generated group counts the number of conjugacy classes in the ball of radius @xmath2 .",
    "this function has recently been studied by several authors for many important classes of groups ( see the survey  @xcite and also  @xcite , @xcite ) with the goal of determining whether it is polynomial or exponential , or to establish uniform conjugacy growth .",
    "primitive conjugacy growth , the one that counts the number of conjugacy classes of primitive elements ( a primitive element is one which is not a proper power of another element ) has been studied for many decades , motivated by counting closed geodesics ( up to free homotopy ) on complete riemannian manifolds ; for example , margulis @xcite proved that for a compact manifold @xmath3 of pinched negative curvature and exponential volume growth @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the entropy of @xmath3 , the number of primitive closed geodesics of period @xmath6 is approximately @xmath7 .",
    "this formula gives , via quasi - isometry , good estimates for the number of primitive conjugacy classes in the fundamental group of @xmath3 .",
    "the previously mentioned results study conjugacy growth from the asymptotic point of view . in this paper",
    "we study formal conjugacy growth , that is , the formal power series @xmath8.\\ ] ] notice that when studying formal growth , the algebraic complexity of function ( i.e. rational , algebraic or transcendental over @xmath9 ) might depend on the choice of the generating set . throughout the paper",
    ", we will assume that the generating sets generate the group as a monoid . in order to avoid working with non - symmetric metrics on cayley graphs",
    ", we will also assume that the generating sets are inverse closed , although this last condition is not essential .    to our knowledge , rivin ( @xcite and @xcite ) was the first to study formal conjugacy growth for groups .",
    "he computed @xmath10 for non - abelian free groups with respect to the standard basis and showed that it is not rational ( see section [ sec : series ] for a definition ) .",
    "ciobanu and hermiller  @xcite obtained similar results for free products of finite groups different from @xmath11 .",
    "rivin , based on his computations , made the following conjecture .",

    "the conjugacy growth series @xmath10 is rational if and only if @xmath12 is virtually cyclic",
    ".    in @xcite , ciobanu , hermiller , holt and rees proved one direction of rivin s conjecture , namely that virtually cyclic groups have rational conjugacy growth series for any generating set .",
    "in this paper we complete the proof of rivin s conjecture and give natural generalizations to primitive conjugacy growth and commensurability growth .",
    "as mentioned before , from the geometric point of view it is natural to study the primitive conjugacy growth @xmath13 , i.e. the number of conjugacy classes of primitive elements of length at most @xmath2 . from the algebraic point of view , on the other hand , when the group has torsion it is more suitable to study commensurability classes .",
    "recall that two elements @xmath14 and @xmath15 of a group @xmath12 are _ commensurated _ if there are @xmath16 and @xmath17 such that @xmath18 .",
    "commensurability classes in acylindrically hyperbolic groups were used in @xcite to decide if certain endomorphisms were inner automorphisms .",
    "thus the number of commensurability classes @xmath19 in the ball of radius @xmath2 can be relevant for algorithms .",
    "let @xmath20 and @xmath21 denote the growth series associated to @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively .",

    "[ thm : rivinconj ] let @xmath12 be a hyperbolic group",

    "a hyperbolic group is called _ elementary _ if it is virtually cyclic .",
    "coornaert and knieper ( @xcite , @xcite ) generalized the results of margulis to the context of hyperbolic groups , and provided bounds ( the upper bound only in the torsion - free case ) for the growth function of conjugacy classes and primitive conjugacy classes in terms of the _ exponential growth rate _",
    "@xmath5 of @xmath12 with respect to the generating set @xmath26 , where @xmath27{|{\\mathbb{b}}_x(n)|}$ ] and @xmath28 is the ball of radius @xmath2 . in this paper",
    "we extend the results of coornaert and knieper to all conjugacy classes and all commensurability classes , and we prove    [ thm : cgrate ] let @xmath12 be a non - elementary word hyperbolic group and @xmath26 any finite symmetric generating set .",

    "the exponential growth rate @xmath5 of @xmath12 and the exponential growth rates of @xmath25 , @xmath23 and @xmath22 are equal .",
    "the proof of theorem [ thm : cgrate ] requires two key ingredients : the first is patterson - sullivan theory , which is used to obtain bounds for the growth of hyperbolic groups ; the second is the fact that in hyperbolic groups `` conjugacy @xmath35 cyclic permutation '' , i.e. two elements are conjugate if and only if some of their cyclic permutations are conjugated by an element of universally bounded length .",
    "our second main result concerns the rivin conjecture for _ acylindrically hyperbolic groups _ , that is , groups acting non - elementary and acylindrically by isometries on a hyperbolic space ( more details in section [ sec : ah ] ) .",
    "the class of acylindrically hyperbolic groups contains non - elementary hyperbolic and relatively hyperbolic groups , all but finitely many mapping class groups of punctured closed surfaces , @xmath36 for @xmath37 , directly indecomposable right - angled artin groups , 1-relator groups with at least 3 generators , most 3-manifold groups , @xmath38 small cancellation groups and many other examples ( see @xcite ) .    based on our results we propose the following natural extension of rivin s conjecture .",
    "let @xmath12 be a finitely generated acylindrically hyperbolic group .",
    "then @xmath10 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are transcendental .",
    "the action of acylindrically hyperbolic groups on hyperbolic spaces is typically neither proper , nor co - compact ; hence it is not clear how to define patterson - sullivan measures on the boundary ( recently , @xcite has made progress in the case of relatively hyperbolic groups ) .",
    "therefore a result like theorem [ thm : cgrate ] for finitely generated acylindrically hyperbolic groups seems out of reach with the current techniques .",
    "this is why we approach the above conjecture from the point of view of formal languages .",
    "recall that _ a language _",
    "@xmath39 is a set of words over some finite _ alphabet _ @xmath40 , that is , @xmath39 is a subset of @xmath41 , the free monoid generated by @xmath40 .",
    "languages have been categorized into several classes according to their complexity , the simplest ones being regular and context - free , with the class of unambiguous context - free languages strictly containing all regular languages and being contained in the set of all context - free ones . for these low - level languages",
    "we can match the computational complexity with an algebraic characterization as follows : the growth series of a regular language is rational , and the growth series of an unambiguous context - free language ( the definition is not necessary in this paper , see @xcite for details ) is algebraic .",
    "[ thm : chomskys ] if @xmath42 is unambiguous context - free , then @xmath43 $ ] is algebraic over @xmath9 .",
    "chomsky - schtzemberger s theorem would imply , if the strengthened rivin s conjecture were confirmed , that no language of minimal length conjugacy / conjugacy primitive / commensurability representatives can be unambiguous context - free .",
    "this is exactly our second main result .",
    "[ thm : ahregular ] let @xmath12 be a finitely generated acylindrically hyperbolic group , @xmath26 any finite symmetric generating set , and @xmath44 a subset of @xmath45 containing exactly one minimal length representative of each conjugacy / primitive conjugacy / commensurability class . then @xmath44 is not unambiguous context - free .",
    "in particular , such a language can not be regular .",
    "the proof of theorem [ thm : ahregular ] combines closure properties of formal languages , which will be discussed in section [ sec : languages ] , together with the  conjugacy @xmath35 cyclic permutation \" phenomenon for conjugacy classes of hyperbolically embedded subgroups ( theorem [ thm : poison ] ) proved in section [ sec : ah ] .",
    "we say that a formal power series @xmath46 $ ] is _ rational _ if there exist nonzero polynomials @xmath47 $ ] such that @xmath48 ; more generally , @xmath49 is _ algebraic _ over @xmath9 if there exists a nontrivial polynomial @xmath50 such that @xmath51 if @xmath49 is not algebraic over @xmath9 , we say that @xmath49 is _ transcendental _ over @xmath9 .",
    "any language @xmath39 over @xmath26 gives rise to a _ strict growth function _",
    "@xmath52 defined by @xmath53 and a _ cumulative growth function _",
    "@xmath54 defined by @xmath55 these , in turn , give rise to the strict growth series @xmath56 and cumulative growth series @xmath57 of the language @xmath39 . in the introduction ,",
    "theorem [ thm : chomskys ] is stated for the cumulative growth series of the language , while in the literature such results may be stated for the strict growth series .",
    "we observe that these two formulations are equivalent , since from the relation @xmath58 the strict growth series is rational ( algebraic ) if and only if the cumulative growth series is rational ( algebraic ) .",
    "we now deduce theorem [ thm : rivinconj ] from theorem [ thm : cgrate ] .",
    "our proof relies on the lemma below , which describes the asymptotics of the coefficients of an algebraic growth series .",
    "[ lem : algebraic_coefficients ]    if @xmath59 is the series expansion of an algebraic function that is analytic at the origin , then there exist algebraic numbers @xmath60 and @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is some positive integer , and a positive algebraic number @xmath65 such that @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "first observe that if @xmath12 is virtually cyclic , the result for @xmath10 was proved in ( * ? ? ? * theorem 4.2 ) , and @xmath20 and @xmath21 are polynomials , as in a virtually cyclic group there are finitely many primitive conjugacy classes and commensurability classes .",
    "so , assume that @xmath12 is not virtually cyclic and let @xmath69 or @xmath70 or @xmath71 . by theorem [ thm : cgrate ] the sequence @xmath72 satisfies @xmath73 for @xmath74 . by the root criterion for convergence , @xmath75 converges for @xmath76 and therefore is analytic at the origin .",
    "suppose moreover that @xmath75 is an algebraic function ; then by lemma [ lem : algebraic_coefficients ] we can assume that @xmath72 has the form ( [ alg ] ) .    since @xmath73 for @xmath74 , we have that @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "thus by lemma [ lem : algebraic_coefficients ] the growth series @xmath79 can not be algebraic , so it is transcendental over @xmath24 .",
    "[ rem : quasicommgrowth ] the proof above , together with the assumption that @xmath13 satisfies the inequalities in theorem [ thm : cgrate ] , shows that if there is a constant @xmath80 and a function @xmath81 such that @xmath82 for all @xmath2 greater than some @xmath30 , then @xmath83 is transcendental over @xmath9 .",
