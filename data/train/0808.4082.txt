    "his characterization of split orders is entirely algebraic , characterizing them as either maximal orders or the intersection of two uniquely determined maximal orders .",

    "hijikata s proposition has the following geometric interpretation .",
    "for @xmath2 a local field , the vertices of the affine building associated to @xmath7 are in one - to - one correspondence with the maximal orders in @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , it is well - known that @xmath17-building is actually a @xmath18-regular tree ( @xmath19 the cardinality of the residue field of @xmath2 ) , so that any two vertices determines a unique path or geodesic between them .",
    "thus split orders are in one - to - one correspondence with the geodesics of finite ( nonnegative ) length on the tree , with the split order realized as the intersection of the maximal orders representing the endpoints of the geodesic ; geodesics of length zero are the maximal orders .",
    "in this paper we consider the generalization of the notion of a split order to @xmath20 for @xmath21 , and give a geometric characterization using the affine building for @xmath5 .",
    "we take as a definition of a split order , an order in @xmath3 which contains a subring @xmath22-conjugate to @xmath23 , hereafter denoted as @xmath24 . the geometric generalization which we derive agrees with the @xmath6 characterization , though in a manner slightly more nuanced than the one given above . in generalizing",
    ", one finds that there is no comparable uniqueness statement ( as in hijikata s proposition ) which characterizes a split order as the intersection of a uniquely determined minimal set of maximal orders .",
    "rather , the uniqueness arises by considering the set of all maximal orders which contain the split order .",
    "we show that    there is an apartment which contains the set of all maximal orders containing a given split order ,    this collection of maximal orders consists of the set of all vertices which lie in a convex polytope uniquely determined by the split order , and    the split order is the intersection of all the maximal orders in this convex polytope .    in the case @xmath6 ( where the building is a tree ) , hijikata s result shows that a split order is the intersection of the maximal orders which are the endpoints of the geodesic which characterize it ; from this work it follows that the split order is also the intersection of all the maximal orders contained in the geodesic . for @xmath21 and in the case where all the maximal orders are vertices of a single chamber in the building ,",
    "the notion of split orders reduces to that of chain orders studied ( to a different end ) in @xcite . in that case",
    "the notion of convexity is implicit in the structure of the building as the convex polytopes which arise are simply faces of the chamber .",
    "the present work addresses finitely many maximal orders chosen arbitrarily in any apartment of the building .",
    "the fact that there is a given apartment containing all the maximal orders which contain a split order is an interesting extension of the standard building fact that any two simplicies in a building are contained in a single apartment , and may point to more complicated structure implicit in the building .",

    "naive conjectures concerning a minimal set of maximal orders whose intersection produces the split order are easily shown not to hold in general , however a uniqueness statement can be deduced characterizing split orders as the intersection of a geometrically distinguished collection of maximal orders which nicely generalizes the situation for @xmath6 .",

    "requires a bit of background which we present here in abbreviated form ; the books by brown @xcite and garrett @xcite are two excellent resources for further details .",
    "classically , affine buildings are associated to @xmath131-adic groups , e.g. , @xmath5 , and are characterized as simplicial complexes whose simplicial structure is determined by subgroups and cosets of the @xmath131-adic group being studied . here",
    ", we give a well - known but more arithmetic characterization .",
    "to present the standard nomenclature , the simplicial complex which is the building is itself the union of subcomplexes called apartments , all of which are isomorphic .",
    "apartments of an affine building are tilings of euclidean space , and the structure of the tiling is determined by the associated coxeter diagram which encodes the generators and relations of the weyl group associated to the @xmath131-adic group .",
    "the affine building for @xmath5 is an @xmath132-dimensional simplicial complex in which the maximal orders in @xmath65 comprise the vertices .",

    "we give a concrete realization ; see @xcite or @xcite for further details .",

    "the homothety class of @xmath137 , denoted @xmath138 $ ] , is simply the set of lattices @xmath139 .",
    "it is easy to check that for two lattices @xmath137 and @xmath140 , the homothety classes @xmath138 = [ m]$ ] iff @xmath141 , and that as @xmath137 runs through the set of lattices of @xmath134 , @xmath142 runs through the set of maximal orders of @xmath27 .",
    "thus , the vertices of our building originally given by maximal orders in @xmath27 , may instead be identified with the homothety classes of lattices in @xmath134 . to introduce the simplicial structure ,",
    "we define the notion of incidence : we say that two vertices are incident if there are lattices @xmath137 and @xmath143 representing the vertices such that @xmath144 .",
    "note in this case , @xmath145 , so the definition of incidence is symmetric , and defines the edges ( 1-simplicies ) in the building .",
    "an @xmath146-simplex is characterized by lattices @xmath147 ( representing its vertices ) satisfying @xmath148 , or equivalently flags of length @xmath146 in the @xmath149-vector space @xmath150 .",
    "the maximal simplicies ( @xmath132-simplicies ) are called the chambers of the building .    to make things even more concrete ,",
    "we note ( @xcite ) that there is a one - to - one correspondence between sets of @xmath135 linearly independent lines in @xmath134 ( frames ) and apartments in the building for @xmath5 .",

    "since each vertex in the apartment is the homothety class of a lattice @xmath155 , we may simply identify the vertices in an apartment in the @xmath5 building with the elements of @xmath156 , where we represent the homothety class of @xmath155 by @xmath157 $ ] or after normalizing , by @xmath158 $ ] .    to recast some of our earlier algebraic results in this geometric setting ,",
    "we let @xmath134 be as above , fix a basis @xmath152 for @xmath134 and let @xmath159 be the @xmath8-lattice with basis @xmath160 . identifying @xmath161 with @xmath97 , we observe that for @xmath162 , @xmath163 , so all maximal orders in @xmath27 have the form @xmath164 for some @xmath165 . in corollary",
    "[ cor : characterize - maximal ] , we showed that every maximal order containing @xmath166 can be expressed as @xmath167 .",

    "[ remark : restrict - to - apt ] the significance of the above characterization is twofold .",

    "more significantly is that if we wish to consider orders @xmath10 which contain @xmath28 , the set of maximal orders which contain @xmath10 all lie in a given apartment .",
    "of course there may be many such apartments , but the ability to restrict to a fixed apartment leads not only to the concrete algebraic representation , but more importantly to the geometric one we develop below .",
    "our goal is to give a geometric characterization of split orders , and we begin in our restricted setting of split orders @xmath10 of @xmath20 with @xmath174 . by remark  [ remark :",
    "restrict - to - apt ] , we can and do fix an apartment @xmath175 which contains all the maximal orders @xmath176 that contain a given @xmath10 . via a fixed basis for @xmath134 ( which yields the frame defining @xmath175 ) , we identify the apartment with @xmath177 ; the set of vertices in @xmath175 is identified with @xmath178 . as noted after proposition  [ prop : entries - form - ideals ] , we adopt the succinct presentation of @xmath10 as @xmath179 , with @xmath180 , @xmath181 .      given our identification of the apartment @xmath175 with @xmath133 , the equations of the form @xmath186 are hyperplanes in @xmath133 and represent a subset of the walls in the apartment ; they represent all of the walls if @xmath187 .",
    "it is clear that the inequalities @xmath188 define a convex polytope in @xmath133 which we denote by @xmath189 .",
    "the immediate aim of this section is to establish a one - to - one correspondence between split orders containing @xmath28 and convex polytopes of this form in the apartment @xmath175 .",
    "we have already seen ( [ eqn : convex - hull ] ) that the convex hull determined by the walls of the building which contain the set of maximal orders containing a given split order forms a convex polytope .",
