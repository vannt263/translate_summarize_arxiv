    "nanomechanical single - electron transistors in which a mechanical resonator forms the voltage gate of the transistor constitute a new and interesting class of nanoelectromechanical system .",
    "the idea of coupling a nanomechanical resonator to the island of a single electron transistor ( set ) as a mechanically compliant voltage gate was proposed as a way of measuring the displacement of a mechanical resonator with high precision  @xcite , since the conductance properties of the set are extremely sensitive to the resonator motion .",
    "indeed such devices have recently been used to measure the displacement of a nanomechanical resonator with almost quantum limited precision  @xcite .    the sensitivity with which a set can be used to measure the position of a nanomechanical resonator",
    "is ultimately limited by the back - action of the set on the dynamics of the resonator . the back - action of electrons moving through a _ normal state _ set gated by a nanomechanical resonator was studied recently  @xcite and it was shown that , in the regime where the energy associated with the applied bias voltage is much larger than the resonator energy quanta , the set electrons act on the nanomechanical resonator in a way which is closely analogous to an equilibrium thermal bath .",
    "in fact , the dynamics of the resonator can be described by a fokker - planck equation for a damped harmonic oscillator in contact with a thermal bath at a fixed temperature  @xcite .",
    "very similar results were obtained explicitly for a resonator coupled to a tunnel junction  @xcite and it was also shown by clerk  @xcite that such behaviour is expected to be generic within the regime of linear response .",
    "in contrast to normal state sets where the current arises solely from electron tunnelling and cotunnelling processes  @xcite , superconducting sets ( ssets ) can support a wide range of different electronic processes which contribute to the current including tunnelling or cotunnelling of quasiparticles , coherent tunnelling of cooper pairs and even andreev reflection  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there exist a number of current resonances for particular values of the drain - source and gate voltages of the sset where current is carried by a combination of different processes occuring at the source and drain junctions in turn .",
    "the best known ( and most readily observed experimentally ) current resonances for the sset are the josephson quasiparticle ( jqp ) and double josephson quasiparticle ( djqp ) cycles where transport occurs via a combination of coherent , resonant tunnelling of cooper pairs and incoherent quasiparticle tunnelling  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we analyse the back - action of a sset on a nanomechanical resonator .",
    "in particular , we investigate the dynamics of a resonator coupled as a voltage - gate to a sset which is tuned in the vicinity of the jqp or the djqp resonance .",
    "we find that for both resonances the resonator can act as though it were coupled to a thermal bath with its dynamics described by a fokker - planck equation , as was found for the normal state set .",
    "however , the magnitudes of the effective temperature and damping of the resonator in the vicinity of the jqp and djqp resonances differ substantially , both from each other and from those for the normal state case .",
    "a resonator coupled to a normal state set has an effective temperature which is proportional to the drain - source voltage applied to the set and is always damped .",
    "in contrast , the effective temperature of a resonator coupled to a sset in the vicinity of the jqp or djqp resonance is largely controlled by how far the sset is biased from the resonance , rather than the magnitude of the drain - source voltage , and hence can easily be an order of magnitude smaller than the effective temperature for an analogous normal state set . furthermore , as the applied gate and drain - source voltages are adjusted to tune the sset through a given jqp resonance , we find that the fokker - planck description breaks down sufficiently close to the resonance , while further from the resonance on the other side the fokker - planck description is restored once again , but with negative effective temperature and resonator damping constant implying the possibility of a dynamic instability .",
    "very similar results for the sset - resonator system have also been obtained independently using a different approach by clerk and bennett  @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of a nanomechanical resonator coupled to a sset in the vicinity of the jqp resonance bears a striking resemblance to a number of other physical systems . in particular",
    ", the behaviour of the effective temperature of the resonator in the vicinity of the jqp resonance takes a very similar form to that of atoms undergoing doppler cooling due to their interactions with laser light  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the minimum effective temperature of both a resonator in the vicinity of the jqp resonance and doppler - cooled atoms are given by a decay rate : the quasiparticle decay rate for the sset - resonator system and the decay rate of the excited state for the atoms .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we introduce a master equation describing the coupled statistical dynamics of the sset - resonator system in the vicinity of the jqp resonance ( a similar master equation for the sset - resonator system in the vicinity of the djqp resonance is described in the appendix ) .",
    "we then show that the master equation can be well - approximated by a fokker - planck equation under conditions of weak coupling and wide separation of sset and oscillator dynamics timescales . in section 3 we present analytic and numerical calculations of",
    "the sset - induced damping , frequency renormalization and effective temperature in the vicinity of the jqp and djqp resonances . in section 4",
    ", we discuss our results and the analogy between the sset - resonator device and other physical systems , before we finally present our conclusions .",
    "in this section we obtain a master equation for the sset - resonator system in the vicinity of the jqp resonance and show that the dynamics of the resonator can be described by a fokker - planck equation .",
    "the same approach can also be used to derive analogous results for the djqp resonance , details of which are given in the appendix .",
    "the model circuit that we consider is shown in figure  [ model ] .",
    "the sset consists of a small superconducting island and two superconducting leads weakly - linked to the island via tunnel junctions with capacitances @xmath0 ; a drain - source bias voltage @xmath1 is applied to the leads .",
    "the nanomechanical resonator is treated as a single - mode harmonic oscillator with frequency @xmath2 and mass @xmath3 .",
    "the metallized resonator is located adjacent the sset island , forming a gate with capacitance @xmath4 , which depends on the resonator s displacement @xmath5 ; a gate voltage @xmath6 is applied to the resonator . in the experiments of refs .",
    "@xcite , the coupling between the sset island and the resonator is typically very weak so that the displacement of the resonator from its equilibrium position is much less than the separation @xmath7 between that equilibrium position and the sset island itself .",
    "hence if we also assume a parallel - plate geometry for simplicity , the gate capacitance can be approximated by  @xcite : @xmath8 , implying linear coupling between the sset and the resonator  @xcite .",
    "the central island of the sset is taken to be sufficiently small that its charging energy @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the superconducting gap and @xmath11 is the temperature of the quasiparticles in the leads .",
    "hence , the number of charge states accessible to the island is severely restricted .",
    "the josephson coupling between the leads and the island is @xmath12 , where @xmath13 the resistance of the junctions  @xcite .",
    "depending on the exact value of the polarization charge induced on the sset island by the resonator gate , @xmath14 , certain quasiparticle and resonant cooper pair tunnelling processes can become energetically favourable leading to a number of possible current carrying regimes such as the jqp and djqp cycles . at sufficiently large drain - source voltages , and for relatively low junction resistances , it is also possible for current to flow via higher order processes such as quasiparticle co - tunnelling , but we will neglect such effects in what follows .",
    "the details of the specific electronic processes which occur at the jqp and djqp resonances are illustrated schematically in figure  [ jqp ] .",
    "close to the jqp resonance , cooper pairs tunnel between the right ( with reference to the circuit in figure  [ model ] ) , drain electrode and island , while electron quasiparticles tunnel out from the island to the left , source electrode . alternatively",
    ", cooper pair tunnelling can occur between the left source electrode and island , while electron quasiparticles tunnel in from the right drain electrode to the island . which of these two jqp cycles takes place depends on the gate and drain - source voltage biases .",
    "we shall consider biases such that only the former cycle occurs ( i.e. , that illustrated in figure  [ jqp]a ) .",
    "we seek a master equation that describes the dynamics of the island charge state of the sset and the position - velocity state of the resonator s center - of - mass valid in the vicinity of the jqp resonance .",
    "master equations for the island charges in normal state and superconducting sets have been derived by a number of groups using essentially the same technique  @xcite . starting with the full ( time - dependent ) schrdinger equation for the system , one traces over the microscopic electronic degrees of freedom making use of a second - order born approximation ( that treats the quasiparticle tunnelling rates between the island and the leads as a small expansion parameter ) , followed by a long - time limit markov approximation ( that treats the response of the electrons in the leads to a tunnelling event as being instantaneous ) , to arrive at a master equation for a reduced density matrix represented in the basis of total number of electrons , @xmath15 , on the island .",
    "we generalise this approach to include the resonator .",
    "again starting from a fully quantum hamiltonian , we follow the same procedure of the born and markov approximations and trace over the microscopic degrees of freedom .",
    "however , we also assume that the resonator does not evolve at all on the time - scale of the quasiparticle tunnelling processes .",
    "essentially this means that we are treating the resonator as a classical oscillator .",
    "finally we take the wigner transform  @xcite of the resulting equations to obtain the desired master equation which can be thought of as providing a semiclassical description of the coupled dynamics  @xcite .    for the jqp process ( see figure  [ jqp]a ) , the island electron number can be @xmath15 , @xmath16 or @xmath17 , with the @xmath15 and @xmath17 number states linked by coherent cooper pair tunnelling .",
    "hence the associated set of coupled semiclassical master equations has diagonal components @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and off - diagonal component @xmath21 , where @xmath5 and @xmath22 are the position and velocity coordinates , respectively , of the oscillator . in our semiclassical description , the sum @xmath23 is the probability density @xmath24 of finding the oscillator at the point in phase space @xmath25 at time @xmath26 , while the integral @xmath27 gives the probability @xmath28 that the island electron number is @xmath15 at time @xmath26 , with the probability conservation @xmath29 .",

    "it is not clear why the agreement is so good , but the most obvious explanation is that the cancellation of the @xmath131 dependent terms that occurs in our approximate expression for the ratio @xmath132 must extend beyond second order in @xmath131 .",
    "figure  [ map ] shows schematically the @xmath1 and @xmath6 bias ranges in relation to the jqp resonance lines for which the curves in figures  [ jqpc ] and  [ tset ] are obtained .",
    "note that , because the quasiparticle tunnel rates and their gradients have been approximated as constants equal to unity for simplicity , the jqp curves in figures  [ jqpc ] and  [ tset ] do not depend on the @xmath1 bias choice . with the dependences of the tunnel rates on the energies",
    "@xmath37 and @xmath38 properly taken into account [ see equations ( [ tunnelrate ] ) and ( [ dos ] ) ] , one finds that the maximum and minimum values of the @xmath126 and @xmath127 curves increase in magnitude as @xmath1 decreases towards the onset for the jqp cycle at @xmath133 .",
    "in contrast , as we shall see below the djqp curves depend strongly on the @xmath1 bias choice even when the quasiparticle tunnel rates are approximated as constants .",
    "the results obtained from the numerical integrations of the master equations agree well with those obtained within the born - markov approximation .",
    "as expected , the agreement between the two improves as the magnitude of @xmath134 is reduced , in accord with our use of the approximation @xmath59 in deriving the reduced master equation .",
    "in addition , the numerical integration of the master equations gives us one more piece of information that we could not have obtained from our calculations within the born - markov approximation .",
    "very close to the resonance we find that the evolution of @xmath124 no longer matches that of a damped harmonic oscillator .",
    "are all obtained from a fit to the behaviour of a damped harmonic oscillator .",
    "close to the resonance where this fit is not readily obtained we were not able to extract values for @xmath119 and hence no corresponding data points are plotted for @xmath135 .",
    "thus , it seems that very close to the resonance the action of the sset on the resonator is not analogous to a thermal bath .",
    "although we have not carried out a systematic investigation of the region in which deviations from thermal bath - like behaviour occur , we do find that the width of the region ( in terms of @xmath39 ) broadens with increasing @xmath134 .",
    "this suggests that the weak coupling ( born ) approximation we use to derive the fokker - planck equation may break down for @xmath136 ( i.e. , @xmath137 ) .",
    "the coefficients @xmath126 and @xmath127 calculated within the born - markov approximation are shown in figure [ djqp ] , while the corresponding variation in @xmath138 is shown in figure [ tsetdjqp ] . to facilitate comparisons with the jqp resonance",
    "we have chosen @xmath139 and @xmath140 as independent variables , in terms of which the other energy detuning is @xmath141 .",
    "the relation between the range of set bias points covered in figures [ djqp ] and [ tsetdjqp ] are illustrated schematically in figure [ map ] .",
    "the djqp resonance is much more complex than the jqp one and our results by no means cover the whole range of the relevant parameter space .",
    "however , by comparing figures [ jqpc ] and [ djqp ] , it is clear that the magnitude of @xmath127 , and hence @xmath142 , is generally much larger for the djqp resonance than for the jqp one . as we shall discuss below",
    ", this implies that in an experiment the effects of the back - action due to the sset on the resonator dynamics will be stronger close to the djqp resonance .    by analogy with the jqp resonance , it seems inevitable that there will be regions very close to the djqp resonances where our born - markov approximation will fail to capture fully the physics of the system .",
    "however , because of the additional complexity of the djqp cycle , we have not as yet performed the necessary numerical integrations of the master equations required to determine exactly where and how the born - markov approach breaks down .",
    "we now turn to consider the implications of our results for experiments on nanomechanical - set systems and to explore the analogies which exist with other physical systems .    in an experiment the overall state of the resonator",
    "would be determined by the combined effects of the sset and the external surroundings of the resonator other than the sset , which can be modelled by a damping rate , @xmath143 , and a temperature , @xmath144 .",
    "the overall effective temperature and damping rate of the resonator would be given by the weighted averages  @xcite , @xmath145 from these relations , it is clear that when @xmath119 becomes negative @xmath146 will decrease , eventually leading to a dynamic instability in the state of the resonator when @xmath147 .",
    "however , we should point out that the model described here is not sufficiently robust to explore precisely what would happen in this regime .",
    "the expressions for the effective temperature and damping rate also make clear that for @xmath148 , the effective temperature of the resonator will be dominated by @xmath118 .",
    "this has a number of important implications given the minima in @xmath118 which develop close to the jqp and djqp resonances .",
    "for example , the minimum value of @xmath118 which is simply proportional to the quasiparticle decay rate can easily be as low as @xmath149mk , suggesting that the electronic back - action on the resonator could be demonstrated in a dramatic way by using the sset to cool the resonator when @xmath150 .",
    "indeed a close analogy can be made between the temperature of a resonator coupled to a sset and that of ( two - level ) atoms undergoing doppler cooling due to counter - propagating laser beams  @xcite .    in doppler cooling , the interaction between laser beams and two of the atoms energy levels leads to an effective damping of the atomic translational motion .",
    "the atoms are cooled to a temperature that depends on the detuning of the laser light from the atomic resonance , with the opposite sign to that given in ref .",
    "@xcite . ] , @xmath10 , and the decay rate of the excited atomic state , @xmath151 , given by the relation  @xcite @xmath152 this equation has an almost identical form to that for @xmath128 close to the jqp resonance [ equation ( [ approxtset ] ) ] .",
    "it is interesting to note that a more direct analogy between doppler cooling and a system consisting of a resonator coupled to a cooper pair box ( cpb )  @xcite addressed by an additional , fixed voltage gate was suggested recently  @xcite .",
    "the effective temperature of the resonator in that case takes exactly the same form as that near the jqp resonance when an appropriate ac - voltage is applied to the extra fixed gate  @xcite , although the relevant decay rate is not related to quasiparticle tunnelling and the associated expression for the damping of the resonator takes a different form to that considered here .",
    "another system that might be expected to have very similar dynamics to the sset - resonator system is that of a double quantum dot ( dqd ) gated by a mechanical resonator  @xcite .",
    "since dqds display an electronic resonance which is in many ways analogous to the jqp cycle , the dynamics of a resonator coupled to a dqd should be very similar to that of one coupled to a sset near the jqp resonance .",
    "experiments on dqd - resonator systems have not yet been performed , but work on gating individual quantum dots by mechanical resonators  @xcite demonstrates that such systems are certainly a feasible prospect .",
    "our work raises a number of interesting questions for future research .",
    "for example , in the regime that we examined , the strongly non - linear properties of the quasiparticle tunnelling rates played no role . it would be interesting to examine the dynamics of the resonator for parameters close to the threshold for quasiparticle tunnelling so that the motion of the resonator itself could control whether or not tunnelling occurs . also of interest",
    "is our finding that the self - consistent born - markov approximation method apparently can not capture the physics of the system when it is tuned extremely close to the jqp resonance ; this raises the intriguing possibility that the resonator dynamics in this regime differs substantially from the thermalized dynamics described here .",
    "furthermore , we have not yet examined the conditions under which born - markov approximation breaks down for the djqp resonance , though this is an area we plan to explore in future work .    in conclusion , we have found that , like a normal state set , a superconducting set in the vicinity of either the jqp or djqp resonance acts on a nanomechanical resonator like an equilibrium thermal bath for sufficiently weak electro - mechanical coupling and for sufficiently large separation between the electrical and mechanical time - scales . however , the effective temperature , damping and frequency shift of the resonator due to a sset close to the jqp and djqp resonances take very different forms , both from each other and from the normal state set . in particular , the magnitude and even the sign of the effective temperature and damping for the sset depend very sensitively on where it is tuned with respect to either the jqp or djqp resonance .",
