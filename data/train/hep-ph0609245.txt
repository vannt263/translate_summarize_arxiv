    "interpreting the electric dipole moments of leptons and baryons as constraints on fundamental , cp - violating lagrangian parameters of various extensions of the standard model ( sm ) gives key insight into tev - scale physics . in this contribution",
    "i report on work in collaboration with stan brodsky and dae sung hwang  @xcite , in which we sharpen the connection between the computed neutron electric dipole moment and fundamental cp violation by comparing its hadronic matrix element to that of the anomalous magnetic moment . in the context of the sm , and , specifically , of the cabbibo - kobasyashi - maskawa ( ckm ) mechanism of cp violation , the assessed values of the neutron electric dipole moment ( edm ) have been disparate , ranging from @xmath0  @xcite arising from a @xmath1 loop calculation in a chiral lagrangian treatment , to @xmath2  @xcite for the edm of the @xmath3-quark itself , computed to three - loop precision in leading - logarithmic approximation .",
    "these edms are much too small to be experimentally observable , so that the marked disparity is actually of little consequence . however ,",
    "if we restrict ourselves to effective cp - violating operators of dimension five or less , the method of qcd sum rules can be employed to compute the edm of the neutron  @xcite , yielding a value for @xmath4 , induced by a qcd @xmath5-term , e.g. , commensurate in size with that of the chiral estimate  @xcite , with a surety of @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "the evaluation of @xmath4 and @xmath7 , and the errors therein , is also important to interpreting the @xmath8 edm  @xcite .",
    "here we analyze the nucleon electric dipole moment in the light - front formalism of qcd  @xcite , to the end of realizing an independent test of the methods used to compute @xmath9  and of their assessed errors .",
    "our study of the electric dipole form factor @xmath10 in the light - front formalism of qcd complements earlier studies of the dirac and pauli form factors  @xcite .",
    "the pauli and electric dipole form factors emerge from the spin - flip matrix elements of the electromagnetic current @xmath11 : @xmath12 \\ , u(p,\\lambda)\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is a dirac spinor for a nucleon of momentum @xmath14 and helicity @xmath15 , with @xmath16 .",
    "recall that the anomalous magnetic moment @xmath17 and the electric dipole moment @xmath3 are given by @xmath18 $ ] and @xmath19 $ ] .",
    "we find a close connection between @xmath17 and @xmath3  @xcite , as long anticipated  @xcite .",
    "working in the @xmath20 frame , with @xmath21 and @xmath22 , in the interaction picture for @xmath23 , and in the assumed simple vacuum of the light - front formalism , we find , noting @xmath24 , @xmath25 [ { \\mathrm d}^2 \\mathbf{k}_{\\perp } ] \\sum_j e_j \\",
    "\\frac{1}{2}\\   \\big[\\ ,    -\\frac{1}{q^l } \\psi^{\\uparrow * } _ { a}(x_i,\\mathbf{k}^\\prime_{\\perp i},\\lambda_i ) \\ , \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times \\psi^\\downarrow_{a } ( x_i , \\mathbf{k}_{\\perp i},\\lambda_i )   \\pm   \\frac{1}{q^r } \\psi^{\\downarrow * } _ { a}(x_i,\\mathbf{k}^\\prime_{\\perp i},\\lambda_i ) \\ , \\psi^\\uparrow_{a } ( x_i , \\mathbf{k}_{\\perp i},\\lambda_i)\\ , \\big ] { } \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 for the struck constituent @xmath27 and @xmath28 for each spectator ( @xmath29 ) . the electric dipole form factor",
    "@xmath10 vanishes if the usual light - front wave functions are employed , so that we must learn how parity- and time - reversal - violating effects can be included in the light - cone framework .",
    "we construct parity @xmath30 and time - reversal @xmath31 in the light - front formalism  @xcite by noting that these operations should act on the @xmath32 of a free particle alone , so that @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 remain unchanged .",
    "we choose @xmath30 so that the components of a vector @xmath36 transform as @xmath37 , @xmath38 , or @xmath39 , and @xmath40 . with this @xmath30",
    "is an unitary operator , though it flips the spin as well .",
    "we find that @xmath41 is even and @xmath10 is odd under @xmath30 .",
    "the choice of @xmath31 is predicated by that for @xmath30 ; a momentum vector @xmath42 transforms as @xmath43 and @xmath44 under @xmath31 , so that the position vector @xmath45 . with this",
    "we find that @xmath31 is antiunitary , but it does not flip the spin . with the charge - conjugation operator @xmath46 defined in the usual way , we note that all scalar fermion bilinears are invariant under @xmath47 as needed .",
    "we find that @xmath48 and @xmath49 are even and @xmath50 and @xmath51 are odd under @xmath31 .",
    "thus to realize a non - zero electric dipole form factor , we must include a @xmath31- and @xmath30-odd parameter @xmath52 in the light - front wave function @xmath53 ; namely , @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is both @xmath30- and @xmath31- invariant .",
    "we assume @xmath56 is broken at scales much larger than those of interest , so that @xmath57 and that any @xmath58-dependence in @xmath52 can be neglected . with this",
    "we find , for a fock component @xmath59  @xcite , @xmath60_a = ( \\tan\\beta_a ) [ f_2 ( q^2)]_a    % d_a = ( \\tan\\beta_a ) 2\\kappa_a \\quad \\hbox{and }   \\quad d_a = 2\\kappa_a   \\beta_a \\quad \\hbox{as } \\quad q^2\\to 0 \\ , , \\label{rel}\\ ] ] since @xmath52 is small .",
    "thus the edm and the anomalous magnetic moment of the nucleon should both be computed with a given method , to test for consistency .",
    "if the method employed is unable to confront the empirical anomalous magnetic moments successfully , it can not be trusted to predict the electric dipole moments reliably .",
    "we note in the case of the qcd sum rule method , that the computed anomalous magnetic moments , as long known , are in good agreement with experiment , namely , @xmath61 and @xmath62  @xcite .",
    "we now consider some specific consequences of eq .",
    "( [ rel ] ) . in what follows",
    "we consider the edm induced through a qcd @xmath5-term only . in a quark  scalar - diquark , @xmath63 , model of the nucleon a single @xmath30- and @xmath31-violating parameter @xmath64 suffices to characterize @xmath9 . since @xmath65 is isoscalar , @xmath66 , and we can employ the empirical anomalous magnetic moments @xmath67 and @xmath68 , in units of @xmath69 , to estimate @xmath70 .",
    "the isoscalar electric dipole moment of the nucleon is extremely small .",
    "this is in accord with the chiral lagrangian estimate , for which it is zero  the relevant diagrams are mediated by a @xmath1 loop , which is logarithmically enhanced as @xmath71  @xcite .",
    "our estimate can be compared to the qcd sum rule calculation , for which @xmath72  @xcite , which is much larger .",
    "we note that the qcd sum rule method also predicts a zero isoscalar magnetic moment  @xcite ; the method is less successful in reproducing a quantity which suffers partial cancellation .",
    "the @xmath73 magnetic moment is determined not only by the sum of @xmath74 but also by a cp - violating meson - exchange current  the former is estimated to be numerically larger  @xcite .",
    "the efficacy of a edm measurement in a particular system in bounding @xmath5 is determined by the size of the coefficient multiplying @xmath5 .",
    "the larger the coefficient , the better the bound on @xmath5 , for a given experimental limit . were @xmath75 smaller",
    ", the bound on @xmath5 from a putative @xmath76 edm measurement would weaken .",
    "in summary , we have analyzed the electromagnetic form factors in the light - front formalism of qcd , extending the earlier drell - yan - west - brodsky framework to the analysis of @xmath30 and @xmath31-odd observables .",
    "we have used the light - front formalism to find a general equality between the anomalous magnetic and electric dipole moments .",
    "the relation holds for spin-@xmath77 systems , in general : it is not specific to the neutron and is independent of the mechanism of cp violation .",
    "an earlier study noting the importance of the simultaneous study of the muon s electric dipole and anomalous magnetic moments is given in ref .",
    "the relation we derive implies that both the edm and anomalous magnetic moment of the spin-@xmath77 system of interest should be calculated in a given model , to test for consistency .",
    "ultimately , this can lead to sharpened constraints on models containing non - ckm sources of cp violation .",
