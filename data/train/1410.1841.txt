    "this is the update of our study of the near - future dynamical evolution of comet c/2013 a1 siding spring .",
    "comet siding spring comes from the oort spike ( with @xmath2 about @xmath3au@xmath4 for purely gravitational model of motion , see table  [ tab : models ] ) and experiences close encounters with mars on 2014  october  19 .",
    "our preliminary solutions were based on the 713  positional measurements from 2012 october  4 to 2014 march  3 . at that time , the comet was more than 3au from the sun and non - gravitational ( ng ) effects were indeterminable in its motion . thus , to include ng effects to our analysis , we constructed a grid of various radial ( described by constant parameter @xmath5 ) and/or transverse ( @xmath6 ) components of ng acceleration using standard ng  model of motion given by marsden , sekanina and yeomans ( 1973 , hereafter msy ) .",
    "these preliminary results were presented at the beginning of july in helsinki at acm conference @xcite and also are reproduced in fig 1 .    here , we show the results based on six months longer sequence of astrometric data ( up to september 21 ) .",
    "we analyze how selection and weighting of observations influence on the estimates of the comet position during its close encounter with mars .",
    "we also determine very preliminary ng  orbit using msy model ",
    "it is important to stress however , that the comet is still on ingoing leg of its orbit , and ng  solutions are very uncertain .",
    "additionally , to better understand future close approach to mars , for each of models described below , a sample of 5001 vos ( including the nominal orbit ) was constructed by using method given by sitarski ( 1998 ) .",
    "we present here three purely gravitational models , which differ in the data set treatment .",
    "solution  g1 ( see table  [ tab : elements ] ) is derived using only selection procedure , solution  g2 is based on data selected and weighted in an iterative process of orbit determination ( for more details see @xcite ) , and solution  g3 is obtained using the normal places instead of some series of measurements taken on the same day ; therefore , in this last gr  model the number of residuals taken for orbit determination was drastically reduced from more than 2000 to 577 .",
    "table  [ tab : elements ] shows all these three osculating orbital solutions , the numbers of residuals taken for orbit determination are also given there .",
    "to determine the ng  cometary orbit the standard formalism described by msy was used , where ng  acceleration can be written as    @xmath7^{-4.614}}_{g(r){\\rm - \\>function\\>symmetric\\>relative\\>to\\>perihelion}},\\qquad a_{\\rm i}={\\rm ~const~~for}\\quad{\\rm i}=1,2,3,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath8 are the radial , transverse and normal components of the ng  acceleration , respectively , and the radial acceleration is defined outward along the sun - comet line .",
    "the normalization constant @xmath9 gives @xmath10  au@xmath11 ; the scale distance @xmath12  au .    an asymmetric model of ng",
    "acceleration can be derived by using @xmath13 instead of @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "this last model introduces an additional ng  parameter @xmath15  the time displacement of the maximum of the @xmath16 relative to the moment of perihelion passage .",
    "we found that only the symmetric model of ng  motion can be applicable for c/2013 a1 at this moment ( see below ) .    here",
    ", two ng  solutions are presented for two different data treatment : ng  model based on non - weighting data , and ng  model derived using weighting procedure for the data set ( model a ) ; in both cases three ng  parameters were determined , where parameter @xmath5 is negative ( solutions with assumed @xmath17 also give negative @xmath5 ) .",
    "we noticed , however , no improvement in the fit to the data in comparison to the purely gravitational solutions .",
    "we found that asymmetric ng  solutions with the maximum of the @xmath16 shifted more than 200 days before perihelion gives positive @xmath5 and slightly smaller rms , however such a solution seems to be even more exotic than two symmetric models presented here .",
    "we also obtained the ng  model using normal places instead of some original measurements .",
    "this solution , however , gives even more negative radial component of ng  acceleration .",
    "therefore , the results based on this model are not presented here .",
    "we also determined the ng  solution ( on the basis of 1159  measurements taken up to september  21 ) using the parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 given by farnocchia at @xcite ( available on october  1 ) and based on 180  observations selected by him from more than 2000  taken in the period 2012  oct .",
    "42014  sept .",
    "26 ( model b ) .    to determined the more realistic ng  solution for c/2013  a1 we probably have to wait a few months .",
    "for example , at @xcite only purely gravitational orbital solution was presented at this moment ( october  1 ) .",
    "results of our investigations are summarized in the table 2 and figure 2 , where three solutions are based on purely gravitational motion and differ in data treatment ( as was described above ) and the next set of three solutions include ng  acceleration in the model of motion .",
    ", width=491 ]     , width=491 ]",
    "we analyzed the close approach of the comet c/2013 a1 ( siding spring ) with mars by using the observational arc from 2012 october 4 to 2014 october 21 .",
    "for detailed analysis of our models a sample of 5001 vo ( including the nominal orbit ) was generated .",
    "we created three purely gravitational models based on non - weighted data , weighted data and using the normal places instead of some series of measurements taken on the same day .",
    "though the non - gravitational model of motion is still very uncertain , we also analyzed how non - gravitational perturbations can change the close encounter predictions .",
    "presented calculations confirm the widespread opinion that the comet c/2013",
    "a1 siding spring will not collide with mars .",
    "our more detailed conclusions can be summarized as below :    1 .   using the purely gravitational models , we obtained that the nominal closest distance to mars of the comet c/2013 a1 will be : 140150km@xmath18155 km ( non - weighted model ) , 140300@xmath18130 km ( weighted model ) and 139840@xmath19380 km in case of the solution based on the normal places , respectively ( @xmath20 error estimates ) .",
    "we conclude that the comet may pass the mars a little farther in comparison with @xcite and our previous ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also fig .",
    "[ fig : grcomparison ] ) estimates . 2 .",
    "our gr  solutions as well as ng  solution with assumed ng  parameters are generally in a very good agreement with newer ng  solution present by farnocchia at @xcite , though our estimate of formal uncertainties ( @xmath21-error ) seems smaller for each individual solution .",
    "2 shows that the data treatment causes larger uncertainties of the close encounter with mars than the uncertainties of each of individual gr  solution .",
    "3 .   in the case of non - gravitational perturbations we did not obtain significant differences between gravitational solutions , as also was predicted by @xcite .",
    "including ng  perturbations to our analysis , we noticed significantly larger values of uncertainties of close encounters with mars .",
