    "detection of magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) waves and oscillations may be very important in diagnosing the local plasma conditions of the coronae of sun and sun - like stars by impying the principle of mhd seismology ( e.g. , nakariakov & verwichte 2005 ; andries et al . , 2009 ) .",
    "mhd waves ( _ e.g. _ , alfvn , slow and fast magnetoacoustic waves ) are well explored and studied in recent days in the solar atmosphere ( i.e. in its chromosphere and corona ) using the high resolution observations from solar and heliospheric observatory ( soho ) , transition region and coronal explorer ( trace ) , hinode , stereo , and solar dynamics observatory ( sdo ) , along with the advancement vis - a - vis theoretical modeling and simulations ( e.g. , aschwanden et al .",

    "these waves can transport the solar photospheric powers into its chromosphere and corona in order to fulfill the fraction of energy losses .",
    "the advanced mhd seismology techniques have been elaborately developed to examine the crucial plasma conditions of the solar atmosphere based on the detection of the multiple harmonics of mhd waves ( e.g. , mcewan et al .",

    "complementing that the detection of mhd waves are getting enough importance in the development of the refined mhd seismology techniques to understand the properties of solar corona , it is also worth to state that there are several attempts to detect various mhd waves in the stellar coronae of sun - like stars ( e.g. , stepanov et al .",

    "the origin of such oscillations are still under debate , however , it is studied recently that they can be produced by several mechanisms during the flaring activities in the magnetized coronae of the sun - like stars ( e.g. , nakariakov & melnikov 2009 , and references cited there ) .",
    "the widely accepted scenario behind the evolution of such quasi - periodic oscillations is the excitation of mhd wave modes in the stellar coronal structures . in the recent work , the slow mode oscillations are reported firstly by mitra - kraev et al.(2005 ) in the flaring loop of at mic , while the magnetoaocustic kink waves have been reported by pandey & srivastava ( 2009 ) in the corona of @xmath5-boo .",
    "mathioudakis et al .",
    "( 2006 ) have reported the observational scenario of very high frequency oscillations in the atmosphere of active star eq peg b , which may excite either due to fast mhd waves or due to the repetitive magnetic reconnection .",
    "recently , anfinogentov et al . (",
    "2013 ) have found the evidence of various types of mhd oscillations in the dme star yz cmi .",
    "however , most of the attempts in previous works were related to the detection of single mhd mode oscillations in the stellar coronae and their loops . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", there were no extensive efforts in the past to detect the multiple mhd modes and thus the based seismology of the stellar coronae .    in the present paper ,",
    "we firstly detect the first two harmonics of the slow magnetoacoustic oscillations in the corona of a dme star proxima centauri using observations carried out by xmm - newton .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec.2 , we present briefly the observations and adopted loop parameters .",
    "we describe the detection of mhd modes in sec .  3 .",
    "in sec .  4 , we explain the mhd seismology of the corona of proxima centauri . in sec .  5 ,",
    "the discussions and conclusions are outlined .",
    "we choose a flaring epoch in the corona of proxima centauri observed with the xmm - newton satellite using epic detector on march 13 - 14 , 2009 ( obs i d - 0551120401 ) .",
    "details of observations and data reduction are given in fuhrmeister et al .",
    "the top panel of fig .  1 shows the light curve of a flaring epoch of proxima centauri in the 0.3 - 10.0 kev energy band .",
    "the flare starts at 06:00 ut , peaks at 06:45 ut , and show a long decay phase upto 09:00 ut on march , 14 2009 .",
    "the region between two dashed vertical lines is a region of our interest where we have searched for the localized mhd oscillations candidates .",
    "bottom panel of fig .",
    "1 shows this localized temporal span of the light curve during 12 - 21 ks in which the best fit exponential functions of the form @xmath6 are fitted to remove the long term background flare variations . using the spectral modeling",
    "the flare peak temperature was derived to be @xmath7 mk . however , average temperature during the post flare phase ( i.e flare duration between 12 - 21 ks ) was derived to @xmath8 mk ( see table 3 of fuhrmeister et al . , 2011 )      using the time - dependent hydrodynamic loop model of reale et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , fuhrmeister et al .",
    "( 2011 ) derived the loop half length of @xmath9 cm .",
    "this method includes both plasma cooling and the effect of heating during flare decay , however , sometime over - estimates the loop length ( reale 2007 ) . if we assume that the flare emission originated from an ensemble of coronal loops with uniform cross section and roughly semicircular midplane shape , then we can express the observed volume emission measure ( vem ) in terms of the loop length ( l ) , density ( @xmath10 ) , number of loops ( n ) , and aspect ratio ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "following huenemoerder et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , the loop length is derived as , l = @xmath12@xmath13n@xmath14vem@xmath15@xmath16 . using peak emission measure of the flare of @xmath17 @xmath18 and density of @xmath19 @xmath20 ( fuhrmeister et al .",
    "2011 ) , and assuming 100 flaring loops with aspect ratio of 0.1 , the loop - length was calculated to be @xmath21 cm .",
    "using statistical loop length and peak temperature relation , @xmath22 , which leads the theoretically predicted scaling law of @xmath23 and further explains observed correlation of @xmath24 for both solar and stellar flares ( aschwanden et al .",
    "2008 ) , the loop length is calculated to be @xmath25 cm .",
    "the loop lengths derived from above these two methods are consistent with each other . however , these loop lengths are smaller than the one derived from a single - loop hydrodynamic model .",
    "our derived loop length using the multi - loop model is though similar to those derived for other flaring dwarfs ( pandey & singh 2008 ) , therefore for further analysis we have used the loop lenght of @xmath26 cm .",
    "we have used wavelet analysis idl code @xmath27randomlet@xmath27 that performs randomization test ( oshea et al . , 2001 ) along with the standard wavelet analysis ( torrence & compo 1998 ) to examine the statistically significant real periodicities in the time series data and to compute the associated powers .",
    "we use the flare light curve in 0.3 - 10 kev energy band and vary time bin size from 50 - 90 s. we clearly notice a consistent and localized oscillatory pattern in the post flare phase of the emission ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "we do not choose the lower binning as we were not interested in the very high - frequency oscillations of stellar loops . using standard wavelet tool",
    "as discussed above , we derive the power spectra for each of these light curves during the post flare phase between 12 - 20 ks .",
    "we detect almost similar harmonic periods in each binning of the data ( cf . ,",
    "table 1).here we present one example of the detected harmonic periods in fig .  2 related with the 70 s binned data .",
    "depicted in fig .",
    "2 is the result from the wavelet analysis , in which the top panel displays the de - trended light curve of 70 s binned data during the post - flare phase heightened emissions ( cf . ,",
    "top and bottom panels of fig .  1 ; sec .  1 ) .",
    "in the middle - left panel of fig .  2 , we plot the intensity wavelet that shows the bursty and localized nature of the oscillations and related powers .",
    "these oscillatory periods of 1261 & 687 s were sustained for first 90 and 50 minutes with @xmath28 4 cycles , respectively .",
    "the middle - right panel in fig .",
    "2 shows the global power spectrum with a significant periodicity of 1261 s with the probability grater than 99 % .",
    "we notice that the other bursty power lies at 687 s in the intensity wavelet and corresponding global power peak is also present .",
    "the bottom - panel displays the temporal variation of probabilities of the detection of these periodicities also exhibit in localized region .",
    "the other larger periods ( @xmath283000 s ) may persist in the un - trended light curve , however , we searched for the periods that are naturally excited and associated with the possible mhd modes excited in the flaring stellar loops having certain morphological and plasma properties . therefore , the periods of our interest , which are most likely associated with the mhd activity of the loops , can be only detected after pre - whitening of these long term variations ( oshea et al .",
    "2007 ; anfinogentov et al . , 2013 ) .",
    "the wavelet results are consistent with the lomb - scargle periodogram analyses of the same light curve ( scargle 1982 ) . in fig .  3",
    ", we show the detection of almost similar periodicities near @xmath29 s and @xmath30 s respectively that are above 1-@xmath31 level . a higher period of 8000 s is also seen in the power spectra which is equivalent to the total data length",
    ". however , such long periods may not be the real and lie outside the coi in the wavelet .",
    "significant detection of naturally evolved periods in 50 - 90 s time - binned light curves are summarized in table 1 .",
    "it should also be noted that the epic - mos light curves of these different binnings also exhibit the similar periodicities .",
    "the observed harmonic periods ( 1261 and 687 s ) may be due to the impulsive generation of the slow mhd oscillations as a consequence of the flare energy release .",
    "the harmonic period of 687 s is only present during first 3 ks duration ( cf .",
    ", fig.2 ) which is likely to be an overtone that results from the initial impulsive excitation of the slow - mode wave , but damped out quickly than the fundamental period of 1261 s. observed oscillations may be excited in this loop due to the impulsive flare energy release and heating of the loops ( nakariakov et al . 2004 ; mendoza - bricno & erdlyi 2006 ; selwa et al .",
    "2007 ) . using the loop length of @xmath26 cm , phase speed of the fundamental mode mhd oscillations for a period of 1261 s",
    "is estimated to be 119 km s@xmath0 , which is sub - sonic in nature compared to the local sound speed ( 394 km s@xmath0 ) in the loop at average temperature of 7.2 mk during post - flare phase",
    ". however , the peak flare temperature of 33 mk corresponds to the local sound speed of 850 km s@xmath0 .",
    "this impulsive heating may initially trigger the slow oscillations , however , they span in the localized decay - phase where loop quickly cools down to be maintained at an average temperature of 7.2 mk .",
    "therefore , the detected periodicities could be due to the first two harmonics of the slow acoustic mhd oscillations in the coronal loops of proxima centauri . in the case of slow magnetoacoustic oscillations density of the loop",
    "is perturbed due to the spatial redistribution of the plasma along the background magnetic field , i.e. , the field - aligned movement of the plasma from one foot - point to the other in case of the fundamental mode , and from both the foot - point to the apex in the case of its first overtone ( kim et al .",
    "therefore , these mhd modes modulate the emissions of the plasma significantly . as",
    "the observed energy release is very powerful , the solar analogy suggests that it may also be a two - ribbon flare and the slow mode oscillations can be excited in a system of plasma arcades ( nakariakov & zimovets 2011 ; gruszecki & nakariakov 2011 ) .",
    "however , the arcade model instead of the loop model does not change the above mentioned conclusions as the observations do not have spatial resolution .",
    "such type of the oscillations have already been detected in the hot and flaring loops ( ofman & wang 2002 , nakariakov et al .",
    "2004 , kim et al .",
    "2012 ) , as well as in the comparatively cooler non - flaring loops ( srivastava & dwivedi 2010 ) in the solar corona .",
    "such oscillations show the strong nature of the damping most likely due to the thermal conduction ( ofman & wang 2002 ) . in the present case ,",
    "the fundamental mode of the oscillations shows strong damping . in the case of the fundamental mode wave - period ,",
    "the peak intensity decays upto its 1/e value in @xmath3250 min , which is the damping time of such oscillations .",
    "4 shows the variation of exponentially decaying harmonic function along with the detrended light curve .",
    "the function is described as    @xmath33    where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are amplitudes and phases corresponding to the the oscillatory period , @xmath36 ( 1261s and 687 s ) , respectively , and @xmath37 is the damping factor .",
    "the best fit of the function ( cf .",
    "4 ) gives @xmath37=0.45 , which indicates the damping time of 47 min .",
    "it is well fitted the noisy light curve that used in the detection of these two periodicities ( cf . ,",
    "the synthesized curve shows the damping period of 47 min , which is similar to the observed damping time of 50 min when the initial amplitude of oscillations decay to its 1/e value in the observational base - line ( cf .",
    ", top - panel of fig .",
    "2).the observed damping time is almost in agreement with the scaling laws between the observed wave period and decay time of such oscillations as reported in the variety of hot loops in solar corona as observed by sumer onboard soho ( ofman & wang 2002 ) .",
    "therefore , we may also conclude that the strong damping of such oscillations is due to the effect of thermal conduction in the loops of proxima centauri .",
    "we use the solar analogy to derive the plasma conditions of the corona of spatially un - resolved low mass flaring star proxima centauri ( e.g. , mcewan et al . , 2006 ;",
    "srivastava & dwivedi 2010 ; macnamara & roberts 2010 ; luna - cardozo et al .",
    "2012 , and references cited therein ) .",
    "the period ratio p@xmath3/p@xmath4 is derived to be 1.83 .",
    "the period ratio less than 2.0 is most likely due to the longitudinal density stratification of the stellar loops of the star in which such oscillations are excited .",
    "the effect of density stratification on the lowering of the period ratio of first two harmonics of slow acoustic oscillations has been only studied in the case of solar corona loops , which provides the most likely longitudinal density structuring of such loops ( e.g. , mcewan et al . , 2006 ;",
    "srivastava & dwivedi 2010 ; macnamara & roberts 2010 ; luna - cardozo et al .",
    "2012 , and references cited there ) .",
    "it should be noted that lowering of the period ratio of first two harmonics of slow waves only attributes to the density stratification .",
    "however , in the case of kink waves the period ratio can either be less than or greater than 2 implying that the density stratification and magnetic field divergence of the magnetic fluxtubes , respectively ( andries et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "the present observations provide the first clues about the longitudinal density structuring in the stellar flaring loops .",
    "therefore , such density or gravitational stratification should be considered in the future modelling of the stellar loops . using equation ( 24 ) of mcewan et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , half loop length of 3.75 @xmath110@xmath2 cm , and period ratio ( p@xmath3/2p@xmath4 ) of 0.915 , the density scale height of the stellar loop system is estimated as @xmath3222.6 mm . the density scale height is well below the hydrostatic scale height of such loops assuming the typical coronal temperature of few mega kelvin in proxima centauri during non - flaring state .",
    "this indicates the existence of non - equilibrium conditions there , e.g. , flows and mass structuring , which is very obvious in the dynamical coronae of such stars .",
    "for example , the hot gas motions have been seen in the optical and ultraviolet spectra of flaring m dwarfs denis 104814.7 - 395606.1 and cn leo ( fuhrmeister & schmitt 2004 , fuhrmeister et al .",
    "however , such physical scenarios are not well established in the case of the stellar coronae ( e.g. , gdel & naz 2010 ) .",
    "the heating due to the flaring activity either near the apex or near the footpoints of the loop can generate the various modes of the slow acoustic oscillations in magnetic loops ( nakariakov et al . 2004 ) , or in the loop - arcade systems in the flaring region ( nakariakov & zimovets 2011 ; gruszecki & nakariakov 2011 ) .",
    "random heating near the footpoint of these loops may also cause the excitation of the slow acoustic oscillations ( mendoza - briceo & erdlyi 2006 ) .",
    "taroyan and bradshaw ( 2008 ) have shown that the various harmonics of the slow - acoustic oscillations may be presented in the coronal loops maintained at the variety of temperatures , i.e. , hot as well as cool loops .",
    "later the harmonic periods have been observed in cool non - flaring loops as observed by srivastava & dwivedi ( 2010 ) .",
    "previously , the slow acoustic oscillations were only discovered in the hot sumer loops ( ofman & wang 2002 ) . however , the excitation conditions and typically the observations of such significant mhd modes are still under debate in the solar atmosphere .",
    "we present the first observational evidence of the harmonic periods ( 1261 and 687 ) of slow acoustic oscillations in flaring coronal loop system of proxima centauri .",
    "the observed shorter periodicity ( 687 s ) can be connected with the anharmonicity of the main periodicity ( 1261 s ) and therefore may not be associated with another mode of oscillations .",
    "the appearance of such oscillations are bursty and temporally localized in the post flare phase that may be generated due to the impulsive heating of the stellar loops of proxima centauri after the flare energy release .",
    "the fundamental mode oscillations show a strong decaying nature similar to the slow acoustic oscillations observed in the solar corona .",
    "therefore , it may also be caused most likely due to the thermal conduction ( ofman & wang 2002 ) .",
    "one additional interesting property is evident in form of the period - shift of the fundamental mode slow acoustic oscillations .",
    "the period is shifted towards higher values ( cf . , intensity wavelet of fig .  2 ) .",
    "this indicates the change in the local sound speed , which is the upper - bound of the phase speed of the detected slow magnetoacoustic oscillations in ideal plasma , as @xmath38}$]@xmath39}$ ] ( aschwanden 2004 ) .",
    "this means the local phase speed of slow acoustic oscillations will decrease with the shift of the period towards higher values upto the time domain of 90 min .",
    "this indicates that the local ambient temperature of the loops may be decreased due to the radiative cooling and can cause the dissipation of these oscillations ( e.g. , aschwanden 2004 ) .",
    "however , the radiative cooling may not have important role in dissipating the fast kink or sausage modes as typical time - scale of the radiative cooling ( 1 hr ) in solar - type of loops may be higher compared to the damping time of these modes as theorized in various reports ( morton & erdlyi 2009 ; ruderman 2011 ) .",
    "this may be the most plausible non - ideal effect that can also cause the damping of such oscillations .",
    "the period ratio p@xmath3/p@xmath4 is found to be 1.83 , which may be the most likely signature of density stratification in these stellar loops .",
    "the estimated density scale height is 22.6 mm that is well below the hydrostatic scale height of such loops .",
    "this indicates the presence of non - equilibrium conditions in its corona , i.e , mass structuring as well as the flows .",

    "<S> we present the first observational evidence of multiple slow acoustic oscillations in the post flaring loops of the corona of proxima centauri using xmm - newton observations . </S>",
    "<S> we find the signature of periodic oscillations localized in the decay phase of the flare in its soft ( 0.3 - 10.0 kev ) x - ray emissions . </S>",
    "<S> using the standard wavelet tool , we find the multiple periodicities of 1261 s and 687 s. these bursty oscillations persist for durations of 90 minutes and 50 minutes , respectively , for more than 4 cycles </S>",
    "<S> . the intensity oscillations with the period of 1261 s may be the signature of the fundamental mode of slow magnetoacoustic waves with the phase - speed of 119 km s@xmath0 in the loop of the length 7.5@xmath110@xmath2 cm heated initially to obtain the flare peak temperature of 33 mk and later cooled down in the decay phase maintained at the average temperature of 7.2 mk . </S>",
    "<S> the other period of 687 s may be associated with the first overtone of slow magnetoacoustic oscillations in the flaring loop . </S>",
    "<S> the fundamental mode oscillations show a dissipation with damping time of 47 min . the period ratio p@xmath3/p@xmath4 is found to be 1.83 indicating that such oscillations are most likely excited in longitudinal density stratified stellar loops . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the density scale height of stellar loop system as 22.6 mm , which is smaller than the hydrostatic scale height of the hot loop system , and implies the existence of non - equilibrium conditions . </S>"
