    "several recent observations indicate that even the low h  i column density @xmath0 absorption lines may not be primordial as were previously thought .",
    "high resolution observations by cowie ( 1995 ) , tytler ( 1995 ) and womble ( 1996 ) show that there are metal lines ( c  iv ) associated with @xmath0 absorption lines with as small h  i column density as @xmath11 @xmath7 at @xmath5 .",
    "the fraction of the @xmath0 lines with @xmath12 @xmath7 that are associated with metal lines is approximately @xmath13 at @xmath5 .",
    "the median abundance of lines with @xmath14 @xmath7 at @xmath5 , is found to be [ c / h ] @xmath15 .",
    "recently songaila and cowie ( 1996 ) have shown that the fraction of @xmath0 lines that are associated with metal lines , hereafter denoted as @xmath16 , could be higher , and they have also detected the other c  ii , s  iv , n  v absorption lines in hydrogen clouds with @xmath17 @xmath7 . in view of the dependence of observational sensitivity for detecting metal lines , the fraction @xmath16 represents only a lower limit for the fraction of @xmath0 lines associated with ` metals ' .",
    "another set of observations shows that at low redshifts a large fraction of @xmath0 absorption lines are associated with galaxies ( maloney 1992 ; morris 1993 ) .",
    "lanzetta ( 1995b , lbtw ) claimed that @xmath18 of the @xmath0 lines at @xmath4 arise in galactic halos .",
    "the observation of barcons ( 1995 ) in which they imaged a galaxy corresponding to an absorption line , is an evidence of such associations .",
    "it is , therefore , reasonable to assume that at least a fraction of the @xmath0 absorption lines arise in galactic halos , and this fraction is hereafter denoted as @xmath19 .    in the hierarchical model of structure formation",
    ", there is a continuum of halos of various masses and velocity dispersions . in this paper",
    ", we consider the hypothesis that the @xmath0 lines are produced in two populations of halos in this continuum  in ` minihalos ' of small velocity dispersions which have not cooled and formed stars , and in large galactic halos with stars and metals . based on this two - population model for qso absorbers , we attempt to explain @xmath16 in terms of @xmath19 by the relation @xmath20",
    ".    there are circumstantial evidences for such a two population scenario . in the column density distribution of @xmath0 lines , there is a break around @xmath21 @xmath7 ( see , e.g. , cristiani 1995 ) .",
    "petitjean ( 1993 ) have interpreted this break as being due to existence of two populations of @xmath0 lines ",
    "the lines with higher h  i column density being associated with strong metal lines and with galactic halos .",
    "recently , fernndez - soto et al . ( 1996 ) analyzed the two - point correlation of very weak c  iv absorption lines associated with high - redshift ( @xmath22 ) @xmath0 absorption systems .",
    "they found that high - redshift @xmath0 absorption systems traced by c  iv lines are clustered in redshift , as strongly as that expected for galaxies .",
    "this suggests that many @xmath0 absorbers even at high redshifts may arise in galaxies .",
    "our primary goal in this paper is therefore to determine whether these recent observations can be understood within the framework of a two - population model for @xmath0 absorption systems , including their redshift evolution in the context of hierarchical structure formation . in  2 , we present a model of @xmath0-absorbing gas confined in both mini and galactic halos and set the prescription for determining the number of absorption lines provided by various masses of halos . on the basis of the press - schechter mass function with various power spectra and cosmological parameters ,",
    "we then discuss the fraction of absorption lines in minihalos and in galactic halos by comparing with the recent keck observations in  3 . the simplified approach for modeling chemical evolution of halos",
    "is also presented to predict the evolution of the average metallicity associated with @xmath0 lines in redshift .",
    "the discussion and conclusions are finally drawn in  4 .",
    "we define minihalos as halos in which baryonic gas is entirely photoionized by the external uv background and the gas is stably confined in the gravitational field of the dark matter ( rees 1986 ; ikeuchi 1986 ) .",
    "in these minihalos , the gas does not go through extensive star formation because of suppression of radiative cooling by photoionization ( efstathiou 1992 ) .",
    "below , we will characterise the halos by their circular velocities @xmath9 , where the mass density of halos is dominated by extended dark matter with @xmath23 distribution .",
    "minihalos are therefore bounded by two scales of circular velocity , @xmath24 .",
    "the lower limit is set by the sound velocity of the photoionized intergalactic medium ( igm ) , which is @xmath25 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "halos with @xmath9 less than this value will not have baryonic gas infall from the igm .",
    "this is basically the jeans mass , below which the perturbation in baryonic gas is suppressed .",
    "we take a characteristic value of @xmath26 km  s@xmath2 for the photoionized igm with @xmath27 k.    the upper limit @xmath28 is admittedly less certain .",
    "recent numerical simulations show that photoionization severely inhibits the formation of galaxies with @xmath29 km  s@xmath2 , and substantially decreases the mass of cooled baryons in halos with @xmath30 km  s@xmath2 ( thoul and weinberg 1996 ) .",
    "they also find that above @xmath31 km  s@xmath2 photoionization of the igm does not have any significant effect .",
    "for the reasons described in the next subsection , we will use a canonical value of @xmath32 km  s@xmath2 and examine the effect of changing @xmath28 over its possible range .",
    "in fact , we later ask the question whether or not one can _ determine _ the value of @xmath28 from the observations . in brief , then , we assume that halos with @xmath33 km  s@xmath2 do not undergo vigorous star formation , and call them minihalos in this paper .",
    "we will call the halos with circular velocity larger than @xmath28 , the galactic halos .",
    "our results are not sensitive to the upper limit of the circular velocity for galactic halos , and we will use a value of @xmath34 km  s@xmath2 as an upper limit .",
    "below , we will associate these halos with @xmath0 lines which have corresponding metal lines .",
    "it is true that the division of halos into the above categories of mini and galactic halos is rather ad hoc .",
    "however , it is most likely to be close to the real picture for the above mentioned reasons .    for the gas associated in galactic halos , the virial temperature @xmath35 for @xmath36 km",
    "s@xmath2 is above @xmath37 k [ @xmath38 k ] , where the mean molecular weight is taken as 0.59 for a totally ionized gas . in this temperature range ,",
    "any local disturbances in the hot gas may be thermally unstable , because the radiative cooling rate increases with decreasing @xmath35 .",
    "we therefore assume that the instability promotes the development of a two - phase structure in the gas ( fall & rees 1985 ) , so that it is the cool gas clouds , being pressure - confined by the surrounding hot gas , that produce @xmath0 absorptions , as proposed by mo ( 1994 ) . in this work",
    ", we will be concerned with @xmath0 lines with low hi column density as @xmath39 @xmath7 , in which the shielding against the uv background radiation is ineffective .",
    "the internal density of clouds in the outer parts of halos that give rise to such lines is low enough to be photoionized by the uv background radiation .",
    "we thus assume the gas in clouds to be in photoionization equilibrium , where the gaseous temperature is expected to be order of @xmath40 k , and therefore consistent with the observed doppler parameters of @xmath0 lines ( see , e.g. , maloney 1992 ; rauch et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "note that , even the gas in disks , if disks are formed , will be ionized by the uv radiation in the outer parts , beyond the observed sharp edge at @xmath41 @xmath7 ( maloney 1992 ) .",
    "the galaxies at low redshift imaged by barcons ( 1995 ) are inferred to give rise to absorption lines at an impact parameters of @xmath42 kpc , where @xmath43 km  s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 .",
    "the gas which is responsible for such absorption lines is certainly ionized by the uv background radiation ( see also , morris 1993 ; salpeter and hoffmann 1995 ) .",
    "we assume that the density profile of both mini and galactic halos is represented by that of a softened isothermal sphere , @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the central density and @xmath46 is the core radius .",
    "the baryonic gas amounts to a fraction @xmath47 of the total mass of the halo .",
    "then , the circular velocity @xmath48 at @xmath49 can be written as , @xmath50 where @xmath51 .",
    "this functional form of @xmath48 assures a nearly flat rotation curve at large radii @xmath52 . in what follows",
    ", the circular velocity is characterised by its value at the virial radius of the halo , @xmath53 ( see below for an explanation of @xmath53 ) . then , substituting eq.(2 ) into eq.(1 ) and introducing @xmath54 , the density profile of a halo that includes both baryonic gas and dark matter is re - written as , @xmath55 where @xmath9 is the circular velocity at @xmath56 .",
    "we model the gas in minihalos ( @xmath57 ) to be in photoionized equilibrium with the external uv background radiation .",
    "we write the intensity of the uv background radiation at the lyman limit as @xmath58 erg @xmath7 s@xmath2 sr@xmath2 hz@xmath2 . using the ionization and recombination rates for a fiducial uv spectrum of @xmath59 ( black 1981 ) , the h  i number density @xmath60 in minihalos",
    "is written as , @xmath61 where @xmath62 for hydrogen and @xmath63 is the recombination rate coefficient ( black 1981 ) .",

    "the h  i number density @xmath60 is then written as @xmath72 the cloud radius @xmath73 for the mass of each cloud @xmath74 is @xmath75 each cloud produces the h  i column density as @xmath76 . in order to obtain the h  i column density observed at an impact parameter @xmath64 from the galactic center , it is required to know the spatial distribution of clouds in halos _ a priori_. without going into details for modeling this , we assume that the clouds have roughly unit covering factor in halos when projected onto the sky , and that each sightline encounters only one cloud in average , which is not in disagreement with the observational results ( morris et al .",
    "1993 ; lbtw ) . then",
    ", as we argue in the appendix , the average h  i column density observed at an impact parameter @xmath64 is well approximated by @xmath77 .",
    "we thus obtain from eq.(6 ) and ( 7 ) @xmath78^{5/3 } } \\quad { \\rm cm}^{-2 }   \\quad { \\rm for\\ galactic\\ halos } \\ > ,     % % & ( 8)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we assume the virial temperature for @xmath35 of the hot gas .",
    "we note that both expressions for @xmath79 given in eq.(5 ) and ( 8) are approximately connected continuously at the canonical value of @xmath80 km  s@xmath2 for @xmath28 , corresponding to the virial temperature of @xmath81 k ; this is the temperature of hot gas below which the picture of a two - phase structure in the gas becomes invalid .",
    "we therefore use eq.(5 ) for @xmath82 km  s@xmath2 and eq.(8 ) for @xmath83 km  s@xmath2 in the following .    according to several determinations of the intensity of the uv background radiation ( e.g. madau 1992 ) ,",
    "@xmath84 is nearly constant at high redshifts @xmath85 , whereas at low redshifts @xmath86 it rapidly decreases with decreasing redshift .",
    "we adopt the following functional form for @xmath84 , @xmath87 where the index @xmath88 quantifies the decreasing rate of @xmath84 for @xmath89 .    to estimate the value of @xmath90 in eq.(3 ) , we use the theory of the spherical collapse of cosmological density perturbations , that yields @xmath91 for the einstein - de sitter ( eds ) universe ( e.g. peebles 1980 ; padmanabhan 1993 ) .",
    "this allows us to derive @xmath92 using the observed values of @xmath9 and @xmath46 of the present - day dark matter halos at @xmath93 . for this purpose , it is convenient to use dark - matter dominated dwarf spirals ( moore 1994 ) , where the dynamical effect of a luminous component on the observed rotation curve is sufficiently small , so that one can accurately determine the structural parameters of dark halos . adopting the values of @xmath9 and @xmath46 from moore ( 1994 ) for dwarf spirals of ddo154 , ddo170 , ddo105 and ngc3109 , we obtain @xmath94 for the eds universe with @xmath95 . in",
    "what follows , we assume @xmath96 , since the following results in the concerned low - column density range of @xmath97 @xmath7 are quite insensitive to the values of @xmath92 as long as @xmath98 .",
    "figure 1(a ) shows the impact parameter @xmath64 _ vs. _ the total mass of halos @xmath99 at @xmath100 , where we take @xmath101 k for the gas in minihalos ( eq.5 ) , @xmath102 k and @xmath103 for the clouds in galactic halos ( eq.8 ) , with the common parameters of @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 .",

    "this is because @xmath109 in eq.(5 ) while @xmath110 in eq.(8 ) for @xmath111 .",
    "here we note that the discontinuities at the boundary of both regimes ( at @xmath80 km  s@xmath2 ) are quite small in @xmath64 so that these will not affect the later results .",

    "since these galaxies experienced the burst of star formation and the subsequent gas loss via galactic wind for only a short period of @xmath136 gyr ( see e.g. yoshii & arimoto 1987 ) , the probability of a sightline to pass the protogalactic , gas - rich stage of these galaxies may be small . to evaluate @xmath135",
    ", we adopt the nominal fraction 69% of late - type galaxies among all types derived by postman and geller ( 1984 ) and assume it to be constant with @xmath137 for simplicity .",

    "solid lines correspond to a ` standard ' eds universe ( @xmath152 , @xmath153 ) , while dotted lines to a low - density ( @xmath154 ) , flat ( @xmath146 ) universe .",
    "it is found , as was already argued by mo et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , that there are two stages in the evolution of the number density .",
    "first , the rapid formation of minihalos inherent in the cdm models gives rise to the abundant of @xmath0 lines at @xmath155 , and second , at lower redshifts of @xmath156 , the number of @xmath0 lines decreases with time as the hierarchical mergings proceed  small - sized , less - massive objects disappear by being incorporated into larger , more massive objects .",
    "the rapid decrease of @xmath141 with decreasing @xmath137 is now an observationally established fact , first recognized by peterson ( 1978 ) . for the cases of large @xmath130 and non - zero @xmath147 ,",
    "the maximum value of @xmath141 is reduced and the epoch at which it is realized is delayed .",
    "this is because the growth of density perturbations and subsequent mergings are suppressed due to the bias in galaxy formation and the rapid expansion of the universe .",
    "however , the effects of these different assumptions on model parameters appear to be almost indistinguishable at the second stage of the number evolution of @xmath0 lines .",
    "this indicates that probing world models by @xmath141 of absorption systems in the observed redshift region of @xmath157 may not be useful in view of some model uncertainties .",
    "we note here that numerical simulations with a variety of world models have shown almost similar h  i column density distribution for @xmath0 lines ( miralda - escud 1995 ; hernquist 1995 ) .",
    "also plotted in the figure as filled squares are the observed numbers of @xmath0 lines at @xmath5 ( petijean et al .",

    "1991 ) , and @xmath159 ( bahcall et al . 1993 ) .",
    "it is clear that the models with @xmath160 at @xmath161 are reasonably in agreement with the observed values in the corresponding range of redshifts , whereas the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst )",
    "result of the unexpectedly large number of low - redshift @xmath0 lines ( bahcall et al . 1993 ) , compared to the extrapolated value from high @xmath137 , can be explained if the uv flux is decreasing with time ( mo et al . 1993 ) .",
    "we find that @xmath162^\\alpha$ ] with @xmath163 fits well .",
    "it is interesting to note that with such a redshift evolution , the current uv flux is @xmath164 , which is consistent with the observations of maloney ( 1992 ) and kulkarni and fall ( 1993 ) .",
    "the dependence of @xmath141 on the column density @xmath79 is shown in fig.2(b ) , where filled squares are taken from rauch et al .",
    "( 1992 ) for @xmath165 .",
    "the observed power - law decline of the @xmath0 lines , @xmath166 , is well reproduced by the model on the basis of the isothermal density profile of minihalos ( rees 1986 ) , together with the current model of pressure - confined clouds in galactic halos .",
    "we remark that this is the case as long as the effect of self - shielding against the external uv radiation is neglected .",
    "the effect , leaving a cooled neutral core in the inner part of a sphere ( e.g. chiba & nath 1994 ) , is realized at the high column - density ends of @xmath167 @xmath7 .",
    "this effect is thus unimportant in the present study of low column - density @xmath0 lines of @xmath168 @xmath7 that occur at the large impact parameters of sightlines ( fig.1 ) .",
    "we now investigate what fraction of @xmath0 lines can be associated with galactic halos where production of metals is possible  the fraction @xmath19 which may be compared to that of @xmath0 lines associated with metal lines , @xmath16 .",
    "figure 3(a ) shows the evolution of the galactic fraction @xmath19 of @xmath0 lines with @xmath169 @xmath7 , where we assume @xmath170 km  s@xmath2 as the boundary value of @xmath9 between minihalos and galactic halos .",
    "it is found that initially at high redshifts ( @xmath171 ) , most of @xmath0 lines are provided by minihalos that collapsed early for the cdm - type power spectrum of density perturbations .",
    "this leads to the small values of @xmath19 less than 0.2 .",

    "there are no observational support yet for the above behaviour of @xmath19 with @xmath79 and will be a test for the two population model .",
    "recently , songaila and cowie ( 1996 ) claim that @xmath180 for @xmath181 @xmath7 and @xmath177 for @xmath182 @xmath7 , whereas the other observations give a much lower value of @xmath16 .",
    "more observations are needed to settle this issue ( see also discussion ) .    as we mentioned in  2 , the exact value of @xmath28 , which separates the range of circular velocities into those of minihalos and galactic halos , is yet to be settled from theoretical points of view .",
    "for example ,",
    "even for @xmath1 km  s@xmath2 where the virial temperature is @xmath183 k , some fraction of gas in an inner part of minihalos may be able to cool and form stars , because of self - shielding effects against the external uv background radiation .",
    "we thus turn the argument and address the question , as to which range of @xmath28 is allowed in the light of the keck results .",
    "figure 4 shows the galactic fraction of @xmath0 lines as a function of @xmath28 , while @xmath184 km  s@xmath2 and @xmath185 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "here we note that the change of @xmath28 is applied to the range of integration in eq.(12 ) and the definition of @xmath135 in eq.(13 ) , whereas the range of @xmath9 for the expressions of @xmath79 ( @xmath82 km  s@xmath2 for eq.5 and @xmath83 km  s@xmath2 for eq.8 ) is unchanged on the theoretical grounds .",
    "for the observed fraction of @xmath186 , the possible value of @xmath28 to reproduce it is 40 to 60 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "this is rather insensitive to the specific assumptions on the bias parameter @xmath130 , cosmological parameters ( @xmath187 ) , and the limiting circular velocities ( @xmath188 ) .",
    "however , to set a more robust constraint on the range of circular velocities or masses for mini / galactic halos , further observational determinations of the fraction of @xmath0 lines associated with metal lines are needed .",
    "several recent observations have also measured the metal abundances of absorption lines at high redshifts ( cowie et al .",
    "1995 ; womble et al .",
    "the presence of heavy elements implies that interstellar gas confined in dark halos has been processed by star formation and subsequent chemical evolution .",
    "while there are some alternative possibilities for enriching gas  one representative idea is that igm as a whole has already been processed on a sub - galactic scale _ prior to _ formation of collapsed galactic halos ( songaila & cowie 1996 ) , we present here the hypothesis that enrichment occurs _",
    "after _ halo formation .",
    "we postulate that gas within halos has been cooled quickly enough to fragment into stars , and being enriched . in our model , this is applied to the gas in galactic - sized halos with @xmath189 , where cooling time is well less than dynamical time ( dekel & silk 1986 ; efstathiou 1992 ) . here , we attempt to estimate the possible metal abundances of gas in these halos .",
    "suppose that a halo with @xmath9 at the redshift @xmath137 is enriched with an average metallicity @xmath190 . here",
    "the dependences on @xmath9 and @xmath137 arise from the fact that the halos with different @xmath9 collapse and form at different epochs , say @xmath191 , leading to different epochs of star formation , say @xmath192 , and that the subsequent chemical evolution starting at @xmath192 yields the metals at the redshift @xmath137 .",
    "thus an ensemble of these halos with the metallicity @xmath190 contribute to the metal abundance of @xmath0 lines . then since the probability for a sightline to encounter galactic halos in the velocity range of @xmath189 is given by eq.(12 ) , we arrive at the average metallicity of @xmath0 lines with h  i column density larger than @xmath79 : @xmath193    the actual expression for @xmath190 in each halo is admittedly not straightforward to derive and very model - dependent .",
    "physics involved in it are , e.g. merging history of a population of dark halos , gasdynamical and thermal processes of gas confined in these halos , and history of star formation . while the extensive and sophisticated approaches of incorporating these processes exist ( lacey & cole 1993 ; kauffmann et al .",
    "1993 ) , we adopt a more simplified approach which we believe includes the essential properties of the system to deduce the characteristic values of metal abundance .",
    "first , we assume that the formation redshift @xmath191 of the halo with mass @xmath99 is represented by the collapse epoch of a rms , 1  @xmath194 linear density contrast , i.e. , if @xmath195 denotes the growth rate of density perturbation , @xmath191 is derived from @xmath196 , where @xmath99 is related to @xmath9 from eq.(10 ) . according to lacey & cole ( 1993 ) on the basis of their extensive analysis of merging halos",
    ", this scaling relation appears to hold for the typical formation epoch of the _ main parent _ halo which had half or more of the present mass @xmath99 ( see their fig.9 and fig.10 ) .",
    "realistically the halo formation epoch for a given @xmath99 is distributed with some probability arising from different amplitudes of density perturbations , but it can be characterised by the collapse epoch of a typical , 1  @xmath194 perturbation .",
    "second , gas in a virialized , galactic - sized halo must cool quickly ( within a dynamical time ) to ensure star formation , so that @xmath192 , the epoch of star formation , is assumed to be equal to @xmath191 .",
    "this is reasonable , because the cooling time in the galactic scales is less than @xmath197 yr , which is a negligible time span  much less than the hubble time  in the cosmological context .",
    "third , concerning the subsequent chemical evolution , we adopt the observed age - metallicity relation of metal - poor halo stars in our galaxy ( schuster & nissen 1989 ) , on the grounds that typical sightlines to produce the @xmath0 lines with low h  i column density penetrate the halo gas , from which old halo stars may have formed .",
    "the average enrichment rate @xmath198 derived by schuster & nissen ( 1989 ) is of the order of @xmath199 gyr@xmath2 for their sample of halo stars .",
    "this value is also close to the value from the chemical - evolution model of the halo by pagel ( 1989 ) .",
    "therefore , denoting the age of the universe at the redshift @xmath137 is @xmath200 , the metallicity @xmath201 at @xmath137 is derived as , @xmath202 where following the above arguments , the epoch of star formation , @xmath203 , depends on @xmath9 and @xmath137 .",
    "we assume here that at the outer parts of the halo , which concerns us here for the @xmath0 forest lines , the gradient of metallcitiy is negligible .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption because there are indications that star formation in the outer halo of our galaxy has been slow and , therefore , the chemical evolution ( matteucci and franois 1992 ) .",
    "if the variation in star formation rate is caused by the variation in the gas collapse time , then this variation is expected to be small in the outer regions of the halo .",
    "this assumption is consistent with the observation that the average metallicity is almost constant for @xmath0 lines with @xmath97 @xmath7 ( cowie 1995 , songaila and cowie 1996 ) .",
    "figure 5(a ) shows the evolution of the mean abundance for absorption lines with @xmath204 @xmath7 ( solid and dotted lines ) .",
    "it is found that for @xmath205 , the metal abundance significantly increases by more than two orders of magnitude . at @xmath175 ,",
    "it is approximately in agreement with the keck results of [ c / h]@xmath206 .",
    "we remark that the adopted age - metallicity relation of a constant enrichment rate overestimates the halo abundance at @xmath4 : the relation should be applied to stars with metallicity less than @xmath207 of solar , which is the criterion to separate halos stars from disk stars ( schuster & nissen 1989 ) . the subsequent formation of halo stars",
    "is stopped , and most of the enriched halo gas would fall into the disk  the hypothesis supported for solving the so - called g - dwarf problem in the solar neighborhood ( e.g. yoshii et al .",
    "thus we assume @xmath208 as an upper limit for abundance of absorption lines in fig.5(a ) , but this does not change our result in the light of the keck results at @xmath209 .",
    "we have also investigated the case when the epoch of star formation @xmath210 is constant , being independent of the mass scale of halos  as was done by timmes et al .",
    "( 1995 ) for damped @xmath0 systems .",
    "we find that the evolution of @xmath211 based on our prescription of star formation beginning at the collapse epoch of 1 @xmath194 density contrasts is essentially the same as the case when @xmath212 gyr .    also shown in fig.5(a ) with filled circles",
    "are the recent findings of lu , sargent & barlow ( 1996 ) for the abundances ( [ fe / h ] ) of damped @xmath0 systems observed with the keck .",
    "intriguingly , the median values of abundances in such systems are well reproduced by the current models .",
    "this may support the hypothesis , first proposed by lanzetta , wolfe & turnshek ( 1995a ) , that damped @xmath0 systems could represent a spheroidal component of galaxies ( see discussion in  4.2 ) .",
    "the dependence of @xmath211 on the value of @xmath28 is shown in fig.5(b ) .",
    "in contrast with the galactic fraction @xmath19 of @xmath0 lines , @xmath211 turns out to be sensitive to both the bias parameter @xmath130 and the cosmological parameters ( @xmath187 ) at large values of @xmath28 .",
    "it is systematically lower for a larger bias and/or lower - density universe .",
    "this is caused by delayed star - formation epoch @xmath210 , leading to less time for enriching gas .",
    "we have shown that the observed fraction of @xmath0 absorption lines associated with metal lines can be understood in terms of photoionized gas confined in galactic - sized halos with @xmath213 km  s@xmath2 , whose number density follows the press - schechter model of hierarchical structure formation . the derived average abundance of heavy elements in absorption systems , combined with the characteristic epochs of star formation and the observed age - metallicity relation in our galactic halo , appears to be reasonably in agreement with the observed abundance at @xmath214 .",
    "the current model also suggests that both the fraction of @xmath0 lines associated with galactic halos and the metallicity in absorption systems are expected to increase with decreasing redshift ( fig.3a and fig.5a ) .",
    "while the explicit dependences of these quantities on redshift are yet to be settled ( see songaila & cowie 1996 ) , we note the findings of steidel ( 1990 ) that the number density of c  iv lines increases with decreasing redshift . in our model , this can be explained from the above predicted properties of absorption systems in the following way .    in photoionization equilibrium ,",
    "the ratio between the column densities of c  iv and h  i is a function of the ionization parameter @xmath215 , which is the ratio of the densities of ionizing photons and particles , and of the metallicity @xmath201 ; using the photoionization code of cloudy ( ferland 1993 ) , we find that for @xmath216 to @xmath217 , and for @xmath218 to 0.5 , the ratio @xmath219 is well described as , @xmath220 then , suppose that the number density of @xmath0 lines per unit h  i column density and redshift , @xmath221 , is represented by a power law form , @xmath222 where @xmath223 ( sargent et al . 1989 ) and @xmath224 ( lu et al .",
    "1991 ) , and that a fraction @xmath19 of these @xmath0 lines are associated with c  iv lines , which may be written as , @xmath225 from fig .",
    "3(a ) , we obtain @xmath226 at @xmath209 .",
    "suppose also that the mean metallicity of absorption lines increases in time following @xmath227 .",
    "then eq.(17 ) and eq.(18 ) give the column density distribution of c  iv lines as , @xmath228 where @xmath229 describes the redshift evolution of c  iv lines .",
    "it is known from observations that the @xmath230 index is the same for both h  i and c  iv lines ( cowie et al .",
    "1995 ; bergeron et al .",
    "1994 ) , indicating that the simple equation ( 17 ) holds well .",
    "steidel ( 1990 ) has shown that the index @xmath231 is negative , of order @xmath232 .",
    "this means that the number of c  iv lines increases in time . in our model",
    ", this can be due partly to the increase of the galactic fraction @xmath19 in time and to the increase of the metallicity @xmath211 in time .",
    "then , for the set of power - law indices , @xmath233 , @xmath234 , @xmath235 , and @xmath236 , we arrive at @xmath237 , thereby indicating , @xmath238 it is worth noting that the enrichment rate of absorption lines shown in fig.5(a ) is well approximated by this equation .",
    "the redshift evolution for c  iv lines used here is , strictly speaking , for high c  iv column density lines",
    ". it will be interesting to see whether observations in the near future show a similar redshift evolution for small c  iv column density lines .    therefore , the derived redshift evolutions of both the fraction of @xmath0 lines associated with galactic halos ( fig.3a ) and the metallicity in absorption systems ( fig.5a ) are approximately consistent with the observed scaling laws for @xmath0 and c  iv lines .",
    "the abundances of metals have also been measured in damped @xmath0 systems , which are believed to be protogalaxies .",
    "smith et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and pettini et al .",
    "( 1995 ) have recently reported , by measuring the zn lines as a probe of metallicity , that the typical zn abundance at @xmath239 is @xmath240 of solar , but there is a considerable scatter in the zn abundance , spanning more than two orders of magnitude . using high quality spectra obtained with the keck telescope , lu , sargent & barlow ( 1996 ) have also derived a large scatter of abundances , about a factor of 30 , with @xmath79-weighted mean abundance of 0.028 solar between @xmath241 . in the context of the present model",
    ", such a large scatter may be caused by the different formation epoch of halos , @xmath191 , for a given mass arising from the different amplitudes of primordial density fluctuations and different merging history ( lacey & cole 1993 ) .",
    "also , for the adopted age - metallicity relationship of halo stars , there is a scatter in the ages of the stars of @xmath242 gyr at a given abundance , leading to a scatter of abundances more than an order of magnitude at a given age ( schuster & nissen 1989 ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the evolution of the mean abundance is reproduced from the formation epoch of a typical 1 @xmath194 fluctuation and the mean age - metallicity relationship of halo stars in our galaxy ( fig.5a ) .",
    "this suggests that damped @xmath0 systems represent a metal - poor halo component .",
    "also , songaila and cowie ( 1996 ) found that the ratio si / c is about three times solar , similar to the abundance ratio of galactic halo stars .",
    "the two population model , as presented here , clearly predicts ( a ) the fraction of @xmath0 lines with associated metal lines as a function of redshift and ( b ) the redshift evolution of the average metallicity .",
    "the observations , however , have not yet converged to any firm conclusion and it is too early to rule out other possibilities . as noted in songaila and cowie ( 1996 ) , it will be very difficult to determine the fraction of metal enriched @xmath0 clouds below @xmath243 @xmath7 , because this will mean a sensitivity limit of @xmath244 @xmath7 , which is difficult at present .",
    "they claim to have found associated c  iv lines in @xmath245 of clouds with @xmath181 @xmath7 and @xmath246 of clouds with @xmath182 @xmath7 . if confirmed , such a large fraction of enriched clouds will be difficult to explain with the two population model . as emphasized by songaila and cowie ( 1996 ) , the alternative hypothesis of an enriched igm",
    "will then be more appropriate .",
    "we briefly note here that a problem also prevails at low redshifts about the interpretation of the fraction of @xmath0 lines with associated metal lines .",
    "although the association of some of the low column density @xmath0 lines with galaxies seems sure , it is still uncertain as to how physical the association is ( see le brun 1996 for a discussion ) .",
    "it is possible that instead of being directly associated with galactic halos ( as in , for example , mo and morris 1994 ) , the @xmath0 lines trace some structure related to formation of galaxies ( morris and van den bergh 1994 , petitjean 1995 ) .",
    "we note here the possibility , as shown in several recent numerical simulations ( miralda - escud 1995 , hernquist 1995 ) that very low column density @xmath0 lines may arise in mini pancakes and not minihalos . in this case",
    ", the density profile will be much different and our results may not hold .",
    "however , we note that mini pancakes can account for @xmath0 lines with @xmath243 @xmath7 ( miralda - escud 1995 ) and lines with higher h  i column density come from the intersecting points of pancakes , and correspond to minihalos or galactic halos of our model . therefore , our results are most certain to hold for @xmath247 @xmath7 . in any case , as explained above , the fraction of @xmath0 lines with associated metal lines for @xmath243 @xmath7 will be difficult to determine in the near future , and our model will not be testable for such values of h  i column densities .",
    "incidentally , the case for an enriched igm was described by silk ( 1987 ) much before the discovery of associated metal lines in @xmath0 systems .",
    "they discussed the possibility of enriching the igm by galactic winds from dwarf galaxies .",
    "the detail of such a scenario , however , remains to be worked out .",
    "pregalactic objects such as population iii stars might also enrich the igm at high redshifts , but again no detail models exist .    in the face of such interesting but still poorly understood scenarios",
    ", it therefore seems reasonable to pursue a modified version of the minihalo model , such as the two population model presented here .",
    "we have shown that a fraction of @xmath13 of @xmath0 forest lines with associated metal lines can be understood in the framework of hierarchical structure formation model , assuming that halos with velocity dispersion @xmath248 km / s do not produce stars and heavy elements .",
    "the model predicts that the fraction of clouds with associated metal lines increases slowly with the h  i column density .",
    "we have shown that the results are robust and do not depend strongly on the assumptions of the limiting values of velocity dispersion .",
    "we have further used the age - metallicity relation of galactic halo stars to predict the evolution of the average metallicity of the associated metal line systems . in particular , we find that the average metallicity at @xmath239 should be about a hundredth of solar .",
    "we thank t.  padmanabhan , r.  srianand , and e.  j.  wampler for stimulating discussions and helpful comments .",
    "we are also grateful to the referee for his constructive suggestions for the improvement of this paper .",
    "this work has been supported in part by the grand - in - aid for scientific research ( 08640318 ) of the ministry of education , science , and culture in japan .",
    "we describe below how to obtain the h  i column density as a function of the impact parameter @xmath64 for @xmath0-absorbing gas clouds in galactic halos .",
    "the probability @xmath249 that a sightline in the range of @xmath250 encounters the clouds confined in the ambient hot gas is given as @xmath251 , where @xmath252 is the number density of clouds and @xmath253 is the cross section of each cloud .",
    "under the assumption that each sightline encounters one cloud in average , @xmath254 is normalized as @xmath255 .",
    "then , if each cloud has its own column density @xmath256 as a function of the galactocentric distance @xmath49 , the average column density @xmath257 at the impact parameter @xmath64 may be written as , @xmath258    to obtain the possible expression for @xmath252 , we assume that the whole area of a galactic halo projected onto the sky is in average covered by ensemble of clouds without overlapping .",
    "this is equivalent to @xmath255 as described above .",
    "then , the average number density of clouds within @xmath64 , denoted as @xmath259 , may be approximately given as @xmath260 , and this yields the number density @xmath252 at each @xmath64 as @xmath261 .",
    "equation ( a1 ) is then reduced to @xmath262    here we note that @xmath263 at @xmath52 where h  i column densities of @xmath0 absorption lines are lower than @xmath264 @xmath7 in galactic halos . substituting this into eq.(a2 ) , we obtain @xmath265 where we introduce the variable @xmath266 by @xmath267 in the second equation .",
    "the integration in eq.(a3 ) yields 0.91 , and this can be regarded as @xmath268 in view of the other uncertainties .",
    "this allows us to adopt the approximate equality as @xmath269 .",

    "<S> we investigate the hypothesis that @xmath0 absorption lines arise in two populations of halos  minihalos of small circular velocity ( @xmath1 km  s@xmath2 ) in which star formation and metal production are inhibited by photoionization of the uv background radiation , and large galactic halos ( @xmath3 km  s@xmath2 ) which possess stars and metals . </S>",
    "<S> based on the model of @xmath0-absorbing gas confined in both populations of halos , we attempt to explain the recent observations of ( 1 ) associations of visible galaxies with @xmath0 lines at low redshifts @xmath4 , and ( 2 ) metal lines associated with a non - negligible fraction of low h  i column density @xmath0 lines at @xmath5 . for galactic halos , we find that photoionized gas clouds confined in the pressure of ambient hot gas can produce @xmath0 absorptions with h  i column density as low as @xmath6 @xmath7 , and that the impact parameter of a sightline for such absorptions matches well with the observed radius of gaseous envelope in a typical luminous galaxy . using the press - schechter prescription for the mass function of halos </S>",
    "<S> , we also show that the fraction of @xmath0 lines with associated metal lines can be understood in terms of the fraction of @xmath0 absorbers that are associated with galactic halos . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the reported fraction of @xmath8 at @xmath5 is reproduced when the boundary value of @xmath9 to separate mini or galactic halos is @xmath10 km  s@xmath2 , which is consistent with the theoretical prediction of galaxy formation under photoionization . </S>",
    "<S> the average metallicity of both @xmath0 forest and damped @xmath0 systems at @xmath5 is explained in terms of the model of halo - formation history combined with the age - metallicity relationship of galactic halo stars . </S>",
    "<S> possible methods to test this hypothesis and the other alternative scenarios are also discussed .    </S>",
