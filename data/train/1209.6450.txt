    "two new charged bottomonium - like resonances , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , have recently been observed by the belle collaboration in decays of @xmath14 to five different final states : @xmath17 , @xmath9 and @xmath18 , @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the quark composition of the initial and final states allows to assert that these hadronic objects are the first examples of states of an exotic nature : @xmath19 should be comprised of ( at least ) four quarks .",
    "several models have been proposed to describe the internal structure of these states .",
    "one suggests  @xcite that @xmath15 and @xmath16 states might be a loosely bound @xmath20 and @xmath21 systems , respectively .",
    "the proximity of the @xmath15 and @xmath16 masses to those of the sum of the @xmath22 and @xmath23 mesons and the sum of the two @xmath23 mesons , respectively , supports this hypothesis . in this case",
    ", it would be natural to expect that the @xmath24 and @xmath25 states decay respectively to @xmath20 and @xmath21 final states with substantial rates .",
    "evidence for the three - body @xmath26 decay has been previously reported by belle in ref .",
    "@xcite with a data sample of @xmath27  fb@xmath13 . in this analysis",
    "we use @xmath12  fb@xmath13 of data accumulated by the belle detector at a center - of - mass ( c.m . )",
    "energy near the @xmath14 to study three - body @xmath28^{\\pm}\\pi^{\\mp}$ ] decays and to search for @xmath29^{\\pm}\\pi^{\\mp}$ ] decays .",
    "note that we reconstruct only three - body @xmath30 combinations with a charged primary pion . for brevity",
    ", we adopt the following notations : the sum of @xmath31 and @xmath32 final states is referred to as @xmath33 ; the combination of @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 final states is referred to as @xmath38 and the sum of @xmath39 and @xmath40 final states is denoted as @xmath41 .",
    "the belle detector  @xcite is located at the single interaction point of kekb  @xcite , an asymmetric energy double storage ring collider .",
    "the detector is a large - solid - angle magnetic spectrometer based on a 1.5  t superconducting solenoid magnet .",
    "charged particle tracking is provided by a four - layer silicon vertex detector and a 50-layer central drift chamber ( cdc ) that surround the interaction point .",
    "the charged particle acceptance covers laboratory polar angles between @xmath42 and @xmath43 , corresponding to about",
    "92% of the total solid angle in the c.m .  frame .",
    "charged hadron identification is provided by @xmath44 measurements in the cdc , an array of 1188 aerogel cherenkov counters ( acc ) , and a barrel - like array of 128 time - of - flight scintillation counters ( tof ) ; information from the three subdetectors is combined to form a single likelihood ratio , which is then used in kaon and pion selection .",
    "electromagnetic showering particles are detected in an array of 8736 csi(tl ) crystals ( ecl ) that covers the same solid angle as the charged particle tracking system .",
    "electron identification in belle is based on a combination of @xmath44 measurements in the cdc , the response of the acc , and the position , shape and total energy deposition ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath45 ) of the shower detected in the ecl .",
    "the magnetic field is returned via an iron yoke that is instrumented to detect muons and @xmath46 mesons .",
    "we use a geant - based monte carlo ( mc ) simulation to model the response of the detector and determine its acceptance  @xcite .",
    "the dominant background comes from @xmath47 continuum events where real @xmath48 mesons produced in @xmath49 annihilation are combined with random particles to form a @xmath22 candidate .",
    "this type of background is suppressed using variables that characterize the event topology . since the momenta of two @xmath22 mesons produced from a three - body @xmath14 decay are low in the c.m .",
    "frame , their decay products are essentially uncorrelated and the event tends to be spherical .",
    "in contrast , hadrons from continuum events tend to exhibit a two - jet structure .",
    "we use @xmath50 , the angle between the thrust axis of the @xmath22 candidate and that of the rest of the event , to discriminate between the two cases .",
    "the distribution of @xmath51 is strongly peaked near @xmath52 for @xmath53 events and is nearly flat for @xmath54 events .",
    "we require @xmath55 for @xmath56 final states ; this eliminates about 81% of the continuum background and retains 73% of the signal events .",
    "another significant background comes from events with radiative return to a lower mass @xmath57 state with a subsequent @xmath58 decay .",
    "momenta of @xmath22 mesons produced in this process fall in the same region as those for @xmath22 mesons from the three - body @xmath59 decays .",
    "@xmath22 mesons originating from the two - body @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 decays produce peaks around @xmath63  gev/@xmath64 , 1.18  gev/@xmath64 and 1.28  gev/@xmath64 , respectively .",

    ", we impose a requirement on the particle identification variable , which has 86% efficiency and a 7% fake rate from misidentified pions . charged tracks that are positively identified as electrons or protons",
    "are excluded . since the muon identification efficiency and fake rate vary significantly with the track momentum , we do not veto muons to avoid additional systematic errors .",
