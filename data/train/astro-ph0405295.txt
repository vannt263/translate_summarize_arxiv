    "its strong lensing power was first noticed by  @xcite in a survey for bright gravitational lensing arcs .",
    "subsequently , several bright arcs and multiply imaged sources  @xcite were discovered .",
    "+ in this paper we analyze the first _",
    "chandra _ observation of ac  114 .",
    "this hot ( @xmath3 ) cluster shows an irregular morphology with a highly elliptical shape .",
    "the central cd galaxy , slightly displaced with respect to the centroid of the x - ray emission , is aligned in the general direction of the x - ray brightness elongation . + throughout this paper we quote errors at the @xmath4 confidence level and , unless otherwise stated , we use @xmath5 ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) .",
    "this implies a linear scale of @xmath8 per arcsec at the cluster distance @xmath9 .",
    "the galaxy cluster ac  114 was observed on 2000 november 17 by the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory , using the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) ( observation - id 1562 ) for 74.3 ksec ; the cluster emission lies mainly in the back - illuminated ccd s3 .",
    "+ the chandra interactive analysis of observation ( ciao 2.3 ) software was used throughout .",
    "level 2 event files supplied by the chandra x - ray center ( cxc ) were updated with new gain maps ; bad pixels were removed using the observation - specific bad pixel list provided by the ( cxc ) .",
    "periods of high background rate were eliminated by visual inspection of the light curve in the energy range @xmath10 ; time intervals with rates higher than @xmath11 were eliminated , leading to a final useful exposure time of @xmath12 ksec .",
    "+ throughout the spectral analysis the blank field background sets ( ) by  @xcite available in the chandra calibration database ( caldb ) were used , after projecting them onto our observation .",
    "the blank fields were taken at different locations and in different periods , so the following two corrections were made :    * to check for temporal changes in the particle background rate , we compared the count - rates in the cluster and blank fields in the @xmath13 energy band , where negligible cluster emission is expected .",
    "we found a count - rate ratio of @xmath14 , which , though remarkably close to unity , was nevertheless used to scale the blank field data .",
    "* we then looked for a possible residual background due to the soft ( @xmath15 ) galactic component of the cosmic x - ray diffuse emission which varies with position in the sky .",
    "we extracted spectra from the ac  114 field and from the blank fields inside a region where the lowest emission from the cluster was expected and no other cosmic source was observed . in this region ( at @xmath16 from the cluster center )",
    "a count - rate @xmath17 was measured in this region , very similar to the one measured in the blank fields ( @xmath18 ) , confirming that the x - ray emission in this area is mainly due to background .",
    "we found an excess flux ( @xmath19 ) in the cluster field , relative to the background field , at energies less than @xmath20 .",
    "the difference between the two spectra was appropriately scaled and then subtracted from each source spectrum throughout the spectral analysis .",
    "the _ chandra _ image of ac  114 in the @xmath21 energy band is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:03_7_ima ] . the emission arises mainly from the intra - cluster component and from a few additional point sources . while the x - ray surface brightness decreases rapidly out of the cluster center toward the north , and especially the north - east direction ( where at just a few arcseconds from the cluster center the x - ray emission decreases sharply almost to the background level ) , diffuse , elongated fainter emission stretches toward south / south - east down to the edge of the field of view .",
    "since the cluster clearly shows a strongly irregular morphology , we first looked for any energy dependence .",
    "we created adaptively smoothed , background and exposure corrected images of the area covered by acis detector s3 in three energy bands : @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 as shown in fig .  [",

    "pixel values of all detected point sources were replaced with values interpolated from the surrounding background regions ; the ciao tools and were used for this purpose .",
    "the images were then adaptively smoothed with minimum and maximum signal - to - noise thresholds set at @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "+    in the softest energy band ( @xmath22 ) the emission is dominated by two extended components : the cluster and an elongated tail - shaped feature extending southeast from the cluster .",
    "the elongated southeastern component becomes less prominent at higher energies .",
    "+ the centroid of the overall x - ray emission ( computed within a radius of @xmath27 in the @xmath28 band ) is located at @xmath29 , @xmath30 ( j2000.0 ) , but the cluster does not show a single x - ray peak ; noticeable emission is associated with the cluster cd galaxy , which is located about @xmath31 south - east ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 j2000.0 ) .",

    "the offset between the cd galaxy and the centroid of the diffuse intra - cluster medium ( icm ) emission is evidence that the latter is most probably not in a state of hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "to parameterize the peculiar morphology of ac  114 , we modeled the emission in the central @xmath27 of the cluster in the @xmath28 band .",
    "all point sources in the field were removed . using the sherpa software we fitted the cluster surface brightness to several models .",

    "the x - ray emission turns out to be best described by a simultaneous fit of two separate components .",

    "it is thus natural to conclude that the icm in these two regions are dynamically related , and that the cluster emission is more elongated in the southern direction , possibly due to some recent dynamic interaction .",
    "+ in order to characterize the excess soft emission in the southern region , we subtracted the two spectra extracted above , after having rescaled the northern component to have the same flux as the southern component at energies higher than @xmath122 .",

    "the two discontinuities in the surface brightness emission of the cluster are observed in projection on the plane of the sky . to obtain an estimate of the positions and amplitudes of the two jumps , we approximate the density distribution in the cluster with an analytical model .",

    "+ at @xmath159 we instead observe a sharp decrease of both the gas density and the temperature .",
    "this is consistent with the physical conditions expected if the gas was experiencing a shock .",
    "+ ac  114 could therefore be going through a merging process in its core , with consequences similar to what is observed in clusters such as abell 2142  @xcite .",
    "within @xmath158 we would then be observing the core of one of the two sub - clusters , moving toward the northeast , after a relatively recent merger .",

    "this is due to both the relative positions of the two components and to the smooth profile of the tail in contrast to the sharply decreasing one of the northern component .",
    "the resulting values of the total and gas masses are : @xmath217=(4.5\\pm1.1)\\cdot10^{14}\\ { \\rm h}^{-1}_{72}\\ { \\rm m}_{\\sun}\\nonumber\\\\ m_{\\rm gas}[1\\ { \\rm mpc}]=(8.4\\pm2.6)\\cdot10^{13}h^{-5/2}_{72}\\ { \\rm m}_{\\sun}\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] consistent values of the masses are obtained using a double-@xmath34 model for the northern component . henceforth with n+s we will imply n+s , @xmath218 model .",
    "+ although these mass estimates are highly model - dependent , some general qualitative trends emerge .",
    "when we assume that all the emission comes from a single structure ( global model ) , the results of the mass obtained with a single or a double @xmath34-model are similar , especially at small radii ( fig .",
    "[ fig : massa ] ) ; this reflects the fact that in the central region of the cluster a simple 1-@xmath34 model still provides an acceptable approximation to the surface brightness profile .",
    "+ if we assume instead that the system is a superposition of two distinct systems , we obtain systematically higher values of the mass , especially in the inner regions .",
    "this quite general result is a consequence of the non - linear dependence of x - ray luminosity on cluster masses .",
    "as seen for the global model , also for the northern component both single and double @xmath34-models provide a good description of the surface brightness profile leading to similar final values of the masses .",
    "+ we compute the gas mass fraction at r@xmath219 ; to ease comparison with previous work , we quote results for @xmath220 ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) .",
    "we remark that going out to @xmath221 needs a radial extrapolation of @xmath222 . for the three models described above",
    "we find : f@xmath223 , f@xmath224 , f@xmath225 .",
    "the values of @xmath221 for the three models are @xmath226 , @xmath227 and @xmath228 , respectively .",
    "considerably lower values of f@xmath229 are estimated for relaxed clusters by  @xcite .",
    "from the results of a spectroscopic survey of faint lensed galaxies in the core of ac  114 , @xcite revised the lensing model of the cluster derived by  @xcite which uses both strong and weak lensing constraints .",
    "the revised mass reconstruction made by  @xcite includes the strong constraints determined from the redshifts of two multiple - image systems : the 3-image s ( @xmath230 ) , that had been already included in the model by  @xcite , and the newly discovered 5-image e ( @xmath231 ) .",
    "@xcite found that a mass distribution composed of an elliptical cluster - scale component ( the central cluster ) plus an additional bimodal component , with the two clumps centered on two other galaxy concentrations , reproduces the observed lensed images .",
    "the locations of these two hypothetical additional clumps of matter are shown in the top panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : smoo_energy_bands ] . while we detect no excess x - ray emission above the background from clump 2 , diffuse x - ray emission",
    "can definitively be seen at clump 1 .",
    "it is particularly interesting to note that clump 1 is located at the southern edge of the elongated soft tail .",
    "+      from their detailed analysis of weak and strong lensing data for ac  114 ,  @xcite estimated the cluster mass within @xmath232 , @xmath233 and @xmath234 kpc of the cluster center .",
    "their results are listed in table  [ tab : lens_mass ] together with our values for the projected x - ray masses .",
    "+ the x - ray and lensing masses are in good agreement , for the two - component x - ray models , even at the smallest radii . in particular , ratios @xmath235 at 75 kpc are @xmath236 , @xmath237 , and @xmath238 for the -1@xmath34 , -2@xmath34 , and models , respectively .",
    "the results are remarkable in view of results from some other unrelaxed clusters in which the x - ray - determined masses are only one - third to one - half the lensing masses at radii less than 100 kpc  @xcite .",
    "+ the use of a detailed map of the surface mass density is crucial to accurate modeling of strong lensing phenomena . @xcite",
    "used the galaxy density to predict a cluster mass distribution that reproduced the observed strong - lensing images .",
    "+ since the x - ray emission supplies an independent tracer of the underlying cluster mass , we used our inferred ( x - ray - derived ) mass distribution for a new strong lensing analysis . for this purpose",
    "we used the gravlens software  @xcite .",
    "we found that the mass distribution computed from the model is sub - critical , and is therefore unable to produce any strong lensing .",
    "the model produces two lips - shaped caustics , one inside the other , oriented perpendicular to one another  @xcite as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lensing ] .",
    "sources inside the inner caustic are multiple imaged in patterns similar to the ones observed in the e - systems . a better match with the lensed images is obtained when the center of the northern component is slightly shifted toward the direction of the cd galaxy ; this provides a reasonably good reproduction of both e and s systems with a resulting average distance between the lensed images and their best - fit positions : @xmath239 for the five images in the e - system and @xmath240 for the three images in the s - system ( see fig .",

    "we have presented the first chandra observation of the galaxy cluster ac  114 , which has revealed a strongly irregular x - ray morphology .",
    "below @xmath144 the x - ray emission is dominated by two main components : the cluster , roughly centered on the optical position of ac  114 , and a diffuse `` tail '' , extending almost @xmath253 kpc , from the cluster center to the south - east .",
    "the tail has an energy distribution different from the rest of the cluster , showing significant excess of soft emission .",
    "the tail connects the cluster core with the location of clump 1 , an additional clump of matter previously inferred from lensing analysis .",
    "we also detect diffuse x - ray emission from clump 1 , confirming its existence .",
    "we conclude that clump 1 is probably associated with the cluster , and may have interacted with it .",
    "+ we propose a possible scenario in which clump 1 , located nearby a large over - density of galaxies , in its motion from the north - west through the cluster , has been ram - pressure stripped of most of its intra - group gas , now still visible as the soft southern tail . during its interaction with the cluster , clump 1 would have also distorted the intra - cluster gas , causing the asymmetrical stretch of the cluster emission toward south - east .",
    "such a picture is supported by recent adaptive mesh hydro / n - body simulations  @xcite which show soft extended features similar to our tail forming after substructure mergers .",
    "+ ac  114 also shows further signs of recent dynamical activity close to the cluster center . a sharp decrease in the cluster surface brightness toward north - east and a corresponding peak in the gas temperature are observed , suggesting the motion of a sub - structure toward this direction which compresses and heats intra - cluster gas ahead of its path .",
    "+ these two putative interactions take place along different directions in the plane of the sky .",
    "their time - scales are also different .",
    "high - temperature fronts forming in front of fast moving sub - structures are short - living phenomena , and are therefore signs of `` recent '' merging processes ; comparison with simulations by  @xcite lead to an estimated time of the merger of @xmath254 . in the tail region",
    "there is instead no sign of high velocities involved , and considering the length of the tail , the closest approach of clump 1 to the core must have been a much earlier event ( @xmath255 ago if one assumes the velocity of clump 1 to be @xmath256 ) .",
    "these two merger events were thus likely to have been independent phenomena .",
    "we note that in a hierarchical cosmological scenario , in which clusters form from accretion of matter through sets of intersecting filaments , multiple merging processes , directed along different axes , are expected .",
    "+ in spite of this evidence for complex interactions , we have obtained estimates of the x - ray masses that are in remarkably good agreement with lensing results , even at distances as small as 75 kpc from the cluster center .",
    "the simplest isothermal model for the x - ray emission is under - critical and thus can not reproduce the lensing results .",
    "two - component models , in which the components interact , or are seen in projection along the line of sight , however , provide a consistent estimate of the total mass and approximately reproduce the positions of strongly lensed background sources , though the best agreement is found if the x - ray emitting gas is displaced slightly with respect to the potential minimum .",
    "agreement between x - ray and lensing mass estimates has recently been found also in another irregular cluster ( ms1008.1 - 1224 ) by  @xcite .",
    "we therefore advocate for the robustness of the x - ray mass estimates , and conclude that the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium can yield accurate mass estimates even in clusters as dynamically active as ac  114 once the gas density distribution is properly mapped .",
