    "in multiband systems , the normal fermi liquid ( fl ) state of a partially filled band becomes unstable when the exciton  @xcite ( electron - hole pair ) binding energy , @xmath1 , is tuned to become larger than the direct excitation threshold energy @xmath2 ( see fig.[fig : boundstate ] ) .",
    "when this happens _ virtual _ excitons form spontaneously in the groundstate and destabilizes the fl state . as a cure for this instability",
    ", it was proposed many decades ago  @xcite that a new hartree - fock groundstate may be constructed by hybridizing the bands .",
    "such a state is characterized by a non - zero expectation value @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the electron creation / annihilation operators in the relevant bands . as a result",
    ", the relative phase between the bands is locked to form a uniform ( @xmath6 ) condensate of interband particle - hole pairs .    to distinguish condensates of _ interband _ particle - hole pairs from quantum liquids that arise from instabilities in the _ intraband _ particle - hole channel found in single band systems , like the pomeranchuk instability  @xcite",
    ", we refer to the former here as an  excitonic - liquid \" ( xl ) .    ) model with quadratic bands of equal masses is shown .",
    "the location of the exciton level @xmath7 is marked by the dashed line .",
    "@xmath1 is the exciton binding energy and @xmath8 is the direct interband excitation threshold from the chemical potential @xmath9 ( measured from the center of the gap ) . when @xmath10 , the cost of creating virtual exciton pairs become negligible . ]",
    "the xl is to be contrasted with the much studied _ excitonic - insulator _ state formed when the number of free conduction electrons and valence holes are finite .",
    "the latter can occur either naturally when the bands cross at the fermi level ( semimetal with bandgap @xmath11 ) or can be created artificially by optically pumping a semiconductor ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the two carrier types have their own chemical potentials which are tied together by thermodynamic considerations .",
    "the excitonic - insulator problem has been shown to be mathematically equivalent to the bcs ( bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ) model with electron - hole pairs instead of electron - electron pairs  @xcite .",
    "unlike the gapped excitonic - insulator state , the xl state has only one species of free carriers , hence away from half - filling the chemical potential lies in the band leading to a metallic state with a sharp fermi surface ( at least in the hartree - fock approximation ) .",
    "this raises the interesting question of the stability of the xl in the presence of gapless fermions at the fermi surface .",
    "the issue of the coupling of bosonic modes in the ordered phase to gapless fermions has received considerable attention recently , particularly concerning the applicability of the hertz theory  @xcite to continuous quantum phase transitions at @xmath0 .",
    "the issue is that integrating the fermions out completely has been shown to give rise to a non - local ( in time or frequency ) bosonic theory that is dominated by landau damping , which in most cases lead to an infinite number of marginal terms in the effective action  @xcite .",
    "( for a review of this and other related issues , see ref .  .",
    ") in all these studies , involving a single band , it is usually implicitly assumed , to ensure the stability of the condensate , that the opposite limit , i.e. , the static limit , of the fluctuation of the order - parameter @xmath13 is positive .",
    "we find that this assumption is generally violated in a multi - band system when the coupling of the order - parameter of the xl state to the collective intraband particle - hole excitations is considered .",
    "we note that the issues originating from the dynamics of the gapless fermions leading to the landau damping of the bosonic mode is irrelevant for us in establishing the stability of the condensed phase .",
    "there is considerable interest to understand if a _ uniform _ xl can in principle exist .",
    "in fact , excitonic singularities in multiband systems is recognized to be one of the very few known mechanisms capable of introducing singularities in the irreducible interactions leading to the breakdown of fl theory  @xcite . at the mean - field level , the hamiltonian couples linearly to the bilinear operators @xmath14 via a vertex function @xmath15 .",
    "the symmetries of @xmath15 are dictated by the lattice symmetries . as a result",
    ", a non - zero expectation value @xmath16 partially breaks the point group symmetry .",
    "furthermore , depending on the transformation properties of @xmath15 under the corresponding magnetic group , time - reversal ( @xmath17 ) symmetry may or may not be spontaneously broken in the groundstate .",
    "special interest in understanding the properties of electronic systems with broken @xmath17 symmetry stem from its proposed relevance to high temperature superconductivity .",
    "an intriguing proposal , put forward originally by varma as a candidate for a marginal fermi liquid , posited a non - magentic , translationally invariant groundstate with spontaneously broken @xmath17 invariance@xcite .",
    "more generally , such groundstates are novel in that they can exhibit anomalous hall and kerr effects without magnetic fields .",
    "various non - magnetic , translationally invariant states with broken @xmath17 symmetry that are ubiquitous in hartree - fock approximation schemes have been classified and analyzed in ref .. they were first demonstrated by haldane in a simple two - dimensional model of non - interacting electrons on the honeycomb lattice with a periodic magnetic field arranged in such a way that the field averages to zero in each unit cell thus preserving the translational symmetry of the lattice@xcite .",
    "it was later shown that interacting electrons on the honeycomb lattice with next - nearest neighbor interactions can form exactly the same state as proposed by haldane that spontaneously breaks @xmath17 invariance in the groundstate  @xcite .",
    "our main purpose in this paper is to analyze the stability of the mean - field solutions of particle - hole condensates both with and without @xmath17 symmetry breaking .",
    "we first show that the xl s are metallic _ away _ from half - filling . indeed ,",
    "since the single - particle states in any mean - field approximation of a particle number conserving condensate remains in one - to - one correspondence with the fl states with well - defined quasiparticle excitations , at the hartree - fock level the condensates away from half - filling are always metallic with a continuum of gapless fermionic excitations at the fermi surface .",
    "we show that the hybridization of the bands necessarily induces a coupling of the xl order - parameter to the gapless fermions at the fermi surface . in the following ,",
    "we analyze the static susceptibility originating from this coupling in two different two - band models , both of which stabilizes an xl phase at the mean - field level .",

    "only the dominant scattering channel , the direct intraband scattering of the electrons and holes , are retained .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath29 has been used extensively as a minimal model to analyze the excitonic properties of optically pumped degenerate semiconductors  @xcite .",
    "we note that because optical pumping fixes the number of electrons and holes @xmath30 , the chemical potential , @xmath31 , in these systems appear as  @xcite @xmath32\\psi_\\mathbf{k}+h_\\textrm{int}$ ] . a particle - hole transformation",
    ", @xmath33 and @xmath34 , maps @xmath35 to the continuum fermion model with attractive interactions  @xcite whose mean - field solution corresponds exactly to the bcs hamiltonian .",

    "since @xmath12 when the xl state is formed , the particle - hole transformation does not provide much further insights .",
    "however , we show that the instability is closely related to the cooper - like pairing of interband particle - hole pairs at the fermi surface .",
