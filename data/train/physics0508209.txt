    "recent theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite studies have shown the possibility of creating novel types of microstructured materials that demonstrate the property of negative refraction . in particular , the composite materials created by arrays of wires and split - ring resonators were shown to possess both negative real parts of magnetic permeability and dielectric permittivity for microwaves .",
    "these materials are often referred to as _ left - handed metamaterials _ , _",
    "double - negative materials _ , _ negative - index materials _ , or _ materials with negative refraction_. properties of such materials were first analyzed theoretically by v. veselago a long time ago @xcite , but they were demonstrated experimentally only recently . as was shown by veselago @xcite ,",
    "left - handed metamaterials possess a number of peculiar properties , including negative refraction for interface scattering , inverse light pressure , reverse doppler effect , etc .    many suggested and demonstrated applications of negative - index metamaterials utilize unusual features of wave propagation and scattering at the interfaces .",
    "in particular , the effect of negative refraction can be used to realize focusing with a flat slab , the so - called planar lens  @xcite ; in a sharp contrast with the well - known properties of conventional lenses with a positive refractive index where curved surfaces are needed to form an image . moreover",
    ", the resolution of the negative - index flat lens can be better than a wavelength due to the effect of amplification of evanescent modes  @xcite .",
    "direct numerical simulations provide the unique means for a design of microwave and optical devices based on the negative - index materials , however any realistic simulation should take into account metamaterial dispersion and losses  @xcite as well as a nonlinear response  @xcite .",
    "such numerical simulations are often carried out within the framework of the effective medium approximation , when the metamaterial is characterized by the effective dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability .",
    "this simplification allows for modelling of large - scale wave dynamics using the well - known finite - difference time - domain ( fdtd ) numerical methods  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss the main features and major difficulties in applying the standard fdtd numerical schemes for simulating wave scattering by wedges and interfaces of finite - extend negative - index metamaterials , including a key issue of positioning of a discretization grid in the numerical yee scheme  @xcite necessary to obtain consistent convergence in modeling surface waves at an interface between conventional dielectric and metamaterial with negative dielectric permittivity and negative magnetic permeability .",
    "in particular , we demonstrate that , in the framework of the continuous - medium approximation , wave scattering on the wedge may result in a resonant excitation of surface waves with infinitely large spatial frequencies , leading to non - convergence of the simulation results that depend on the discretization step .",

    "the response of negative - index materials is known to be strongly frequency dependent  @xcite , however in the linear regime the wave propagation at different wavelengths can be described independently .",

    "[ sect : interface ]    the concept of perfect sub - wavelength imaging of a point source through reconstitution of the evanescent waves by a flat lens has remained highly controversial  @xcite because it is severely constrained by anisotropy and losses of the metamaterials .",
