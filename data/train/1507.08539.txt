    "recently , the field of complex networks has shifted from the analysis of isolated network ( capturing and modeling one aspect of the examined system ) toward the analysis of the family of complex networks simultaneously modeling different phenomena ( aspects ) of the examined system , or modeling interactions and relationships among different subsystems .",

    "the complexity of any natural language is contained in the interplay among several language levels .",
    "below the word - level , it is possible to explore the type of phonology , morphology and syllabic subsystem complexity .",
    "for example , the phonology subsystem complexity is reflected in the morphology subsystem complexity . on the word - level , the morphology subsystem complexity reflects in the complexity of the word order , syntactic rules and the ambiguity of lexis . since the word order can be considered as the primary factor ( but not the only one ) that determines linguistic structure , it is important to explore the subsystems interactions by which it is influenced .    in this research",

    "this adequately explains the driving principle of the co - sin relationships which we have confirmed in this research .",
    "still , an explanation of the linguistic grounding for the sin - syl relationships remains an open challenge .",
    "our results strongly suggest that there are some properties which are inherent in the word - level layers and not for the subword layers ; while some are inherent in the word - subword relations .",
    "more precisely , it seems that syntax and syllables exhibit influences of the same linguistic phenomena .      in this research",
    "we use the multilayer networks framework to explore various language subsystems interactions .",
    "multilayer networks are constructed from five variations of the same original text : three on the word - level ( syntax , co - occurrence and it s shuffled counterpart ) and two on the subword level ( syllables and graphemes ) .",
    "the analysis and comparison of layers at word and subword levels is employed in order to determine the mechanism of mutual interactions between different linguistic units .",
    "the presented findings corroborate that the multilayer framework can meet the demands in expressing the complex structure of language . according to these results",
    "one can notice substantial differences between the networks structures of different language layers , which are hidden during the exploration of an isolated layer , regardless of modeled language ( e.g. croatian or english ) .",
    "therefore , it is important to include all language layers simultaneously in order to capture all language characteristics in the systematic exploration .",
    "the multilayer network framework is a powerful , consistent and systematic approach to model several linguistic subsystems simultaneously and to provide a more general view on language .",
    "the word - level layers can be represented as multiplex networks ( the coupled links have 1:1 or 0:1 inter - connections ) , while the connections between word and subword layers are not coupled ( have n : m inter - connections ) .",
    "hence , defining the unified theoretical model for the multilayer language networks is essential for further endeavors in the research of linguistic networks .",
    "these findings reveal a variety of new and thrilling questions which will open new paths for future research in network linguistics . to conclude",
    ", we are at the very beginning of an exciting and challenging pursuit .",
    "hence , our future research plans involve : exploring the relationships of other languages subsystems ( i.e. morphological , phonetic ) , defining the theoretical model capable of capturing all structural variations of language subsystems relationships and eventually explain the governing principle of mutual interactions and conceptual universalities in natural languages .",
