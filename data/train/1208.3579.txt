    "apart from van der waals ( vdw ) interactions , no universal , and certainly no electrostatic interactions are commonly assumed to exist between uncharged ( neutral ) objects  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , _ some interactions _ are every so often observed between neutral surfaces in the presence of bathing ionic ( salt ) solutions  @xcite and wernersson & kjellander studied theoretically the case of a salt solution with mono- and/or divalent ions confined in a slit between neutral dielectrics by employing the anisotropic hypernetted chain method  @xcite .",
    "electrostatic interactions , mediated by mobile monovalent ionic solutions , are known to be described very well in terms of mean - field theories such as the poisson - boltzmann ( pb ) equation  @xcite .",
    "for the particular case of symmetric uncharged plane - parallel dielectric bodies , which will be considered in this paper , the standard pb treatment can not account for inter - surface forces as it yields only a trivial uniform ion distribution in the slit between the inner surfaces of the slabs , and thus a nil result for the inter - surface force .",
    "however , in the absence of surface charges , other electrostatic effects involving mobile ions , not included in the pb approach , increase in importance , especially when multivalent ions are present in the slit .",
    "these include fluctuation / correlation and , in particular , dielectric image effects , which are missing within the standard pb description in planar geometry  @xcite . in fact , correlation effects are expected to be significant at uncharged interfaces , since for each individual multivalent ion , the screening cloud and its dielectric images are pinned to the mobile ion itself rather than any fixed external surface charges .",
    "such  ion - image \" correlations constitute the core insight of our subsequent analysis for neutral surfaces , suggesting that a proper theoretical understanding of interactions between neutral surfaces may thus follow from the fact that ions and their dielectric images are _ strongly correlated_.    such correlation effects are expected to be important , especially in the presence of highly asymmetric salt mixtures containing a ( usually ) low concentration of an ionic species with a high valency .",
    "this latter situation is in fact quite relevant experimentally  @xcite .",
    "we thus focus on such asymmetric salt mixtures confined between two uncharged plane - parallel dielectric half - spaces , and extend the existing analysis  @xcite to the case where the asymmetric ionic mixture contains at least one multivalent ion component of high valency .",
    "the case of symmetric ionic fluids and/or weakly charged ionic mixtures at neutral interfaces , differing from the focus of the present work , has been approached on various levels of approximations @xcite starting from the seminal theoretical work of onsager and samaras @xcite .",
    "we base our approach on a combination of methods , i.e. , explicit - ion , implicit - ion and yukawa monte - carlo ( mc ) simulations as well as an effective  dressed multivalent ion \" theory , which accounts for the salt screening effects as well as the dielectric polarizability of the neutral dielectrics .",
    "we show that this latter approach provides a simple and useful analytical framework for the present and previous  @xcite results .",
    "it is similar to a  dressed counterion \" model discussed in the context of charged surfaces in contact with a bathing salt solution containing multivalent  counterions \"  @xcite .",
    "there it was shown that for high - valency counterions , the degrees of freedom associated with the monovalent ions can be integrated out and an effective single - particle theory can be obtained based on a virial expansion in terms of the counterions fugacity , which agrees very well with mc simulations within its regime of applicability .",
    "this analysis is therefore also akin to the limiting single - particle description , known as the strong coupling ( sc ) theory , which was introduced originally for counterion - only systems  @xcite .",
    "the sc theory incorporates , to the leading order , strong electrostatic correlations , which develop between counterions and the surface charges in the limit of large counterion valency . for uncharged surfaces , such surface charge - counterion correlations are absent but , nevertheless , the presence of multivalent ions can make the collective mean - field description obsolete , provided that the surface dielectric (  image charge \" ) effects",
    "are properly accounted for . as we will show , the single - particle sc framework can be reformulated and generalized in order to capture the ion - image correlation effects and thereby , the interaction mediated by an asymmetric salt mixture between two uncharged dielectric bodies , even on a quantitative level .",
    "these interactions are shown to be quite short - range ( up to separation distances of just a few nano - meters ) and are of electrostatic nature even for neutral bodies .",
    "they combine depletion as well as dielectric image effects in a novel kind of interaction that can play a significant role in shaping the behavior of neutral soft matter systems  most prominently at the nano scale .",
    "these interactions should be therefore considered in parallel with the hydrophobic interactions  @xcite as well as vdw interactions  @xcite deemed to play an important role in the interaction of neutral surfaces .",
    "we base our analysis on explicit - ion mc simulations of non - specific ion interactions and while we take dielectric image interactions properly into account , we disregard the vdw ( dispersion ) interactions of the ions with the dielectric interfaces , an approximation that is justified for high - valency ions  @xcite .",
    "the purpose and emphasis of our endeavor is thus twofold : to show that , for highly asymmetric ionic mixtures , a coarse - grained mc approach with _ implicit _ monovalent ions can be properly applied to describe interactions between neutral surfaces , and secondly to provide a simple analytical theory , which could explain the main features of these simulations on a qualitative level that becomes quantitative at sufficiently high monovalent salt concentration .    .",
    "the slit region is in equilibrium with a bulk reservoir containing a monovalent 1:1 salt as well as an asymmetric multivalent @xmath0:1 salt .",
    "explicit - ion , implicit - ion and yukawa levels of description are indicated schematically ( top to bottom)see the text for details . ]",
    "let us consider two neutral plane - parallel dielectric half - spaces of dielectric constant @xmath1 at a separation distance of @xmath2 , as shown schematically in fig  [ fig : geom00 ] .",
    "the intervening slit is assumed to be filled with an aqueous solution of dielectric constant @xmath3 , containing an ionic mixture comprised of a 1:1 monovalent salt solution of bulk concentration @xmath4 and an asymmetric @xmath0:1 multivalent salt solution of bulk concentration @xmath5 , where @xmath0 stands for the charge valency of multivalent ions .",

    "in order to investigate the inter - surface forces induced between neutral dielectrics within the model described above , we shall employ mc simulations on two different levels of description as well as an analytical theory .",
    "specifically , we use _ explicit - ion simulations _ ( referred to as  explicit \" simulations ) where all ions in the ionic mixture , including those of the 1:1 and @xmath0:1 salt , are simulated explicitly ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : geom00 ] , top ) . in this case ,",
    "the closest - approach distances between the ions are taken as @xmath7  nm between monovalent cations and anions , and @xmath8  nm between multivalent ions and monovalent ions .",
    "these values are small enough so that the excluded - volume effects are negligible , yet large enough to prevent bjerrum pairing of ions in the solution .",
    "the dielectric polarization of the half - spaces with planar boundaries is accounted for by using repeated image reflections .",
    "the image reflection sum has to be truncated for computational reasons , and we found satisfactory accuracy with only three explicit reflections across each surface .",
    "all mc simulations were performed using a multi - component grand - canonical ensemble , ensuring equilibrium with a bulk solution of the prescribed composition .    in the second approach ,",
    "we use _ implicit - ion simulations _ ( referred to as  implicit \" simulations ) in which only multivalent ions ( @xmath9 ) are explicitly simulated , whereas the effects of monovalent ions are included implicitly via a debye - hckel - like ionic cloud . in the implicit model , apart from the dielectric polarization of the half - spaces , we account for the fact that the screening ionic cloud around multivalent ions is not spherically symmetric but distorted near the ( hard ) boundaries ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : geom00 ] , middle ) .",
    "this is accomplished by using the modified non - homogeneous debye - hckel ( dh ) interaction kernel ( green s function ) @xmath10 in order to compute the electrostatic interaction energy between each two ( explicit ) multivalent ions of electric charge @xmath11 located at positions @xmath12 and @xmath13 in the slit , i.e. , @xmath14 . in the fourier - bessel representation ,",

    "note that when multivalent @xmath0:1 salt is introduced in the system , additional monovalent ions with concentration @xmath27 are simultaneously released into the bulk and thus they also contribute to the screening parameter  @xcite .",
    "the back - transform of the interaction kernel to real space follows from @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the zeroth - order bessel function of the first kind . in the limit of high dielectric mismatch , @xmath30 ,",
    "the interaction kernel can be simplified significantly , yielding an analytical form in real space as @xmath31 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the unit vector in the @xmath33 direction and the integer index @xmath34 runs through both positive and negative values .",
    "the term with @xmath35 stands for the direct dh potential , @xmath36 , of a test charge without any dielectric effects .",
    "the above expression thus reflects a simple picture within which the total potential between two parallel dielectric half - spaces can be represented as a sum of an infinite number of screened coulomb image charges .",
    "this form of image summation significantly reduces also the computational costs , since summing up to , e.g. , @xmath37 , already gives a very well - converged result for the cases we consider in this work .",
    "we have thus used the above summation series in the implicit mc simulations , and focus on the dielectric jump value @xmath38 , corresponding to the water - hydrocarbon interface ( assuming @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) .",
    "the overall hamiltonian in the implicit mc approach then reads , @xmath41 combining the screened interaction with distorted dh cloud between all multivalent ion pairs and their images ( first term ) as well as their self - image interaction energy ( second term ) .",
    "the implicit mc simulations were performed in the grand - canonical ensemble .",
    "the simulated lateral system size was chosen such that the slit contained between around 50 to 200 multivalent ions .    in a third simulation approach ( referred to as  yukawa \" simulations ) , we use the same implicit model as above but neglect the distortion of the ionic clouds near the half - spaces as well as their polarizability ( see fig .  [",

    "in fig .  [ fig : dens ] , we show the density profiles of multivalent ions with valency @xmath43 within the slit , as obtained from our mc simulations for the case of a 4:1 and 1:1 salt mixture . in all cases the multivalent salt is assumed to have a bulk concentration of @xmath44  mm . in fig .",
    "[ fig : dens]a , we have an additional 1:1 salt of bulk concentration @xmath45  mm as well as a dielectric jump parameter of @xmath38 .",
    "as seen , both explicit and implicit mc simulations show a pronounced depletion of multivalent ions from the proximity of the two neutral walls , where the density tends to zero .",
    "the explicit and implicit data nearly agree , particularly near the walls , with somewhat larger deviations in the middle of the slit .",
    "a similar surface depletion effect can be seen when the additional monovalent salt is increased but the agreement becomes progressively better ; in fig .",
    "[ fig : dens]b , we show the results for @xmath46  mm , which exhibits a very good agreement between the explicit and implicit mc simulations .",
    "this confirms the idea that the degrees of freedom associated with monovalent ions enter only in an effective debye - hckel way as formulated in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : u])-([eq : gamma ] ) . therefore the depletion of multivalent ions can indeed be ascribed both to dielectric images due to dielectric polarization of the half - spaces as well as to the fact that the exclusion of salt ions from the impenetrable surfaces leads to a non - trivial distortion of ionic clouds in the vicinity of the half - spaces ( fig .",
    "[ fig : geom00 ] , middle ) , effectively engendering  salt - induced image charges \" which repel the ions from the walls .",
    "alternatively , one could say that ions in the vicinity of the interfaces have fewer neighbors and thus all the ions , i.e. , both monovalent ( not shown ) @xcite and multivalent ions , are depleted from the proximity of the surfaces .",
    "salt - image effects \" are present even if there is no dielectric discontinuity at the boundaries ( @xmath47 ) as seen in fig .",

    "[ fig : dens]a and b ) .",
    "other remarkable differences with the latter case are that multivalent ions can have a finite contact density at the boundaries when @xmath47 and also exhibit an even better agreement between explicit and implicit mc data ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dens]c ) .",
    "the above results clearly go beyond the standard pb description which is expected to give only a trivial uniform ion distribution between neutral surfaces in the planar geometry . in order to gain any insight into the behavior of this system one needs to conceptualize outside of the pb box .",
    "we thus proceed by proposing a simple analytical theory , akin to the concept of  dressed counterions \" , which was developed previously in the context of a multivalent salt solution confined between two charged surfaces without a dielectric jump  @xcite or next to one charged dielectric interface  @xcite , where it was exhaustively and successfully tested against mc simulations . in the present context with neutral surfaces , where one can not speak of ",
    "counter ions \" proper , we refer to this approximation as the  dressed multivalent ion \" approach .",
    "it follows from the same principles as our implicit mc simulations , i.e. , by integrating out the degrees of freedom associated with all monovalent ions treated on a linear dh level , and hence by obtaining an effective theory where multivalent ions are still described explicitly but the role of monovalent ions enters only implicitly  @xcite .",
    "this effective theory can be justified only for highly asymmetric ionic mixtures with large @xmath0 , as is of primary interest here , and can be obtained systematically from a field - theoretical formalism , which we shall not discuss further in this paper ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "note that the system of dressed multivalent ions still presents a full many - body problem and as such can be treated exactly only via simulations ( which , in the present context , would correspond precisely to our implicit mc simulations that incorporate the proper implicit interaction kernels ) .",
    "an approximate analytical theory then follows from a virial expansion , which for neutral systems is expected to work at sufficiently small concentration of multivalent ions , as is often the case in experimental systems  @xcite . for charged surfaces",
    ", such a virial expansion can be shown to be related to a strong - coupling expansion of multivalent counterions  @xcite , where electrostatic correlations between counterions and the opposite surface charges become dominant on the leading order . in the present case",
    ", such a strong - coupling theory for multivalent ions can not be developed as the surfaces are neutral and the electrostatic coupling parameter _ '",
    "a la netz _ is non - existent .",
    "nevertheless , the virial expansion can capture the salient features of the problem as it incorporates the ion - image correlation , which in this context becomes the dominant mechanism at work for multivalent ions at low concentrations .    on the leading order one",
    "thus finds that the only driving force for redistribution of multivalent ions in the slit @xmath49 is their self - energy , leading to the density profile @xmath50 where the self - energy ( per unit @xmath51 ) reads @xmath52 the above analytical result is shown in fig .",

    "we now turn our attention to the interaction ( disjoining ) pressure acting on each of the neutral surfaces due to the presence of the salt mixture in the slit .",
    "this pressure is composed of two separate additive contributions : one stemming from the monovalent ions as constituents of the 1:1 salt as well as of the @xmath0:1 salt , and the other originating from multivalent ions .",
    "the latter one can be calculated analytically from the single - particle grand canonical potential within the  dressed multivalent ion \" approximation .",
    "the former is trickier and can only be evaluated approximately by starting from an exact pressure equation for a simple salt system and then by remorphing it in a self - consistent way , using the same line of thought as in the case of multivalent ions .",

    "it should be noted that monovalent ions do also exhibit depletion ( even though much weaker than the multivalent ions ) from the vicinity of the walls , and thus a non - uniform density profile in the slit .",
    "this effect is implicitly embedded in the modified dh interaction kernel as noted above ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and has been verified within our explicit mc simulations @xcite .",
    "we find that the _ total _ density profile of monovalent ions can be described very well by their corresponding self - energy as @xmath58 which is to be used in expression ( [ eq : contact2 ] ) for the depletion pressure due to monovalent ions .    in order to evaluate the slit pressure due to multivalent ions analytically",
    ", we now use the virial scheme , which to the leading order is given by a single - particle grand canonical potential @xmath59 and can be calculated explicitly  @xcite .",
    "the slit pressure can be deduced by differentiation with respect to the volume of the slit , @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the fugacity of the multivalent ions .",
    "we thus find @xmath62 this contribution should be added to the one from the monovalent ions in order to obtain the total slit pressure .",
    "the _ interaction _ ( disjoining ) pressure acting on the bounding surfaces follows by subtracting the bulk pressure , @xmath63 , as @xmath64 where @xmath65 .    in order to proceed with the simulation results",
    ", we first consider the case with no dielectric mismatch across the bounding surface , i.e. , @xmath47 . in fig .",

    "as seen , the explicit and implicit simulations predict an attractive force at small separations which we shall elaborate on further below .",
    "it is interesting to note however that the naive yukawa treatment of the multivalent salt without incorporating the image kernel , eq .",
    "( [ eq : uim ] ) , leads to qualitatively incorrect results as it gives a repulsive interaction pressure .",
    "the repulsion in this latter case appears to be purely osmotic in nature as surfaces are uncharged . in the case of implicit or explicit simulations , the interactions due to dielectric and",
    " salt - induced \" image charges lead to depletion of ions from the slit which in turn engenders a depletion attraction between the surfaces .",
    "this depletion is thus generated by a confined ionic cloud in contrast to standard depletion interactions , which are steric in nature  @xcite .",
    "both types of depletion effects are rather similar except that the image - depletion interaction leads to softer dependence of the interaction pressure on separation when compared to the standard hard - sphere depletion .    in the case",
    "where there is a finite dielectric mismatch , e.g. , @xmath66 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pressure]a , the depletion attraction appears to be more pronounced as more ions are depleted from the slit region due both to  salt - induced \" image as well as dielectric image repulsions .",

    "all salt ions are expelled from the slit and the attractive pressure corresponds to the bulk osmotic pressure .",
    "in general one can discern that the implicit simulations follow nicely the explicit simulations , except at very small inter - surface separations , where more explicit details on the screening cloud is needed .    the analytical prediction for the total pressure , eq .",

    "the many - body effects due to interactions between different ( dressed ) multivalent ions is negligible and the main contribution results from the self - image interactions as included in the analytical theory above .",
    "the analytical curves show larger disagreement with explicit mc data , especially at small separations , but these deviations amount to less than about 20% @xcite .",

    "@xcite leads us to surmise that a larger valency leads also to a stronger repulsive interaction between dressed multivalent ions that in turn pushes them out of the bulk and back into the slit , where they act osmotically , thus increasing the repulsive component of the interaction pressure .",
    "note that this  soft sphere packing \" mechanism is supported by the osmotic pressure measurements on free standing films as well as surface force measurements  @xcite , where an oscillatory behavior is observed between neutral ( or charged ) flat surfaces in the presence of solutions containing highly charged species ( colloidal particles or polyelectrolytes ) .",
    "in the final part of this study , we compare the image depletion interactions discussed above with typical values of the vdw contribution that also acts between uncharged surfaces in an additive manner , i.e. , all the interactions calculated and analyzed in this work are _ on top of the vdw interactions _ acting across the slit between two dielectric interfaces .",

    "<S> we study the interaction between two neutral plane - parallel dielectric bodies in the presence of a highly asymmetric ionic fluid , containing multivalent as well as monovalent ( salt ) ions . </S>",
    "<S> image charge interactions , due to dielectric discontinuities at the boundaries , as well as effects from ion confinement in the slit region between the surfaces are taken fully into account , leading to image - generated depletion attraction , ion correlation attraction and steric - like repulsive interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate these effects by employing a combination of methods including explicit - ion and implicit - ion monte - carlo simulations , as well as an effective interaction potential analytical theory . </S>",
    "<S> the latter incorporates strong ion - image charge correlations , which develop in the presence of high valency ions in the mixture . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the implicit - ion simulations and the proposed analytical theory can describe the explicit simulation results on a qualitative level , while excellent quantitative agreement can be obtained for sufficiently large monovalent salt concentrations . the resultant attractive interaction between the neutral surfaces is shown to be significant , as compared with the usual van der waals interactions between semi - infinite dielectrics , and can thus play a significant role at the nano scale . </S>"
