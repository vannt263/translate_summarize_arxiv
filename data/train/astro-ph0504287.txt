    "galaxies are known to possess well  defined correlations between their various structural and kinematic parameters ( e.g. , faber & jackson 1976 ; tully & fisher 1977 ; djorgovski & davis 1987 ; dressler et al.1987 ; caon , capaccioli , & donofrio 1993 ; graham , trujillo , & caon 2001 ; de rijcke et al .  2005 ; matkovi & guzmn 2005 ) .",
    "these empirical `` scaling  laws '' provide key observational constraints needed to test current theoretical models of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "obviously even the most basic of these , the luminosity  size relation ( e.g. , dutton et al .",
    "2005 ; mcintosh et al .",
    "2005 ) , relies on our ability to accurately measure robust photometric parameters .    in this vein , the need for a more unified approach to galaxy photometry has recently been highlighted by cross et al .",
    "they noted that much of the discrepancy in galaxy magnitudes ( and sizes ) between various groups is because of the varying methodology applied .",
    "for example , some authors use kron magnitudes , others petrosian magnitudes , some extrapolate fitted models to large radii , while others use somewhat limited aperture photometry .",
    "this can impact significantly on global measures of the galaxy population , such as the luminosity function ( e.g. , norberg et al .",
    "2002 ; blanton et al .",
    "2003a ; driver et al .  2005 ) , the color ",
    "magnitude relation ( e.g. , scodeggio 2001 ; chang 2005 , and references therein ) , and the luminosity density ( e.g. , yasuda et al .  2001 ; cross et al .",
    "it also , for example , impacts on studies of the supermassive black hole mass function derived using the galaxy luminosity  black hole mass relation ( e.g. , mclure & dunlop 2004 , shankar et al .",
    "2004 , and references therein ) .",
    "perhaps less obvious however , are the consequences for the calculation of size and surface brightness distributions ( e.g. , kormendy 1977 ; cross et al .  2001 ;",
    "shen et al.2003 ; driver et al .",
    "these are typically derived from the half ",
    "light radius which in turn depends critically on an accurate assessment of the total flux .",
    "if the magnitude is underestimated , the size and surface brightness distributions will be affected .",
    "one of the great strengths of the petrosian ( 1976 ) index , the average intensity within some projected radius divided by the intensity at that radius , and similarly the radii themselves corresponding to some fixed petrosian index , is that they do not depend on a galaxy s distance .",
    "that is , because surface brightness dimming does not change the shape of a galaxy s light ",
    "profile , it does not affect the petrosian index , nor does it affect the observed galaxy concentration .",
    "furthermore , due to the petrosian index s ability to define aperture sizes which contain the bulk of an object s light , and due to the large influx of small , faint images of high  redshift galaxies that are now available , the petrosian index has experienced a resurgence ( e.g. , wirth , koo , & kron 1994 ; bershady , lowenthal , & koo 1998 ; dalcanton 1998 ; takamiya 1999 ; bershady et al .",

    "strauss et al .  ( 2002 ; their section 3.2 ) do however stress the fact that a different fraction of galaxy light is missed depending on whether a galaxy has an @xmath2 light  profile or an exponential light  profile , and they emphasize the subsequent need to account for this in analyses of the sloan digital sky survey ( _ sdss _ ; york et al .  2000 )",
    "galaxy data .    in an effort to account for the flux missed by petrosian apertures , this paper outlines a corrective procedure to convert petrosian magnitudes into total ( srsic ) galaxy magnitudes , as provided by popular codes such as gim2d ( simard 2002 ) , galfit ( peng et al.2002 ) , and budda ( de souza , gadotti , & dos anjos 2004 ) .",
    "the key to doing this lies in the ` shape ' of a galaxy s stellar distribution , that is , its concentration .",
    "this quantity may be obtained with or without the use of a fitted light  profile model .    in the absence of measurement errors ,",
    "all @xmath2 light ",
    "profiles have exactly the same concentration index @xmath4  the ratio of radii containing 90% and 50% of the petrosian flux",
    "( e.g. , blanton et al .  2001 ; strauss et al .  2002 ; goto et al .",
    "the same is true for an exponential @xmath7 light ",
    "profile , although the specific value of the concentration will be different in this case .",
    "it follows that the observed range of galaxy concentrations , if not due to errors , reflects a range of light ",
    "profile shapes ; that is , galaxies do not simply have exponential or @xmath2 light  profiles .    recognizing this in the _ sdss _ data , blanton et al .",

    "profile shapes and provide estimates of their total luminosities , sizes , and surface brightnesses .",
    "indeed , in the case of ( dwarf and ordinary ) elliptical galaxies , such an approach is crucial if one is to properly understand the various relationships between such terms ( e.g. , graham & guzmn 2003 , their section 4 ) .",
    "however , for low signal  to  noise data or where the spatial resolution is lacking , it can become difficult to obtain reliable srsic fits .",
    "one therefore needs an alternative strategy to obtain the total galaxy flux and associated half  light terms .    using only the observed concentration , @xmath4 , within the petrosian aperture",
    ", we provide an easy prescription to recover the total ( srsic ) flux from the petrosian flux while maintaining the distance  independent qualities of the petrosian system .",
    "we also explain how one can recover the effective radii and associated surface brightness terms .",
    "the corrective formula presented here are not only valid for pure @xmath2 or exponential profiles , but applicable to galaxies having intermediary light ",
    "profile shapes and a range of more extreme stellar distributions .",
    "the petrosian ( 1976 ) index was initially introduced with the goal of measuring galaxy evolution .",
    "it gained additional popularity from its potential to determine the cosmological parameters ( e.g. , djorgovski & spinrad 1981 ; sandage & perelmuter 1990 ) .",
    "indeed , under the assumption of structural homology , it provided a means to obtain `` standard rods '' that could be used to constrain cosmogonic models .",
    "nowadays it is often used as a tool for defining aperture sizes from which to measure galaxy magnitudes .",
    "the petrosian index , @xmath8 , is a function of a galaxy s projected radius @xmath9 , and can be written as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is an object s ( projected ) intensity at some radius @xmath9 , and @xmath12 is the average intensity within that radius . following , for example , blanton et al .",
    "( 2003b ) , who modeled 183,487 _ sdss _ galaxies , we adopt srsic s ( 1963 ) @xmath6 model to represent the possible range of light  profiles @xmath11 .",

    "profile at the effective radius @xmath15 , and @xmath16 defines the ` shape ' of the profile .",
    "the term @xmath17 is simply a function of @xmath16 and chosen is such that @xmath18 , with @xmath19 and @xmath20 the incomplete and complete gamma functions respectively ( ciotti 1991 ) . ] to ensure the radius @xmath15 encloses half of the profile s total luminosity .",
    "using the substitution @xmath21 , and thus @xmath22 and @xmath23 , the petrosian index reduces to @xmath24 where @xmath25(2n , x ) is the incomplete gamma function defined as @xmath26    the inverted petrosian index , @xmath27 , is more commonly used in the literature ( e.g. , bershady , jangren , & conselice 2000 ; blanton et al .",
    "2001 ) and is shown in figure  [ figpet2 ] .",
    "it has a value of 1 at @xmath28 and falls to zero at large radii .",
    "although the petrosian index can be used to determine a galaxy s ` petrosian radius ' @xmath29  the radius where the index equals some fixed value  it is important to determine the relation between this radius and the effective radius @xmath15 : as shown inset to fig . 1",
    ", @xmath30 varies with srsic index @xmath16 for a fixed @xmath31 .",
    "constant multiples of @xmath29 have been used as a means to define an appropriate aperture size for purposes of deriving galaxy magnitudes .",
    "for example , some authors have chosen to use 2@xmath29 with @xmath32 ( e.g. , bershady et al .",
    "2000 ; blanton et al .  2001 ) and others 3@xmath29 with @xmath33 ( e.g. , conselice et al .  2002 , 2003 ) .",

    "consortium adopted the former criteria . from figure  [ figpet2 ]",

    "( the absolute value of @xmath15 , and @xmath14 , are not important , only the ratio @xmath34 and the value of @xmath16 determine @xmath31 , see equation  [ eqeta ] . )    this is shown more clearly in the inset figure where one can see , as a function of profile shape @xmath16 , the number of effective radii that @xmath35 and 0.5 correspond to . if @xmath16=4 , then @xmath32 occurs at @xmath36 .",
    "however , when using @xmath33 , if @xmath16=4 then @xmath29 equals only @xmath37 roughly corresponds to @xmath38 , this is only true for srsic profiles with @xmath39 ( see figure  [ figpet2 ] ) .",
    "exact values for @xmath29 , in terms of @xmath15 , when @xmath33 are given in bershady et al .",
    "( 1998 ) for n = 0.5 , 1 , and 4 . ] .",
    "although this particular radius is multiplied by a factor of three before determining the petrosian magnitude , this still amounts to an aperture of size less than 0.5@xmath15 .",
    "this particular petrosian magnitude therefore greatly underestimates an object s total magnitude .    for a srsic profile , the petrosian magnitude , @xmath40 ,",
    "is given by the expression @xmath41 , \\label{eqmag}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 , @xmath43 is the multiplicative factor ( usually 2 or 3 ) , and @xmath44 .",
    "the total magnitude is obtained by replacing @xmath45 with the ( complete ) gamma function @xmath46 . the extent to which the petrosian magnitude underestimates the total magnitude is shown in figure  [ figpet4 ] under two conditions .",
    "the first is when the srsic profiles extend to infinity ( panel a ) .",
    "although galaxies are recognized not to have sharp edges , the second condition assumes that the srsic profiles truncate at 5@xmath15 ( panel b ) .",
    "there is no physical justification for a truncation at 5@xmath15 ; this is simply chosen in order to explore the magnitude deficit if the light  profiles do nt extend to infinity . while elliptical galaxy light ",
    "profiles continue into the background sky ",
    "noise ( e.g. , caon et al .  1993 ) , there is evidence that some disk galaxies may truncate at @xmath474 scale  lengths , or change their exponential slope at these radii ( van der kruit 2001 ; pohlen et al.2004 ; erwin , beckman , & pohlen 2005 ) , but see narayan & jog ( 2003 ) and also bland - hawthorn et al .",
    "( 2005 ) who present a light ",
    "profile for the late  type disk galaxy ngc  300 which extends to 10 scale  lengths .",
    "figure  [ figpet4 ] thus provides a boundary of sorts to the extent that petrosian magnitudes may underestimate a galaxy s total magnitude as a function of the underlying profile shape . to avoid possible confusion",
    ", we note that @xmath15 shall always refer to the value associated with the @xmath6 model extended to infinity .",
    "thus , when the profile is assumed to truncate at 5@xmath15 , the value of @xmath15 does not change .",
    "one can see from figure  [ figpet4]a that the use of @xmath48=0.5 results in magnitude differences of 0.5 mag when @xmath49 ; 1.25 mag when @xmath50 ; 2 mag when @xmath51 and considerably worse for galaxies with yet higher values of @xmath16 .",
    "obviously such an approach to determine galaxy magnitudes should be used with caution .",
    "when dealing with dwarf galaxies , because of their faint central surface brightnesses , the sky flux can often dominate at the radius where @xmath1 .",
    "the use of @xmath52 is thus more practical , and for galaxies with @xmath53 the bulk of their flux is still recovered .",
    "overall , however , the use of @xmath1 does much better at recovering a galaxy s true magnitude has also been adopted by some authors because it results in a minimal variation of @xmath54 with @xmath16 . for @xmath55 ,",
    "this value is around 2 , and so to approximate the total light , one could measure the light within @xmath56 and multiply by 2 . ] . when @xmath16=4 , the magnitude difference profile rather than an @xmath50 profile .",
    "the value of 0.13 mag was based on photometry of iraf artdata simulations , and therefore is likely to be a round  off or discretization error in the iraf rendering . ]",
    "is only 0.20 mag , rising to 0.64 mag when @xmath57 .",
    "things are better for profiles with smaller values of @xmath16 and if one considers the profiles truncate at 5@xmath15 ( figure  [ figpet4]b ) .",
    "in this section we will only consider the case where @xmath32 , using @xmath0 to define the petrosian magnitude .",
    "the merits of this precise definition , which was used by the",
    "team , are exalted in strauss et al .",
    "( 2002 , their section 3.2 ) .      if one had some way of knowing the underlying light ",
    "profile shape ` @xmath16 ' , then from figure  [ figpet4 ] one could correct the petrosian magnitudes for the missing flux beyond @xmath0 .",
    "given that the petrosian index was developed in part to avoid fitting a model to an object s light ",
    "profile , one may prefer not to fit the @xmath6 model , or indeed one may not have the resolution to do so .",
    "conveniently , central light ` concentration ' is monotonically related to the shape of a light  profile ( trujillo , graham , & caon 2001a ; graham et al .",
    "one can therefore use concentration as a proxy for the value of @xmath16 .",
    "the _ sdss _ consortium have been using a ratio of two radii ( @xmath58 and @xmath59 ) as a measure of an object s concentration , both of which are available from the _ sdss _ public data releases .",

    "the use of such radii avoids the inner seeing  affected part of a light ",

    "the _ sdss _ consortium adopted a slightly modified form of the petrosian index .",
    "rather than dividing the average intensity within @xmath29 by the intensity at @xmath29 ( equation  [ eqpet ] ) , they divided the average intensity within @xmath29 by the average intensity within 0.81.25@xmath29 .",
    "this was done so as to reduce the sensitivity of the index to noise and ( possible ) real small  scale fluctuations in the light  profile ( strauss et al .",

    "in general , where the _ sdss _ petrosian index ( equation  [ petsdss ] ) equals 1/0.2 , the associated petrosian radii are slightly smaller than the radii obtained previously with equation  [ petper ] equal to 1/0.2 ( see table  [ table1 ] ) .",

    "that is to say , the apparent mis  match at high  concentrations is understood : it arises from the systematics which blanton et al .",
    "( 2005 ) identified in their fitted srsic quantities .",
    "figure  [ figdata]e reveals that the early  type galaxies , defined to be those with concentrations greater than 2.86 ( e.g. , shimasaku 2001 ; nakamura et al .  2003 ) , have petrosian surface brightnesses which are clearly brighter than the srsic  derived surface brightness .",
    "figure  [ figdata]f shows that the procedure does a good job at correcting for the missing flux beyond the petrosian apertures , at least until a concentration of around 3.3 where the selection boundary and the underestimation of the srsic flux once more come into play .",
    "another popular setup is that used in the cas system ( conselice 2003 ) , which measures the concentration ( c ) , asymmetry ( a ) , and stellar / star  forming clumpiness ( s ) of a galaxy s light distribution . within the cas code ,",
    "petrosian apertures have sizes of 1.5@xmath29 , with @xmath1 .",
    "concentration is also defined slightly differently from that used by the _ sdss _ consortium : it is the ratio of radii containing 80% and 20% ( rather than 90% and 50% ) of the flux within the petrosian aperture ( bershady et al .",
    "2000 ) .    theoretically ,",
    "it does nt matter what choice of radii one uses to define concentration . for example , radii containing 100% and 50% of the flux within the petrosian aperture would work . in practice ,",
    "the use of a large upper  percentage and a small lower  percentage leads to a greater range of concentrations and thus a clearer distinction between different profile types .",
    "however , not using too large an upper  percentage allows one to work with a less noisy part of the light  profile . not using too small a lower ",
    "percentage means that one is less vulnerable to the effects of seeing .",
    "an analysis of the optimal concentration index ( e.g. , graham et al .",
    "2001 ) is , however , beyond the intended scope of this paper and will be addressed elsewhere .",
    "we note that such a search need not be limited to differing percentages , but could include radii based on different values of the petrosian index . here",
    "we simply provide the corrections using the popular _ sdss _ and cas definitions for the concentration index and petrosian index / aperture .    the various size and flux transformation and corrective terms for the specific petrosian setup ( 1.5@xmath29 , with @xmath32 ) and concentration ( @xmath5 ) used by the cas code of conselice et al .",
    "( 2003 ) are given in the lower section of table  [ table1 ] .",
    "to approximate the total srsic magnitude , over a range in @xmath16 from 0.1 to 10 , this missing flux @xmath125 can be approximated by @xmath126 to obtain the flux within 5@xmath15 , the following provides a good approximation @xmath127 the effective srsic radius @xmath15 is given by @xmath128      caon et al .",
    "( 1993 ) have shown srsic s @xmath6 model fits early  type galaxies remarkably well ( see their figure  2 ) down to faint surface brightness levels ( @xmath129 mag arcsec@xmath130 ) .",
    "spiral galaxies , however , usually have two clearly distinct components , namely a bulge and a disk .",
    "it is therefore pertinent to inquire how the above corrections may apply when a galaxy is clearly better represented by two components , as is the case for the intermediate  type galaxies .",
    "when dealing with luminous galaxies , the rough divide between early  type and late  type galaxies has been taken to occur at @xmath131 @xmath132 ( shimasaku 2001 ; nakamura et al .",
    "2003 ; shen et al.2003 , using the _ sdss _ definition of petrosian index and aperture ) .",
    "( e.g. , blanton et al .",
    "2003b ) or @xmath133 ( e.g. , strateva et al .  2001",
    "; kauffman et al .",
    "2003 ) to mark the rough divide between luminous early and late  type galaxies . ]",
    "it should be kept in mind that this concentration based definition of galaxy type is only applicable to luminous systems .",
    "dwarf elliptical galaxies have exponential  like profiles and thus low concentrations ( e.g. , graham et al .",
    "2001 ; their figure 8) , but are obviously not late  type galaxies . the magnitude correction for galaxies having concentrations of this size or smaller is less than 0.06 mag ( table  [ table1 ] ) . in late  type galaxies , the exponential disk , rather than the bulge ,",
    "dominates the flux in the outer parts .",
    "whether or not these disks continue for many scale  lengths or truncate at a few scale  lengths , if one applies the corrections presented here , one will not over  correct the galaxy flux by more than 0.06 mag for the 2component late  type galaxies , nor overestimate the half  light radius by more than 7% ( table  [ table1 ] ) . if , however , one is able to identify the disk  dominated galaxies from their blue restframe colors , or indeed from their low concentrations ( assuming no low luminosity elliptical galaxies reside in one s sample , or folding in asymmetry to separate the galaxy classes ) , then one may instead elect to apply the small corrections applicable for systems with an @xmath16=1 ( exponential disk ) light  profile .",
    "given the corrections for such stellar distributions are small , a simple answer may then be to only apply the various corrections to the red galaxy population , or to systems with ( _ sdss _ ) concentrations greater than say 2.86 .",
    "we caution that intermediate objects , such as lenticular galaxies , with half their light coming from their disk and half from their bulge may not be well approximated with a single srsic profile . in such cases",
    "the concentration prescription given here should be used with care as it is intended for systems which can be approximated with a single srsic function .",
    "in general , however , section 4.1 and in particular figure  [ figdata ] reveal that the method developed here seems to work rather well .",
    "a different issue pertains to how one actually measures the petrosian index .",
    "for a disk system , the petrosian index is independent of disk inclination if one uses appropriate elliptical apertures reflecting the inclination of the disk .",
    "if one instead measures the index from the slope of the major  axis light  profile , such that @xmath134/d[\\ln r]$ ] ( gunn & oke 1975 ) , then again the index is not dependent on the inclination of the disk .",
    "however , the use of circular apertures applied to highly  inclined disk galaxies will result in erroneously high concentrations compared to what these values would be if such galaxies were viewed with a face  on orientation . although we have not quantified this effect , comparisons between eye  ball morphology and concentration index yields reasonable agreement for the late - type galaxies ( e.g. , shimasaku et al .",
    "2001 ) , suggesting that in practice this effect is not a significant problem .",
    "lastly , we note that if image distortion due to seeing is not corrected for and is such that the psf has altered the petrosian 50% radius @xmath59 and thus @xmath4 ( or @xmath5 ) to the extent that the measured value no longer reflects the intrinsic galaxy concentration , then obviously one should not be including such objects in plots or analyses that use this quantity .",
    "the concentration  based corrections outlined in this study can not be applied in such circumstances , at least until the radii are corrected for seeing ( e.g. , trujillo et al .  2001b , c ) we also direct readers to blanton et al .",
    "( 2001 ) who present a study of how the _ sdss _ petrosian magnitudes are affected by seeing , and wirth et al .",
    "( 1994 ) who considered the affects of both poor image resolution and low signal  to  noise on image concentration .",
    "in commenting on the adopted petrosian system of the _ sdss _ consortium , strauss et al .",
    "( 2002 ) wrote : `` any scientific analysis that uses the [ sdss ] redshift survey must consider how the fact that a different fraction of light is included for elliptical and spiral galaxies affects the result '' .",
    "this was both a recognition that a ) their particular petrosian system likely captures a different fraction of galaxy light compared to other surveys and that b ) any practical definition of petrosian parameters will inevitably miss some fraction of a galaxy s light , and a different fraction in different galaxies .",
    "for example , a galaxy with an exponential light  profile will have 99% of its total flux encompassed by the _ sdss _",
    "petrosian magnitude , but if a galaxy has an @xmath2 profile , then the flux beyond the _ sdss _ petrosian aperture accounts for an additional 0.22 mag , i.e. , roughly 1/5 th of that galaxy s total light . in this paper",
    "we outline a simple method for accurately recovering the missed flux .",
    "differences between galaxy light ",
    "profile shapes result in a range of galaxy concentrations .",
    "we have shown how these can be used to correct for the flux outside of the petrosian apertures and thus provide a galaxy s total ( srsic ) magnitude .",
    "the corrections presented here hold to the extent that srsic s @xmath6 model provides a good description of the various galaxy light",
    " profiles . for early ",
    "type galaxies this is known to be the case ( e.g. , caon et al .",
    "1993 ) , while for late  type galaxies the correction is @xmath1350.06 mag and one can argue whether or not to apply it .    for typical elliptical galaxies , petrosian magnitudes can fall shy of the total magnitude by a couple of tenths of a magnitude .",
    "application of our method to the _ sdss _ petrosian magnitudes yielded total ( srsic ) magnitudes accurate to a couple of hundredths of a magnitude .",
    "moreover , it actually provided a more accurate measurement of this quantity than obtained from direct srsic fits to the data ( blanton et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "we have shown how the galaxy concentration can also be used to determine the effective half  light radius @xmath15 from the petrosian radius @xmath29 , and thereby additionally leading to a determination of the associated surface brightness terms .",
    "we also provide magnitude corrections under the assumption that galaxy light ",
    "profiles truncate at 5 effective radii .    in regard to the _ sdss _ data , blanton et al .",
    "( 2005 ) showed how their srsic fits to objects with increasingly higher values of @xmath16 resulted in increasingly underestimated effective radii .",
    "for example , their code obtained radii that were @xmath4780% of the true effective radii for simulated objects with @xmath136 ( @xmath122 ) . due to this , the concentration  corrected effective radii derived from the petrosian 50% radii are in fact preferable to those obtained from the direct srsic fits .",
    "the same is obviously true for the associated surface brightness terms .",
    "in passing we warn that the use of @xmath137 , with @xmath52 , misses more than half of an @xmath2 profile s flux and should therefore not be used in the analysis of bright elliptical galaxies .",
    "the use of @xmath0 , with @xmath1 , as justified by the _ sdss _ consortium , is suitably appropriate .",
    "the optimal choice of concentration remains an outstanding issue . while the corrective scheme outlined here is general to any choice of petrosian index and aperture , the tabulated values we have provided are specific to two commonly used petrosian systems , namely that used by cas ( conselice 2003 ) and the setup adopted by the sdss collaboration ( york et al .",
