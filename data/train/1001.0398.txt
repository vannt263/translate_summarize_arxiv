    "decoherence is the quantum phenomenon by which the coherence of a quantum system can be destroyed when it is put in contact with a large environment @xcite .",
    "the schredinger equation is a linear differential equation , consequently any linear combination of solutions is also a solution of the problem .",
    "thus , a general possible quantum state is a superposition of quantum states .",
    "nevertheless , such a state does not appear in the classical macroscopic world .",
    "the decoherence interpretation of quantum mechanics @xcite claims that this is due to the interaction with the environment , which destroys the quantum correlations between the states of the system , making it to transite from a quantum superposition state to a classical - like mixture of states .",
    "moreover , only a small set of states take part of the classical - like mixture ; they are called _ pointer states _ @xcite .",
    "the study of decoherence is important for several reasons : i ) it might be responsible for the emergence of classical properties out of the underlying quantum nature of the physical systems , ii ) it is a major problem for the construction of a quantum computer since it will produce the loss of the necessary quantum entanglement .",
    "thus , both for fundamental reasons ( i ) and for practical purposes ( ii ) it is important to characterize the decoherence process and its effects on the physical properties of a quantum system .",
    "along this line of study , it is important to address the issue of the effect produced in the coherence of a quantum state when the environment evolves between different quantum phases .",
    "there have been several works on the relation between decoherence and an environmental quantum phase transition @xcite .",
    "recently , we have presented a novel phenomenon in which the decoherence of the system suffers drammatic changes when the environment crosses an excited state quantum phase transition ( esqpt)@xcite . an esqpt is a nonanalytic evolution of the system as the control parameters in the hamiltonian vary .",
    "it is similar to a ground state quantum phase transition but affecting to excited states .",
    "correspondingly , an esqpt can be classified in the thermodynamic limit as first order , when a crossing between two excited levels is present , or continuous , when the number of interacting levels is locally very large at an excited energy but without crossings .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we presented briefly the case of a qubit in interaction with an environment modelled as a two - level boson system undergoing a continuous esqpt .",
    "we used a particular simple hamiltonian in terms of single control parameter to model the environment in order to show the main effect . here",
    "we present a more extensive study of a similar system including both first and second order esqpt , and more general sets of parameters . together with the exact evolution of the system",
    ", we present a simple mean field treatment .",
    "we show that the decoherence is maximal when the interaction of the system with the environment produces second order esqpt , while no noticeable effects are observed in the case of a first order esqpt . for the former case ,",
    "a finite - size scaling analysis allows us to postulate that the fidelity goes to zero as soon as the interaction between system and environment is switched on .",
    "we also show that mean field treatment provides a good description for the decoherence of the small system , except around the critical points .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in sect .",
    "ii , we present the model for the environment and study the phase diagram and its relation with the density of energy levels .",
    "we then discuss the interaction of the environment with the system . in sect .",
    "iii we show results for the decoherence factor .",
    "both exact numerical results for large boson number , and an analytic mean field method with simple extensions of the tamm - dankoff approximation are presented . in sect .",
    "iv , results for the decoherence factor in the case of continuous and first order esqpt , including a finite size scaling study for the decoherence factor ( or fidelity ) , are discussed . finally , in sect .",
    "v we summarize giving the main conclusions of this work .",
    "following @xcite , we will consider our system composed by a spin @xmath0 particle coupled to a spin environment by the hamiltonian @xmath1 , @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the two components of the spin @xmath0 system , and @xmath5 , @xmath6 the couplings of each component to the environment .",
    "the three terms @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 act on the hilbert space of the environment ; therefore , it evolves with an effective hamiltonian depending on the state of the central spin @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "the term @xmath12 makes it possible that the environment crosses a critical point as a consequence of the interaction with the central spin @xcite .",
    "considering the initial state @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the initial state of the environment , the evolved reduced density matrix of the system is @xmath15    the off - diagonal terms of the density matrix are modulated by the decoherence factor @xmath16 which is the overlap between two states of the environment obtained by evolving the initial state @xmath17 with two different hamiltonians ,    @xmath18    if the environment is initially in the ground state of @xmath19 , @xmath20 , the decoherence factor , up to an irrelevant phase factor , is @xmath21 this quantity has the same form as the loschmidt echo or the fidelity , and it contains all the relevant information about the decoherence process .    to be more specific ,",
    "let us introduce as an environment a two - level boson system described by a generalized lipkin model , whose hamiltonian is    @xmath22    where the operators @xmath23 and @xmath24 are defined as    @xmath25    in terms of two species of scalar bosons @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath28 and @xmath29 are two independent control parameters , and the total number of bosons @xmath30 is a conserved quantity .",
    "it is worth to mention that this two - level bosonic hamiltonian is completely equivalent to an su(2 ) spin hamiltonian , with long - range spin exchange interaction .",
    "the equivalence is defined by the inverse schwinger representation of the su(2 ) generators @xmath31 where @xmath32 represents the total spin of a chain of @xmath33 1/2 spins .      in order to study the phase diagram of the hamiltonian ( [ eq:1 ] ) as a function of the control parameters @xmath28 and @xmath29",
    ", it is usual to rely on a coherent state of the form @xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes the boson vacuum .",
    "the corresponding energy surface as a function of the variational parameter @xmath36 is the expectation value of @xmath7 ( [ eq:1 ] ) in the coherent state ( [ eq:3 ] )    @xmath37 \\big\\ } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    minimization of the energy ( [ eq:4 ] ) with respect to @xmath36 , for given values of the control parameters @xmath28 and @xmath29 , gives the equilibrium value @xmath38 defining the phase of the system in the ground state .",
    "the value @xmath39 corresponds to the symmetric phase , and @xmath40 to the broken symmetry phase .",
    "this hamiltonian has a second order quantum phase transition ( qpt ) along the line @xmath41 , and a first order qpt for @xmath42 . in the latter ,",
    "the critical point is defined as the situation in which the minimum in the symmetric phase and in the broken symmetry phase are degenerate and their energies are equal to zero .",
    "the study of the phase diagram has been done in several publications @xcite . here",
    "we summarize its main features .",
    "* @xmath43 is always a stationary point . for @xmath44 ,",
    "the solution with @xmath43 is a maximum for @xmath45 , and becomes a minimum for @xmath46 . in the case of @xmath47",
    ", @xmath43 is an inflection point .",
    "@xmath47 is the point in which a minimum at @xmath43 starts to develop and defines the antispinodal line . * for @xmath48",
    "there exists a region where two minima , one spherical and one deformed , coexist .",
    "this region is defined by the point where the @xmath43 minimum appears ( antispinodal point ) and the point where the @xmath49 minimum appears ( spinodal point ) .",
    "the spinodal line is defined by the implicit equation , @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "for example , for @xmath53 , @xmath54 .",
    "* in the coexistence region , the critical point is defined by the condition that both minima ( spherical and deformed ) are degenerate . at the critical point",
    "the two degenerated minima are at @xmath55 and @xmath56 , and their energy is equal to zero . the critical line is therefore defined as @xmath57 for example , for @xmath53 , @xmath58 . *",
    "according to the previous analysis , for @xmath59 there appears a first - order phase transition , while for @xmath60 there is an isolated point of second - order phase transition at @xmath47 . in this case ,",
    "antispinodal , spinodal and critical points collapse to a single point .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fases ] we present a schematic view of the phase diagram for the environment hamiltonian @xmath7 ( [ eq:1 ] ) in the @xmath61 plane .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ eq:1 ] ) also displays an excited state quantum phase transition ( esqpt ) , which is analogous to a standard quantum phase transition , but taking place at some excited critical energy @xmath62 of the system .",
    "we can distinguish between different kinds of esqpts . as it is stated in @xcite , in the thermodynamic limit",
    "a crossing of two levels at @xmath63 determines a first order esqpt , while if the number of interacting levels is locally large at @xmath63 but without real crossings , the esqpt is continuous .",
    "as the entropy of a quantum system is related to its density of states , a relationship between an esqpt and a standard phase transition at a certain critical temperature can be established in the thermodynamic limit @xcite .",
    "these kinds of phase transitions have been identified in the lipkin model @xcite , in the interacting boson model @xcite , and in more general boson or fermion two - level pairing hamiltonians ( for a complete discussion , including a semiclassical analysis , see @xcite ) . in all these cases",
    ", the esqpt takes place beyond the critical value of the hamiltonian control parameter , implying that the critical point moves from the ground state to an excited state .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     in fig .",
    "[ fig : exponentes ] we show how @xmath64 evolves with the size @xmath33 of the environment , both for @xmath60 and several values of @xmath28 ( left panel ) , and @xmath65 and several values of @xmath66 .",
    "in all the cases , a power - law scaling @xmath67 is observed , and therefore we can expect that @xmath68 in the thermodynamical limit @xmath69 .",
    "nevertheless , subtle differences between verying @xmath28 with @xmath60 and varying @xmath29 with @xmath65 are observed . the results for the exponent @xmath70 , shown in tab .",
    "[ tab : exponentes ] , are very close to the proposed @xmath71 @xcite for @xmath60 .",
    "however , the numerical estimates seem to increase for larger values of @xmath29 ; in particular , for the case @xmath72 , the result for exponent @xmath70 is significatively larger than @xmath73 .",

    "[ fig : energia ] . inserting this value in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lambdac ] ) a critical coupling @xmath90 is obtained . for the case @xmath65 and @xmath53 the first order eqspt is obtained at @xmath91 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:1st ] we show the exact result for the decoherence factor @xmath92 for @xmath65 , @xmath53 , and three different values of @xmath93 around @xmath94 .",
    "the most significative result is that no trace of critical phenomena are observed in @xmath95  the shape of this magnitude is smooth around @xmath96 .",
    "moreover , fig .",
    "[ fig : rmax ] confirms that @xmath97 also behaves in a smooth an size - independent way .",
    "the conclusion is , thus , that the first - order esqpt does not affect the decoherence induced in the central qubit .",
    "the decoherence induced in a single qubit by its interaction with the environment , modelled as a scalar two - level boson model , is studied . the environment presents a quantum phase transition from symmetric to non - symetric phases at around @xmath47 , which can be first order ( @xmath98 ) or second order ( @xmath60 ) . in the non - symmetric phase , the environment also presents excited state quantum phase transitions ( esqpts ) : a second order one for any @xmath29 value at @xmath99 , and also a first order one for @xmath98 at an energy @xmath100 .",
    "we have shown that the second order esqpt affects dramatically the decoherence factor which goes rapidly to zero .",
    "a finite size scaling study shows that in that case the decoherence factor goes to zero at the critical point following a power law . on the other hand",

    "we have also shown that a mean field treatment provides a good description of the decoherence factor @xmath16 , except in the regions around the critical points .",
