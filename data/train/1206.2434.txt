    "the major issue in studying low - mass ellipticals ( @xmath12 ) is their relatively x - ray faint nature . in particular ,",
    "the observed x - ray emission from low - mass elliptical galaxies is dominated by the populations of resolved and unresolved compact x - ray sources . besides the populations of compact objects , emission from hot x - ray gas",
    "may also be present , the detection of which may be compromised by the underlying emission from unresolved compact objects .",
    "moreover , given the shallow potential well of such galaxies , the hot x - ray emitting gas may not be in a stationary state .",
    "sne ia might be energetically capable of driving galactic - scale outflows @xcite . in agreement with this result",
    ", a galactic - scale outflow had been detected in the bulge of m31 @xcite and in the sombrero galaxy @xcite .",
    "= 8.5 cm = 8.5 cm = 8.5 cm = 8.5 cm    [ fig : img ]    detailed x - ray studies of the milky way and nearby galaxies have led to a better understanding of the origin of the resolved and the unresolved x - ray emission . with the superior angular resolution of _ chandra _ , the population of bright low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) could be studied in detail ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , it has been established that ( at least ) a portion of unresolved x - ray emission is associated with the stellar population and is the superposition of a multitude of faint compact sources , such as active binaries ( abs ) and cataclysmic variables ( cvs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , if sufficiently deep _ chandra _",
    "observations are available , then the various x - ray emitting components can be identified in nearby galaxies , hence the diffuse emission from hot x - ray gas can be separated from the population of resolved and faint unresolved compact objects",
    ". this extensive knowledge permits us to determine whether low - mass ellipticals host x - ray emitting gas and , additionally , to address the state of the hot gas .    in the present paper ,",
    "we study four elliptical galaxies , whose optical appearances are nearly identical , yet their x - ray properties are strikingly different .",
    "the four galaxies , ngc821 , ngc3379 , ngc4278 , and ngc4697 , are relatively nearby ( @xmath13 mpc ) and have deep _ chandra _ observations ( figure [ fig : img ] ) .",
    "therefore , we are able to identify and remove the bulk of the x - ray emission from lmxbs , hence bright point sources do not significantly contaminate the diffuse emission .",
    "furthermore , the low and stable instrumental background of _ chandra _ permits us to reliably study low surface brightness emission .",
    "the goals of this paper are twofold .",
    "first , we aim to unveil whether the sample galaxies host a significant amount of hot x - ray emitting gas .",
    "second , if they do possess x - ray gas , we intend to measure its properties , morphology , and understand its physical state .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     _ note .",

    "to determine whether the sample galaxies host a notable amount of hot x - ray gas , we use three different approaches , discussed throughout this section .",
    "first , we compare the surface brightness distribution of the soft ( @xmath19 kev ) band unresolved x - ray emission with that of the k - band light .",
    "since the distribution of the faint compact objects follows the stellar light , a deviation from the k - band profile may indicate the presence of hot gas .",
    "second , we compute x - ray - to - k - band luminosity ( @xmath16 ) ratios of the unresolved x - ray emission in the @xmath14 kev energy band and compare these with values obtained for admittedly gas - free galaxies and the milky way . an @xmath16 ratio significantly exceeding that of gas - free galaxies will demonstrate the presence of excess x - ray emission , presumably originating from hot gas .",
    "finally , we extract x - ray energy spectra of the sample galaxies . if hot x - ray gas is present , then its physical properties can be measured by spectral fitting .      to construct x - ray surface brightness distributions of the unresolved emission",
    ", we extracted profiles in the @xmath19 kev energy range using circular annuli centered on the centroid of each galaxy . for each profile ,",
    "detected sources were excluded , a vignetting correction was applied , and the background level was subtracted .",
    "the x - ray light distribution is compared with the k - band profiles . to obtain the k - band profiles ,",
    "the same regions were used and the same source regions were excluded .",
    "the k - band profiles are normalized to approximately match the level of x - ray emission . although the normalization of the k - band profiles is arbitrary , the particular choice for ngc4278 and ngc4697 was motivated by the spatial distribution of the diffuse x - ray emission , discussed in section [ sec : morphology ] .",
    "the resulting profiles are shown in figure [ fig : profile ] .",
    "figure [ fig : profile ] demonstrates that in two galaxies , ngc3379 and ngc821 , the x - ray light is well traced by the stellar light distribution at all radii .",
    "the good agreement between the x - ray and k - band profiles hints that the unresolved x - ray emission in these galaxies has a stellar origin , that is , it originates from the multitude of faint compact objects .",
    "however , in ngc4278 and ngc4697 , the distribution of the x - ray light shows deviations from the near - infrared profiles . in particular , the unresolved x - ray emission in ngc4278 has a steeper distribution in the central regions than the stellar light , whereas at larger radii it follows the k - band profile .",
    "thus , an excess x - ray emitting component is present within the central regions of ngc4278 . in ngc4697 ,",
    "the x - ray light exhibits a significantly broader distribution than the stellar light .",
    "this suggests that the bulk of the unresolved soft band x - ray emission arises from the excess x - ray emitting component , which is present at all radii .",
    "the nature and properties of the excess x - ray emitting components in ngc4278 and ngc4697 are extensively discussed in the following sections .      in old stellar populations ,",
    "the @xmath16 ratio for the population of faint compact objects is fairly uniform , and is in the range of @xmath20 @xcite . by computing the @xmath16 ratios for the sample galaxies",
    ", we can determine whether the unresolved x - ray emission is dominated by faint compact and stellar sources or if other x - ray emitting components also play a role .    to compute the @xmath16 ratios for each galaxy",
    ", we extracted x - ray energy spectra of the @xmath15 regions with detected point sources excluded . the spectra were described with a two component model consisting of an optically - thin thermal plasma emission model ( apec in xspec ) and a power law model .",
    "the abundances were left free to vary , whereas the column density was fixed at the galactic value @xcite . from the best - fit spectra , we computed the total @xmath14 kev x - ray luminosity , which was used to derive the @xmath16 ratio for the @xmath15 regions .",
    "however , the measured x - ray luminosities do not only reflect the luminosity of the undetected faint compact objects and possible hot gas , but are also contaminated by two other factors .",
    "first , a relatively small fraction ( @xmath21 ) of the detected source counts falls outside the source cells and contributes to the unresolved emission , which must be taken into account .",
    "second , the available _ chandra _ exposures do not allow us to resolve all lmxbs . therefore , the contribution of unresolved lmxbs must also be subtracted . to account for these contaminating factors ,",
    "we follow the techniques described in @xcite .",
    "the residual counts from the detected sources are subtracted on a source - by - source basis , whereas the contribution of unresolved lmxbs is removed using the average lmxb luminosity function @xcite .",
    "the observed and contamination subtracted @xmath14 kev band x - ray luminosities , the k - band luminosity , and the resulting @xmath16 ratios are listed in table [ tab : list3 ] . in the same table",
    "we also list the ratios for the gas - free compact elliptical galaxy , m32 @xcite , and the solar neighborhood @xcite .",
    "the contamination - subtracted @xmath16 ratios obtained for ngc821 and ngc3379 are in the range of @xmath22 , in good agreement with the ratios observed for m32 and for the solar neighborhood .",
    "however , in ngc4278 and ngc4697 , we observe @xmath23 , a factor @xmath2@xmath24 times larger than that obtained for gas - free systems .",
    "thus , based on the @xmath16 ratios , the unresolved emission in ngc821 and ngc3379 is dominated by the population of faint compact objects , whereas in ngc4278 and ngc4697 , an additional x - ray emitting component is present , presumably originating from x - ray gas .",
    "based on the observed @xmath14 kev band @xmath16 ratios , we estimate that the contribution of faint unresolved sources is @xmath2@xmath25 in ngc4278 and @xmath2@xmath26 in ngc4697 , implying that the hot x - ray gas is predominant at energies below @xmath2@xmath27 kev .",
    "= 8.5 cm    [ fig : ratio_ngc4278 ]    [ fig : ratio_ngc4697 ]      to confirm the presence of hot x - ray gas in ngc4278 and ngc4697 , we extracted their x - ray energy spectra and compared them to those derived for the gas - free galaxies ngc821 and ngc3379 .",
    "the spectra , shown in figure [ fig : spectra ] , are extracted from within the @xmath15 regions . to facilitate the comparison of the observed spectra , we normalize the spectra to the k - band luminosity of @xmath28 and the distance of @xmath29 mpc .",
    "bright point sources are excluded and all background components are subtracted from the depicted spectra .",
    "the spectra demonstrate that ngc4278 and ngc4697 host a prominent soft component at energies @xmath30 kev , whereas this component is about an order - of - magnitude weaker in ngc821 and ngc3379 .",
    "we stress that the weak soft component in the spectra of ngc821 and ngc3379 is most likely due to the soft x - ray spectra of abs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "above @xmath2@xmath31 kev energy , the spectra are in fairly good agreement with each other , which is also confirmed by the @xmath32 kev band @xmath16 ratios @xcite .",
    "to characterize the physical properties of the hot gas , we use two approaches . as a first approach",
    ", we fit the spectra with a simple two component model , consisting of an optically - thin thermal plasma emission model ( apec in xspec ) and a power law component . during the fitting procedure ,",
    "the column density is fixed at the galactic value ( table [ tab : list2 ] ) , whereas the abundance is set free . in ngc4278 ,",
    "the best - fit temperature and abundances of the apec models are @xmath33 kev and @xmath34 of the solar values @xcite .",
    "using the same model for ngc4697 , the best - fit temperature and abundances of the thermal model are @xmath35 kev and @xmath36 of solar @xcite .",
    "this simple two component model gives an acceptable fit for the x - ray spectra of both galaxies , thereby confirming that the notable fraction of the soft band emission originates from hot gas .",
    "however , this two component model does not take into account that a small but certain fraction of the soft band emission arises from the population of unresolved faint compact objects .    as a second approach",
    ", we use the spectrum of ngc3379 as a template to describe the x - ray emission originating from faint unresolved sources .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of ngc3379 can be described with the combination of a thermal and a power law component , where the apec model has a temperature of @xmath37 kev and solar abundance , whereas the slope of the power law is @xmath38 .",
    "we employ this template spectrum and rescale it by the k - band luminosity within the spectral extraction regions to account for the x - ray emission associated with abs and cvs in ngc4278 and ngc4697 .",
    "thus , the spectrum of ngc4278 and ngc4697 is fit with a four component model , which comprises two thermal and two power law models .",
    "one thermal and one power law component describes the emission arising from abs and cvs , therefore the parameters of these models are fixed at the values deduced from the ngc3379 spectrum and are scaled according to the k - band light of the given regions .",
    "the second power law component accounts for the emission originating from unresolved lmxbs in ngc4278 and ngc4697 .",
    "we emphasize that in the soft band the emission associated with the power law models does not play a dominant role . indeed , in the @xmath19 kev band , @xmath39 of the total flux originates from the power law components .",
    "the parameters of the hot gas associated with ngc4278 and ngc4697 are described with the second thermal model .",
    "interestingly , the derived best - fit gas temperature of ngc4278 is @xmath40 kev , which is significantly lower than that obtained with the simple two component models and is in good agreement with that measured by @xcite . in the case of ngc4697 ,",
    "the best - fit temperature is @xmath41 kev , being in good agreement with the previously measured value .",
    "we also note that the best - fit abundances remained essentially unchanged , that is , both ngc4278 and ngc4697 exhibit strongly sub - solar abundances .",
    "the difference in the observed gas temperatures in ngc4278 is most likely due to its gas - poor nature .",
    "indeed , in ngc4278 , @xmath2@xmath25 of the @xmath14 kev band luminosity arises from the population of cvs and abs , which adds a notable contribution to the observed thermal emission .",
    "therefore , when fitting the x - ray spectrum with a simple two component model consisting of one thermal plasma model and one power law model , the best - fit temperature of the thermal model is the weighted average temperature of the truly diffuse gaseous emission and the unresolved faint compact objects ( for further discussion see section [ sec : metal ] ) .",
    "when two distinct thermal models are applied , their temperatures are not averaged , which in the case of ngc4278 results in a lower temperature for the truly diffuse gaseous emission . obviously , this effect is less significant in more gas - rich galaxies , such as ngc4697 , where the emission from unresolved cvs and abs plays a lesser role . in further discussions ,",
    "we employ the above - discussed four component spectral model , that is we take into account the contribution of faint unresolved sources to the x - ray emission .",
    "= 8.5 cm = 8.5 cm    [ fig : wedges ]      in ngc3379 , we did not detect notable x - ray emission from hot ionized gas , in agreement with the results of @xcite . however , our conclusions are in conflict with those of @xcite , who claimed that ngc3379 hosts x - ray emitting gas within the central @xmath42 . in principle , it is possible that the applied point source exclusion regions by @xcite were too small , and the excess emission in the central regions is due to `` spill - over '' counts from bright point sources . within the central @xmath43 circular region ,",
    "we detect @xmath44 source counts in the @xmath14 kev band , of which @xmath45 are associated with bright point sources , if @xmath46 aperture radii are used as in @xcite .",
    "that is , only @xmath47 counts , or @xmath48@xmath49 of the total counts , could be associated with the diffuse emission within the central @xmath43 region .",
    "since , on - axis , the applied @xmath46 source aperture encircles @xmath2@xmath50 of the point spread function for @xmath51 kev energy , the number of `` spill - over '' counts from point sources is @xmath2@xmath52 within the central @xmath43 .",
    "thus , @xmath2@xmath53 of the unresolved counts are likely to be associated with bright point sources rather than truly diffuse emission .",
    "finally , we also mention that @xmath48@xmath54 of the source counts originate from the nuclear source in ngc3379 , hence the fraction of `` spill - over '' counts is most significant in the central @xmath2@xmath55 region .",
    "therefore , to avoid being dominated by the source counts falling outside the source cells , we excluded the central @xmath56 of ngc3379 throughout this study .",
    "= 8.5 cm = 8.5 cm    [ fig : temperature ]      having demonstrated the presence of hot gas in ngc4278 and ngc4697 , we intend to map its morphology . understanding",
    "the spatial distribution of the gas may provide important hints about its physical state .",
    "we use two techniques to determine the morphology of the gas .",
    "first , we produce a ratio image of the @xmath19 kev band x - ray image and the k - band image .",
    "the x - ray - to - k - band ratio image allows us to only study the distribution of the hot gas , since other x - ray emitting components  whose luminosity is proportional with the k - band light ",
    "are removed .",
    "however , this procedure has certain weaknesses : in regions where the x - ray emission is not associated with the k - band light , the ratio image may have very large values ; and due to the strongly processed nature of the images , the central few arcsec regions can not be trusted . to gain insight into the distribution of the hot gas , we prepared both the x - ray and the k - band images .",
    "in particular , we excluded the resolved x - ray sources from the _ chandra _ images , and filled their locations with the local emission level applying the dmfilth task of ciao . moreover , the x - ray images are vignetting corrected , the estimated background level is subtracted , and adaptive smoothing is applied using the ciao csmooth tool . the k - band images were smoothed by convolving them with a gaussian .",
    "the applied smoothing widths are comparable to the typical smoothing widths near the center of the x - ray images .",
    "the obtained ratio images are renormalized , and the highest pixel value is assigned the value of @xmath57 .",
    "the x - ray - to - k - band ratio images for ngc4278 and ngc4697 are depicted in figure [ fig : ratio_ngc4278 ] and figure [ fig : ratio_ngc4697 ] , respectively .",
    "for ngc4278 we show the central @xmath58 region , where the hot x - ray emitting gas is most prominent .",
    "figure [ fig : ratio_ngc4278 ] demonstrates that the gas distribution in ngc4278 significantly deviates from the stellar light : the x - ray emission is strongly elongated in the northeast - southwest direction , which may indicate the presence of a galactic - scale outflow .",
    "figure [ fig : ratio_ngc4697 ] shows the x - ray - to - k - band ratio image for ngc4697 . since the x - ray gas has a broad distribution in ngc4697 , we studied the central @xmath59 region .",
    "we note that @xmath2@xmath60 of the stellar light is confined within this region .",
    "the ratio image confirms that the hot gas is significantly more extended than the stellar light .",
    "however , besides the broad gas distribution , we did not detect any notable asymmetries associated with the gas distribution .    as a second approach",
    ", we produce x - ray surface brightness distribution profiles of the @xmath19 kev band unresolved emission using circular wedges ( figure [ fig : wedges ] ) .",
    "the profiles are obtained in the same way as described in section [ sec : profiles ] .",
    "the x - ray profiles are compared with the k - band light distributions , whose normalization agrees with those applied in figure [ fig : profile ] .",
    "the major advantage of this method is that we deal with the original x - ray and k - band images , which are not affected by the various processing procedures .",
    "therefore , these profiles can confirm our findings based on the x - ray - to - k - band ratio images .",
    "since the hot gas is centrally concentrated in ngc4278 , the inner and outer radii of the applied annulus is @xmath61 .",
    "the left panel of figure [ fig : wedges ] confirms the bipolar distribution of the hot ionized gas : the soft band x - ray emission has two major peaks , namely at the position angles of @xmath62 and @xmath63 , which correspond to the northeast and southwest directions . in the right panel of figure [ fig : wedges ] , we show the surface brightness profiles for ngc4697 , which were obtained for a circular annulus with inner and outer radii of @xmath64 .",
    "as expected from the x - ray - to - k - band image , the x - ray profiles are approximately uniformly higher than the k - band profiles at every position angle .",
    "thus , the profiles do not unveil any major asymmetries associated with the x - ray light distribution .",
    "the bipolar distribution ( figure [ fig : ratio_ngc4278 ] ) of the hot gas in ngc4278 suggests that it is not in hydrostatic equilibrium , but more likely in an outflow state . in principle , galactic - scale outflows can be driven by the energy input of sne ia and the outflowing mass can be replenished by stellar yields from evolved stars @xcite . to explore whether a galactic - scale outflow can be sustained in ngc4278",
    ", we investigate the mass and energy budget of the galaxy .    since the x - ray gas is most luminous in the central regions of the galaxy , we use two rectangular boxes with @xmath65 ( @xmath66 kpc ) that are coincident with the elongated features detected in the x - ray - to - k - band image ( figure [ fig : ratio_ngc4278 ] ) . for further computations ,",
    "we assume that the path length of the gas is @xmath67 kpc .",
    "we extract a combined spectrum from these regions , which also confirms the thermal nature of the emission .",

    ", we estimate that the gas mass within the studied volume is @xmath2@xmath70 , the average number density is @xmath71 , and the cooling time is @xmath72 years .    given the parameters of the x - ray gas , we investigate whether the stellar yields from evolved stars can maintain the outflow .",
    "the average stellar yield in elliptical galaxies is @xmath73@xmath74 @xcite .",
    "the k - band luminosity of the cylindrical shell is @xmath75 , and hence the mass loss rate is @xmath76 .",
    "thus , the stellar yields are able to produce the observed gas mass in a timescale of @xmath2@xmath77 years , which is shorter , but comparable with the cooling time of the gas .",
    "the observed low gas mass and the short replenishment time of the gas indicates that the stellar yields from evolved stars are not retained in the galaxy , but are removed in the form of a galactic - scale outflow .",
    "= 8.5 cm = 8.5 cm    [ fig : massprofile ]    if the gas is outflowing from the galaxy , sne ia are likely candidates to drive the outflow . therefore , we compute whether the energy input from sne ia is sufficient to sustain the outflow .",
    "the frequency of sne ia in old stellar populations , such as ngc4278 , is proportional to the stellar mass and hence to the k - band luminosity of the galaxy .",
    "indeed , @xcite observed an sn ia frequency of @xmath78 for e and s0 galaxies , where @xmath79 per century .",
    "based on the k - band luminosity of the selected regions , the estimated average sn ia rate is @xmath80 .",
    "assuming that the average energy output of one sn ia is @xmath81 , we estimate that at most @xmath82 is available to heat the gas and drive the outflow .",
    "the required power to drive the outflow can be computed as @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the stellar mass loss rate and @xmath85 is the velocity dispersion of the galaxy @xcite . using the velocity dispersion of ngc4278 ( @xmath86  @xcite ; hyperleda ) and the stellar mass - loss rate ( @xmath76 ) , we estimate that @xmath87 is needed to drive the outflow .",
    "the gas shed by evolved stars is shock heated to the virial temperature of @xmath88 kev , adopting @xmath89 .",
    "this value is approximately consistent with the observed x - ray gas temperature .",
    "therefore , the total power required to drive the outflow is @xmath90 , which is @xmath2@xmath91 of that available from sne ia .",
    "thus , we confirm that sne ia are capable of sustaining a galactic - scale outflow in ngc4278 .    although the energy input of sne ia can sustain a galactic - scale wind , in principle it is possible that the central supermassive black hole also plays a role in driving the outflow .",
    "ngc4278 hosts a low - luminosity active galactic nucleus ( agn ) , which at present is in outburst , exhibiting a parsec scale radio jet @xcite .",
    "the estimated black hole mass of ngc4278 based on the @xmath92 relation @xcite and the velocity dispersion of the galaxy ( @xmath86 ) is @xmath2@xmath93 . assuming that the outflow is driven by the energy input of a preceding agn outburst",
    ", we estimate the occurrence time of the presumed outburst . based on the x - ray surface brightness profile ( figure [ fig : profile ] )",
    ", the outflow may extend to @xmath2@xmath94 ( @xmath2@xmath95 kpc ) .",
    "if the gas moves with the sound speed , which in a @xmath96 kev plasma is @xmath97 , then adopting @xmath98 and @xmath89 , we derive that the outburst occurred @xmath2@xmath99 years ago .",
    "however , two observational flaws make this proposed interpretation unlikely . first , if an outburst happened @xmath2@xmath99 years ago , the detection of radio emission associated with the outburst would be likely .",
    "however , in the 1.4 ghz very large array observation of ngc4278 , only the nucleus is detected , but no extended radio emission is observed .",
    "second , agn outbursts produce x - ray cavities in the hot gas distribution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "our _ chandra _ images do not reveal such cavities .",
    "instead , the morphology of the x - ray gas is consistent with a bipolar galactic - scale outflow ( figure [ fig : ratio_ngc4278 ] ) .",
    "we thus conclude that the galactic - scale outflow in ngc4278 is most likely driven by the energy input of the population of sne ia .    based on the detection of an sn",
    "ia driven outflow in ngc4278 , we can constrain the supernova efficiency parameter ( @xmath100 ) , which is the percentage of the supernova energy that heats the gas and drives the outflow .",
    "numerical simulations by @xcite showed that the value of @xmath100 is typically @xmath2@xmath26 , but may be as high as @xmath2@xmath101 .",
    "the presence of an sn ia driven outflow in ngc4278 implies that the supernova efficiency parameter is @xmath102 , exceeding those predicted by numerical simulations .",

    "the total stellar mass is @xmath2@xmath105 , implying a gas mass fraction of @xmath2@xmath5 .",
    "the extended spatial distribution of the hot ionized gas in ngc4697 is consistent with two physical states",

    "this result can be interpreted in a simple manner in view of the environment of ngc4697 .",
    "indeed , ngc4697 is a member of a small galaxy group with @xmath29 members , hence the gas with @xmath2@xmath67 kev temperature is most likely associated with a larger scale group atmosphere .",
    "thus , within the central @xmath2@xmath7 radius , the @xmath2@xmath107 kev galaxy gas dominates the diffuse emission , and at larger radii the hotter group gas becomes predominant .",
    "we derive the x - ray gas mass by employing the same spectral extraction regions , and assuming a spherically symmetric gas distribution . from the emission measure of the thermal component , we derive the confined gas mass in each shell .",
    "the resulting cumulative mass profile is depicted in the right panel of figure [ fig : massprofile ] , which shows that within @xmath7 ( @xmath2@xmath8 kpc ) , ngc4697 contains @xmath2@xmath108 of gas .",
    "we note that this region comprises @xmath2@xmath109 of the total stellar light of the galaxy . the total stellar mass within @xmath7 is @xmath110 , hence the x - ray gas mass fraction is @xmath2@xmath10 , which significantly exceeds that of ngc4278 ( @xmath2@xmath5 ; section [ sec : outflow_ngc4278 ] ) and is consistent with values obtained for more x - ray luminous galaxies ( @xmath2@xmath111 ; @xcite ) , whose x - ray gas content is in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "this suggests that the x - ray gas content of ngc4697 is in hydrostatic equilibrium rather than in an outflow state .",
    "to further study the physical state of the gas , we derive the timescale on which the observed gas can be replenished by the stellar yields of evolved stars .",
    "since the galaxy gas dominates the x - ray emission within @xmath2@xmath7 radius , the calculations presented below refer to this region .",
    "using the average stellar yields for elliptical galaxies @xcite , we estimate an average mass loss rate of @xmath112 .",
    "hence , evolved stars can replenish the observed @xmath2@xmath108 x - ray gas mass on a timescale of @xmath2@xmath31 gyr .",
    "this timescale exceeds the cooling time , which is @xmath113 gyr within the central @xmath2@xmath7 region .",
    "thus , most , if not all , hot gas has been retained in hydrostatic equilibrium in the past @xmath2@xmath31 gyr , implying the absence of galactic - scale outflows .    alternatively , it is also feasible that only a fraction of the x - ray gas leaves the galaxy in a subsonic outflow driven by the energy input of sne ia @xcite .",
    "we derive the available energy input from sne ia , using the average sn ia frequency in e / s0 galaxies @xcite and the k - band luminosity of ngc4697 .",
    "we obtain an sn ia rate of @xmath114 . assuming that the average energy output from sne ia is @xmath81 , sne ia can add at most @xmath115 . to estimate the required power to drive the outflow , we use the velocity dispersion of ngc4697 ( @xmath116  @xcite ; hyperleda ) , the stellar mass - loss rate ( @xmath117 ) , and equation ( 2 ) .",
    "we thus obtain @xmath118 .",
    "if the gas is heated to the virial temperature of @xmath119 kev , then sne ia need to heat the gas an additional @xmath2@xmath120 kev per particle , which in total corresponds to @xmath2@xmath121 .",
    "hence , the total required power to heat the gas and drive an outflow is @xmath2@xmath122 , which is @xmath2@xmath101 of that available from sne ia .",
    "although sne ia are energetically capable of driving an outflow , the above - discussed characteristics of the gas indicate the absence of a global galactic - scale outflow .",
    "a likely explanation of the absence of an outflow and the large gas mass may be that ngc4697 is located in a galaxy group .",
    "indeed , the temperature profile of the hot x - ray gas demonstrated the presence of a hotter component beyond the @xmath2@xmath7 radius , which presumably is associated with the group emission .",
    "the hot x - ray gas inside and outside the optical extent is in pressure equilibrium , thereby suggesting that it is in hydrostatic equilibrium and not in an outflow state .",
    "this result is in good agreement with those obtained by @xcite , who also concluded that the ambient pressure in a dense environment may be able to suppress the evolution of an outflow .",
    "although no hot gas is detected from ngc821 and ngc3379 , this does not imply the absence of x - ray gas and galactic - scale outflows .",
    "as discussed above , evolved stars eject stellar yields at a constant rate , which is proportional with the k - band luminosity ( or stellar mass ) of the galaxy .",
    "based on the k - band luminosity of ngc821 and ngc3379 and using @xcite , we estimate mass input rates of @xmath123 and @xmath124 , respectively . hence , on a timescale of @xmath125 gyr , which is comparable with the stellar age of these galaxies @xcite , the accumulated gas mass should be on the order of @xmath2@xmath126 .",
    "such large gas masses would imply a gas mass fraction of @xmath2@xmath111 , similar to those observed in massive , x - ray luminous early - type galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , such a large gas mass is not observed in ngc821 and ngc3379 , implying that the x - ray gas is driven from the galaxies .",
    "a plausible way to remove the x - ray gas from the potential well of the sample galaxies is via galactic - scale outflows . to derive whether sne ia are energetically capable of driving an outflow , we compute the available energy input from sne ia . given the k - band luminosities of ngc821 and ngc3379 ( table [ tab : list1 ] ) and the average sn ia frequencies @xcite",
    ", we obtain sn ia rates of @xmath127 and @xmath128 , respectively . assuming that each sn ia contributes with @xmath129 erg",
    ", we derive that at most @xmath130 and @xmath131 is available in ngc821 and ngc3379 , respectively .",
    "we confront this value with that required to drive the outflow .",
    "therefore , we use equation ( 2 ) , the stellar mass input rates , and the velocity dispersions of ngc821 and ngc3379 , which are @xmath132 and @xmath133 , respectively . hence , to drive an outflow from ngc821 and ngc3379 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 are required .",
    "thus , the required power is @xmath136 of that available from sne ia , implying that sne ia are capable of driving galactic - scale outflows in both galaxies .    the non - detection of x - ray gas in ngc821 and ngc3379 ,",
    "may be explained by the low gas densities . since the emission measure is proportional to the density square of the gas , the density plays a crucial role in determining the observed x - ray luminosity of the gas .",
    "for example , if the gas density in ngc4278 was a factor of three lower , then the x - ray luminosity would decrease by factor of nine .",
    "however , such a low luminosity gaseous emission could not be detected , therefore ngc4278 would appear as a gas - free galaxy . following this line of argument",
    ", it is likely that both ngc821 and ngc3379 host a small amount of outflowing x - ray gas , which remains unidentified due to its relatively low density and hence low x - ray luminosity .",
    "these considerations are in good agreement with the hydrodynamical simulations of @xcite , who showed that the luminosity of an outflow from ngc821 may fall below the detection limit .",
    "although the radial profiles , the x - ray spectra , and the @xmath16 ratios argue for the non - detection of hot x - ray gas in ngc821 and ngc3379 , we place upper limits on the gas content of these galaxies .",
    "since the @xmath16 ratios of ngc821 and ngc3379 are in fairly good agreement with that obtained for the truly gas - free compact elliptical galaxy , m32 , we estimate that the hot x - ray gas is unlikely to be responsible for more than @xmath137 of the observed thermal component in ngc821 and ngc3379 . to this end",
    ", we extract the x - ray energy spectra of ngc821 and ngc3379 for their @xmath15 ellipses , and describe it with a two component model , consisting of a thermal plasma emission model ( apec ) and a power law component . to fit the spectra , we assumed a @xmath103 solar abundance and galactic column density for both galaxies .",
    "the best - fit temperatures of the thermal models are @xmath138 kev for ngc821 and @xmath139 kev for ngc3379 . assuming that @xmath137 of the thermal emission originates from hot ionized gas and assuming uniform gas density , the upper limits on the confined gas masses are @xmath2@xmath140 for ngc821 and @xmath2@xmath141 for ngc3379 .",
    "sne ia do not only deposit energy into the x - ray emitting gas , but also enrich it with iron - peak elements . on average , each sn ia produces @xmath142 iron , thereby enriching the interstellar medium .",
    "although the abundance of the stellar ejecta is likely to be sub - solar in low - mass ellipticals @xcite , if the stellar yields undergo complete mixing with the iron - peak elements , then the abundances of the hot gas are not expected to agree with the stellar yields , but should be highly super - solar @xcite .",
    "however , the measured abundances are @xmath34 in ngc4278 and @xmath36 in ngc4697 ( section [ sec : spectra ] ) . that is , both galaxies exhibit strongly sub - solar abundances , in conflict with the theoretical expectations .",
    "the observed low abundances may partly be caused by the modest energy resolution of _ chandra _ ccds and the relatively low number of detected photons , which may result in large systematic uncertainties in the abundance determination . in principle , the problem of inaccurate spectral modeling can be circumvented with the application of grating spectroscopy . although distant galaxies with very low x - ray gas content are not suitable for such an investigation due to the low number of photons , studies of nearby and/or gas - rich galaxies found that abundances observed from ccd spectra are in fairly good agreement with those observed by grating spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "therefore , it seems unlikely that the approximately order - of - magnitude difference between observed and expected abundances originates from systematic uncertainties .",
    "the predicted super - solar abundances invoke the complete mixing of iron with the stellar yields .",
    "however , numerical simulations point out that in the case of an outflow , the iron is not well mixed with the ambient gas , resulting in sub - solar abundances @xcite . therefore",
    ", the low abundances observed in ngc4278 ( and possibly in ngc4697 ) may imply that the observed sub - solar abundances are ( at least partly ) due to the incomplete mixing of stellar yields and iron from sne ia .",
    "in general , the low abundance in low - mass ellipticals may be due to the shallow gravitational potential well of these galaxies . at early epochs of galaxy formation ,",
    "core collapse supernovae produce @xmath143-elements . due to supernova driven winds , a large fraction of these elements could be removed from galaxies with shallow potential wells , but are retained in galaxies with more extended halos @xcite . at later epochs ,",
    "sne ia contribute with iron peak elements , thereby enriching the interstellar medium .",
    "in general , low - mass ellipticals are more sensitive to agns and sne ia driven outflows at all times , which may have a major influence on their metal enrichment histories .",
    "it is also possible that the observed low abundances are in part caused by the iron bias , which appears if a multi - temperature plasma or a temperature gradient is described with a single - temperature model @xcite . to illustrate the importance of the iron bias",
    ", we produced a set of two - temperature thermal emission model ( apec ) spectra for ngc4697 , which we fit with a single - temperature model .",
    "the temperatures of the model spectra were @xmath144 kev and @xmath145 kev , whereas the applied set of abundances varied from @xmath146 to @xmath125 solar @xcite .",
    "the normalizations of the two thermal components were set , and the column density was fixed at the galactic value . when describing the two - temperature model with a single temperature spectrum , the best - fit temperature  independent of the abundance ",
    "is @xmath147 kev .",
    "however , the best - fit abundance is significantly lower than the originally assumed value , and it is in all cases subsolar . in particular ,",
    "if the original abundances are set to 5/1/0.5 solar , then the best - fit values are @xmath480.55/0.35/0.25 solar .",
    "although all these values exceed that obtained for ngc4697 , this examination illustrates that describing a multi - temperature plasma with an overly simplistic spectral model may have major effects on the observed abundances .",
    "we stress that this conclusion does not only refer to ngc4697 but is representative for other galaxies with similar parameters as well .",
    "finally , we also mention the existence of a strong degeneracy between the emission measure and the abundance of the hot gas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this degeneracy may have important consequences on the observed parameters of the hot x - ray gas .",
    "if , for example , the abundance of the gas is about solar ( @xmath2@xmath29 times higher than the best - fit values for ngc4278 and ngc4697 ) , then the derived the densities , gas masses , replenishment times , and cooling times must be reduced by a factor of @xmath48@xmath148 .",
    "we studied the unresolved x - ray emission , the hot ionized gas content , and the physical state of the hot x - ray gas in four low - mass elliptical galaxies ( ngc821 , ngc3379 , ngc4278 , ngc4697 ) based on archival _ chandra _ observations .",
    "our results can be summarized as follows .",
    "we find that the bulk of the unresolved emission in ngc821 and ngc3379 originates from a large number of faint compact and stellar objects , such as cvs and abs . despite the non - detection of hot gas , low density , and",
    "hence low luminosity x - ray gas components may be present , which , driven by the energy input of sne ia , outflow from the galaxies at a steady rate .    \\2 .",
    "we detect hot x - ray gas with a temperature of @xmath0 kev in the central @xmath2@xmath1 ( @xmath2@xmath3 kpc ) region of ngc4278 .",
    "the total gas mass within this region is @xmath2@xmath149 , hence the corresponding gas mass fraction of @xmath2@xmath5 .",
    "the x - ray gas exhibits a bipolar morphology in the northeast - southwest direction , suggesting that it is outflowing from the galaxy .",
    "we conclude that the outflowing mass can be replenished by the stellar yields of evolved stars and the outflow can be driven by the energy input of sne ia . based on the existence of an outflow in ngc4278 and the energy budget of the galaxy ,",
    "we place a lower limit of @xmath2@xmath91 on the supernova efficiency parameter .",
    "we show that ngc4697 hosts x - ray gas at all radii , whose temperature within a region with a @xmath2@xmath7 radius is @xmath6 kev , beyond which radius the gas temperature increases to @xmath2@xmath67 kev .",
    "we identify the hotter gas with the group atmosphere surrounding ngc4697 .",
    "although the x - ray gas has a significantly broader distribution than the stellar light , it does not show any asymmetries .",
    "the gas mass within the central @xmath2@xmath7 region is @xmath2@xmath150 , implying a gas mass fraction of @xmath2@xmath10 , which is comparable with those observed in luminous massive early - type galaxies . taken together , this evidence indicates that the x - ray gas is most likely in hydrostatic equilibrium , however a subsonic outflow can not be excluded .",
