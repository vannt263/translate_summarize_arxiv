    "the synthesis of superheavy chemical elements  @xcite in the laboratory is one of the biggest challenges in nuclear physics .",
    "it is an attempt for clarifying the existence limits of all the chemical elements , as well as the completion attempt of the periodic table of chemical elements .",
    "we are concerned with heavy - ion collisions @xmath2 with different impact parameters in this paper .",
    "let @xmath3 and @xmath4 be the mass number and the proton number , respectively . the neutron number @xmath5 is defined by @xmath6 , so that @xmath7 of @xmath0 cm and @xmath1ca are 1.58 and 1.40 , respectively .",
    "if fusion appears , @xmath8 (= @xmath9 ) with @xmath10 is produced .",
    "fast charge equilibration  @xcite is expected to appear in low - energy heavy - ion reactions with an incident energy of a few mev per nucleon .",
    "it provides a very strict limitation for the synthesis of superheavy elements . actually , the @xmath7 of final product is not above nor below the @xmath7 of the projectile and the target ( 1.40 @xmath11 n / z @xmath11 1.58 in this case ) in the case of charge equilibration , so that the proton - richness of the final product follows .",
    "although the actual value of @xmath7 depends on the two colliding ions , its value for the merged nucleus tends to be rather proton - rich for a given proton number of the merged system .",
    "this feature is qualitatively understood by the discrepancy between the @xmath12-stability line and the @xmath13-line for heavier cases .",
    "superheavy compound nuclei are very fragile and fission is a very frequent channel which leads to disintegration of the compound nuclei even at low excitation energies . in this paper ,",
    "following the evaporation prescription shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , a possible fission dynamics of compound nuclei is simulated based on the time - dependent density functional theory ( tddft ) .",
    "self - consistent time - dependent density functional calculations are employed in this paper .",
    "tddft reproduces the quantum transportation due to the collective dynamics . in this sense , what is calculated by the tddft can be regarded as products after several @xmath14  s , which corresponds to a typical time - scale of low - energy heavy - ion reactions ( 1000  fm / c ) , as well as to the inclusive time interval of any collective oscillations such as giant dipole resonance , giant quadrupole resonance and so on .",
    "meanwhile , thermal properties such as the thermal instability are not directly taken into account in tddft . indeed , the skyrme type interaction used in tddft ( for example , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) is determined only from several densities .",
    "it is important that the most effective cooling effect arises from the emission of particles , and therefore it is expected that the break - up or fission of fragments including rather high internal excitation energy is suppressed in the tddft final products .",
    "the additional thermal effects leading to the break - ups of fragments should be introduced .",
    "here is a fact that simplifies the treatment of thermal effects , that is , the difference of the time - scales .",
    "different from the typical time scale of low - energy heavy - ion reactions , the typical time - scale of the thermal effects is estimated by the typical time interval of collision - fission ( fission appearing in heavy - ion collisions ) : several 10@xmath15  s. it is reasonable to introduce an evaporation prescription simply to the tddft final products . in this context",
    "the tddft final fragments have the meaning of products just after the early stage of heavy - ion reactions ( several @xmath14  s ) .",
    "( colour online ) diagram of different reaction channels obtained in @xmath16 collisions by tddft calculations .",
    "the preferred reaction channels for different beam energies and impact paramters are given .",
    "the beam energies are all located above the coulomb barrier which is 209.0  mev .",
    "the results show fusion , deep - inelastic and elastic events .",
    "the difference between fusion - fission and quasi - fission is defined in this paper by whether the fission products satisfy `` 1.40 @xmath11 n / z @xmath11 1.58 '' or not.,width=377 ]    in complete fusion reactions the cross - section for the formation of a certain evaporation residue is usually given by three factors @xcite : @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 mean the capture cross - section , the probability for the compound nucleus formation , and the probability for survival of the compound nucleus against fission .",
    "all three factors are functions of the centre - of - mass energy @xmath21 and the total angular momentum @xmath22 , where @xmath22 can be related with the impact parameter . for light systems @xmath19 and @xmath23",
    "are about unity and @xmath24 .",
    "but in superheavy systems the strong coulomb repulsion and large angular momenta lead to small values of @xmath19 and @xmath23 and therefore to the small cross - sections of the evaporation residues observed in the experiments .",
    "this means , different from light systems , it is necessary to introduce additional thermal effects for the superheavy element synthesis .",
    "first , @xmath18 is sufficiently considered in the tddft if we restrict ourselves to a sufficiently high energy exceeding the coulomb barrier ( cf .",
    "sub - barrier effects such as tunnelling are not taken into account in the tddft ) .",
    "second , @xmath19 is fully considered in the tddft , which is a kind of mass equilibration also related to charge equilibration .",
    "third , @xmath23 whose relative time - scale is by no means equal to the former two probabilities is not satisfactorily considered in the tddft .",
    "this probability is much more related to thermal effects .",
    "consequently , further consideration is necessary only for @xmath23 as far as the energy above the coulomb barrier is concerned .",
    "several factors are included in @xmath23 such as probabilities for fission of the compound nucleus , neutron - evaporation , proton - evaporation , deuteron - evaporation , alpha - particle - evaporation and so on .",
    "probabilities of neutron and @xmath25-particle emissions are considered by @xmath26 for the details of evaporation prescription , see our preceding research summarized in ref .",

    "a procedure of obtaining fission dynamics of excited compound nuclei has been presented , where the reproduction of microscopic fission dynamics was a long standing problem in nuclear theory ( among a few preceding works on microscopic fission dynamics , see j. w. negele  @xcite ) .",
    "the presented method allows us to have a self - consistent treatment of fission dynamics .",
    "the obtained dynamics treating the excited states under the strict total energy conservation is diabatic , which is essentially different from the adiabatic fission dynamics .    for the proposed method it is remarkable that the initial condition of fission dynamics is uniquely determined without having any intentional settings ; i.e.",
    ", it is automatically determined for a given set of @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath40 . as is seen in the comparison between figs .",
    "[ fig5a ] and [ fig6a ] , the presented fission dynamics is hidden if only pure tddft calculations are utilized . in this sense a new point of this method is to choose an ideal configuration ( which is rarely realized in most cases if the excitation energy is not so high ) as the initial state . as a matter of cause , a different choice of @xmath47 and @xmath48 brings about different fission dynamics even from an identical compound nucleus .",
    "it is also worth noting that this method with taking into account many different initial conditions can be utilized to distinguish whether fission arising from the collective dynamics can appear or not . even though the proposed procedure might not be the ultimate solution for investigating fission dynamics , the obtained dynamics actually extracts important aspects of fission dynamics ( for example , see the time evolution of the neck ) .",
