    "nowadays it is widely accepted that quantum entanglement is an essential ingredient for the implementation of quantum information processing devices @xcite .",
    "it is notable that until recently quantum information science was restricted over discrete , finite dimensional hilbert space elements , however , interest on continuous variables has been developing in various contexts : from teleportation @xcite , cryptography @xcite to cloning @xcite . this is closely connected to the recent advances of enhancing nonlinear coupling via electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) mechanism @xcite using a bose - einstein condensate , which has opened possibilities of strong non - linear interaction of ultra slow light pulses @xcite of tiny energies belonging to different modes of electromagnetic fields @xcite .",
    "such advances ranges from building a quantum logic gates based on photonic qubits without resorting to photonic crystals @xcite , entangling continuous variable states @xcite , and preparing entangled states of radiation from mixed thermal states @xcite in conventional media .",
    "facing these recent developments , it is important to understand the entanglement properties of kerr - type interaction particularly for gaussian states , which are one of the states that can be generated by simple experimental devices like beam splitters and phase shifters .    in the present work ,",
    "we have studied the entanglement properties of a model describing a bipartite system of two degrees of freedom , an integrable version of two quartic oscillators @xcite , coupled via a kerr - type interaction .",
    "one could think of some coupled cavities scheme with a kerr medium @xcite as a possible realization of these type of interactions .",
    "the nonlinearity of each of the subsystem oscillator keep some of the properties present in one degree of freedom such as collapses and revivals of the quadrature mean values of each field .",
    "also , this soluble model in which the nonlinearity is present can be used to understand the role of kerr - type nonlinearity on the entanglement dynamics of initially coherent gaussian states .",
    "another case we have considered is the non - classical number states @xcite for the initial disentangled state , which does not entangle via kerr - type coupling , but via usual bilinear coupling in a rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) , and show several differences in the entanglement dynamics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii the model is introduced and the exact solutions for initially disentangled states , in the cases of number states and coherent states , are presented .",
    "analytical expressions for the subsystem density operators and some mean values are calculated .",
    "section iii is reserved to present the exact subsystem linear entropies for both initial states , analyze the conditions for re - coherences and recurrences and discuss the differences in the entanglement dynamics in the proposed cases .",
    "also , we examine the differences of the short time dynamics where no interference phenomenon is possible and the longer time dynamics where such effects do affect the evolution of the subsystems .",
    "another issue treated here is the limit where planck s constant becomes much smaller than the typical action in phase space .",
    "as we shall see , the two cases present distinct semi - classical behaviors . finally in section",
    "iv we present our conclusions .",
    "our theoretical model will be inspired on two field modes in a cavity with a low - loss kerr media , described by the creation and annihilation operators @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) , such that each mode has the usual non - linear interaction term of the form @xmath4 @xcite . besides this non - linear self - interaction term we add two coupling interaction between the field modes : one is the usual rwa coupling @xcite and the other is the kerr - type non - linear interaction @xcite , @xmath5 + \\hbar\\lambda \\left(\\hat{a}_1^{\\dag}\\hat{a}_2+\\hat{a}_1\\hat{a}_2^{\\dag}\\right ) \\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\hbar^2 g \\left(\\hat{a}_1^{\\dagger 2}{\\hat{a}_1}^2 +                     \\hat{a}_2^{\\dagger 2}{\\hat{a}_2}^2 \\right)+   \\hbar^2 g^{'}\\hat{a}_1^{\\dagger}\\hat{a}_1\\hat{a}^{\\dagger}_2\\hat{a}_2 . \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the constants @xmath6 and @xmath7 @xcite depend upon the third - order non - linear susceptibility @xmath8 and no losses will be considered . since our purpose here is to have an exactly soluble model with the nonlinearities in such a way that we could trace out the effect of each interaction term on the entanglement dynamics , we will just set @xmath9 and also choose the resonant case ( @xmath10 ) such that the hamiltonian can be re - written in the following form : @xmath11 + \\hbar\\lambda \\left(\\hat{a}_1^{\\dag}\\hat{a}_2+\\hat{a}_1\\hat{a}_2^{\\dag}\\right ) \\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\hbar^2 g \\left(\\hat{a}_1^{\\dagger}{\\hat{a}_1}+                     \\hat{a}_2^{\\dagger}{\\hat{a}_2 } + 1 \\right)^2\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\hat{h}_0+\\hat{v_{\\lambda}}+\\hat{v_{g}}. \\label{eq : hamiltonian}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] notice that the entire kerr type interaction is now in the form of the square of the free hamiltonian @xmath12 , and hence the following commutation relations hold + @xmath13=\\left[\\hat{v}_g,\\hat{v_{\\lambda } } \\right]=0 .",
    "\\label{eq : commutator}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this property is important for two reasons : first , it is associated to the presence of a constant of motion ( @xmath14 ) ; and second , it allows us to study separately the action of each interaction term in the evolution operator on the initial state , and hence its consequences on the entanglement process . in what follows ,",
    "we study the cases of initially uncorrelated number and coherent states .      for the case of initially disentangled number states of the harmonic oscillators",
    ": @xmath15 we can write @xmath16 in eq.([eq : hamiltonian ] ) in terms of two new quartic oscillators diagonalizing the rwa - coupling , using the transformation proposed by zoubi _",
    "@xcite , @xmath17 the resulting hamiltonian can be written in terms of the number operators @xmath18 , of the _ new _ oscillators as follows : @xmath19 using eq.([eq : trans ] ) , we can connect the two different basis of the two oscillators hilbert space by the relation    @xmath20    where @xmath21!(i+j)!}{2^{\\mathcal{n}}n_1!n_2!}},\\nonumber\\\\ \\mathcal{n}&= & \\left < n_1,n_2|\\hat{\\mathcal{n}}|n_1,n_2\\right>=n_1+n_2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the sub - index ` @xmath22 ' or ` @xmath23 ' indicates the bosonic representation the ket belongs to .",
    "it is to be noticed that at the right hand side of eq.([eq : basis ] ) , only those states with the total number @xmath24 fixed by the initial state are present . using the hamiltonian in the diagonal form , eq.([eq : hnum ] ) , and eq.([eq : basis ] )",
    "the time - evolved state can be written as @xmath25 where the quantity @xmath26 is a global phase .",
    "this phase factor will be relevant in section  [ sec : solcoe ] , where this result will be used to construct the solution for the case of coherent states .",
    "hence , for the number states , eq.([eq : psit1 ] ) shows that the dynamics of the stationary states are completely determined by the rwa coupling and the effect of non - linear part of the hamiltonian is only in the global phase .",
    "+ after a little algebra we can re - write the above state eq.([eq : psit1 ] ) in a more instructive form : @xmath27 the sub - indexes `` 12''(``21 '' ) of the operators @xmath28 emphasize the entanglement features of the dynamics . here , we omitted the remaining global phase , and used the fact that the vacuum state in both representations spaces must be the same .",
    "+ now , we can extract some informations of entanglement process of number states under the action solely of the rwa interaction . at times",
    "@xmath29 , with @xmath30 integer , eq.([eq : numb ] ) gives @xmath31 indicating that the system is in a disentangled state , but not the same as the initial one .",
    "however , at times @xmath32 we recover the exact initial state ( modulo an overall phase ) : @xmath33 hence , for the case of initially disentangled number states , we have found two characteristic times : ( a ) the _ re - coherence times _",
    "@xmath34 , for the which the subsystems recover the purity of the initial state , and ( b ) the _ recurrence times _",
    "@xmath35 , when the evolved state becomes equal to the initial state .",
    "this allows us to classify @xmath36 in eq.([eq : ininumber ] ) as a _",
    "reversible state _ for this particular interaction .",
    "consequently , we may define a _ period of reversibility _ for such states : @xmath37 .",
    "for the special case of _ equal _ initial number states ( @xmath38 ) , the difference between the re - coherence and recurrence times disappears and the reversibility occurs earlier , as can be seen in eq.([eq : enumtpi2 ] ) .",
    "consider an initially disentangled product of two coherent states as follows : @xmath39 the time - evolved state can be obtained using the previous result eq.([eq : numb ] ) , including the @xmath24-dependent phase @xmath40 @xmath41 where @xmath42 . in this result",
    "we have already omitted a global phase .",
    "it is easy to see that for @xmath43 the rwa - coupling does not entangle the oscillators , since the two summations of eq.([eq : cohst ] ) can be factorized , and each oscillator remains in a coherent form @xmath44|0,0\\rangle\\nonumber\\\\ & = & |\\beta_1(t),\\beta_2(t)\\rangle , \\label{eq : rwa}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 and @xmath46=e^{\\left(\\beta_k \\hat{a}^\\dagger_k - \\beta_k^ * \\hat{a}_k\\right)}$ ] is the displacement operator in the phase space of the @xmath47-th oscillator .    using this particular result",

    "these results for the subsystem variances are very similar to those obtained for the one degree of freedom quartic oscillator @xcite .",
    "the most instructive information is the relation between the collapse and the phase space s _ delocalization in phase _ of the state , as can be seen in the projected _ q_-function that will be illustrated in the next section for a particular set of parameters .",
    "due to the fact that here we have two interacting subsystems , their entanglement prevent the appearance of superpositions of coherent states for each oscillator for low integer fractions of the re - coherence times .",
    "but , in contrast to the case coupled to a reservoir @xcite , we will see in what follows that at the revival time the subsystem entropy goes to zero ( re - coherence ) , and the system do come back to the initial state ( recurrence ) under appropriate conditions .",

    "in this section we are going to discuss the entanglement dynamics of time - evolved states found in section  [ sec : model ] ; namely , the product of number states and coherent states .",
    "we analyze the subsystem entropy , one important tool that gives a measure of entanglement for globally pure bipartite systems , and also the husimi distribution or _",

    "moreover , we would like to find the behavior of the subsystem linear entropies in the _ semi - classical limit_.      we are interested in the calculation of both , the subsystem linear entropy ( sle ) and the von neumann entropy , usually defined by @xmath81 where the label @xmath47 is associated to one of the degrees of freedom . for the initially disentangled number states eq.([eq : ininumber ] ) , the reduced density operator is diagonal in the number state basis ; therefore , it can be directly expressed in terms of its eigenvalues as follows @xmath82 where the trace condition @xmath83 must be satisfied .",

    "we present some simple examples :    * for @xmath88 we have : @xmath89 * for @xmath90 we have : @xmath91 * for @xmath92 we have : @xmath93    these analytical results for the sle are shown in fig.[fig : dn3](a ) .",
    "an interesting fact is the appearance of the oscillatory structures between two successive re - coherences for particular values of @xmath94 .",

    "a simple analysis of eq.([eq : rle ] ) shows that this happens in the following situations :    1 .   for any initial conditions excluding the vacuum state ( @xmath107 ) , the re - coherence times associated to the non - linear interaction are @xmath108 , when the argument of the sine - function is an integer multiple of @xmath109 : @xmath110 2 .   for those initial conditions such that one of the arguments @xmath111 , one can find other instants when sle is zero .",
    "these conditions are associated exclusively with rwa coupling and special initial conditions . in terms of the quadratures of the initial values @xmath112 , using the expression ( [ eq : beta ] ) one can write these conditions as follows : + + @xmath113 , + and we have disentangled states for times @xcite : + + @xmath114 , or @xmath115 .    among these re - coherence times , we can identify those at which we also have recurrences by examining eq.([eq : psit2d ] ) .",

    ", we adopted the convention to fix the value of @xmath130 and vary @xmath98 instead of the opposite way . the first thing to be noticed",

    "<S> an exactly soluble non - linear interaction hamiltonian is proposed to study fundamental properties of the entanglement dynamics for a coupled non - linear oscillators . </S>",
    "<S> the time - evolved state is obtained analytically for initial products of two coherent and two number states and relevant informations are extracted from the dynamics of various quantities like subsystem linear and von neumann entropies , quadrature mean values , variances and @xmath0-functions . </S>",
    "<S> we determined the re - coherence time scales and found among the interaction terms present in the hamiltonian the one responsible for the entanglement in both cases . </S>",
    "<S> we identify the existence of two regimens for the entanglement dynamics in the case of initially coherent states : the short time , _ phase spread _ </S>",
    "<S> regimen where the entropy rises monotonically and the _ self - interference _ regimen where the entropy oscillates and re - coherence phenomenon can be observed . </S>",
    "<S> we also found that the _ break time _ from the first regimen to the second one becomes longer , as well as the re - coherence and reversibility times , as the planck s constant becomes much smaller than a typical action in phase space . </S>"
