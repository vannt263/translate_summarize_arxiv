    "there are three historical observational evidences for the big - bang model : the cosmic expansion , the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation and primordial or big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) .",
    "today they are complemented by a large number of evidences in particular from the properties of the large scale structures ( see @xcite for a textbook description ) .",
    "bbn predicts the primordial abundances of the `` light cosmological elements '' : @xmath7he , d , @xmath8he and @xmath9li  that are produced during the first 20 mn after the big - bang when the universe was dense and hot enough for nuclear reactions to take place . comparing the calculated and observed abundances",
    ", there is an overall good agreement except for the , .",
    "the essential cosmological parameter of the model is the baryon to photon ratio , @xmath10 where the photon number density is determined from the cmb temperature and @xmath11 is related the baryonic density .",
    "@xmath0 is now well measured from the angular power spectrum of the cmb temperature anisotropies .",
    "a precise value for this free parameter was provided by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) satellite , @xmath12 ,  @xcite while the recent planck mission updated it to @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "the goal of this letter is to update our previous work  @xcite to incorporate ( @xmath14 ) the planck results , ( @xmath15 ) nuclear network improvements and ( @xmath16 ) new spectroscopic observations . to trace the changes since  @xcite",
    ", we follow , step by step , the effects of each update to identify the key parameters .",
    "we first consider the update of the observational data ( section 2 ) while in sections  3 and  4 , we present the new results with the last nuclear and cmb data and with an extended network respectively .",
    "deuterium is a very fragile isotope , easily destroyed after bbn .",
    "its most primitive abundance is determined from the observation of clouds at high redshift , on the line of sight of distant quasars .",
    "very few such observations are available . for @xmath17",
    ", we previously determined a theoretical bbn deuterium abundance , d / h = @xmath18  @xcite .    from the observation of about 10 quasar absorption systems the weighted mean abundance of deuterium",
    "is d / h = @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "however , the individual measurements of d / h show a considerable scatter and it is likely that systematic errors dominate the uncertainties . most of the measurements available in the literature have been gathered in  @xcite to deduce d / h  @xmath20 .",
    "recently , the observation of a damped lyman-@xmath21 ( dla ) at @xmath22 has permitted  @xcite a new determination of @xmath23 , leading to a mean determination lower than the previous one , @xmath24 .",
    "but , since the hi ly-@xmath21 absorption associated to this system is redshifted exactly on top of the ly-@xmath21-nv blend emission from the quasar , the errors on this measurement are probably underestimated .",
    "a new analysis is needed to clarify this question and we do not take into account this value presently to determine our weighted mean d abundance .",
    "different star formation histories in the galaxies associated with the dlas could explain this dispersion .",
    "for a recent analysis of the deuterium observations , we refer to @xcite and in this present study , we thus adopt their d / h mean abundance value , @xmath25    after bbn , @xmath7he  is still produced by stars , essentially during the main sequence phase .",
    "its primitive abundance is deduced from observations in hii ( ionized hydrogen ) regions of compact blue galaxies . in a hierarchical structure formation model ,",
    "these dwarf galaxies are more primitive than the galaxies .",
    "the primordial @xmath7he  mass fraction , @xmath6 , is obtained from the extrapolation to zero metallicity but is affected by systematic uncertainties @xcite such as plasma temperature or stellar absorption .",
    "these determinations based on almost the same set of observations lead to @xmath26    recently , @xcite have determined the primordial helium abundance using a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) techniques . in this study ,",
    "a regression to zero metallicity yields @xmath27    which corresponds to a narrower error bar than previously .",
    "we take this last value for comparison with our calculation .",
    "contrary to @xmath7he  , @xmath8he  is both produced and destroyed in stars all along its galactic evolution , so that the evolution of its abundance as a function of time is subject to large uncertainties .",
    "moreover , @xmath8he  has been observed in our galaxy @xcite , and gives only a local constraint @xmath28 consequently , the baryometric status of @xmath8he  is not firmly established @xcite .",
    "primitive lithium abundance is deduced from observations of low metallicity stars in the halo of our galaxy where the lithium abundance is almost independent of metallicity , displaying the so - called spite plateau @xcite .",
    "this interpretation assumes that lithium has not been depleted at the surface of these stars , so that the presently observed abundance can be assumed to be equal to the initial one .",
    "the small scatter of values around the spite plateau is indeed an indication that depletion may not have been very effective .",
    "however , there is a discrepancy between the value i ) deduced from these observed spectroscopic abundances and ii ) the one calculated by bbn from @xmath29cmb observations .",
    "many studies have been devoted to the resolution of this so - called _ lithium problem _ and many possible `` solutions '' , none fully satisfactory , have been proposed . for a detailed analysis see @xcite and the proceedings of the meeting `` lithium in the cosmos ''  @xcite .",
    "astronomical observations of these metal poor halo stars @xcite have thus led to a relative primordial abundance of @xmath30 while more recent analysis  @xcite gives @xmath31 which we use in our analysis . for reviews on the li observations ,",
    "we refer to  @xcite and @xcite .",
    "since our previous monte - carlo bbn calculations @xcite , no change has been made concerning 11 of the 12 main bbn reactions rates .",
    "we thus use those from the the evaluation performed by @xcite except for @xmath32h(n,@xmath33)d @xcite and @xmath8he(@xmath34be @xcite .",
    "the only modification of one of the main rates concerns the weak reactions involved in n@xmath35p equilibrium whose rates @xcite is determined from the standard theory of the weak interaction but needs to be normalized to the experimental neutron lifetime .",
    "the latter has recently been revised from 885.7@xmath10.8  s  @xcite , used in @xcite , to 880.1@xmath11.1  s @xcite .",
    "this significant change is due to the re - consideration of the previously discarded  @xcite experimental value , now comforted by new analyses ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "comparison between columns 3 and 4 in table  [ t : yields ] shows the effect of this change , which remains very small since it lowers @xmath6 by 0.44% and , /h by 0.39% , letting the other abundances unchanged .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      +",
