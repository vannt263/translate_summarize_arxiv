    "the total mass of the milky way ( mw ) is a key astrophysical quantity for placing our galaxy in a cosmological context , modeling the formation of the local group , deciphering the structure and dynamics of the luminous galactic components , and ultimately for understanding the complex processes of baryon dissipation and substructure survival within the cold dark matter ( cdm ) hierarchy .",
    "it is , unfortunately , amongst the most poorly known of all galactic parameters . a common technique to measure the total mass of the mw is to use kinematic tracers such as globular clusters , distant halo stars and satellite galaxies @xcite . in spherical geometry , the jeans equation provides a link between the host potential of a pressure - supported system and the distribution function of the tracer population in equilibrium with it according to @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the total gravitating mass , @xmath6 is the density profile of the tracer stars , @xmath7 is their radial velocity dispersion , and @xmath8 is the velocity anisotropy between the tangential , @xmath9 , and radial components of the dispersion . even with high - quality data ( accurate distances and radial velocities ) , the orbital eccentricities and the density profile of the tracer population are poorly constrained . without firm knowledge of the tracer properties ,",
    "galactic mass measurements suffer from the well - known mass - anisotropy - density degeneracy .",
    "the unknown properties and low number of tracers , the uncertainties as to whether some satellites are bound or unbound , and the problematic extrapolations from the inner halo to the virial radius , are all reflected in the wide range of estimates for the virial mass of the mw , @xmath10 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "note that commonly used mass estimators implicitly assume that kinematic tracers are relaxed .",
    "in fact , the much longer dynamical timescales at large radii suggest that the outer reaches of the stellar halo are dominated by unrelaxed substructure .    in this letter , we take a different approach to `` weighing '' the mw halo , one that combines the latest samples of halo stars selected from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) with measured radial velocities to state - of - the - art numerical simulations of realistic mw analogs .",
    "the fully cosmological simulations employed in the present study include eris , one of the highest - resolution hydrodynamical simulations ever run of the formation of a @xmath0 mw - sized disk galaxy @xcite , as well as the more massive , @xmath1 , dark - matter only via lactea ii ( vlii ) simulation @xcite .",
    "eris is the first simulated galaxy in a @xmath11cdm cosmology in which the galaxy structural properties , mass budget in the various components , and scaling relations between mass and luminosity all appear to be consistent with a host of mw observational constraints .",
    "it thus provides an excellent laboratory for creating mock sdss samples of tracer halo stars and compare their density , velocity anisotropy , and radial velocity dispersion profiles with the data",
    ". we will show below that eris stellar halo reproduces the kinematic properties of sdss halo stars remarkably well , and argue that this offers added evidence for a `` light , '' centrally concentrated mw dark matter halo .",
    "to derive precision constraints on the mass of the mw s dark matter halo , we use the samples of blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) stars specifically targeted by the sdss and segue for spectroscopy .",
    "bhb stars are excellent tracers of galactic halo dynamics because they are luminous and have a nearly constant absolute magnitude within a restricted color range .",
    "the @xcite sample of bhb stars includes 2,558 stars with galactocentric distances @xmath12 kpc .",
    "their selection combines a photometric color cut based on the analysis by @xcite and two spectroscopic balmer line cuts meant to remove contaminating blue straggler ( bs ) and warm main - sequence stars . with the aim of finding more distant , @xmath13 kpc stars",
    ", @xcite first implemented a photometric color cut to select objects with @xmath14 consistent with faint stars .",
    "follow - up spectroscopy with the vlt - fors2 revealed 7 bhb and 31 bs stars reaching galactocentric distances of 150 kpc .",
    "these were complemented with a sample of n - type carbon ( cn ) stars @xcite , and two additional bhb stars @xcite .",
    "the final distant halo star sample comprises 144 bhb and bs stars between 50 and 90 kpc and 17 bhb and cn stars between 80 and 160 kpc .",
    "we adopt the binning of all these data exactly as published in figure 9 of @xcite : the radial bins contain as many as 1239 ( inner black point ) and as few as 9 ( outer blue point ) stars .",

    "eris follows the formation of a @xmath0 galaxy halo from @xmath15 to the present epoch using the @xmath16-body + smoothed particles hydrodynamics code gasoline @xcite .",
    "the target halo was selected to have a quiet merger history , and the high resolution region was resampled with 13 million dark matter particles and an equal number of gas particles , for a mass resolution of @xmath17 and @xmath18 , and a gravitational softening of 120 pc ( physical ) .",

    "@xcite first noted this decline in the radial velocity dispersion using bhb and red giant stars as well as distant satellite galaxies and globular clusters .",
    "the presence in eris of such a cold radial velocity dispersion is not caused by the dominance of tangential motions , as stellar orbits are nearly radial beyond 100 kpc .",

    "the heatmaps in figure [ figeheat ] all reveal complex , structured behavior beyond 60 kpc , as expected from a hierarchically - formed stellar halo . while a detailed study of the evolution of substructure in phase - space is beyond the scope of this paper , here we show , in figure [ figphase ] , a two - dimensional radial velocity @xmath52 versus @xmath53 slice of all stellar tracers in eris ( excluding those still bound to satellites ) .",

    "the kinematic properties of halo stars in the eris simulation , supported by a relatively low - mass , highly concentrated dark matter halo , are in remarkably good agreement with the sdss data . in particular",
    ", we find that the `` cold veil '' observed in the distant stellar halo of the mw by @xcite , with tracers as cold as @xmath2 between 100 - 150 kpc , is also seen in most mock sdss realizations in eris . this feature is caused by the cold , unrelaxed regime of the stellar halo , where its radial extent approaches the virial radius of the galaxy . using controlled experiments based on the integration of the spherical jeans equation as well as a particle tagging technique applied to vlii , we find that a  heavy \" mw host produces a poor fit to the kinematic sdss data , unless the tracer density profile is very steep and/or the orbits of halo stars are tangentially biased .",
    "it is fair at this stage to caution the reader that , since in the outer halo regions of the simulation phase space is not smoothly filled but structured according to a few random accretion events , the nice match between the observational data and the eris simulation beyond 100 kpc may be the lucky outcome of a specific infall history .",
    "still , our analysis shows that it would be much harder to match the observed radial velocity dispersion profile in ( say ) the inner 70 kpc , where stars are more phase - mixed , with a more massive halo like vlii .",
    "more eris - like simulations , together with measurements of the tracer density profile and anisotropy over a large radial extent in the galaxy using deeper photometric data ( e.g. , the kilo degree survey ) and proper motion surveys ( e.g. , from _ gaia _ and the _ hubble space telescope _ ) , should all make a precise determination of the mass of the mw halo achievable in the near future .",
