    "the significance of strong electronic correlations in metals has long been acknowledged when intractable enigmas of solid state physics such as itinerant magnetism , the correlation - induced metal - insulator transition , unconventional superconductivity , or spin liquid states and non - fermi liquid behavior of electronic excitations were embraced .",
    "the scope of the `` strongly correlated physics '' is nowadays enormous ; it extends to the fractional quantum hall effect and high-@xmath0 superconductivity , and also in mesoscopic systems an increasing number of investigations take this route since certain scenarios with strong local interactions can be modeled more directly in experiments on a mesoscopic scale . the efforts to fathom the underlying mechanisms resulted only in partial success .",
    "especially , models with strong local interactions of itinerant electrons resisted a thorough understanding beyond certain limiting , and often unphysical , cases .",
    "the celebrated hubbard model epitomizes the two opposing characters of narrow band electrons : electron hopping ( with energy scale @xmath1 ) supports the itinerant character , suitably expressed in momentum space , and favors a metallic character .",
    "in contrast to this , the local on - site coulomb interaction @xmath2 may drive the electrons , depending on band - filling , into a mott insulating state , with strong magnetic correlations .",
    "standard perturbation theory is not applicable in the transition regime ( for a recent discussion see @xcite ) , and whether it even was valid for any finite @xmath2 in two space dimensions @xcite was a longstanding problem . on the other hand ,",
    "perturbation theory from the atomic limit , with no kinetic terms , is not feasible in a straightforward manner since the tremendous degeneracy for low energy states of the fully localized limit renders the usual perturbation theory inapplicable .",
    "furthermore , a hopping expansion can not build on wick s theorem since the zeroth order hamiltonian is not bilinear in the canonical electron fields , though progress has been achieved recently @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , for @xmath3 a schrieffer - wolff transformation may be performed to the appropriate order in @xmath4 .",
    "this may be visualized as a rotation of the states in hilbert space such that transitions between different subspaces with fixed number of doubly occupied sites are suppressed to the corresponding order in @xmath4 .",
    "equivalently , one usually applies a canonical transformation to the hamilton operator in order to generate an effective hamiltonian of which the low energy part is explicit .",
    "the hubbard model is reduced in this way @xcite to a @xmath1@xmath5 model ( plus pair - hopping ) up to linear order in @xmath4  or to a `` @xmath1-model '' in zeroth order .",
    "the @xmath1-model is just the kinetic term , however it is now a correlated hopping in the sense that double occupancies are excluded .",
    "this constrained hopping can only be envisioned in real space .",
    "the @xmath1@xmath5 model includes , beyond the constrained hopping , a heisenberg spin - exchange and a short range density - density correlation term of scale @xmath6 .",
    "although all these strong coupling models present the local spin and charge excitations in an appealing way , it is still a long way to extract the true ( delocalized ) low - energy excitations .    in the past decades considerable effort",
    "has been invested into the construction of techniques which work in the constrained fock space .",
    "already hubbard introduced projection operators onto local ( site- ) states with no electron ( @xmath7 ) , one electron with spin @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) or double occupancy ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "these so - called hubbard x - operators belong to a graded lie - algebra , and a canonical many - particle green s function formalism is not applicable ( for a detailed review of functional integral representations and a suitable choice of coherent states for x - operators see ref .",
    "the evaluation scheme by hubbard shaped the appropriate picture of lower and upper `` hubbard bands '' for low and high energy ( in- ) coherent excitations , respectively .",
    "yet it suffered from inconsistencies , e.g.  the failure to satisfy the luttinger theorem .",
    "an alternative approach , which also implements a projection onto local states , is the slave boson formalism @xcite .",
    "electron creation and annihilation operators are represented by composite operators whereby an electron is annihilated either by the creation of a hole site , accompanied by the annihilation of a singly occupied site with corresponding spin or the annihilation of a doubly occupied site , accompanied by the creation of a singly occupied site with opposite spin .",
    "several choices exist how to ascribe fermionic and bosonic degrees of freedom to these operators , for a discussion see @xcite .",
    "although the operators are now canonical fermionic and bosonic operators , they live in a constrained fock space since the sum of their respective particle numbers ( the _ pseudo charge _ ) has to be unity for each site .",
    "mean field or saddle point approximations satisfy the constraint only on the average and , furthermore , lead to bose condensation of the slave bosons @xcite .",
    "actually , the saddle point approximation becomes exact in the unphysical limit @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the spin degeneracy .",
    "corrections to the mean field result were calculated in the first order of the expansion parameter @xmath13  the constraint is thereby replaced by a `` soft constraint '' with pseudo charge equal to @xmath14 . for @xmath15 , the bosons condense , that is , they attain a finite complex expectation value , the square of which is the density of empty sites .    in the barnes representation ,",
    "only the charge degree of freedom is represented by the slave boson . in contrast",
    ", both spin and charge degrees of freedom are carried by bosons ( and fermions ) in the kotliar and ruckenstein representation @xcite , while in the spin and charge rotation invariant representation @xcite they are carried by bosons only .",
    "the mean - field approach to the kotliar and ruckenstein representation has been quite successful when compared to numerical simulations .",
    "indeed , the paramagnetic mean - field solution is equivalent to the gutzwiller approximation@xcite .",
    "even though this is the saddle point of an action , it turns out to obey a variational principle in the limit of large spatial dimensions , where the gutzwiller approximation and the gutzwiller wave function are identical @xcite .",
    "when the dimension is reduced , they are not known to differ markedly .",
    "comparison of ground state energies @xcite , and charge structure factors @xcite with quantum monte carlo data show excellent agreement .",
    "a variety of saddle points have been investigated , in particular in the vicinity of the mott transition @xcite .",
    "the mott gap can be calculated as well @xcite , and comparison with experimental data in la@xmath16y@xmath17tio@xmath18 @xcite displays a very good agreement @xcite .",
    "nevertheless the computation of fluctuations , in particular in the magnetic channel , remains problematic .",
    "moreover such a finite expectation value of the complex slave boson field violates elitzur s theorem according to which , in a theory with local gauge invariance , only locally gauge invariant operators may acquire a non - zero expectation value .",
    "correspondingly , for finite @xmath12 , the phase fluctuations of the boson field suppress the condensation .",
    "a zero expectation value of the bosonic field , however , is problematic as a starting point since the bosonic field has to connect to the number of empty sites , in the end .",
    "it was early on recognized that these difficulties are avoided in a polar decomposition where the zero mode of the phase fluctuations may be singled out and the expectation value of the radial amplitude is , in general , non - vanishing @xcite ( a more recent , detailed discussion of @xmath13corrections in the `` radial gauge '' is found in the review by arrigoni _ et al . _",
    "although subtleties are associated with the measure and the correct translation of the time discretized functional integral into the continuum limit version , the result in @xmath13 is not different from that of an x - operator approach @xcite .    despite the progress in the understanding of the fluctuations around the mean field saddle point",
    ", the physically most interesting case with the largest possible spin fluctuations , @xmath19 , remains inaccessible .",
    "moreover , the saddle point solution is generically a fermi liquid solution and , therefore , non - fermi liquid behavior is necessarily non - perturbative in @xmath13 .",
    "this motivated the karlsruhe group @xcite to device a slave - boson formalism which builds on canonical many - particle techniques , is locally gauge - invariant by construction and , most importantly , allows for fermi liquid and non - fermi liquid behavior for the considered ( multi - channel ) anderson impurity problem .",
    "it permits to recover the physical quantities over the complete temperature range , from the high temperature local moment regime to the low temperature correlated many - body state . in spite of this major success of slave boson theory ,",
    "it is still a formidable problem to set up a similar diagrammatic evaluation for strongly correlated itinerant electrons .",
    "it is quite instructive to compare the implementation of the constraint in this diagrammatic formalism with that in the functional integral radial gauge representation . in the first approach",
    ", local gauge invariance is guaranteed through ward identities in a conserving approximation .",
    "this enforces the constraint only in so far as transitions between sectors of the fock space with different pseudo charge are suppressed during the time evolution of a considered many particle state .",
    "the projection onto the physical sector of the fock space is achieved in a last step , when physical expectation values are calculated , using the abrikosov procedure of sending the lagrange multiplier of the constraint to infinity .",
    "this may be contrasted with the functional integral calculation in the radial gauge : here the phase is fixed and the amplitude of the boson will in turn strongly fluctuate",
    ". the pseudo charge conservation will not be satisfied a priori .",
    "this is precisely the reason why one has to project onto the physical subspace at each time step ( and , of course , at each site ) which is accomplished by promoting the lagrange multiplier of the constraint into a field .    in this paper",
    "we reexamine functional integrals for strongly correlated electrons with @xmath19 in the radial gauge .",
    "we restrain our considerations to `` @xmath20 '' , that is the limit of strong local interaction between electrons so that the number of doubly occupied sites is zero .",
    "the hubbard model is reduced to either the @xmath21 or @xmath22 model . in this limit",
    ", the bosonic fields in radial representation reduce to their respective ( real ) amplitude since all time derivatives of the corresponding phases can be absorbed in a ( time - dependent ) lagrange multiplier field .",
    "it is possible to construct the functional integral either as an integration over continuous values of the boson radial amplitudes and the lagrange multiplier , or , equivalently one can implement the constraint first and thereby reduce the integration over the slave boson amplitude to a discrete sum over the values of `` hole occupancy '' , @xmath23 .",
    "the first method is more appropriate for approximation schemes which further manipulate the path integral analytically , and the latter method is to be taken as a starting point for numerical calculations in the strong coupling limit which do not build on a hirsch decoupling @xcite .    in general , there are no ab initio advantages of one functional integral representation over another representation .",
    "it depends on the approximation scheme if a concrete representation is suitable .",
    "for example , when @xmath13fluctuations are considered the radial gauge consistently separates the zero - mode fluctuations .",
    "moreover , for any @xmath12 , the square of the slave boson amplitude is equal to the amplitude itself since the constraint projects the amplitude onto the values @xmath23 . in the radial gauge",
    ", this renders the integrations over the real fields gaussian , albeit the bosons are still coupled to the fermionic grassmann fields .",
    "this projection property also ensures that the measure does not produce the cumbersome logarithmic terms in the action and , more significantly , non - local density - density interactions turn out to be gaussian terms in the functional integral . the latter is not valid in the cartesian gauge .",
    "these observations should suffice as motivation to readdress the construction of the slave boson functional integral in the radial gauge .",
    "in section  [ sec : fi ] we introduce the correct functional integral representation in the radial gauge , in the limit @xmath24 . in section  [ sec : discrete ] we propose an alternative discrete representation which may serve for numerical simulations . in section  [ sec : nonloc ] we extend these representations to lattice models , with ( possibly ) long - ranged density - density interactions . several calculations for simple models are carried out to illustrate this new method .",
    "in any slave boson representation of strongly correlated electron systems there is a gauge symmetry group as a consequence of the redundancy of the representation of the physical electron operator .",
    "the first slave boson representation is due to barnes @xcite .",
    "it was introduced to tackle the single - impurity anderson model .",
    "the local physical electron operator @xmath25 is , in the limit of infinitely strong on - site interaction , rewritten as a product of auxiliary fields @xmath26 and @xmath27 : @xmath28 here @xmath26 is a doublet of canonical fermionic fields , and @xmath27 a canonical bosonic field .",
    "we stay in the physical sector of the fock space provided the auxiliary fields fulfill the constraint relation : @xmath29 in a functional integral representation of the partition sum @xmath30 , the constraint is enforced via the integration over a lagrange multiplier @xmath31 ( for a standard reference see @xcite ) : @xmath32 \\int d[b , b^{\\dagger } ]     e^{-\\int_0^{\\beta } d \\tau",
    "{ \\mathcal{l'}}(\\tau)}\\ ] ] with @xmath33 and @xmath34 the last two contributions to the lagrange density are hopping of electrons ( @xmath35 ) and the non - local part of the electron - electron interaction ( @xmath36 ) , respectively .",
    "the chemical potential , which fixes the average number of electrons , is @xmath37 .",
    "the space dependence ( lattice site index @xmath38 ) of the fields and of @xmath31 is suppressed in eq .",
    "( [ zcan ] ) , for simplicity . since the pseudo charge @xmath39 , defined in eq .",
    "( [ eqcon ] ) , is a conserved quantity , the action is invariant under a group of local @xmath40 gauge transformations @xcite . in the continuum limit , it reads : @xmath41 the physical electron operators are invariant under this transformation .",
    "it is well known that @xmath31 has to be continued into the complex plane , and the integration contour has to be shifted into the lower half - plane in order to ensure convergence of the functional integral @xcite : @xmath42 moreover , the phase of the bosonic field may be gauged away by promoting the constraint into a field .",
    "the remaining degree of freedom of the boson is consequently its amplitude . having gauged away the phase of the slave boson brings us to the _",
    "radial gauge_.    certainly , the expectation value of any physical observable has to be gauge invariant . in the conventional cartesian representation",
    " with the integration over both , the real and imaginary components of the bosonic field  the particle number of bosons ( holes ) is fixed within a gauge - invariant , conserving approximation @xcite . in the radial representation , however , the gauge is usually fixed in order to reduce the bosonic field to a real field , and the number of bosons is fluctuating . only in the final integration over the lagrange multiplier field @xmath43",
    ", the particle number conservation is ensured at each time step .",
    "this situation is somewhat reminiscent of the theoretical modeling of superconductivity where , in bcs theory , the phase of the condensate is fixed , but gauge invariance is restored in rpa @xcite .",
    "nonetheless the situation for superconductivity is distinct because there , a _ global _ gauge is broken , whereas here a broken _ local _ gauge has to be restored .    in a specific gauge",
    ", the correctness of the representation can be verified through the evaluation of the partition sum , and any correlation function , in the atomic limit . in this case",
    "the calculation is straightforward .",
    "for example , the partition sum reads : @xmath44 where @xmath45 ^ 2 $ ] and @xmath46^{-1}$ ] .",
    "note that the projection onto the physical subspace ( @xmath47 ) follows from a contour integral in the complex @xmath48-plane , with @xmath49 , and it only picks up the residue at @xmath50 .",
    "one may try to carry out this program in the polar representation , namely by introducing the amplitude @xmath51 and the phase @xmath52 of the bosonic field : @xmath53 the bosonic part of the partition sum can be calculated @xcite , and the result is again correctly @xmath54 .",
    "nevertheless , in this way one does not promote @xmath31 into a field , and the phases @xmath52 are not gauged away and , more importantly , the action to lowest order in the time step , is not a bilinear form in @xmath55 and @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "we now start to set up the path integral representation in the `` radial gauge '' . in the first place we observe that , contrary to speculations that the radial representation simply results from a straightforward coordinate transformation , it needs to be set up on a discretized time mesh from the beginning . a translation which respects the requirement that the integrals converge , irrespective of the sequence of the various integrations ,",
    "is the following : @xmath57 \\int \\prod_{\\sigma }     d[f_{n,\\sigma},f^{\\dagger}_{n,\\sigma } ] e^{-s_f-     s_b+\\delta\\sum_n(i\\lambda_n + \\lambda_0)}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 \\nonumber\\\\ s_b & = & \\delta \\sum_{n=1}^{n } ( r_n^2-\\epsilon ) ( i\\lambda_n + \\lambda_0 ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath59 with @xmath60 the number of time steps .",

    "we thus arrive at the conclusion that the integrations over the bosonic and the constraint fields can be replaced by the simple procedure demonstrated in eq .",

    "to summarize , we have introduced a new path integral representation for slave bosons in the radial gauge .",
    "it is defined on a discretized time mesh , and has a well - defined continuum limit .",

    "the extension to non - local terms in the lagrangian will be discussed in section  [ sec : nonloc ] where we also present a technique how to handle the integration over the amplitude field @xmath80 .",

    "we have the following assignment of electron fields to the previously introduced auxiliary fields : @xmath91 the product composition is just the expression eq .",
    "( [ cop ] )  only the choice of the time steps has to be confirmed .",

    "`` complete chain '' denotes a product of grassmann numbers over all time steps , either of the form @xmath92 or , equivalently , as @xmath93 which both result from the expansion of the exponentiated action , and only the integration of such complete chains results in a non - zero value of the path integral .",
    "the first form can be characterized as a `` hole chain '' since it corresponds to the hole line in fig .  1 ( top line ) .",

    "consequently , in a hopping expansion of the partition sum , @xmath144 would be related only to those paths where there is no change in occupancy on one or several sites over the entire imaginary time interval .",
    "finally we apply this scheme to lattice models .",
    "the measure of the functional integral is the same as for the single site problem except that all fields now carry a site index .",
    "the potential term , introduced above to enforce physical values for the amplitude of the slave bosons , may be implemented as a global term .",
    "it is independent of the site index . in summary",
    ", we find for spin-@xmath153 fermions on a lattice , interacting through an arbitrary coulomb - like interaction , which is locally infinitely strong , the following expressions for the action in the language of radial - gauge slave bosons : @xmath154 where : @xmath155 \\nonumber\\\\ s_b&= & \\delta \\sum_{i , n } \\left ( i\\lambda_{i , n}(x_{i , n } -1 ) + w x_{i , n } ( x_{i , n } - 1 )   + v_{i , j } ( 1-x_{i , n } ) ( 1-x_{j , n } ) \\right ) \\nonumber\\\\ s_t & = & \\sum_{n } \\sum_{i , j,\\sigma } \\delta\\ ; t_{i , j } \\ , x_{i , n+1 } f^{\\dagger}_{i , n+1,\\sigma } f_{j , n,\\sigma } x_{j ,",

    "as an example of how this method works for a lattice problem we solve the ising chain in appendix  [ app : kr ] .",
    "models of strongly interacting lattice fermions have been the focus of many publications on the mott - hubbard metal - insulator transition , itinerant magnetism and strange metallic phases in recent years .",
    "apart from the thorough analysis of the anderson impurity case @xcite , slave boson approaches have been mainly restricted to saddle point evaluations .",
    "however low energy spin fluctuations , for example , can not be implemented adequately , as quantum spin fluctuations are only included as perturbation .",
    "furthermore , this technique is not suitable to discuss non - fermi liquid behavior , as corrections of higher order in @xmath13 have to be included .",
    "this necessitates to further pursue non - perturbative slave boson approaches .",
    "here we considered the construction of a functional - integral formalism in the radial gauge which is not restricted to fluctuations around the @xmath15 saddle point .",
    "it is defined on a discretized time mesh , and has a well - defined continuum limit .",
    "we restricted our considerations to models in the limit of large ( positive ) on - site energy , that is , we work in the constrained fock space with no double occupancy .",
    "these models allow , in the radial gauge , to perform the functional integrals with real bosonic fields .",
    "the phase(s ) can be absorbed in the constraint lagrange multipliers which are thereby promoted to real ( time - dependent ) fields .",
    "dynamics of the radial fields themselves does not exist ( as discussed in appendix  [ app : rad ] ) .",
    "they serve to enforce the constraint for each time step by keeping track of the motion of empty sites , as exemplified for the local problem in eqs .",

    "( [ fprop ] ) .",
    "this procedure can be extended to other slave boson representations as , for example , to the kotliar - ruckenstein slave bosons , the representation of which is given for the ising chain in appendix  [ app : kr ] @xcite .",
    "non - local terms in general render the functional integral unsolvable .",
    "yet coulomb - like terms with non - local density - density interactions can be rewritten in bilinear form with radial fields , that is , they represent gaussian terms in the functional integral ( eq .",
    "( [ nloc ] ) in section  [ sec : nonloc ] , and also other non - local interactions may be rewritten in bilinear form , e.g. , the ising spin coupling within the kotliar - ruckenstein representation , see appendix  [ app : kr ] ) .",
    "this is neither possible in the canonical fermionic representation nor in the cartesian representation for slave bosons .",
    "these bilinear terms in the lagrangian generate a finite dispersion for the ( radial ) slave particles . in order to keep the bosonic part gaussian and to allow for a momentum space representation",
    ", one has to extend the range of integration for the square of the radial field to minus infinity .",
    "it can be implemented with the observation that the functional integration stays correct if we add an additional global gaussian term , that is , a potential term @xmath157 where @xmath158 is the square of the radial part of the slave boson , and send @xmath150 at the end .",
    "this proved to be a valid procedure to constrain the amplitude of the slave boson to the physical values 0 and 1 , without introducing any additional complications ( see appendices  [ app : kr ] and [ app : gf ] , and the paragraph with eqs .",
