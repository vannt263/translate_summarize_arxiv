    "semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( sidis ) allows to investigate not only parton distributions but also shed light on parton hadronization process . during the data analysis of this reaction it is necessary to account for the qed radiative corrections spoiling experimental observables .    the lowest order radiative corrections to sidis were first calculated for the scattering of the polarized particles and three - fold cross section in  @xcite .",
    "these calculations allowed to develop the code sirad , which represented a modification of dis program polrad  @xcite .",
    "then in  @xcite the calculation of radiative corrections was generalized for unpolarized five - fold cross section and code haprad was developed . in all these calculations bardin - shumeiko covariant",
    "approach  @xcite was used for cancellation of infrared divergences . at last in  @xcite the contribution of exclusive radiative tail",
    "was studied and a new version of haprad ( named * 2.0 * ) was written .    in the present work we consider another background process for a specific semi - inclusive reaction , in which the detected hadron is identical to the initial one .",
    "preliminary experimental data from jlab  @xcite showed that in the kinematic region near @xmath2 the measured cross section exceeded the calculated one - photon exchange ( born ) contribution and the excess could not be described by the radiative corrections calculated before .",
    "it was noticed that the main contribution in this region came from the exclusive lepton pair electroproduction . in spite of its higher qed order ( suppressed by @xmath3 ) this process",
    "is enhanced by the square of proton electromagnetic form - factors at low @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , in some specific kinematics the contribution of this process compete with sidis reaction cross section .",
    "the matrix elements of the lepton pair electroproduction and the phase space of this process are considered in the next section .",
    "the contribution from two photon emission are also considered there as the process of the same order . numerical result and conclusion presented in the next sections .",
