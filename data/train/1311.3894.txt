    "this is the 3rd paper in the series , `` continuum halos in nearby galaxies  an evla survey '' ( chang - es ) whose goals are to map a sample of 35 edge - on galaxies at l - band ( 1.5 ghz ) and c - band ( 6.0 ghz ) in all four stokes parameters , in a variety of configurations of the expanded very large array ( evla ) .",
    "the evla is now known as the karl g. jansky very large array ( jvla ) of the national radio astronomy observatory and we will refer to it as the jvla from now on .",
    "a complete description of the galaxy sample and goals of the survey can be found in @xcite ( hereafter , paper 1 ) and first results based on early test data of ngc  4631 can be found in @xcite ( hereafter , paper 2 ) .",
    "ugc  10288 ( table  [ table : prop - ugc10288 ] ) is a member of the lyon group of galaxies 404 ( lgg-404 ) @xcite which contains only two other , widely separated members : ugc  10290 , 1.0 deg ( 0.61 mpc , assuming the distance of ugc  10288 ) to the north , and ngc  6070 , 1.4 deg ( 0.86 mpc ) to the north - west .",
    "ugc  10288 , itself , is edge - on ( inclination of 90 deg ) and is listed in the revised flat galaxy catalog @xcite .",
    "ugc  10288 has not previously been observed extensively , but it has been a target in a few searches for high latitude emission .",
    "@xcite detected a few h@xmath6 spurs extending to 1 kpc below the galaxy s disk at an emission measure level of 40 pc @xmath7 .",
    "follow - up single - slit optical spectra at two positions @xcite then revealed emission lines to a vertical z height of z = 3 kpc and showed that the line ratios were best described by composite photoionization / shock models .",
    "an h@xmath6 observation by @xcite was too low in signal - to - noise ( s / n ) to detect more than the brightest disk emission .",
    "@xcite claim a dust absorption exponential scale height that is unresolved at 1.2 arcsec resolution ( 198 pc ) .",
    "of these references , only @xcite has published an original image of the galaxy .    aside from the 1.4 ghz national radio astronomy observatory vla sky survey ( nvss ) ,",
    "whose rms noise is 450 @xmath5jy beam@xmath2 in a 45 arcsec beam @xcite , the only previous radio continuum observation of ugc  10288 was made by @xcite at 5.0 ghz to an rms limit of 90 @xmath5jy beam@xmath2 with a beam of 14.5@xmath8 .",
    "the latter image shows essentially a point source with a slight elongation to the north which has been interpreted as evidence for a radio halo @xcite . because of these new jvla observations",
    ", however , we now know that this elongation is due to a strong background double - lobed extragalactic radio source ( egrs ) .",
    "our chang - es observations achieve a best rms of 3 @xmath5jy beam@xmath2 for a single array / frequency band combination ( c - array , c - band ) , and provide a range of spatial resolution from 3.0 arcsec to 37 arcsec , significantly improving on these previous data .",
    "observations and data reductions of ugc  10288 were similar to those described for the test data in paper 2 .",
    "however , there were also some differences and , since this is the first paper describing our ` regular ' ( as opposed to ` test ' ) observations , we describe each step fully below .",
    "note that these data reductions are consistent with current standard continuum tutorials , unless otherwise indicated .",
    "observations were carried out using the jvla during its commissioning period in l - band ( b , c , and d arrays ) and at c - band ( c and d arrays ) .",
    "a log of the observational set - up for each jvla configuration and each frequency band is given in table  [ table : obs ] .",
    "a single array and frequency combination will be referred to as an ` observation ' in the following . as can be seen ,",
    "the same calibrators were used for each observation , and the same correlator set - up was used .",
    "we introduced a gap in the frequency band coverage at l - band ( from 1.503 to 1.647 ghz ) because of persistent strong interference in that frequency range .",
    "the observations were carried out in a standard fashion with scans of the source flanked by scans on a complex gain calibrator ( j15570001 ) that was near it in the sky .",
    "we will refer to this source as the ` secondary calibrator ' .",
    "in addition , a scan was made on a bright calibrator of known flux density and brightness distribution ( 3c  286 ) , i.e. the ` primary calibrator ' ( this source is also used for the bandpass and polarization angle calibration ) .",
    "finally , a scan was also carried out on a calibrator that was known to have negligible polarization ( j1407 + 2827 = oq  208 ) , the latter to determine the polarization leakage ( see sect .  [",
    "sec : p_cal_imag ] ) .",
    "the longest consecutive scan on the galaxy at any array , between scans of the secondary calibrator , was 25 minutes .",
    "scans of 3c286 , j15570001 , and j1407 + 2827 were typically , 7.5 to 11 minutes , 4.5 minutes , and 8 to 11 minutes , respectively . for each observation ,",
    "the galaxy was observed within a scheduling block ( sb ) that included other galaxies .",
    "this allowed us to observe any given galaxy near the beginning of the sb and then again near the end , so that the broadest possible uv coverage could be achieved .",
    "for ugc  10288 , the gaps in time varied with array and frequency , ranging from about 1.5 to 4.8 hours .",
    "data were reduced using the common astronomy software applications ( casa ) package , versions 3.3 and 3.4 , and each observation was reduced in an identical fashion , as described below , unless otherwise indicated .",
    "note that jvla antennas detect right ( r ) and left ( l ) circularly polarized radiation . in the following description , r and l are treated separately in any antenna - based calibration and the parallel hands ( rr and ll ) are treated separately in any baseline - based calibration .",
    "calibration of the cross - hands ( rl and lr ) is discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : p_cal_imag ]    a copy of the data set was first made and then hanning smoothed so as to more easily detect bad data .",
    "an initial pass of flagging then took place to remove the worst of the radio frequency interference ( rfi ) .",
    "an antenna position correction table was then produced , if needed , based on known positions as posted by nrao .",
    "an antenna - based delay correction table was then formed using one - minute of the scan on the primary calibrator , during which the antenna position correction table was applied on the fly .",
    "delay errors produce phase slopes as a function of frequency ; we found delay corrections of 6 ns or less , as determined with respect to a reference antenna in the same polarization ( r or l ) .",
    "the same rfi flags determined in the first pass of the hanning smoothed data as well as the antenna position correction and delay correction tables were then applied to the original non - hanning smoothed data .",
    "this ordering of steps ( which is not described in standard casa tutorials ) was needed because delay corrections must be applied to non - hanning - smoothed data , whereas locating rfi is most effectively done on hanning - smoothed data .",
    "the corrected data were then split off into a separate data set and hanning - smoothed for further processing .",
    "another round of rfi flagging was then carried out until there were no obvious amplitude departures from typical values .",
    "in addition , each observing band contains contiguous spectral windows ( table  [ table : obs ] ) , each with its own bandpass response .",
    "since the bandpass response in each spectral window declines strongly at the upper and lower edges , we flagged 5 channels at both the upper and lower ends of each spectral window .",
    "jvla observing parameters did not allow us to overlap the spectral windows without losing significant total bandwidth so that , after flagging , there are gaps of 10 channels between each spectral window .",
    "the flux density of the primary calibrator was then set for each channel in the band using a known model for stokes i.    an initial calibration table of phase as a function of time for the primary calibrator was made for a small range of channels at the center of each spectral window ( where the bandpass response is reasonably flat ) .",
    "a bandpass calibration table was then made using the same calibrator , applying the previous phase calibration table on the fly .",
    "application of the initial phase calibration table ensures that no decorrelation occurs when vector averaging the data to determine bandpass solutions .",
    "bandpasses were determine for each antenna and each spectral window .",
    "the initial phase calibration table is then no longer used .",
    "phase and amplitude calibration tables were then determined separately ( first phase and then amplitude ) for the primary calibrator , the secondary calibrator , and the polarization leakage calibrator .",
    "the bandpass calibration table was applied on the fly during these steps and the phase calibration table was also applied on the fly when the amplitude calibration table was formed .",
    "phase solutions were determined for each integration time for the primary calibrator , and for each scan for the secondary and polarization leakage calibrators .",
    "amplitude solutions were determined per scan for all calibrators .",
    "flux densities for the secondary and polarization leakage calibrators were then found from the known primary calibrator values on a per spectral window basis .",
    "results for a representative frequency near the center of each band are given in table  [ table : obs ] .",
    "the results at l - band over the various independent observations agree to 1% for j1407 + 2827 and 3% for j15570001 . at c - band , the agreement is to within 0.2% for j1407 + 2827 and 1% for j15570001 .",
    "all calibration tables were then applied to the data ( calibrators plus galaxy ) to form a calibrated data set in total intensity , i. for the galaxy , the calibration solutions determined from the secondary calibrator were applied , interpolated linearly with time . at this point ,",
    "low level rfi , which was not evident in the uncalibrated data , became much more obvious .",
    "therefore another round of flagging ensued and the above steps were all repeated , with new tables made and a new calibration applied .",
    "the flux density data for the calibrators presented in table  [ table : obs ] refer to the final results .",
    "total intensity images were formed for each observation by first fourier transforming the uv data into the sky plane ( forming the ` dirty map ' ) and then deconvolving the ` dirty beam ' ( i.e. the point - spread function ) from the dirty map using the clark clean algorithm @xcite .",

    "the multi - scale clean assumes that the emission can be represented by a variety of spatial scales , rather than only point sources as has been largely done in the past .",
    "multi - frequency synthesis makes use of the fact that , at different frequencies within the band , the uv spacings ( measured in k@xmath10 ) are also different and therefore the uv plane is more filled in than would be the case for monochromatic observations .",
    "we also fit the emission across the band in each pixel with a spectrum @xcite of the form , @xmath11 , which , in practice , is expanded as a taylor series with 2 terms ( see paper 2 ) . at the end of the cleaning process",
    ", the image is constructed by reconvolving the clean components with a gaussian of the same full - width - half - maximum ( fwhm ) as the dirty beam .",

    "the images of figs .",
    "[ fig : lband ] and [ fig : cband ] are shown without a primary beam correction , but any flux density ( or other numerical ) measurements are made on primary beam - corrected images .",
    "the primary beam correction was carried out as described in paper 2 , except that the beam has now been constructed with frequency weighting that matches the frequency weighting of the data ( for example , the weighting that necessarily results from flagging )      polarization calibration proceeded in the same fashion for all data sets .",
    "the cross correlation data ( rl and lr ) were first inspected separately and additional flagging was carried out as needed .",
    "a known model for stokes q and u for the primary calibrator was introduced , based on formulae given in paper 2 . the relative antenna - based delay correction between r and l",
    "was then derived using the primary calibrator .",
    "the leakage terms between the r and l circularly polarized feeds were found from the polarization leakage calibrator ( table  [ table : obs ] ) .",
    "finally , the absolute polarization position angle on the sky was determined from the known position angle for the primary calibrator ( @xmath12 for 3c  286 ) . during each of these steps ,",
    "all previously determined calibration tables were applied on the fly .",
    "finally , all calibration tables , including the self - calibration table determined from the corresponding total intensity map , were applied to the rl and lr data .",
    "imaging of stokes q and u proceeded in the same fashion as for i but the largest spatial scale was dropped during cleaning ( except for d - array l - band ) since the extent of the polarized emission is not as great as in total intensity .",
    "maps of polarized intensity were then formed for each array and frequency , correcting for the bias introduced by the fact that p images do not obey gaussian statistics @xcite .",
    "maps of e vectors rotated by 90@xmath13 were also formed after first blanking all emission less than 3@xmath9 , where @xmath9 is the rms noise of the respective q and u maps , resulting in an uncertainty of @xmath14 10 degrees .",
    "these vectors would be equivalent to the intrinsic direction of the regular magnetic field , b , if there were no faraday rotation .",

    "the uv data at each frequency ( b , c , and d arrays at l - band and c and d arrays at c - band ) were combined in order to obtain higher s / n and more complete uv coverage for each of the bands .",
    "the results of these combinations are parameterized in table  [ table : combined ] and each map was also corrected for the primary beam as described above",
    ". we will refer to them as needed .",
    "the power and versatility of casa , moreover , along with the multi - array and frequency observations that we have carried out also allow us to form a _",
    "image from _ all _ arrays and frequencies .",
    "the self - calibrated uv data from all five observations are input into the _ clean _ algorithm and , with a point - by - point fit of the spectral index , an image can be made that corresponds to a frequency which is intermediate between l - band and c - band , i.e. at @xmath154.13 ghz .",
    "this process is time - consuming but produces a final image with improved sensitivity to spatial scales and , on average , lower rms .",
    "we show the result in fig .",
    "[ fig : all_colour ] , where the two images differ only in the uv weighting function adopted .    since the spectral index , @xmath6 ( @xmath11 ) ,",

    "note that similar spectral index maps were formed for each individual data set as well ( sect .",
    "[ sec : i_imaging ] ) , but we show only the combined array / frequency result because of its higher s / n . in principle , it is also possible to solve for curvature in the spectral index ( see paper 2 for examples ) ; however , the uncertainties become large , given the s / n in the disk of ugc  10288 , and we did not pursue this for ugc  10288 .    the remaining issue is to consider whether there might be missing flux from a lack of short spacings . at l - band , we detect all spatial scales less than 16 arcmin and , at c - band , less than 4 arcmin .",
    "the optical galaxy is 4.9 arcmin in diameter ( table  [ table : prop - ugc10288 ] ) but , as illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig : lband ] and [ fig : cband ] , the radio diameter does not extend beyond @xmath3 3 arcmin .",
    "moreover , we do not observe any ` negative bowls ' around the emission , as would be the case if there were missing spacings .",
    "consequently , there should be no missing flux in these data .",
    "a remarkable result of these observations is the discovery of a strong , double - lobed extra - galactic radio source ( egrs ) which is most certainly in the background of the ugc  10288 field .",
    "previous to these observations , the only radio continuum images obtained were of the galaxy and background source blended together ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "indeed , the previously measured flux density from the combined sources , @xmath16 = 26.1 mjy @xcite met our minimum flux density criterion ( 23 mjy ) for membership in the chang - es survey ( paper 1 ) ; however , it would have fallen far below that cut - off , had a measurement existed for the galaxy alone .",
    "we now see both the galaxy and the background source in detail .",
    "there is an optical point source at the core of the egrs ( fig .",
    "[ fig : all_colour ] ) , with sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) dr9 identifer , j161423.28 - 001211.8 , listed as a galaxy with a photometric redshift of @xmath17 = 0.388 @xmath14 0.026 .",
    "we have named this background source , _ chang - es a _ , and labelled it in fig .",
    "[ fig : lband]b .",
    "another strong source ( _ chang - es b _ , labelled in fig .  [",
    "fig : spitzer ] ) is blended with the disk of ugc  10288 in d - array l - band ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lband]a ) , making the ugc  10288 disk appear to be skewed towards the north - west in that figure .",
    "_ chang - es b _ also has an optical background galaxy at its center , namely j161419.79 - 001155.6 at @xmath17 = 0.39 @xmath14 0.11 , in agreement with the redshift of _ chang - es a_. therefore _ chang - es a _ and _ chang - es b _ possibly form a background pair .",
    "estimates of the flux densities of the various sources are given in table  [ table : derived - ugc10288 ] .",

    "[ fig : lband]b ) and d - array c - band ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cband]a ) maps . for both bands , the total flux density of ugc  10288 and _ chang - es a _ were measured together .",
    "then the flux density of _ chang - es a _ was estimated from a measurement within the two dashed lines shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cband]a , a width of 34 arcsec .",
    "the flux density of ugc  10288 alone was then measured in a region of equivalent width to the east of _ chang - es a _ along the galaxy s disk .",
    "assuming that this measured flux density is approximately equivalent to the flux density of ugc  10288 _ within _ the box occupied by _ chang - es a _ , it was then subtracted from the _ chang - es a _ measurement as a correction for the contribution of the galaxy s disk within the dashed lines . at l - band , this correction amounted to 4% of the flux density of _ chang - es a _ , and 22% of the flux density of ugc  10288 . at c - band ,",
    "the correction constituted 4% of the flux density of _ chang - es a _ and 32% of the flux density of ugc  10288 .",
    "in addition , at l - band , the totals were then summed and compared to the combined , blended emission from all three sources , i.e. ugc  10288 , _ chang - es a _ and _ chang - es b _ as measured in the d - array l - band image ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lband]a ) ; the totals agree to within 0.5% .",
    "the global spectral index of ugc  10288 was calculated from the flux densities as just described , the result given in table  [ table : derived - ugc10288 ] .",
    "the two sources are both clearly dominated by non - thermal emission .",
    "it is remarkable that ugc  10288 reveals extra - planar emission ( see next two subsections ) when the total flux density is only a few mjy .",
    "this leads us to consider the star formation rate ( sfr ) of the galaxy , since halo emission is often associated with such activity .",
    "ugc  10288 s sfr@xmath18 of 1.3 m@xmath1 yr@xmath2 as given in table  [ table : prop - ugc10288 ] , has been calculated from infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ) data ( paper 1 ) , but , like the radio continuum , the ir emission will certainly be contaminated by emission from _ chang - es a_.    a closer inspection of the iras flux densities , moreover , suggests foreground contamination as well .",
    "given the observed iras 60 to 100 @xmath5 m flux density ratio of ugc  10288 ( @xmath19 = 0.236 ) , the galaxy appears to be extremely cold .",
    "in fact , this flux density ratio is @xmath320% smaller ( colder ) than that for the most extreme ( coldest ) galaxy included in the dale & helou ( 2002 ) spectral energy distribution ( sed ) models of normal star - forming galaxies . if _",
    "chang - es a _ is indeed a background radio galaxy , we naively would not expect it to be colder than all galaxies in the local universe .",
    "if anything , we would expect a warmer temperature arising from hot dust being powered by the accreting black hole .",
    "therefore , it seems that the most likely explanation for the cold dust temperature is significant contamination by difficult - to - remove foreground cirrus emission that is contributing to the iras flux densities . given these issues ,",
    "an alternative approach is to use the calibrated , known radio continuum - fir relation to estimate the sfr of ugc  10288 from its radio continuum emission as estimated in sect .",
    "[ sec : flux ] with _ chang - es a _ s flux density subtracted . for this , we adopt the calibrations of @xcite which use a kroupa initial mass function ( imf ) and a supernova cutoff of 8 m@xmath1 .",
    "the sfr estimated from the thermal radio continuum requires an electron temperature which we take to be 10@xmath20 k. the sfr estimated from the non - thermal radio continuum requires a knowledge of the non - thermal spectral index , @xmath21 , whereas we have , from the observed flux densities of table  [ table : derived - ugc10288 ] , a global spectral index of @xmath22 , using the convention ,  ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "however , we can estimate @xmath21 by combining the thermal and non - thermal calibrations of @xcite ( their eqns .",
    "11 and 14 ) and the constraint that the measured flux density is the sum of the non - thermal and thermal flux densities at any frequency .",

    "the use of this equation infers a thermal / non - thermal fraction which has a dependence on both frequency and @xmath21 .",

    "if we use a higher cut - off of 3@xmath9 to form the rm map , then the value of ` c ' becomes 64 rad m@xmath2 , rather than the 62 rad m@xmath67 seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : rot - measure ] , i.e. within the quoted 1@xmath9 uncertainty of @xmath14 10 rad m@xmath67 on the rm at the map edges ( see above ) .",
    "a 3@xmath9 cut - off also reduces the 1@xmath9 uncertainty in rm to @xmath14 7 rad m@xmath67 ; however , such accuracy is not required for this conclusion .",
    "a reversal between the azimuthal components of the disk field and halo field may be quite common among galaxies ; it has been found from modeling the magnetic field in the milky way from extragalactic rms ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and also in the northern part of the galaxy m51 @xcite .",
    "dynamo models can hardly explain such reversals if the same dynamo process operates in disk and halo , unless wind outflows allow such `` mixed parities '' @xcite .",
    "these results are necessarily preliminary , but the fact that many spectral channels are available in each of our observations ( table  [ table : obs ] ) lends itself well to the application of the rm synthesis technique @xcite to ugc  10288 .",
    "this requires that ( ra - dec - frequency ) cubes be formed for all data sets , and is an approach that will be attempted in the future .    .",

    "our observations have revealed some new surprises in ugc  10288 and the multi - array , multi - frequency approach has been essential in understanding this galaxy and disentangling its emission from the background radio galaxy . not only have we been able to correct for the emission of _ chang - es a _ , but _",
    "chang - es b _ would also have been assumed to be part of ugc  10288 at low resolution ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : lband]a ) , had multiple arrays ( i.e. higher resolutions ) not been used .",
    "moreover , the combination of all arrays and both frequencies has allowed us to detect high latitude emission in ugc  10288 .",
    "however , rather than having a broad scale halo , the high latitude features in ugc  10288 are discrete and , in the case of the arc - like feature seen extending towards the north on the eastern side of ugc  10288 s disk ( fig .  [",
    "fig : all_colour]b ) , also large .",
    "this feature extends to 21 arcsec ( @xmath77 3.5 kpc ) above the disk .",
    "it is interesting to explore some properties of this arc .",
    "for example , taking the estimate of the total magnetic field strength ( @xmath78 @xmath5 g , sect .",
    "[ sec : pol ] ) at the position marked in fig .",
    "[ fig : overlays_a]b ( 13.5 arcsec , or 2.2 kpc above the plane ) and using standard formulae ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the particle lifetime to synchrotron losses is @xmath79 yr .",
    "we do not know the outflow velocity , but it must be substantial in order to detect synchrotron radiation at this @xmath80-height .",
    "for example , if there were no additional losses , this lifetime implies ( for constant velocity ) a vertical flow of @xmath81 km s@xmath2 , and higher still if adiabatic or other losses are significant .",
    "the largest uncertainty , apart from those introduced by assumptions , belongs to @xmath6 which affects @xmath54 by @xmath14 a few @xmath5 g .",
    "since @xmath82 , then the uncertainty on @xmath83 due to the uncertainty on @xmath6 alone is @xmath8430% . what we see",
    ", therefore , is that outflow speeds can be substantial in localized regions , even in galaxies with modest sfrs .    as pointed out in sect .",
    "[ sec : overlays ] , the disk exponential scale heights in regions outside of the discrete high - latitude features is less than 1 kpc ( sect .  [",
    "sec : overlays ] , table  [ table : scaleheights ] ) and , even when one considers the scale height averaged over regions with and without radio extensions , the average is only @xmath3 1 kpc .",
    "this lack of a global radio halo , we suggest , is consistent with a rather modest sfr in ugc  10288 which we have modified downwards to be 0.4 - 0.5 m@xmath1 yr@xmath2 .",
    "that is , discrete extensions may be formed in relation to underlying disk activity , but not globally .",
    "a comparison could be made to m  31 which has a similar ( slightly lower ) sfr of 0.3 m@xmath1 yr@xmath2 @xcite and for which the synchrotron exponential scale height is only @xmath4 300 pc @xcite .",
    "it is clear that galaxies with similar global sfrs can be quite different in other ways .",
    "for example , although the sfrs of m  31 and m  33 are similar , their star formation efficiencies , sfe = sfr / m(h@xmath85 ) , where m(h@xmath85 ) is the molecular gas mass , differ by at least a factor of 3 ( * ? ? ?",
    "? * their figs .",
    "17 and 11 , respectively ) .",
    "similarly , galaxies with comparably low sfrs might show differences in the presence or absence of discrete high latitude radio continuum features .",
    "possible reasons might be the degree of clustering of star forming regions , or the relative strength and direction of the magnetic fields .",
    "when the various scale heights are averaged , irrespective of location , we find beam - corrected scale heights of @xmath86 kpc , @xmath87 kpc , where we have doubled the observed average h@xmath6 scale height to take into account the fact that the observed emission measure @xmath88 @xmath89 , and @xmath90 kpc .",
    "consequently the warm dust and thermal electron density scale heights are comparable and , arguably , so is the radio scale height , although the latter is far more irregular as fig .",
    "[ fig : overlays_a]b ( from which the values of table  [ table : scaleheights ] were obtained ) readily shows .    the high thermal fraction in ugc  1028 ( 44% in c - band , sect .  [ sec : sfr ] )",
    "also has been seen before , again in galaxies with low or modest sfrs .",
    "for example , @xcite find a c - band thermal fraction as high as 54% for the galaxy , ngc  5907 , and @xcite find thermal fractions of 50% to 70% in three late - type galaxies at 4.85 ghz compared to what is normally measured ( @xmath3 20% ) .",
    "these authors suggest that , in galaxies with higher sfrs , the non - thermal fraction increases because of the non - linear dependence of non - thermal luminosity on sfr , as noted in sect .",
    "[ sec : sfr ] .",
    "our results depend on an assumption of a linear dependence , but as already noted , we do not anticipate a significant change at the low sfr of ugc  10288 unless the non - thermal calibration is also markedly different .",
    "consequently , our results of a high thermal fraction are consistent with previous estimates for galaxies with similar sfrs .",
    "a significant new result is , of course , the detection of a double - lobed radio galaxy , _ chang - es a _ , behind the disk of ugc  10288 , which has allowed us to make some preliminary estimates of the regular magnetic field in ugc  10288 prior to a full rotation measure synthesis analysis . aside from the milky way",
    ", there have been only a few limited examples in which polarized background sources have been used to probe foreground galaxies @xcite and these were for galaxies of large angular size ( m  31 and the large magellanic cloud ) . in the case of ugc  10288 , which is only 4.9 arcmin in diameter ,",
    "the 90 degree alignment of the double - lobed radio galaxy is so fortuitous that both the disk and halo regions of the foreground galaxy can be probed .    for an adopted electron density of @xmath91 @xmath73 a projected distance 1.5 kpc above the plane ( position ` c ' in fig .",
    "[ fig : rot - measure ] ) and a path length of 1 kpc , we find a regular field of @xmath92 2 @xmath5 g parallel to the line of sight . at 3.5 kpc above the plane ( position",
    "` b ' in fig .",
    "[ fig : rot - measure ] ) with @xmath93 @xmath73 , @xmath94 @xmath5 g , suggesting a reversal of the azimuthal field above the plane .",
    "these values are still preliminary . nevertheless , _",
    "chang - es a _ has the potential to be a powerful probe of both @xmath95 and @xmath96 in regions in which neither are measured directly via radio emission . at the lower position ( ` c ' ) , for example , the h@xmath6 emission has already dropped to the level of the noise ( fig .  [",
    "fig : overlays_a]a ) .",
    "this map has a 3@xmath9 emission measure noise limit of 13 pc @xmath7 @xcite which implies that any electron density less than @xmath97 @xmath73 over the same path length would not have been detected ( adjusting as @xmath98 for a different path length , @xmath99 ) .",
    "at the same time , our sampling of the total magnetic field strength in the discrete northern arc , 2.5 kpc above the plane , reveals a rather strong total magnetic field @xmath78 @xmath5 g ( sect .  [ sec : pol ] ) .",
    "although not at the same position as rotation measures were measured , the implication is that field strengths in discrete high latitude features could be similar to those in the disk , possibly because of field compression in the arc .",
    "a similar result was found for ngc  5775 @xcite for which x - shaped extensions have fields almost as strong as in the disk , although the latter galaxy has , by contrast , a high sfr and global radio halo .",
    "ngc  4631 also has a relatively strong halo field @xcite .",
    "it is unlikely that discrete strong high latitude features could be a result of a mean - field dynamo alone . localized sf",
    "activity in the underlying disk is likely contributing to this feature .",
    "we have obtained jvla wide - band radio continuum data of ugc  10288 in both total power as well as polarized intensity as part of the chang - es program ( paper 1 ) .",
    "three different array configurations ( b , c , and d ) at two frequencies , 1.5 ghz ( l - band ) and 6 ghz ( c - band ) have been used and careful attention has been paid to the techniques needed to reduce wide - band data . moreover , we have combined all total intensity data to form a single map along with its spectral index , applicable to the intermediate frequency of 4.1 ghz . the combined data image has revealed new features in ugc  10288 that were too faint to be seen in the individual data sets .",
    "@xmath100 we have discovered a background double - lobed extragalactic radio source , which we have named _ _ chang - es a _ _ ( @xmath0 ) behind and",
    "perpendicular to the disk of ugc  10288 . in previous observations ,",
    "this source had been blended with ugc  10288 .",

    "ugc  10288 would not have been in the chang - es survey had it not been blended with _",

    "@xmath100 at high resolution , there is a trend for high latitude radio emission to occur above gaps in the underlying h@xmath6 emission ; however , we can not confirm whether this relationship is a physical one because of uncertainty in the line - of - sight location of the features .",

    "<S> this 3rd paper in the chang - es series shows the first results from our regular data taken with the karl g. jansky very large array ( jvla ) . </S>",
    "<S> the edge - on galaxy , ugc  10288 , has been observed in the b , c , and d configurations at l - band ( 1.5 ghz ) and in the c and d configurations at c - band ( 6 ghz ) in all polarization products . </S>",
    "<S> we show the first spatially resolved images of this galaxy in these bands , the first polarization images , and the first composed image at an intermediate frequency ( 4.1 ghz ) which has been formed from a combination of all data sets .    </S>",
    "<S> a surprising new result is the presence of a strong , polarized , double - lobed extragalactic radio source ( _ chang - es a _ ) almost immediately behind the galaxy and perpendicular to its disk . </S>",
    "<S> the core of _ chang - es a _ has an optical counterpart ( sdss j161423.28 - 001211.8 ) at a photometric redshift of @xmath0 ; the southern radio lobe is behind the disk of ugc  10288 and the northern lobe is behind the halo region . </S>",
    "<S> this background ` probe ' has allowed us to do a preliminary faraday rotation analysis of the foreground galaxy , putting limits on the regular magnetic field and electron density in the halo of ugc  10288 in regions in which there is no direct detection of a radio continuum halo .    </S>",
    "<S> we have revised the flux densities of the two sources individually as well as the star formation rate ( sfr ) for ugc  10288 . </S>",
    "<S> the sfr is low ( 0.4 to 0.5 m@xmath1 yr@xmath2 ) and the galaxy has a high thermal fraction ( 44% at 6 ghz ) , as estimated using both the thermal and non - thermal sfr calibrations of @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ugc  10288 would have fallen well below the chang - es flux density cutoff , had it been considered without the brighter contribution of the background source .    </S>",
    "<S> ugc  10288 shows discrete high - latitude radio continuum features , but it does not have a _ global _ radio continuum halo ( exponential scales heights are typically @xmath3 1 kpc averaged over regions with and without extensions ) . </S>",
    "<S> one prominent feature appears to form a large arc to the north of the galaxy on its east side , extending to 3.5 kpc above the plane . </S>",
    "<S> the total minimum magnetic field strength at a sample position in the arc is @xmath4 10 @xmath5 g . </S>",
    "<S> thus , this galaxy still appears to be able to form substantial high latitude , localized features in spite of its relatively low sfr . </S>"
