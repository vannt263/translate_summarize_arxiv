    "fermion zero modes on domain walls and cosmic strings have been known to exist since the 60 s @xcite .",
    "if the fermions are electrically charged , it is generally presumed that the string or wall is superconducting in the sense that it can sustain long - lived persistent currents @xcite .",
    "such superconducting strings could be present in the universe , and would have observable electromagnetic and other signatures ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "light superconducting strings could also be trapped in the center of our galaxy and could explain @xcite the observed positron annihilation line @xcite .",
    "the observable signatures of cosmic superconducting strings depend on the magnitude of the currents they carry .",
    "as the strings move under their tension , they cut across ambient astrophysical magnetic fields and this generates currents on the strings .",
    "interactions of charge carriers on the string are expected to limit the maximum current that a string can carry  @xcite .",
    "hence it is important to understand the interaction of a superconducting string with an external magnetic field .    in this paper",
    "we consider a straight , static , current - carrying , string , placed in a background magnetic field .",
    "the magnetic field is assumed to be perpendicular to the string .",
    "the charge carriers on the string feel the background magnetic field via the lorentz force which is also perpendicular to the string . thus the ambient magnetic field tends to bend the charge carriers off the string as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig.setup ] .",
    "the dispersion relation for zero modes on a string ( with no external magnetic field ) is that for a massless particle @xmath9 where , to be specific , we have taken the @xmath10 sign .",
    "( if the zero mode propagates in the opposite direction along the string , we would have @xmath11 . )",
    "the dispersion relation for the remaining ( `` non - zero '' ) modes is of the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a mass associated with the mode . for scattering states ,",
    "@xmath13 is the mass of the fermion in vacuum , @xmath0 . for a particle in a zero mode state to escape",
    ", it has to transition into a scattering state .",
    "since a particle in a zero mode only has kinetic energy , to escape into the bulk , its kinetic energy has to transform into mass energy . for @xmath14 ,",
    "this is not forbidden by energy conservation because it is possible to find the scattered momentum , @xmath15 , such that @xmath16 .",
    "let us consider a particle in a zero mode with @xmath17 .",
    "the particle certainly has enough energy to escape the string .",
    "the question is whether an external magnetic field can trigger this escape . at first sight",
    "it would appear that the fermion zero mode is very fragile since it is a bound state as regards its motion perpendicular to the string , yet it is degenerate with continuum states that are unbound .",
    "such bound states are known to dissolve resonantly into the the continuum under the effect of even a very weak perturbation , for example , in the auto - ionization of excited atomic helium . however , as shown by fano @xcite , in order to destroy a bound state a perturbation must couple it to continuum states with which it is degenerate . due to the translational symmetry of the problem it is easy to see that a uniform magnetic field does not couple the zero mode to continuum states that are degenerate with it . one way to understand",
    "this result is to note that all the energy of the zero mode is kinetic energy , while only a fraction of the particle energy off the string is kinetic .",
    "to be ejected from the string , some of the kinetic energy of the zero mode has to get converted into mass energy , and the magnitude of the momentum of the particle off the string therefore has to be less than that of the zero mode .",
    "thus we are lead to the conclusion that at least perturbatively a uniform magnetic field does not destroy the zero mode by fano s mechanism .",
    "it is therefore necessary to analyse the effect of the magnetic field non - perturbatively in order to definitively settle the question . in this paper",
    "we carry out such a non - perturbative analysis .    for the reader who may not wish to go through all the details ,",
    "we briefly summarize our result for the dispersion relation for fermions on a string or domain wall in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "the dispersion relation for small wavevectors , @xmath18 , resembles that of a zero mode on a string without any magnetic field .",
    "intuitively , @xmath18 is the momentum of the particle and at zero momentum , there is no lorentz force and so the magnetic field plays no role .",
    "hence the dispersion relation is linear for small @xmath18 . on the other hand , at large @xmath18 , the magnetic field dominates and the dispersion relation is as if there is no domain wall . in this regime ,",
    "the energy is independent of @xmath18 , just as in the landau problem .",
    "the transition of the dispersion from linear in @xmath18 to independent of @xmath18 occurs when the effect of the domain wall is comparable to that of the external magnetic field , or approximately at @xmath19 where @xmath5 for a thin wall in the weak field limit , and @xmath6 for a thick wall of width @xmath7 .",
    "thus the fermions in the lowest energy level have a dispersion relation that is of the form @xmath20 this dispersion is exact in the thick wall limit and fits our numerical results reasonably well in other cases .",
    "the modified form of the dispersion relation for superconducting strings may be important in astrophysical applications as briefly described in the concluding section .",
    "the proper framework for discussing the effect of external magnetic fields on zero modes on strings is in terms of the field theory of scalar and gauge fields that gives a string solution , the fermions which have zero modes on the string , and the external magnetic field .",
    "such a model is quite complicated and it is desirable to find a simpler model with all the relevant physics .",
    "for this reason we consider a field theory in two spatial dimensions that has domain wall solutions , a fermion with zero modes on the domain wall , and a magnetic field .",

    "here @xmath42 are normalization constants and @xmath43 is the solution to the shifted harmonic oscillator equation which can be expressed in terms of hermite polynomials : @xmath44",

    "the key distinguishing features of the zero mode state are that it is localised in a direction perpendicular to the domain wall ( along the @xmath64-axis ) and has zero energy at @xmath63 . with a magnetic field turned on , in the present gauge",

    "the key question now is whether a well - behaved solution can be found at @xmath75 that will connect with the well - behaved solution at @xmath76 . since @xmath77 for @xmath75 , it is clear that the origin is a ( regular ) singular point for the differential equation ( [ eq : secondorder ] ) and it appears to be a possibility that of the two independent solutions near the origin only one is regular .",
    "however , by use of a series expansion , we can show that there are in fact two independent solutions that are both regular at @xmath75 .",
    "one has the series expansion @xmath78 the other has the expansion @xmath79 here we have taken @xmath80 near the origin .",

    "we would also like to ensure that the perturbation @xmath168 does not shift the zero mode energy outside the mass gap for @xmath169 or @xmath170 .",
    "therefore our criterion becomes @xmath171 , which leads to the condition @xmath121 . if @xmath162 was the only perturbation we would conclude that the zeroth - order approximation is accurate when @xmath167 or when @xmath172 .",
    "however , we must also take into account the perturbation @xmath161 .",
    "although nominally smaller than @xmath162 , @xmath161 perturbs the zero mode energy to first order and therefore has a more significant effect .",
    "the first order correction is @xmath173 applying the same reasoning as for the second order correction we conclude that the perturbation @xmath161 is insignificant when either ( i ) @xmath174 and @xmath175 or ( ii ) @xmath176 and @xmath177 .",
    "these conditions subsume the conditions for @xmath162 to be negligible and are therefore the conditions that must be satisfied for the validity of the thick wall approximation to the zero mode .",
    "we can find the dispersion relation of the zero modes for a given magnetic field by finding the roots of eq .",
    "( [ energyquant ] ) that satisfy @xmath178 for different values of @xmath18 . for this purpose",
    "it is useful to consider the expansion of the weber function in the complex plane in terms of the kummer confluent hypergeometric function @xmath179 : @xmath180 this representation is valid along the entire real axis . since it is simpler than any form we have found in the literature , we briefly sketch its derivation .",
    "we start by observing that the weber eq .",
    "( [ eqweber ] ) may be transformed to the confluent hypergeometric equation by changing to the independent variable @xmath181 and the dependent variable @xmath182 . by means of this transformation , which is valid for @xmath183",
    ", we obtain a confluent hypergeometric equation  @xcite with parameters @xmath184 and @xmath185 .",
    "thus we obtain the solution to eq .",
    "( [ eqweber ] ) @xmath186 here @xmath187 is a confluent hypergeometric function of the third kind  @xcite , which is well - behaved as @xmath188 , and the constant pre - factors have been inserted to be consistent with the usual convention  @xcite .",
    "we may now use a well known joining formula  @xcite relating @xmath187 to the standard confluent hypergeometric function @xmath189 to obtain the final result  ( [ hypergeometric ] ) .",
    "so far , our derivation applies only to @xmath183 , but we can see from the differential eq .",
    "( [ eqweber ] ) that @xmath190 is analytic at @xmath191 , and , since the function @xmath189 is known to be analytic over the entire complex plane , we conclude that eq .",
    "( [ hypergeometric ] ) holds along the entire real axis .",
    "we note that the standard treatises  @xcite both arrive at the representation eq .",
    "( [ hypergeometric ] ) , valid for @xmath183 , but offer a much more complicated continuation of it along the negative @xmath192-axis ( see , for example , the asymptotic analysis in  @xcite , sections 16.51 and 16.52 , or the identical discussion by  @xcite on p. 1641 ) .",
