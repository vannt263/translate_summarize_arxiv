    "let @xmath3 be the closed oriented surface of genus @xmath9 .",

    "elements of @xmath10 are determined by the images of the @xmath12 generators of @xmath2 , subject to the single relation defining @xmath2 .",
    "it follows that @xmath10 has a real algebraic structure ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , being a subset of @xmath13 , it is naturally equipped with a hausdorff topology .",
    "we can define an invariant @xmath14 , called the euler class , as an obstruction class or as the index of circle bundles associated to representations in @xmath10 ( see @xcite ) .    in @xcite ,",
    "which may be considered to be the starting point of the subject , goldman showed that the connected components of @xmath10 are exactly the fibers @xmath4 , for @xmath5 .",
    "he also proved that @xmath15 and @xmath16 consist of those injective representations whose image is a discrete subgroup of @xmath8 .",
    "milnor and wood had previously proved that the inequality @xmath17 holds for all @xmath18 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "goldman @xcite ( see also @xcite ) showed that every connected component @xmath4 is a smooth manifold of dimension @xmath19 , except for the component @xmath20 , whose singular points are the elementary representations .",
    "these connected components have been studied further .",
    "the group @xmath8 acts on @xmath10 by conjugation , and the quotient of @xmath16 ( respectively @xmath15 ) under this action is the teichmller space of @xmath3 ( respectively , the space of marked hyperbolic metrics with opposite orientation on @xmath3 ) .",
    "gallo , kapovich , marden and tan @xcite showed that all the representations ( in every connected component of @xmath10 ) satisfy a weaker metric condition .",
    "indeed , every representation in @xmath10 is the holonomy representation of a branched @xmath21-structure on @xmath3 , with at most one branched point in @xmath3 .",
    "moreover , tan showed that for every even @xmath22 such that @xmath23 , there is an explicit non - injective representation in @xmath4 , which is not the holonomy representation of any branched hyperbolic structure on @xmath3 .",
    "however , this explicit representation can be deformed into representations which are holonomy representations of branched hyperbolic structures on @xmath3 .",
    "it is still unknown whether the holonomy representations of branched hyperbolic structures on @xmath3 form a dense subset of @xmath10 .    in this text",
    "we take a more elementary point of view .",
    "we often consider representations as products of commutators in @xmath8 , and most of our results involve explicit representations .",
    "our first result is the following :    for all @xmath9 and all @xmath22 such that @xmath24 , non - faithful representations form a dense subset of the connected component @xmath4 .",
    "recently breuillard , gelander , souto and storm @xcite , and independently deblois and kent iv @xcite proved that the set of faithful representations is also dense , as the intersection of a countable family of open and dense sets .",
    "therefore theorem 1.1 shows that the set of non - faithful representations should be thought of as @xmath25 in @xmath26 .",
    "we then show that the euler class of a discrete representation is essentially determined by its image , as an abstract group . if @xmath27 is a non - cocompact fuchsian group , set @xmath28 .",

    "@xmath33 ( put @xmath34 if @xmath35 ) and set @xmath36 we have the following result :    let @xmath37 be a representation ( in any @xmath38 ) whose image is contained in @xmath27 .",
    "then @xmath39 is a multiple of @xmath40 .",
    "moreover , every multiple of @xmath40 is the euler class of some representation whose image is exactly @xmath27 .    in particular , there are no representations of non - zero euler class taking values in @xmath41 .",
    "we deduce the following proposition :    let @xmath22 be a fixed non - zero integer .",
    "there are only finitely many fuchsian groups @xmath27 such that there exists a representation ( of @xmath2 , for some @xmath9 ) with image contained in @xmath27 and with euler class @xmath22 .",
    "moreover , we have :    let @xmath9 and @xmath42 be such that @xmath43 , @xmath44 .",
    "the representations whose image is discrete form a nowhere dense closed subset of @xmath4 in @xmath10 .    in other words , there are few discrete representations of non - zero euler class . on the other hand , we have the following :    for every @xmath9 and every @xmath22 such that @xmath45 , there exists a discrete representation of euler class @xmath22 in @xmath10 .    those representations are given explicitly in terms of signatures of fuchsian groups .",
    "in particular , using magnus results from @xcite , these representations can be expressed using only matrices in @xmath46)$ ] .",
    "finally , we deduce a characterization of representations of odd euler class , which enables us to describe all the subgroups of @xmath8 that are the image of some discrete representation of odd euler class ( in some @xmath10 ) .",

    "otherwise , let @xmath52 be the number of @xmath30 s which are divisible by @xmath53 .",
    "we have then the following characterization :    a fuchsian group @xmath54 is the image of a representation ( of @xmath2 , for some @xmath9 ) if and only if @xmath27 is a cocompact fuchsian group such that @xmath52 is odd .",

    "the matrix @xmath70 is conjugate _ in @xmath8 _ to a matrix of the form @xmath71 .",

    "topologically , the lie group @xmath8 is a solid torus , and @xmath80 .",
    "moreover , for all @xmath81 , taking a lift @xmath82 is the same as lifting the homeomorphism @xmath83 to a homeomorphism of the universal cover of the circle . in other words",
    ", we have the following short exact sequence : @xmath84    in the diagram above , the sign of the generator in @xmath85 is determined by the choice of an orientation of @xmath86 . as in @xcite",
    ", we will denote by @xmath87 the image of this generator @xmath88 .",
    "note that , for all @xmath81 , the choice of a lift @xmath89 is well - defined up to a certain number of elementary translations @xmath90 , which are central in @xmath91 .",
    "the euler class @xmath39 of a representation @xmath37 is computed in the following way .",
    "consider the standard one relator presentation of @xmath2 given by @xmath92[a_2,b_2]\\cdots [ a_g , b_g]\\ ; \\rangle\\ ] ] for each generator @xmath93 in the above presentation of @xmath2 , choose an arbitrary lift @xmath94 . then @xmath39 is determined by means of the formula : @xmath95\\cdots [ \\widetilde{\\rho(a_g)},\\widetilde{\\rho(b_g)}]=z^{e(\\rho)}\\ ] ] obviously , @xmath39 does not depend on the choice of the lifts .",
    "indeed , two lifts differ by powers of @xmath90 , which disappear in the commutators , because @xmath90 is central in @xmath91 .",
    "in this section we give first an elementary proof of the following proposition , which is a particular case of theorem 1.1 :    for all @xmath22 such that @xmath43 , @xmath4 contains an explicit open set @xmath96 , in which non - injective representations are dense .",
    "we set @xmath97 .    in order to prove the proposition 3.1 , we first need some preliminaries .",
    "we then state two lemmas implying the proposition , and finally prove the two lemmas .",
    "every hyperbolic element in @xmath8 is the commutator of two elliptic elements .",

    "this trace takes every value from the interval @xmath101 , and the set @xmath102 $ ] is invariant under conjugation .",
    "thus every hyperbolic element is the commutator of two elliptic elements .",
    "if @xmath103 , or equivalently , if @xmath104 has a fixed point in @xmath86 , then there is a canonical lift @xmath105 of @xmath70 , in @xmath106 , which has fixed points in @xmath26 .    if @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 are defined only up to a power of the elementary translation @xmath111 , but the commutator @xmath112\\in \\widetilde{\\psl}$ ] is well - defined and independent on the choice of lifts , because @xmath90 is central in @xmath91 .    for all @xmath113 and for all @xmath114",

    "hence @xmath112[\\widetilde{c},\\widetilde{d}]=z^{2\\delta}$ ] , so the formulas @xmath124 define a representation @xmath37 of the fundamental group @xmath125[a_2,b_2 ] \\right.\\right\\rangle$ ] of the genus two surface @xmath126 , of euler class @xmath127 . therefore , by corollary c of @xcite this representation is faithful and discrete , which contradicts the assumption @xmath128 .      for all @xmath129 ,",
    "there exists a path @xmath130 such that @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "we are not concerned with the derivability of the function @xmath133 , but rather in the fact that it is not locally constant .",
    "the set @xmath96 is not empty .",
    "an element @xmath128 is conjugate to a unique matrix @xmath134 .",
    "if @xmath135 is non - zero , then the angle @xmath136 corresponding to @xmath137 is rational for a dense subset of the possible values of @xmath75 , hence the representation @xmath138 satisfies a relation of the kind @xmath139 , so that @xmath138 is not injective .",
    "thus these two lemmas imply proposition 3.1 .",
    "the two remaining sections consist of proofs of these two lemmas .",
    "let @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "let @xmath142 be the one - parameter subgroup of @xmath143 containing @xmath144 .",
    "that is , @xmath145 , @xmath146 and for all @xmath147 , @xmath142 commutes with @xmath144 .",
    ". then @xmath149=ab(t)bb(-t)a^{-1}b^{-1}=[a , b]$ ] .",
    "thus the formulas @xmath150 define a representation @xmath151 .",
    "moreover , @xmath131 .",
    "we claim that @xmath132 .",
    "up to conjugation  which does not change the value of the traces  we can write @xmath107 in an adapted basis under the form @xmath152 . in the same basis",
    "@xmath142 reads @xmath153 , where @xmath154 , @xmath155 , are suitable real functions .",
    "set @xmath156 .",
    "we compute @xmath157 and hence @xmath158 it suffices to show that this derivative is non - zero .",
    "notice that @xmath159 , and @xmath128 ( which does not contain @xmath118 ) so @xmath160 .",
    "hence , the claim would follow if we proved that @xmath161 .",
    "assume the contrary , namely that @xmath162 .",
    "we develop @xmath142 up to second order terms : @xmath163 now , @xmath164 , which implies that @xmath165 .",
    "therefore , for small enough @xmath166 ( and thus for all @xmath75 ) , @xmath142 is hyperbolic , which is a contradiction since we assumed that @xmath167 .         if @xmath23 , take a representation @xmath168 of euler class @xmath22 .",
    "assume that the standard generators of @xmath169 are denoted by the letters @xmath170 in order to avoid confusion with the generators @xmath171 of @xmath2 .",

    "set @xmath37 for the homomorphism defined by the formulas @xmath172 then @xmath129 .    if @xmath173 , it suffices to consider the case @xmath174 .",
    "then take a representation @xmath175 of euler class @xmath7 .",

    "the formulas @xmath177 define a representation @xmath178 . in order to prove that @xmath129 , we need to check that @xmath179 .",
    "but by maximality of the euler class of @xmath180 and proposition 3.2 , we know that @xmath181= \\widetilde{\\rho'([a_1,b_1])}^{\\text{\\rm can}}\\cdot z$ ] , and by proposition 3.3 we know that @xmath112= \\widetilde{\\rho'([a_1,b_1])}^{\\text{\\rm can}}$ ] .",
    "thus @xmath182 , as claimed .",
    "our proof of theorem 1.1 uses theorem 1.3 .",
    "we postpone the proof of both theorems for the next section .",
    "our main technical result , which will be used throughout this sequel , is the following :    let @xmath27 be the fuchsian group with signature @xmath184 .",
    "then the lift @xmath185 of @xmath27 in @xmath183 has the following presentation : @xmath186\\cdots[a_g , b_g]z^{2g-2+r }    \\end{array}\\right.\\right\\rangle\\ ] ]    take a poincar fundamental domain of @xmath27 in the hyperbolic plane @xmath61 . according to katok s notations ( @xcite )",
    ", we have the following picture in the example case where @xmath187 , @xmath188 , @xmath189 for @xmath190 and @xmath191 :        here @xmath192 is the only element of @xmath8 sending @xmath193 to @xmath194 , and similarly @xmath195 and @xmath196 .    now consider the identification of @xmath8 with the unit tangent bundle @xmath197 of the hyperbolic plane @xmath61 ( see @xcite , theorem 2.1.1 ) .",
    "then the universal lift @xmath91 of @xmath8 can be viewed as the unit tangent bundle @xmath197 together with an index number . and lifting elements of @xmath8 to @xmath55 is just taking the index number modulo 2 . given our prefered presentation of @xmath27 , in order to determine a presentation of @xmath185 we just have to know how the relations lift .",
    "one may lift @xmath192 to the rotation of positive angle @xmath198 , so that @xmath199 makes one ( positive ) turn around @xmath200 .",
    "hence the relation @xmath199 lifts to @xmath201 in @xmath91 .",
    "we now have to determine the lift of the long relation @xmath202\\cdots[a_g , b_g]$ ] in @xmath185 .    for this",
    ", we consider two vectors @xmath203 and @xmath204 based at each point @xmath205 or @xmath200 .        the element @xmath206 is defined ( see @xcite ) as the only element of @xmath8 sending @xmath207 to @xmath208 ; we choose its lift in @xmath91 to be the transformation of @xmath197 sending @xmath209 to @xmath210 .",
    "the same element also sends @xmath211 to @xmath212 .",
    "similarly , for the lift of @xmath213 to @xmath91 , take the transformation of @xmath197 sending @xmath214 to @xmath215 and @xmath216 to @xmath217 .",
    "then @xmath218 , @xmath219 , ... , @xmath220 .",
    "now define @xmath221 by @xmath222 .",
    "then @xmath223 , and @xmath224 is central in @xmath91 .",
    "moreover , @xmath225 , or equivalently , @xmath226 ( by the gauss - bonnet formula ( see also @xcite , theorem 4.3.2 ) ) .",
    "now , if the element @xmath202\\cdots[a_g , b_g]$ ] caused , say , @xmath227 turns in the index ( i.e. @xmath202\\cdots[a_g , b_g]=z^n$ ] ) , then we make @xmath228 turns after following the arrows @xmath229 , @xmath230 , @xmath231 , ... ,",
    "@xmath232 , @xmath233 and back to @xmath229 .",
    "now we need just compute this index in order to find @xmath227 .    the simplest way to do",

    "the index of this vector field at the point @xmath235 is @xmath237 ( the arrows point towards @xmath235 , hence the minus sign ) . and",
    "since @xmath226 , the index at @xmath236 is @xmath118 .",
    "hence , by the classical poincar - hopf index theorem , @xmath238 this gives the following presentation for @xmath185 : @xmath239\\cdots[a_g , b_g]z^{2 - 2g - r }    \\end{array}\\right.\\right\\rangle\\ ] ] which is obviously equivalent to our statement ( replace @xmath117 with @xmath90 ) .",
    "we could also count this index geometrically .",
    "first suppose for simplicity that @xmath240 .",
    "then the tail of our vector pointed to the center of the fundamental domain exactly once for every rotation , thus @xmath241 times . and we also turned around this center once negatively , so the index is @xmath242 .",
    "thus @xmath243 , or equivalently , the element @xmath202\\cdots[a_g , b_g]$ ] lifts to @xmath202\\cdots[a_g , b_g]h^{-r+2}$ ] in @xmath91 . in the general case ( @xmath244 ) one",

    "a very comparable result has been recently proved by glutsyuk in @xcite , for the set of representations of free groups into general lie groups , thereby answering a question of ghys .",
    "the case of odd euler class is somewhat simpler than the general case .",
    "even though the following results can be deduced from the latest part , the approach is often more elementary .",
    "the commutator map @xmath444 \\end{array}\\ ] ] defines an application @xmath445 \\end{array}\\ ] ] hence , there exists a continuous function @xmath446 such that for all @xmath18 , @xmath447\\cdots[\\rho(a_g),\\rho(b_g)]= \\varepsilon(\\rho)\\ ] ]        in particular , this gives a decomposition of @xmath10 into two sub - varieties of @xmath450 .",

    "these two algebraic varieties are irreducible .",
    "in fact the invariant @xmath452 is precisely the second stiefel - whitney class @xmath453 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath27 be a subgroup of @xmath8 of finite type and let @xmath185 be its lift to @xmath55 containing @xmath449 .",
    "( note that this is well - defined ) .",
    "then the two following assertions are equivalent :      if there exists a representation @xmath18 of odd euler class whose image is @xmath27 then by proposition 4.1 , @xmath313\\cdots[\\rho(a_g),\\rho(b_g)]=-1 $ ] so @xmath449 is indeed a product of commutators in the image of @xmath37 .",
    "conversely , suppose @xmath449 is a product of commutators in the group @xmath27 : @xmath451\\cdots[x_g , y_g]=-1 $ ] .",
    "let @xmath454 , ... , @xmath455 be a system of generators of @xmath27 .",

    "we can use this characterization to give an explicit example of a discrete representation of odd euler class as follows .",
    "let @xmath27 be the fuchsian triangular group of signature @xmath459",
    ". then @xmath27 has the following presentation : @xmath460 .",
