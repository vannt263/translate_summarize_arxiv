    "modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ; milgrom 1983 ) represents one of the most popular alternative to the commonly accepted dark - matter paradigm .",
    "this theory was put forward in the early eighties as a way to explain the observed flat rotation curves of disk galaxies without the need of hidden matter . in bekenstein & milgrom s ( 1984 ) formulation of mond , poisson s equation @xmath1 is replaced by the field equation @xmath2 = 4\\pi g \\rho , \\label{eqmond}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the standard euclidean norm , and @xmath4 is the gravitational potential for mond .",
    "the gravitational acceleration is @xmath5 just as the newtonian acceleration @xmath6 . for a system of finite mass , @xmath7 as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the position vector relative to the system s centre of mass .",
    "the function @xmath10 is constrained by the theory only to the extent that it must run smoothly from @xmath11 at @xmath12 ( the so - called `` deep - mond '' regime ) to @xmath13 at @xmath14 ( the newtonian regime ) , with the transition taking place at @xmath15 ( i.e. , when @xmath16 is of order of the characteristic acceleration @xmath17 ) .",

    "the theory has been quite successful , resisting several attempts at falsification ( see , e.g. sanders & mcgaugh 2002 ; bekenstein 2006 ; milgrom 2008 ; bekenstein 2009 ) . however , there are cases in which mond appears to have difficulties in explaining the observed data : the x - ray and gravitational lensing properties of clusters of galaxies ( e.g. , the & white 1988 ; sanders 2007 ; natarajan & zhao 2008 ) , and in particular the `` bullet '' cluster ( clowe et al .",

    "we present a further test of mond using the milky way globular clusters ( gcs ) .",
    "typical globular clusters are not ideal systems to test the mond hypothesis because they are characterized by high stellar - mass surface density and internal acceleration larger than @xmath0 .",
    "however , there are several cases of less dense gcs , with internal acceleration comparable to or smaller than @xmath0 , which represent good candidates to test mond ( baumgardt , grebel & kroupa 2005 , hereafter bgk05 ) .",
    "a complication that arise in testing mond with gcs is the so - called `` external field effect '' ( bekenstein & milgrom  1984 ) . in mond",
    "the _ internal _ dynamics of a system is affected by the presence of even an _ uniform _ external gravitational field @xmath25 . as a consequence ,",
    "the interpretation in the context of mond of gc dynamics is typically difficult because one needs to account for the presence of the external gravitational field due to the galaxy .",
    "an exception is represented by the gcs populating the outermost region of the galactic halo , which are far enough to experience only a negligible acceleration from the milky way ( @xmath26 ) , and therefore constitute an ideal laboratory to test mond .",
    "the application of mond to gcs has been studied by different authors by estimating the overall velocity dispersions of gcs through the virial theorem ( e.g. bgk05 ) or by deriving the their mond velocity - dispersion profiles through the jeans equations ( e.g. moffat & toth 2008 ) . as in newtonian gravity , also in mond the latter approach has the limitation that it is not based on self - consistent models , so that it is not guaranteed that there is a non - negative distribution function corresponding to the assumed density distribution .",
    "haghi et al .",
    "( 2009 ) solved this problem by obtaining equilibrium mond gc models as end - products of n - body simulations run with the numerical code  ( londrillo & nipoti 2008 ) , based on the mond potential solver described in ciotti , londrillo & nipoti ( 2006 ) .",
    "n - body models are useful when the external field is important and the gc is not spherically symmetric .",
    "when the external field is weak , the gc can be well represented by a spherical stellar system and it is possible to construct self - consistent models without resorting to simulations .    in this paper",
    "we present self - consistent , spherically symmetric models of stellar systems that are mond steady - state solutions of the fokker - planck equation , which are the analogues of newtonian king ( 1966 ) models .",
    "we use them to predict the mond velocity - dispersion profiles of gcs belonging to the outer galactic halo , which can be used to discriminate between mond and newtonian gravity . in section 2",
    "we describe the theoretical basis of our models and discuss their structural and kinematic properties .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the application of the models to a sample of six gcs located in the external parts of the galaxy .",
    "finally , we summarize and discuss our results in section 4 .",
    "to describe the phase - space distribution of a spherically symmetric star cluster in mond we choose the steady - state solution of the fokker - planck equation proposed by king  ( 1966 ) , but with equation  ( [ eqmond ] ) replacing poisson s equation .",

    "the density @xmath35 and the 3d velocity dispersion @xmath36 can be obtained by integrating the distribution function : @xmath37 the above equations can be written in terms of dimensionless quantities by substituting @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the central cluster density and @xmath40 is the core radius ( king 1966 ) , so we get @xmath41 and @xmath42 the above expressions give the density and velocity - dispersion radial profiles as functions of the dimensionless potential @xmath43 , which can be calculated by solving the modified poisson equation  ( [ eqmond ] ) with the boundary conditions at the centre @xmath44 in spherical symmetry equation  ( [ eqmond ] ) can be written in the form @xmath45=4\\pi g \\rho\\ ] ] or , using dimensionless quantities , @xmath46= -9\\tilde{\\rho},\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is a dimensionless parameter , which is smaller for systems closer to the deep - mond regime .    for a given choice of the ( @xmath48 ) pair , @xmath43 has been obtained by numerically integrating equation  ( [ poiss_eq ] ) from the centre imposing the boundary conditions indicated in equation  ( [ bound_eq ] ) ( see appendix ) .",
    "the corresponding radial density and 3d velocity - dispersion profiles are then projected on the plane of the sky , giving the line - of - sight ( los ) velocity dispersion @xmath49 as @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the surface density .",
    "the described procedure is straightforward and produces self - consistent equilibrium models , truncated at a tidal radius @xmath52 .",
    "a particular case of this family of models was studied by brada & milgrom  ( 2000 ) , who constructed steady state king models of stellar systems in deep - mond [ @xmath53 regime as initial conditions for their n - body simulations of dwarf galaxies . here",
    "we extend their models to general mond cases in which the internal acceleration is not necessarily everywhere small as compared to @xmath0 .",
    "the models presented in the above section were constructed neglecting the effects of an external field on the modified poisson equation ( [ eqmond ] ) , so some considerations on the limits of validity of the models are necessary . the mond field of a system with density distribution @xmath54 in the presence of the external field @xmath25 can be obtained by solving equation ( [ eqmond ] ) with boundary conditions @xmath55 for @xmath8 ( bekenstein & milgrom 1984 ) .",
    "computing such a field is in general a difficult task , because the presence of an external field breaks the symmetry of the system .",
    "however , the departure from spherical symmetry can be safely neglected in the external acceleration regime @xmath56 ( milgrom & bekenstein 1987 ) , so our spherically symmetric models are not valid when the external field is comparable to or larger than @xmath0 .",
    "another important issue is the concept of escape velocity in mond models . in the formulation presented in section [ mod_sec ]",
    ", the velocity distribution at a given radius is truncated at the local escape velocity @xmath57 ( see also sanchez - salcedo & hernandez 2007 ; wu et al .",
    "this condition is no longer valid in the case of an isolated mond model ( @xmath58 ) , in which a particle with arbitrarily large speed remains bound to the cluster . in a more realistic case , when the system is surrounded by other objects ( @xmath59 ) , the total gravitational potential will admit a maximum value @xmath60 at a finite distance from the cluster centre ( see wu et al .",
    "a cluster star located at a distance @xmath29 from the cluster centre , with a speed @xmath61 , will reach the radius @xmath52 with non - null velocity , feel the external potential as dominant and never return .    summarizing , on the basis of the above considerations on the external field effect and on the escape velocity in mond , our models are acceptable approximations of gcs when the external acceleration field lies in the range @xmath62 .",

    "as can be seen , the mond model has a potential well @xmath833 times deeper than the newtonian model s one .",
    "correspondingly , the mond model has a substantially higher acceleration than the newtonian model at all radii ( see the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ pot ] ) .",
    "it must be noted that in the considered example , which is representative of a low surface - density cluster , the newtonian acceleration is at all radii significantly lower than @xmath0 , so the effects of mond are large at any distance from the cluster centre .    in figs .",
    "[ xi ] and [ w ] the surface - density and los velocity - dispersion profiles for a set of models with different choices of @xmath84 and @xmath70 are shown . from fig .",
    "[ xi ] it is apparent that mond models predict steeper density and velocity - dispersion profiles with respect to newtonian models having the same values of @xmath69 .",
    "indeed , the larger acceleration predicted by mond at large distances from the cluster centre implies a steeper increase of the effective potential @xmath28 that reaches zero at a smaller radius ( @xmath85 ) with respect to the newtonian case .",
    "mond models tend to newtonian ones when large values of @xmath70 are considered ( see fig .",
    "[ xi ] ) : the newtonian case can be reproduced for @xmath86 ( i.e. no characteristic acceleration ) . in this limit",
    ", @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and equation  ( [ poiss_eq ] ) approaches poisson s equation .",
    "@xmath84 measures the depth of the gravitational potential well , so  like in newtonian king models  as @xmath89 , the escape velocity goes to infinity at any distance from the cluster centre , the velocity distribution tends to the maxwellian distribution , and the models approach the isothermal sphere ( see fig .",
    "[ w ] ) .",
    "we note that , with the exception of the isothermal sphere , in our mond models @xmath90 goes to zero when @xmath29 approaches the tidal radius ( see right panels of fig .  [ xi ] and fig .  [ w ] ) , as it must for the system to be bounded .",
    "in fact , as @xmath91 the effective potential @xmath92 and the velocity distribution defined in equation  ( [ df_eq ] ) tends to a null width function .",
    "this is not the case for the isothermal sphere whose distribution function has the same shape regardless of the potential , and it is not truncated , though having finite mass in mond ( milgrom  1984 ) .",
    "the examples shown in the previous section suggest that the shape of the velocity - dispersion profile of a gc of given density profile can be quite different in mond and newtonian gravity .",
    "this makes the velocity - dispersion profiles of gcs a useful tool for distinguishing between mond and newtonian gravity .",
    "here we apply our models to specific gcs , which may be used to test the mond theory by combining measures of surface - brightness and los velocity - dispersion profiles .",
    "the models presented in this paper are valid in the external acceleration range @xmath93 ( see section  [ ext_sec ] ) . in spite of this limitation ,",
    "a number of gcs belonging to the galactic halo satisfy this constraint .",
    "unfortunately , although the surface - brightness profiles of these clusters are well measured ( mclaughlin & van der marel 2005 , hereafter mvdm05 ) , to date none of them have accurate velocity - dispersion profiles .",
    "a first attempt at estimating the velocity - dispersion profile of ngc2419 has been done recently by baumgardt et al .",
    "( 2009 ) .",
    "here we compare the velocity - dispersion profiles predicted by the newtonian and mond models that reproduce the surface - brightness profiles of six gcs located in the outer halo of the milky way ( at distances @xmath94 kpc from the galactic centre ) .",
    "these clusters ( listed in table  1 ) are subject to an external galactic acceleration @xmath95 , so they are fully in the regime of validity of our models .",
    "though the masses and physical sizes of gcs are known only with non - negligible uncertainties , it is useful to discuss first the idealized case in which these quantities are given . in other words , for each object we fix a value of the mass - to - light ratio @xmath96 and of the cluster distance , valid for both newtonian and mond models , which is used to convert surface brightness in surface mass density .",
    "we defer to section  [ sec : moverl ] a discussion of the effects of varying @xmath96 and distance . for newtonian models we adopt the central dimensionless potentials @xmath84 , core radii @xmath73 and masses @xmath72 from mvdm05 .",
    "for mond models , we adopt the cluster mass estimated by mvdm05 and search for the values of @xmath69 and @xmath70 that best reproduce the surface - density profile of the corresponding newtonian models .    in table  1 the main structural properties derived for the six considered clusters",
    "are summarized . for eridanus ( which is not included in the catalog of mvdm05 ) we adopted the concentration , core radius , visual absolute magnitude given by harris ( 1996 ) and estimated its mass by adopting a mass  v - band - luminosity ratio @xmath97 ( the same value adopted by mvdm05 for pal 4 , which has similar age and metallicity",
    "; catelan 2000 ) . in both newtonian and mond cases ,",
    "the central los velocity dispersion @xmath98 has been calculated by using equation  ( [ los_eq ] ) .",
    "figures [ gc1 ] , [ gc2 ] and [ gc3 ] show the surface - brightness profiles ( left panels ) and velocity - dispersion profiles ( right panels ) of the newtonian and mond models of the six considered gcs . in the left panels we report also , where available , surface - brightness measures from trager , king & djorgovski ( 1995 ) .",
    "as can be noted , mond predictions significantly differ from newtonian ones : in particular , it is apparent that the _ shape _ of mond and newtonian los velocity - dispersion profiles are remarkably different .",
    "as expected , mond models predict a larger velocity dispersion along the entire cluster extent with respect to newtonian models with the same mass .",
    "the physical reason at the basis of this result is that , as showed in fig .",
    "[ pot ] , the same observed surface mass density profile is fitted by mond models with a deeper potential well and larger core radii . as a consequence , at a given radius ,",
    "the corresponding escape velocity is larger and according to equation  ( [ df_eq ] ) the width of the velocity distribution turns out to be larger .",
    "the same qualitative results have been obtained by moffat & toth  ( 2008 ) and haghi et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , who adopted different methods to calculate the velocity - dispersion profiles of the sample of gcs indicated by bgk05 .",
    "we note that the mond @xmath90 profiles of our clusters are in general decreasing functions of radius and @xmath90 goes to zero when @xmath29 approaches the truncation radius , consistent with the fact that the no stars can cross the system s boundary ( see sect .",
    "[ res_sect ] ) .",
    "an exception is the gc am1 , for which the predicted mond velocity - dispersion profile in am1 is flat along the entire cluster extent .",
    "the surface - brightness profile of this cluster is indeed well fitted by the mond isothermal sphere model ( milgrom  1984 ) corresponding to its mass .",
    "the maximum difference in the velocity dispersion predicted by mond and newtonian theories ranges from @xmath99 ( eridanus ) to @xmath100 ( ngc2419 ) , well above the accuracy currently achievable with high - resolution spectroscopic analyses .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ , > \" , ]     we have seen that , at least for the representative case of ngc2419 , while the same overall velocity dispersion can be predicted by both newtonian and mond models with different choices of the mass - to - light ratio or of the interpolating function ( compare , e.g. , model nm+ with models m1 , m2 , and mm- in table  2 ) , mond profiles can be always easily distinguished from newtonian ones .",
    "the analysis of the shape of the velocity - dispersion profile represents therefore a robust method to discriminate between the two gravity theories .",
    "this method is indeed less sensitive to the errors on the cluster mass with respect to the simple comparison between the overall cluster velocity dispersion proposed by bgk05 .",
    "moreover , the approach suggested by these authors favours low - mass gcs whose internal acceleration is lower than @xmath0 at any distance from the cluster centre .",
    "the low mass of these clusters , together with their large distances , imply a poor efficiency in measuring radial velocities for a meaningful sample of stars .",
    "of course , measuring the velocity - dispersion profile is observationally more challenging than estimating the overall velocity dispersion , but these kinds of measures are becoming feasible even for relatively distant gcs . in fig .",
    "[ par ] we overplot the three velocity - dispersion measures obtained by baumgardt et al .  ( 2009 ) from spectroscopic observations of 40 stars of ngc2419 .",
    "though there are large uncertainties due to the poor statistics , the overall trend defined by these observations appears hard to reconcile with mond , at least under the considered assumption of spherical symmetry and isotropic velocity distribution .",
    "this preliminary result confirms that ngc  2419 might be a crucial object to test mond ( as also suggested by baumgardt et al .",
    "2009 ) and strongly encourages future studies of this object combining higher resolution observations of a larger number of stars of ngc2419 as well as a systematic study of the possible effects of orbital anisotropy , rotation and deviation from spherical symmetry . among these effects ,",
    "that of orbital anisotropy is likely the most important , because the shape of the los velocity - dispersion profile can depend significantly on the distribution of stellar orbits .",
    "in particular , a radially anisotropic system is expected to have centrally steeper @xmath90 profile than an isotropic system with the same spatial distribution .",
    "therefore , it is worth investigating whether radially anisotropic mond models can be reconciled with the velocity dispersion data for ngc2419 .",
    "we address this question in the next section .      ideally , to explore the effect of orbital anisotropy on the @xmath90 profiles of gcs , one would need self - consistent anisotropic mond models derived from the distribution function .",
    "constructing such models is beyond the purpose of the present work : here we perform a preliminary analysis based on the numerical integration of the jeans equations .",
    "we follow the standard procedure ( binney & mamon  1982 ) , but with the mond gravitational field replacing the newtonian field . in practice , we take the spherically symmetric density distribution of the king model of ngc2419 ( parameters in table  1 ) , rescale it for the assumed value of @xmath101 , and compute the mond field generated by this density distribution using equation  ( [ eqmondsph ] ) .",
    "we then solve the jeans equations assuming an anisotropy - parameter profile @xmath102 , where @xmath103 and @xmath104 are the tangential and radial components of the velocity dispersion tensor .",
    "finally , we obtain the @xmath105 by deprojecting @xmath106 . for comparison",
    ", we also obtain @xmath90 profiles of anisotropic newtonian models using the same procedure .",
    "as stressed in the introduction , the jeans - equations approach does not guarantee that the obtained models are self - consistent .",
    "however , we can at least use some necessary conditions for consistency ( e.g. , ciotti & pellegrini 1992 ; an & evans 2006 ; ciotti & morganti  2009 ) to exclude unphysical @xmath107 .",
    "we note that these necessary conditions , though derived in the context of newtonian gravity , apply to our self - gravitating mond models , because each of this models can be formally interpreted as a non - self - gravitating distribution of tracer stars in the presence of a dominant mass distribution having the same gravitational potential as the mond potential of the cluster . an & evans ( 2006 ) show that a necessary condition for consistency ) .",
    "] is @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is the central logarithmic slope of the stellar density distribution . for ngc2419 @xmath110 , so models with @xmath111",
    "are inconsistent , implying that spherical , radially anisotropic models with @xmath112 independent of radius are unphysical .",
    "we then consider osipkov - merritt ( hereafter om ) models ( ospikov 1979 ; merritt 1985 ) , which are isotropic in the centre and radially anisotropic at large radii , having @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the anisotropy radius . a necessary condition for the consistency of om models is that @xmath115 is a non - increasing function of radius ( ciotti & pellegrini  1992 ) . in the considered model of ngc2419",

    "we have presented self - consistent dynamical models of stellar systems in mond that can be used to study gcs in the outer galactic regions .",

    "this indicates gcs are one of the best laboratories to test the gravity theory in the low - acceleration regime , as already suggested by various authors ( scarpa , marconi & gilmozzi 2003 ; bgk05 ; scarpa et al .",

    "2009 ) .    of course ,",
    "the same effect produced by mond on the velocity - dispersion profile can by reproduced by an @xmath118 distribution of dark matter .",
    "the presence of dark - matter halos in gcs is predicted by some theories of gc formation and evolution ( see mashchenko & sills 2005 and references therein ) and its observational evidence is still matter of debate ( moore 1996 ; forbes et al .",
    "thus , the detection of velocity - dispersion profiles in agreement with the predictions of mond would not necessarily be a problem for the dark - matter paradigm .",
    "on the other hand , it must be stressed that the detection of velocity - dispersion profiles expected on the basis of newtonian dynamics ( without dark matter ) could invalidate mond .",
    "testing mond by using nearby gcs has been already attempted by scarpa et al .",
    "( 2003 ) who found that their velocity - dispersion profiles deviate from the prediction of newtonian dynamics ( without dark matter ) at large distance from their centres .",
    "however , the nearby clusters analysed by these authors experience an external acceleration due to the milky way gravitational field that is larger than the critical acceleration @xmath119 ( bgk05 ; moffat & toth 2008 ) .",
    "bgk05 indicated a sample of eight gcs where the predictions of mond and newtonian theories on the overall los velocity dispersion significantly differ .",
    "however , the method proposed by these authors is very sensitive to the adopted mass and distance of these clusters . given the large distances and low mass of these clusters , it is very difficult to observe the significant number of cluster member stars necessary to an accurate estimate of the velocity dispersion . in this regard",
    ", the difference between the mond and newtonian predictions estimated by these authors never exceeds @xmath120 .",
    "given the best accuracy achievable by the current observing facilities ( @xmath121 ) , it is hard to reach a firm conclusion on the validity of mond using this approach .",
    "nevertheless , the first results of the application of this method to pal 14 suggests that the observed kinematic of this system might be a problem for mond ( jordi et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "a more robust test is to compare the observed shape of the velocity - dispersion profile with the prediction of newtonian and mond models ( see also moffat & toth 2008 ; haghi et al . 2009 ) .",
    "we demonstrated that this method always allows an unambiguous distinction between newtonian and mond scenarios even when large uncertainties on the cluster mass and core radii are present .",
    "the best target gc , for which this approach is expected to be particularly efficient , is ngc2419 . indeed , although not included in the list of bgk05 , this cluster is the one with the largest absolute difference in the predicted velocity - dispersion profile by newtonian and mond models .",
    "moreover , it is not significantly affected by galactic tidal effects ( gnedin & ostriker 1999 ) that can alter the shape of the velocity - dispersion profile in the outermost regions ( johnston , sigurdsson & hernquist 1999 ) and is massive enough to ensure a large number of stars at magnitudes easily reachable by the current generation of spectrographs .",
    "recently baumgardt et al .",
    "( 2009 ) measured the velocity dispersion at three different radii in this cluster .",
    "the two outermost data points are significantly lower than the velocity - dispersion profiles predicted by our isotropic mond models of ngc2419 , at least for stellar mass - to - light ratios in the range @xmath122 . only assuming quite strong radial orbital anisotropy and lower stellar mass - to - light ratio the velocity dispersion predicted by mond can be reconciled with the observed data of ngc2419 . reproducing the observed kinematics of ngc2419",
    "represents a challenge for mond , although better data sets ( larger number of stars and higher spectral resolution ) and more sophisticated modelling are needed .",
    "a limitation of the present study is that our models are spherically symmetric , non rotating and with isotropic velocity distribution .",
    "the assumption of spherical symmetry and absence of significant rotation is in general justified by the round appearance of gcs . in general , non",
    "- sphericity can be a problem in the determination of surface brightness and velocity dispersion profiles when large ellipticities are present ( perina et al .",
    "this effect should have only a minor impact in gcs which have generally symmetric density contours , at least within few core radii .",
    "the amount of anisotropy in many gcs is estimated to be relatively small ( ashurov & nuritdinov 2001 ) , though a non - negligible degree of anisotropy is likely to be present in few gcs ( meylan & heggie 1997 and references therein ) .",
    "orbital anisotropy is also predicted by n - body simulations as a result of both primordial and evolutionary reasons ( giersz 2006 ) .",
    "these effects are expected to be at least partially erased in galactic gcs by the strong tidal interaction with the milky way which removes the initial velocity anisotropies and angular momentum making them more spherical ( goodwin 1997 ) .",
    "a preliminary exploration of the effects of an extreme radial anisotropy shows a significant degeneracy between gravity law and orbital anisotropy .",
    "nevertheless , the mond and newtonian models can be distinguished when high precision data are available .",
    "another possible complication can be due to the presence of a significant fraction of unresolved binaries which can inflate the observed velocity dispersions ( cote et al .",
    "for instance , in ngc2419 the orbital velocity of a pair of equal - mass 0.8 @xmath123 stars separated by @xmath124 could be as high as 10 @xmath125 , remaining stable against collisional disruption ( hills 1984 ) . a significant fraction of binaries can therefore increase the observed velocity dispersion by few @xmath125 .",
    "this effect is particularly important in the central part of the cluster where binaries preferentially sink as a result of mass segregation .",
    "this could explain why the measured central velocity dispersion in ngc2419 seems higher than the prediction of both newtonian and mond models .",
    "note however that , in the case of ngc2419 , the `` binary - corrected '' velocity dispersion would stray even more from the prediction of mond models in the external region of the cluster . given these uncertainties , a systematic exploration of the effects on the cluster kinematics of orbital anisotropy , rotation and deviation from spherical symmetry in general would be valuable also in mond as well as in newtonian dynamics ( see bertin & varri  2008 , and references therein ) .",
