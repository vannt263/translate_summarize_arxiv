    "understanding the role played by impurities on the nature of phase transitions is of great importance , both from experimental and theoretical perspectives .",
    "first - order phase transitions are known to be dramatically softened under the presence of quenched randomness  @xcite , while continuous transitions may have their exponents altered under random fields or random bonds  @xcite .",
    "there are some very useful phenomenological arguments and some , perturbative in nature , theoretical results , pertaining to the occurrence and nature of phase transitions under the presence of quenched randomness  @xcite .",
    "historically , the most celebrated criterion is that suggested by harris  @xcite .",
    "this criterion relates directly the persistence , under random bonds , of the non random behavior to the specific heat exponent @xmath0 of the pure system . according to this criterion ,",
    "if @xmath1 , then disorder will be relevant , i.e. , under the effect of the disorder , the system will reach a new critical behavior . otherwise , if @xmath2 , disorder is irrelevant and the critical behavior will not change .",
    "pure systems with a zero specific heat exponent ( @xmath3 ) are marginal cases of the harris criterion and their study , upon the introduction of disorder , has been of particular interest  @xcite .",
    "the paradigmatic model of the marginal case is , of course , the general random 2d ising model ( random - site , random - bond , and bond - diluted ) and this model has been extensively investigated and debated [ see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ] .",
    "several recent studies , both analytical ( renormalization group and conformal field theories ) and numerical ( mainly monte carlo ( mc ) simulations ) devoted to this model , have provided very strong evidence in favor of the so - called logarithmic corrections s scenario  @xcite . according to this ,",
    "the effect of infinitesimal disorder gives rise to a marginal irrelevance of randomness and besides logarithmic corrections , the critical exponents maintain their 2d ising values .",
    "in particular , the specific heat is expected to slowly diverge with a double - logarithmic dependence of the form @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the reduced critical temperature  @xcite . here",
    ", we should mention that there is not full agreement in the literature and a different scenario , the so - called weak universality scenario  @xcite , predicts that critical quantities , such as the magnetization , zero - field susceptibility , and correlation length display power - law singularities , with the corresponding exponents @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 changing continuously with the disorder strength ; however this variation is such that the ratios @xmath9 and @xmath10 remain constant at the pure system s value .",
    "the specific heat of the disordered system is , in this case , expected to saturate , with a corresponding correlation length s exponent @xmath11  @xcite .    in general",
    ", a unitary and rigorous physical description of critical phenomena in disordered systems still lacks and certainly , lacking such a description , the study of further models for which there is a general agreement in the behavior of the corresponding pure cases is very important . in this sense ,",
    "the triangular ising ferromagnet is a further suitable candidate for testing the above predictions that has not been previously investigated in the literature .",
    "thus , our investigation will be related to the extensive relevant literature concerning the critical properties of the disordered 2d square ising model  @xcite . in particular , our discussion will focus on the main point of dispute over the last two decades , concerning the two well - known conflicting scenarios mentioned above and we will provide additional new evidence in favor of the well - established scenario of strong universality . we should note here that , the theoretically predicted scenario of strong universality has been confirmed by several mc studies on the square lattice starting from the early 90 s to nowadays [ see ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed historical review ] .    as mentioned above , it is always important to consider further models for which the critical properties of the corresponding pure versions are exactly known",
    ". this is also the case for the present model under consideration , namely the triangular ising model , called hereafter as the trim , defined as usual by the hamiltonian @xmath12 where the spin variables @xmath13 take on the values @xmath14 , @xmath15 indicates summation over all nearest - neighbor pairs of sites , and @xmath16 is the ferromagnetic exchange interaction .",
    "the trim belongs to the same universality class with the corresponding square ising model ( sqim ) , sharing the same values of critical exponents and a logarithmic behavior of the specific heat  @xcite .",
    "additionally , the critical temperature of the model and also the critical amplitude @xmath17 of ferdinand and fisher s  @xcite specific heat s logarithmic expansion [ see also the discussion in sec .  [ sec:3 ] and eq .",
    "( [ eq:7 ] ) ] are exactly known from the early work of houtappel  @xcite to be @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "nevertheless , it appears that for the trim a verification of the finite - size scaling ( fss ) properties of the model using high quality data from mc simulation is still lacking .",
    "thus , the first part of this work is devoted to the investigation of the fss behavior of the model , especially the estimation of the amplitudes and other relevant coefficients in the specific heat s logarithmic expansion and also to the estimation of the critical exponents . in this sense , the aim of this first part is twofold : first , to provide the first detailed fss analysis of the pure model and , second , to present a concrete reliability test of the proposed numerical scheme .",
    "our main focus , on the other hand , is the case with bond disorder given by the bimodal distribution @xmath20\\;;\\\\ \\nonumber & \\frac{j_{1}+j_{2}}{2}=1\\;;\\;\\;j_{1}>j_{2}>0\\;;\\;\\;r=\\frac{j_{2}}{j_{1}}\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so that @xmath21 reflects the strength of the bond randomness and we fix @xmath22 to set the temperature scale . the value of the disorder strength considered throughout this paper is @xmath23 . the resulting quenched disordered ( random - bond ) version of the hamiltonian defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) reads now as @xmath24 and will be referred in the sequel as the random - bond triangular ising model ( rbtrim ) .",
    "the corresponding random - bond sqim will be denoted hereafter respectively as rbsqim .",
    "the model on the square lattice has the advantage that the critical temperature is exactly known as a function of the disorder strength @xmath21 by duality relations  @xcite",
    ". for the rbtrim there exist only several approximations for the critical frontier of the site- and bond - diluted cases , obtained via renormalization - group techniques  @xcite and , to our knowledge , a study of the critical behavior of the model is lacking .",
    "the rest of the paper is laid out as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] we present the necessary simulation details of our numerical scheme . in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] we discuss the fss behavior of the pure model , testing with our high accuracy numerical data the exact expansion of the critical specific heat .",
    "then , in sec .  [ sec:4 ] we present a detailed fss analysis for the random version of the model , including - apart from the classical fss techniques - concepts from the scaling theory of disordered systems . our results and the relevant discussion clearly favors the scenario of strong universality in marginal disordered systems . finally , sec .",
    "[ sec:5 ] summarizes our conclusions .",
    "resorting to large scale mc simulations is often necessary  @xcite , especially for the study of the critical behavior of disordered systems .",
    "it is also well known  @xcite that for such complex systems traditional methods become very inefficient and that in the last few years several sophisticated algorithms , some of them are based on entropic iterative schemes , have been proven to be very effective .",
    "the present numerical study of the rbtrim will be carried out by applying our recent and efficient entropic scheme  @xcite . in this approach",
    "we follow a two - stage strategy of a restricted entropic sampling , which is described in our study of random - bond ising models ( rbim ) in 2d  @xcite and is very similar to the one applied also in our numerical approach to the 3d random - field ising model ( rfim )  @xcite . in these papers , we have presented in detail the various sophisticated routes used for the restriction of the energy subspace and the implementation of the wang - landau ( wl ) algorithm  @xcite .",
    "further details and an up to date implementation of this approach , especially for the study of disordered systems , is provided in our recent paper on the universality aspects of the pure and random - bond 2d blume - capel model  @xcite .",
    "we do not wish to reproduce here the details of our two - stage implementation and the practice followed in our scheme for improving accuracy by repeating the simulations .",
    "however , we should like to include a brief discussion on the approximate nature of the wl method .",
    "the usual wl recursion proceeds by modifying the density of states @xmath25 according to the rule @xmath26 and initially one chooses @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "once the accumulative energy histogram is sufficiently flat , the modification factor @xmath29 is redefined as : @xmath30 , with @xmath31 and the energy histogram reset to zero until @xmath29 is very close to unity ( i.e. @xmath32 ) . as has been reported by many authors in the study of several models ,",
    "once @xmath29 is close enough to unity , systematic deviations become negligible .",
    "disorder distribution of the susceptibility maxima of two lattices with linear sizes @xmath33 and @xmath34 of the rbtrim .",
    "the running averages over the samples is shown by the thick solid lines.,width=8 ]    however , the wl recursion violates the detailed balance from the early stages of the process and care is necessary in setting up a proper protocol of the recursion . in spite of the fact that the wl method has produced very accurate results in several models , it is fair to say that there is not a safe way to access possible systematic deviations in the general case",
    "this has been pointed out and critiqued in a recent review by janke  @xcite . for the 2d ising model ( where exact results are available for judgement )",
    "the wl method has been shown to converge very rapidly .",
    "furthermore , from our experience and especially from our recent study of the 2d rbsqim  @xcite , for which the exact phase diagram is known by duality relations , our high - level wl implementation has produced excellent results , enabling us to discriminate between competing theoretical predictions on that model . since the rbtrim is expected to have a similar `` entropy structure '' to the corresponding square model , we anticipate and it will be verified in the sequel , that , our wl scheme produces sufficiently accurate estimates enabling us , also in this case , to distinguish between competing theoretical predictions , as we have already done in the corresponding model on the square lattice .    using this scheme we performed extensive simulations for several lattice sizes in the range @xmath35 , over large ensembles @xmath36 of random realizations ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "let us note here that for the pure model we simulated for each lattice size , @xmath38 independent runs ( wl random walks ) .",
    "it is well known that , extensive disorder averaging is necessary when studying random systems , where usually broad distributions are expected leading to a strong violation of self - averaging  @xcite . a measure from the scaling theory of disordered systems ,",
    "whose limiting behavior is directly related to the issue of self - averaging  @xcite may be defined with the help of the relative variance of the sample - to - sample fluctuations of any relevant singular extensive thermodynamic property @xmath39 as follows : @xmath40_{av}-[z]^{2}_{av})/[z]^{2}_{av}$ ] .",
    "figure  [ fig:1 ] presents evidence that the above number of random realizations is sufficient in order to obtain the true average behavior and not a typical one .",
    "in particular , we plot in this figure ( for lattice sizes @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) the disorder distribution of the susceptibility maxima @xmath41 and the corresponding running average , i.e. a series of averages of different subsets of the full data set - each of which is the average of the corresponding subset of a larger set of data points , over the samples for the simulated ensemble of @xmath37 disorder realizations .",
    "a first striking observation from this figure is the existence of very large variance of the values of @xmath41 , indicating the expected violation of self - averaging for this quantity .",
    "this figure illustrates that the simulated number of random realizations is sufficient in order to probe correctly the average behavior of the system , since already for @xmath42 the average value of @xmath43 appears quite stable .",
    "closely related to the above issue of self - averaging in disordered systems is the manner of averaging over the disorder .",
    "this non - trivial process may be performed in two distinct ways when identifying the finite - size anomalies , such as the peaks of the magnetic susceptibility .",
    "the first way corresponds to the average over disorder realizations ( @xmath44_{av}$ ] ) and then taking the maxima ( @xmath44^{\\ast}_{av}$ ] ) , or taking the maxima in each individual realization first , and then taking the average ( @xmath45_{av}$ ] ) . in the present paper we have undertaken our fss analysis using both ways of averaging and have found comparable results for the values of the critical exponents , as will be discussed in more detail below .",
    "closing this brief outline , let us comment on the statistical errors of our numerical data .",
    "the statistical errors of our wl scheme on the observed average behavior , were found to be of relatively small magnitude ( of the order of the symbol sizes ) when compared to the relevant disorder - sampling errors ( due to the finite number of simulated realizations ) .",
    "thus , the error bars in most of our figures below concerning the average @xmath44^{\\ast}_{av}$ ] and used also in the corresponding fitting attempts , reflect the disorder - sampling errors and have been estimated using groups of @xmath46 realizations via the jackknife method  @xcite . on the other hand for the case @xmath45_{av}$ ]",
    "the error bars shown reflect the sample - to - sample fluctuations .",
    "in this section we proceed to investigate the critical behavior of the pure trim defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) .",
    "our aim is to observe the exact critical behavior of the model and also to estimate the whole set of critical exponents , paying particular attention to the fss behavior of the critical specific heat . as mentioned above , the numerical data shown below in figs .",

    "for the square lattice , it was shown in 1969 in the pioneering work of ferdinand and fisher  @xcite that close to the critical point the specific heat obeys the following fss expansion @xmath63 where the value of the critical amplitude @xmath17 is @xmath64 . as pointed out in ref .",
