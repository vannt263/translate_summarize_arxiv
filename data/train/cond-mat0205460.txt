    "one of the most active areas in condensed matter physics is the search for new methods to treat chemically disordered and correlated systems . in these systems , especially in three dimensions or higher , approximations which neglect long ranged correlations are generally thought to provide a reasonable first approximation for many properties .",
    "perhaps the most successful of these methods are the coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) @xcite and the dynamical mean field approximation ( dmfa ) @xcite , for disordered and correlated systems , respectively .",
    "although these approximations have different origins , they are formally related .",
    "both are single site theories where non - local effects of disorder and correlations are treated in a mean field approximation .",
    "diagrammatically , both the dmfa @xcite and the cpa @xcite may be defined as theories which completely neglect momentum conservation at all internal vertices .",
    "when this principle is applied , the diagrammatic expansion for the irreducible quantities in each approximation collapses onto that of a self - consistently embedded impurity problem .",
    "many researchers have actively searched for a technique to restore non - local corrections to these approaches . here",
    ", we discuss just two approaches which are fully causal and self - consistent : the molecular coherent potential approximation ( mca ) @xcite and the dynamical cluster approximation ( dca ) @xcite .",
    "recently the cellular dynamical mean field approach @xcite was proposed for ordered correlated systems , while the molecular coherent potential approximation has traditionally been applied to disordered systems .",
    "since both methods share a common microscopic definition we use the term mca to refer to both techniques in the following .",
    "while the mca is traditionally defined in the real space of the lattice , the dca is traditionally defined in its reciprocal space . in the mca ,",
    "the system lattice is split into a series of identical molecules .",
    "interactions between the molecules are treated in a mean - field approximation , while interactions within the molecule are explicitly accounted for . in the dca , the reciprocal space of the lattice",
    "is split into cells , and momentum conservation is neglected for momentum transfers within each cell while it is ( partially ) conserved for transfers between the cells .",
    "these approximations share many features in common : they both map the lattice problem onto that of a self - consistently embedded cluster problem .",
    "both recover the single site approximation ( cpa or dmfa ) when the cluster size reduces to one and become exact as the cluster size diverges .",
    "both are fully causal @xcite , and provided that the clusters are chosen correctly @xcite , they maintain the point group symmetry of the original lattice problem . here , we provide a microscopic diagrammatic derivation of both the mca and the dca , and explore their convergence with increasing cluster size .",
    "we will employ a diagrammatic formalism to derive the mca and dca , assuming that a collection of electrons on a lattice , with green function @xmath4 interact through an interaction @xmath5 .      since our object is to define cluster methods",
    ", we divide the original lattice of @xmath6 sites into @xmath7 clusters ( molecules ) , each composed of @xmath8 sites , where @xmath9 is the dimensionality .",
    "@xmath3 need not be an integer , for example in a two - dimensional square lattice , a diamond cluster with @xmath10 will have @xmath11 .",
    "however , care must be taken so that the clusters preserve the point group symmetry of the original lattice .",
    "we use the coordinate @xmath12 to label the origin of the clusters and @xmath13 to label the @xmath14 sites within a cluster , so that the site indices of the original lattice @xmath15 .",
    "the points @xmath12 form a lattice with a reciprocal space labeled by @xmath16 . the reciprocal space corresponding to the sites @xmath13 within a cluster shall be labeled @xmath17 , with @xmath18 and integer @xmath19 . then @xmath20 .",
    "note that @xmath21 since a component of @xmath12 must take the form @xmath22 with integer @xmath23 .",
    "the formal mapping between the full lattice problem and the cluster is accomplished by relaxing the condition of momentum conservation at the internal vertices of the compact diagrams .",
    "momentum conservation at each vertex is described by the laue function @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) are the momenta entering ( leaving ) the vertex .",
    "mller - hartmann @xcite showed that the dynamical mean field ( dmf ) theory may be derived by completely ignoring momentum conservation at each internal vertex by setting @xmath29 .",
    "then , one may freely sum over all of the internal momentum labels , and the graphs for the generating functional @xmath0 and its irreducible derivatives , contain only local propagators and interactions .",
    "the dca and mca techniques may also be defined by their respective laue functions . in the mca , we approximate the laue function by @xmath30 thus , the mca omits the phase factors @xmath31 resulting from the position of the cluster in the original lattice but retains the ( far less important ) phase factors @xmath32 associated with the position within a cluster . in the dca",
    "we also omit the phase factors @xmath32 , so that @xmath33 both the mca and dca laue functions recover the exact result when @xmath34 and the dmfa result , @xmath35 , when @xmath36 .    if we apply the mca laue function eq .",

    "therefore the compact non - local correction falls as @xmath63 and is very short - ranged ; whereas , the non - compact correction remains of order one , regardless of how far site @xmath57 is from the origin @xcite .",
    "as we will see below , the essential approximation of the dca and the mca is to use the cluster propagators , which are accurate only for short distances , to construct various diagrammatic insertions . in high dimensions , or in finite dimensions when the green functions fall exponentially with distance , this is a good approximation for the compact graphs which comprise @xmath0 , but a poor approximation for the non - compact graphs @xcite .",

    "thus far , we have shown that the dca converges more quickly than the mca for critical properties and for extended cluster quantities ( e.g.  the cluster susceptibility ) .",

    "we show that they are @xmath0-derivable , and that the lattice free energy is optimized by equating the irreducible quantities on the lattice to those on the cluster .",
    "the mca maps the lattice to a cluster with open boundaries and consequently , the cluster violates translational invariance .",
    "in contrast , the dca cluster has periodic boundary conditions , and therefore preserves the translational invariance of the lattice .",
    "these differences in the boundary conditions translate directly to different asymptotic behaviors for large clusters @xmath14 . as we find analytically as well as numerically , the surface contributions in the mca lead to an average hybridization @xmath94 of the cluster to the mean field that scales like @xmath139 as compared to the @xmath140 scaling of the dca .",
    "since @xmath94 acts as the small parameter for these approximation schemes , the dca converges much more quickly than the mca .",
    "these effects are more pronounced near a transition , where the large surface contribution of the mca stabilizes the mean - field character of the transition .",
    "consequently , the dca result for the transition temperature @xmath105 of the 1d symmetric fkm model scales almost like @xmath133 to the exact result @xmath123 , whereas the mca result converges very slowly",
    ". the boundary conditions also differ in that only the mca sites at the surface of the cluster couple to the mean field ; whereas , all dca cluster sites have an equal coupling to the mean field host . as a result local quantities , such as the density of states , when measured on the central sites of the mca cluster converge more quickly than than corresponding dca results .    thus , for critical properties and extended cluster quantities , the dca converges far more quickly than the mca ; whereas for local quantities which may be measured at the central sites of the mca cluster , the mca converges more quickly . since the origin of these differences lies in the different boundary conditions we expect them to hold generally for any model of electrons moving on a lattice .
