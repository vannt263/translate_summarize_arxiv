    "the scale - dependence of mass - to - light @xmath0 ratio is always an important topic of cosmology .",
    "the @xmath0 ratio on scales of galaxies , double galaxies , groups of galaxies , and galaxy clusters provided the first approach of evaluating the mean mass density of the universe ( e.g. faber & gallagher 1979 ) . a most striking result in this study",
    "is that @xmath0 ratio increases with the scale of the system considered ( e.g. rubin 1993 ) .",
    "this has inspired the searching for dark matters in objects on scales larger than clusters . yet , the @xmath0 ratio appears to be flat on the scales of rich clusters and larger . this result has been employed to propose that the @xmath0 ratio on scales larger than clusters asymptotically reaches a constant , which is approximately equal to the median @xmath0 ratio of rich clusters , i.e. @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5 ( bahcall , lubin & dorman 1995 ) .",
    "this asymptotic @xmath0 ratio yields @xmath6 , suggesting a low density universe ( bahcall & fan 1998 ) .",
    "that is , the behavior of @xmath0 ratio on large scales is directly related to the cosmological parameter @xmath7 .",
    "the evidence for a flat @xmath0 on large scale is still weak .",
    "the observed virgo cluster infall motion seems to be the only evidence of the flatness on the scale of the local supercluster ( @xmath8 10 @xmath2 mpc ) ( e.g. yahil , sandage & tammann , 1980 ) .",
    "however , a direct measure of the mass - to - light ratio of the corona borealis supercluster gives @xmath9 .",
    "namely , the @xmath0 ratio on scale @xmath8 20 @xmath2 mpc is higher than that of rich clusters by a factor of 2 ( small et al . 1998 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "galaxy clusters with abell radius generally are dominated by elliptical galaxies at their centers , while larger structures have a higher fraction of spiral galaxies .",
    "therefore , it is uncertain if the morphological segregation leads to a variation of the @xmath0 ratio of structures larger than clusters .    in this _",
    ", we try to approach this problem by analyzing the observed scaling of clustering on scales beyond clusters .",
    "we have found recently that the richness function ( rf ) and the mass function ( mf ) of objects identified by multi - resolution analysis are scale invariant from the abell radius to about 20 @xmath2 mpc ( xu , fang and wu 1998 , hereafter xfw ) .",
    "we will show that the scale dependence of @xmath0 ratio is completely determined by the scaling factors of rf and mf of these multi - scale identified objects . if the mass field traced by the observed galaxies can match with popular models of cdm cosmogony",
    ", one can calculate the @xmath0 s scale dependence by comparing the observed rf scaling with the model - predicted mf scaling . using the data of the iras 1.2 jy galaxy survey",
    ", we find that the @xmath0 ratio is approximately flat on scales up to , at least , 24 @xmath2 mpc .",
    "in  2 we calculate the mass functions of multi - scale identified clusters from simulation and calculate their scaling indices . in  3 we derive the richness functions and their scaling indices of multi - scale identified clusters from iras 1.2 jy galaxy survey . in  4 we study the scale dependence of mass - to - light ratio by matching the scaling behaviors of theoretical mass functions with those of observational richness functions .",
    " 5 is our conclusion .",
    "the model samples of mass distribution used in this paper are similar to xfw .",
    "they are generated by n - body simulations with the p@xmath10 m code developed by y.p .",
    "jing ( jing & fang 1994 ) .",
    "three popular models of the cdm cosmogony , i.e. the standard cdm ( scdm ) , the flat low - density cdm ( lcdm ) models and the open cdm model ( ocdm ) , are employed .",
    "the hubble constant @xmath4 ( @xmath11 km / sec / mpc ) ) , mass density @xmath12 , cosmological constant @xmath13 and the normalization of the power spectrum of the density perturbation @xmath14 are chosen to be ( 0.5 , 1.0 , 0.0 , 0.62 ) for scdm , ( 0.75 , 0.3 , 0.7 , 1.0 ) for lcdm , and ( 0.75 , 0.3 , 0.0 , 1.0 ) for ocdm . the simulation parameters are : 1 . )",
    "box size @xmath15 mpc ; 2 . ) number of simulation particles @xmath16 ; and 3 . ) the effective force resolution @xmath17 mpc . in this case , each particle has a mass of @xmath18 , which is small enough to resolve reliably objects with mass @xmath19.we produce 8 realizations for each model .    for the simulation results ,",
    "the clusters on scale @xmath1 and with mass larger than @xmath20 are identified by the multi - resolution ( or multi - scale ) analysis based on discrete wavelet transformation ( dwt ) ( fang & thews 1998 ) .",
    "it has been shown that the dwt - identified clusters on the abell scale , i.e. @xmath21-clusters , are the same as those given by _",
    "friends - of - friends _ ( fof ) identification ( xfw ; jing & fang 1994 ) . that is , in terms of the @xmath21-cluster identification , the dwt method is as good as the fof .",
    "thus , the dwt method can be reliably used to systematically identify objects on scales @xmath22 ( xu , fang & deng 1999 ) .    with the multi - scale identification of simulation samples ,",
    "we have model - predicted the mass function of @xmath1-clusters , @xmath23 , which is the number density of @xmath1-clusters with masses larger than @xmath20 .",
    "the mfs of @xmath1-clusters with @xmath24 , 3 , 6 , 12 and 24 @xmath2 mpc in models of the scdm , lcdm and ocdm are shown in fig .",
    "the middle part of mass function , roughly in the range @xmath25 @xmath26 mpc@xmath27 , is more reliable , as all the poisson errors are relatively small .",
    "it can be seen from fig .",
    "1 that all the mfs have a similar shape .",
    "this is because of the mf scale invariance ( xfw ) as @xmath28 where the scaling factor @xmath29 is only a function of the ratio @xmath30 , but independent of @xmath20 .",
    "obviously @xmath31 when @xmath32 .",
    "the scaling factor @xmath33 is an important statistic description of clustering on large scales .",
    "we apply the dwt multi - resolution identification to the redshift survey of the infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ) galaxies with flux limit of @xmath34 ( fisher et al .",
    "the iras sample is of 2 ( physical space ) + 1 ( redshift space ) dimension .",
    "a dwt algorithm for identifying @xmath1-clusters from the 2 + 1 dimension samples has been developed ( xfw ; xu , fang & deng 1999 ) . to minimize the radial effects",
    ", the data are divided into redshift intervals of @xmath35 $ ] , @xmath36 $ ] and @xmath37 $ ] km s@xmath38 .",
    "we then identify @xmath1-clusters in each interval on scales @xmath39 and",
    "@xmath40 @xmath2 mpc .",
    "the sampling rate of the iras sample is low .",
    "the iras clusters identified on abell scale @xmath21 contain much fewer galaxies than optical clusters , and iras galaxies do not populate the clusters in the same manner as optical galaxies ( fisher et al .",
    "1995 ; webster , lahav & fisher 1997 ) .",
    "this gives rise to higher poisson errors .",
    "however , if we are interested in clusters larger than the abell scale , this problem would be softened as structures contain more member galaxies . meanwhile , iras galaxies are mostly of late - type .",
    "it traces clusters on various scales @xmath1 uniformly .",
    "therefore , the samples of iras @xmath1-clusters may be less affected by morphological segregation , and good for studying the scale - dependence of structures .    with the identified @xmath1-clusters of iras galaxies",
    ", one can find the richness function of iras @xmath1-clusters , @xmath41 , which is the number density of @xmath1-clusters containing @xmath42 members of iras galaxies in the redshift shell @xmath43 .",
    "the rfs of @xmath1-clusters with @xmath24 , 3 , 6 , 12 and 24 @xmath2 mpc are shown in fig .",
    "2 , in which the errors are poissonian ( xu , fang & deng 1999 ) . despite the errors are large , it is clear that the shapes of all the rfs are basically the same . this feature can be described as a rf scaling invariance in each @xmath43 shell , @xmath44 the scaling factor @xmath45 is a function of the scale ratio @xmath30 , but independent of @xmath46 .",
    "obviously @xmath47 when @xmath48 .",
    "the scaling factor @xmath49 of iras @xmath1-clusters as a function of @xmath30 is presented in fig .",
    "it shows that @xmath49 is also independent of @xmath43 within the 1-@xmath50 error bars .",
    "by definition , the mass - to - luminosity ratio for iras @xmath1-clusters is the ratio between mass and luminosity of @xmath1-clusters .",
    "one can introduce the @xmath0 ratio of the iras @xmath1-clusters by a mass - number relation as @xmath51 where @xmath20 is the total mass of a @xmath1-cluster , and @xmath52 the total number of member galaxies of the @xmath1-cluster , defined by @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the selection function ( fisher et al .",
    "the definition of @xmath55 by eq.(3 ) has implicitly assumed that @xmath55 , or the @xmath0 ratio , is independent of the mass of the objects , since the @xmath0 ratio of @xmath21-clusters is found to be mass - independent on average ( bahcall & cen 1993 ) .",
    "such independence may be caused by the fact that the scale of luminosity - related hydrodynamical process are smaller than that of clusters .",
    "thus , luminosity functions and @xmath0 ratios are statistically independent of environment on cluster scale",
    ". therefore , it would be reasonable to assume that the mass - independence of the @xmath0 ratio still hold on scales larger than clusters .",
    "the number - mass conversion coefficient @xmath55 is proportional to the mass - to - light ratio @xmath56 for iras galaxies on scale @xmath1 .",
    "we have then @xmath57    using eqs . ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) , one can find the mass function of iras @xmath1-clusters @xmath58 as @xmath59 therefore , the rf scaling ( 2 ) will further yield a mf scaling of iras @xmath1-clusters as @xmath60 where the mf scaling factor @xmath61 is given by @xmath62 or @xmath63 namely , the scale - dependence of the @xmath0 ratio is completely determined by the ratio between the mf and rf scaling factors of the iras @xmath1-clusters .",
    "however , despite that we have the observed scaling factor @xmath45 , we are in lack of the observed @xmath64 .",
    "this problem can be overcome by matching the iras galaxy traced mass field with popular models of cdm cosmogony . with properly selected parameters ,",
    "cdm cosmogony models have been found to provide good approximation to many observational properties of large scale structures , especially the mass function of optical and x - ray clusters ( e.g. jing & fang 1994 ; bahcall , fan & cen 1997 , and references therein ) . on the other hand ,",
    "some individual clusters and superclusters from optical surveys have been identified from the iras data ( fisher et al .",
    "1995 ; webster et al .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to assume that the mass field of cdm cosmogony model provides a description for the mass field traced by the iras galaxies .",
    "thus , the statistical properties of the simulated @xmath1-clusters should be the same as that of the iras @xmath21-clusters .",
    "we have then @xmath65 i.e. the scaling factors of @xmath23 and @xmath66 are the same .",
    "using eqs .",
    "( 9 ) and ( 10 ) we have @xmath67 thus , the @xmath56 ratio can be determined by the ratio between the model - predicted @xmath29 and the observed @xmath45 .",
    "the ratio @xmath68 as a function of @xmath30 is plotted in fig .",
    "4 . for lcdm and ocdm ,",
    "the value of this ratio does not depart from 1 with a significance larger than 1-@xmath50 in the entire range of scales from 3 to 24 @xmath2 mpc . in the case of scdm , only at @xmath69 24 @xmath2 mpc , the ratio shows a difference from 1 with 2 @xmath50 level .",
    "particularly , in the redshift shell [ 2500,5000 ] km s@xmath38 , the ratio is very flat for all the three models .",
    "thus , for iras sample , the @xmath0 ratio is basically flat on large scales from 3 to 24 @xmath2 mpc , i.e. @xmath70 this result is _ weakly _ dependent on specific parameters of models of the cdm cosmogony .",
    "the @xmath71 goodness is larger than 98% for all the three cdm models .    nevertheless , in fig .",
    "4 , we can see a slight , but systematic increase of @xmath0 with scale .",
    "a linear fitting by @xmath72 yields @xmath71 goodness larger than 99.9% for all the three models .",
    "the least - square fitted slope @xmath73 is found to be @xmath74 for ocdm , @xmath75 for lcdm , and @xmath76 for scdm .",
    "that is , the @xmath0 ratio on scale @xmath77 mpc is probably larger than that of @xmath21 by a factor about 1.7 for lcdm and ocdm .",
    "( or , a factor of 2.9 for scdm . ) these results for ocdm and lcdm are consistent with the @xmath0 ratio measurement of the corona borealis supercluster .",
    "namely , @xmath0 scale - dependence given by iras galaxies is consistent with optical data .",
    "the rf scaling factor of multi - scale identified @xmath1-clusters is fundamentally important as a statistical measure for clustering on scales larger than clusters . since these rfs depend only on the number of member galaxies of @xmath1-clusters , they can be directly detected from a galaxy redshift survey regardless the mass determination of individual objects .",
    "the @xmath0 ratio of gravitationally clustering systems which consist of luminous objects and dark matter depends only on the scale of the system but not on total mass ( bahcall and cen 1993 ) .",
    "this is actually a scaling of cosmic gravitationally clustering .",
    "therefore , the scale dependence of @xmath0 ratio is closely related to other scaling indices of these objects .",
    "we have shown that the scale behavior of @xmath0 is determined by the rf and mf scaling factors of @xmath1-clusters .    by comparing the mass function scaling of simulated samples with the richness function scaling of iras 1.2 jy galaxies ,",
    "we conclude that the assumption of @xmath0-flatness is basically correct in the range from 1.5 to 24 @xmath2 mpc .",
    "this conclusion is weakly dependent on the cosmological parameters we have considered ."
