    "because of the existence of an attractive interaction in the anti - triplet quark - quark channel in qcd , the cold and dense quark matter has been believed to favor the formation of diquark condensate and being in the superconducting phase @xcite-@xcite .    the qcd phase structure at high baryon density",
