    "a motivation of the present study , lies on the expected similarity between the phase diagram of bi2201 @xcite and their parents high-@xmath15 superconductors , as bi2212 ( which displays the pseudo - gap @xcite ) , for which one can only study the linear part ( near @xmath15 ) of the phase diagram with magnetic fields commonly available in laboratories .",

    "@xcite which studied fluctuation conductivity . results of these works for the optimal doping sample with @xmath16 and @xmath17  k , produced quite different values for @xmath12 , and for @xmath18 as well .",
    "for instance , values of @xmath19  koe and @xmath20  koe / k were found in ref .",

    "@xcite for the same quantities on a similar sample with same field orientation . regarding the anisotropy , a @xmath21 were found in refs . @xcite and @xcite while a much higher value @xmath22 was found in ref .",
    ". the common point of all these works is the existence of an upward curvature in the @xmath23 phase diagram .",
    "this upward curvature in the phase diagram , which might be related to the criterion used to extract the values of @xmath24 or @xmath7 from resistivity curves , are claimed to be possibly related to an intrinsic granularity of the bi2201 system , as observed in overdoped tl-2201 system.@xcite moreover , the upward curvature of the critical field in the phase diagram , have been also observed in other high-@xmath15 systems @xcite , as for instance in la - bi2201 with the critical field being extracted from specific heat measurements @xcite .",
    "discussions regarding the critical field , as extracted from resisitivity curves , to be related with the onset of phase coherence @xcite point to the need of further studies in these systems .    in this work ,",
    "we address the above issue , by performing precise magnetisation measurements in a bi2201 single crystal .",
    "the magnetic phase diagram of the bi2201 studied sample is obtained through a critical scaling analysis of many isofield magnetisation curves . the resulting mean field phase diagram",
    "do not show any upward curvature , but an analysis of @xmath5 curves near the transition , considering deviations from the linear behavior of magnetisation with temperature due to phase fluctuations , produced values of an apparent temperature transition , @xmath11 which represents the onset of phase correlations .",
    "values of @xmath11 lies above @xmath7 , but below @xmath15 , and show an upward curvature and a much higher value of the apparent @xmath18 .",
    "the resulting mean field phase diagram shows a @xmath25  koe / k , and a @xmath26  koe , which reasonable agree with values obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite for a sample with similar @xmath15 and same field orientation .",
    "the value of @xmath27  koe , estimated from the whh formula@xcite , @xmath28 , is twice the value suggested by the phase diagram .",
    "we also observe that a 30  koe field suppresses any signal of superconductivity above 3  k ( the lowest temperature in this work ) , allowing to obtain the temperature dependence of the normal state magnetisation .",
    "the studied single crystal of bi2201 has a mass of 7 mg and approximate dimensions of @xmath29 .",
    "the single crystal shows a fully developed superconducting transition at @xmath17  k with @xmath30 k. the crystal was grown by a travelling - solvent - floating - zone method described in ref .",
    "the magnetization measurements were carried out by using a cryogenics magnetometer system based on a superconducting quantum interference device , built with a 60 koe superconducting magnet with a low - field feature .",
    "we only obtained measurements for the direction @xmath4-axis .",
    "all data were obtained after a desired magnetic field was applied without overshooting and magnetization data were collected by heating the sample with fixed @xmath31 k increments from 3 k up to temperatures well above @xmath15 producing a isofield zero - field - cooling ( zfc ) @xmath5 curve .",
    "after that the sample was again cooled to 3 k , in the applied magnetic field , and another set of data was collected while heating the sample from 3 k to above @xmath15 , producing a isofield field - cooling ( fc ) @xmath5 curve .",
    "this procedure allows for determination of the reversible regime of each isofield @xmath32 curve .",
    "few isothermic @xmath33 curves were also obtained which exhibit a pronounced fish - tail ( second magnetization peak ) . as mentioned , the suppression of superconductivity observed with a 30 koe field allowed to obtain the precise form of the normal state magnetisation , @xmath34= @xmath35 .",
    "the background magnetisation was then corrected for each @xmath5 curve after selecting and fitting a wide region above @xmath15 to the form @xmath35 , where @xmath36 , @xmath37 is small , positive for low fields , decreases as field increases changing signal for higher fields , and @xmath38 .",
    "figure 1 shows all measured zfc @xmath5 curves obtained after the proper background correction .",
    "the arrows in fig . 1 show the positions at which the zfc and fc curves separate ( producing a kind of hump ) as @xmath39 is lowered below the irreversibility temperature , @xmath40 , which is only observed for fields @xmath41 koe .",
    "all curves obtained for fields above 1 koe show only reversible regime above 3 k. the inset of fig .",
    "1 shows selected @xmath5 curves as measured , evidencing the behavior of the @xmath5 curve for @xmath42 koe ( for which no superconductivity signal is detected ) and as measured for @xmath43 koe , both exhibiting the same normal state behavior which are well fitted to the form @xmath35 .",
    "this inset also shows the resulting magnetisation curve for @xmath43 koe obtained after subtraction of the normal state magnetisation extrapolated to the lower temperature region . for this particular curve ( @xmath43 koe ) , the normal state region was obtained by fitting the data above @xmath39 = 10 k , which produced the best fit .",
    "we mention that there is no visible changes in the resulting magnetisation after using data above 12 k in the fitting . for all curves we used the same criterium , by selecting the normal state region that produced the best fit .",
    "it should be mentioned that a similar normal state background with a small linear temperature dependence term was previously observed in bi2201 nanocristaline - phase @xcite . as shown in the curves of fig .  1",
    ", the resulting isofield @xmath5 curves show a large reversible region displaying a linear region with @xmath39 , followed by a pronounced rounding effect as magnetization approaches zero , which is reminiscent of superconducting fluctuations in the vicinity of @xmath7 in high-@xmath15 superconductors.@xcite it is also possible to see in fig .",

    "figure 2a shows details of the reversible region of selected @xmath5 curves , where in this figure , it is plotted both , the zfc and fc data .",

    "2a that the extrapolation of the linear region of each curve to @xmath45 , which method@xcite is commonly used to estimate the mean field temperature transition , @xmath7 , produces inconsistent values of @xmath7 , which values even increase with field .",
    "deviations from the linear behavior of @xmath5 curves near @xmath7 are examined by studying the asymptotic behavior@xcite of @xmath46@xmath47 , where @xmath9 is an exponent ( which mean field value is @xmath48 @xcite ) and @xmath11 an apparent temperature transition .",
    "the approach is based on the fact that the magnetisation in the abrikosov approximation , near @xmath7 , is given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the superconducting order parameter.@xcite it follows that near @xmath7 , @xmath51^m$ ] where @xmath52 for @xmath53-wave bcs superconductors @xcite .",

    "results of this analysis are shown in fig .",
    "2b for selected @xmath5 curves .",
    "resulting values of @xmath10 decrease as field increases , but , as will be seen , lies above @xmath7 .",
    "resulting values of the exponent @xmath9 deviates considerably from the expected mean field value , @xmath48 , which suggests the existence of phase fluctuations @xcite ( as discussed below ) , which extends phase correlations above @xmath7 up to @xmath11 .",
    "the resulting values of @xmath11 will be plotted below in a phase diagram of the studied sample .",
    "it is worth to mention that deviations from the mean field exponent value , 1/2 , are expected for order parameters with @xmath55-wave symmetry ( as is the case for cuprates ) , for which phase and amplitude fluctuations are predicted to have distinct contributions at the node and anti - node @xcite .",
    "it is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that in that case ( the existence of a node in the order parameter ) the effect of phase fluctuations is to reduce the density of states changing the shape of the gap near @xmath7 , and consequently the value of the exponent @xmath9 . within this scenarios",
    ", @xmath11 represents the onset of phase correlations which may occur above @xmath7 .",
    "it is important to mention that the possible existence of a pseudo - gap phase above @xmath15 in bi2201 would make one to expect values of @xmath11 lying above @xmath15 @xcite , as for instance observed in deoxygenated yba@xmath56cu@xmath57o@xmath58 and bi2212 ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite ) , which is not the case here since the @xmath11 line lies below @xmath15 . this fact does not rule out the existence of a pseudo - gap above @xmath15 in the studied system , but with no phase correlations .",
    "it should mentioned that , due to the similarities between bi2201 and bi2212 , the superconducting fluctuations observed here , could be explained in terms of uncorrelated pairs existing above @xmath15 due to charge inhomogeneity , as observed in bi2212 within the pseudo - gap region @xcite .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "2a shows a selected @xmath33 curve obtained at 3 k , where it is possible to identify a meissner region up to 3 oe , and the field @xmath59 above which a pronounced second magnetisation peak sets in .",

    "it was suggested that the vanishing of fluctuation effects at these high @xmath80 or @xmath97 values is related to the shrinkage of the superconducting coherence length to its minimum possible length , the cooper pairs size @xmath98 , and that should be accounted for by the introduction of a total - energy cutoff in the fluctuations spectrum @xcite . in presence of large @xmath80 values",

    "@xcite vortex fluctuations are expected for low magnetic fields within the london region , while , for high fields amplitude fluctuations dominate , explaining why the curves with 20 and 25 koe do not cross the same point ( see fig .",
