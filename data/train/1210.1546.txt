    "from the outset , inspired by gas physics , plasma physicists derived kinetic equations to describe microscopic aspects of their physics , in particular the vlasov equation .",
    "this trend has been the dominant one till nowadays .",
    "however , for plasmas where transport due to short range interactions (  collisions \" ) is weak , it is possible to work directly with @xmath0-body classical mechanics . as will be recalled in section [ wpdrt ] , this approach led to a new description of wave - particle interaction making it more intuitive and unifying particle and wave evolutions , as well as collective and finite-@xmath0 physics .",
    "this paper develops this approach further by deriving a rigorous fundamental equation for the electrostatic potential ( section [ fep ] ) , which is extended to enable a correct description of trapping or chaos due to langmuir waves ( section [ wpdrt ] ) .",
    "it brings further unifications : debye shielding ( or screening ) and landau theory of linear waves ( section [ dsld ] ) , landau growth or damping and spontaneous emission ( section [ wpdrt ] ) , debye shielding and collisional transport ( section [ dsct ] ) .",
    "these results come with a considerable simplification of the mathematical framework with respect to textbooks ( see for instance refs .",
    "@xcite ) , and with new insights into microscopic plasma physics . in particular",
    "it solves the following issue : how can each particle be shielded by all other ones , while all the plasma particles are in uninterrupted motion ?",
    "this turns out to be a mere consequence of the almost independent deflections of particles due to the coulomb force .",
    "furthermore , the new path to landau damping goes first through debye shielding , a totally unexpected fact , since classical textbooks present these concepts in different and unrelated chapters .    as to collisional transport , this paper does not simply recover the classical result presented in textbooks , but it provides the first calculation of this transport without any ad hoc cut - off .",
    "this is made possible by a mechanical calculation of the deflection of a particle which covers the scales corresponding to the debye length , to the inter - particle distance , and to the distance of minimum approach of two electrons in a rutherford collision . till now none of the papers about collisional transport , and no textbook , was able to correctly describe the scale of the inter - particle distance .",
    "the derivations are elementary ( we refrain from invoking the liouville equation or the bbgky hierarchy ) . after section [ fep ] ,",
    "the successive approximations of the fundamental equation ( [ phihat ] ) enable to get rid of the heavy notations related to its generality .",
    "these approximations involve linearization in sections [ fep ] , [ scp ] , and [ stsp ] , but section [ miids ] , the beginning of section [ wpdrt ] , and section [ dsct ] do not appeal to linearization . for the sake of brevity ,",
    "this paper is more oriented toward concepts and intuitive physics , than toward ready - to - use formulas to be presented elsewhere .",
    "here are the main results of this paper :    \\1 . by using the fourier and laplace transforms , a rigorous equation ( eq .  ( [ phihat ] ) )",
    "is derived for the electrostatic potential of an infinite plasma made up of the periodic replication of @xmath0 electrons coupled by coulomb forces in a volume @xmath1 with a neutralizing ionic background ( one component plasma ( ocp ) model @xcite ) .",
    "this equation is of the type @xmath2 source term , where @xmath3 is a linear operator , acting on the infinite dimensional array @xmath4 whose components are all the fourier - laplace components of the potential .",
    "considering that particle trajectories stay close to ballistic , and replacing inside @xmath3 the discrete sums over particles by integrals over a smooth distribution function , the potential turns out to be the sum of the shielded coulomb potentials of the individual particles ( eq .  ( [ phi ] ) ) .",
    "such potentials were first computed by a kinetic approach in section ii.a of ref .",
    "@xcite and later on in @xcite .",
    "\\3 . replacing the discrete sums over particles of their shielded potentials by integrals over a smooth distribution function ,",
    "yields the classical vlasovian expression ( eqs  ( [ phihatl ] ) and ( [ phi0hatcg ] ) ) including initial conditions in landau contour calculations of langmuir wave growth or damping , obtained by linearizing vlasov equation and using fourier - laplace transform , as described in many textbooks ( see for instance refs .",
    "@xcite ) . therefore in these calculations , the electrostatic potential turns out to be the smoothed version of the actual shielded potential in the plasma .",
    "\\4 . in the spirit of refs .",
    "@xcite , in order to accommodate a correct description of trapping or chaos due to langmuir waves , the set of particles is split into bulk and tail , where the bulk is the set of particles which can not resonate with langmuir waves . repeating the analysis leading to eq .",
    "( [ phihat ] ) for the bulk particles , the same equation is recovered with an additional source term due to the tail particles ( eq .  ( [ phihatu ] ) ) .",
    "\\5 . using the fact that the number of tail particles is small with respect to the bulk one , and a technique introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite , an amplitude equation is derived for any fourier component of the potential where tail particles provide a source term ( eq .  ( [ eqampl ] ) ) .    \\6 . this equation , together with the equation of motion of the tail particles , enables to show that , in the linear regime , the amplitude of a langmuir wave is ruled by landau growth or damping , and by spontaneous emission ( eq .  ( [ evampfinal ] ) ) , a generalization to 3 dimensions of a one - dimensional result of refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "\\7 . using the shielded potential , the collisional diffusion coefficient @xmath5 of a given particle",
    "is computed by a convergent expression including the particle deflections for all impact parameters .",
    "these deflections are computed by first order perturbation theory in the total electric field , except for those due to close encounters . the contribution to @xmath5 of the former ones",
    "is matched with that of the latter ones provided by ref .",
    "the detailed matching procedure includes the scale of the inter - particle distance , and is reminiscent of that in @xcite , without invoking the cancellation of three infinite integrals .",
    "@xmath5 has the same expression as that in ref .",
    "@xcite , except for the coulomb logarithm which is modified by a velocity dependent quantity of order 1 .",
    "picard iteration technique is applied to the equation of motion of particle @xmath6 due to the coulomb forces of all other ones .",
    "it reveals that a part of the effect on particle @xmath6 of another particle @xmath7 is mediated by all other particles ( eq .  ( [ rsecnaccdev2 ] ) ) .",
    "indeed particle @xmath7 modifies the position of all other particles , implying that the action of the latter ones on particle @xmath6 is modified by particle @xmath7 .",
    "this calculation yields the following interpretation of shielding . at @xmath8",
    "consider a set of randomly distributed particles , and especially particle @xmath6 . at a later time",
    "@xmath9 , the latter has deflected all particles which made a closest approach to it with an impact parameter @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the thermal velocity .",
    "this part of their global deflection due to particle @xmath6 reduces the number of particles inside the sphere @xmath12 of radius @xmath13 about it .",
    "therefore the effective charge of particle @xmath6 as seen out of @xmath12 is reduced : the charge of particle @xmath6 is shielded due to these deflections . this shielding effect increases with @xmath9 , and thus with the distance to particle @xmath6 . as a result , the typical time - scale for shielding to set in when starting from random particle positions is the time for a thermal particle to cross a debye sphere , i.e.  @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the plasma frequency . furthermore , shielding is a cooperative dynamical process : it results from the accumulation of almost independent repulsive deflections with the same qualitative impact on the effective electric field of particle @xmath6 ( if point - like ions were present , the attractive deflection of charges with opposite signs would have the same effect ) .",
    "it is a cooperative effect , but not a collective one .",
    "so , shielding and collisional transport are two aspects of the same two - body repulsive process .",
    "this paper deals with the one component plasma model @xcite , which considers the plasma as infinite with spatial periodicity @xmath16 in three orthogonal directions with coordinates @xmath17 , and as made up of @xmath0 electrons in each elementary cube with volume @xmath1 .",
    "ions are present only as a uniform neutralizing background , which enables periodic boundary conditions .",
    "this choice is made to simplify the analysis which focuses on @xmath18 , the potential created by the @xmath0 particles at any point where there is no particle .",

    "@xmath218 corresponds to the spontaneous emission of waves by particles and induces an exponential relaxation of the waves to the thermal level in the case of landau damping .",
    "the second order calculation for the particles yields the diffusion and friction coefficients of the fokker - planck equation ruling the tail dynamics .",
    "this equation corresponds to the classical quasilinear result , plus a dynamical friction term mirroring the spontaneous emission of waves by particles , as found in the one - dimensional case in refs .",
    "@xcite .    finally , we point out that eqs  ( [ eqampl]-[delrsecwv ] ) enable to tackle the linear theory of langmuir waves by considering a single mechanical system @xcite .",
    "this is naturally obtained by considering the unperturbed plasma as made up of a series of monokinetic parallel beams , and each beam as an array of equidistributed particles .",
    "this approach finds eigenmodes corresponding to the landau instability @xcite , if the distribution function has a positive slope .",
    "if the slope is negative , it recovers the van kampen modes @xcite , as a series of beam modes providing landau damping as a result of the phase mixing of the latter .",
    "this phase mixing turns out to be also important to recover a correct growth of the wave amplitude in the unstable case ( section 3.8.3 of reference @xcite ) .",
    "we point out that in refs .",
    "@xcite the equivalent of eqs  ( [ eqampl],[delrsecwv ] ) was obtained without using any smoothing , but by a mechanical reduction of degrees of freedom , which made even stronger the idea of considering a single mechanical system .",
    "we now focus on the case where the particles have random initial positions , i.e.  where the plasma has a uniform density , and for simplicity we consider the plasma to be in thermal equilibrium",
    ". then the dynamics of particles has no collective aspect , but is ruled by the cumulative effect of two - body deflections .",
    "more specifically , we choose random @xmath42 s , and vanishing @xmath221 s and @xmath222 s , and we assume that at @xmath95 all particles are in the same cube with volume @xmath1 , and we consider the limit @xmath223 .",
    "in contrast , each particle has a well defined velocity , in such a way that the overall initial smoothed velocity distribution is close to some given function .",
    "we focus on particle @xmath36 which is assumed to be close to the center of the cube . in this section ,",
    "we approximate the true dynamics by that due to the shielded coulombian interactions , i.e.  we write @xmath224 with @xmath225 where @xmath226 is given by eq .",
    "( [ phi ] ) .",
    "we compute particle @xmath36 deflection in a sequence of steps .",
    "first , we use first order perturbation theory in @xmath227 , which shows the total deflection to be the sum of the individual deflections due to all other particles . for an impact parameter",
    "much smaller than @xmath134 , the deflection due to a particle turns out to be the perturbative value of the rutherford deflection due to this particle if it were alone .",
    "second , for a close encounter with particle @xmath124 , we show that the deflection of particle @xmath36 is exactly the one it would undergo if the other @xmath228 particles were absent .",
    "third , the deflection for an impact parameter of order @xmath134 is given by the rutherford expression multiplied by some function of the impact parameter reflecting shielding .",
    "these three steps yield an analytical expression for deflection whatever the impact parameter .",
    "we first compute @xmath46 by first order perturbation theory in @xmath227 , taking the ballistic motion defined by eq .",
    "( [ rl0 ] ) as zeroth order approximation .",
    "this yields @xmath229 where @xmath230 { { \\mathrm{d}}}t ' . \\label{delrlj1}\\ ] ] it is convenient to write @xmath231 where @xmath232 is the time of closest approach of the two ballistic orbits , and @xmath233 is the vector joining particle @xmath25 to particle @xmath36 at this time .",
    "then @xmath234 is the impact parameter of these two orbits when singled out .",
    "the initial random positions of the particles translate into random values of @xmath233 and of @xmath232 . the typical duration of the deflection of particle @xmath36 given by eq .",
    "( [ delrlj1 ] ) is @xmath235 where @xmath236 , but a certain number , say @xmath237 , of @xmath238 s are necessary for the deflection to be mostly completed . for a given @xmath239 and for @xmath240 , the deflection of particle @xmath36 given by eq .",
    "( [ delrlj1 ] ) is maximum if @xmath232 is in the interval @xmath241 $ ] .",
    "we notice that @xmath238 is about the inverse of the plasma frequency for @xmath242 and @xmath243 on the order of the thermal velocity .    for the sake of brevity , we compute here just the trace of the diffusion tensor for the particle velocities . to this end , we perform an average over all the @xmath42 s to get @xmath244 taking into account eq .",
    "( [ phi ] ) , and the fact that the initial positions are independently random , as well as the @xmath245 s for @xmath246 . therefore , though being due to the simultaneous scattering of particle @xmath36 with the many particles inside its debye sphere , @xmath247 turns out to be the sum of individual two - body deflections for @xmath239 s such that first order perturbation theory is correct .",
    "hence the contribution to @xmath247 of particles with given @xmath248 and @xmath243 can be computed as if it would result from successive two - body collisions , as was done in ref .",
    "@xcite and in many textbooks .    for an impact parameter",
    "much smaller than @xmath134 , the main contribution of @xmath249 $ ] to the deflection of particle @xmath36 comes from times @xmath250 where @xmath251 .",
    "therefore @xmath252 takes on its bare coulombian value , and @xmath247 is a first order approximation of the effect on particle @xmath36 of a rutherford collision with particle @xmath25 . comparing this approximate value with the exact",
    "one shows the perturbative calculation to be correct for @xmath253 , the distance of minimum approach of two electrons in a rutherford collision , as given by energy conservation .",
    "second , we consider the case of the close approach of particle @xmath124 to particle @xmath36 ,",
    "i.e.  @xmath254 .",
    "we write the acceleration of particle @xmath36 as @xmath255 for particle @xmath124 , we write the same equation by exchanging indices @xmath36 and @xmath124 . since the two particles are at distances much smaller than the inter - particle distance @xmath256 , the accelerations they get from all other particles are almost the same . therefore , when subtracting the two rigorous equations of motion , the two summations over @xmath25 almost cancel , yielding    @xmath257    which is the equation describing the rutherford collision of these two particles in their center of mass frame , in the absence of all other particles ( at such distances the shielded potential is the bare coulomb one ) .",
    "since @xmath258 , @xmath259 is much smaller than the @xmath238 s of the other particles .",
    "therefore the latter produce a negligible deflection of the center of mass during the rutherford two - body collision , and the deflection of particle @xmath36 during this collision is exactly that of a rutherford two - body collision . the contribution of such collisions to @xmath260 was calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "now , since the deflection of particle @xmath36 due to particle @xmath25 as computed by the above perturbation theory is an approximation of the rutherford deflection for the same impact parameter , we may approximate the perturbative deflection one by the full rutherford one , which provides an obvious matching of the theories for @xmath261 and for @xmath262 : we may use the estimate of @xcite in the whole domain @xmath263 .",
    "third , we deal with impact parameters of the order of @xmath134 .",
    "then the deflection due to particle @xmath25 must be computed with eq .",
    "( [ delrlj1 ] ) . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we make the calculation for the case where @xmath166 is small , which makes @xmath264 which is the yukawa potential @xmath265 ( eq .  ( 18 ) of ref .",
    "the first order correction in @xmath266 to this approximation is a dipolar potential with an electric dipole moment proportional to @xmath166 .",
    "since a maxwellian distribution is symmetrical in @xmath113 , these individual dipolar contributions cancel globally . as a result ,",
    "the first relevant correction to the yukawa potential is of second order in @xmath266 .",
    "this should make the yukawa approximation relevant for a large part of the bulk of the maxwellian distribution .    in the small deflection limit ,",
    "a calculation using the fact that the force derives from a central potential shows the full deflection of particle @xmath36 due to particle @xmath25 is provided by @xmath267 \\exp [ - \\frac{r(t)}{\\lambda_{\\rm{d}}}]{{\\mathrm{d}}}t , \\label{delrljt}\\ ] ] where @xmath268 and @xmath233 was defined with eq .",

    "\\label{delrljt2}\\ ] ] during time @xmath240 , a volume @xmath272 of particles with velocity @xmath166 and impact parameters between @xmath248 and @xmath273 produce the deflection of particle @xmath36 given by eq .",
    "( [ delrljtfin ] ) , and a contribution scaling like @xmath274 to @xmath247 .",
    "let @xmath275 be such that @xmath276 .",
    "the contribution of all impact parameters between @xmath275 and some @xmath277 is thus scaling like the integral @xmath278 . since for @xmath279 small @xmath280 , if @xmath281 , this is the non - shielded contribution of orbits relevant to the above perturbative calculation . since , by approximating it by the rutherford - like result of ref .",
    "@xcite , this contribution matches that for impact parameters on the order of @xmath282 , the contribution of all impact parameters between @xmath282 and some @xmath277 small with respect to @xmath134 is thus scaling like the integral @xmath283 as was computed in ref",
    ".  @xcite .",
    "the matching of this result for @xmath284 is simply accomplished by setting a factor @xmath285 in the integrand which makes the integral converge for @xmath286 . taking this limit",
    ", one finds that the coulomb logarithm @xmath287 of the second eq .",
    "( 14 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite becomes @xmath288 where @xmath289 is of order unity .",
    "if the full dependence of the shielding on @xmath166 were taken into account , the modification of the coulomb logarithm would be velocity dependent .    for the sake of brevity , we do not develop here the calculation of the dynamical friction which will be presented elsewhere .",
    "this calculation requires using second order perturbation theory , but follows the same lines as those for the diffusion coefficient .",
    "for an inhomogeneous plasma , the acceleration of particle @xmath36 may be split into a homogeneous and a wave part . when using the linearized versions of eq .",
    "( [ phihat ] ) and subsequent ones in section [ dsld ] , we can split all @xmath172 s and @xmath104 s into a homogeneous part and an independent inhomogeneous one . therefore the diffusion coefficient and the dynamical friction estimated by perturbative calculation of the dynamics up to second order are the sum of the collisional contribution and of a contribution due to waves , the latter as calculated for instance in refs .",
    "@xcite . for the sake of brevity ,",
    "we defer this point to later publication .",
    "in this paper , debye shielding , collisional transport , landau damping of langmuir waves , and spontaneous emission of these waves were introduced by a mechanical approach .",
    "this approach brings unification and simplification in basic microscopic plasma physics , and may be useful for pedagogical purposes",
    ". one might think about trying to apply the above approach to plasmas with more species , or with a magnetic field , or where particles experience trapping and chaotic dynamics .",
    "the first generalization sounds rather trivial , and the third one is under way , at least in one dimension ( see a pedestrian introduction in @xcite and more specific results in @xcite ) .    as in many textbooks ,",
    "linearization was applied in sections [ fep ] , [ scp ] , and [ stsp ] without questioning deeply its range of validity . however , the smallness of the perturbation is not a sufficient criterion . indeed , as reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite , perturbation theory that relies on linearization has to be questioned , as it yields a solution of the linearized set of equations only .",
    "whether it also generates a solution of the full set has to be shown explicitly , and this may be a hard task .",
    "for instance the full proof of existence of landau damping @xcite in a vlasovian frame was a mathematical tour de force , the equivalent of a kolmogorov - arnold - moser theorem for continuous systems , and led one of its authors to be awarded the 2010 fields medal .",
    "as to collisional transport , as usual , it was assumed that some kind of decorrelation justifies the calculation of the transport coefficients over the finite times considered in section [ dsct ] .",
    "however , in reality particle dynamics is chaotic , and one is facing the calculation of transport coefficients for a chaotic motion .",
    "one should be cautious as , for the motion of a charged particle in a spectrum of longitudinal waves , a perturbation calculation yields the quasilinear estimate for the diffusion coefficient , while a super - quasilinear regime , a synergetic effect in chaos , is found to exist in this chaotic dynamics for intermediate resonance overlap @xcite . there",
    ", diffusion becomes quasilinear for strong resonance overlap , but not because the perturbation calculation becomes valid again ( @xcite , section 6.8.2 of @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , we used only a very specific part of the fundamental equation ( [ phihat ] ) : the one involving linearization and smoothing . it would be interesting to study the effect of the coupling of fourier components with both coherent and incoherent effects , in particular , to perform the analysis of section [ wpdrt ] by substituting @xmath290 with @xmath291",
    "the question arises : is it possible to recover the hole solutions propagating near thermal velocity or slower , which are smooth and nonlinear structures satisfying the full nonlinear vlasov - poisson system ( ref .",
