    "ultra - luminous infrared ( ir ) galaxies ( @xmath11 ) and most luminous ir galaxies ( lirgs ; @xmath12 ) are almost always found in interacting or merging systems ( , sanders 1988 ; melnick & mirabel 1990 ; murphy 1996 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "only a small fraction of optically selected interacting / merging galaxy systems are truly ir - luminous ( , arp 1966 ; arp & madore 1977 ; kennicutt 1987 ; bushouse 1988 ) .",
    "apparently , galaxy interaction is a common causal factor for the enhanced ir luminosity , but it is not the only one ( lawrence 1989 ; leech 1994 ) .",
    "as the large ir luminosity can be explained by a burst of star formation and almost all lirgs are found to be molecular gas - rich ( sanders 1991 ; solomon 1996 ) , understanding of lirg mergers then depends on how interaction induces starbursts and enhances the star formation efficiency in these merging systems .",
    "a study of the gas properties at various phases of the merging process would help identify the key physical processes involved .",
    "for example , all four ultra - luminous ir galaxies and most lirgs in advanced merging stages observed with sufficiently high spatial resolution , show a high co surface brightness in their nuclear region with an extent @xmath13 1 kpc typically .",
    "this has been interpreted as a very high central h@xmath4 surface density , usually more than 10@xmath14  @xmath15 ( scoville 1991 ; yun & scoville 1995 ) .",
    "few studies have been able to explore the gas - rich galaxy mergers over various merging phases ( , combes 1994 ) . in a study of 50 lirg mergers ,",
    "the co luminosity is found to increase with increasing separation of the merging nuclei , which may imply that the molecular gas content of lirgs is decreasing as merging advances ( gao 1996 ; gao & solomon 1996 ) .",
    "previous studies have concentrated on relatively more advanced merger systems in which the interstellar medium ( ism ) has already been highly disrupted by the starbursts . in order to isolate the conditions in the ism _ leading _ to starbursts",
    ", we are starting a program to study a sample of lirgs chosen to represent different phases of the interacting / merging process , using the newly expanded berkeley - illinois - maryland association ( bima ) millimeter - wave array ( welch 1996 ) which is ideally suited to this problem given its large primary beam and wide spectral bandwidth .",
    "the goal is to sample statistically the evolution of the properties of the molecular clouds in the galaxies as they go through the merging processes .    here , we present the first results of this program on arp 302 .",
    "arp 302 ( ugc 09618 ) consists of two galaxies ( vv340a and vv340b  sb and sc , with apparent magnitudes 14.6@xmath16 and 15.3@xmath16 , respectively ) with a separation of @xmath1 between the two nuclei . at a median redshift ( cz ) of  10160",
    ",  its luminosity distance ,  d@xmath17 ,  is 136.6 mpc ( @xmath18 mpc@xmath19 , q@xmath20= 1/2 ) and it has an infrared luminosity ,  @xmath21 ,  of   @xmath22 .",
    "single - dish measurements show a co luminosity @xmath23 k  pc@xmath24 , which corresponds to a molecular gas mass of @xmath25 , the largest amount of molecular gas known among the samples of @xmath26 lirg mergers studied recently by gao ( 1996 ) and @xmath27 ultra - luminous galaxies surveyed by solomon ( 1996 ) . given the large ir luminosity and the close proximity of the two galaxies",
    ", the normal assumption would be that arp 302 is powered by starbursts that result from the interaction of the two galaxies .",
    "the relative large separation ( @xmath5 25 kpc = @xmath1 at the angular distance of 136(1+z)@xmath28 = 128 mpc ) compared to merger remnants such as arp 220 would further suggest that arp 302 is in an early phase of merging / interacting .",
    "observations of arp 302 were started with the bima 6-element array in october 1995 .",
    "more observations were made with the new 9-element array in the c configuration in april and b configuration in may 1996 ( welch 1996 ) .",
    "the digital correlator was used with the widest bandwidth to cover a velocity range of 1,600 , at a resolution of 8.4 . the @xmath29 primary beam",
    "was centered between the two galaxies to cover all possible emission in this interacting system which extends slightly more than @xmath30 .",
    "the observing frequency was 111.4952 ghz , corresponding to the co(1 - 0 ) line at the median redshift cz=10,160  of this merging galaxy system .",
    "the nearby quasar 3c345 , used for the complex antenna gain calibration , was observed for 8 minutes before every 30 minutes on arp 302 .",
    "the strong quasar 3c273 was observed at the beginning for 30 minutes to calibrate the spectral dependence of the gain .",
    "the typical system temperature ranged between 300 and 800 k.    the interferometer data were reduced with the miriad data reduction package ( sault 1995 ) .",
    "observations in may 1996 on baselines longer than 50 k@xmath31 were found to suffer from atmospheric decorrelation and were therefore weighted by applying a gaussian taper ( effective resolution of 35 ) in the uv plane prior to inverting the uv data cube .",
    "data cubes of the co brightness distribution , @xmath32 , where x and y are the spatial coordinates and v is the radial velocity , at various velocity resolutions ( 8.4 , 20.0 and 50.0 ) were created covering the range from @xmath33600 to 600  about cz = 10,160 .",
    "the cleaned maps have a final synthesized beam of @xmath34 , with the major axis of the beam at a position angle of 10@xmath35 .",
    "the various moment maps were then made to produce the integrated intensity map ( @xmath36 in k- ) , the intensity weighted velocity map , and the intensity weighted velocity dispersion map .",
    "in figure 1 ( plate ) , the contours of an integrated co intensity map at @xmath34 resolution are superposed on a r - band ccd image of arp 302 ( left panel ) ; whereas the right panels show the co spectra from various locations in arp 302 .",
    "the @xmath37 distribution is very well correlated with the r - band ccd image of the galaxies , especially along the prominent dust lane in the northern edge - on galaxy vv340a .",
    "the co emission is especially bright in the inner @xmath38 , or @xmath58.7 kpc . at the angular distance of 128 mpc",
    ", @xmath39 corresponds to 620 pc .    about @xmath40 of the total co flux ( @xmath41 in jy  )",
    "is from the edge - on galaxy , distributed along the major - axis over @xmath42 and marginally resolved along the minor axis .",
    "if the co emission is coplanar with the galactic disk , the shape of the co distribution would place a limit on the inclination angle , i , of the galaxy to be @xmath43 .",
    "while @xmath44 of the total co flux is from the southern galaxy vv340b , the co surface brightness is weaker , well resolved by the @xmath34 beam , and appears correlated with the central bar .",
    "some correspondence of weak co emission with the northern spiral arm is also indicated ( fig .",
    "1 ) . within the uncertainties ,",
    "all the co flux detected from these two galaxies with the nrao 12 m telescope ( gao 1996 ) is detected in the bima maps .",
    "we have also detected co emission from a position away from the two galaxies at the position : @xmath45(j2000.0)=14@xmath4657@xmath4701.@xmath486 , @xmath49(j2000.0)=24@xmath503648  ( spectrum labelled off in fig .",
    "1 ) that does not correspond to any optical feature .",
    "the reality of this interesting source has to be verified by further observations .",
    "figure 2 shows a position - velocity diagram of the co surface brightness in vv340a along the major axis ( pa @xmath51 ) with @xmath56  and 20  resolution .",
    "it shows that the kinematics of the molecular gas in vv340a has largely a constant velocity gradient ( 85.5  kpc@xmath19 ) within the central @xmath52 , or @xmath58.7 kpc , along the major axis and a velocity range of 780  at fwzi .",
    "the faint co emission to the north of the central 15  ( @xmath53 kpc ) appears to have a constant velocity between 260  and 344 , and to the south between @xmath33180  and @xmath33210 . at the extreme southern end of the disk , the integrated intensity map ( fig .",
    "1 ) shows a slight deviation westward from the linear morphology exhibited by the rest of the galaxy .",
    "in the same region , the velocity field also has a distortion from the rotational signature .",
    "this could be interpreted as evidence that the interaction between the two galaxies has perturbed the molecular gas distribution .",
    "a constant velocity gradient has often been described as indicating a `` solid - body '' rotating disk . in the case of the inner @xmath52 of vv340a",
    ", the `` solid - body '' disk would have a 4.35 kpc radius . alternately , a 8.7 kpc diameter rotating molecular ring , while also consistent with the constant velocity gradient , would be easier to understand dynamically .",
    "a ring of molecular gas may also explain the shape of the co spectrum from vv340 a ( fig .",
    "1 ) , and the weakness of co emission near the systemic velocity ( @xmath54 in the figures , or cz = 10200 ) from the nuclear region . thus ,",
    "a strong concentration of molecular gas in a ring structure rotating with a circular speed of 390  ( corresponding to the inner disk ) combined with a thin , extended , molecular gas disk with a flat rotation velocity of @xmath5240  viewed edge on would be consistent with the observations .",
    "we note , however , that the observed systemic velocities of the rotating ring and disk , if taken as the centroid of the extent of each respective component , differ by @xmath530 .",
    "this may arise if the distribution of material in the plane of vv340a is not axi - symmetric and has non - circular motions .",
    "further study of the gas kinematics is necessary .",
    "there is a velocity gradient across vv340b as well , although the total velocity extent across vv340b is only @xmath55 ( fwzi ) .",
    "given the large amount of molecular gas and the narrow line - width , the galaxy must be nearly face - on , which is consistent with the shape of the galaxy in the r  band image ( fig .",
    "1 ) .    from the centroid of the co line profiles for vv340a and b , we determine the relative systemic velocity between the two galaxies , @xmath56 , with vv340b blueshifted relative to vv340a .",
    "thus , the spin vector of vv340a could be nearly parallel to the orbital angular momentum vector of vv340b , unless a very large relative transverse motion exists .",
    "arp 302 is the most co luminous system known in the local universe , more luminous in co than those ultra - luminous galaxies out to the redshift of @xmath57 ( solomon 1996 ) .",
    "the total molecular gas mass of each galaxy can be estimated from the total co flux , using @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the luminosity distance in mpc and @xmath60 is the total co flux in jy .",
    "we use the conversion factor , @xmath61 = 3.0 \\times 10^{20 } ~cm^{-2}/(k \\kms)}$ ] for convenient comparison to previous results , even though it is not a priori applicable to arp 302 .",
    "the h@xmath4 gas mass in vv340a is @xmath62 , with 85% in the central 8.7 kpc .",
    "the dynamical mass interior to the rotating molecular ring ( 4.35 kpc radius ) is estimated to be @xmath63 .",
    "this implies that if he is included , the gas mass constitutes 60% of the dynamical mass of vv340a within a radius of 4.35 kpc .",
    "the h@xmath4 gas mass in vv340b is @xmath64 .",
    "the combined h@xmath4 gas mass in this merging system is ( @xmath65 .    the hi mass in arp 302 has been measured to be @xmath66 ( mirabel & sanders 1988 ) .",
    "thus , the total gas ( hi + h@xmath4 + he ) content of arp 302 is @xmath67 .",
    "even if x is 5 times smaller , the total gas content would still be @xmath68 .",
    "however , this does point to the importance of a direct determination of the conversion factor x for arp 302 .",
    "although the southern end of the vv340a molecular disk is distorted , no molecular gas has been detected between the two galaxies in the disk overlap region .",
    "but , the co source to the east of vv340a has a molecular mass of @xmath69 .",
    "the spatial extent of the co source in arp 302 provides estimates of the face - on @xmath70 surface density , @xmath71 .",
    "thus , we obtain @xmath71 of @xmath72 within the radius of 4.35 kpc and @xmath73 in the outer disk in vv340a , and @xmath74 for the inner part of vv340b . in the inner parts of both galaxies , @xmath71 is high compared to that of the milky way disk ( 4 @xmath33 17  @xmath15 ; sanders 1984 ) , but small compared to that of the lirgs and ultra - luminous galaxies at the more advanced merger stage ( typically @xmath75 ; , yun & scoville 1995 ) .",
    "while the @xmath0 certainly qualifies arp 302 as a lirg , the co emission is extended over the entire @xmath523 kpc diameter disk in vv340a and over many kpc in vv340b .",
    "the large co extent is in stark contrast to most of the more than 20 lirgs and ultra - luminous galaxies for which high spatial resolution co(1 - 0 ) observations have been made .",
    "they showed highly concentrated co emission in nuclear regions @xmath76 kpc in size typically ( scoville 1991 ) .",
    "spatially unresolved observations of lirgs showed that they tend to have very large @xmath21  and  @xmath77 , usually interpreted as indicating very high star formation rate and h@xmath4 gas mass , as well as very high star formation efficiency ( , @xmath8(h@xmath9 ; solomon & sage 1988 ; young 1989 ; sanders 1991 ; solomon 1996 ) . from spatially resolved observations , one can derive local measures of co surface brightness both in terms of @xmath78 and @xmath79 converted to @xmath71 , the h@xmath4 surface density . for lirgs and ultra - luminous galaxies ,",
    "all these quantities are extremely high compared to galactic values ( , scoville 1991 ; sargent & scoville 1991 ; yun 1994 ; yun & scoville 1995 )    the ratio of @xmath80 , used to indicate the star formation efficiency , ranges between 20 to 100  @xmath81 for nuclear starburst regions ( scoville 1991 ) . for arp 302 ,",
    "the global ratio is 5 @xmath81 .",
    "if we scale the ir luminosity and extent with those of the radio continuum emission from arp 302 ( condon 1990 ; condon 1991 ) , we obtain values of 6 , 2.5 and 2 @xmath81 for @xmath8(h@xmath9 in the inner 8.7 kpc region and the outer part of vv340a , and vv340b , respectively .",
    "this is comparable to the ratio for giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) in the milky way ( @xmath8(h@xmath82 , scoville & good 1989 ) but much below that observed in arp 220 ( 95 @xmath81 ) and other starburst systems ( scoville 1991 ) .",
    "furthermore , we can infer a mean ir surface brightness ( @xmath83 )  of 7000 , 55 and 300  @xmath84 for the same three regions respectively .",
    "this is very low compared to the typical @xmath85 in nuclear starburst regions ( lo 1987 , and scoville 1991 ) .",
    "therefore , the high ir luminosity in arp 302 arises simply because an extremely large amount of molecular gas is forming high mass stars at a rate similar to the gmc s in the disk of the milky way and not because starbursts are occurring in the galactic nuclei .",
    "the two galaxies ( vv340a and vv340b ) in arp 302 have a projected nuclear separation of @xmath86 and a velocity difference of 340 .",
    "are the two galaxies physically associated , and not just chance superposition ? it has been shown via monte carlo simulations that the posterior probability of two galaxies brighter than 15@xmath16 with a velocity difference of between 200 and 1000  being bound is 0.88 ( schweizer 1987 ) . furthermore , the distortion of the co distribution in the southern end of vv340a may be an indication that the two galaxies are in fact interacting .",
    "the hi emission line profile from arp 302 ( u 09618 in mirabel & sanders 1988 ) is significantly different from the co profile , in that hi emission appears to be missing at the velocities corresponding to vv340a .",
    "future vla observations of hi in arp 302 may show direct evidence for the interaction of the two galaxies in terms of hi tidal tails and the kinematic signature .    we can also estimate the ratio of the kinetic and potential energies of the interacting system : @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the reduced mass , v is the relative velocity , and r is the nuclear separation of the two galaxies with masses , @xmath89 . if @xmath90 as implied from their comparable extent ,   @xmath91 ,  and  @xmath92 .",
    "for @xmath93 , where v@xmath94 is the rotational velocity of vv340a at the outermost radius r@xmath95 , @xmath96 .",
    "since @xmath97 with v 340  ( if the transverse motion is taken into account )  and  r @xmath98 ( the projected separation ) , it is plausible that t / u is on the order of unity and e = t @xmath33 u @xmath99 .",
    "( if the mass of one galaxy is substantially less than the other , the t / u ratio would change by a factor of two . )",
    "this analysis suggests that the two galaxies could be on parabolic orbits about each other .",
    "the relative radial systemic velocity of the two galaxies is 340  and the spin of vv340a is parallel to the apparent orbital motion .",
    "this indicates that the disk of vv340a may be undergoing a prograde encounter with its perturber vv340b , unless there is a very large transverse motion between the two galaxies .",
    "numerical simulations have shown that two gas rich galaxies of comparable mass released on parabolic orbits , with the mass and orientations similar to those found in arp 302 , would merge within two orbital times , or a few times 10@xmath100 years ( barnes and hernquist 1991 ; see also white 1979 ; toomre & toomre 1972 ) .",
    "thus , we conclude that the high probability that the two galaxies in arp 302 are bound , the distortion in the co distribution in vv340a , the plausibly small total energy of the two galaxies , and the numerical simulation results are all indications to suggest that arp 302 is an interacting system .    given both the stars and the gas distribution in arp 302 system",
    "do not appear highly disturbed , the two galaxies are apparently approaching each other for the first time , suggesting that arp 302 is in an early phase of the interaction . the next phase of arp 302",
    "may be represented by the galaxy vv114 ( yun 1994 ) , in which the molecular gas has merged into a common envelop before turning into an ultra - luminous galaxy .",
    "with the bima array , we have resolved the co emission from the luminous ir galaxy system arp 302 into galactic scale distributions .",
    "local measures in arp 302 , such as @xmath101 , are all much smaller than those found in starburst systems .",
    "thus , the enormous ir luminosity of arp 302 is apparently not due to starbursts , but is due to its unusually large amount of molecular gas forming stars at a rate similar to giant molecular clouds in the milky way disk .",
    "also , evidence suggests that the two galaxies in arp 302 are interacting and at an early phase of the interaction .",
    "as the interaction progresses , bursts of star formation may eventually be initiated .",
    "if so , we may be witnessing two interacting gas - rich galaxies in a pre - starburst phase . identifying and studying such systems are important for isolating the conditions in the ism that will _ lead _ to starbursts .",
