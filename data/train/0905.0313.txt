    "studying highly idealized models of vibrating self - gravitating fluid masses forms one of important issues of theoretical asteroseismology which seeks to explain variability in brightness of an observable object as being produced by its vibrations . among central to this domain of astrophysics is kelvin fluid - mechanical model of a heavy mass of inviscid incompressible liquid of uniform density @xmath1 undergoing free oscillations with nodeless irrotational velocity of fluctuating flow@xcite .",
    "an outstanding importance of this fiducial model , whose extended discussion can be found in refs . [ 2 - 7 ] , is that it sets the standard for analytic study of non - radial pulsations of the main - sequence stars and serves as an example , according to chandrasekhar@xcite , of `` at least one problem for which analytic solution can be found '' and which illustrates `` the type of difficulties one must confront in the other problem '' , because `` in most instances , the problems become of such complexity and involve so many parameters that elementary methods of solution seem impracticable '' .",
    "it is this model from which the very notion of fundamental vibrational mode has come into the theory of stellar pulsations@xcite .",
    "the characteristic peculiarity of a liquid star vibrating in fundamental mode is that the velocity of oscillating flow is described by the potential vector field whose potential obey the laplace equation of the form @xmath2 the last equation exhibits node - free character of the velocity field as a function of distance from center to the surface of the star .",
    "it is this feature of oscillating flow is regarded as the major kinematic signature of fundamental vibration mode . in the kelvin model of homogeneous mass of a heavy incompressible liquid , implying that the density is not altered , @xmath3 , the above equations emerge from the continuity equation @xmath4 our purpose here is to explore some peculiarities of the fundamental vibration mode in astrophysical object with inhomogeneous distribution of mass . in",
    "so doing we consider a model of highly inhomogeneous stellar object in which the non - uniform density profile has singularity at the star center of the form @xmath5 one of the most conspicuous features of this density profile is that the total mass of such a star @xmath6 is finite and identical to that for the total mass of the canonical homogenous liquid star model .",
    "in somewhat different context the model of inhomogeneous liquid star with similar density profile has been briefly discussed by clayton@xcite .",
    "this curious feature of the model , which from now on is referred to as the singular star model , is interesting in its own right because it permits too analytically tractable solution of the eigenfrequency problem for @xmath0-mode .",
    "perhaps the most striking feature distinguishing vibrational behavior of inhomogeneous from homogeneous mass is that the nodeless non - rotational vibrations of a spherical liquid mass of non - uniform density are of substantially compressional character , as it follows from the continuity equation .",
    "one of the prime purposes of our study here , therefore , is to find out how this striking distinction between the density profiles is reflected in the frequency and lifetime spectra of fundamental vibration mode .",
