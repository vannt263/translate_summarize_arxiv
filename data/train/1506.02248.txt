    "quasiclassical theory of superconductivity @xcite is a powerful tool for comprehensive analysis of the superconducting state .",
    "quasiclassical methods are well suited to study a broad range of phenomena with characteristic energies / frequencies well below the fermi energy @xmath0 and characteristic lengths strongly exceeding the fermi wavelength or , equivalently , the inverse fermi momentum @xmath1 . within this approach",
    "all relevant information about the superconducting state can be extracted from the energy - integrated matrix green - eilenberger function @xmath2 which generally depends on the electron momentum direction as well as on both coordinate and time variables .",
    "the quasiclassical eilenberger formalism also accounts for electron scattering at various impurities and boundary imperfections which are inevitably present in virtually any metallic sample . in general such scattering processes",
    "can make the quasiclassical electron trajectory in a metal very complicated in which case the function @xmath2 may become rather involved .",
    "usadel @xcite demonstrated that substantial simplification can be achieved provided the concentration of non - magnetic impurities in a system is sufficiently large . in this case electron scattering at such impurities turns its trajectory into a diffusive one and the matrix function @xmath2 becomes almost isotropic in the momentum space .",
    "the eilenberger equation then reduces to the usadel one for the momentum averaged quasiclassical green function matrix @xcite .",
    "usually the usadel approximation works well in the so - called dirty limit , i.e. provided the electron elastic mean free path @xmath3 remains much shorter than the superconducting coherence length of a clean system @xmath4 .",
    "however , there exists a number of interesting phenomena which can not be captured within the usadel approximation even in the limit @xmath5 .",
    "one of them is the thermoelectric effect in superconductors doped with magnetic impurities @xcite as well as in superconducting hybrids with spin - active interfaces @xcite .",
    "different scattering rates for electrons and holes at magnetic impurities or interfaces yield electron - hole imbalance generation in such systems which in turn results in a large enhancement of thermoelectric currents .",
    "this electron - hole imbalance effectively implies anisotropy of the quasiparticle distribution function in the momentum space @xcite .",
    "it turns out that this effect can not be recovered from the standard usadel equation for the momentum - averaged quasiclassical green functions .",
    "one of the aims of this paper is to extend further the usadel perturbative expansion in the parameter @xmath6 and to derive the leading order correction to the usadel equation which would enable one to properly account for the momentum anisotropy of the distribution function mentioned above .",
    "another our aim is to employ this formalism in order to study the so - called photoelectric effect in superconducting - normal ( sn ) hybrid structures .",
    "the essence of this effect is the appearance of a dc voltage drop across a superconductor as a result of its inhomogeneous absorption of light .",
    "it is commonly accepted that an external electromagnetic ac field can not cause any charge imbalance in a superconductor @xcite : photon absorption just produces a pair of electron - like and hole - like excitations and does not lead to any shift of the chemical potential .",
    "this observation remains applicable as long as both the density of states and quasiparticle scattering rates are symmetric with respect to electrons and holes .",
    "electron - hole imbalance occurs provided one takes into account the energy dependence of the normal state density of states near the fermi energy @xcite .",
    "the corresponding effect is relatively small for generic metals without anomalies in the density of states in the vicinity of the fermi level .",
    "accordingly , the magnitude of the photoelectric effect in conventional superconductors is expected to be small in the parameter @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a critical temperature of a superconductor .",
    "the situation changes dramatically if one considers superconductors doped with randomly distributed magnetic impurities . in this case scattering of quasiparticles on such impurities",
    "may lead to significant electron - hole asymmetry resulting , in turn , in a strong enhancement of the photoelectric effect @xcite which amplitude is not anymore controlled by the small parameter @xmath7 .",
    "interestingly enough , it turns out that this large photoelectric effect can not be captured within the usual usadel equation formalism . in order to correctly describe this effect in diffusive superconductors doped with magnetic impurities",
    "it is necessary to go beyond the standard usadel approximation and to include anisotropic ( gradient ) corrections . this will be demonstrated below in our paper .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec - quas ]",
    "we will extend the usadel expansion of the quasiclassical green - eilenberger functions and derive the leading order correction to the usadel equation describing superconductors in the diffusive limit .",
    "in section [ sec - thermo ] we will demonstrate the advantages of our approach by briefly re - deriving the expression for large thermoelectric currents which may flow in superconductors doped with magnetic impurities . in section [ sec - photo",
    "] we will apply our formalism in order to analyze the photoelectric effect in sn structures with magnetic impurities .",

    "<S> we extend the quasiclassical formalism for diffusive superconductors by deriving anisotropic ( gradient ) corrections to the usadel equation . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that in a number of physical situations such corrections may play a crucial role being responsible for the effects which can not be recovered within the standard usadel approximation . </S>",
    "<S> one of them is the so - called photoelectric effect in superconductors and superconducting - normal ( sn ) hybrid structures . </S>",
    "<S> provided a superconducting part of the system is irradiated by an external ac electromagnetic field the charge imbalance develops and a non - vanishing dc voltage is induced across the sn interface . in the presence of magnetic impurities in a superconductor </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude of this effect becomes large and can easily be detected in modern experiments . </S>"
