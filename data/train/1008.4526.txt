    "[ sec : intro ] evaporation of thin liquid films and sessile droplets has attracted much attention both as the way to probe the dynamics of the contact line @xcite and as a route to create deposition patterns through sedimentation of solutes and suspensions @xcite .",
    "a number of studies concentrate on problems pertinent to any evaporation process , which include mass and heat transfer and thermocapillarity @xcite . for slowly evaporating small sessile droplets studied in contemporary well - controlled experiments on smooth surfaces @xcite , thermal effects are , however , insignificant , while contact line dynamics and liquid - substrate interactions play a major role .",
    "it has been suggested that the relation between spreading and evaporation / condensation goes both ways , so that the latter may alleviate the notorious contact line singularity @xcite . for background on spreading see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "a remarkable phenomenon observed in evaporating completely wetting liquids is the formation of a dynamic meniscus with a finite contact angle @xcite .",
    "the standard approach to computing the form of a spreading and evaporating drop and the resulting dynamic contact angle @xcite is based on the lubrication approximation with the singularity at the contact line alleviated by slip .",
    "the evaporation rate is treated in three alternative ways .",
    "one possibility , realized in the presence of a temperature difference between the substrate and vapor phase @xcite , is the evaporation rate determined by the balance of latent heat and heat flux .",
    "the evaporation rate is then uniform in the limit of small biot numbers , but diverges near the contact line in the opposite limit .",
    "both limits can also be realized under isothermal conditions .",
    "the evaporation rate is uniform ( as long as the layer thickness remains outside the range of intermolecular forces ) when evaporation is controlled either by phase transition kinetics at the interface or by diffusion through a boundary layer of constant thickness in a stirred vessel .",
    "if evaporation is diffusionally controlled with no stirring , the evaporation rate increases towards the contact line ; an analytical solution based on interfacial equilibrium with no flux onto the unwetted substrate yields the flux diverging on the contact line @xcite .",
    "another approach accounts for the influence of the thermal conductivity of the substrate and the dependence of the vapor saturation concentration on temperature @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to present a simple isothermal thin film evolution equation with evaporation limited by phase transition kinetics ( or boundary layer transfer , but not diffusion ) , that correctly describes the influence of effective molecular interactions on evaporation in the case of complete wetting .",
    "this is achieved by taking into account the dependence of the saturated vapor pressure on the disjoining pressure and curvature in the way it has been done in studies of the dynamics of evaporating films @xcite but not in the cited studies of droplet spreading .",
    "this allows us to describe in a consistent way the transition from the bulk droplet to a precursor layer and eliminate singularities at the contact line .",
    "note however , that our model may be obtained as the isothermal limit of the models in @xcite , i.e. , letting the difference of substrate and ambient temperature , and the latent heat go to zero .",
    "it also corresponds to the limit of infinite thermal conductivity of the liquid .",
    "following @xcite , we consider a two - dimensional `` fed '' system that allows us to study steady states of evaporating droplets .",
    "these steady states are compared to droplet shapes resulting from a time evolution of an evaporating droplet ( without influx ) .",
    "the comparison will be employed to discuss a possible special role the steady state profiles play in the time evolution .",
    "a related approach is taken in ref .",
    "@xcite where steady fronts of evaporating liquid on an incline are considered .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "the following section  [ sec : mod ] introduces our model and discusses the scaling , whereas section  [ sec : asymp ] discusses the asymptotics in the precursor film .",
    "section  [ sec : ssd ] discusses the properties of steady drops with influx as a function of the influx strength and of the single remaining dimensionless parameter .",
    "the time - evolution in the case without influx is analysed in section  [ sec : timesim ] where we also compare the steady drop profiles in the case with influx to the time - dependent profiles in the non - fed case .",
    "section  [ sec : disconc ] gives our conclusions .",
    "[ sec : mod ] for simplicity , we restrict our attention to a two - dimensional system as sketched in fig .  [",

    "the function @xmath4 is the influx through the ( locally ) porous substrate .",
    "the evaporative flux is proportional to the difference between the chemical potential of the ambient vapour and the chemical potential in the liquid @xmath5 ; @xmath6 is pressure , @xmath7 is an effective evaporation rate constant ; and @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the surface tension , mass density and dynamic viscosity of the liquid , respectively .",
    "the pressure @xmath6 contains the curvature pressure @xmath11 and the disjoining pressure @xmath12 modelling wettability @xcite ; the hydrostatic pressure is neglected as we focus on nano- and micro - droplets .    to model a droplet of completely wetting liquid , we employ a long - range stabilising van der waals disjoining pressure @xmath13 with the hamaker constant @xmath14 @xcite .",

    "the model  ( [ film ] ) is related to various models in the literature : it may be obtained from the one in @xcite by adding an influx and replacing the disjoining pressure for a partially wetting liquid by one for a wetting liquid .",

    "note , however , that lubrication approximation often still predicts the qualitative behavior for many systems with larger contact angles @xcite . when considering the results obtained with models like eqs .",
    "( [ film ] ) , one has always to keep in mind that even very large contact angles obtained in lubrication approximation ( measured as slopes at the inflection point of the drop profiles ) correspond to rather small angles in physical scaling .",
    "another horizontal scale , applicable in the precursor layer , is determined by the balance of flow driven by the disjoining pressure gradient and evaporation : @xmath24 this scale is large when evaporation is slow .",
    "it is appropriate to choose @xmath25 as the horizontal scale , assuming it to be of the same order of magnitude as the third available scale  the droplet size .",
    "the respective time scale is @xmath26 , and the flux @xmath27 is scaled by @xmath28 .    retaining the same notation for the rescaled variables , we rewrite eqs .",

    "the family of steady profiles does not approach the trajectories of evaporating profiles when the drops become small . even for very small drops",
    "their contact angle remains always larger by a roughly constant factor than the one of the evaporating drops .",
    "the factor is about two for @xmath81 and approaches four for @xmath79 .",
    "( iv ) the overall picture in fig .",
    "[ fig : pp - volmax ] for different @xmath51 looks very similar , only the @xmath109 axes scale differently .",
    "a similar observation holds for the representations as given in figs .",
    "[ fig : pp - anglemax ] to  [ fig : prof - evol1 ] where , however , both axes would need to be scaled .",
    "next , we discuss the behaviour of the different initial drop profiles at early times .",
    "we use fig .",
    "[ fig : pp - anglemax ] as an example . for larger @xmath51",
    "the behaviour is slightly less pronounced , but all the curves look qualitatively the same ( not shown ) . for instance",
    ", one obtains a plot that is roughly the one for @xmath79 when scaling the @xmath109-axis and @xmath76-axis of fig .",
    "[ fig : pp - anglemax ] by factors of 1/6 and 1/40 , respectively .",
    "a similar rule applies to fig .",
    "[ fig : angletime ] , when additionally scaling time by about 1/5 . in figs .",
    "[ fig : pp - anglemax ] and  [ fig : angletime ] , one finds for the initial parabola profile a strong decrease in the apparent contact angle at early times . this corresponds to an adjustment of the contact line region to the influences of the disjoining pressure . as the central drop region",
    "nearly coincides with the initial steady profile ( per definition at same volume and height ) the two curves approach each other rather fast .",
    "in the course of the time evolution the central part of the profile remains a parabola .",
    "however , for the gaussian at early times the contact angle changes non - monotonically : the profile adjusts on the one hand its contact line region to the disjoining pressure influences ( related to the `` earlier wiggle '' in the curve for the parabola in fig .",
    "[ fig : pp - anglemax ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "its central region adapts to a parabola ( second `` wiggle '' in the curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : pp - anglemax ] ) .",
    "all three profiles approach each other after the initial adjustments .",
    "their central part can be well fitted by a parabola , e.g. , for @xmath106 [ @xmath107 ] and @xmath81 down to thicknesses of about @xmath111 [ @xmath112 . keeping the drop volume constant , that thickness decreases with increasing @xmath51 and vice versa .",
    "in contrast , the steady profile of the drop with influx can be fitted by a parabola in a smaller central part of the drop .",
    "the deviation from the parabola becomes clearly visible , e.g. , for @xmath106 [ @xmath107 ] and @xmath81 at about @xmath113 [ @xmath111 ] ( already 20 - 30% below the maximum ) .",
    "this percentage range remains roughly the same when changing @xmath51 for fixed drop volume .",
    "our direct comparison of evaporating steady state drops with influx and evaporating drops without influx shows that the former can not be used to approximate the latter as their shapes always differ .",
    "a freely evaporating shrinking drop has always a smaller apparent contact angle than the steady fed drop . this has been shown for a wide range of length scale ratios from @xmath81 to @xmath79 .",
    "note , however , that the differences slowly decrease for decreasing @xmath51 .",

    "further we perform a number of simulations starting with large parabolic drops .",
    "[ fig : prof - large ] gives a set of space time plots obtained for different length scale ratios from @xmath81 to @xmath79 .",
    "all of them start from the identical initial profile . for small @xmath87 [ panels ( a ) and ( b ) ] the behaviour is very similar to the one described above for drops with the same initial geometry as the steady drops : the drops shrink monotonically , their height and width decrease slowly .",
    "however , at larger @xmath86 [ panels ( c ) and ( d ) ] the behaviour is qualitatively different : at early times the drops spread .",
    "thereby they loose height and gain width quite fast , the apparent contact angle decreases strongly .",
    "then the drop reaches a maximal width before the contact line starts to recede again . in the shrinking stage , the height and width of the drop decrease slowly as before .",
    "the spreading is faster for larger @xmath51 [ fig .",

    "the contact angle for the initial profile is in all cases @xmath118 . comparing this with fig .",
    "[ fig : vol2](b ) one notices that this angle roughly coincides with the limiting contact angle ( for large drops ) for @xmath119 .",
    "this value lies between the regions ( in @xmath51 ) where we find receding and spreading evaporating drops , respectively . extrapolating from this finding",
    ", we formulate the hypothesis that the steady state drops with influx studied above in section  [ sec : ssd ] represent limiting solutions between the case of spreading and shrinking freely evaporating drops ( without influx ) .     and the length scale ratio @xmath51 we indicate where the drop initially spreads , and where the contact line recedes right from the beginning .",
    "each symbol corresponds to a time simulation .",
    "the solid line corresponds to the numeric result characterising the large steady drops with influx ( cf .",
    "[ fig : vol2](b ) ) . ]",
    "[ fig : evap - phase ]    to test the hypothesis we perform a number of time simulations with parabolic initial drops of different initial contact angle and at different @xmath51 .",
    "all of them are of the same ( large ) volume .",
    "the results are given as a scatter plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : evap - phase ] together with the curve for the large steady drops obtained in section  [ sec : ssd ] [ solid line of fig .",
    "[ fig : vol2](b ) ] . for each initial condition",
    "we record whether the drop spreads initially or directly starts to recede .",
    "our results indicate that the above hypothesis seems to hold .",
    "the transition between initial spreading for large initial contact angle and a receding of the contact region right from the beginning roughly coincides with the power law dependence @xmath120 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vol2](b ) , curve for large volume ) not only in the power but as well in the prefactor .",
    "the prefactor of the curve obtained from the steady drops with influx seems to be slightly below the transition found in the time simulations .",
    "further studies will be necessary to give a more detailed account .",
    "[ sec : disconc ] we have analysed a thin film evolution equation for a wetting evaporating liquid on a smooth solid substrate .",
    "we have focused on slowly evaporating small sessile droplets where thermal effects are insignificant . employing the model ,",
    "we have first studied evaporating drops as steady state solutions for the case when they are fed through a porous part of the substrate . in particular ,",
    "an asymptotic analysis has focused on the transition region between the precursor film and the bulk drop ; and a numerical continuation of steady state drops has determined the fully non - linear drop profiles as a function of the overall influx for various values of the length scale ratio @xmath51 .",
    "we have found that for large steady drops , the volume as well as the apparent contact angle decrease for increasing @xmath51 roughly as @xmath90 .",
    "this does well agree with the scaling @xmath90 determined via the asymptotic analysis .",
    "note that the mentioned logarithmic corrections to both the overlap range where the matching is done and the resulting profile slope ( apparent contact angle ) are found to have opposite effects and are too subtle for order - of - magnitude estimates .",
    "furthermore , we have employed the model to study the time evolution of freely evaporating drops that are not fed through the substrate , i.e. , the full evolution equation has been numerically integrated .",
    "thereby the time evolution of several different initial drop shapes ( for identical maximal height and volume ) has been compared .",
    "it has been shown that freely evaporating drops with different initial profiles converge onto certain trajectories in phase space . however",
    ", a direct comparison of the freely evaporating drops without influx with the evaporating steady state drops with influx has shown that the latter can not be used to approximate the former .",
    "a freely evaporating shrinking drop has always a smaller apparent contact angle than the steady drop with influx .",
    "here it has been investigated for a wide range of length scale ratios from @xmath81 to @xmath79 . however , as the differences between the two types of profiles slowly decrease with decreasing @xmath51 , further studies should scrutinise the case of even smaller @xmath51 .",
    "we have noted that in our simulations the freely evaporating drops with a similar initial geometry ( volume and height ) to steady - state drops with influx , never spread macroscopically before their contact line starts to recede and the drop shrinks .",
    "as drops undergo an initial spreading phase in many experiments , we have investigated this further and found that drops spread [ shrink ] from the beginning if their initial contact angle is larger [ smaller ] than the apparent contact angle of large evaporating drops with influx .",
    "this seems to be a very promising result that should be further scrutinised as it might have interesting consequences : ( i ) if the apparent contact angle of a steady drop with influx takes the role of an equilibrium contact angle @xmath121 , relations between the dynamic angles and the contact line velocity known from non - volatile partially wetting liquids @xcite could hold . although , this has recently been shown for the case of evaporating partially wetting liquid @xcite , it remains an open question for the case of a wetting liquid that we study here .",
    "( ii ) it might further be possible to predict the maximal drop radius and the contact angle at which the initial spreading ceases , and the turn around to the receding motion occurs .",
    "it seems plausible that the profile at turnaround might actually be identical to the steady drop profile with influx at the same volume .",
    "note that the freely evaporating drop spreads _ and _ evaporates , i.e. , the volume at turn - around does not correspond to the initial one .    note finally , that here we have studied a particular evaporation model valid for small drops in situations where thermal aspects and the dynamics in the surrounding gas phase can be neglected .",
    "however , the non - isothermal models can all be studied with a similar methodology , i.e. , the properties of steady drops with local influx can be determined and may be employed to gain a deeper understanding of the coupled transport and phase change processes .",
