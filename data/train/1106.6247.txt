    ", one needs to ensure that the behaviour of the jet finders is well understood , and that the simulations , from which the corrections are derived are good representations of the data .",
    "the siscone , anti - k@xmath1 and k@xmath1 jet finding algorithms of the fastjet package  @xcite were applied to the @xmath2=200 gev pp data .",
    "the reconstructed raw jet spectra were the same within 10@xmath3 , confirming that they have similar behaviours in this low multiplicity data .",

    "detector level pythia events have been passed through star s detector simulation and reconstruction algorithms .",
    "the resolution varies from 10 - 25@xmath3 , for 40 - 10 gev / c jets , being worse for lower jet energies .",
    "the dominant source of systematic errors on the corrected jet spectra are the uncertainties in the barrel electro - magnetic calorimeter ( bemc ) calibration .",
    "this 5@xmath3 uncertainty on the individual tower energies translates into an uncertainty on the spectra of up to 40@xmath3 .",
    "the uncertainty on the pp luminosity is an additional 7.7@xmath3 and applied separately .",
    "the inclusive jet and di - jet cross - sections have been measured using the increased statistics of the 2006 data  @xcite .",
    "a midpoint cone algorithm  @xcite with a cone radius of 0.7 , a split - merge fraction 0.5 and a seed energy of 0.5 gev was used . when hadronization and underlying event uncertainties are included the data are well described by nlo theory  @xcite .",

    ". the presence of the au nucleus may however induce additional initial and final state radiation , or result in scatterings of fragmentation particles as they escape the nucleus .",
    "these effects may result in more subtle modifications than that of the overall jet yields .",
    "for instance as changes in the fragmentation patterns or as a broadening of the di - jet @xmath7 distribution .",
    "the presence of such effects are investigated via the variables @xmath8 : the mean transverse momentum of the fragmentation products with respect to the jet axis , and @xmath6 : the mean transverse momentum kick given to di - jet pair .",
    "the @xmath9 was measured via di - hadron correlations and found to be constant at @xmath100.55 gev / c for all @xmath4  triggers measured and for both pp and d - au events at @xmath2=200 gev  @xcite .",
    "meanwhile the @xmath6 , figure  [ fig : kt]:right , is systematically higher for the d - au data than for the pp data for all @xmath4  jet and @xmath4  trigger ranges measured .",
    "this suggests that cold nuclear matter effects are small but present in the deflection / broadening of partonic trajectories but that fragmentation is unaffected .      the underlying event is defined as those particles not produced in the initial hard scatterings . in d - au collisions this underlying event is sizable compared to pp",
    "we investigate the properties of the underlying event in both pp and d - au events via the study of the transverse regions of the event relative to the reconstructed jet axes .",
    "such an analysis was first undertaken and described by cdf  @xcite .",

    "full jet reconstruction measurements at star have already given direct evidence of softening and broadening of the jet fragmentation in au - au collisions . first the jet r@xmath24 , while higher than that of single particles remains less than unity for a r=0.4 .",
    "second the r=0.2/r=0.4 ratio of reconstructed jets is less for au - au data than for pp  @xcite . taken together these results indicate that the algorithms recover less of the original partonic energy compared to the same code operating on pp data , and that this is due to particles being emitted at larger cone angles in au - au collisions than in pp .",
    "evidence that the energy loss has a path - length dependence comes from the measured di - jet coincidence rate . in this analysis  trigger \" jets are identified that contain a barrel electro - magnetic calorimeter tower with e@xmath25 5.4 gev / c and to have a reconstructed jet @xmath4  @xmath26 20 gev / c when only particles with @xmath4  @xmath26 2 gev / c are considered by the anti - k@xmath5 jet finder .",
    "this high z fragmentation requirement biases the  trigger \" jet to being preferentially emitted from the surface of the medium and/or to have only minimally interacted with the medium .",
    "this  trigger \" jet surface bias in turn maximizes the distance traversed by the recoil jet through the medium .",
    "if partonic energy loss is dependent on the path - length , the suppression of the recoil jets should be greater than that observed for the unbiased jet r@xmath24 measure . when the relative probability of reconstructing a di - jet pair in au - au is compared to that in pp it",
    "is indeed found to be suppressed by an approximate factor of 5  @xcite , i.e. a much stronger rate of suppression than observed for the inclusive jets .      to investigate this jet broadening and softening further we turn to jet - hadron correlations . in this analysis",
    "we use a  trigger \" jet ( defined as in the di - jet analysis above ) to determine the jet axis and examine the @xmath7 correlation of _ all _ charged particles in the event relative to this axis , for more details on this analysis see @xcite . if the per trigger @xmath7 distributions for pp and au - au event are plotted as a function of the associated charged particle @xmath4  striking differences , again reflecting the softening and broadening of the jet fragments , can be seen already in the raw away - side jet - hadron correlations  @xcite .",
    "these results are summarized in figures  [ fig : deltaphi ] and [ fig : daa ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : deltaphi ] shows the gaussian width of the away - side correlation in pp and au - au . for low @xmath4  associated particles the width of the au - au distributions is much broader , a complementary increase in the low @xmath4  yields is also observed  @xcite .",
    "however , this broadening could be caused by re - scattering of the initial parton , rather than a modification of the fragmentation .",
    "we therefore looked at the @xmath7 distribution of identified di - jet events in pp and au - au data , pythia events , and pythia jets embedded into au - au events .",
    "the results are shown in right plot of figure  [ fig : deltaphi ] . as can be seen",
    "the distribution is broader for the au - au data , however much of this broadening can be attributed to de - resolution of the jet axis due to the large underlying event , as demonstrated by the pyhtia+au - au event histogram .",
    "the red curve in the left plot of figure  [ fig : deltaphi ] indicates the expected width of the away - side @xmath7 distribution if the au - au fragmentation was pp - like , but with the jet axis direction smeared to reproduced the width of the @xmath7 au - au di - jet data .",
    "clearly such a smearing can not fully explain the observed broadening , and it also does not explain the enhanced low @xmath4  yields .    .",

    "the au - au data sits on a pedestal , the phenomenon traditionally known as _  the ridge \" _ , with a higher pedestal for the p+k - triggered correlations that for the @xmath0-triggered data .",

    "the intermediate @xmath4  trigger range selected for this analysis is in the region often successfully described by  recombination \" models  @xcite . however ,",
    "if the production of protons were dominated by recombination of quarks from the  bulk \" , there should be no correlated particle production with these baryons . in the nave recombination scheme this would result in",

    "such as dilution would be expected from nave recombination models due to  non - jet \" triggers dominating the baryon analyses .",
    "the p+k triggered correlations sit on a significantly increased plateau compared to those from @xmath0 triggers , when viewed in @xmath30 projections , suggesting that the protons and/or kaons experience the effects of  triangular flow \" more severely than pions .",
