    "recent years have witnessed enormous efforts in understanding glassy systems by studying a broad variety of model systems . at the same time , it has been found that various other systems like colloids , granular materials , etc .",
    "share several features of typical phenomenology of glassy systems .",
    "therefore , a common macroscopic description of glassy systems would be extremely helpful .",
    "however , unlike equilibrium thermodynamics , there is no general , well - established framework for a macroscopic description available today that works out of equilibrium .    a key role in the macroscopic description of glassy systems could be played by the concept of effective temperature @xcite .",
    "based on the fluctuation - dissipation relation ( ) @xcite , the effective temperature is supposed to govern the slow , not equilibrated degrees of freedom , while the short time dynamics and the equilibrated degrees of freedom are governed by the bath temperature .",
    "subsequent molecular dynamics simulations @xcite on a supercooled model fluid during aging or in shear flow are in agreement with this picture .",
    "however , it has been argued that non - linear generalizations of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( ) out of equilibrium could spoil the interpretation of effective temperatures from @xcite .",
    "the authors emphasize that `` physical interpretations of the several temperatures and their relation to experimental probes and to their mutual relation in non - equilibrium steady states are needed . ''",
    "( p.  2014 in @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , more recent molecular dynamics simulations @xcite found that effective temperatures should sometimes be defined from static rather than from the dynamical one , as was done in @xcite . the authors of @xcite conclude their study with a `` puzzle : when should one use static linear response and when should one use a time - dependent relation ? '' . for a review on the numerical evidence of effective temperatures",
    "see also @xcite . up to now , experimental investigations of effective temperatures in glassy systems are not conclusive .",
    "experiments on spin glasses in the aging regime @xcite and self - diffusion of granular material in a couette cell @xcite have shown some evidence in favor of the existence of an effective temperature as introduced in @xcite . in dense colloidal suspensions , very recent experiments @xcite found no deviation from the , while an effective temperature could be measured in a colloidal glass of laponite @xcite .",
    "most experiments , however , involve frequencies that are rather high compared to the inverse relaxation time .",
    "earlier experiments on an aging colloidal glass @xcite observed violations of the in electrical but not in rheological studies .    in view of these controversies , it seems appropriate to resort to simplified model systems , where the validity of effective temperature concepts can be studied in more detail .",
    "it has been found , that mean - field spin glasses with one - step replica symmetry breaking scheme do allow the definition of an effective temperature from the @xcite , while those with continuous replica symmetry breaking do not @xcite .",
    "field - theoretic calculations on the critical dynamics of spin models show , that the effective temperature defined from the does depend on the variables considered @xcite .",
    "also in the ising chain with glauber dynamics and dynamical trap models , a meaningful effective temperature can not be defined from the @xcite .",
    "a slightly different perspective was taken in @xcite , where brownian particles coupled to two heat baths at different temperatures were studied .",
    "the aim of the present study is to derive and compare different static as well as dynamic definitions of effective temperatures in these systems and discuss their range of validity .",

    "its influence on the dynamics of the particle is described by the retarded friction coefficient ( memory kernel ) @xmath5 .",
    "the other bath is kept at temperature @xmath6 .",
    "contrary to the first , slow bath , the correlation time of the second bath is small enough , so that the particle experiences an instantaneous friction described by the friction coefficient @xmath7 .",

    "formally , the model of non - markovian diffusion introduced in sec .  [ nonmarkov.sec ] can be mapped onto a system of two coupled brownian particles , each equipped with its own heat bath . in order to further simplify the analysis",
