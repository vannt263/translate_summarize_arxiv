    "the _ effective _ sequence length is the distance the bubble can explore within a time @xmath203 , i.e. , @xmath204 for the sub - diffusive dynamics expected in the glassy regime .",
    "hence , @xmath205 is the expected length of the optimal bubble within a time t. generally , we expect @xmath201 to be the upper bound of the observed bubble length @xmath200 , with @xmath206 for large @xmath203 deep in the glass phase .",
    "however below the glass transition , @xmath200 must be finite even for @xmath207 .    in fig .",
    "[ f - length](b ) , we show the coefficients of the observed logarithmic time dependence of @xmath200 for @xmath0 s throughout the range @xmath208 .",
    "also shown is the upper bound @xmath209 ( solid line ) according to ( [ l - vs - t ] ) , using the expression ( [ minh - approx ] ) for @xmath105 .",

    "+ * 2 .  aging : *",
    "perhaps the most characteristic feature of glassy dynamics is that the system `` ages '' , e.g. , the temporal fluctuation of the system depends on how long the system has evolved from some ( arbitrary ) initial condition  @xcite : the longer it has evolved , the slower it fluctuates .",
    "this is easy to understand in the context of a rough energy landscape with deep valleys and high barriers , since the longer the system evolves , the deeper the energy valley it finds , and hence the higher the barrier it will have to overcome to travel farther .",
    "this feature is in marked contrast to sub - diffusive hydrodynamic systems which are time - translationally invariant .",
    "quantitatively , we can define the aging phenomenon via the time - dependent correlation function @xmath211 , which measures how much the system changes in time @xmath212 , after first evolving for a _ waiting _ period @xmath213 from the initial condition .",
    "let us define a binary variable @xmath214 , for each base @xmath215 of the nucleotide sequence .",
    "@xmath216 takes on the value @xmath217 if base @xmath215 is open and belongs to the bubble at time @xmath203 , and the value @xmath218 if base @xmath215 is paired . the correlation function , defined as @xmath219 after averaging over @xmath220 random sequences , is a measure of the average _ self - overlap _ of the bubble at time @xmath213 and @xmath221 .",
    "a more convenient quantity to characterize is the fraction of overlap , @xmath222 , where @xmath223 is the instantaneous bubble length .     for different @xmath213 s ( from @xmath224 to @xmath225 @xmath226 monte - carlo steps )",
    "deep in the glass phase , with @xmath227 ; ( b ) scaling plot of ( a ) with @xmath212 normalized by @xmath213 .",
    "[ f - aging ] , width=297 ]    in fig .",
    "[ f - aging](a ) , we show the overlap fraction , parameterized by the different waiting time @xmath213 s for the system biased deep in the glass phase with @xmath228 .",
    "the overlap fraction clearly depends on the waiting time , illustrating the glassy nature of the dynamics .",
    "in contrast , the same quantity computed for @xmath229 ( data not shown ) gives no statistically significant dependence on @xmath213 . to characterize more quantitatively the behavior , we re - plot in fig .",
    "[ f - aging](b ) the curves in ( a ) with @xmath212 normalized by @xmath213 .",
    "we find these curves to collapse reasonably onto a single master curve which exhibits a weak kink at @xmath230 .",
    "a naive explanation of this behavior is that for @xmath231 , the bubble stays approximately within the energy valley found at time @xmath213 , while for @xmath232 , the bubble makes excursion far away from the valley .",
    "for the one - dimensional `` trap '' model , it was shown rigorously  @xcite that @xmath233 indeed scales as a function of @xmath234 , even though the largest trap time actually scales sub - linearly with @xmath213 .",
    "this behavior can be understood in terms of the particle making multiple returns to the original valley after escaping it  @xcite , as manifested by the slow decay shown in fig .  [ f - aging](b ) for @xmath232 .",
    "in this study we investigated the thermodynamic and dynamic behaviors of twist - induced denaturation bubbles in a long , random sequence of dna .",
    "the small bubbles associated with weak twist are delocalized , e.g. , they flicker in and out of existence according to the boltzmann distribution and are independent of the dna sequence",
    ". the bubbles increase in lengths upon increase in the applied torque .",
    "when the largest bubbles reach a critical size @xmath235 which is of the order of a few tens of bases , the bubbles become localized to at - rich segments which occur statistically in a long random sequence . according to the parameters",
    "@xcite taken at @xmath21 with @xmath71 = 1~{\\tt m}$ ] , the localization `` transition '' occurs at @xmath236 , which is @xmath237 of the torque needed for bulk denaturation @xmath1 . in the localized regime , the bubbles exhibit `` aging '' and move along the double helix sub - diffusively , with continuously varying dynamic exponents .",
    "all of the results are obtained under the single - bubble approximation .",
    "thermodynamically , we expect this approximation to be valid for dna sequences of several thousand bases or less .",
    "this is due to the strongly cooperative nature of bubble formation , as manifested in the large initiation energy @xmath26 .",
    "the single bubble description of dynamics is further restricted by the finite life time of the bubble : even at length scales where the single - bubble approximation is appropriate thermodynamically , the bubble may annihilate and reappear elsewhere in the sequence , effectively performing long - distance hops .",
    "experimental knowledge of the bubble life time in the presence of an applied twist is needed to estimate the crossover time to the long - distance hopping regime .",
    "qualitatively , we expect these bubbles to have much longer life times than the thermally denatured bubbles , since the applied twist plays the role of an energy barrier preventing bubble annihilation .",
    "finally , we note that bubble localization characterized in this study is a reflection of the statistical background present in long random nucleotide sequences",
    ". this background traps the bubble kinetically if the bubble size becomes sufficiently large .",
    "thus , to localize denaturation bubbles at appropriate locations specified by designed sequences ( e.g. , promoters or replication origins ) for biological functions , it is necessary to operate away from the localized regime , i.e. , below the onset of localization .",
