    "observations both of the galaxy population and the intergalactic medium probed along sightlines to these distant ` lighthouses ' have suggested that the number density of neutral hydrogen clouds rises sharply at @xmath16 , resulting in absorption in distant spectra , and so fewer galaxies observable in the lyman-@xmath17 transition of hydrogen @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , increasingly precise measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation have measured the extent to which it has been modified by neutral hydrogen along the line of sight , constraining the thompson optical depth to reionization to @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "if interpreted as arising from a step - wise transition from neutral to ionized intergalactic medium , this corresponds to a reionization redshift of @xmath19 .",
    "together , these constraints suggest a reionization process that probably began around @xmath20 and proceeded rapidly , leading to a universe with a mean neutral fraction @xmath21 per cent by @xmath22 .",
    "given these constraints on the history of reionization , an inevitable question arises concerning its driving force .",
    "the contribution of ionizing photons from agn is too small to either reionize the universe or maintain that state against hydrogen recombination , and thus star forming galaxies are believed to power the process . however",
    "the number density of observable star forming galaxies in the distant universe falls sharply with cosmic time . extrapolating the observed luminosity distribution of colour - selected , ultraviolet - luminous galaxies to below observable limits",
    ", it has been established that this population is likely sufficient to reionize the universe but only marginally so @xcite .",
    "difficulties remain ; it is unclear whether a sufficient fraction of ionizing photons are capable of escaping the dust and nebular gas within the galaxy in which they are emitted , or whether a sufficient number of small galaxies ( predicted from the faint - end slope of observed luminosity functions , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and poorly constrained at @xmath14 ) exist to power cosmic reionisation .",
    "one reason for such uncertainty is the unfortunate necessity of extrapolation below the limits of observational data .",
    "only a few , rare @xmath23 galaxies are bright enough for detailed spectroscopic analysis .",
    "observations of high redshift galaxies are typically limited to their broadband colours in the rest - frame ultraviolet ( and sometimes optical ) and perhaps a measurement of particularly strong emission lines ( such as lyman-@xmath17 at 1216 ; e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "given a measured rest - frame 1500  flux continuum density , usually derived from photometry in a broad bandpass , the number of ionizing photons shortwards of 912  ( the ionization limit of hydrogen or ` lyman break ' ) must be inferred ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this ` lyman continuum ' flux is estimated through the use of stellar population synthesis models , fitted to the available data . for a stellar population of known age , metallicity and ultraviolet flux",
    ", the ionizing photon flux can be reliably estimated .",
    "however difficulties arise when any of these properties are unknown .",
    "a young starburst will contain a larger proportion of hot , massive stars than an older one and so emit more ionizing photons for a given 1500  continuum measurement .",
    "by contrast , a stellar population that has formed stars continuously over its lifetime will show an ultraviolet spectral energy distribution ( sed ) to which both young stars and older sources contribute , resulting in a modified but far more stable ionizing photon - to - continuum ratio . at low metallicities , different stellar evolution pathways , including those which result from binary star interactions or rotation , become increasingly important - again resulting in a modified ionizing photon output .",
    "while some of these variations can be inferred from stellar population modelling , this has traditionally been tuned to match the properties of the local galaxy distribution - largely comprising mature galaxies and stellar populations with a near - solar average metallicity .    as discussed in @xcite , the general effect of binary evolution and rotation",
    "is to cause a population of stars to appear bluer at an older age than predicted by single - star models .",
    "this increase in the lifetime over which star forming galaxies emit hard ultraviolet spectra may well present an explanation for the observed high oiii / h@xmath24 emission line ratios in the sub - solar , low mass star forming galaxies of the distant universe @xcite , although the evidence for these at intermediate redshifts ( @xmath25 ) and whether instead they may represent a shift in nitrogen abundance is still under discussion ( e.g. see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "its significance for the epoch of reionization is obvious : a blue spectrum will emit more ionizing photons for a given 1500  luminosity than a corresponding red spectrum . since 1500  ( rest frame ) observations , modified by a model - derived flux ratio , are most frequently used to constrain the ionizing population",
    ", it is thus critical to examine the effects of evolutionary pathways on derived constraints on reionization .    in this paper",
    "we consider uncertainties in stellar evolution and population synthesis and how these affect the predicted ionizing flux from distant star forming galaxies , and the interpretation of the observed galaxy luminosity function , in the context of observational constraints . in section",

    "all magnitudes are quoted on the ab system .",
    "population and spectral synthesis codes are commonly used in astrophysics when a model for a stellar population is required .",
    "these combine theoretical ( atmosphere and evolution ) models or empirical spectra of individual stars , assuming some initial mass function ( imf ) and stellar population age , and process the resultant emission through dust and gas screens to calculate an ` observed ' spectrum @xcite .",
    "it is important not to overlook the assumptions that go into these models .",
    "a comprehensive analysis of some of the uncertainties in population synthesis reveals there is still much to improve in population synthesis , refining models to address a number of physical processes that are currently not included .",
    "as @xcite discuss , population synthesis is currently a subject in a state of flux .",
    "not only are the stellar atmosphere models being revised to better match the spectra of observed stars across a broad range of metallicities , stellar evolution models are also undergoing an unprecedented increase in accuracy .",
    "factors that affect the output of population synthesis include the effects of mass - loss rates , stellar rotation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and interacting binaries which must be evaluated using detailed modelling of stellar evolution , and which are affected in turn by the initial mass function and metallicity of the input stellar population .",
    "each of the widely - used , publically available population synthesis codes , which include starburst99 @xcite and bpass  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see below ) treats the above factors in a different way .",
    "an investigation of alternate implementations , stellar population assumptions and their effects is thus warranted .",
    "the binary population and spectral synthesis ( bpass ) models are a set of publically available stellar population synthesis models which are constructed by combining stellar evolution models with synthetic stellar spectra .",
    "detailed stellar evolution models , described in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* in prep ) , are combined with the latest stellar atmosphere models and a synthetic stellar population generated according to both an initial mass function and a distribution of binary separation distances , to produce a stellar population ( see * ? ? ?",

    "when only single star evolution pathways are considered , the resultant output spectra are very similar to those of the well - known starburst99 code , as figure [ fig : s99comp1 ] demonstrates . at differing metallicities and ages , for different imfs and when binary evolution pathways are included ,",
    "the treatment of stellar population effects in the two codes , and hence the composite spectra they produce , diverge .",

    "we also show an evolutionary track constructed using starburst99 and either the original padova stellar tracks or the recent geneva - group stellar models , a subset of which incorporate stars with a rotation parameter @xmath30.,scaledwidth=49.0% ]    interacting binaries provide a more moderate increase in ionizing flux but also reduce the rate at which it decreases in older stellar populations .",
    "the three key effects of binary interactions are : removal of the hydrogen envelope in primary stars - forming more hot helium or wolf - rayet stars ; the transfer of mass to secondary stars increasing their mass and rejuvenating them ; and finally the generation of massive stars from stellar mergers @xcite .",
    "the first of these , enhanced mass - loss for the primary stars in binaries , does little to increase the total ionizing flux but does allow harder ionizing photons to exist at later times than expected from a single star population , beyond @xmath3110 myrs .",
    "the transfer of mass to secondary stars and binary mergers result in a more top heavy effective mass function for the stellar population , as well as creating more massive stars at later ages than would be expected for a single star population .",
    "these are the major reasons for the enhanced ionizing flux at late times seen for binaries in figure [ fig : s99comp1 ] , and causes the slower decline rate for the ionizing flux beyond a few myrs .",
    "figure [ fig : s99comp1 ] also illustrates the effect of stellar rotation on the predicted ionizing fluxes .",
    "rotation tends to increase the flux at all ages but the form of evolution with stellar population age remains the same as in the non - rotating case .",
    "this is because the primary effects of rotation are to extend main - sequence life times and also to generate stars that are more luminous and hotter during their main - sequence evolution .    when mass is transferred in a binary system , so too is angular momentum .",
    "this spin - up of stars by this transfer can result in the rotational mixing of its layers , allowing the more efficient burning of hydrogen in its interior . at solar metallicity",
    "this can mix fresh hydrogen into main - sequence stars and rejuvenation of their age .",
    "however stellar winds are strong in such stars and so they quickly spin down . as stellar winds",
    "weaken at lower metallicities , the stars can remain rapidly rotating over their entire main - sequence lifetimes and evolve as if they are fully mixed .",
    "this quasi - homogeneous evolution ( qhe ) is significant at high stellar masses ( @xmath3220m@xmath1 ) and low metallicities ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "we have investigated the effect of qhe on stellar populations and the production of long gamma - ray bursts in eldridge et al .",
    "( 2011 ) and eldridge & stanway ( 2012 ) .",
    "others have also investigated the importance of qhe @xcite in stellar populations .",
    "this extends the stellar lifetime and causes the star to become hotter as it evolves rather than cooler .    in our fiducial population of the entire populations",
    "only approximately 0.04 per cent of the stars experience qhe .",
    "the fraction of rotationally mixed stars increases at high masses , ranging from 10 to 20 per cent of the stars above 20m@xmath34 .",
    "as discussed in the above papers , we have constrained the number of qhe - affected stars by ensuring that the relative rates of type ib / c ( hydrogen - free ) to type ii ( hydrogen - rich ) supernovae reproduces the observed trend with metallicity .",
    "when the first supernova occurs in a binary we calculate whether the system is disrupted or not as discussed in eldridge et al .",
    "( 2008 , 2011 ) .",
    "if the system is unbound , the secondary continues its evolution as a single star ; otherwise , the remnant mass is estimated and the evolution continues with either a white dwarf , neutron star or black hole as a companion . again mass transfer can occur but any possible luminous variability from the compact object accreting mass is not currently included .",
    "we find that only approximately 25 per cent of binary systems survive the first supernova .",
    "the models in use here comprise version 2.0 of the bpass  model dataset .",
    "we employ stellar evolution and atmosphere models with a metallicity mass fraction ranging from @xmath35 to 0.040 .",
    "these metallicities correspond to oxygen abundances spanning log(o / h)+12=7.6 to 9.0 , where @xmath36 ( log(o / h)+12=8.8 ) is conventionally assumed to be the value for the present - day cosmic abundance of local galactic massive stars as discussed by nieva & przybilla ( 2012 ) .",
    "this is preferable to using the solar composition of asplund et al .",
    "( 2009 ) which is closer to a log(o / h)+12=8.7 or @xmath37 .",
    "this is because the sun with a 4.5 billion - year age is a poor indicator for the composition of massive stars that formed much more recently .",
    "a broken power - law is used for the initial mass function ( imf ) in our standard models , with a slope of -1.3 between 0.1 and 0.5@xmath38 and -2.35 at masses above this , extending to 100@xmath38 for the models used in this study .",
    "the shallow slope below a stellar mass of 0.5m@xmath1 biases our models towards the more massive stellar population , and is now routinely adopted in stellar population synthesis models including the default parameters for starburst99 .",
    "the slope above the break and upper mass limit match those of the salpeter imf .",
    "we note that recent observations have provided evidence for stellar masses above 100m@xmath1 in nearby clusters @xcite , and we consider the effects of extending the initial mass function to higher limits in section [ sec : imfs ] .",
    "we assume an initial parameter distribution for the binary population that is flat in the logarithm of the period from 1 day to 10000 days .",
    "we also assume a flat distribution in binary mass ratio , defined as @xmath39 . both of these are consistent with the observations of @xcite .",
    "we compute binary evolution models from 0.1 to 100@xmath38 however we only count the mass of the secondary as a star if its initial mass is greater than 0.1@xmath38 , otherwise it is considered a brown dwarf and does not contribute to the total stellar mass .",
    "this assumed initial distribution leads to approximately two thirds of binary systems interacting in some way during their lifetime .",
    "we follow mass transfer between the primary to the second star , assuming that the secondary star can only accrete at a rate limited by its thermal timescale .",
    "the remaining mass is lost from the system .",
    "we also account for qhe in the method outlined in eldridge et al .",
    "if a secondary star accretes more than 5 per cent of its original mass then we assume it is rejuvenated and restart its evolution at its final mass at a later time .",
    "if the metallicity is @xmath40 and the star is more massive than 20m@xmath34 then we assume it evolves full mixed during its hydrogen burning lifetime and experiences qhe . while there are many uncertainty parameters in binary stellar evolution , as discussed in our previous work and the extensive literature on this topic , we do not vary these to achieve a better fit to data but work with a fiducial parameter set .",
    "these lead to a synthetic binary population that reproduces most observational tests for a stellar population and are described in detail in eldridge et al .",
    "( 2008 , 2011 ) and eldridge & stanway ( 2009 , 2012 ) . the comparison of the v2.0 models against the same observational data will be presented in eldridge et al .",

    "the baseline models track the evolution of a coeval stellar population ( as discussed in the next section ) , but can be combined to evaluate the effect of continuous star formation , multiple star formation epochs , or a more complex star formation history ( see section [ sec : sfh ] ) .",
    "they comprise both a model set with a binary distribution matching observational constraints as described above , and a single star model set in which the stars evolve in isolation , with mass loss via stellar winds .",
    "changes in the fraction of binary interactions can be accommodated by producing a weighted mean of these models if required .",
    "the key parameter required for calculations of the reionization process is , in principle , a simple one : the flux of photons with sufficient energy to ionize hydrogen ( i.e. with wavelengths @xmath41 , a spectral region known as the lyman continuum ) arising from a stellar population .",
    "this quantity is usually estimated for a given stellar population simply from its continuum luminosity density in the far - ultraviolet , at around @xmath42  in the galaxy rest frame .    in figure [",

    "we adopt this as representative as it reproduces the moderately sub - solar , but non - negligible , metallicities inferred for the high redshift ( @xmath44 ) galaxy population @xcite , and we defer discussion of metallicity effects to section [ sec : z ] . in each case",
    "the same far - ultraviolet luminosity is generated by stellar populations with similar total stellar mass , but the flux shortwards of the lyman break at 912  differs significantly .",

    "the photon flux remains virtually constant at ages above @xmath3110myr in both the single and binary star evolution path cases as the oldest stars fade in the ultraviolet and are replaced . throughout the lifetime of the star formation event , however , the binary star populations produce a higher number of ionizing photons , exceeding the single star population flux by 50 - 60 per cent in this @xmath47 example ( see section [ sec : z ] for metallicity effects ) .",
    "while the continuous star formation case yields a highly stable photon flux that depends only on star formation rate ( after an initial establishment period ) rather than stellar mass , it may not be a wholly realistic scenario for all distant galaxies . for galaxies in which star formation",
    "is triggered by merger events , or the sudden accretion of gas clouds from the igm , which drive winds which quench their own star formation , or which have a small gas supply at the onset of star formation , star formation could plausibly be a short lived phase ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ".    the star formation history in such systems is usually parameterized as an initial abrupt star formation event , followed by ongoing star formation , the rate of which declines exponentially with a characteristic time - scale , @xmath50 .",
    "the continuous star formation scenario represents one extreme of such models ( @xmath51 ) , while the other extreme ( @xmath52 ) is an instantaneous starburst , in which all stars are formed simultaneously and thereafter evolve without further star formation .    in figure",
    "[ fig : spec_sfh ] we show a comparison between the synthetic spectra produced by continuous star formation and a starburst scenario at a stellar population age of 100myr , using either single or binary synthesis at @xmath47 .",
    "by contrast with the continuous star formation event , an ageing starburst emits very few ionizing photons , despite a still healthy 1500  continuum .",
    "this is significant for the inferences drawn from the high redshift galaxy population .",
    "galaxies at @xmath53 are typically only detected longwards of the 1216  lyman-@xmath17 feature , and their luminosities are measured around 1500  in the rest frame . as figure [ fig : spec_sfh ] demonstrates , for a young starburst , this can lead to substantial ambiguity in the estimated 912  and ionizing photon flux .    a suggestion that starburst events at high redshift might be short - lived",
    "can be found in the very high specific star formation rates of lyman break galaxies at high redshift .",

    "the contribution of these short - lived bursts to the ionizing flux has largely been ignored in the past , on the basis that single star models in particular show a rapid decline in luminosity within 10myr of the initial burst . in figure",

    "both single star and binary evolution synthesis models do indeed show rapid , order of magnitude , drop in ionizing photon flux over the first 10myr after star formation .",

    "the binary models prolong the period over which hot stars dominate the spectrum . as a result",
    ", the ionizing photon flux declines far less rapidly for binary synthesis models than that of a single star population at the same metallicity , and the ratio between the two rises to a factor of 100 at an age of 30myr .",

    "we have explored how this flux depends on the history and properties of star formation in a galaxy , and considered the implications of the resultant uncertainty for the reionization of the universe at the end of the cosmic dark ages .",
    "our main numerical results are presented in table [ tab : summary ] and can be summarised as follows :    1 .",
    "a stellar population undergoing constant star formation and incorporating binaries produces a higher hydrogen - ionizing flux than that of a population assumed to evolve purely through single star evolution pathways .",
    "the excess in the binary case is @xmath3160 per cent of the single star flux at modestly sub - solar ( 0.1 - 0.2@xmath7 ) metallicities .",
    "single age stellar populations observed post - starburst show rapid evolution in their ionizing photon flux , which is generally lower than in the constant star formation case .",
    "however , binary pathways prolongue the period over which a starburst generates an ionizing photon flux , with photon production rates @xmath69 times higher at ages of 10 - 30myr than in the single star case .",
    "3 .   stellar populations show a strong trend in ionizing flux production with metallicity ( in the range 0.05 - 2@xmath7 ) , with low metallicity populations producing a higher ionizing flux at a given star formation rate . for a galaxy forming 1m@xmath1yr@xmath2 , observed at @xmath3myr after the onset of star formation",
    ", we predict a production rate of photons capable of ionizing hydrogen , @xmath4s@xmath2 at @xmath5 and @xmath6s@xmath2 at 0.1@xmath7 assuming our standard imf , as shown in table [ tab : summary ] . at solar and super - solar metallicities ,",
    "binary pathways have very little effect on the photon production rate .",
    "4 .   the ultraviolet spectral slope",
    ", @xmath24 is an unreliable indicator of ionizing photon flux , showing strong dependence on recent star formation history and metallicity , as well as being subject to uncertainties in the dust extinction law .",
    "young starbursts with relatively little gas and dust would straightforwardly match the steep spectral slopes ( @xmath70 ) seen in high redshift galaxy samples .",
    "the production of photons capable of ionizing heii maintains a constant ratio to the hydrogen - ionizing flux for ongoing star formation , although this takes longer to become established at solar and super - solar metallicities than at low metallicity ( @xmath71myr compared to a fewmyr ) . for ageing single - burst stellar populations ,",
    "the ratios of these photons show strong variation with stellar population age .",
    "the ionizing flux required to maintain the ionization state of the intergalactic medium yields a critical star formation rate dependent on star formation history and metallicity . in the case of continuous star formation ,",
    "binary models produce similar estimates for the critical star formation rate for reionization to older models including single stars .",
    "however we note that the star formation history can change the required time- and volume - averaged star formation rate to reach the ionizing photon threshold by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "we find that , assuming constant star formation , currently observed galaxy luminosity functions must be integrated down to a lower absolute magnitude limit of @xmath72 to maintain the ionization limit of the universe at @xmath14 ( depending on stellar metallicity , assuming @xmath73 ) . beyond this redshift , or at lower escape fractions , maintaining the ionization balance of the universe , let alone the reionization process , becomes challenging . in the case of young starbursts ,",
    "doing so becomes challenging at redshifts as low as @xmath74 .",
    "8 .   assuming the constant star formation case",
    ", we find that escape fractions @xmath75 ranging from a few per cent ( at sub - solar metallicities ) up to 24 per cent ( at solar metallicity ) are required to recover the ionizing flux observed in the intergalactic medium at @xmath10 , based on observed lyman break galaxy luminosity functions .",
    "lower escape fractions by a factor of 2 - 3 required at metallicities of a tenth solar , relative to solar .    while the models discussed here necessarily explore only a subset of possible characteristics of star formation in the distant universe ,",
    "it is clear that the interpretation of 1500  continuum luminosities as indicative of ionizing flux , or indeed of other spectral features such as heii or civ emission , should be approached with caution .",
    "the very limited observational constraints on these underlying characteristics of the stellar population can give rise to almost an order of magnitude uncertainty in the ionizing flux , and this is most strongly affected by the star formation history . if a rising fraction of the lyman break galaxy population is powered by very young starbursts with increasing redshifts , then currently observed galaxy populations may struggle to reproduce the ionizing flux necessary to maintain ionization balance at @xmath23 .",
    "nonetheless , it is both interesting and encouraging that , given constant star formation , extrapolation of the existing galaxy population to a reasonable lower mass limit confirms that lyman break galaxies are capable of sustaining the ionization balance of the intergalactic medium at @xmath76 , and perhaps as high as @xmath77 , without invoking exceptionally high escape fractions , steep luminosity functions or low , population iii metallicities .",
