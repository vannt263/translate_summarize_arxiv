    "below 4.6 k , the field - cooled ( fc ) magnetization also exhibits a small cusp and then remains almost temperature - independent . in fig .",
    "[ dcgd ] , we show that the dc magnetization is strongly history - dependent : data were measured following an initial zero - field cooling to 2 k and warming in a 50 oe field from 2 k to various temperatures , @xmath8. for instance , after zfc measurement from 2 k to 2.6 k , the sample was cooled with applied field back to 2 k , after which the magnetization data was acquired upon warming from 2 k to 3.4 k. therefore , the red - line in fig .",

    "@xmath33 is the applied magnetic field , above which the irreversibility phenomenon of spin - glass should be fully suppressed .",

    "however , it is not clear what causes the difference in the exponent values .    compared with a long - range magnetic ordering , which can be viewed as a thermal equilibrium state during the time scale of measurement ,",
    "a spin - glass is not in such an equilibrium state .",
    "therefore , the magnetic behavior will depend on the frequency of measurement due to the system s limited ability to respond to the changing applied field .",
    "the cusp - temperature in the real part of the ac susceptibility increases by about 0.16 k upon increasing the measurement frequency from 10 hz to 10000 hz .",

    "although the dc magnetization data and the frequency dependence of ac magnetization are consistent with a spin - glass - type freezing of the magnetic moments in i - gd - cd , more evidence is required to rule out superparamagnetic - type blocking , or cluster glass , behavior . a convincing way to distinguish between these possibilities is to look at the third order , non - linear magnetic susceptibility , @xmath10 , in the vicinity of spin - freezing / blocking temperature@xcite .",

    "we point out that the peak temperature in @xmath10 for i - gd - cd is 4.3 k , a value that is 0.3 k lower than the @xmath30 value from the dc magnetization .",
    "this small discrepancy in temperatures possibly results from a different thermometry configuration in the qd ppms where ac susceptibility was measured . for the current study",

    "whereas the data just presented for i - gd - cd is consistent with classic spin - glass behavior , for i - tb - cd and i - dy - cd , the canonical cusp - shaped spin - glass signature in magnetization data is replaced by a broad maximum in both zfc and fc data with the irreversibility appearing at a significantly higher temperature ( fig .",
    "[ dctbdy ] ) .",
    "similar behavior was observed in the @xmath0-mg - cd quasicrystal system and explained by the presence of magnetic impurities that due to slight oxidation of the surface of the sample@xcite .",
    "after annealing at 200@xmath4c for two days , the dc magnetization data for both i - tb - cd and i - ho - cd remain the same , even though a thin layer of oxidation appeared on the sample s surface .",

    "sample inhomogeneity that causes non - cusp like feature in other spin glass systems@xcite , if exists in i - tb - cd and i - dy - cd , can not be removed by annealing at 200@xmath4c .    in fig .",

    "this may indicate that only at temperatures that are lower than @xmath30 , do the magnetic moments become fully `` frozen '' .",

    "the existence of i-@xmath0-cd ( @xmath0 = y , gd - tm ) allows for the study of systematic trends across this binary , local - moment - bearing quasicrystal series . as shown in fig .",
    "[ xray ] , there is a standard lanthanide contraction associated with changing @xmath0 . despite possible slight change in stoichiometry , there is no clear difference between i - gd - cd and i - tm - cd in terms of strain and phason strain , or in other words , sample quality .    for i - gd - cd , we have presented data that support the identification of @xmath30 as @xmath32 , the spin glass freezing temperature .",
    "these data include : ( 1 ) a cusp in dc magnetization ; ( 2 ) a frequency - dependent freezing temperature ; ( 3 ) a narrow third order magnetic susceptibility , @xmath10 , at the freezing temperature ; ( 4 ) a broad maximum in temperature - dependent specific heat with the maxima temperature somewhat higher than the cusp temperature in dc magnetization .",
    "according to the general understanding of the experimental characteristics of spin - glasses@xcite , i - gd - cd can be considered to be a spin - glass below @xmath32 = 4.6 k. unfortunately , we were unable to obtain as extensive sets of data for the rest of the i-@xmath0-cd ( @xmath0 = tb - tm ) series , especially @xmath10 .",
    "in discussion of the magnetization features , i - tb - cd and i - dy - cd are of special interest for their non - cusp - like zfc dc magnetization data . however , in view of the similarity in resistance ( see appendix ) and specific heat data , it is likely that neither i - tb - cd nor i - dy - cd exhibit long - range magnetic ordering .",
    "further investigations of i - tb - cd and i - dy - cd are needed to elucidate the origin of this non - standard spin - glass - like behavior in the magnetization .",

    "ac magnetization measurements below 2 k are needed , which is currently beyond our instrumental capability .",
    "it is worth pointing out that although broadened maxima , rather than @xmath57-like peaks , were observed in the specific heat measurements , the maximum temperatures are close to , if not equal to , @xmath30 .",
    "whereas in canonical spin - glass systems , the broad maximum in specific heat often exceeds the freezing temperature , @xmath32 , by about 20%-50%@xcite .    in a series of iso - structural rare earth based compounds , systematic trends in the physical properties",

    "in this study , we presented detailed structural , thermodynamic and transport measurements on i-@xmath0-cd ( @xmath0 = y , gd - tm ) grown via the solution growth method . structurally , the clear trend of diffraction peaks broadening as a function of @xmath23 indicates that frozen - in phason strain is the key mechanism for structural disorder in these quasicrystallne samples .",

    "the resistivity of quasicrystalline material is nearly temperature - independent , or decreases weakly with increasing temperature . because of the high resistivity of quasicrystals , a small amount of conducting impurity in / on the sample is sufficient to result in significant changes in measured resistance .    in our initial attempts to measure the electric resistance of i-@xmath0-cd ,",
    "a standard four - probe technique was used and pt wires were attached to an as - grown sample like shown in fig .  [ diagram](b ) . in fig .",
    "[ cd](a ) , the temperature - dependent resistance of as - grown i - tb - cd is presented ( green triangles ) .",
    "a sizeable residual resistance ratio ( rrr ) of about 4.5 was obtained , which is distinct from known quasicrystal behavior@xcite .",
    "however , the shape of the observed resistance can result from measuring a nearly temperature - independent resistor ( the quasicrystal sample ) connected in series and in parallel with a highly conducting metal , in this case , cd .",
    "we tried to remove the residual cd in the following way .",
    "the sample is sealed in a long quartz tube under vacuum , in which the sample is held at 200@xmath4c while the other end of the tube is held at room temperature . due to its high vapour pressure , cd can be easily removed from the sample by this heat treatment . in preparing the sample for resistance measurements , polishing as the first step could remove residue surface cd and the heat treatment , as the second step ,",
    "could remove part of the remaining cd that was trapped in exposed dendritic grain boundaries .",
    "after the polished sample went through the heat treatment for 3 days , a nearly temperature - independent resistance was indeed observed , as shown in fig .",
    "[ cd](a ) by black squares .",
    "however , as illustrated by the inset of fig .",
    "[ cd](b ) , the resistance of i - tb - cd still decreases below about 100 k , and a clear magnetic field dependence of this low - temperature resistance emerges . for clarity , the resistance of elemental cd was also measured .",
    "the resistance sample of cd was prepared by pressing an elemental cd droplet to reduce the thickness .",
    "a rrr of about 2200 was observed [ fig .",
    "[ cd](b ) ] .",
    "the magnetoresistance increases at low temperatures as expected in general for a simple , high purity , metal , and follows kohler s rule@xcite .",
    "the resemblance of the low - temperature magnetoresistance of i - tb - cd to that of cd suggests that even after polishing and the heat treatment , cd that is trapped within the qusicrystal might still affect the resistance data .",
    "therefore , it is likely that , despite efforts to eliminate cd , the features observed are a combination of intrinsic quasicrystal properties plus a minor amount of conducting metal .    in fig .",
    "[ resistivity ] , the normalized resistance data are measured in zero - field and 90 koe for all i-@xmath0-cd samples shown .",
    "the room - temperature resistivity of i-@xmath0-cd quasicrystals is approximately 300 @xmath14 cm .",
    "compared with other quasicrystal systems , this is close to that in i-@xmath0-mg - zn@xcite and i - yb - cd@xcite and is an order of magnitude smaller than in al - pd - mn and al - cu - fe@xcite .",
    "if an assumption of a low intrinsic magnetoresistance of quasicrystals is made , it seems that i - gd - cd and i - ho - cd might be the best representation for single phase quasicrystal behavior .",
    "the resistance if i - gd - cd and i - ho - cd tends to increase with decreasing temperature . at 1.8 k , the magnetoresistance is small , and negative for i - ho - cd and positive for i - gd - cd . in other quasicrystal systems ,",
    "both positive and negative magnetoresistance has been observed@xcite . besides the negative slope of zero - field resistance at room temperature ,",
    "the resistance of i-@xmath0-cd also exhibits a broad dome at lower temperature , for example , @xmath56100 k for i - tb - cd and @xmath5640 k for i - gd - cd .",
    "although this feature might be affected by metallic cd , similar dome - shape resistances had been observed in many other quasicrystals as well and was explained by weak localization with strong spin - orbit coupling@xcite and competing inelastic scattering in the presence of weak localization@xcite .",
    "it worth pointing out that the existence of such a broad maxima was shown to be closely related to the sample preparation method and the sample quality@xcite .",
    "in addition , at low temperatures , a small upturn or saturation in resistance exists , which sometimes appears as well in other aforementioned quasicrystals that exhibit a broad dome in resistance . the temperature at which the upturn or saturation occurs does not match dc magnetization features .",
    "it is important to point out , though , that no sharp feature can be found in any of the data sets shown in fig .",
    "[ resistivity ] that can be associated with long - range magnetic ordering .",
    "this is consistent with the lack of @xmath57-shaped features in specific heat measurements . for spin - glass systems",
