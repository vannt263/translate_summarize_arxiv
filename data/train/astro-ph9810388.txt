    "differences for chemical consistent vs. pure solar metallicity models on the one hand and different  explosion energies ( model a vs. model c by woosley & weaver @xcite ) on the other hand are small compared to differences due to the variation of the star formation rate characterizing our spectral galaxy types sa @xmath94 sd .",

    "the small error bars attached to the data points indicate that these deviations can not be due to observational errors .",
    "it is seen that in two of the four cases ( qso 0216 + 0803 and 0528 - 2505 ) only the typical snii elements si and s show abundances higher than those of our sa model whereas the iron group elements fe , zn and cr which have important sni contributions are * not * enhanced .",

    "some large [ fe / h ] values observed in dla systems can now be reached with the salpeter imf but then , in turn , some low abundance data fall outside the region outlined by our models .",
    "this drawback can be compensated by lowering the star formation rate of sd galaxies . because the sfr of sd galaxies is constant",

    "very small sfrs are characteristic for _ low surface brightness galaxies _ ( lsbs ) and hence we conclude that a few observed dla systems with particularly low abundances could be either late type spirals with a lower than average sfr or else lsb galaxies . as discussed in the previous subsection an extremely low element abundance measured in dla systems could also be due to a large ( unknown ) impact parameter",
