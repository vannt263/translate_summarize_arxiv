    "considerable research efforts have been dedicated to improving detection sensitivity by fabricating devices with higher resonance frequencies , lower damping rates ( high quality factors ) and larger coupling between electrical and mechanical degrees of freedom .",
    "the problem of detecting the quantum state of a macroscopic mechanical resonator gave rise to several measuring schemes , proposed @xcite as well as realized @xcite .",
    "continuous improvements in device fabrication in combination with new techniques for cooling mechanical motion @xcite have pushed the sensitivity threshold to the quantum limit @xcite .",
    "the use of superconducting devices , in particular , superconducting qubits to detect and control the mechanical motion is in focus of modern research @xcite .",
    "it gives rise to a growing interest in techniques of coupling nems to superconducting circuits .",

    "the same gate voltage can be used to excite the mechanical motion which is detected from the change of d.c .",
    "transport properties of the device @xcite . without superconductors ,",
    "this scheme has been successfully realized for a metallic single - electron transistor @xcite and for a coulomb - blockaded quantum dot in an ultra - clean carbon nanotube ( cnt ) @xcite .",
    "the results revealed high resonance frequencies , reaching gigahertzs , and unprecedented quality factors of the order of @xmath0 .",
    "these devices can be made superconducting by connecting them to superconducting leads and providing sufficiently large coupling between the states of the lead and device .",
    "we have successfully realized josephson junctions based on the ultra - clean cnt .",
    "the supercurrent observed demonstrates a pronounced gate - voltage sensitivity that indicates a well - developed coulomb blockade @xcite .",
    "a very interesting proposal that combines josephson dynamics and mechanical resonator has been recently put forward by gothenburg collaboration @xcite .",
    "the authors consider an ideal ballistic cnt between two superconducting leads biased at voltage @xmath1 .",
    "owing to josephson relation , the current in the nanotube oscillates at frequency @xmath2 .",
    "the authors notice that in external magnetic field this gives rise to an oscillating lorentz force .",
    "if the frequency matches the frequency of the mechanical resonator , the force excites mechanical motion which rectifies the josephson current enabling the observation of the effect in d.c . electric response of the junction .",
    "one would observe a narrow current peak in @xmath3 characteristics of the device .",
    "the same mechanism is responsible for fiske steps @xcite : the difference is that in fiske experiments the resonance is electrical rather than mechanical .",
    "this provides us motivation for the present theoretical study where we address superconducting nems where a mechanical resonator is integrated with a superconducting circuit element , a josephson junction .",
    "the focus of this work is to describe the techniques of driving and detecting mechanical motion using superconducting current and to explore the coupled dynamics of the oscillator displacement and superconducting phase difference .",
    "while the study is general for any type of oscillating nanowire , for the purpose of illustration and for concrete estimations we refer to one of the more successful nems devices : a suspended metallic cnt resonator connected to the metallic leads .",
    "we have fabricated and studied such devices .",
    "studies of cnt josephson junctions have shown that their josephson energy can be modulated by the gate - induced charge on the cnt . in this paper",

    "it is our conclusion that the mechanical response in our devices should be small modifying the current on the scale of @xmath4 of the critical current ( in this case , the critical current is estimated from the product of the junction conductance and superconducting energy gap and can exceed the experimentally measured switching current by two orders of magnitude ) .    in the present paper ,",

    "drive , in the regime where josephson junction exhibits well - developed shapiro steps @xcite .",
    "one of the motivations of the research on shapiro steps was the better synchronization conditions in comparison with d.c .",
    "voltage bias .",
    "the reason for this is that the big quality factor @xmath5 of the nanomechanical resonance results in a narrow fiske - like current peak .",
    "its width in voltage can be estimated as @xmath6 .",
    "this imposes a severe limitation on voltage noise @xmath7 : to resolve the peak one must achieve @xmath8 .",
    "this may be challenging under realistic experimental circumstances .",
    "there is a way out : the voltage can be synchronized with the frequency of external irradiation .",
    "this effectively reduces the noise . from the other hand",
    ", the external irradiation can excite the mechanical motion by itself .",

    "the paper is organized as follows .    in section [ prop ]",
    "we describe the setup concentrating separately on the electrical and mechanical properties in the corresponding subsections and introduce the notations . in section [ fe ]",
    "we analyze in detail the mechanisms of coupling between mechanical and electrical degrees of freedom .",
    "we consider electrostatic energy , derive and explicate the concept of _ josephson mechanical force_. we present a rather involved analysis of competing non - linearities and conclude that for our devices the mechanical non - linearities dominate and the josephson force can be strong enough to induce the non - linear mechanical response .",
    "we give the workflow we use to compute the mechanical response . in the end of the section , we specify a set of concrete parameters based on experimentally measured values . in section [ sec : phasebias ] we address the phase bias conditions .",
    "we reveal that the _ phase - dependent shift _ of the resonant frequency can be quite noticeable and discuss lorentz - like and fano - like frequency dependences of the mechanical response . in section [ sec : dcvoltage ] we discuss the fiske - type mechanical response at josephson frequency matching the resonance frequency of the mechanical resonator , or an integer fraction of this frequency by higher harmonics , and give the estimations of the effect .",
    "we shortly discuss the parametric excitation . in section",
    "[ sec : shapiro - res ] we study the mechanical response at the shapiro steps in the regime where the a.c . driving frequency matches the resonant frequency and present the mechanisms and peculiarities of this response . in section",
    "[ sec : shapiro - non - res ] we consider the non - resonant driving that appears to efficiently excite the mechanical motion in the regime of shapiro steps .",
    "our concluding remarks are presented in section [ concl ] .",
    "the setup under consideration is sketched in figure [ cnt ] where we concentrate on a case where both josephson junction and mechanical resonator are realized with the same single cnt . even in this case",
    ", the coupling between mechanical and electrical degrees of freedom is relatively weak .",
    "this permits us to describe the electrical and mechanical aspects of the setup separately .",
    "we provide such description in this section , while in the next section we concentrate on the coupling .",
    "we consider a conducting link between two superconducting leads ( the cnt in fig .",
    "1 ) . in general",
    ", the current flowing in this junction is a complicated non - linear and time - delayed function of superconducting phase difference between the leads .",
    "however we assume that in the relevant frequency range the current response of the junction is superconducting and instant .",
    "the junction is included into an external electric circuit and the voltage drop at the junction is related to the time derivative of josephson phase , @xmath9 . in general , a circuit that connects the leads can be described by a complex frequency - dependent impedance @xmath10 in series with a voltage source @xmath11 .",
    "we typically assume that @xmath12 by far exceeds the typical junction impedance at low frequencies while at frequency scale of josephson generation frequency @xmath13 , @xmath10 is negligible in comparison with the junction response . in this case",
    ", the junction is current - biased at low frequencies with @xmath14 and voltage - biased at josephson frequencies . while this scheme looks different from the traditional rsj model where the external impedance is connected in parallel and the junction is current - biased , it is equivalent to a generalized rsj upon transforming the impedance and the voltage source .",
    "for instance , the linear part of possible quasiparticle response of the junction can be incorporated into @xmath10 .",
    "in addition , the junction is affected by the gate electrode biased by voltage source @xmath15 .",
    "the bias and gate circuits are disconnected at zero frequency . at finite frequency",
    ", there is a cross - talk between the circuits which is difficult to eliminate or even characterize in realistic experimental circumstances .",
    "we account for that by correlating a.c .",
    "parts of the voltage sources @xmath16 .",
    "for instance , if the gate voltage consists of a d.c . part and a harmonic signal at frequency @xmath17 , @xmath18 ,",
    "the bias voltage source should also oscillate at the same frequency , @xmath19 .",
    "the ratio of two a.c .",
    "amplitudes and their mutual phase shift @xmath20 is determined by details of the crosstalk .",
    "we will show below that the interference of these two a.c .",
    "signals may strongly affect the d.c .",
    "currents in the junction .",
    "the superconducting current is determined by the instant phase difference , @xmath21 . in this case , it is related to the josephson energy @xmath22 of the junction , @xmath23 it is essential for us that the josephson energy is not only a function of phase difference but also depends on the gate voltage through the charge @xmath24 induced in the resonator , @xmath25 .    for a nanotube device ,",
    "the origin of this charge sensitivity is ( weak ) coulomb blockade of electrons in the middle of the nanotube .",
    "the nanotube can be viewed as two junctions in series , those being formed at contact with metallic leads .",
    "if the conductance of the junctions is smaller or comparable with the conductance quantum @xmath26 coulomb interactions become important and set a quasiperiodic dependence of josephson energy on @xmath27 with a period @xmath28 .",
    "this corresponds to charge quantization in the middle of the nanotube .",
    "we routinely observe the quasi - periodic modulation of superconducting currents in fabricated nanotube devices .",
    "the modulation can be tuned by changing the gate voltage at scale of @xmath29 from values of the order of @xmath30 to several per cent .",
    "big modulation and well - developed coulomb blockade require big junction resistances , this strongly suppresses the superconducting current .",
    "it is therefore advantageous to have intermediate resistances @xmath31 . at @xmath32",
    "we typically observe 30% modulation .",
    "the superconducting current is a periodic function of the phase @xmath33 and therefore can be expanded in harmonics as @xcite : @xmath34 if one neglects all harmonics except the first one , @xmath35 gives the critical current of the josephson junction .",

    "mechanical resonators can be realized in a variety of ways @xcite . in many cases the adequate description of the resonator",
    "can be achieved with a minimum model that accounts for excitations of a single resonator mode , neglecting coupling to any other modes .",
    "the minimum model is given by the following equation of motion for a displacement variable @xmath36 : @xmath37 here @xmath38 is the time - dependent driving force , @xmath39 is the effective mass corresponding to the mode , @xmath40 stands for the resonant frequency , @xmath41 is the damping rate , and @xmath42 is the parameter describing the leading cubic non - linearity @xcite .",
    "the cubic non - linearity provides the important restriction on the magnitude of the displacement at resonant frequency as a reaction on resonant force .",
    "we also keep the second - order non - linearity @xmath43 .",
    "although it is not important in analysis of the reaction at resonant force , it describes the shift of the resonant frequency due to constant force .",

    ", we keep @xmath27 in the argument of @xmath22 , although @xmath114 .",
    "the point is that the josephson energy is sensitive to variations of @xmath27 of the order of @xmath115 , and ( @xmath116 ) can in principle be of this order .",

    "in contrast to the gate driving force , the time dependence of the josephson force is determined by the phase dynamics rather than the external modulation of the gate voltage .",

    "the alternative mechanism of generating a @xmath98-dependent force was recently proposed by g. sonne _ _ e__t al @xcite .",

    "this corresponds to a potential drop of @xmath147 @xmath1 over a distance of @xmath148 @xmath61 . for these values @xmath149 suggesting that the josephson force dominates .",
    "therefore in the rest of the paper we will disregard the lorentz force .",
    "if one imagines a ballistic nanotube , the josephson coupling is not affected by the induced charge . in this case",
    "the lorentz force would be the only superconducting phase - dependent driving mechanism .",

    "let us bring together three coupled equations governing the dynamics of the setup @xmath150 the first equation describes the dynamics of superconducting phase difference @xmath151 and is obtained by applying kirchhoff s laws to the circuit .",
    "the second equation is for the mechanical displacement @xmath45 where we substitute the electrostatic force ( [ eq : for_force ] ) .",
    "the induced charge @xmath27 enters both equations , and at the same time is defined by the third equation , that is , its value depends both on @xmath98 and @xmath36 .",
    "therefore the equations are coupled .",
    "we wish to simplify these equations under experimentally relevant assumptions . for this",

    "the characteristic dependences on @xmath323 make the identification easy .",
    "we illustrate the response for higher steps in fig .",
    "[ fig : higher - steps - second ] ( second step ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : higher - steps - fifth ] ( fifth step ) .",
    "in both cases , the response correlates with the shapiro step width given in the upper plots : it vanishes when the width achieves a maximum or becomes zero . in distinction from the first step ,",
    "the responses vanish at vanishing @xmath323 .",
    "their typical values are of the same order . however , the envelopes of the responses decrease rather slow with increasing @xmath323 .     for @xmath363 and @xmath364 at the second shapiro step @xmath365 . ]     at the fifth shapiro step @xmath366.,title=\"fig : \" ] [ fig : higher - steps - fifth ]",
    "in the previous section , we concentrate on the case when the driving frequency @xmath17 matches the resonant frequency of the mechanical oscillator .",
    "it is not a necessary condition for an efficient excitation of the resonant mode .",
    "the josephson dynamics at shapiro steps are essentially non - linear . as a consequence ,",
    "the spectrum of current oscillations contain all higher harmonics @xmath367 of the driving frequency @xmath17 .",
    "the same pertains the josephson force .",
    "therefore , the resonator can be efficiently excited for @xmath368 , @xmath369 being an integer number . at",
    "any given @xmath97 , the resonant conditions are achieved for any shapiro step number @xmath300 , and thus for voltages @xmath370 .",
    "these non - resonant driving conditions are advantageous for observation of the josephson force since the a.c .",
    "gate voltage force is not in the resonance , does not cause any appreciable displacement and therefore does not mask the effect of the josephson force . in this short section , we will thus concentrate on the case of the non - resonant driving @xmath371 .",
    "the amplitudes of the detecting current and the josephson force depended not only on the step number @xmath300 and the oscillating phase @xmath323 , but also on @xmath97 .",
    "they are given by @xmath372 where the dependence on the sign of the voltage is again incorporated into @xmath361 .",
    "since the gate force is absent , the response is given by a relation similar to eq .",
    "[ eq : firststep - jo ] that contains the josephson force only : @xmath373 it is again separated onto two terms discussed above , only the first term being responsible for the modification of the extremum currents of the shapiro steps .",
    "we illustrate the dependences on @xmath323 in fig .",
    "[ fig : offresonantresponse1 ] ( for @xmath374 ) and fig .",
    "[ fig : offresonantresponse2 ] ( for @xmath375 ) for the first three steps with @xmath376 .",
    "the vertical arrangement of the plots is the same as in the previous figures except we chose a single value of the maximum josephson force @xmath364 that brings us deep into the non - linear regime . in this regime ,",
    "the response is of the same order of magnitude for all steps and ratios @xmath97 , while retaining unique @xmath377 specific dependence on @xmath98 that can be used for identification of the effect and the characterization of the josephson force .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied josephson junction dynamics affected by excitation of a mechanical resonator . we have demonstrated that the mechanical oscillations can be rectified giving rise to an additional d.c .",
    "current that can be used for detection .",
    "the mechanical response is proportional to the oscillation amplitude , and is estimated as @xmath378 .",
    "the resonator can be driven by the a.c .",
    "voltage applied to the gate electrode as well as an additional mechanical force , termed the josephson force , that depends on the superconducting phase difference at the junction .",
    "we estimate the josephson force as @xmath379 and show that it is sufficiently strong to drive the mechanical resonator into the non - linear regime .",
    "we also show that it is typically larger than magneto - induced force proposed in @xcite .",
    "we have presented a general and detailed analysis of the coupling between electrical and mechanical degrees of freedom , discussing the competing non - linearities .",
    "this analysis is applied to a josephson device with a suspended cnt resonator , where we show that the intrinsic non - linearity scales dominate those arising from the coupling .",
    "we have provided analytical formulas for the response of the device to mechanical excitations in a wide interval of the excitation strengths and for various biasing schemes .",
    "we discuss distinct frequency dependencies , lorentz and fano - like , of the mechanical response both for linear and non - linear regimes and show how these arise based on the nature of the resonant mechanical force . in the case of a phase biased junction we show that the resonant frequency of the mechanical mode acquires a measurable phase - dependent shift ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : shift ] ) .",
    "we have discussed conditions of detecting the enhanced mechanical response arising when the josephson frequency matches the resonance frequency of the mechanical mode .",
    "we reasoned that the regime of shapiro steps is advantageous , since the fluctuations of the voltage drop over the junction are suppressed .",
    "we provided expressions for the mechanical response in the regime of shapiro steps and demonstrated that it manifests as modifications of the extrema of the steps .",
    "we show that the mechanical mode can be efficiently excited not only by resonant a.c .",
    "signals , but also by a.c .",
    "signals with frequencies close to an integer fraction of the mechanical resonance frequency .",
    "our preliminary experimental results confirm this behavior ; these will be reported elsewhere .",
