    "black hole ( bh ) and neutron star ( ns ) binaries end their lives by emitting a chirp - like burst of gravitational wave ( gw ) radiation",
    ". the inspiral radiation from ns - ns sources located within a distance of 20 mpc , and bh - bh sources within 200 mpc , should be observable by a first - generation network of ground - based long - baseline interferometric gw detectors @xcite .",
    "correlating the detector output ( data ) with a family of expected waveforms ( templates ) and using the largest correlator as a detection statistic , provides the best detection strategy for gaussian colored stationary noise ( maximum likelihood , matched filtering @xcite ) , but as we will not know the waveform parameters beforehand , a bank of 10 - 100 thousands of templates will have to be used so as not to miss out any source @xcite .",
    "data analysis groups have been , therefore , steadily looking for data analysis economization strategies .    in setting up a bank of templates to search for a signal with uknown parameters the quantity of interest @xcite is the ( frequency domain ) scalar product between the signal @xmath3 and the template(s ) @xmath4 .",
    "the scalar product defined in this context is similar to the usual vector space definition , except that the measure is derived from the detector noise power spectral density @xmath5 : @xmath6 , \\label{eq : scal_prod}\\ ] ] where c.c .",
    "denotes the complex conjugate .",
    "it is customary to use unit - norm templates , for which @xmath7 . under this assumption the scalar product",
    "is also called _ deflection _ , and denoted by @xmath8 @xcite . the normalized deflection obtained by further dividing @xmath9 by @xmath10",
    "is the _ overlap _ or ambiguity function .",
    "it is a real number in @xmath11 $ ] , and is a measure of how similar the template and the signal are .",
    "given a binary inspiral signal and a template , the ( nominal ) times at which they coalesce and the phases at the times of coalescence are unimportant for the purpose of data analysis .",
    "we can , therefore , preliminarily maximise the overlap over these parameters @xcite .",
    "such a maximised overlap is called the _ match _ @xcite , and is a function of the remaining ( intrinsic ) source and template parameters @xcite .",
    "the minimal match @xmath12 is the smallest _ overlap _ of a signal of arbitrary parameters with the template closest to it in the template bank @xcite .",
    "it is immediately related to the fraction @xmath13 of potentially observable sources which _ might _ be missed out @xcite .    in a recent paper @xcite it has been pointed out that ( under certain assumptions ) the match is a quasi band - limited function of the difference between the intrinsic source and template parameters . as such , it can be _ approximated _ by a cardinal imterpolating expansion , which uses only _ a fraction _ of the templates needed by the std .",
    "lattice for a prescribed minimal match .",
    "the same _ economized _ template set can be used to build a cardinal - interpolated formula for the partially maximised correlator , under the same minimal match constraint .",
    "this was shown in @xcite for the simplest ( but rather unrealistic ) case of newtonian ( 0pn ) chirp signals . at the lowest newtonian ( 0pn )",
    "order an inspiral waveform depends only on a single parameter @xcite . in this one - parameter template space , the cardinal - interpolation method @xcite leads to a reduction in the number of templates by a factor @xmath14 for @xmath15 , and the resulting template density is close to an absolute minimum set by the theory of quasi - band - limited functions .",
    "as anticipated in @xcite , one expects an even _ larger _ reduction in the number of templates for multi - parameter pn models , in view of well known properties of cardinal interpolating expansion in several dimensions ( see references quoted in @xcite ) .    in this rapid communication",
    "we present results for the case of first - post - newtonian ( 1pn ) signals and templates , which support the above expectation .",
    "we show that in the two - dimensional 1pn template space the reduction in the number of templates is by a factor @xmath16 for @xmath15 .",
    "a similar reduction in the computational resources is implied , which we believe the interferometric detector projects such as tama , geo , ligo and virgo might benefit from . in the following",
    "we present only essential ideas and results , deferring the details to a longer version . throughout this paper",
    "we use geometrized units ( i.e. , @xmath17 ) .",
    "we shall use the _ restricted _ pn approximation , where the amplitude of the waveform is kept to lowest ( newtonian ) pn order , while the phase is expanded to the highest pn order available @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the instantaneous orbital phase @xmath18 of an ( adiabatically ) inspiraling compact circular - orbit binary is obtained ( in parametric form ) by solving a pair of ordinary differential equations @xcite : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the gauge independent relative velocity of the two stars , @xmath21 is the gravitational wave flux ( luminosity ) , and @xmath22 the dimensionless relativistic binding energy of the system , related by @xmath23 .",
    "the instantaneous gravitational wave frequency @xmath24 is related to the orbital phase , and hence via ( [ eq : ode ] ) to @xmath20 , by : @xmath25 the flux and energy functions are presently known to order @xmath26 ( 2.5 pn ) for non - spinning binaries @xcite .    the gravitational wave ( dominant , @xmath27 multipole , @xmath28 harmonic of orbital frequency ) emitted by an inspiraling compact binary and sensed by an interferometric antenna is described by the waveform @xcite : @xmath29 ,     \\label{eq : td_signal}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the distance to the source , and @xmath31 is a constant in the range @xmath11 $ ] dependent on the relative source / detector orientation with r.m.s value @xmath32 ( average over all orientations and wave polarisations ) @xcite .",
    "it is straightforward to obtain an explicit frequency - domain ( fourier transform ) representation of the waveform  ( [ eq : td_signal ] ) using the stationary phase approximation @xcite : @xmath33 } , \\label{eq : fd_signal}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the stationary point @xcite and an overdot denotes the derivative w.r.t .",
    "@xmath35 . on substituting for the stationary point @xmath34 , and consistently using the available pn expansions of the flux and energy functions , the phase in eq .  ( [ eq : fd_signal ] ) takes on the simple form : @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 is the ( nominal ) time of coalescence @xcite , @xmath39 is the phase at @xmath40 .",
