    "the outcomes are many folds .",
    "various types of fractional derivatives were introduced : riemann - liouville , caputo , hadamard , erdlyi - kober , grnwald - letnikov , marchaud and riesz are just a few to name @xcite .",

    "this makes it necessitates to use the @xmath4derivative in equation  [ eq3 ] .",
    "now , we prove the result following a standard limit - approach . to this end , in one hand , if the function @xmath47 is constant in a neighborhood containing @xmath24 , then @xmath76 . on the other hand ,",
    "assume that the function @xmath47 is non - constant in the neighborhood of @xmath24 .",
    "in this case , we can find an @xmath77 such that , @xmath78 for any @xmath79 . now , since @xmath47 is continuous at @xmath24 , for @xmath80 sufficiently small , we have @xmath81 for @xmath82 .",

    "the result similar to ( 6 ) does not appear in @xcite .",
    "the argument used in equation ( [ eq1 ] ) was / will be utilized in several occasions in the paper .",
    "the following theorem lists @xmath4fractional derivative of several familiar functions .",
    "the results are identical to that of conformable fractional derivative discussed in @xcite , which will be shown to be a special case of @xmath4fractional derivative defined in ( [ df ] ) .",
    "[ thm4 ] let @xmath85 and @xmath30 $ ] .",

    "@xmath89 5 .",

    "implies that any function which possesses a fourier expansion behaves as having classical derivatives .",
    "this would be an interesting topic for further research .",
    "in @xcite , the author introduced fractional integrals and derivatives , which generalize the riemann - liouville and the hadamard fractional integrals and derivatives to a single form . in the next subsection , we show that the results obtained by khalil et at .",
    "@xcite are special cases of the more general extension discussed in this paper .",
    "let us first define a truncated exponential function given by , @xmath99 with the help of this definition , we will define another fractional derivative given below .",

    "then the _ fractional derivative _ of @xmath3 of order @xmath8 is defined by , @xmath100 for @xmath16 .",
    "if @xmath3 is @xmath4differentiable in some @xmath17 , and @xmath101 exists , then define @xmath102    now , it is easy to see that @xmath103 and @xmath104 where the expression on the right - hand - side of ( [ ndef1 ] ) is the conformable fractional derivative defined in ( [ def1 ] ) in @xcite , while the one on ( [ ndef2 ] ) is the @xmath4fractional derivative defined in this paper . furthermore , if @xmath2 the equation ( [ ndef1 ] ) becomes the classical definition of the first derivative of a function @xmath3 at a point @xmath48 . while , noting that @xmath105 , we may also show that the equation ( [ ndef2 ] ) is equivalent to the classical definition of the first derivative of a function @xmath3 .",
    "these observations further suggest that there are corresponding results similar to the rolle s theorem and the mean value theorem .",
    "next , we give those two results .",

    "hence , there exists @xmath111 , such that @xmath118 .",
    "using the fact that @xmath119 , the result follows .    as a result of the fractional mean value theorem",

    "figure 1 depicts the graphs of the @xmath4fractional derivatives of the power function @xmath122 for @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the function @xmath125 has a constant derivative equal to @xmath126 , and not equal to @xmath127 as in the case of the riemann - liouville derivative .",
    "this also suggests that the new derivative should have a rather different interpretation in the geometrical sense , which has yet to be discovered .",
    "further , it can be seen that a function could be @xmath4differential at a point but not differentiable in the classical sense .",
    "( cf . page 67 of @xcite ) .",
    "for example , the function @xmath128 is everywhere @xmath129differentiable and has the derivative of @xmath130 while it is not differentiable at @xmath131 .",

    "then the @xmath4fractional derivative of @xmath3 is defined by @xmath135 if the limit exists .    as a direct consequence of definition [ def5 ] and part ( 7 ) of theorem [ thm3 ]",
    ", we can show that @xmath136 , where @xmath132 $ ] and @xmath3 is @xmath137differentiable at @xmath32 .",
    "now , the question whether the fractional derivative @xmath138 has a corresponding @xmath4fractional integral will be answered next . for simplicity",
    ", we shall only consider the class of continuous functions here .",
    "the results can easily be extended to more general settings and will be discussed in forthcoming papers .",
    "as in the works of @xcite , it is interesting to note that , in spite of the variation of the definitions of the fractional derivatives , we can still adopt the same definition of the fractional integral here due to the fact that we obtained similar results in theorem [ thm4 ] as of the results ( 1)(6 ) and ( i)(iii ) in @xcite .",
    "so , we have the following definition .",
    "let @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
