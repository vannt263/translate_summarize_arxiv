    "the formation of surface nanostructures such as islands or quantum dots during heteroepitaxy of strained films has attracted continuing great interest , due to its importance in both fundamental understanding of material growth and its wide range of applications particularly for optoelectronic nano devices @xcite .",
    "one of the underlying mechanisms of island formation has been attributed to the occurrence of morphological instability of the strained film ( i.e. , the asaro - tiller - grinfeld instability @xcite ) , for which the competition between the stabilization effect of film surface energy and the destabilization effect of system elastic energy due to film - substrate misfit strain plays a key role .",
    "this involves the procedure of stress release in the film via surface mass transport driven by local energy gradient and consequently the formation of coherent nonplanar surface structures like nanoscale islands @xcite .",
    "compared to other formation mechanisms such as thermally activated nucleation , a main feature here is the continuous , nucleationless nature of the film instability and the subsequent island growth that starts from rough surface @xcite .",
    "it results in more regular and correlated arrays of self assembled quantum dots that are appealing for a variety of applications .",
    "the onset of this type of quantum dots or strained islands formation has been well understood , as studied via detailed instability analysis for both single - component @xcite and alloy strained films @xcite as well as multilayers / superlattices @xcite . such film instability , showing as surface ripples and cell - like undulations which are the precursor of coherent island formation , has been observed in experiments of semiconductor heteroepitaxial films such as sige @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the subsequent nonlinear evolution of these strained dots that are well beyond the initial linear stability stage , is more complicated and much less understood .",
    "a typical phenomenon is the coarsening of quantum dot islands , showing as the increase of average island size during film evolution and the shrinking of small dots .",
    "such scenario has been observed in experiments of ge / si(001 ) @xcite , sige / si(001 ) @xcite , and inas / gaas(001 ) @xcite , although with different mechanisms and behavior of coarsening reported .",
    "for the example of ge - si systems that have been extensively studied , nonlinear island coarsening rate that deviates from classical results of ostwald ripening has been found ; however , it was associated with different mechanisms of island morphology evolution in different experiments , such as the effect of island shape transition accompanying the coarsening process @xcite or a contrasting kinetic picture that incorporates elastic interactions but not island shape transition @xcite . also , the slowing @xcite or suppression @xcite of coarsening process at late stage and the resulting saturated , stabilized quantum dot arrays",
    "@xcite have been observed in some experiments , but not others @xcite .",
    "the corresponding theoretical / computational study on nonlinear island evolution is also far from conclusive .",
    "most efforts are based on continuum approaches including continuum elasticity theory and phase field methods @xcite , in addition to other modeling techniques that incorporate crystalline details , such as kinetic monte carlo method with elastic interaction @xcite and the recently developed phase - field - crystal ( pfc ) model and the associated amplitude equation formalism @xcite . for continuum elasticity modeling , which is the current main avenue for studying strained island coarsening due to the large length and time scales involved ,",
    "much recent focus has been put on the derivation and simulation of nonlinear evolution equations through approximating the system elasticity and the dynamics of film morphology via perturbation methods .",
    "two limits of system configuration were addressed in early studies of such approach , including the limit of perfectly rigid substrate @xcite and the case of infinitely thick strained film @xcite .",
    "more recently , similar approximation has been applied to heteroepitaxial systems consisting of a strained thin film grown on an elastic substrate as configured in most experiments .",
    "the corresponding reduced nonlinear evolution equations have been derived and simulated , based on the long - wave or small - slope approximation of film surface profile @xcite or the assumption of small surface gradient @xcite . some physical mechanisms in thin film growth have also been incorporated , such as the wetting effect between the strained film and the underlying substrate .",
    "these approaches are more efficient for large scale simulations , as compared to directly solving the full system elasticity problem and the corresponding full dynamic equation of morphological profile , which instead is of high computational cost and hence usually involves limited system size , island number , and evolution time particularly for three - dimensional ( 3d ) systems .    despite the success of these theoretical approaches in describing properties of quantum dot formation and film morphology , some behavior of film nonlinear evolution , particularly the process of island coarsening vs. saturation , is still not well understood , with inconsistent results given in different studies . for the case of film annealing as examined in most simulations , coarsening of strained island arrays has been reproduced , although with different coarsening rate found in different approaches @xcite .",
    "one of the main difference in these work is the result for asymptotic and steady state of the film morphology .",
    "stable arrays of quantum dots that persist after the coarsening stage have been obtained in both studies of the reduced nonlinear evolution equation @xcite and the direct solution of the full elasticity problem @xcite , consistent with the observation in some si - ge experiments @xcite . however , as in some other experiments @xcite such scenario of the suppression or cessation of island coarsening was not found in other modeling processes @xcite , and recent nonlinear analysis of a system evolution equation suggested that a regular quantum dot array would be unstable as a result of subcritical bifurcation @xcite .",
    "note that in many previous studies the saturation of coarsening islands has been attributed to the effect of surface energy anisotropy @xcite , although the saturation phenomenon has also been observed in recent simulation without such anisotropy effect @xcite .",
    "these discrepancies in modeling results could probably be related to different types of approximation and various ways of small variable expansion and truncation involved in the approaches , and/or the difficulty in simulating large enough system size and long enough evolution time required for experimental comparison .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the nonlinear evolution of strained quantum dot islands grown epitaxially on an elastic substrate , based on a continuum elasticity model and the development of a systematic approach for approximately solving the film - substrate elastic state via a perturbation analysis in fourier space .",
    "results up to second- and third - order perturbation of surface morphology are presented , and our approach can be readily extended to incorporate higher - order solutions .",
    "we can then derive a new nonlinear evolution equation governing the dynamics of strained film morphology , which allows us to systematically examine the detailed behavior of island evolution at large enough spatial and temporal scales .",
    "this nonlinear equation , with the incorporation of the wetting effect and also a second - order truncation in the elastic solution , is applied to the study of the coarsening and saturating process in post - deposited , annealing films .",
    "our focus is on systems of small misfit strains , which correspond to large enough length scale of the resulting surface structure as compared to the scale of crystalline lattice .",
    "( this is based on recent studies @xcite showing that continuum approaches , such as the continuum elasticity theory developed here , can well describe the films in weak strain limit , but not for large misfit stress which would lead to qualitatively different behavior of surface islands due to the effects of discrete lattice structure . )",
    "the whole series of island evolution can be reproduced in our numerical simulations , including three characteristic regimes : the development of morphological instability and island formation at early times , nonlinear coarsening of islands at intermediate stage , and the slowing of such coarsening process which leads to a saturated state of steady quantum dot arrays .",
    "we also investigate the mechanisms underlying the phenomenon of island stabilization and saturation , based on the study of wetting effect on the constraint of surface mass transport between island valleys and peaks , and also on a detailed examination of strain relaxation process via studying the temporal evolution and spatial distribution of elastic energy density at the film surface .",
    "we identify a new factor responsible for suppressing the island growth and coarsening , which is attributed to the effect of high - order elastic energy of individual islands and the elastic interaction between them .",
    "assume that a strained film of spatially varying height @xmath0 is deposited epitaxially on a semi - infinite elastic substrate that occupies the region @xmath1 .",
    "the misfit strain in the film with respect to the substrate is given by @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the lattice spacings of the film and the substrate respectively .",
    "for such coherent , dislocation - free system , the evolution of the film surface morphological profile @xmath0 is governed by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the kinetic coefficient determined by surface diffusion , @xmath7 is the surface laplacian , @xmath8 is the deposition rate , and @xmath9 . here",
    "the effect of film - substrate interdiffusion is neglected .",
    "the total free energy functional @xmath10 consists of two parts , including the elastic energy @xmath11 where @xmath12 represents the strain energy density , and the surface free energy @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the thickness - dependent , isotropic surface tension with the effect of wetting interaction between the film and substrate incorporated .",

    "<S> nonlinear evolution of three - dimensional strained islands or quantum dots in heteroepitaxial thin films is studied via a continuum elasticity model and the development of a nonlinear dynamic equation governing the film morphological profile . </S>",
    "<S> all three regimes of island array evolution are identified and examined , including a film instability regime at early stage , a nonlinear coarsening regime at intermediate times , and the crossover to a saturated asymptotic state , with detailed behavior depending on film - substrate misfit strains but not qualitatively on finite system sizes . </S>",
    "<S> the phenomenon of island stabilization and saturation , which corresponds to the formation of steady but non - ordered arrays of strained quantum dots , occurs at later time for smaller misfit strain . </S>",
    "<S> it is found to be controlled by the strength of film - substrate wetting interaction which would constrain the valley - to - peak mass transport and hence the growth of island height , and also determined by the effect of elastic interaction between surface islands and the high - order strain energy of individual islands at late evolution stage . </S>",
    "<S> the results are compared to previous experimental and theoretical studies on quantum dots coarsening and saturation . </S>"
