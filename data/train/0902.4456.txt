    "despite their apparently separated application areas , general relativity and quantum information are not disjoint research fields . on the contrary , following the pioneering work of alsing and milburn @xcite a wealth of works",
    "@xcite has considered different situations in which entanglement was studied in a general relativistic setting , for instance , quantum information tasks in the proximity of black holes @xcite , entanglement in an expanding universe @xcite , entanglement with non - inertial partners @xcite etc .",
    "entanglement behavior in non - inertial frames was first considered in @xcite where the fidelity of teleportation between relative accelerated partners was analyzed .",
    "after this , occupation number entanglement degradation of scalar @xcite and dirac @xcite fields due to unruh effect @xcite was shown .",
    "recent works studied the effect of the instantaneous wigner rotations and thomas spin precession on entanglement @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the previous work @xcite on unruh effect for dirac field mode entanglement does not consider the spin of the parties .",
    "hence , only two occupation numbers @xmath3 are allowed for each mode .",
    "higher values of @xmath4 are forbidden by pauli exclusion principle . however , addressing the effect of unruh decoherence on spin entanglement can only be done by incorporating the spin of the parties in the framework from the very beginning . as a consequence ,",
    "occupation number @xmath5 is also allowed .",
    "this fact will affect occupation number entanglement which has to be reconsidered in this new setting .",
    "for this purpose , in this work we will study the case of two parties ( alice and rob ) sharing a general superposition of dirac vacuum and all the possible one particle spin states for both alice and rob .",
    "alice is in an inertial frame while rob undergoes a constant acceleration @xmath6 .",
    "we will show that rob when he is accelerated respect to an inertial observer of the dirac vacuum would observe a thermal distribution of fermionic spin @xmath7 particles due to unruh effect @xcite .",
    "next , we will consider that alice and rob share spin bell states in a minkowski frame .",
    "then , the case in which alice and rob share a superposition of the dirac vacuum and a specific one particle state in a maximally entangled combination . in both cases",
    "we analyze the entanglement and mutual information in terms of rob s acceleration @xmath6 .",
    "finally , we will study the case when the information about spin is erased from our setting by partial tracing , remaining only the occupation number information . here",
    ", entanglement is more degraded than in @xcite .",
    "this comes about because more accessible levels of occupation number are allowed , so our system has a broader margin to become degraded .",
    "this paper is structured in the following sections .    in sections",
    "[ sec2 ] , and [ sec3 ] we introduce the basic formalism and notation to deal with dirac fields from the point of view of an accelerated observer taking its spin structure into account . in section [ sec4 ]",
    "we study how the minkowski vacuum state is expressed by an accelerated observer when the spin of each mode is included in the setting , discussing the implications of the single - mode approximation often carried out in the literature @xcite . also , we build the one particle state with spin @xmath8 in rindler coordinates and analyze the unruh effect when the spin structure is included . here",
    "we discuss the necessity of tracing over rindler s region iv for rob , since it is causally disconnected from region i in which we consider rob s location . in section [ sec5 ]",
    "we analyze how entanglement of spin bell states is degraded due to unruh effect .",
    "we show that , even in the limit of @xmath9 , some degree of entanglement is preserved due to pauli exclusion principle .",
    "then we analyze unruh effect on a completely different class of maximally entangled states ( like @xmath10 where @xmath8 and @xmath11 are @xmath12 component of spin labels ) comparing it with the spin bell states . in section [ sec6 ]",
    "we show that the erasure of spin information , in order to investigate occupation number entanglement alone , requires considering total spin states for the bipartite system .",
    "finally , our results and conclusions are summarized in section [ sec7 ] .",
    "we consider a free dirac field in a minkowski frame expanded in terms of the positive ( particle ) and the negative ( antiparticle ) energy solutions of dirac equation notated @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively : @xmath15 here , the subscript @xmath16 notates momentum which labels the modes of the same energy and @xmath17 is the spin label that indicates spin - up or spin - down along the quantization axis . @xmath18 and @xmath19 are respectively the annihilation operators for particles and antiparticles , and satisfy the usual anticommutation relations .    for each mode of frequency @xmath16 and spin @xmath8 the positive and negative energy modes have the form @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a spinor satisfying the normalization relations @xmath22 .",
    "the modes are classified as particle or antiparticle respect to @xmath23 ( minkowski killing vector directed to the future ) .",
    "the minkowski vacuum state is defined by the tensor product of each frequency mode vacuum @xmath24 such that it is annihilated by @xmath18 and @xmath19 for all values of @xmath8 .",
    "we will use the same notation as reference @xcite where the mode label will be a subscript inside the ket , and the absence of subscript outside the ket indicates a minkowski fock state .    in this way , and as a difference with previous works , we will consider the spin structure for each mode , and hence , the maximum occupation number is two .",
    "this introduces the following notation @xmath25 if @xmath26 the two particles state is not allowed due to pauli exclusion principle , so our allowed minkowski states for each mode of particle / antiparticle are @xmath27    consider that we have the following minkowski bipartite state @xmath28 with @xmath29 .",
    "the subscripts @xmath30 indicate the modes associated with alice and rob respectively .",
    "all other modes of the field are unoccupied that is to say that the complete state would be @xmath31$].    this state generalizes the bell spin states ( for instance , we have @xmath32 choosing @xmath33 ) or a modes entangled state ( for instance choosing @xmath34 ) . with this state",
    "we will be able to deal with two different and interesting problems at once , 1 .",
    "studying the unruh decoherence of spin entangled states and 2 . investigating the impact of considering the spin structure of the fermion on the occupation number entanglement and its unruh decoherence .    later on , under the single mode approximation , we will assume that alice is stationary and has a detector sensitive only to the mode @xmath35 , and rob moves with uniform acceleration @xmath6 taking with him a detector sensitive to the mode @xmath36 .",
    "an uniformly accelerated observer viewpoint is described by means of the well - known rindler coordinates @xcite . in order to cover the whole minkowski space - time , two different set of coordinates are necessary .",
    "these sets of coordinates define two causally disconnected regions in rindler space - time .",
    "if we consider that the uniform acceleration @xmath6 lies on the @xmath12 axis , the new rindler coordinates @xmath37 as a function of minkowski coordinates @xmath38 are @xmath39 for region i , and @xmath40 for region iv .",
    "[ fig1 ]   are hyperbolae and all the curves of constant proper time @xmath41 for the accelerated observer are straight lines that come from the origin .",
    "an uniformly accelerated observer rob travels along a hyperbola constrained to region i , title=\"fig : \" ]    as we can see from fig .",
    "1 , although we have covered the whole minkowski space - time with these sets of coordinates , there are two more regions labeled ii and iii .",
    "to map them we would need to switch @xmath42 in equations , . in these regions @xmath41 is a spacelike coordinate and @xmath12 is a timelike coordinate .",
    "however , the solutions of dirac equation in such regions are not required to discuss entanglement between alice and an accelerated observer since he would be constrained to either region i or iv , having no possible access to the opposite regions as they are causally disconnected @xcite .",
    "the rindler coordinates @xmath43 go from @xmath44 to @xmath45 independently in regions i and iv .",
    "it means that each region admits a separate quantization procedure with their corresponding positive and negative energy solutions @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "particles and antiparticles will be classified with respect to the future - directed timelike killing vector in each region . in region",
    "i the future - directed killing vector is @xmath48 whereas in region iv the future - directed killing vector is @xmath49 .",
    "this means that solutions in region i , having time dependence @xmath50 with @xmath51 , represent positive energy solutions , whereas solutions in region iv , having time dependence @xmath50 with @xmath51 , are actually negative energy solutions since @xmath52 points to the opposite direction of @xmath53 @xcite . as i and iv are causally disconnected @xmath54 and @xmath55 only have support in their own regions , vanishing outside them .",
    "let us denote @xmath56 the particle annihilation and creation operators in region i and @xmath57 the corresponding antiparticle operators .",
    "analogously we define @xmath58 the particle / antiparticle operators in region iv .",
    "these operators satisfy the usual anticommutation relations @xmath59 where the subscript r notates the rindler region of the operator @xmath60 .",
    "all other anticommutators are zero . that includes the anticommutators between operators in different regions of the rindler space - time .",
    "taking this into account we can expand the dirac field in rindler coordinates analogously to : @xmath61    equations and represent the decomposition of the dirac field in its modes in minkowski and rindler coordinates respectively .",
    "we can relate minkowski and rindler creation and annihilation operators by taking appropriate inner products @xcite .",
    "the relationship between minkowski and rindler particle / antiparticle operators is linear and the coefficients that relate them are called bogoliubov coefficients : @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 is a phase factor that will turn out to be irrelevant for our purposes .",
    "notice that as we are working with two spatial - temporal dimensions and with massless dirac field , the relation between rindler modes and minkowski modes is given in .",
    "we will discuss in the conclusions the implications of considering extra dimensions and massive fields , where minkowski modes are spread over all positive rindler frequencies @xcite .",
    "notice from bogoliubov transformations that the minkowski particle annihilator @xmath18 transforms into a rindler particle annihilator of momentum @xmath16 and spin @xmath8 in region i and an antiparticle creator of momentum @xmath65 and spin @xmath66 in region iv ( in region iv all the magnitudes that are not invariant under time reversal change ) .",
    "now that we have the relationships between the creation and annihilation operators in minkowski and rindler coordinates , we can obtain the expression of the minkowski vacuum state for each mode @xmath67 in rindler coordinates . for notation simplicity",
    ", we will drop the @xmath16 label in operators / states when it does not give any relevant information , but we will continue writing the spin label .",
    "it is useful to introduce some notation for our states .",
    "we will denote with a subscript outside the kets if the mode state is referred to region i or iv of the rindler space - time .",
    "the absence of subscript outside the ket will denote minkowski coordinates .",
    "the @xmath68 label of particle / antiparticle will be omitted throughout the paper because , for the cases considered , a ket referred to minkowski space - time or rindler s region i will always denote particle states and a ket referred to region iv will always notate antiparticle states .    inside the ket",
    "we will write the spin state of the modes as follows @xmath69 which will notate a particle state in region i and an antiparticle state in region iv respectively , both with spin @xmath8 .    we will use the following definitions for our kets @xmath70 and , being consistent with the different rindler regions operators anticommutation relations , @xmath71 @xmath72    now , it is useful to note that could be expressed as two - modes squeezing transformation for each @xmath16 @xcite @xmath73 where @xmath74\\ ] ] so , analogously to @xcite , it is reasonable to postulate that the minkowski vacuum is a rindler two - mode particles / antiparticles squeezed state with opposite spin and momentum states in i and iv .",
    "contrarily to @xcite , considering that the modes have spin , occupation number for each @xmath16 is allowed to be 2 , being higher occupation numbers forbidden by pauli exclusion principle . in the literature",
    "the analysis is restricted only to one mode of the minkowski field , but we can restrict our analysis to some sector of the minkowski vacuum , defining for the particles sector @xmath75 such that the particle sector of can be written as    in this fashion we are considering a discrete number @xmath4 of different modes @xmath76 , so minkowski vacuum should be expressed as a squeezed state in rindler coordinates which is an arbitrary superposition of spins and momenta .",
    "this will be useful to discuss what would happen if we relax the single - mode approximation carried out often in the literature and let our detectors have a small mode spread .",
    "@xmath77 where , here , the notation is @xmath78 with @xmath79 being @xmath80 and the symbol @xmath81 is @xmath82 1\\ ; \\text{otherwise } \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] which imposes pauli exclusion principle constraints on the state ( quantum numbers of fermions can not coincide ) .",
    "notice a pair of aspects of this notation for the multimode case .",
    "first , in the series in all the possible orders of the operators are implicitly written .",
    "due to the anticommutation relations of the fermionic operators , terms with different orderings of the creation operators are related , i.e. @xmath83",
    "so , without loss of generality , we could choose not to write all the possible orderings of the operators in .",
    "the difference between taking all the possible orderings of the operators into account and taking only one representant is a factor @xmath84 in the constants @xmath85 . from we",
    "can also see that the coefficients @xmath85 are symmetric with respect to @xmath86 index permutations .",
    "second , as there are only @xmath4 different modes @xmath87 , the last summation in equation has only @xmath88 terms due to .",
    "these terms are all the different permutations of the creation operators for pairs of opposed spins for each mode",
    ". there would be only one summand  instead of @xmath88in the simplified notation where we do not write all the different permutations of the operators but only one representant .",
    "it means that , in this simplified notation , the series of terms with @xmath4 pairs has the same summands as the series with the vacuum state ( i.e. only one ) . actually , in this notation ",
    "i.e . if we count all the different order permutations as only one the series with @xmath89 to @xmath90 has exactly the same number of summands as the series with @xmath91 to @xmath92 .    to obtain restrictions on the values of the coefficients @xmath85 we demand that the minkowski vacuum has to be annihilated by the particle annihilator , @xmath93 . translating this into rindler coordinates we have @xmath94{\\left| { 0 } \\right\\rangle}=0\\ ] ] where the vacuum state should be expressed in rindler coordinates using .",
    "as the elements form an orthogonal set , from we see that all the terms proportional to different elements of the set should be zero simultaneously , which gives the following conditions on the coefficients    * @xmath95 as a function of @xmath96 +    @xmath97    since equations , should be satisfied @xmath98 , we obtain that @xmath99 since @xmath96 does not depend on @xmath16 or @xmath8 .",
    "we will denote @xmath100 .    * @xmath101 as a function of @xmath102 +    @xmath103    since equations , should be satisfied @xmath98 , we obtain that @xmath104 where @xmath105 does not depend on spins or momenta since @xmath102 does not depend on @xmath16 or @xmath8 , the only dependence of the coefficients with @xmath106 and @xmath107 is given by the pauli exclusion principle , this dependence comes through function .",
    "in fact it is very easy to show that all the coefficients are independent of @xmath107 and @xmath106 apart from the pauli exclusion principle constraint. using the fact that @xmath96 does not depend on @xmath107 and @xmath106 and noticing that by applying the annihilator on the vacuum state and equalling it to zero , we will always obtain the linear relationship between @xmath108 and @xmath92 given below .    * @xmath85 as a function of @xmath109 +    @xmath110    we finally obtain that @xmath85 is a constant which can be expressed as a function of @xmath96 as @xmath111 and then , vacuum state can be expressed as @xmath112 where the only parameter not fixed yet is @xmath96 .",
    "we can now fix @xmath96 by imposing the normalization of the minkowski vacuum in rindler coordinates @xmath113 , @xcite this condition can be written as @xmath114=1\\ ] ] where @xmath115 and we have defined @xmath116 .",
    "this expression gives ( formally ) the value of @xmath96 ( except for a global phase ) when considering the populated levels in an arbitrary number of modes of the field @xmath117^{-1/2}\\ ] ] we can see that if we take the limit @xmath118 we recover the minkowski vacuum .",
    "we will come back to the behavior at the limits below .",
    "notice that the state is only normalizable in this discrete limit .",
    "this comes about because the minkowski and rindler representations are not unitary equivalent ( there is not unitary operator connecting the two vacua ) .",
    "it prevents us from taking the continuous limit in the expression but does not invalidate the treatment as equation can be considered as a superposition of a finite number of individual modes which are perfectly well defined @xcite .    to address the problem of showing how the presence of spin degrees of freedom affects the entanglement between accelerated observers , it is useful to use the single mode approximation @xcite in the same way that in @xcite .",
    "this is valid if we consider rob s detector so sensitive to a single particle mode in region i that we can approximate the frequency @xmath119 observed by alice to be the same frequency observed by rob , @xmath120 . as a consequence ,",
    "the populated levels we are looking at are in this single frequency @xcite ( see also discussion in @xcite ) so we can consider the sums over @xmath106 in just like a sum of only one mode @xmath121 .",
    "this is equivalent to restricting the analysis to the sector @xmath67 of the complete vacuum .",
    "since the goal of this work is to show the effect of spin degrees of freedom on the entanglement for non - inertial observers , this approximation allows us to compare our results with previous literature on scalar and spinless fermion fields @xcite .",
    "we have to notice that since the observer rob is accelerated , his possible measurements are affected by a doppler - like effect . given that the velocity of the observer is @xmath122 , the doppler effect will shift the sensitivity peak of the detector .",
    "namely , if at the instant @xmath123 his detector is sharply tuned to a frequency @xmath124 , to compensate this doppler effect at some instant @xmath125 the detector should be tuned to the frequency @xmath126 .",
    "this implies that any detector will eventually become insensitive to the populated levels of the minkowski field . in order to do the theoretical analysis in this work",
    ", we can consider either that his detector can be sharply tuned to the frequency @xmath127 for each instant , or that rob has a set of individual detectors each one sharply tuned to the proper frequency for each instant .",
    "carrying out this single - mode approximation , the minkowski vacuum for a single mode is a rindler two - mode particles / antiparticles squeezed state with opposite spin states in i and iv . considering that the modes have spin ,",
    "occupation number is allowed to be 2 for each @xmath16 , being higher occupation numbers forbidden by pauli exclusion principle . as a consequence @xmath128 notice that @xmath129 is the analogous to @xmath96 , @xmath130 and @xmath131 are analogous to @xmath132 and @xmath133 respectively and @xmath134 is analogous to @xmath105 in the expression but considering only one representant of all the 2 possible orders for the pair .    to obtain the values of the coefficients @xmath135 we demand that the minkowski vacuum has to be annihilated by the particle annihilator , @xmath136 . translating this into rindler coordinates we have @xmath137\\left[v{\\left| { 0 } \\right\\rangle_{i}\\left| { 0 } \\right\\rangle_{iv}}\\right.\\\\ * & + & \\left.a{\\left| { \\uparrow } \\right\\rangle_{i}\\left| { \\downarrow } \\right\\rangle_{iv}}+b{\\left| { \\downarrow } \\right\\rangle_{i}\\left| { \\uparrow } \\right\\rangle_{iv}}+ c{\\left| { { \\uparrow\\downarrow } } \\right\\rangle_{i}\\left| { { \\uparrow\\downarrow } } \\right\\rangle_{iv}}\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which implies @xmath138\\\\ * \\nonumber&&-e^{i\\phi}\\sin r\\left[v{\\left| { 0 } \\right\\rangle_{i}\\left| { -s } \\right\\rangle_{iv}}-a\\delta_{s\\downarrow}{\\left| { \\uparrow } \\right\\rangle_{i}\\left| { { \\uparrow\\downarrow } } \\right\\rangle_{iv}}\\right.\\\\ * & & \\left.+b\\delta_{s\\uparrow}{\\left| { \\downarrow } \\right\\rangle_{i}\\left| { { \\uparrow\\downarrow } } \\right\\rangle_{iv}}\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this equation gives 4 conditions ( two for each value of @xmath8 ) ,",
    "although only 3 of them are independent @xmath139 to fix @xmath129 we impose the normalization relation for each field mode @xmath140 , imposing this we finally obtain the values of the vacuum coefficients .",
    "@xmath141 notice that comparing this result with expressions and , as we have truncated the series in , the value of @xmath129 will be different from the case when more than one mode is considered @xmath96 instead of @xmath129. if we restrict the series on @xmath142 to only one mode @xmath143 in , we obtain that @xmath144 and we get then proper values for @xmath145 and @xmath146 .    since from @xmath147",
    ", comparing @xmath129 with , we can see that , while under the single - mode approximation the limit of infinite acceleration leads to a finite distribution of the minkowski vacuum over rindler states , when considering the multimode rindler expression for the vacuum state the combined limit of @xmath148 and @xmath149 leads to a complete fading away of the amplitudes over all the rindler modes as @xmath150 , which may not be the case for finite @xmath6 .",
    "this is beyond the scope of this article but we will discuss in the conclusion that it may have very strong implications on the entanglement of fermionic fields for accelerated observers .",

    "we obtain a factor 2 contrarily to ref .",
    "@xcite due to the degeneracy factor @xmath163 .",

    "this fact enables us to study interesting effects ( such as unruh decoherence for spin bell states ) and develop new procedures to erase spin information from the system in order to study occupation number entanglement .    along this work",
    "we have analyzed how a maximally entangled spin bell state losses entanglement when one of the partners accelerates .",

    "the maximally entangled occupation number state is obtained from the total spin singlet after tracing over total spin .",
    "finally we have shown that its entanglement and mutual information is more degraded than in @xcite where the spin structure of dirac modes was neglected . a reasonable physical argument for this result",
    "is that , in our setting , occupation number 2 is allowed for the dirac field modes , and hence , there is a broader margin for entanglement degradation by unruh effect .",
    "the thermal noise is obtained when dealing with a two dimensional space - time and massless fields .",
    "mass gap and transverse degrees of freedom modify the counting statistics that is no longer given by thermal noise , but replaced by the so - called rindler noise @xcite , that the the space - time dimension . in this work",
    "we were concerned with the specific issues associated to the spin degree of freedom , so the restriction to massless fields in two dimensional space - time adopted here , as well as the single mode approximation , allows a direct comparison with the previous works @xcite which considered massless spinless fields in 2d under those approximations .    as a matter of fact , having more than 2 space - temporal dimensions and having massive fields may introduce relevant effects . allowing the possibility of having momentum off the acceleration direction and having massive fields we would obtain a spread of minkowski modes over rindler frequencies @xcite .",
    "if we carry out the single - mode approximation , the spread of minkowski modes into rindler modes can be neglected even for higher dimensions @xcite , but if we want to relax such an approximation ( as for the discussion in the next paragraph ) , those effects should be considered in order to account for the entanglement in non - inertial frames .",
    "it would be worthwhile to study those effects in future articles .",
    "another very interesting point that deserves further study is the fact that when we consider more than one populated mode of the complete minkowski vacuum instead of the single mode approximation , the margin for unruh degradation increases as we could have in principle a larger number of levels that can be excited by the thermal / rindler noise .",
    "one could think that these cases would be quite similar to the bosonic case @xcite where the margin for unruh decoherence is so broad that no entanglement survives at the limit of @xmath9 .",
    "something similar would apply as well if we relax the single mode approximation allowing a small spread in both rob s detector and populated levels such that we consider a continuum of accessible levels .",
