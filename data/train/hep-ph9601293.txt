    "<S> given the fact that in the mssm , taking into account the present experimental bounds on the neutral higgs bosons , @xmath94 , for stops and charginos in the mass range accessible to lep2 , @xmath69 dominates over @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , due to the additional enhancement factor @xmath95 , @xmath69 represents the potentially largest contribution to @xmath3 , and gives rise to a strong dependence on @xmath96 near @xmath97 , due to the @xmath98 factor in eq .  </S>",

    "<S> some quantitative information is given in fig .  2 , which displays contours of the ratio [ rdelta ] r _ in the plane @xmath99 , for @xmath100  gev ( higher values of @xmath101 do not displace significantly the contours , and we have taken for definiteness @xmath102 ) . </S>",
    "<S> as can be seen , for values of @xmath96 close to 1 and light stop and chargino , one can obtain @xmath103 . </S>",
    "<S> however , a lower limit of @xmath104 can be obtained by requiring that the top yukawa coupling remain perturbative up to @xmath105 gev . </S>",
    "<S> one could also argue that charginos lighter than 65 gev would have been copiously produced in the recent run of lep  1.5 , whilst no candidate events have been reported by the standard chargino searches @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the reader should keep in mind that no mass bound stronger than the lep1 limit can be established yet if the chargino  neutralino mass difference is sufficiently small ( a likely possibility in our approximations ) , or if charginos have @xmath70-parity violating decays with final states consisting of jets and no missing energy , or if the chargino production cross - section is suppressed by the destructive interference between the @xmath106-exchange and the @xmath107-exchange diagrams . for these reasons , we think that in our analysis we can safely consider chargino masses as low as 50 gev or so . </S>",
    "<S> thus , values of @xmath108 as large as about 5 can still be obtained : we shall see in a moment how this compares with experimental data .    </S>",
    "<S> we now discuss the constraints coming from the measured values of @xmath3 and @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence on the mssm parameters is contained in the quantity @xmath58 of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ dm ] ) , so it would be desirable to obtain from the experimental data a bound on @xmath58 . on the other hand , this requires some knowledge of the parameters characterizing the mixing matrix @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> notice that we can not rely upon the sm fit to the matrix @xmath56 , since among the experimental quantities entering this fit there are precisely @xmath109 and @xmath4 , whose description now differs from the sm one .    </S>",

    "<S> higgsinos and @xmath0 are among the most plausible light supersymmetric particles , and a mass range for these states within the experimental reach of lep2 would represent an appealing scenario . at the moment , this range is still compatible with the precision electroweak data , and it could even play a role in reducing the present discrepancy concerning @xmath188 . a more systematic analysis is however required to confront this possibility with the available experimental information , including the rich input coming from flavour - changing transitions . </S>",
    "<S> the aim of this note has been to improve the existing studies , which often focus on a single specific process , by discussing all the relevant constraints , albeit in a simplified setting .    among the observables that are potentially most sensitive , we focused on the mixing parameter @xmath208 and the cp  violating parameter @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> one could have expected that , given the present experimental precision on those data , light @xmath0 and higgsinos could already be ruled out , at least for small @xmath96 . </S>",

    "<S> for example , the existence of @xmath0 and higgsinos around 60  gev would require @xmath211 for @xmath212 , @xmath213 for @xmath214 . </S>",
    "<S> this has also indirect effects on the allowed values for the neutral higgs bosons of the mssm . </S>",
    "<S> since in our limiting case the sum rule @xmath215 remains valid to quite a good accuracy after the inclusion of radiative corrections @xcite , one gets corresponding approximate upper bounds on @xmath216 . </S>",
    "<S> the mass of the lightest cp - even state could also be affected , since its tree - level value depends on @xmath217 , whilst radiative corrections @xcite are mainly controlled by the logarithmic dependence on @xmath218 , for fixed @xmath43 and @xmath96 . under our assumptions , however , we are still free to push @xmath219 to values sufficiently high that the experimental bounds can be evaded .    </S>",
    "<S> the measurement of @xmath188 at lep and the study of top decays at the tevatron can not be transformed , for the moment , into precise bounds on the mssm parameter space . in the case of @xmath188 , besides the open question of the correlation with @xmath195 , the size of the typical effects of light @xmath0 and higgsinos is considerably smaller than the discrepancy between the sm prediction and the experimental average . in the case of top </S>",
    "<S> decays , only the cdf and d0 collaborations have the appropriate tools to establish reliable bounds on exotic channels , either directly or by the extraction of @xmath220 . if , as expected , the bound setlles around @xmath221 , then the surviving region of the @xmath89 plane will allow at most for @xmath222 , a rather marginal improvement over the sm when compared with the experimental data .    finally , we recall that the parameter space discussed in section  2 starts to get significant constraints from the direct searches for stops and charginos , both at the tevatron @xcite and at lep @xcite . </S>",
