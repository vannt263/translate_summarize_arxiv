    "the taurids are a meteor shower that originates from a stream with very low inclination so that the earth is almost moving within the complex for a large fraction of its orbit and that meteors are seen on earth near to both the ascending and descending nodes .",
    "this means that the taurid complex encounters the earth two times with the duration of each resulting shower being very long . before perihelion passage it generates the night - time showers called the northern and southern taurids ( september 15  december 1 , cook , 1973 ) and in postperihelion as the daytime showers recognized by radio observations - zeta perseids and beta taurids ( may 20 ",
    "july 6 , sekanina , 1973 ) . in the beginning of the 20th century , denning ( 1928 ) recognized the complex nature of the stream , identifying thirteen active radiants situated in aries and taurus .",
    "poruban and tohl ( 1987 ) analysed all photographic data on the taurids available at that date and found a very long activity period of the stream extending in the solar longitude for almost 120 degrees .",
    "it is generally accepted ( olsson - steel , 1988 ; babadzhanov _ et al .",

    "that the stream is , in fact , a complex of several small meteor streams .",
    "some are genetically associated with comet p / encke and several to apollo asteroids . whether the apollo asteroids are associated with the comet",
    "is a more profound question that we will not discuss here .    in our analysis",
    "we have searched in the current version of the iau meteor data center catalogue of photographic orbits ( lindblad _ et al .",
    "_ , 2005 - available at _ www.astro.sk/~ne/iaumdc/ph2003/database.html_ ) for meteoroid orbits belonging to the complex .",
    "we have also searched the available data on neo s for potential parents .",
    "the taurids are rich in bright meteors thus the activity and structure of the stream is best known from photographic observations which provide also the best determined orbits . in his analysis of photographic taurids ,",
    "whipple ( 1940 ) used a sample of 14 orbits and suggested a possible relationship between the taurids and comet encke . at present , the updated iau mdc catalogue ( lindblad _ et al .",
    "_ , 2005 ) lists 4581 orbits compiled from 35 different catalogues in which 240 members of the taurid complex could be identified ( poruban , korno , 2002 ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "there is a steady increase in the number of the neos that have been discovered , amounting to over three thousand at present .",
    "these provide an additional source of potential co - parents of the complex or of individual filaments .",
    "our approach was in two steps .",
    "in the first step a computerized stream - search based on an iteration procedure and southworth - hawkins d criterion was applied to the sample of photographic orbits covering the period of activity of the complex , approx .",

    "both @xmath13 and @xmath14 can be expressed in terms of the three angular orbital elements , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , but we do not give these expressions here .    to get the cores or central parts of the streams or sub - streams a strict limiting value of @xmath18 0.1 was applied . then only filaments moving in the orbits related to the taurids considering the geocentric velocity ( @xmath195kms@xmath20 with respect to the mean geocentric velocity of the stream ) and position of the radiant ( @xmath1910@xmath21 with respect to the taurid radiant ephemeris allowed for the radiant daily motion ) were selected . in this way 23 filaments consisting of 2 to 56 members were identified .",
    "this procedure identified 210 meteors belonging to the complex as a whole , 84 to the northern branch and 126 to the southern branch .",
    "fig.1 shows the radiants of meteors of individual filaments of the northern and southern branch ( depicted by various symbols  upper plot ) .",
    "one possible way of verifying whether individual filaments can be related to the taurid complex is to reduce the radiants to a common solar longitude , e.g. corresponding to the maximum of the taurid stream activity by allowing for their radiant daily motion . for reduction ,",
    "the taurid radiant daily motion ephemeris derived by poruban and korno ( 2002 ) was applied .",
    "the radiants reduced to the solar longitude of 220@xmath21 ( lower plot ) , show the size of the radiant area for the northern and southern branch .",
    "the radiant areas of both branches are well defined , compact and form a common area of the size of about 25@xmath2215@xmath21 . the most outlying filament in january ( filament no .",
    "23 at right ascension 140@xmath21  150@xmath21 , upper plot of fig.1 ) is close to 7:2 mean - motion resonance with jupiter and may not belong to the taurid complex .",
    "due to a very long period over which the shower is active , about four months ( at least 120@xmath21 in the solar longitude ) september  december , the taurid radiant passes through several constellations . in consequence amongst the meteors identified by the above procedure as belonging to the taurids",
    "are also meteors that have been designated by the authors of other catalogues as members of other minor streams .    by comparing the mean orbits of the n piscids , the s arietids and both branches of the chi orionids with the orbit of the n and s taurids",
    "it is apparent that these streams can be regarded as extended members of the tc ( poruban and tohl , 1987 ) .    in the later work ,",
    "we have considered only filaments that contain four members at least .",
    "this gives 15 filaments and their mean orbits , radiants , geocentric velocities and corresponding tisserand invariant values ( with respect to the jupiter s orbit ) are given in tab.1 .",

    "was represented by 18 modeled particles distributed equidistantly along the orbit of the stream in the mean anomaly by 20 degrees .",
    "the mean radiants of the filaments listed in tab.1 ( open circles ) and positions of the theoretical meteor radiants of the associated neos ( stars ) calculated for the osculating orbits are plotted in fig.2 .",
    "the orbital elements of the neos are listed in tab.3 .",
    "based on the similarity of the orbital evolution , the tc sub - streams ( filaments ) can be arranged into four groups , which at the same time correspond to different values of the tisserand invariant @xmath23 ( with respect to jupiter s orbit ) . in order of the increasing @xmath23 ( tab.1 ) can be arranged as : ( i ) - the first group with @xmath26 is formed by filaments 11 , 12 and 14 ; ( ii ) - the second and the most numerous group has @xmath23 in the interval of 3.09  3.26 and consists of filaments 2 , 3 , 6 , 9 , 10 , 13 and 15 ; ( iii ) - the third group is formed by two filaments 5 and 7 with @xmath23 between 3.37  3.49 ; ( iv ) - the fourth group consisting of filaments 1 , 4 and 8 , has the largest @xmath23 between 3.73  4.23 .",
    "the most important of the elements when considering orbital evolution are the semimajor axis @xmath27 and aphelion distance @xmath28 which characterize the distance of the filament from the jupiter s orbit .",
    "these influence the amplitudes and rates of changes of the elements @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath15 during the integration .",
    "the first two groups ( i and ii ) have tisserand invariant close to p / encke ( @xmath31 ) while the groups iii and iv are with their @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath23 on typically asteroidal orbits .",
    "filaments 6 and 15 ( group ii ) are close to 4:1 mean motion resonance with jupiter and this causes a large dispersion of the modeled particles in the evolution of both streams .",
    "filament 14 has a very high aphelion distance ( 4.9 au ) , the particles approach jupiter and many of them are disturbed .",
    "the best defined association is for filament 4 and 2003qc10 with a very low @xmath2 for the whole period of integration and the association is on a typical asteroidal orbit .",
    "the next one is the association between filament 10 and 2004tg10 which has @xmath32 for the last 2200 years and their lines of apsides are very close for the whole period of integration .",
    "whipple s suggestion that comet encke is one fragment of a giant comet which disintegrated in the distant past gained support when in october 2005 asteroid 2005 tf50 was discovered ( spahr , 2005 ) .",
    "the asteroid is moving close to encke ( tab.3 ) .",
    "though the orbit of 2005tf50 is still rather uncertain , the orbital evolution of comet encke and 2005tf50 ( not considering non - gravitational effects ) is calculated and shown in fig.7 ( upper six plots ) .",
    "2005tf50 is close to 7:2 resonance with jupiter .",
    "following the orbital evolution of 2p / encke and taurid filaments , the closest similarity in evolution between the comet and filaments is for filaments 7 , 9 and 10 , which contain 28 , 56 and 38 meteors ( tab.1 ) the richest filaments of the complex and correspond to the early s tau ( 7 ) , main s tau ( 9 ) and main n tau ( 10 ) branches of the complex .",
    "all the three filaments have the tisserand invariant value close to that of encke .",
    "the last two plots of fig.7 show comparison of encke and the filaments as evolution in the differences of @xmath33 and @xmath25 .",
    "the orientation of the lines of apsides of filaments 9 and 10 with respect to encke remains practically the same over the whole period of integration and all three filaments had the same orientation about 4000  4500 years ago .",
    "at the same time small @xmath33 values for filament 7 and 10 in this period may suggest a possible origin of both filaments from encke at this time .",
    "another enrichment of filament 10 from comet encke may have occured about 1200 years ago .",
    "filament 9 could have originated from encke about 2500 years ago ( smallest @xmath33 ) but more probably earlier , more than 5000 years ago .      applying a strict value of the southworth - hawkins d - criterion ( @xmath32 ) to photographic orbits of the meteor data center catalogue - version 2003 , 23 tc filaments containing from 2 to 56 members ( 210 meteors ) were identified .",
    "15 taurid meteor complex filaments contain more than three meteors each and these were searched for potential parents .",
    "the complex forms a very broad stream active for almost four months ( fig.2 ) , 120@xmath21 in solar longitude .",
    "the radiant area of the complex reduced to the common solar longitude of @xmath34 is @xmath35 .",
    "following the orbital evolution backwards over 5000 years , possible associations between 7 tc filaments and 9 neos were found and the most probable are for filaments ( 04 ) : s psc(b )  2003qc10 , ( 10 ) : n tau(a )  2004tg10 , ( 11 ) : @xmath1 ori  2003ul3 and ( 12 ) : n tau(b )  2002xm35 .",
    "the most close associations between 2p / encke and taurid filaments were found for filaments 7 ( the earlier branch of s tau ) , 9 ( the main branch of s tau ) and 10 ( the main branch of n tau ) . filaments 7 and 10 originated from the comet about 4000  4500 years ago and filament 10 was enriched about 1200 years ago , filament 9 originated from comet probably still before 5000 years ago ."
