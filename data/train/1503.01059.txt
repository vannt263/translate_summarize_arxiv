    "neutrinos , the products of radioactive decay among other things , are somewhat enigmatic , since they can travel enormous distances through matter without interacting even once . understanding their properties in detail is fundamentally important . notwithstanding",
    "that they are so very difficult to observe , great progress in this field has been achieved in recent decades .",
    "the study of neutrinos is opening a path for the generalization of the so - called standard model that explains most of what we know about elementary particles and their interactions , but in the view of most physicists is incomplete .",
    "the standard model of electroweak interactions , developed in late 1960s , incorporates neutrinos ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) as left - handed partners of the three families of charged leptons ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) .",
    "since weak interactions are the only way neutrinos interact with anything , the unneeded right - handed components of the neutrino field are absent in the model by definition and neutrinos are assumed to be massless , with the individual lepton number ( i.e. the number of leptons of a given flavor or family ) being strictly conserved .",
    "this assignment was supported by the lack of observation of decays like @xmath7 or @xmath8 , despite the long search for them .    the discovery of neutrino oscillations over the past several decades proved that these assumptions were incorrect . that discovery represents one of the very few instances that show that the standard model is indeed incomplete .",
    "the phenomenon of neutrino oscillations means that neutrinos have a finite mass , albeit very small , and that lepton flavor is not a conserved quantity .",
    "box 1 explains the basic physics of neutrino oscillations and their relation with neutrino masses , and introduces the parameters used in the oscillation formalism .",
    "determination of all their values , with ever increasing accuracy , was and continues to be the main goal of neutrino experiments .",
    "the current experimental values of the mass - squared differences @xmath9 and the mixing angles @xmath10 can be found in the latest editions of the review of particle physics  @xcite and is also shown in box 1 .",
    "historically , the concept of neutrino oscillations was first considered by pontecorvo  @xcite and by maki , nakagawa and sakata  @xcite , hence the neutrino mixing matrix is usually called the pmns matrix .",
    "the study of reactor neutrinos played a very significant part in the discovery and detailed study of neutrino oscillations and will continue to be essential to its further progress . here",
    "we briefly review the main points of this saga . fig .",
    "[ fig : intro1 ] illustrates how the flavor composition of the reactor neutrino flux , starting as pure @xmath11 at production ( see the next section for details ) , is expected to oscillate as a function of distance .",
    "experimental verification of this behavior , and quantitative analysis of the results , are the main topics discussed below .",
    "* illustration of neutrino oscillations . *",
    "the expected flavor composition of the reactor neutrino flux , for neutrinos of 4 mev energy used as an example , is plotted as a function of distance to the reactor cores .",
    "the fraction of neutrino flavors is calculated based on the neutrino oscillation theory introduced in box 1 .",
    "reactor neutrino oscillation experiments are placed at different baselines to measure the oscillation features driven by different mechanisms .",
    "the experiments are usually categorized as : very short - baseline ( @xmath12 m ) ; short - baseline ( @xmath13 m ) ; kilometer - baseline ( @xmath14 km ) ; medium - baseline ( @xmath15 km ) ; and long - baseline ( @xmath16 km ) experiments . details of the past and future reactor experiments , their goals and achievements , are the main topics of this review . ]    the existence of neutrinos was predicted by pauli already in 1930  @xcite in his famous letter attempting to explain the continuous electron energy distribution in nuclear beta decay . however , it was not until 19531959 that reines and cowan  @xcite were able to show that neutrinos were real particles .",
    "their observation used the electron antineutrinos emitted by a nuclear reactor and started a long tradition of fundamental discoveries using reactor @xmath17 s .    in the early experiments detectors",
    "were placed at distances @xmath18 m  @xcite ( for a review see  @xcite ) .",
    "these pioneering short - baseline experiments , in agreement with the later established three - neutrino oscillation theory , did not observe variations with distance , but they were important for the understanding of the reactor neutrino flux and spectrum .",
    "the kamland experiment  @xcite in the 2000s convincingly showed that the earlier solar neutrino measurements were indeed caused by oscillations .",
    "it demonstrated for the first time that the reactor neutrinos indeed oscillate , i.e. that the @xmath17 component changes with @xmath19 , as explained in box 1 .",
    "it also allowed the most accurate determination of the mass - squared difference @xmath20 .    in the next generation of reactor experiments including daya bay  @xcite , reno  @xcite and double chooz  @xcite ,",
    "the longstanding puzzle of the value of the mixing angle @xmath0 was successfully resolved ; it turns out that its value @xmath21 ( or @xmath22 = 0.093  @xcite ) is not as small as many physicists expected .",
    "that discovery opened opportunities for further experiments that should eventually let us determine the so - far missing fundamental features of the oscillations , the neutrino mass hierarchy , and the phase @xmath23 that characterizes the possible cp ( charge and parity ) violation .",
    "the planned reactor experiments , juno  @xcite and reno-50  @xcite , promise to be an important step on this path .",
    "most of the oscillation results are well described by the simple three - neutrino generation hypothesis . however , there are a few anomalous indications , the so - called reactor antineutrino anomaly  @xcite among them , that can not be explained this way",
    ". if confirmed , they would indicate the existence of additional fourth , or fifth , and so on neutrino families called sterile neutrinos .",
    "these neutrinos lack weak interactions and would be observable only when mixing with the familiar active neutrinos . the proposed very short - baseline reactor experiments at distances @xmath2410 m will test whether this fascinating possibility is realistic or not .",
    "the discovery of neutrino oscillations is one of the most important events in the field of particle physics at the present time . in this work",
    "we briefly review the contribution to this achievement of the experiments involving neutrinos emitted by nuclear reactors .",
    "first , we show how the reactor flux and its spectrum are determined .",
    "then , we describe the success of the kamland experiment that is complementary to the exploration of solar neutrino oscillations , and the determination of the smallest mixing angle @xmath0 using three independent reactor experiments .",
    "while those achievements involved considerable effort , answering the remaining open questions is even more complicated .",
    "we begin by describing the planned large reactor experiments , juno and reno-50 , aiming at the difficult determination of the so far unknown neutrino mass hierarchy or mass ordering .",
    "we then touch on the future very short - baseline reactor experiments aiming to test the tentative and unexpected possibility that additional light sterile neutrinos might exist .",
    "nuclear reactors derive their power from fission .",
    "the fission fragments are neutron rich and undergo a cascade of @xmath25 decays .",
    "each fission is accompanied by approximately 6 @xmath25 decays , producing an electron and electron antineutrino each .",
    "the decay energy , typical for the nuclear @xmath25 decay , is a few mevs , rarely exceeding @xmath248 mev .",
    "since a typical power reactor core has thermal power of about 3 gw@xmath26 , and produces @xmath24 200 mev of energy in each fission , the typical yield of @xmath17 at equilibrium is @xmath27 core@xmath28 s@xmath28 .",
    "reactors are therefore powerful sources of low energy @xmath17 s .",
    "neutrinos can be detected through charged current interactions when they produce charged particles , electron ( mass 0.511 mev ) , muon ( mass 105.7 mev ) or tau ( mass 1776.8 mev ) , with neutrino energy sufficient to produce them . the reactor @xmath17 energy is low , thus only reactions producing positrons are possible .",
    "hence , to study neutrino oscillations with nuclear reactors , one must use the disappearance type of tests , i.e.  measure the flux as a function of the distance @xmath29 and energy @xmath30 ( see box  1 for the detailed formalism ) and look for the deviation from the simple geometrical scaling .",
    "traditionally such measurements were compared with the expected @xmath17 spectrum of the reactor .",
    "good knowledge of that spectrum , its normalization and the associated uncertainties , is essential in that case . to reduce the dependence on the knowledge of the reactor spectrum , more recent experiments @xcite use two essentially similar detectors , one nearer the reactor and another farther away .",
    "there are two principal and complementary ways to evaluate antineutrino spectra associated with fission .",
    "the summation method uses known cumulative fission yields @xmath31 , and combines them with the experimentally known ( or theoretically deduced ) branching ratios @xmath32 of all @xmath25-decay branches with endpoints @xmath33 and a normalized shape function of each of these many thousands of @xmath25 decays , @xmath34 , @xmath35 there are several difficulties with this method .",
    "the branching ratios and endpoint energies are sometimes poorly known at best , in particular for the short - lived fragments with large @xmath36 values and many branches .",
    "the individual spectrum shape functions @xmath34 require description of the coulomb distortions including the nuclear finite size effects , weak magnetism , and radiative corrections .",
    "in addition , not all decays are of the allowed type .",
    "there are numerous ( about 25% ) first forbidden decays involving parity change , where the individual spectrum shapes are much more difficult to evaluate .",
    "* detection of reactor @xmath17 . * in the bottom of the figure , the reactor @xmath17 flux from the individual isotopes  @xcite , weighted by their typical contribution to the total flux in a commercial reactor , is shown .",
    "the detection of @xmath17 relies on the inverse beta decay reaction , whose cross section  @xcite is shown as the blue curve .",
    "their product is the interaction spectrum measured by the detectors , shown as the red curve .",
    "the steps involved in the detection are schematically drawn in the top of the figure .",
    "the @xmath17 interacts with a proton , becoming a positron ( @xmath37 ) and a neutron .",
    "the @xmath37 quickly deposits its energy and annihilates into two 511-kev @xmath38-rays , which gives a prompt signal .",
    "the neutron scatters in the detector until being thermalized .",
    "it is then captured by a proton @xmath24 200 @xmath39s later and releases a 2.2-mev @xmath38-ray ( the capture time can be significantly reduced by the doping of isotopes with very large neutron capture cross section such as gadolinium ) .",
    "the detection of this prompt - delayed signal pair indicates an @xmath17 candidate . ]",
    "the other method uses the experimentally determined spectrum of electrons associated with fission of the principal reactor fuels .",
    "that spectrum has been measured at ill grenoble for the thermal neutron fission of @xmath40u , @xmath41pu and @xmath42pu  @xcite and recently also for the fast neutron fission of @xmath43u in munich  @xcite .",
    "these electron spectra are then transformed into the @xmath17 spectra using the obvious fact that these two leptons share the total energy of each @xmath25-decay branch .",
    "the transformation is on the basis of fitting first the electron spectra to a set of 30 or more virtual branches , with the equidistant endpoint spacing , determining from the fit their branching ratios .",
    "the conversion to the @xmath17 spectrum is performed in each of these virtual branches .",
    "that conversion is based on the assumption that the electron spectrum is known precisely . when all virtual branches are put together one has to also take into account that different nuclear charges @xmath44 contribute with different weights to different electron and @xmath17 energies .",
    "while the conversion would introduce only minimum uncertainty if all decays would be of the allowed shape , the presence of the first forbidden decays introduces additional uncertainty whose magnitude is difficult to determine accurately .",
    "the summation method was used initially in  @xcite and in the more recent version in  @xcite .",
    "the conversion method was first used in  @xcite , more details can be found in  @xcite and the more recent version in  @xcite .",
    "naturally , the thermal power of the reactor and its time - changing fuel composition must be known , as must the energy associated with fissions of the isotopes @xmath40u , @xmath41pu , @xmath45pu and @xmath43u . in addition , as already mentioned , small corrections to the spectrum shape of individual @xmath25-decay branches due to the radiative correction , weak magnetism , nuclear size , and so on must be correctly included .",
    "difficult to do accurately , but of a particular importance , is to take into account the spectrum shape of the numerous first forbidden @xmath25 decays  @xcite .",
    "the overall uncertainty in the flux was estimated in  @xcite to be @xmath24 2% , but when the first forbidden decays are included it is estimated in ref .",
    "@xcite that the uncertainty increases to @xmath24 5% .    in essentially all reactor",
    "neutrino oscillation studies , the @xmath17 are detected using the inverse neutron @xmath25-decay reaction @xmath46 whose cross section is accurately known  @xcite and depends primarily on the known neutron decay half - life .",
    "( at the same time the recoil , radiative corrections etc .",
    ", must be also be taken into account . ) since the neutron is so much heavier than the available energy , its kinetic energy is quite small ( tens of kev ) and thus the principal observables are the number and energy of the positrons .",
    "most importantly , the correlated observation of the positrons and the delayed neutron captures is a powerful tool for background suppression .",
    "note that the reaction ( [ eq : detection ] ) has a threshold of 1.8 mev , only @xmath17 with energy larger than that can produce positrons .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] we illustrate the energy dependence of the reactor @xmath17 flux , the detection reaction cross section and their product , i.e. the measured antineutrino spectrum .",
    "the contributions of the individual isotopes to the @xmath17 flux , weighted by their typical contribution to the reactor power are also shown .",
    "the top part of the figure schematically indicates the steps involved in the @xmath17 capture on proton reaction .",
    "since the late 1960s , a series of solar neutrino experiments  @xcite , using charged current reactions , have observed a large deficit of solar @xmath1 flux relative to the standard solar model ( ssm )  @xcite prediction .",
    "it appeared that more than half of the solar neutrinos were missing .",
    "this was referred to as the `` solar neutrino problem '' . in 2001 ,",
    "the sno solar neutrino experiment  @xcite , for the first time , successfully measured the total flux of all three neutrino flavors ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) through the neutral current channel @xmath47 using heavy water as a target , that yielded results consistent with the ssm .",
    "the sno result is considered the `` smoking gun '' evidence of the neutrino oscillation explanation to the solar neutrino problem  the solar neutrinos , produced as electron - neutrinos from fusion and other reactions in the central region of the sun , are transformed into other flavors when they arrive at the earth .",
    "the solar neutrino experiments allowed several possible solutions in the oscillation parameter space of @xmath48 and @xmath20 .",
    "a precise measurement of these parameters and demonstration of the oscillatory feature , however , was hindered by the relatively large uncertainty of the solar @xmath49 flux predicted by the ssm , the large matter effect inside the sun , and the extremely long distance the neutrinos travel .",
    "a reactor neutrino experiment , measuring the same disappearance channel as the solar neutrino experiments assuming @xmath50 invariance , overcomes these difficulties . with well - understood and controllable @xmath24mev @xmath11",
    "source , a reactor experiment at @xmath24100 km baselines can explore with high precision the so - called `` large mixing angle ( lma ) '' parameter region suggested by the solar neutrino experiments . to do that , the kamland experiment  @xcite was built in early 2000s to explore the solar neutrino oscillations on earth .    to shield against cosmic rays ,",
    "the kamland detector was placed at the site of the former kamiokande experiment  @xcite under the summit of mt .",
    "ikenoyama in the japanese alps .",
    "the vertical overburden is 2700-m water - equivalent ( m.w.e ) .",
    "it is surrounded by 55 japanese nuclear reactor cores , which then produced about 30% of the total electricity in japan .",
    "the @xmath11 flux - weighted average baseline is about 180 km , well suited for kamland to study the parameters suggested by the solar neutrino experiments .",
    "the reactor operation information such as thermal power , fuel burn - up , and fuel exchange and enrichment records were provided by all japanese reactors , which allowed kamland to calculate the instantaneous fission rate of each isotope accurately .",
    "the kamland detector consists of 1 kton of highly purified liquid scintillator ( ls ) , enclosed in a 13-m - diameter transparent balloon suspended by ropes in mineral oil ( mo ) .",
    "the mo is housed inside a 18-m - diameter stainless steel ( ss ) sphere , where an array of 1325 17-inch and 554 20-inch photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) is mounted .",
    "the mo shields the inner ls region from external radiation from pmts and ss .",
    "purified water ( 3.2 kton ) is used to provide further shielding against ambient radiation and operates as an active cosmic muon veto detector . with regular central - axis deployments of radioactive sources and dedicated off - axis deployments  @xcite , kamland achieved an excellent position resolution of @xmath51 @xmath52 , energy resolution of @xmath53 , and absolute energy - scale uncertainty of 1.4% .",
    "even with such powerful reactor @xmath11 sources and a massive detector , the long baseline suppresses the expected signal at kamland to only about one reactor @xmath11 event per day . in comparison ,",
    "the background from internal and external radioactivity is one million times higher .",
    "the experiment is only possible owing to the powerful coincidence signature ( the positron followed by the delayed neutron capture @xmath38 ) of inverse beta decay , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] .",
    "a time difference of less than 1 millisecond and distance less than 2 meters between the prompt and delayed signals is required in the analysis .",
    "only the innermost 6-m - radius scintillator region is used to reduce the accidental coincidence from external radioactivity .",
    "information about the event energy , position , and time were used to further reduce the accidental background to @xmath245% of the candidates .",
    "the other dominant background ( @xmath2410% ) at kamland is caused by the @xmath54c@xmath55o reaction where the @xmath56-decay comes from @xmath57po , a decay product of @xmath58rn that is naturally present in the air and many materials as traces , but is sufficient to induce a measurable contamination of the scintillator during its production . the neutron scattering off proton or @xmath59o@xmath60 de - excitation produces a prompt signal , followed by a neutron capture delayed signal .",
    "this then mimics a true @xmath11 event .",
    "the rest of the backgrounds include the following : the antineutrinos produced in the decay chains of @xmath61th and @xmath43u in the earth s mantle and crust , so - called geoneutrinos ; the cosmogenic beta - delayed neutron emitters @xmath62li and @xmath63he ; the fast neutrons from muons passing through the surrounding rock , as well as atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "[ fig : kamland ] ( a ) shows the prompt energy spectrum of @xmath11 candidate events , observed with 2.9 kton@xmath64year exposure , overlaid with the expected reactor @xmath65 and background spectra .",
    "a total of 1609 events were observed , which is only about 60% of the expected signal if there are no oscillations .",
    "the ratio of the background - subtracted @xmath11 candidate events to no - oscillation expectation is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : kamland ] ( b ) as a function of @xmath19 .",
    "the spectrum indicates almost two cycles of the periodic feature expected from neutrino oscillations , strongly disfavoring other explanations of the @xmath11 disappearance .",
    "the kamland results  @xcite are highly consistent with the solar neutrino experiments , and have pinned down the solar neutrino oscillation solution to the lma region . when combined with the results from sno",
    ", they yield the most precise measurements of @xmath66 and @xmath67 ev@xmath68 .",
    "this is a great example of the complementarity between different types of experiments .",
    "the sno and kamland s first results came out within approximately 18 months of each other , with the solar experiment being more sensitive to the mixing angle @xmath48 and the reactor experiment to the mass - squared difference @xmath20 .",
    "the observation of the same effect with two different sources on such different scales provides compelling evidence for neutrino oscillations .",
    "in contrast to the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix in quark mixing , where all three mixing angles are very small  @xcite , the mixing angles in the neutrino mixing matrix appear to be large : @xmath69 , measured by the atmospheric  @xcite and long - baseline accelerator  @xcite neutrino experiments , is consistent with @xmath70 which corresponds to maximal mixing ; and @xmath48 , measured by the solar neutrino experiments and kamland , is about @xmath71 .",
    "it was therefore natural to expect that the third mixing angle , @xmath0 , might be of similar magnitude .        the cleanest way to measure",
    "@xmath0 is through kilometer - baseline reactor neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "a non - zero @xmath0 will cause a deficit of @xmath11 flux at approximately 12 kilometer baseline , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : intro1 ] .",
    "the size of the deficit is directly proportional to the value of @xmath72 . unlike accelerator neutrino experiments ,",
    "the reactor measurements are independent of the cp phase and @xmath69 , and only slightly dependent on the neutrino mass hierarchy and matter effect . a high precision measurement can therefore be achieved .    in the 1990s ,",
    "two first - generation kilometer - baseline reactor experiments , chooz  @xcite and palo verde  @xcite were constructed to measure @xmath0 .",
    "the chooz detector was built at a distance of @xmath241050 m from the two reactors of the chooz power plant of lectricit de france in the ardennes region of france .",
    "it took data from april 1997 to july 1998 .",
    "the palo verde detector was built at distances of 750 , 890 and 890 m from the three reactors of the palo verde nuclear generating station in the arizona desert of the united states .",
    "it took data between october 1998 and july 2000 .",
    "surprisingly , neither experiment was able to observe the @xmath11 deficit caused by @xmath0 oscillation . as a result , only an upper limit of @xmath73 at 90% c.l .",
    "was obtained  @xcite .    the null results from chooz and palo verde , combined with the measured values of @xmath69 and @xmath48 , motivated many phenomenological speculations of neutrino mixing patterns such as bimaximal and tribimaximal mixing  @xcite .",
    "in most of these theories , @xmath0 is either zero or very small .",
    "a direct consequence of a vanishing @xmath0 is that the cp violation in the leptonic sector , even if large , can never be observed in the neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "the importance of knowing the precise value of @xmath0 provoked a series of world - wide second - generation kilometer - baseline reactor experiments in the twenty - first century , including double chooz  @xcite in france , reno  @xcite in korea and daya bay  @xcite in china , to push the sensitivity to @xmath0 considerably below @xmath74 .",

    "background control is a challenging task in the vsbr experiments .",
    "the detectors are typically at shallow depth ( @xmath2410 m.w.e . )  constrained by the locations of the reactor cores .",
    "the cosmic - ray related background is therefore high .",
    "one advantage of using research reactors is that they can be turned on or off on demand , which helps to measure the non - reactor background .",
    "the reactor - related backgrounds , such as fast neutrons and high energy gamma rays , are however more difficult to determine as they appear together with the @xmath11 signals .",
    "sufficient active veto and passive shielding are necessary .",
    "however , given the tight space near the reactor cores , they have to be carefully designed .",
    "as shown in table  [ tab : sterile ] , detectors are typically gd - loaded or @xmath75li - loaded liquid ( or solid ) scintillators .",
    "the gd - ls technology is mature and a good pulse shape discrimination ( psd ) against the neutron background has been demonstrated .",
    "an advantage of the @xmath75li - loaded scintillator is that the delayed neutron capture process @xmath75li@xmath76 produces an @xmath56 particle and a triton , instead of a @xmath38-ray .",
    "this provides a good localization of the delayed signal and an additional psd against the @xmath38 background .",
    "some detectors are highly segmented into small cells in order to achieve good position resolution and further background rejection by using the multi - cell event topologies .",
