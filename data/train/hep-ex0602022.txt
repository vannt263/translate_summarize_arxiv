    "the nomad experiment was designed to search for @xmath0 appearance from neutrino oscillations in the cern wide - band neutrino beam produced by the 450 gev proton synchrotron .",
    "the single - particle reconstruction and lepton identification capability of the nomad detector allowed the search for @xmath0 appearance in most of the leptonic and hadronic @xmath1 decay channels  @xcite and also to look for @xmath2 oscillations  @xcite .",
    "no evidence for oscillations was found .",
    "the high resolution and reconstruction quality makes the nomad data samples a valuable resource for the neutrino physics community .",
    "the recent measurements of cross - sections and particle production would help to clarify our understanding of neutrino interactions with nuclei at intermediate energies .",
    "in addition , it must be noted the precise tracking in a light target provides a powerful tool to tune and validate monte carlo simulation programs for future experiments .",
    "this analysis activity can benefit from the beam and detector studies performed for the oscillation searches .",
    "the nomad detector is described in detail in ref .  @xcite . inside a 0.4 t magnetic field",
    "there is an active target consisting of drift chambers ( dc )  @xcite with a fiducial mass of about 2.7 tons and a low average density ( 0.1 g/@xmath3 ) . the main target , 405 cm long and corresponding to about one radiation length ,",
    "is followed by a transition radiation detector ( trd )  @xcite for electron identification , a preshower detector ( prs ) , and a high resolution lead - glass electromagnetic calorimeter ( ecal )  @xcite .",
    "a hadron calorimeter ( hcal ) and two stations of drift chambers for muon detection are located just after the downstream part of the magnet coil .",
    "an iron - scintillator sampling calorimeter with a fiducial mass of about 17@xmath4 ( fcal ) is located upstream of the central part of the nomad target .",
    "the detector is designed to identify leptons and to measure muons , pions , electrons and photons with comparable resolutions .",
    "momenta are measured in the dc with a resolution : @xmath5}}\\oplus \\frac{0.008 \\times p[gev / c]}{\\sqrt{l[m]^5}}\\ ] ] where l is the track length and @xmath6 is the momentum . the energy of electromagnetic showers , @xmath7 , is measured in the ecal with a resolution : @xmath8}}.\\ ] ]    the relative composition of charged current ( cc ) events in nomad is estimated  @xcite to be @xmath9,:@xmath10,:@xmath11,:@xmath12 = 1.00 : 0.0227 : 0.0154 : 0.0016 , with average neutrino energies of 45.4 , 40.8 , 57.5 , and 51.5 gev , respectively .",
    "neutrinos are produced at an average distance of 625 m from the detector .    the nomad experiment collected data from 1995 to 1998 .",
    "most of the running , for a total exposure of @xmath13 protons on target ( pot ) , was in neutrino mode .",
    "this resulted in three distinct data samples , according to the different targets : @xmath14 cc interactions from the drift chambers ( mainly carbon ) , @xmath15 cc interactions from the region of the magnet coil ( mainly aluminium ) located in front of the dc and @xmath16 cc interactions from fcal ( iron ) .",
    "at large momentum transfer structure functions are described as series in @xmath18 on the basis of the operator product expansion of the correlator of the weak current ( twist expansion ) : @xmath19 where @xmath20 refers to the type of the structure function , @xmath21 are the leading twist ( lt ) terms corrected for the target mass effects and @xmath22 are the higher twist ( ht ) terms of twist @xmath4 .",
    "the target mass corrections are computed using the approach of ref.@xcite ( see also @xcite for the treatment of the thereshold problem at @xmath23 ) .",
    "the calculation of the leading twist is performed in the nnlo approximation and we include additional phenomenological terms up to twist-6 .",
    "we use pdfs and ht based on ref.@xcite , obtained from dedicated fits optimized at low @xmath17  @xcite and including additional data from ( anti)neutrinos cc ( nomad , chorus  @xcite and nutev  @xcite ) and charged lepton ( jlab ) deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) , as well as from drell - yan production ( e605 and e886 ) .      in the low-@xmath24 region ( anti)neutrino cross sections are dominated by the longitudinal structure function @xmath25 and the latter is driven by the axial - current interactions .",
    "the structure function @xmath26 vanishes as @xmath17 at low @xmath17 .",
    "this behaviour is similar to the charged lepton case and holds for both the vector and the axial - vector contributions .",
    "however , in the longitudinal channel the low-@xmath24 behavior of the vector and axial - vector parts are different .",
    "the conservation of the vector current ( cvc ) suggests @xmath27 for the vector current part of hadronic tensor . from this condition",
    "we conclude @xmath28 vanishes faster than @xmath29 at low @xmath17 and @xmath30 .",
    "this behavior is similar to the charged - lepton case .",
    "in contrast to the vector current , the axial - vector current is not conserved . for low momentum transfer",
    "the divergence of the axial - vector current is proportional to the pion field ( partially conserved axial current or pcac ) @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the pion mass and @xmath33 is the pion decay constant and @xmath34 is the pion field in the corresponding charge state . we introduce explicitely a pcac contribution to @xmath35 : @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 is the total cross section for the scattering of a virtual pion with momentum @xmath40 and the center - of - mass energy squared @xmath41 . the last term @xmath42",
    "is similar to @xmath28 and vanishes as @xmath43 .",
    "since the pcac contribution is expected to vanish at high @xmath17 we introduce a form factor @xmath44 , where the dipole form is motivated by meson dominance arguments .",
    "it is important to note the pion pole does not directly contribute to structure functions and hence the mass scale controlling the pcac mechanism , @xmath45 , can not be the pion mass itself , but is rather related to higher mass states like @xmath46 , @xmath47 etc .",
    "we use the simple assumption @xmath48  @xcite .",
    "the structure functions @xmath26 and @xmath49 , which are vanishing for @xmath50 like in the charged lepton case , are parameterized as smooth interpolations between the high @xmath17 regime calculated from equation  [ eq : sfs ] and the @xmath50 predictions derived from current conservation arguments  @xcite@xcite .",
    "we choose the value @xmath51 as matching point for the twist expansion . in the region",
    "@xmath52 we use cubic splines calculated for fixed @xmath53 values .",
    "the coefficients of such functions are fully determined by the condition both functions and derivatives should match with the twist expansion at @xmath54 .",
    "figure  [ fig : lowq ] illustrates the interpolation procedure for @xmath55 on protons in charged lepton scattering .    .",
    "the example given in the plot refers to @xmath55 for charged lepton scattering on protons at x=0.07 ( see text for details ) . ]",
    "the different @xmath17 dependence of various terms in equation  [ eq : sfs ] allows to disentangle higher twist contributions , which are parameterized as smooth functions ( splines ) of @xmath53 .",
    "our results indicate the twist-6 term @xmath56 is important in order to describe the ratio @xmath57 of longitudinal to transverse cross - sections at low @xmath17 .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig : rcl ] together with slac and jlab data .",
    "we derive the ratio @xmath57 directly from the parameterizations of @xmath25 and @xmath26 .     for charged lepton scattering .",
    "data from slac and jlab are shown for comparison . ]    from the relation @xmath58 and ( [ fl : ac ] ) it follows that the structure function @xmath55 at low @xmath17 is dominated by the nonvanishing @xmath59 term ( figure  [ fig : f2pcac ] ) .",
    "it is important to note that since @xmath60 and @xmath61 in the limit of vanishing @xmath17 the ratio @xmath62 is divergent for neutrino interactions .",
    "this is substantially different from the scattering of charged leptons for which @xmath57 is vanishing as @xmath17 .     at @xmath63 for different targets . ]",
    "the determination of lt and ht terms is performed from all available data with @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "it is interesting to check the extrapolation of dis structure functions into the resonance region .",
    "the results are consistent with the duality principle , as can be seen from figure  [ fig : dual ] where the integral of the difference between the recent jlab resonance data and the average dis predictions is consistent with zero .",
    "structure function on proton and the recent jlab data in the resonance region . ]      a detailed calculation of nuclear corrections to structure functions is performed  @xcite@xcite .",
    "the model takes into account a number of different effects including nuclear shadowing , fermi motion and binding , nuclear pion excess and off - shell correction to bound nucleon structure functions .",
    "the off - shell effect and the effective scattering amplitude describing nuclear shadowing are expressed in terms of few parameters which are common to all nuclei and have a clear physical interpretation .",
    "the parameters are then extracted from statistical analysis of data from charged lepton scattering on a wide range of nuclear targets .",
    "the treatment of fermi motion , binding , off - shell effect and nuclear pion correction in ( anti)neutrino interactions is similar to the one in charged lepton scattering .",
    "the main differences are related to the impact of the axial - vector current on coherent nuclear effects and are more evident at low @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "one - loop electroweak effects are taken into account  @xcite as corrections to the parton distributions used in the structure function calculation .",
    "the initial quark mass singularities from qed corrections are subtracted within the @xmath66 scheme since they are effectively incorporated in the quark density functions .",
    "results are cross - checked with a second independent calculation  @xcite .",
    "two independent approaches are used to calculate neutrino fluxes .",
    "the first method is based on a simulation of the west area neutrino facility  @xcite .",
    "the calculation of particle production rates from the interaction of primary protons on @xmath67 target is performed with a recent version of fluka  @xcite , further modified to take into account the cross - sections measured by the spy and na20 experiments .",
    "these particles are then propagated through the beam line taking into account the material and magnetic fields they traverse .",
    "predictions are then validated by comparisons with nomad data .",
    "a second method relies directly upon the @xmath9 cc events reconstructed in the nomad detector . in particular , events with low energy associated to the hadronic system ( @xmath68 gev )",
    "are analyzed to this purpose since the corresponding differential distribution @xmath69 is proportional to the flux up to a small correction factor ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "the monte carlo ( mc ) simulation of neutrino dis interactions is based on lepto 6.1  @xcite and jetset 7.4  @xcite packages , followed by a full geant3  @xcite propagation to model the detector response .",
    "the neutrino cross - sections are parameterized according to the model described in the previous sections .",
    "the simulation of resonance production is performed according to ref .",

    "we do not include the parton shower treatment from jetset .",
    "the reinteractions of hadrons with surrounding nucleons in target nuclei are described within the dpmjet  @xcite package .",
    "a detailed tuning of fragmentation parameters has been performed with hadrons reconstructed in @xmath9 cc interactions  @xcite .",
    "the present knowledge of neutrino cross - sections is rather nonuniform . in the region",
    "@xmath71 gev , where data from the large massive calorimeters ( ccfr , nutev ) are available , the uncertainty is about 2% .",
    "this increases to about 20% at lower energies , due to the limited statistics of bubble chamber experiments .",
    "measurements of both the total @xmath72 and the differential @xmath73 cross - sections for @xmath9 on carbon are performed in nomad .",
    "one of the primary goals is to constrain the ( anti)neutrino cross - section model and to reduce the corresponding systematic uncertainties .",
    "this also provides the first measurement of inclusive cross - section on carbon target , with @xmath74 gev@xmath75 .",

    "[ sec : model ] ) is illustrated in figure  [ fig : nomad_dxy ] for @xmath79 gev , indicating a good agreement in the entire kinematic region .",
    "the nomad results are also consistent with the measurements performed by chorus and nutev on different targets  @xcite . only in the recent nutev data a slight excess",
    "is observed for @xmath80  @xcite .",
    "the low @xmath17 data from chorus support our treatment of the pcac contribution to neutrino structure functions .",
