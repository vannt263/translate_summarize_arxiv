    "stability of invariant circles in k.a.m .",
    "theory depends on the respective rotation number .",
    "the most stable circle has @xmath3 , the golden mean ratio , as its rotation number , all partial quotients equal @xmath4 . as in @xcite boundness of partial quotients",
    "would be a bonus in representation on a computer . here",
    "however , experiments strongly suggest the opposite . also cubic irrationals are interesting in studying quasiperiodic motion @xcite , @xcite . here",
    "we investigate @xmath0 and its adjunction ring .",
    "it is a common belief that the partial quotients of @xmath0 are not bounded , supported by extensive computations , but no proof .",
    "even more , computations suggest that their relative frequencies in the limit obey the kuzmin law @xmath5 . in @xcite",
    "several algebraic numbers were used in computations , among them @xmath6 and good accordance was found with kuzmin s statistics , for @xmath0 even too good .",
    "so later in @xcite and @xcite larger samples were taken and the anomaly seemed to disappear .",
    "we played the same game , only we had the advantage of more sophistical computation tools that evolved in the years in between .",
    "the experimental results supporting of the stronger hypothesis instigated us to try towards some theoretical results .",
    "however questions about `` big '' partial quotients still linger and tease us . though some explanation was given in a special case , using elliptic modular functions @xcite , @xcite .",
    "in this paper we work towards the proof of    * hypothesis . *",
    "the partial quotients of @xmath0 are not bounded .",
    "+ denoted as hypothesis b in @xcite .",
    "only a very limited partial result is given , helping to recognize possible convergents and estimating the next partial quotient .",
    "for convenience of the reader we repeat some definitions and notations from @xcite .    in the adjunction ring",
    "we have the unit @xmath7 and its inverse @xmath8 , @xmath9 .",
    "we span the 3-dim space @xmath1 on @xmath10 .",
    "obviously the continued fraction expansions for @xmath0 and @xmath11 differ only in the starting partial quotient , so we rather consider approximations to @xmath11 . and in order to find ever better approximations , we construct series of vector space bases for @xmath1 .",
    "multiplicative norm is defined in @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath12 , its norm is @xmath13 with @xmath14 @xmath15 and @xmath16 a third root of one .",
    "division in general leads to the corresponding field @xmath17 .",
    "carrying out the rationalization of the denominator as in @xmath18 gives the elements of @xmath17 in the form @xmath19 with @xmath20 rational fractions .",
    "as already mentioned , instead of @xmath21 we use the algebraic basis @xmath22 and elements of @xmath2 are expressed as @xmath23 or changing the basis @xmath24    now , let @xmath25 be the 3-dimensional space endowed with the usual scalar product @xmath26 and cross product @xmath27 .",
    "vectors can be written as triplets @xmath28 and define a linear mapping @xmath29 by @xmath30 , the resulting image consisting of all vectors with integer entries , multiplication inherited from @xmath2 .",
    "taking into account @xmath31 we can define the norm function in the whole @xmath1 : @xmath32    multiplication with @xmath11 will prove very important and we observe @xmath33 where @xmath34.\\ ] ] which , by the way , represents a hyperbolic toral authomorphism @xcite .",
    "the term basis comes in several ways in mathematics .",
    "our discussion needs it in two appearances :    * as the _ basis _ of a number system ( @xmath35 in our case ) , * as the _ basis _ of a vector space ( different bases of @xmath1 here ) .    the first usage figures in our paper @xcite , here we are concerned with the second one .",
    "we can think of the basis @xmath36 as the canonical one .",
    "and we shall also write @xmath37 as we shall denote @xmath38 , and noting @xmath39 we have    @xmath40 ,    @xmath41 ,    @xmath42 ,    @xmath43 ,    @xmath44 ,    @xmath45 ,    @xmath46 ,    and we may also need the ones with negative indices    @xmath47 ,    @xmath48 ,    @xmath49 ,    @xmath50 ,    @xmath51 ,    @xmath52 ,    as well as the inverse matrix @xmath53,\\ ] ] which we also meet in the jacobi - perron algorithm @xcite .    further we define the series of bases @xmath54 for all integer @xmath55 . these are good bases for our purposes as    elements of @xmath56 have integer coefficients in each basis @xmath57 .",
    "let @xmath58 be an element from @xmath56 .",
    "if we multiply expansion @xmath59 by integer element matrix @xmath60 , we get vector with integer components @xmath61    besides the series of bases @xmath57 we also define the conjugate series @xmath62 in the following manner .    for start @xmath63 and with the adjoint matrix @xmath64\\ ] ]    we define vectors @xmath65 for positive and negative indices .",
    "so we have    @xmath66 ,    @xmath67 ,    @xmath68 ,    @xmath69 ,    @xmath70 ,    @xmath71 ,    @xmath72 .    comparing with the vectors @xmath73",
    "we see that @xmath74    the bases series @xmath75 again providing integer coefficients for @xmath2",
    ". the two bases series shall be useful in further computations .",
    "the action of linear transformation @xmath76 is best understood in terms of its eigenvalues and eigenspaces .",
    "one eigenvalue is real , smaller then @xmath77 , and two are complex conjugate greater than @xmath77    @xmath78 ,    @xmath79 ,    @xmath80 .",
    "the eigenvectors being @xmath81 and @xmath82 where    @xmath83 ,    @xmath84 ,    @xmath85 .",
    "we can also compute the rotation angle @xmath86    and after some computation we can express @xmath87 and @xmath88 @xmath89    the norm ( [ norma ] ) takes zero value on the union of the eigenplane @xmath90 spanned by vectors @xmath91 , @xmath92 and the eigenline of @xmath81 . except for the origin , there is no rational point @xmath93 of zero norm .",
    "the basic vectors @xmath94 with increasing positive @xmath55 are approaching the invariant plane and for negative @xmath55 being almost colinear to the eigenvector @xmath81 .    on the other hand we can construct the eigenbasis @xmath95 and the conjugate eigenbasis .",
    "to make the conjugate eigenbasis , we compute the vector products @xmath96 and they constitute the conjugate eigenbasis @xmath97    @xmath98 ,    @xmath99 ,    @xmath100 .",
    "later we shall need also the mixed product @xmath101={-\\sqrt{3}\\over 36}=-m\\doteq-0.0481125.\\ ] ] the plane @xmath102 of the vectors @xmath103 is the invariant plane of @xmath104 .",
    "the vectors @xmath105 are eigenvectors of the matrix @xmath104 .",
    "first we find the scalar products : @xmath106 @xmath107    so it is clear @xmath108 is orthogonal to both @xmath91 and @xmath92 and therefore colinear to @xmath109 itself , therefore an eigenvector with a real eigenvalue , the only one being @xmath11 , therefore @xmath110 .",
    "the other two cases demand a little more work to tell apart the two complex eigenvalues , of course unless we want to go into direct computation .",
    "we can also express the vectors @xmath111 in terms of the conjugate eigenbasis @xmath112 and infer a connection between the basis and conjugate basis via the matrix @xmath113,\\ ] ]    namely @xmath114    and also connecting the eigenbasis with conjugate eigenbasis    @xmath115 ,    @xmath116 ,    @xmath117 .",
    "we shall also need some scalar and cross products of the basis vectors .",
    "the scalar products of basis vectors are as follows : @xmath118 with    @xmath119 ,    @xmath120 ,    @xmath121 ,    @xmath122 ,    @xmath123 ,    @xmath124 .    since @xmath125",
    "we only need to read off the first component of @xmath94 as @xmath63 .    for two consecutive basis vectors",
    "we have the cross product @xmath126 and if we jump by one index @xmath127    setting unknown coefficients @xmath128 @xmath129 and taking scalar products in turn with @xmath130 we get @xmath131 @xmath132 @xmath133 and from here @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "likewise we prove the second formula .",
    "the vector @xmath136 can as any vector be expanded in any basis @xmath57 and with integer coefficients .    in @xcite , using @xmath35 basis , we expressed @xmath137 with a wider choice of vectors , but coefficients being limited to 0,1,2 or 3 : @xmath138 .",
    "whereas here , since each time only 3 vectors form the basis , we allow all integer coefficients .    should @xmath139 be a convergent to @xmath11 , we can control the size of the these coefficients , provided @xmath55 has been chosen appropriately .",
    "let @xmath139 be a convergent to @xmath11 and @xmath140 the coordinates of @xmath141 in the basis @xmath57 .",
    "this basis is called _ appropriate for the convergent _ , when the vector @xmath142 is the shortest for some positive integer @xmath55 .    from the table of convergents",
    "@xcite we take @xmath143 that is just preceding the relatively big partial quotient @xmath144 , so that @xmath145 in the estimate @xmath146 .    which @xmath55 take , to make the vector @xmath147 shortest ? here are some results in the table 1 .",
    "[ tab1 ]    .appropriate vector [ cols=\">,>,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we carried out the shortest vector algorithm for @xmath148 until @xmath149 .",
    "the resulting @xmath150 were , as shown in the dotted figure [ fig : gr2 ] , all below 1 .",
    "only 21 of them did not result in continued fraction approximants ( marked with squares ) .",
    "resulting from the shortest vector algorithm , width=377 ]",
    "we applied @xmath151-test to compare observed frequencies of partial quotients of @xmath0 with theoretical frequencies @xmath5 . using @xcite we computed 75000 partial quotients and divided them into @xmath152 groups consisting of numbers 1 , 2 , 3 ,  , @xmath153 and of all numbers over @xmath153 .",
    "let @xmath154 be the observed frequency of the @xmath155 group and @xmath156 its expected frequency .",
    "the value of the test statistic is @xmath157 if the partial quotients the hypothesized distribution , @xmath158 has , approximately , a @xmath151 distribution with @xmath153 degrees of freedom .",
    "the resulting p - values for different degrees of freedom are shown in the figure [ hi - test ] .",
