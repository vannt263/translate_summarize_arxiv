    "the idea of an energy cascade through a hierarchy of scales ( richardson 1922 ; kolmogorov 1941a ; obukhov 1941 ) , the phenomenological theory of turbulent energy dissipation ( kolmogorov 1941a , b , 1942 ) , and the experimental and theoretical results related to the intermittency of turbulent velocity fields ( see frisch 1995 for references ) are the cornerstones of the present understanding of incompressible turbulence .",
    "much less is known about compressible ( supersonic ) turbulence .",
    "analytical approaches and laboratory experiments are still limited to low mach numbers , m@xmath3 , and the results of numerical simulations may depend crucially on the adopted boundary and initial conditions .",
    "von weizscker ( 1951 ) was the first to point out that the interstellar medium ( ism ) is characterized by very high reynolds numbers and high mach numbers , and thus highly supersonic turbulence should be its typical state .",
    "much work using the ism to study supersonic turbulence has since been attempted ( see , for example , dickman 1985 ; scalo 1987 ; falgarone & phillips 1990 ; elmegreen 1993 ; franco & carraminana 1999 ) . however , at the relatively large scales considered so far , @xmath4 cm , the ism may not be an adequate laboratory for studying supersonic turbulence in the traditional sense of the term `` turbulence . ''",
    "the initially hypothesized turbulent energy cascade from the largest to the smallest scales of the ism , initiated by the differential rotation of the galaxy ( von weizscker 1951 ; fleck 1981 ) is an obvious idealization . even if the differential rotation works as the major energy source for the observed turbulence in the neutral gas at the perifery of galaxies ( sellwood , & balbus 1999 ) , it should be disrupted by the powerfull injection of energy from supernovae and stellar winds at intermediate scales in the major galactic disk ( spitzer 1978 ) .",
    "ism turbulence at large and intermediate scales is also complicated by the effects of self - gravitation .",
    "it has recently been recognized that the 1.35-cm wavelength h@xmath0o  masers [ see reviews on masers in elitzur ( 1992 ) ; clegg and nedoluha ( 1993 ) ; migenes and reid ( 2002 ) ] may be promising tools for the study of `` kolmogorov - type '' supersonic turbulence .",
    "vlbi studies of the proper motions of several bright h@xmath0o  maser sources associated with newly - born stars have revealed expansion of the clusters of maser spots  participation in gas outflows from these stars ( see anderson and genzel 1993 for a review ) .",
    "this type of regular motion had been theoretically predicted before its discovery ( strelnitski & sunyaev 1973 ) . in some cases , including w49n , there are also indications of another regular component in the velocity field revealed by the masers  rotation ( reid _ etal .",
    "_  1988 , gwinn _ etal . _  1992 ) .",
    "however , besides these regular components , vlbi measurements indicated the presence of a residual _ random _ component of motion .",
    "typically , approximating the proper motion vectors by a simple model of expanding and rotating gas leaves a residual dispersion of @xmath5kms@xmath6  per axis , which is considerably larger than the errors of these observations ( reid _ etal .",
    "_  1988 ) .",
    "this value corresponds to @xmath7kms@xmath6  for the total velocity vector and can be considered the characteristic turbulent velocity dispersion at the largest spatial scale covered by the maser cluster .    walker ( 1984 ) , using the vlbi maps of the h@xmath0o  source in w49n obtained by walker , matsakis & garcia - barreto ( 1982 ) , demonstrated that both the two - point velocity increments and the two - point spatial correlation function show power - law dependencies on maser spot separation .",
    "this behavior is typical of a turbulent flow , although walker did not favor the turbulence interpretation .",
    "gwinn ( 1994 ) carried out a similar statistical analysis using better vlbi results for w49n obtained by gwinn _ etal . _  ( 1992 ) .",
    "he confirmed the power - law dependency of velocity dispersion and spatial density of masing spots on spatial scale and ascribed this behavior to turbulence .",
    "this paper summarizes a series of our studies of h@xmath0o  masers as tracers of supersonic turbulence in regions of star formation .",
    "preliminary results were reported by strelnintski _ etal . _  ( 1998 ) ,",

    "section  2 presents our vlbi results for the h@xmath0o  maser source in sgr b2(m ) .",
    "the geometrical properties of supersonic turbulence revealed by h@xmath0o  masers in this and four other sources are presented in section  3 , and the statistical properties of the velocity field traced by the masers in section  4 . in section  5 , proceeding from the hypothesis that the h@xmath0o  masers adequately probe the velocity field of turbulence , we discuss implications of our statistical results for the theory of supersonic turbulence . in section  6",
    "we describe a new conceptual model of h@xmath0o  masers in regions of star formation based on the surmised connection of maser pumping with the sites of ultimate dissipation of turbulent energy .",
    "conclusions are summarized in section  7 .",
    "the observations of sgr b2(m ) were conducted in 1986 on 23 january , 26 february , 27 march , and 26 april , as part of a campaign to measure proper motions of these h@xmath0o masers .",
    "four telescopes spanning the u.s . were used : the haystack 37-m telescope in westford , ma , the nrao 43-m telescope in green bank , wv , one 25-m telescope of the vla near socorro , nm , and the ovro 40-m telescope in big pine , ca . the mk iii recording system was used with four 2-mhz bands covering the lsr velocity ranges of -40 to -14 , + 18 to + 43 , + 43 to + 69 , and + 68 to + 94 km  s@xmath6 , assuming a rest frequency of 22235.08 mhz for the h@xmath0o @xmath8 transition .",
    "the recorded data were correlated at the mk iii processor at haystack observatory in a mode which yielded 56 ( uniformly weighted ) spectral channels , each 35.71 khz or 0.48 km  s@xmath6 wide .",
    "the data were edited , calibrated , and imaged following the same general procedures as described in reid _ etal . _  ( 1988 ) for the source sgr b2(n ) .",
    "the synthesized interferometer beam was approximately 2.4 by 0.4 mas fwhm , elongated in the north - south direction , owing to the low declination of sgr b2 .",
    "compact maser spots with flux densities ranging between 135 and 0.4 jy were detected across a field of approximately 2 by 2 arcseconds .",
    "the positions of the maser spots were obtained by fitting a circular gaussian brightness model for each spectral channel independently using the aips task imfit .",
    "figure  1 shows a series of decreasing spatial scales for our vlbi map of sgr b2(m ) .",
    "the scale changes by almost four orders of magnitude  from @xmath9arcsec down to @xmath10mas  which , at the assumed distance of 8  kpc ( reid 1993 ) , corresponds to a range of linear scales between , roughly , 10,000 and 1  a.u . as is typical of fractal dust - like structures , the distribution of masers looks qualitatively the same on all scales , with evident clustering .    on all maps of figure  1 , except the last one , dot sizes are larger than the typical observed size of an individual maser spot .",
    "dots on the last map show measured positions of spectral channels . since a spectral channel ( @xmath11kms@xmath6 ) is narrower than a typical spectral width of a single spot ( @xmath12kms@xmath6 ) , a dot on the last map typically represents the position and velocity of only a part of an individual spot .",
    "we call the smallest groupings of heavily blended individual spots `` minimal clusters . ''",
    "the dots on the map only approximate the extension of and the velocity dispersion in these minimal clusters .",
    "inspection of the available data indicates that a typical size of a minimal cluster is a few a.u .",
    "the velocity dispersion within minimal clusters varies from @xmath13 to 5 kms@xmath6 .",
    "we used two methods to estimate the fractal dimension of the spatial distribution of h@xmath0o  masers in sgrb2(m ) : the `` density - radius '' and the `` box - counting '' methods ( see e.g. crownover 1995 ; feder 1988 ) .",
    "the density - radius measure is based on the generalization of the mass _ versus _ radius relation for objects of integer dimension , @xmath14 where @xmath1 is the dimension of the object .",
    "equation  ( 1 ) can be used as a general definition of the dimension of an object , including objects whose average density changes in a self - similar way with changing scale ( e.g. mandelbrot 1982 ) . for these objects ( fractals )",
    "@xmath1 is non - integer .",
    "average density , @xmath15 , within a given volume @xmath16 is @xmath17 .",
    "therefore , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the dimension of the supporting space , e.g. @xmath20 for a plane .",
    "if the dimension of the object equals the dimension of the support , @xmath15 equals a constant . if not",
    ", @xmath15 is a function of @xmath21 .",
    "the steepness of this function depends on @xmath1 .    a more practical procedure results from differentiating equation  ( 1 ) , which gives @xmath22 or @xmath23 determining the dimension",
    "is thus reduced to measuring the slope of @xmath24 _ versus _ log@xmath25 . in the case of a point set like ours ,",
    "`` density '' means `` number density . ''    in our numerical procedure , @xmath26 is calculated ( for a discrete set of @xmath21 values ) as the surface density of companions to a given maser hot spot at angular separation @xmath21 , averaged over all maser spots : @xmath27}}\\;.\\ ] ] the same procedure was used by walker ( 1984 ) and gwinn ( 1994 ) for demonstrating self - similar clustering of h@xmath0o  masers in w49n .",
    "however , these authors did not relate @xmath28 to the fractal dimension of the source .",
    "larson ( 1995 ) uses a similar procedure to obtain a fractal dimension for a young stellar association in taurus .",
    "we tested our numerical procedure by obtaining the density - radius fractal measure of a simple straight line and of the classical mathematical fractal , a sierpinski triangle .",
    "the measured dimensions of 1.00 and 1.58 were in excellent agreement with their theoretical values @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "the box - counting measure associates a fractal object s dimension @xmath1 with the number @xmath31 of boxes of side length @xmath32 needed to cover the object ( crownover 1995 ) : @xmath33 the graph of log@xmath34 _ versus _",
    "log@xmath35 is a straight line , having slope @xmath36 .",
    "we used the following computational algorithm .",
    "the square plane of minimal side length @xmath37 containing the whole object is divided into @xmath38 equal squares of side length @xmath39 . the number of these squares containing one or more points making up the object is determined and stored .",
    "each non - empty square of side length @xmath39 is subdivided again into 4 squares of equal area ; the number of non - empty squares of side length @xmath40 is determined and stored , etc .",
    "the procedure is repeated down to some minimal side length of sub - squares ; minimal side length is determined by the characteristic length of the smallest features of the object .",
    "logarithm of the number of non - empty squares _ versus _ logarithm of their side length is plotted , and the slope of the straight line fitting the data points is measured ; this slope is equal to @xmath36 .",
    "this numerical procedure was also tested with a straight line and a sierpinski triangle .",
    "the measured values of dimension were again in agreement with the theoretical values .",
    "we used equation  ( 4 ) to determine the fractal dimension of the 2d projected ( @xmath20 ) h@xmath0o  masers in the four observations of sgrb2(m ) .",
    "the values of the fractal dimension for the four observations and for their average are indicated in the corresponding panels of figure  2 .",
    "the average value is @xmath41 .",
    "the box - counting result for the average of the four observations is shown in figure  3 .",
    "the ensuing fractal dimension , @xmath42 , is noticeably lower than that obtained from the density - radius plot .    for both measures ,",
    "a single linear fit is a satisfactory first approximation ; the standard deviation of the residuals to the fit does not surpass @xmath43 for each epoch of observations and for the combined fit .",
    "however , notable deviations from a single power - law approximation can be seen in figures  2 and 3 .",
    "for example , a higher fractal dimension for the largest scales is evidenced by the steeping slope of the points in figure  3 .",
    "some deviation from the linear dependence is seen in figure  2 , between log ( separation ) @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "it may indicate some depression of clustering at the scales around 0.003 arcsec ( @xmath46 cm for this source ) .",
    "the origin of the systematic difference between the two applied fractal measures is unclear .",
    "it may be rooted in technical particularities of the methods .",
    "some practical problems in the application of the box - counting method are discussed in gouyet ( 1996 , section 1.4.4 ) .",
    "this discussion indicates that derived fractal dimensions should be correct within a factor of two .",
    "given this uncertainty and the range of the derived values of slopes in figures  2 and 3 , we estimate the fractal dimension of the observed cluster as @xmath47 .    gwinn ( 1994 ) performed a statistical analysis of the vlbi maps of w49/h@xmath0o  obtained by gwinn _ etal . _  ( 1992 ) .",
    "he demonstrated a power - law dependence of the number density of neighbors on their separation .",
    "however , he used the one - dimensional projection of the distance and did not interpret his results in terms of fractals . to make results for w49n comparable to those for sgrb2(m )",
    ", we applied the density - radius fractal measure to the two - dimensional spatial distribution of the h@xmath0o  maser spots in w49n , using the vlbi positions published by gwinn _ etal . _  ( 1992 ) .",
    "we have applied this measure to three more sources  two with the published vlbi results : w51(main ) and w51n ( genzel et al .",
    "1981 ; schneps et al . 1981 ) and one source , w3(oh ) , for which we used our unpublished vlbi coordinates of the maser spots (",
    "the corresponding map of the source was published  alcolea et al .",
    "1992 ) .",
    "the results for all sources are shown in figure  4 .",
    "a power - law dependence is a good approximation for all of them and it gives a low fractal dimension , @xmath48 , for all the observed sets of maser spots as projected on the sky .",
    "given the small angular dimensions of maser clusters ( @xmath49arcsec ) , their projection on the sky is essentially an orthogonal projection .",
    "therefore , the dimension @xmath50 of the real fractal , residing in 3-space , coincides with the dimension , @xmath51 , of its 2d projection if @xmath52 ( e.g. falconer 1990 ) .",
    "we have demonstrated above that this condition is fulfilled for h@xmath0o  masers .",
    "thus , we conclude that the fractal dimension of h@xmath0o  clusters in all five of the sources we have studied is low , @xmath53 .",
    "this conclusion is new , although walker ( 1984 ) and gwinn ( 1994 ) obtained results that can be converted to estimates of fractal dimension .",
    "walker ( 1984 ) obtained a high negative value of the power index ( @xmath54 ) in the power - law approximation of the density - radius dependence for w49n / h@xmath0o .",
    "this corresponds to a fractal dimension @xmath55 .",
    "gwinn ( 1994 ) reduced his two - point correlation analysis of h@xmath0o  masers in w49n to the 1d projection of the observed map on the @xmath56 axis .",
    "he obtained a power index , @xmath57 , for a large interval of scales .",
    "although he did not connect this result with a fractal dimension , we note that for a 1d - projected fractal , @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the fractal dimension of the 1d projection of the real fractal residing in 3-space .",
    "thus , gwinn s result corresponds to @xmath60 . since @xmath61",
    ", the same fractal dimension is ascribed to both the 2d - projection and the real fractal residing in 3-space .",
    "thus , both the walker s ( 1984 ) and the gwinn s ( 1994 ) results support our conclusion that the fractal dimension of h@xmath0o  clusters is @xmath48 .    to better appreciate the fractal distribution of h@xmath0o  masers , it is instructive to compare it with models of homogeneously distributed random points .",
    "in our numerical model we created 90 points randomly and uniformly distributed in a thin spherical shell and then projected this distribution onto a plane .",
    "a drastic difference between the model distribution and the observed maser distribution can be seen visually ( a lack of clustering in the model distribution ) and is confirmed by the measured spatial dimension of the model point sets . as anticipated , both box - counting and density - radius methods gave @xmath62 for the random , homogeneous cluster of model dots , to be compared with @xmath63 for the observed clusters of maser spots .",
    "other types of masers should also be tested for possible fractal structure .",
    "at least some of them do not seem to have such structure .",
    "for example , the oh masers associated with regions of star formation do not show self - similar spatial distribution , rather they demonstrate strong clustering on one scale , @xmath64 cm ( reid _ etal . _  1980 ) .",
    "these masers form just outside an expanding ultra compact hii region and would not be expected to have a turbulent structure of the same kind as the h@xmath0o  masers that are due to the shear between a stellar wind and surrounding gas ( see section  6 ) .",
    "we investigated two statistical properties of the velocity field traced by h@xmath0o  masers in the same five sources : ( 1 ) the low - order two - point velocity structure functions , and ( 2 ) the probability distribution for the deviations of the two - point velocity increment from its mean value at different spatial scales .",
    "most statistical studies of the kinematics and structure of interstellar gas using masers as probes have so far been limited to one velocity component ( the line - of - sight ) and two coordinates on the celestial sphere . owing to the smallness of maser sources (",
    "a whole source is only @xmath65arcsec across ) , the two spherical celestial coordinates are , with high precision , approximated by rectangular cartesian coordinates .",
    "we assume , as all previous authors implicitly did , that if a power - law scaling relation takes place for velocity vectors in 3d space , the same relation , with the same exponent , holds for the dependence of the line - of - sight component of velocity on projected distances .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption if the velocity field is isotropic .",
    "it is analogous to the well - known use of the longitudinal velocity component in incompressible turbulence studies ( see e.g. frisch 1995 )",
    ".    statistical analysis of the velocity field probed by h@xmath0o  masers has previously been performed for w49n on two independent sets of data ( walker 1984 , gwinn 1994 ) .",
    "we discuss here only the low - velocity h@xmath0o  maser spots ( @xmath66kms@xmath6  from the systemic velocity ) , which are more likely connected with the `` kolmogorov - type '' supersonic turbulence than the high - velocity spots ( section  6 ) . walker ( 1984 ) did not see an explicit dependence of two - point velocity increments on point separation for low - velocity features , shown in his figure  8 .",
    "one can interpret this graph as a power law with the exponenent @xmath67 .",
    "gwinn ( 1994 ) found @xmath68 for the dependence of the median velocity differences on the 1d projection of the maser pair separation .",
    "one can conclude from these two studies that the value of @xmath69 for the two - point correlation function in w49n / h@xmath0o  does not surpass 1/3 .    for each of the five h@xmath0o  sources ( section  3 ) we calculated the structure functions @xmath70 for low values of the order of the function , @xmath71 . in equation  ( 7 ) the vectors",
    "* r * and * l * determine the positions of the two points in the plane of the sky , @xmath72 designates the line - of - sight velocity and @xmath32 the 2d projection of the linear distance between the points .",
    "our calculation procedure is as follows .",
    "the whole range of maser spot angular separations ( up to four orders of magnitude , in both sources ) is divided into @xmath31 bins , with logarithmically increasing bin size and thus logarithmically increasing separation between bin - centers . using the vlbi relative position data",
    ", the procedure selects all pairs within a given separation bin and calculates one of the functions ( eq.[7 ] ) .",
    "this procedure is repeated for every separation bin and the resultant averages of the powers of velocity differences are plotted as a function of separation in a log - log graph",
    ". a least - squares fit of a straight line to the points on the graph is then performed to obtain a power - law exponent , @xmath69 , and its uncertainty ( one standard deviation ) .",
    "figure  5 gives the results for sgr  b2(m ) , for @xmath73 .",
    "the figure shows the results for the four epochs of observations ( section  2 ) , as well as their average .",
    "the data are satisfactorily approximated by a power law .",
    "we obtain @xmath74 , when the whole set of data is used .",
    "when data for the largest scales ( log @xmath75 ) are excluded ( to avoid possible edge effects ) , the value of @xmath69 changes insignificantly : @xmath76 .",
    "the second and third order structure functions have the exponents of @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively .",
    "we note that for all three structure functions the power - law exponents are close to their classic kolmogorov values , which are 1/3 , 2/3 and 1.0 for @xmath792 and 3 , respectively .",
    "the results for @xmath73 for other sources are presented in figure  6 .",
    "the power - law approximation gives the values of @xmath69 close to 1/3 for all the sources except for w3(oh ) , where it is significantly lower ( @xmath80 ) . in this source",
    ", however , the vlbi map reveals a strong regular component of motion ( strongly collimated bipolar outflow ) , which should significantly influence the results when the whole vlbi map is considered for the statistical analysis . to decrease the influence of the regular velocity component",
    ", we obtained the first order structure function for only one of the two lobes of the bipolar outflow . in this case , the regular component of the relative velocities should be minimal , and one can anticipate that the bulk of the relative motions of the condensations will be due to turbulence . the result is shown in figure  7 ; the value of @xmath69 ( 0.30 ) is now much closer to the kolmogorov value .    with all sources displaying the low - order structure functions close to kolmogorov s",
    ", one might wonder how likely it is that this is simply coincidental .",
    "can regular , non turbulent velocity fields , such as expansion and/or rotation , produce the observed power - law dependence of the velocity increments on spatial scales , with the power index close to 1/3 ?    in order to answer this question",
    "we applied the same statistical analysis to the results of numerical modeling that simulated regular motions of the maser spots only .",
    "90 model dots were randomly and uniformly distributed in a thin spherical shell .",
    "three types of regular motion were considered : ( 1 ) radial expansion ; ( 2 ) rotation around an axis perpendicular to the line of sight ; and ( 3 ) expansion plus rotation . in the last case we varied the ratio of the absolute values of the expansion velocity and the velocity of rotation on the equator .",
    "the results of the ( line - of - sight velocity ) @xmath81 ( dot separation ) correlation analysis are shown in figure  8 .",
    "the long straight line on the plots shows the slope 1/3 for reference .",
    "the quickly growing dispersion of the data points at smaller scales , seen on all the plots , is due to the uniform , non - fractal distribution of the points  a lack of clustering , and thus a poor statistics , at smaller scales .",
    "this large dispersion makes a linear fit beyond about 1.5 orders of magnitude from the largest scale meaningless .",
    "the slope of the fitting line , drawn in this limited interval , changes from about zero for the case of pure expansion ( @xmath82 , for the specific realization shown in figure  8) to approximately unity for the case of pure rotation ( @xmath83 in the example shown ) .",
    "all intermediate values of the slope can be achieved by combining expansion and rotation in a due proportion ( the four lower panels ) . in particular , the `` kolmogorov '' value",
    "1/3 is achieved when the ratio of the velocity of rotation on the equator to the velocity of expansion is @xmath84 .",
    "it is quite improbable , however , that this _ ad hoc _ combination of kinematic parameters , plus the same orientation of the axis of rotation is realized in all the sources under study . in all the published models of the observed proper motions and radial velocities of h@xmath0o  masers",
    "the deduced model ratio of the expansion - to - rotation velocities is less than one . in w49n",
    "these velocities are almost equal  17 and 16 kms@xmath6 , respectively ( we consider here only the low - velocity componenent of expansion ; see section  6 ) .",
    "it is seen from figure  8 that such a low ratio of expansion - to - rotation should produce a flatter slope than 1/3 at large scales .",
    "it is noteworthy that flattening of the slope of the two - point correlation function does indeed appear at larger scales for all the sources in figure  6 .",
    "this reveals the contamination of the statistical properties of the turbulent component of motion by the regular component .",
    "the role of the regular component(s ) of the velocity field relative to the turbulent component drops with the decreasing spatial scale , and it is remarkable how effectively the smaller scales `` compensate '' for the flattening at the larger scales in figure  6 and force the average slope to tend to its kolmogorov value .",
    "an inherent manifestation of terrestrial turbulent flows is _ intermittency _  the spatial and temporal inhomogeneity of the velocity field .",
    "intermittency results in enhanced , higher than gaussian , probability of large deviations of the two - point velocity increments from their average value at a given spatial scale .",
    "deviations from a gaussian distribution have been observed in laboratory and atmospheric incompressible turbulent flows [ dutton and deaven ( 1969 ) , van atta and park ( 1972 ) ] .",
    "falgarone and phillips ( 1990 ) and falgarone , phillips , and walker ( 1991 ) attributed the broad ( broader than gaussian ) wings of the emission line profiles observed in molecular clouds to an excess of large deviations from the average velocity difference in the cloud .",
    "masers are more direct probes of the velocity field than thermal molecular lines observed in the cold clouds ( see section  6 ) .",
    "typically , the available vlbi results provide coordinates and line - of - sight velocities for @xmath85 maser spots per observation .",
    "thus , there are @xmath86 unique pairings for measuring the velocity - difference distribution . given this relatively large number",
    ", we hoped that the statistics were sufficient to identify possible deviations from a gaussian distribution at various spatial scales .",
    "figures  9 and 10 show examples of velocity - difference probability distributions obtained for particular spatial ranges in sgrb2(m ) .",
    "the range for a given spatial scale was chosen to be equal to the scale .",
    "unfortunately , some individual distributions were found to be not well - defined , centrally peaked distributions , which is evidently due to insufficient statistics .    in order to produce a more statistically significant result",
    ", we attempted to co - add the individual distributions .",
    "the summation was done as follows .",
    "the velocity difference ( @xmath56 axis ) and the number of pairs or counts ( @xmath87 axis ) of the individual distributions were independently normalized .",
    "the @xmath87 axis was normalized by dividing all bin counts by the maximum bin count . in order to normalize the @xmath56 axis ,",
    "we first considered how the absolute value of the maximum velocity difference of individual distributions scaled as a function of radial separation between maser pairs .",
    "we found that this function was well approximated by a power - law .",
    "the best fitting straight line gave the exponent @xmath88 .",
    "given the previously established kolmogorov scaling law for the mean absolute velocity differences between maser points , this result could be anticipated if we assume that the dispersion of velocity differences at a given scale is proportional to the mean absolute velocity difference at that scale . using the resulting linear fit",
    ", the dispersions of velocity differences for individual distributions were normalized by multiplying the @xmath56-values of a distribution by the ratio @xmath89 where @xmath90 is arbitrarily chosen to equal the maximum observed absolute value of the velocity difference occurring in the central spatial bin , and @xmath91 is the maximum absolute velocity difference value of an individual distribution .",
    "once the @xmath56 and @xmath87 axes of the individual distributions were normalized , these distributions were co - added , producing a single histogram of the distribution averaged over spatial scales .",
    "the conjoined histogram for sgrb2(m ) is shown in figure  10 .",
    "it has a well - defined , centrally - symmetric shape .",
    "however , fitting it with a single gaussian results in strong positive residuals in the wings of the distribution ( figure  10@xmath92 ) .",
    "a two - gaussian fit , both gaussians being centered at zero , results in much smaller residuals ( figure  10@xmath93 ) . due to the method by which this histogram has been obtained , it contains only averaged ( over all the spatial scales ) information about the probabilities of deviations . comparing the conjoined histogram with the individual histograms shows that summation significantly improves the statistics .",
    "this is indirect evidence that the velocity field at all or at most of the accessible spatial scales , has qualitatively similar statistical properties , including an excess of large deviations from gaussian distribution .",
    "the two - gaussian fit of the conjoined distribution provides a quantitative measure of the excesses , averaged over the entire scale range .",
    "the narrower gaussian approximately describes the central part of the distribution , and the broader one describes its wings .",
    "the ratio `` narrow / broad '' of areas under these two gaussians measures the excess of large deviations .",
    "> from figure  9@xmath93 , this ratio is @xmath94 , considerably less than unity .",
    "thus , the super - gaussian wings are significant indeed .",
    "figure  11 shows the results of the same analysis for four other h@xmath0o  sources . in all of them , the wings of the distribution are much broader than those of the gaussian that fits the central part of the distribution .",
    "this demonstrates that excess of large velocity - difference deviations is a common feature of the turbulent velocity fields probed by h@xmath0o  masers .",
    "in this section we discuss possible implications of our results for the theory of supersonic turbulence .",
    "the statistical study of h@xmath0o  masers described in the previous sections reveals three important results : ( 1 ) self - similarity ( fractality ) of the spatial distribution of the maser spots , ( 2 ) power - law character of the structure functions for the velocity field traced by the masers , with the power indices close to their classic kolmogorov values for incompressible turbulence , and ( 3 ) excess of large fluctuations of the two - point velocity increments .",
    "as all these features are typical of the relatively well studied , incompressible turbulence , one can suspect that h@xmath0o  masers in regions of star formation arise in a turbulent medium .",
    "if this assumption is correct , h@xmath0o  masers , due to their record brightness and small angular sizes , may become unique probes of astrophysical turbulence .",
    "since the velocity increments at the largest scales in the h@xmath0o  clusters are much greater than the probable speed of sound in neutral molecular gas , we deal here , by definition , with the poorly studied supersonic regime of turbulence .",
    "comparison with the available theoretical knowledge about incompressible turbulence should therefore be done with high caution .",
    "the major conclusion of our analysis in section  3 is that the spatial distribution of h@xmath0o  masers is fractal and that the measured fractal dimension is low , @xmath63 .",
    "if h@xmath0o  masers trace the dissipation of supersonic turbulence , we should conclude that the fractal dimension of supersonic turbulence is considerably lower than that of incompressible turbulence , the latter being @xmath95 ( mandelbrot 1982 ) . if one accepts the hypothesis that mass fluctuations in star forming clouds are produced by supersonic turbulence ( larson 1995 ) , then the low fractal dimension ( @xmath96 ) of a cluster of young stars in taurus measured by larson can be considered as a corroboration of our conclusion .",
    "another relevant fact may be the observed low fractal dimension of the large - scale distribution of galaxies ( @xmath97 ; mandelbrot 1982 ) , but the role of turbulence in shaping this structure is even less clear .",
    "it is helpful to introduce the `` running '' filling factor , @xmath98 , of `` daughter '' turbulence elements within `` mother '' elements ( frisch 1995 ) .",
    "the dimension of a fractal is expressed through @xmath98 by @xmath99 where @xmath19 is the dimension of the supporting space and @xmath100 is the scaling factor from the mother eddies to the daughter eddies .",
    "constancy of @xmath98 from scale to scale guarantees a well - determined value of @xmath1 ( a linear plot in figurs  2  4 ) . from equation  ( 9 )",
    "@xmath101 which shows that the filling factor of active daughter eddies in mother eddies decreases when the fractal dimension of turbulence decreases .",
    "the filling factor of active eddies is a direct measure of the degree of intermittency ( spottiness ) of turbulence .",
    "we conclude that highly supersonic turbulence , as revealed by h@xmath0o  masers and perhaps by the large - scale galaxy distribution and the distribution of stars in young clusters , is more intermittent than incompressible turbulence .",
    "the very possibility of representing the observed spatial distribution of active turbulence elements by a single power law means that turbulence is intermittent on virtually all scales .",
    "the all - scale intermittency is also corroborated by the fact that the strong excess of the large velocity - difference deviations is revealed by the statistics averaged over different spatial scales ( section  4.2 ) .",
    "this seems to be an important conclusion , because , in the case of incompressible turbulence , with its relatively high fractal dimension , the existence of intermittency in the inertial subrange of the scales ( as opposed to the dissipation subrange ) has long been an open question ( frisch 1995 ) .",
    "according to the classical work by kolmogorov ( 1941b , c , 1942 ) , incompressible turbulence is characterized by two limiting scales  the outer scale @xmath37 , where energy is supplied to the turbulent flow , and the inner scale @xmath102 , where it is dissipated via molecular viscosity .",
    "the `` inertial '' subrange of linear scales @xmath32 , where kinetic energy is neither injected into turbulence nor dissipated , but only transferred from larger to smaller scales , is between : @xmath103 . in the inertial subrange",
    ", turbulence tends to become homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "kolmogorov demonstrated that the inner scale of incompressible turbulence is of the order of @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid and @xmath106 is the mean rate of energy dissipation per unit mass , given by the equation : @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the characteristic velocity difference at the outer scale @xmath37 .",
    "expression ( 11 ) for the dissipation scale is readily obtained from dimensional considerations ; it is the only combination with the dimensions of length that can be constructed from the two parameters relevant to this mechanism of energy dissipation , @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "our attempt to derive a possible inner scale for highly supersonic turbulence is based on two assumptions .",
    "first , proceeding from the common belief that the major mechanism of energy dissipation in supersonic turbulence is via shock waves , we assume that sonic speed , @xmath109 , rather than molecular viscosity , is the relevant parameter of the problem .",
    "our second assumption may be more arguable .",
    "we assume that the second relevant parameter of the problem is the same as for incompressible turbulence  the mean rate of energy dissipation , @xmath110 .",
    "thus , we assume that @xmath110 is an approximate constant of the energy cascade , equal to the rate , per unit mass , of supply of kinetic energy at the outer scale .",
    "in other words , we assume no significant energy dissipation at intermediate scales . although some theoretical and observational arguments can be provided in favor of this hypothesis ( see below ) , we emphasize that , for the moment , it is only a hypothesis , whose consequences we would like to compare with observations .    with these two assumptions",
    ", we can derive the dissipation scale for supersonic turbulence , @xmath111 using standard dimensional analysis .",
    "it is easy to show that only one combination can be formed by @xmath109 and @xmath110 with the dimensions of length , namely : @xmath112 substituting @xmath113 from equation  ( 12 ) into equation  ( 13 ) , we can give @xmath111 a more useful form : @xmath114 where m@xmath115 is the typical value of the mach number associated with the outer scale .",
    "equation ( 14 ) shows that in highly supersonic turbulence ( m@xmath116 ) , the scale where shock waves begin to dissipate turbulent energy effectively is many orders of magnitude smaller than the outer scale @xmath37 .",
    "an argument in favor of our assumption that highly supersonic turbulence does not dissipate much of its kinetic energy at larger scales is the observed kolmogorov , 1/3 , slope of the two - point velocity correlation function in h@xmath0o  masers .",
    "the 1/3 slope is a straightforward consequence of the conservation of energy during its cascade along the hierarchy of scales .",
    "any energy dissipation in the inertial subrange would produce a steeper slope .",
    "the specific kinetic energy associated with turbulent pulsations on a linear scale @xmath32 is @xmath117 , where @xmath118 is the r.m.s .",
    "turbulent velocity on the scale @xmath32 .",
    "this energy is passed to smaller scales in about one `` turn - over '' time , @xmath119 therefore , the rate of energy transfer is @xmath120 if @xmath110 is constant , equation ( 16 ) gives @xmath121 .",
    "suppose now that some amount of energy is dissipated on each scale .",
    "then @xmath110 is not a constant  it decreases with decreasing @xmath32 . approximating this decrease by a power law ,",
    "@xmath122 we have @xmath123 which demonstrates the steeping of the scaling law ( since @xmath124 ) .",
    "why can energy dissipation in larger - scale shocks be hindered in highly supersonic turbulence ?",
    "here is one possible answer .",
    "although the potential component of the velocity field ( describing compression and expansion of the gas ) should play some part in a supersonic flow , this part may crucially depend on the unknown boundary and initial conditions of the flow ( e.g. falgarone _ etal . _  1994 ) .",
    "an extreme case is a purely vortical initial motion of gas at the larger scales . in this case , although the velocity increments for these scales ( the difference in velocities of two opposite peripheral points of an `` eddy '' ) may be highly supersonic , most converging flows within the eddy , which arise from fluctuations , will produce _ oblique _ shocks , whose normal velocity component , @xmath125 , will not exceed @xmath109 by much , and thus it will be small in comparison with the average vortical velocity increment : @xmath126 .",
    "thus , even if a shock of large scale is formed , the time it needs to sweep the eddy and dissipate its kinetic energy is much longer than the turn - over time ( given in equation  15 ) , during which the eddy will disintegrate , passing its energy to smaller scales . only when @xmath118 drops down to @xmath127 , which happens at the inner scale , @xmath128 and @xmath118 become comparable , and massive dissipation of kinetic energy in random shocks becomes possible .",
    "this gives a possible physical justification to equation ( 14 ) .",
    "the important conclusion from the results presented in section  4.1 is that the exponents of the low - order structure functions for the highly supersonic turbulence are close to their classic kolmogorov values . in particular , the exponents of the second order structure function in all the investigated sources are close to 2/3 .",
    "this value was predicted by kolmogorov for homogeneous incompressible turbulence at very high reynolds numbers ( kolmogorov 1941 a - c ) .",
    "later , many authors , beginning with kolmogorov himself ( kolmogorov 1962 ) , attempted to introduce theoretical corrections to this exponent which would account for the experimentally detected intermittency of turbulence ( e.g. mandelbrot 1967 ; frisch , sulem & nelkin 1978 ; see also frisch 1995 ) .",
    "for example , in the popular `` @xmath98-model '' of frisch , sulem , and nelkin , intermittency is assumed to have a fractal geometry , and the corrected exponent is given by @xmath129 where @xmath1 is the fractal dimension of the set on which intermittent turbulence concentrates . in the case of incompressible turbulence @xmath130 and , therefore , the codimension @xmath131 and the whole correction factor [ second term in equation ( 19 ) ] are small .",
    "in fact , most of these intermittency corrections have historically been introduced as _",
    "small _ parameters , to account for the small degree of observed intermittency in incompressible flow .",
    "this has made it difficult to discriminate between different theoretical models , as well as to judge , in general , the plausibility of the approach treating intermittency as a `` disturbance '' to the classic kolmogorov theory .",
    "highly supersonic turbulent flow should have specific features different from those of incompressible turbulence .",
    "these two regimes of turbulence should , at least , differ in the ways they ultimately dissipate energy  via shock waves and molecular viscosity , respectively . however , the power - law character of the observed spectrum of supersonic turbulence , over several decades in scale , is a strong indication that the energy cascade from larger to smaller scales is as intrinsic a property of supersonic turbulence as it is for incompressible turbulence .",
    "moreover , the prominent fractal structure of the set on which supersonic turbulence dissipates its energy and the non - gaussian statistics of the two - point velocity increments , as revealed by h@xmath0o  masers , are strong evidence for qualitative similarity of both regimes of turbulence also in the sense of an intermittent character of turbulent activity .",
    "since the energy cascade and intermittency are the only two assumptions in the above mentioned models of incompressible turbulence , these models should likely also work in the case of supersonic turbulence .",
    "the only application of incompressibility of turbulence in these models is the assumption that energy is not dissipated at the intermediate ( inertial subrange ) scales .",
    "this assumption is not obvious for compressible , supersonic turbulence .",
    "however , the observed slope of the two - point velocity correlation function , close to kolmogorov s , suggests that dissipation on intermediate scales is insignificant in the supersonic case too ( section  5.1 ) .",
    "it is important to note , in this connection , that the h@xmath0o  masers reveal a very low fractal dimension ( @xmath63 ) of the set on which supersonic turbulence ultimately dissipates in shock waves .",
    "with such a low @xmath1 , the correction term from the beta - model [ equation  ( 19 ) ] is large , and we anticipate that , due to intermittency , the slope of the second order structure function will be at least twice as steep as kolmogorov s classic value .",
    "any dissipation of energy on intermediate scales  the only possible difference from the incompressible case  would steepen the structure function even more .",
    "yet , the observed structure functions are close to kolmogorov s .",
    "the observed pronounced intermittency of turbulence combined with the classic kolmogorov velocity structure functions can only be understood if we accept that intermittency is inherent in turbulence  not a mere disturbance of its classic kolmogorov properties .",
    "such an approach to incompressible turbulence is being developed by barenblatt and chorin ( 1997 ; hereafter b&c ) ) .",
    "these authors claim , in particular , that both the tendency of the second order structure function to its classic dependence on @xmath32 and an increase of the degree of intermittency are natural asymptotic properties of turbulence when the reynolds number tends to infinity .",
    "as first pointed out by von weizscker ( 1951 ) , the reynolds numbers of the interstellar gas are , in general , very high .",
    "the reynolds numbers of the dense nuclei of the star - forming molecular clouds , where h@xmath0o  masers reside , are especially high , due to the low viscosity of the dense gas .",
    "the turbulent flows probed by h@xmath0o  masers , have typical velocities @xmath132cm / s at a scale of @xmath133 cm . with the typical number density",
    "@xmath134@xmath135  and temperature @xmath136k for a molecular cloud core , the kinematic viscosity is @xmath137 , and the typical value of the reynolds number , @xmath138 , is @xmath139 .    for incompressible turbulence ,",
    "the reynolds number is a measure of the width of the inertial subrange .",
    "if the inertial subrange of supersonic turbulence probed by h@xmath0o  had been limited by viscosity , it would have been very large . however , there is little doubt that , in the highly supersonic regime , the dissipation of energy starts at a much larger scale than the inner scale determined by viscosity . in section  5.2",
    ", we postulated the existence in highly supersonic turbulence of an inner scale determined by energy dissipation in small - scale stochastic shocks and given by equation ( 14 ) .",
    "although this inner scale is much larger than the kolmogorov dissipation scale ( @xmath140 cm ; @xmath141 cm ) , there is still a large inertial subrange in the highly supersonic regime ",
    "almost four decades in projected linear scale .    one can try to reformulate the b&c theory and obtain an asymptotic law for the supersonic regime using the mach number rather than the reynolds number . as is customary in crude",
    "phenomenological approaches , we shall ignore distinctions between structure functions involving different components of the velocity vectors .",
    "specifically , we shall assume that the second order structure function @xmath142 involving the line - of - sight ( @xmath143 ) component of the difference velocity vector for two points reflects typical properties of all other structure functions .",
    "following the reasoning of b&c , we can assume that in the inertial subrange of supersonic turbulence @xmath144 where @xmath113 is the mean rate of energy dissipation per unit mass .",
    "it is assumed that in this inertial subrange the energy flux from larger to smaller scales is nearly constant and equal to @xmath113 . applying the standard dimensional analysis",
    ", we find the scaling law for @xmath142 : @xmath145 where @xmath146 is a dimensionless function of its two dimensionless arguments .",
    "we chose the mach number at the outer scale , m@xmath147 , and the running scale @xmath32 measured in the units of inner scale , @xmath111 , as the two dimensionless arguments .",
    "in the case of incompressible turbulence the reynolds number , instead of the mach number , enters the parentheses in equation  ( 20 ) .    the dimensional analysis , by itself ,",
    "does nt tell us anything about the properties of the function @xmath146 and its two arguments . in order to finalize the scaling law",
    ", one must make a _ similarity assumption _ about the behavior of @xmath146 as its two arguments tend to infinity . as b&c point out , two different assumptions about this function mark the historical evolution of incompressible turbulence theory :    \\1",
    ". complete similarity in both arguments : @xmath148const , when both dimensionless arguments tend to infinity ( kolmogorov 1941a ) ;    \\2 .",
    "complete similarity in re , but incomplete similarity in @xmath149 , leads to a power - law dependence of @xmath146 on @xmath149 ( kolmogorov 1962 ) .",
    "the first assumption leads to the classic kolmogorov @xmath150 .",
    "the second assumption introduces an additive correction to the power index , which has been interpreted as a correction for intermittency .",
    "b&c argue that the second assumption is internally contradictory and make the separate assumption of incomplete similarity in @xmath149 and _ no _ similarity in re .",
    "this again generates an additive correction to the power index , but now the correction depends on the value of re . in the limit of re@xmath151",
    "the correction tends to zero and one is left with the classic @xmath152 dependence .",
    "the correction is substantial only when re is not large .",
    "these similarity arguments can be repeated in the case of highly supersonic turbulence , with the formal substitution of m@xmath147 for re .",
    "the b&c s theory makes no quantitative estimates of the magnitude of re ( or m@xmath147 , in our case ) necessary to reach the asymptotic behavior of @xmath153 .",
    "we can suppose that in the case of turbulence probed by h@xmath0o  masers , m@xmath147 is high enough for the correction to kolmogorov value of the power index to lie within the experimental errors .",
    "thus , b&c s theory ( and its extension to supersonic turbulence ) rejects the notion that significant intermittency requires a significant correction to kolmogorov s 1941 law and thereby reconciles the observed low fractal dimension ( high intermittency ) of supersonic turbulence and its classic kolmogorov velocity structure functions .",
    "one can speculate that a jet from a young star produces two basic flow regimes in the ambient gas : ( 1 ) a frontal , high - mach shock and ( 2 ) a high - vorticity flow due to the velocity shear at the side interface of the jet and the ambient gas ( e.g. masson & chernin 1993 ) .",
    "we surmise that the low - velocity h@xmath0o  masers are associated with the second regime .",
    "the high - velocity h@xmath0o  masers may be connected with the first regime , but one can anticipate that this connection , and turbulence produced by the frontal shock , would be more complicated than in the second regime . looking for the simplest cases of supersonic turbulence ,",
    "we discuss only the second regime and the low - velocity masers in this investigation .",
    "a power - law spatial - distribution correlation function in all of the h@xmath0o  sources investigated here signifies self - similar clustering over almost four orders of magnitude in scale  from @xmath154a.u . to @xmath65a.u .",
    "the `` minimal clusters '' in this hierarchy [ `` features '' in gwinn s ( 1994 ) terminology ] , are actually spatial and spectral blends of elementary sources  those observed through an element of spectral resolution . by the order of magnitude , both the elementary sources and the minimal clusters have a typical size of @xmath65a.u . , which is intriguingly close to the predicted dissipation scale of supersonic turbulence , given by equation ( 14 ) . in a typical h@xmath0o  maser source , the low - velocity features are spread over a projected area of @xmath133 cm and occupy a velocity interval @xmath155km / s .",
    "taking @xmath156 km / s ( appropriate for probable kinetic temperatures of several hundred k ) , we have @xmath157 and @xmath158 cm @xmath159a.u . unless this is a coincidence , the smallest clusters of h@xmath0o  masers may be the sites of the ultimate dissipation of turbulent energy via stochastic shocks on the inner scale of supersonic turbulence .",
    "this new conceptual approach to h@xmath0o  masers may have several important consequences for understanding the very mechanism of masing in these sources .",
    "it has often been argued that shock waves provide the best conditions for pumping h@xmath0o  masers .",
    "strelnitski and sunyaev ( 1973 ) interpreted the observed large dispersion of the h@xmath0o  doppler velocities in w49n as due to supersonic gas outflow from a young host star and conjectured that the interaction of the outflow with the surrounding gas could produce shock waves necessary for pumping .",
    "this hypothesis has been further developed by many authors , who have elaborated on details of the shock structure and collisional - radiative ( the first word standing for the source and the second  for the sink of the quantum heat engine ) or collisional - collisional schemes of maser pumping behind a shock ( e.g. , shmeld , strelnitski & muzylev 1976 ; strelnitski 1984 ; kylafis & norman 1986 , 1987 ; hollenbach , mckee & chernoff 1987 ; elitzur , hollenbach & mckee 1989 ; kaufman & neufeld 1996 ) .",
    "a common feature of all these models is that the pumping shock is a result of a direct collision of the outflow with a dense blob in the surrounding quiescent gas , or a direct collision of a dense blob in the outflow with the surrounding gas ( tarter & welch ( 1986 ) . in the present model , the pumping energy",
    "is not imparted to the masing gas blobs directly by the stellar wind . instead",
    ", the energy is channeled to the masers by a cascade from larger scales , which receive energy from the stellar wind or jets .    in previous models ,",
    "the shocks pumping h@xmath0o  masers were assumed to have high velocities .",
    "these were either high - speed ( @xmath160kms@xmath6 ) dissociative j - shocks ( elitzur , hollenbach & mckee 1989 ) , or slower ( @xmath161kms@xmath6 ) c - shocks propagating perpendicular to the magnetic field ( kaufman & neufeld 1996 ) .",
    "two main goals were pursued in developing those models : ( 1 ) the achievement of the maximum possible abundance of h@xmath0o  molecules via chemical reactions , and ( 2 ) the realization of sufficiently high kinetic temperatures for pumping the @xmath162 and other masing transitions .",
    "it has been argued ( melnick _ etal . _  1993 ; kaufman & neufeld 1996 ) that to fulfill both these requirements , temperatures @xmath163k are needed .",
    "an important question is whether the slow shocks we advocate in this paper can provide such temperatures .",
    "an analysis of the shock structure is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "however , we note that a j - shock propagating _ along _ the magnetic field lines will have a post - shock temperature @xmath163k , if its velocity is @xmath164kms@xmath6 , which is a realistic velocity for an inner scale shock in our model .",
    "if the new conception of h@xmath0o  masers proposed here is correct , they may become an ideal tool for studying the properties of supersonic turbulence .",
    "in contrast to the large - scale ism , supersonic turbulence probed by h@xmath0o  masers has only one source of energy , supplied at the largest scale  the interaction of the outflow from a young star with the surrounding gas .",
    "furthermore , these flows are highly super - virial , so that gravitational effects are not important . most probably , these flows are also super - alfvenic . with the probable magnetic field strength @xmath165 g in the dense cores of molecular clouds , and @xmath166 g in the h@xmath0o  maser clumps ( fiebig & gsten 1989 ) , and with the probable number densities of molecular hydrogen , @xmath167 and @xmath168@xmath135 respectively , the alfvenic velocity is @xmath169kms@xmath6  in both cases .",
    "this is much less than the outer scale velocity ( @xmath170kms@xmath6 ) .",
    "thus , turbulent velocities at most of the scales should be greater than the alfvenic velocity , which means that the magnetic field does not constrain turbulent pulsations .",
    "masers are more effective than traditional ism probes of turbulence , such as thermal or fluorescent spectral lines , from the observational standpoint .",
    "maser lines are bright and narrow , which allows the spatial and kinematic structure of the associated flow to be measured with high precision . because masing condensations are so small ( @xmath10 marcsec )",
    ", every spectral feature detected by the interferometer gives a direct measure of line - of - sight velocity at a given _ point _ in the flow , projected onto the sky .",
    "indeed , the requirement of the velocity coherence along the line of sight ( to produce lines with the observed widths @xmath10kms@xmath6 ) , together with the observed line - of - sight velocity gradients in the transverse direction of @xmath49kms@xmath6au@xmath6 , and under the assumption that velocity gradients in the region are more or less isotropic , limits the probable length of a maser hot spot along the line of sight to @xmath171au .",
    "this is much less than the size of the whole active region ( @xmath172au ) and allows us to consider the h@xmath0o  masers as point - like probes of the velocity field , virtually as effective as the direct probes used to study terrestrial turbulent flows .",
    "doubts can arise on whether h@xmath0o  masers are an adequate probe of the geometry of the turbulence dissipation .",
    "for example , due to possible directivity of their radiation , some masing blobs may be unobserved .",
    "can this distort the statistics we study ?",
    "obviously , the non - observability of a fraction of places where turbulence dissipates results in underestimation of the space filling factor of dissipation",
    ". however , this will not affect the deduced fractal dimension of the set on which dissipation takes place , if all the `` eddies , '' down to the smallest ones contain _ some _ amount of observable masers .",
    "this follows from equation  ( 4 ) : reduction of @xmath26 by any factor ( due to non - observability of a fraction of the masers ) will not change the value of the logarithmic derivative , and thus the value of @xmath1 .",
    "if the directivity of the maser radiation is very high , it can affect observability of the smallest eddies , containing relatively small numbers of elementary masers . by an unlucky chance",
    ", all the masers within such an eddy could be turned away from the observer .",
    "the larger eddies , containing more elementary masers , should still be observable , although their contours will be delineated by reduced numbers of maser spots .",
    "a lack of observability of the smaller eddies will result in a decrease of @xmath98 with the decreasing scale [ see equation ( 10 ) ] and in a corresponding change of the slope of the plots in figures  2 - 4",
    ". using equations ( 9 ) , ( 4 ) , and ( 6 ) , it is easy to convince oneself that this would steepen the slope of the plot toward the smallest scales in figures  2 and 4 and flatten it toward the smallest scales in figure  3 .",
    "these effects are either unseen or quite small in these figures .",
    "we believe , therefore , that the majority of the scales , covering almost four orders of magnitude , are well represented by the h@xmath0o  masers and that @xmath1 is determined adequately , regardless of possible omission of a fraction of the maser probes caused by radiation directivity .",
    "\\1 . vlbi maps of five h@xmath0o  maser sources in regions of star formation",
    "reveal fractal spatial distribution of the masing hot spots ; a power - law dependence of two - point velocity increments on spatial scale ; and the non - gaussian statistics of velocity increments ( a strong excess of large deviations from the mean value ) .",
    "all these properties are known as typical of turbulence .",
    "if the h@xmath0o  masers trace turbulence indeed , our quantitative analysis shows that this highly supersonic turbulence is characterized by a much lower fractal dimension ( @xmath63 ) , and thus much stronger intermittency , than incompressible turbulence .",
    "strong intermittency at virtually all the spatial scales is also confirmed by the excess of large velocity increments at all scales .",
    "unexpectedly , the power indices of the low - order velocity structure functions for the putative supersonic turbulence are found to be close to the classic kolmogorov values for high - reynolds - number incompressible turbulence .",
    "this is incompatible with the strong intermittency ( low fractal dimension ) in traditional approaches to turbulence , but may find its explanation in the framework of the new approch put forward by barenblatt and chorin .",
    "supersonic turbulence with a high mach number at its greatest scale may possess an inner scale , at which the bulk of its energy is dissipated in low - mach - number stochastic shocks .",
