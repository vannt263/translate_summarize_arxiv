    "the new generation of air cherenkov tev @xmath1-ray telescopes ( hess , magic , veritas ) have detected about 30 cosmological blazars with strong tev photon emission : the most distant ones are 3c279 ( redshift @xmath2 ) , 3c66a ( @xmath3 ) and pks 1510 - 089 ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "any of these more distant than @xmath5 produces energetic @xmath6 particle beams in double photon collisions with the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) .",
    "these pairs with typical lorentz factors @xmath7 are expected to inverse compton ( ic ) scatter on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation , on a typical length scale @xmath8 mpc , thus producing gamma - rays with energy of order 100 gev , which have not been detected by the fermi satellite .",
    "given the still relatively short distance @xmath9 , both pair production and ic emission occur primarily in cosmic voids of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , which fill most of cosmic volume .",
    "it has been argued that the inverse compton scattered gamma - rays then are still energetic enough for further pair - production interactions giving rise to a full electromagnetic cascade as in vacuum .",
    "however , the pair - beam is subject to two - stream - like instabilities of both electrostatic and electromagnetic nature ( broderick et al . 2012 , schlickeiser et al . 2012a ) . in this case the electromagnetic pair cascade does not contribute to the multi - gev flux , as most of the pair beam energy is transferred to the igm with important consequences for its thermal history .",
    "moreover , there is no need to require the existence of small intergalactic magnetic fields to scatter the produced pairs , so that the explanation of the fermi non - detection of the inverse compton scattered gev gamma rays by a finite deflecting intergalactic magnetic field ( neronov and vovk 2010 , tavecchio et al .",

    "this approximation has been recently criticized by miniati and elyiv ( 2013 ) , who noted that the finite momentum spread of the pair distribution function ( referred to as kinetic instability study ) will significantly reduce the maximum electrostatic growth rate to a level that the full electromagnetic pair cascade as in vacuum is not modified .",
    "the study of cairns ( 1989 ) , based on nonrelativistic kinetic plasma equations , indicated that the kinetic / reactive instability character depends strongly on the plasma beam and plasma background parameters , such as beam density @xmath15 , beam speed @xmath16 and background particle density @xmath17 and temperature @xmath18 .",
    "severe differences between reactive and kinetic instability rates occur particularly for beam to background particle density ratios exceeding @xmath19 . however , as argued below , in our case of pair beams in the igm medium this ratio is of order @xmath20 , much below the critical value @xmath21 , so that we are in a regime where reactive and kinetic instability studies should not differ significantly according to cairns ( 1989 ) .    however , as noted the work of cairns ( 1989 ) is based on nonrelativistic kinetic plasma equations .",
    "it is the purpose of this work to investigate the claim of miniati and elyiv ( 2013 ) for parallel propagating electrostatic fluctuations using the correct relativistic kinetic plasma equations .",
    "relativistic kinetic instability studies are notoriously difficult and complicated due to plasma particle velocities close to the speed of light .",
    "therefore extreme care is necessary in order to include all relevant relativistic effects .",
    "we therefore will repeat in detail the linear instability analysis in the kinetic limit using the realistic pair momentum distribution function . for mathematical simplicity",

    "they found that the pair production spectrum is highly beamed into the direction of the initial gamma - ray photons , so that a highly anisotropic , ultrarelativistic velocity distribution of the pairs results .",
