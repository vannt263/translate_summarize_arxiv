    "in addition to such neural encoding of sensory stimuli , neural synchronization is also correlated with pathological rhythms associated with neural diseases ( e.g. , epileptic seizures and tremors in the parkinson s disease ) @xcite . here , we are interested in these synchronized neural oscillations .",

    "have been investigated , and thus three types of synchronization mechanisms have been found @xcite : recurrent excitation between principal cells , mutual inhibition between interneurons , and feedback between excitatory and inhibitory neurons .",
    "perfect synchronization occurs in the network of pulse - coupled excitatory neurons @xcite .",
    "however , this synchronization via mutual excitation can not be always stable in networks with slowly decaying synaptic couplings .",
    "stability of synchronization is shown to depend on both the time course of synaptic interaction and the response of neurons to small depolarization @xcite .",
    "when the decay time of the synaptic interaction is enough long , mutual inhibition ( rather than excitation ) may synchronize neural firing activities . by providing a coherent oscillatory output to the principal cells ,",
    "interneuronal networks play the role of the backbones ( i.e. , synchronizers or pacemakers ) of many brain oscillations such as the 10-hz thalamocortical spindle rhythms @xcite and the 40-hz fast gamma rhythms in the hippocampus and the neocortex @xcite .",
    "when the feedback between the excitatory and inhibitory populations is strong , neural synchrony appears via the `` cross - talk '' between the two populations @xcite .",
    "most past studies exploring mechanisms of neural synchronization were done in neural systems composed of spontaneously firing ( i.e. , self - oscillating ) suprathreshold neurons . for this case",

    "in contrast , neural systems composed of subthreshold neurons have received little attention . unlike the suprathreshold case",
    ", each subthreshold neuron in the absence of coupling can not fire spontaneously without noise ; it can fire only with the help of noise .",

    "this kind of works may be thought to correspond to a `` subthreshold version '' of neural synchronization through mutual excitation . due to the stochastic spiking coherence ,",

    "this enhancement of coherence resonance in an excitatory network of subthreshold hodgkin - huxley neurons was characterized in terms of the coherence factor @xmath1 , representing the degree of sharpness of the peak in the power spectrum of an individual neuron @xcite . in this way",
    ", the measure @xmath1 is used for characterization of the temporal coherence of an individual neuron .",
    "however , we note that @xmath1 is not a measure for directly measuring the degree of collective coherence in the whole population .    in this paper",
    ", we are concerned about the `` subthreshold version '' of neural synchronization via mutual inhibition . in section [ sec : ml ] , we describe the biological conductance - based morris - lecar ( ml ) neuron model with voltage - gated ion channels @xcite . the ml neurons ( used in our study )",
    "exhibit the type - ii excitability ( i.e. , the firing frequency begins to increase from a non - zero value when the stimulus exceeds a threshold value ) , and they interact via inhibitory gabaergic synapses whose activity increases fast and decays slowly . in section [ sec : ssc ] , we characterize stochastic spiking coherence in a large population of inhibitory subthreshold ml neurons by varying the noise intensity for a fixed coupling strength . weakly coherent states with oscillating ensemble - averaged global membrane potential @xmath2 are thus found to appear in a range of intermediate noise intensity [ i.e. , regular global oscillation ( with reduced amplitude and increased frequency ) emerges via cooperation of irregular individual oscillations ] .",
    "emergence of collective coherence may be well described in terms of the conventional `` thermodynamic '' order parameter which concerns the time - averaged fluctuations of the macroscopic global potential @xmath2 .",
    "we note that this stochastic spiking coherence may be well visualized in the raster plot of neural spikes ( i.e. , a spatiotemporal plot of neural spikes ) which is directly obtained in experiments . for the coherent case ,  stripes \" ( composed of spikes and indicating collective coherence ) are found to be formed in the raster plot . due to coherent contribution of spikes , local maxima of the global potential @xmath2 appear at the centers of stripes .",
    "however , these stripes are partially occupied .",
    "individual inhibitory neurons exhibit intermittent spikings phase - locked to @xmath2 at random multiples of the period of @xmath2 .",
    "this `` stochastic phase locking '' leading to `` stochastic spike skipping '' is well shown in the interspike interval ( isi ) histogram with multiple peaks .",
    "the multi - peaked isi histogram shows some indication of weak collective spiking coherence .",
    "the main purpose of our work is to quantitatively measure the degree of stochastic spiking coherence seen in the raster plot . in section [ sec : ssc ] , we introduce a new type of spike - based coherence measure @xmath0 by taking into consideration the occupation pattern and the pacing pattern of spikes in the stripes of the raster plot . in particular ,",

    "a main difference between the conventional and the new spike - based measures lies in determining the pacing degree of spikes .",
    "the precision of spike timing for the conventional case is given by just the standard deviation of ( microscopic ) individual spike times within an event without considering the quantitative contribution of ( microscopic ) individual spikes to the ( macroscopic ) global activity .",

    ", we characterize the stochastic spiking coherence in terms of the `` statistical - mechanical '' measure @xmath0 in the whole coherent region , and find that @xmath0 reflects the degree of collective coherence seen in the raster plot very well .",
    "when taking into consideration both the occupation degree and the pacing degree of spikes in the raster plot , a maximal spiking coherence occurs near @xmath175 [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : sm2](e ) ] . as discussed in details in section [ sec : int ] , @xmath0 is in contrast to the conventional measures where any quantitative relation between ( microscopic ) individual spikes and the ( macroscopic ) global potential @xmath2 is not considered [ e.g. , the `` thermodynamic '' order parameter @xcite , the `` microscopic '' correlation - based measure @xcite , and the psth - based measures of precise spike timing @xcite ] .",
    "by changing the noise intensity , we have characterized stochastic spiking coherence in an inhibitory population of subthreshold biological ml neurons . in a range of intermediate noise intensity ,",
    "a regularly oscillating global potential @xmath2 ( with reduced amplitude and the increased frequency ) emerges via cooperation of irregular individual firing activities .",
    "we note that this stochastic spiking coherence may be well visualized in the raster plot of spikes . for the case of a coherent state ,",
    "partially - occupied stripes appear in the raster plot .",
    "this partial occupation occurs due to stochastic spike skipping , which is shown clearly in the multi - peaked isi histogram .",
    "recently , brunel and hakim ( 1999 ) have obtained similar results on spike skipping in a simplified network of integrate - and - fire ( if ) neurons which are randomly connected via instantaneous inhibitory synapses ( modeled by the delta function with a transmission delay ) . [ such skipping was also reported in the network of inhibitory and excitatory if neurons @xcite . ] for the case of the if neuron a spike is triggered instantaneously when the membrane potential reaches a threshold , in contrast to the case of the biological ml neuron where dynamics of voltage - gated ion channels leads to spike generation . as the stimulus exceeds a threshold , the firing frequency of the",
    "if neuron begins to increase from zero ( i.e. , the if neuron exhibits the type - i excitability ) , unlike the case of the type - ii ml neuron ( used in our computational study ) .",
    "these type - i if neurons are driven by random excitatory inputs activated by independent poisson processes . in this simplified network",
    ", it was shown that weakly coherent global activities ( roughly corresponding to the global potential @xmath2 ) emerge from irregular firing patterns of neurons [ refer to figure 3 in the paper of brunel and hakim ( 1999 ) ] .",
    "the collective coherence was well shown in the temporal auto - correlation function of the global activity .",
    "although the basic results in the simplified network are similar to ours in a realistic network , there are some differences in the spiking pattern of individual neurons .",
    "the stochastic spike emission of individual if neurons was well shown in the poissonian isi histogram showing little indication of the collective behavior . since no clear multiple peaks appear in the poisson - like isi histogram , the individual if neurons exhibit more stochastic spike emission than the ml neurons , although weak collective coherence occurs in both cases .",
    "there are some additional differences in the effect of the external noise on the collective coherence . as the magnitude of the external noise",
    "is increased from zero and passes a threshold , the global activity was found to exhibit a transition from an oscillatory to a stationary state @xcite .",
    "thus , incoherent states appear for the case of strong noise . on the other hand , through competition between the constructive role ( stimulating coherence between noise - induced spikes ) and the destructive role ( spoiling the collective coherence ) of noise , stochastic spiking coherence ( in our work ) appears in a range of intermediate noise intensities . hence , incoherent states appear for both cases of sufficiently strong and weak noise .",
    "these differences in both the spiking pattern of individual neurons and the noise effect on the collective coherence seem to arise mainly from different types of drivings on individual neurons ; if neurons are driven by random excitatory inputs activated by poisson processes , while ml neurons are driven by a gaussian white noise in addition to a subthreshold dc stimulus .",
    "the main purpose of our work is to quantitatively measure the degree of stochastic spiking coherence seen in the raster plot .",
    "we have introduced a new type of spike - based coherence measure @xmath0 by taking into consideration the occupation degree and the pacing degree of spikes in the stripes .",
    "particularly , the pacing degree between spikes is determined in a statistical - mechanical way by quantifying the average contribution of ( microscopic ) individual spikes to the ( macroscopic ) global potential @xmath2 .",
    "this `` statistical - mechanical '' measure @xmath0 is in contrast to the conventional measures ( e.g. , the `` thermodynamic '' order parameter , the `` microscopic '' correlation - based measure , and the psth - based measures of precise spike timing ) where any quantitative relation between the microscopic individual spikes and the macroscopic global potential @xmath2 is not considered . in terms of @xmath0 , we have quantitatively characterized the stochastic spiking coherence , and found that @xmath0 reflects the degree of collective spiking coherence seen in the raster plot very well .",
    "finally , we also expect that @xmath0 may be implemented to characterize the degree of collective spiking coherence in an experimentally - obtained raster plot of neural spikes .",
