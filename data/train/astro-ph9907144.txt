    "for many years there have been theoretical predictions that accretion discs can undergo outbursts which start either close to their inner edge , or their outer edge ( meyer & mayer ",
    "hofmeister 1984 ; mineshige & osaki 1985 ; ludwig & meyer 1998 ) . in this and the following paper",
    "we use the eclipsing dwarf novae to resolve spatially their outbursts , and prove that one outburst is `` outside  in '' , the other `` inside  out '' @xcite .",
    "this is the first time an `` inside  out '' outburst has been resolved , and should be viewed as a major vindication of disc instability theories . in both cases",
    "we find that the discs have extensive vertical structure , which is shown to be the cause of problems of interpretation in the only other observation of an `` outside  in '' outburst ( vogt 1983 ; rutten et al . 1992 ) .",
    "the dwarf nova observed in this paper is the su uma star ht cas , whose orbital period is about 106 min .",
    "( patterson 1981 ; zhang , robinson & nather 1986 ; wood , horne & vennes 1992 )",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : model_results ]    [ fig : resultgraphs ]      all the fits presented here are models of the r - band data and are detailed in table  [ tab : model_results ] .",
    "we can not match the rise to outburst eclipses with a steady state model , even if we include considerable disc opening angles ( fit 2 in table  [ tab : model_results ] ) .",
    "the eclipses that were generated by the model are always steeper than the data during ingress and egress . during eclipse minimum",
    "the steady state models could not reproduce the flatness shown by the data .    to match the slope and depth of the eclipse",
    "light curves we used the code to calculate the flux from a truncated disc and made the code search for an inner truncation radius that would best match the data for each given outer radius .",
    "the semi - opening angle search in this case was coarser than the full disc models and varied from @xmath4 to @xmath5 in @xmath6 steps .",
    "the resulting models produced a much better fit to the data than the full disc models .",
    "the value returned by the model for the outer disc radius on the rise to outburst was @xmath7 and along with the value for the inner truncation radius of about 4  @xmath0 and a flare angle of @xmath1 produced a fit with a @xmath8 of 1.56 ( fit 1 in table  [ tab : model_results ] ) .",
    "we were still not able to reproduce exactly the flatness exhibited by the data at eclipse minimum , but ingress and egress are very well matched .",
    "thus we conclude that in order to match the eclipses during the rising phase of the outburst , we need a truncated disc .    to prove that both the flare and truncation were required we ran a further set of models ( fit 3 ) , where the disc was truncated but not flared .",
    "the model profile did not match the observed data .",
    "the contact phases of the eclipse wings , which denote the contact phases of the disc edges with the secondary star extend beyond phases @xmath9 and require a disc size of @xmath10 .",
    "the @xmath8 for this model is very large with a value of 20.96    the errors quoted for the semi - opening angle and the mass transfer rate in table  [ tab : model_results ] are empirical errors derived by fitting the data with models that lie above and below the data points .",
    "the outburst eclipses 85700 and 85703 were observed in two colours .",
    "v - band data were taken from keele while the system was also observed in the r - band from st . andrews . since the r - band data from st .",
    "andrews were of lower temporal resolution , we binned the v - band data from keele to match the exact phases of the st .",
    "andrews data .",
    "the resulting @xmath11 eclipse light curve for cycle 85700 can be seen in fig  [ fig : v_r_1 ] . for clarity",
    "the data presented here were binned again into 0.01 phase bins starting from phase -0.1 to phase + 0.1 .",
    "the histograms in fig  [ fig : v_r_1 ] are not model fits , but simply the @xmath11 calculated from the v and r synthetic light curves , created from the best fit parameters for the @xmath12 band data . with a @xmath8 of 0.81 the solid line histogram in fig  [ fig : v_r_1 ] is an adequate description to the data",
    ". a constant of value 0.083 produced a @xmath8 of 1.24 .",
    "non - flared truncated disc models produced a @xmath11 fit with a @xmath8 of 1.51 , but these models gave inadequate fits for the individual v and r eclipses ( see table  [ tab : model_results ] ) .",
    "thus we conclude that the system does not show any significant colour change during eclipse . to further emphasise the point",
    "that we can not match the eclipses without a considerable flaring angle and without an inner truncation radius , we plot the @xmath11 values obtained from our best flat and non - truncated model disc .",
    "clearly this model does not fit the data .      for the eclipse close to the peak of the outburst",
    "the model prefers a smaller disc of radius @xmath13 with a larger flare angle of @xmath14 and also with the smaller inner truncation radius of about 1  @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath8 for this model is 0.74 ( fit 4 ) .",
    "with such a large flaring angle at the peak of outburst and given the @xmath15 inclination of this system , the inner parts on the far side of the accretion disc are hidden from view up to about 3@xmath0 from the surface of the white dwarf .",
    "thus we do not believe that the value of 1  @xmath0 for the inner truncation radius is physically meaningful .",
    "the contours for this eclipse ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cont ] ) confirm this showing that the model is insensitive to values for the inner truncation radius up to about 3@xmath0 from the white dwarf s surface .",
    "the preference of the model to have a truncated disc on the rise to outburst suggests that either there is no material present in the inner most parts of the accretion disc ( at least during the rising phase of the outburst ) or that the hot transition front travelling from the outer parts of the disc towards the centre has not yet reached the inner parts of the accretion disc . in the second case , the inner disc is not void of material , but simply it does not emit significant amounts of flux because the hot transition front has not yet traversed the inner parts of the disc .      for the eclipses on the decline and late decline ,",
    "the best models prefer a non  truncated disc , which show that the transition front , that originated at the outer parts of the disc and is traveling towards the centre has traversed the whole accretion disc , which has now started returning to its quiescent state ( fits 5 and 6 ) .    at this stage",
    "the boundary layer around the white dwarf must have reached its highest optical flux levels of the outburst , and the white dwarf must be significantly hotter than during the rise .",
    "however , we do not observe any effects of irradiation from the inner parts of the disc , the boundary layer , or the white dwarf onto the secondary star during any stage of the outburst .",
    "this could be explained as the effect of a rim wall which prevents radiation from the innermost parts of the disc reaching the secondary star surface .",
    "also , effects of the irradiated secondary could be completely swamped due to the high flux levels of the accretion disc .    during the decline from outburst",
    "there is a phase shift between the models and the actual data .",
    "the mid - eclipse in our models is always centered at phase zero , while the data seem to shift during the outburst , especially during the second night of observations .",
    "regardless of the drift the eclipse profiles retain their high level of symmetry . despite this peculiarity",
    "the model is able to reproduce the overall eclipse profile quite accurately .",
    "undoubtedly , though , these models constitute only an upper limit on the disc radius and flare because the model uses a symmetric accretion disc and therefore any change of the eclipse ingress profile will similarly affect the egress profile . indeed , when we manually shift the data to our calculated phase zero , the model eclipse profiles are in very good agreement with the observed data .",
    "the @xmath16 of the fits drops by a factor of 4 for the case of the early decline and also goes down by a factor of 2 for the modeled eclipse during the late stages of the decline .",
    "although the values derived here for the semi - opening angle and the disc radius only constitute upper limits , they do show that the accretion disc is decreasing in size during the late stages of the decline .",
    "investigation of the results presented in section  [ mted ] show clearly that the november 1995 outburst of ht cas was of the `` outside - in '' type .",
    "we believe that the models show a relatively large luminous disc @xmath7 during the rise to outburst , which then shrinks to @xmath17 in the later stages of the decline",
    ". it might be that the disc was smaller than @xmath7 at the early stages of the rise but unfortunately our coverage does not include observations at these outburst phases .    although our results seem to be in general agreement with the predictions of the models of , a discrepancy is noted .",
    "the quiescent disc radius for ht cas was measured by horne et  al .",
    "( 1991 ) and was found to be @xmath18 where a is the binary separation .",
    "this translates to @xmath19 using a mass ratio of q=0.15 .",
    "this value for @xmath20 is considerably less than our value of @xmath21 during the rise of the outburst .",
    "also , investigation of the su uma system z cha by shows that there is a decrease in radius of the accretion disc in the time between outbursts . assuming that ht cas behaves in a similar manner",
    "this would mean that the pre - outburst disc was even smaller than that quoted by horne et  al .",
    "thus the luminous radius of the disc on the rise to outburst is larger than the physical radius in quiescence .",
    "this contrasts with the predictions of the models by .",
    "they show that a heating wave is initiated by a disc instability in the outer parts of the disc which travels inwards , with the luminous part never reaching the quiescent radius .",
    "this would suggest that during an outburst the disc would have a luminous size roughly the same as that of the quiescent disc , with cool material on the outward side of the hot front expanding slightly in order to preserve angular momentum .",
    "the disc never reaches the tidal radius , which for this system @xmath22 is at @xmath23 .",
    "thus , no superhump is observed during the eruption .",
    "effects in the @xmath24 diagram though are difficult to explain . during eruption , and in particular during the second night of observations the @xmath24 values begin to drift and reach up to a maximum delay of 79 seconds .",
    "the difficulty in explaining this feature as a simple dislocation of the flux centre comes from the fact that the eclipses retain their symmetry .",
    "thus any dislocation of the flux centre must be accompanied by another effect , such as disc asymmetry , in order to counteract the change of flux centre and keep the overall eclipse shape symmetric .    the mass transfer rate through the disc , which is dependent on the distance , is found to be relatively high during the rise ( m=@xmath25 ) .",
    "at the peak of the outburst the model results show a lower value of m=@xmath26 .",
    "this is surprising but it can be explained if we consider that when the system is at the peak of outburst the inner disc , unlike before , is now very hot and luminous .",
    "therefore in order to match the flux level of the system we do not need high mass transfer rates .",
    "the m value quoted by for the january 1985 superoutburst is @xmath27 .",
    "this is about a factor of 2.5 times lower than our m estimate for the rise to outburst .",
    "our slightly higher m values are easily explained by the fact that our disc models include an outer disc rim wall of semi - opening angle of @xmath1 , which covers part of the disc and thus increasing the observed mass transfer rate necessary to match the flux level of the system .    during the decline",
    ", we believe that a cooling front , as described in , moves inward reducing the disc temperature and at least for the duration of the eclipses the disc behaves in a steady state manner .",
    "also , showed that for the case of z cha , for the disc temperature to decrease with time it is necessary for the disc to behave like , or at least be very close to , steady state .",
    "conversely , models by on the decline of the optical fluxes during outbursts of dwarf novae require the accretion disc to be departing from steady state models .",
    "clearly this is not the case that we observe , since our steady state models for the eclipses during the late decline are in good agreement with the observed data .    comparing the results from the eruption of ht cas with other outbursts of su uma systems we see many similarities . in the case of oy car ,",
    "eclipse light curves observed by and later re  examined by show the same kind of behavior as the outburst eclipses of ht cas .",
    "both systems are slowly departing from their quiescent eclipse shape , moving towards a more symmetric shape with a distinct flat eclipse bottom during the early rise .",
    "these results are also in extreme contrast with the results of for the `` inside  out '' outburst of the u  gem system ip peg .      a hot transition front of material , which is moving towards the centre of the disc ,",
    "is suggested by the preference of the modelling code to place a hole ( or non - luminous material ) with a radius of about @xmath28 from the centre of the accretion disc during the rising phase of the outburst .",
    "it is unclear as to whether the disc is truncated or not when at the peak of the outburst , as the flare angle of the disc grows to @xmath14 and so the innermost parts of the disc are hidden from view . during the decline from outburst the truncation radius is zero .",
    "several theories have been put forward in order to explain the delay in the rise of the ultraviolet flux as opposed to the optical .",
    "for example , proposed that the inner parts of the disc remain void of material during quiescence due to irradiation from the white dwarf .",
    "similarly employed a weak magnetic field to truncate the disc , in the same manner as in intermediate polar systems .",
    "also , suggested that a `` siphon '' coronal mass flow was responsible for emptying the inner parts of the accretion disc .",
    "irradiation of the inner parts of the accretion disc by a hot corona that lies above the cool quiescent disc , leads to the evaporation of material in those inner disc regions .",
    "material from the disc joins the hot corona above and then is accreted onto the white dwarf leaving the inner parts of the accretion disc relatively empty .",
    "however , the fact that ht cas shows x - ray eclipses ( wood  et al .",
    "1995 ; mukai  et al .",
    "1997 ) does not support the theory of a hot x - ray producing corona , but instead suggests that the x - ray emitting regions in ht cas are very close to the white dwarf .",
    "there has been previous observational evidence for the truncation of accretion discs in non - magnetic dwarf nova systems .",
    "found evidence of truncated accretion discs for at least four different systems .",
    "they compared the ratio of uv fluxes produced by white dwarfs and accretion discs as predicted by the evaporation theory of meyer and meyer  hofmeister and .    in all three scenarios outlined above",
    ", the delay of the uv flux arises because of the time it takes for the inner parts of the disc to be filled by material in outburst that is moving inwards .",
    "unfortunately we do not possess any uv data for this outburst in order to confirm that our model results are compatible with the above theories .",
    "however , and speculate that the delay in the uv flux observed in the vw hyi system , which was observed simultaneously in the x - ray , uv and optical parts of the spectrum during an eruption , could be explained by such a mechanism .",
    "our data appear to show such a gap being filled .",
    "there is substantial evidence that the disc is highly flared throughout the outburst , especially near the peak of the eruption .",
    "the semi - opening angle of the disc is seen to expand from @xmath1 during the rise to @xmath14 at the peak and then starts to decrease again during the decline .",
    "this could possibly be explained by the `` avalanche '' effect that see in their model calculations .",
    "as the hot front travels towards the inner parts of the disc , it causes the viscosity of the material that has just gone through the heating front to rise sharply .",
    "therefore as the front moves inwards , material that is now in outburst , is piled up behind the hot front perhaps thickening the disc .",
    "as the outburst declines , a cooling front that moves inwards makes the material at the outer parts of the disc return to their quiescent cold state .",
    "again , as the cooling front travels inwards the disc is seen to decrease in size both radially and vertically .",
    "evidence that accretion discs thicken during outburst has been observed by others . in particular , in the case of another two su uma systems , oy car and z cha . for the case of oy car were confronted with a similar problem of not being able to fit the outburst eclipses with a steady state model and they speculate that this could be due to a rim wall shadowing the inner parts of the disc . also , found evidence of a rim wall for oy car by studying the uv and x  ray flux of the 1985 may superoutburst of oy car .",
    "they suggest that the lack of an x  ray eclipse during the superoutburst , the existence of an orbital modulation of the uv flux and the observation that the uv spectra show emission lines which become narrower during eclipse , could be attributed to the fact that the processes taking place in the inner disc are partially hidden from view by a `` disc that has an extensive vertical structure '' .",
    "in addition , found that by using the maximum entropy mapping ( mem ) method , in order to map the normal outburst eclipses of oy car , they had to introduce an extra constant light source , which amounted to 15% of the observed flux from the system .",
    "they speculated that this inconsistency could be attributed to the assumption of their model that the accretion disc height was negligible .",
    "one of the best pieces of observational evidence of flared accretion discs in su uma systems during outburst , came from the investigation of the z cha system by .",
    "they observed in the ultraviolet using the _ hubble space telescope _ and were able to follow the system during two eruption cycles .",
    "mem models with negligible thickness produced an asymmetry creating a spurious ring in their disc maps due to extra flux that the mem models could not account for .",
    "they found that in order to explain the extra flux observed they had to include a disc flare of @xmath29 into their mem models .",
    "blackbody curves were used to estimate the effective temperatures of the disc .",
    "this produces a temperature profile which was very flat and deviated significantly from profiles predicted by steady state models .",
    "they have recently @xcite improved their models using realistic model atmospheres in order to convert their surface brightnesses to effective temperatures , and also included the effect of limb darkening for accretion discs .",
    "they re - analysed their data for the z cha system and found that their temperature profile became steeper than their previous results , but it still did not match the steady state models .",
    "their semi - opening angle for the accretion disc rim wall decreased but still remained considerable with a value of @xmath30 .",
    "given the comprehensive coverage of the november 1995 outburst of ht cas , spanning rise , maximum , and late decline , we were able to follow the changes induced to the light curve of ht cas due to the erupting accretion disc .",
    "the four significant results of this project are listed below .",
    "( i)we have found that the outburst is initiated at the outer edges of the disc at a radius of @xmath7 and that the disc also expands vertically as the outburst evolves reaching a maximum of about @xmath14 when at the peak of the outburst .",
    "these values of the disc flaring might not necessarily mean that the accretion disc is flared to that extent , but they do emphasise that in order to match the observed flux we really do need luminous material that extends considerably above the orbital plane .",
    "( ii)the models require disc semi - opening angles of the order of @xmath1 during the rise to outburst and @xmath14 close to the peak of outburst .",
    "it is not possible to model the system during the rise or at the peak of outburst simply by using conventional steady state models , or just flared disc models .",
    "in fact we have modified the model to search for an inner truncation radius for the disc and the results show that there might exist a heating front during the rise to outburst which moves towards the center of the disc .",
    "the size of the inner truncation radius seems to be about 4  @xmath0 during the rise to outburst .",
    "( iii)using steady state models we do observe the mass transfer rate through the disc to fluctuate by about a factor of 7 from the rise to outburst to late decline .",
    "( iv)on the decline , steady state models , do seem to agree with observational data , although we detect a rather large deviation of the o - c points with the eclipse shape retaining the high level of symmetry during these shifts .",
