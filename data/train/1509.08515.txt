    "recent years have brought direct evidence that an additional component of emission is present both in the diffuse interstellar medium ( e.g. davies et al . 2006 ) and in individual sources on or close to the galactic plane ( e.g. planck collaboration xx , 2011 ; planck collaboration int .",
    "xv , 2014 ) .",
    "this component manifests itself in the microwave regime ( 10 - 60 ghz ) and is often denoted with the term _ anomalous _ , as it appears to be closely correlated with infrared ( ir ) data , therefore suggesting a possible association with dust , despite exhibiting a pronounced excess with respect to the predicted thermal vibrational dust emission at these frequencies .",
    "draine @xmath4 lazarian ( 1998a ) have proposed that very small rotating dust grains ( polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons , i.e. pahs , or very small grains , i.e. vsgs ) are responsible for the observed microwave excess .",
    "the cosmic background imager ( hereafter cbi , padin et al . 2002 ) , observing the sky at 31 ghz and with a synthetic beam of @xmath0 6.8 , detected anomalous microwave emission ( ame ) at a 3.3@xmath1 level in the hii region rcw 49 ( dickinson et al .",
    "the prediction of free - free emission for the source was based on a power - law fit of continuum data in the range 2.7  15 ghz , providing an expected 31 ghz flux of 99.6 @xmath5 13.4 jy , i.e. much lower than the flux measured by cbi of 146.5 @xmath5 5.2 jy .",
    "signatures of ame were also reported by cbi for rcw 175 which , with a 14.3@xmath1 detection ( dickinson et al .",
    "2009 ; tibbs et al .",
    "2012 ) , represents to date the best example of microwave excess emission in an hii region , as well as for 6 other southern hii regions , and by the very small array ( vsa ) in nine hii regions in the northern hemisphere ( todorovic et al .",
    "2010 ) . despite these claims for a detection",
    ", the observational scenario appears far from clear : a sample of sixteeen hii regions observed by scaife et al .",
    "2008 showed no statistically significant excess , and the original claim of an ame detection in the hii region lph+201.6 + 1.6 ( finkbeiner et al .",
    "2002 ) was later revised by cbi ( dickinson et al .",
    "2006 ) and vsa measurements ( scaife et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "[ fig : irac_cbi ]        in general , the possibility of detecting ame in hii regions is very intriguing from a theoretical point of view .",
    "on one side , hii regions are ideal candidates to harbor this emission , as processes common to this type of environment , such as plasma drag and photoelectric effect , can generate enough angular momentum to spin the grains and induce detectable microwave radiation .",
    "however , significant dust grain depletion is expected to occur in hii regions as a consequence of the intense radiation pressure and stellar winds ( inoue 2002 ; draine 2011 ) .",
    "even more importantly , embedded optically thick ultra compact hii ( uchii ) regions could mimic , in this case , an excess at microwave frequencies .",
    "in fact uchii regions are characterized by high emission meaures ( i.e. 10@xmath6 pc @xmath7 ) and by self - absorbed free - free emission at frequencies up to several ghz .",
    "this self - absorbed free - free could potentially generate the observed rising spectrum attributed to ame .",
    "motivated by this complex scenario , in 2008 we requested australia telescope compact array ( atca ) high - resolution observations of rcw 49 .",
    "the goal of the observations was to follow - up on the original cbi detection , in order to shed light on the nature of the reported microwave excess .",

    "noteworthy , the 5 and 19/34 ghz maps reveal morphological differences in correspondance of the _ ridge_. in particular , at 19 ghz and 34 ghz the maps present a few emission features which are either completely absent or only barely visible in the 5 ghz map , despite the fact that the size of these features is compatible with the range of angular scales which the 5 ghz map is sensitive to . for instance , the _ spur _ centered at ( ra , dec ) = ( 10@xmath8 24@xmath9 16.2@xmath10 , -57@xmath11 45@xmath12 02  ) , roughly 40  in size , is quite prominent and diffuse at 19 and 34 ghz , while it is rather faint and filamentary at 5 ghz ( see figure  2 , 3 and 4 ) . likewise , the feature at ( ra , dec ) = ( 10@xmath8 24@xmath9 18.0@xmath10 , -57@xmath11 46@xmath12 45.05  ) , @xmath0 25  long , is again bright and extended at 19/34 ghz , but virtually invisible at 5 ghz ( see figure  2 , 3 and 4 ) .",
    "such differences might be indicative of rising spectral indices or of an additional component of emission at high frequency . at the same time",
    ", they could be ascribed , at least in part , to the sensitivity to different angular scales of the individual data sets .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , the recombination line and continuum observations were performed simultaneously , thus covering the same 7.8@xmath12 @xmath13 5.6@xmath12 area of the sky .",
    "the 5 ghz recombination line data set was reduced again using casa v3.3 .",
    "the average noise level per channel was estimated to be of the order of @xmath0 2.6 mjy / beam .",
    "accordingly , line emission was found only at three positions ( denoted as a , b , c ) located along the _ ridge _ ( see figure  2 ) .",
    "we detected no emission in the inner part of the west shell .    using the task ` viewer ` , we extracted a cumulative spectrum within a box of the same size of the synthetic beam ( @xmath0 7  ) and centered at each position .",
    "in our system configuration we had a continuum bandwidth of 13 mhz , which allowed us to estimate the continuum level , t@xmath37 , by fitting the data , minus the line , with a power - law model .",
    "a gaussian fit was applied to the continuum - subtracted data ( see figure  5 ) .",
    "both the continuum and the line fits were carried out with the matlab fitting tool ( ` cftool ` ) .",
    "the gaussian fit to the line gives the line peak temperature , @xmath38 , central velocity , @xmath39 , and width to half - intensity , @xmath40 ( see table  4 ) .",
    "we estimated the probability of a false detection . from table  4 ,",
    "the statistical significance of the h109@xmath2 line is @xmath0 3@xmath1 in region a and b , and @xmath0 2@xmath1 in region c , which corresponds to a probability of a spurious detection in a single velocity channel of , respectively , 1/370 and 1/50 .",
    "therefore , the probability that at least one out of n velocity channels has a s / n of 3 ( or 2 ) is given by 1 - ( 1 - 1/370)@xmath41 ( or 1 - ( 1 - 1/50)@xmath41 ) .",
    "since we apply the positivity condition , the previous expression becomes 1 - ( 1 - 1/740)@xmath41 ( or 1 - ( 1 - 1/100)@xmath41 ) .",
    "we now consider the number of velocity channels that are effectively used for the detection of the line .",
    "first of all , the channels at the edge of bandwidth are discarded , as they are too noisy to provide any useful information .",
    "this operation brings the number n of channels from 512 to 400 .",
    "in addition , we restrict the search of the line to the velocity range + /-",
    "30 km / s , which is the range of velocities compatible with the position of rcw 49 in the l - v diagram ( see figure  2 of furukawa et al .",
    "this further decreases n from 400 to roughly 40 channels . following these considerations",
    ", we finally estimate that the probability that the lines in region a and b are spurious is 1 - ( 1 - 1/740)@xmath42 @xmath0 0.05 , while for region c is 1 - ( 1 - 1/100)@xmath42 @xmath0 0.33 .",
    "this calculation shows that our detections , especially in region c , are only marginal .    from the recombination lines , we computed the electron temperature , t@xmath43 , by applying the 5-ghz specific relation ( caswell @xmath4 haynes 1987 )    @xmath44    the expression above is an approximation of the shaver et al .",

    "as noted in the introduction , the currently most accredited interpretation for the excess of emission at microwave frequencies is of electric dipole radiation from spinning pahs and/or vsgs , which entails that the emission at 20 - 60 ghz should be always found to spatially correlate with mid - ir emission .",
    "indeed , in their paper , whiteoak & uchida ( 1997 , hereafter wu97 ) remark that the 12/25 @xmath18 m iras and the atca 1.4 ghz data appear to trace common structures , such as the two shells and the _ ridge _ , and that moving towards longer wavelengths ( i.e. 100 @xmath18 m ) , this close correspondence significantly decreases .",

    "2012 ; everett @xmath4 churchwell 2010 ) , in hii regions the emission around 20 @xmath18 m is likely associated to big grains rather than vsgs , contrary to what typically occurs in the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "therefore , to investigate the possible existence of an ir - microwave correlation in rcw 49 , we compared the atca continuum data at 5 , 19 and 34 ghz with the irac 8 @xmath18 m observations from the glimpse survey .",
    "the comparison was performed both in the @xmath19-plane and in real space . for this purpose",
    ", we used the casa ` simulator ` tool which , at each observed atca frequency , allowed us to generate the corresponding visibilities for the irac 8 @xmath18 m data set by taking into account the specific configuration of the interferometer .",
    "in particular , in order to obtain a perfect correspondence between observed and simulated @xmath19-plane coverage , we used the combined ` sm.predict ` and ` sm.openfromms ` functions .",
    "as described in section  2 , the atca 5 ghz data set consists of a single pointing . in this case , to perform the simulation , a correction for the atca primary beam ( @xmath0 570  ) was applied by multiplying the irac 8 @xmath18 m data with a guassian profile , centered at the pointing phase center . on the contrary , the atca 19 and 34 ghz maps were obtained with a mosaic observing strategy .",
    "therefore , a simulation was performed for each pointing and the correction for the primary beam was applied using a gaussian mask of 150  and 80  , respectively .",
    "figure  6 shows the simulated vs observed visibilities at each frequency . in these plots , in order to minimize the correlations in the @xmath19-plane , we binned the @xmath57 cells in 10-min bins at 5 ghz and 1-min bins at 19 and 34 ghz , where the difference in bin width reflects the different integration time at the various frequencies .",

    ", we re - created the observed atca maps by using the same deconvolution parameters as for the simulated data set . in particular , all the observed maps were re - generated using the same hgbom algorithm and the multiscale cleaning method ( cornwell 2008 ) , with three windows of 0 , 5 and 15 pixels , which we used for the irac simulated maps .",
    "the pixel size of all maps was set to 1.2  , and to each map the primary beam correction was applied .",
    "figure  7 illustrates , for the case of the _ ridge _ , a morphological comparison between the simulated irac 8 @xmath18 m and the observed atca 5 , 19 and 34 ghz data . at 5 ghz ( top panel ) , both the 8 @xmath18 m and radio continuum emission peak in the south - east part of the _ ridge _ , although clear descrepancies can be noticed between the two emission components .",
    "indeed , radio emission fills a bubble - like structure located to the north - east of the _ ridge _ , for which no 8 @xmath18 m emission is detected .",
    "such differences become even more evident at 19 and especially at 34 ghz ( middle and bottom panels ) : while the 8 @xmath18 m and microwave emission peaks still spatially coincide towards the east side of the _ ridge _ , the west side is characterized , in the cm maps , by a prominent shell - like structure and by a spur with no ir counterpart .",
    "these shell - like structure and the spur are the same as discussed in section  3.1 .",

    "since different interferometer configurations correspond to different amounts of flux loss , a correct approach to this problem would entail filtering the data in the @xmath19-plane to assure that , at each frequency , we are sensitive to emission on the same angular scales .",
    "however , given the poor overlap in the visibility plane of the atca data set , if we followed this strategy we would remain with virtually no data to analyze .    to circumvent this problem",
    ", we considered only low frequency data and , in particular , a combination of our new 5 ghz data and of archival atca 1.4 ghz data from wu97 .",
    "these two data sets are characterized by sufficient overlap in the @xmath19-plane to allow the generation of a reliable spectral index map .",
    "to this end , the @xmath19- range of the 1.4 ghz data was truncated to match the shortest @xmath19-coverage of the 5 ghz data ( e.g. 1.1 k@xmath63 ) .",
    "in addition , since the 5 ghz data still have a denser @xmath19-coverage at short spacings , we truncated these to the same maximum @xmath19-distance of the 1.4 ghz dataset ( e.g. 20.55 k@xmath63 ) , in order to guarantee a similar shape of the weighting function during the imaging process .",
    "it is important to emphasize that this operation does not lead to matched beams at 1.4 ghz and 5 ghz , but simply mitigates the influence of extended structures at 1.4 ghz , and avoids underweighting of the short spacings at 5 ghz .",
    "after cleaning , the 1.4 ghz and 5 ghz maps were restored with the same synthetic beam ( 15  ) .",
    "the maps were then converted in jy / pixel units , and pixels below 3 times the standard deviation computed for each map were discarded .",
    "finally , for each pixel the spectral index ( s@xmath64 @xmath0 @xmath65 ) was computed using the relation :    @xmath66    figure  8 shows the spectral index map , and its associated uncertainty map , obtained following the aforementioned steps .",
    "the noisy behaviour , especially at the edges of the central stucture ( the _ ridge _ ) and of the two shells , likely derives from small differences of the synthetic beams at 1.4 and 5 ghz .",
    "note that emission contribution on specific spatial scales might differ pixel to pixel , introducing a bias on the reconsctructed spectral index map which is difficult to quantify .",
    "although we can not directly estimate the uncertainty associated with the interpolation of the sampling function , it is commonly accepted that this is a function of the @xmath19-weigths , hence of the noise .",
    "therefore we assume that the error map obtained by considering the average rms is a good representation of the uncertainty of the spectral index map .",
    "in particular , we determined the error map in each pixel by propagating eq .",
    "( 4 ) , i.e. , as :    @xmath67    where @xmath1 was evaluated at different positions of the maps and then averaged .",
    "we emphasize that the above relation does not take into account modelling errors and/or systematics , which are difficult to quantify .",
    "as shown in figure  8 , right panel , the uncertainty in the central part of the _ ridge _ and in a large part of the southern shell varies between + 0.05 and + 0.1 , while at the edges of the emission regions it increases up to about + 0.3 .",
    "[ fig : sp_map ]         if we exclude the noisy pixels ( i.e. , those with an associated uncertainty greater than 0.1 ) , the mean of the spectral index distribution is + 0.20 @xmath5 + 0.22 .",
    "this is consistent ( within 1.5@xmath1 ) with optically thin free - free emission ( @xmath2 = -0.1 ) , likely due to the ionizing flux from the ob stars in the wd2 cluster .",
    "however , the dispersion around the mean is quite significant .",
    "in particular , both the _ ridge _ and the west shell are characterized by positive spectral indices .",
    "benaglia et al .",
    "( 2013 ) have recently published two spectral index maps of rcw 49 : the first one , derived from the combination of archival atca 1.4 and 2.4 ghz data , covers both the _ ridge _ and the shells , while the second , generated from newly obtained 5.5 and 9.0 ghz data , covers only the _ ridge_. the 1.4  2.4 ghz spectral index map is sensitive to angular scales up to several arcmins .",
    "the 5.5  9.0 ghz map is sensitive only up to scales of the order of 100  , that is a smaller scale than the maximum one which our 1.4  5.0 ghz map is sensitive to ( @xmath0 3.4 ) .",
    "the spectral index map obtained from the lower frequency data ( their figure  5 ) appears to be fully compatible with optically thin free - free emission .",
    "this map also shows a possible contribution from synchrotron emission , especially along the northern side of the _ ridge _ and in the west shell .",
    "conversely , the spectral index map associated with the higher frequency data ( their figure  6 ) shows positive spectral indices . indeed a large fraction of the _ ridge _ appears to be characterized by spectral indices greater than + 0.3 , in agreement with our analysis .",
    "interestingly , values of the order of + 0.6 are typically associated with stellar winds ( e.g. , panagia @xmath4 felli 1975 ) and , in general , a global distribution with rising spectral indices might corroborate the hypothesis , advanced by wu97 , that the _ ridge _ is the product of the direct collision between the high - velocity winds produced by wr20a and wr20b in the two shells or , alternatively , of a collision between the two shells before merging .",
    "remarkably , this collision scenario could also explain the increase of dust temperature along the _ ridge _ noted by the same authors .",
    "as we discussed in section  2 , one of the main objectives of the atca observations was to assess the presence , in the core of rcw 49 , of compact high - density components which could account for an inverted emission spectrum at microwave frequencies . in the altenhoff et al .",
    "( 1960 ) approximation , the free - free optical thickness , @xmath68 , is a function of t@xmath43 , @xmath45 and em according to :    @xmath69    where t@xmath43 is in k , @xmath45 in ghz and em in pc @xmath7 . for t@xmath43 of the order of 8000 k",
    ", we expect @xmath70 1 at 31 ghz , which is the frequency of the cbi tentative detection of ame in rcw 49 , when em is greater than @xmath0 10@xmath71 pc @xmath7 .",
    "these extremely high emission measures are typical of hyper - compact hii regions ( hchii ) , which are also characterized by high electron densities ( n@xmath72 10@xmath73 @xmath74 ) and linear diameters of less than @xmath0 0.05 pc .",
    "the very small size of these objects make them good candidates for being responsible for the emission observed by the cbi while remaining virtually undetected in its low - resolution beam .",
    "moreover , the existence of hchiis in the core of rcw 49 would be consistent with a triggering scenario , which is known to be common in galactic hii regions ( elmegreen 1998 ; deharveng et al .",
    "it is remarkable , from this point of view , that the glimpse observations of rcw 49 have indeed allowed the identification of some 300 likely young stellar objects ( ysos ) , representing a new generation of star formation , possibly triggered by the stellar winds and shocks associated with the wd2 cluster ( whitney et al .",
    "this yso population is found in six different regions spread across rcw 49 , none of which coincides with the 31-ghz cbi emission peak .",
    "the closest region ( denoted region 3 by whitney et al .",
    "2004 ) is situated to the south - west of the cbi peak , and at a distance of @xmath0 2.    from the analysis of the h109@xmath2 data set described in section  3.2 , we estimated the emission measure and electron density at three different positions along the _ ridge_. we recall that no line emission was found , above the sensitivity level , at any other locations , although we should emphasize that the thermal continuum emission also encompasses only @xmath0 1/20@xmath75 of the 7.8@xmath12 @xmath13 5.6@xmath12 covered area ( roughly 147 beams out of 2950 ) .",
    "table  4 shows that the average em is @xmath0 160 pc @xmath7 , with a corresponding n@xmath43 of only @xmath0 13 @xmath74 .",
    "these values are indicative of ionized gas denser than in typical ism conditions , for which 0.03 @xmath76 n@xmath77 0.08 @xmath74 ( haffner al . 2009 ) , supporting the compressed - by shocks hypothesis formulated by wu97 , yet this same gas appears to be much more diffuse than in hchiis . from the non - detection of h109@xmath2 , we can set lower limits for the electron temperature and emission measure through most of the 5 ghz map . for this purpose , we assume as representative of the non - detection region , t@xmath78 @xmath79 60 mjy / beam and @xmath80v = 8.2 km / s .",
    "the latter is the average value for the h109@xmath2 line in regions a , b and c. setting the detection threshold at 3@xmath1 , where @xmath1 = 2.6 mjy / beam , and using equation  ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) , we obtain t@xmath43 @xmath81 9740 k , em @xmath81 376 pc @xmath7 , and n@xmath43 > 19.4 @xmath74",
    ". therefore our rrl measurements can not completely rule out the presence of hchiis in the core of rcw 49 .",
    "however , considering that the spectral index map derived in section  4.2 shows no evidence of self - absorbed free - free emission ( @xmath2 @xmath0 2 ) , which would certainly characterize such dense condensations of ionized material , we confidently state that it is unlikely that the cbi detection can be attributed to a hidden population of hciis .",
    "the main limitation to keep in mind in interpreting our results is the fact that the atca is an interferometer working at arcsec resolution and , as such , it is subject to significant flux loss on angular scales larger than a few arcmins . in our case",
    ", this means that , although the area imaged with the atca is 7.8@xmath12 @xmath13 5.6@xmath12 , at 5 , 19 and 34 ghz , the emission on angular scales larger than 3.4 , 1.7 and 1 , respectively , is filtered out .",
    "the total 31-ghz flux detected by cbi towards rcw 49 in a 6.8 beam is 146.5 @xmath5 5.2 jy . if we integrate the atca 5 ghz flux in a similar aperture , we obtain 10.3 jy which , when extrapolated to 31 ghz using the mean spectral index value ( + 0.20 @xmath5 + 0.22 ) derived in section  4.2 , gives 14.82 jy , that is @xmath0 10@xmath3 of the cbi observed flux . a similar calculation at 19 and 34 ghz provides , respectively , 31 ghz projected fluxes of 10.18 jy and 3.11 jy corresponding to 7@xmath3 and 2@xmath3 of the cbi flux .",
    "these estimates clearly show that , because at all atca frequencies we are losing an important fraction of flux , we have to be careful in generalizing the results of our analysis , especially those regarding the spectral indices . however , it is still possible that , due to the uncertainties inherent to the filtering process in the @xmath19-plane , more than the 30@xmath3 of the spectral indices are actually positive and not consistent with the canonical value for optically thin free - free emission . in the hypothesis",
    "where this rising can be ascribed to a collission between shells or stellar winds , it is hard to imagine that such an energetic phenomenon would affect the emission only on small angular scales .",
    "alternatively , we can speculate that the rising that we observe between 1.4 and 5 ghz is already indicative of ame at these low frequencies .",
    "if this was the case , the implication would be that pahs with a larger size range than typically adopted by spinning dust models ( 3.5 to 100  , e.g. ali - hamoud et al .",
    "2009 ) are likely contributing to the emission .",
    "one important thing to notice is that in rcw 49 the location of the cbi peak is offset ( @xmath0 50  ) with respect to the peak of dust emission ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "this is also the case of rcw 175 , for which tibbs et al .",
    "( 2012 ) have shown , by means of a detailed modelling analysis of the dust content of the region , that the ame peak does not coincide with the peak of the pah and vsg spatial distributions , and that such a shift can not be attributed to instrumental effects e.g. , the cbi pointing error ( up to 30  ) or its low angular resolution .",
    "this finding alone suggests that either the detected ame is not due to spinning dust or , if the origin of the emission is indeed spinning dust , other factors ( such as gas ions , etc . )",
    "might play a pivotal role in triggering this type of emission , as discussed in tibbs et al .",
    "we presented the analysis of atca multi - frequency observations ( 5 , 19 and 34 ghz ) of a 7.8@xmath12 @xmath13 5.6@xmath12 region centered on the core of rcw 49 , the brightest hii region in the southern hemisphere . at 5 ghz",
    "we observed both the continuum and the h109@xmath2 hydrogen recombination line . using this new atca data set , we investigated the potential correlation between the radio continuum emission at each observed frequency and the 8 @xmath18 m emission , which is dominated by the 7.7 @xmath18 m feature commonly attributed to pahs .",
    "our analysis shows that , overall , the correlation persists from short ( 5 ghz ) to long wavelengths ( 34 ghz ) , and from large ( @xmath0 3.4 ) to small ( 0.4  ) angular scales .",
    "however , we found an indication of a weakening of the correlation going to higher frequencies and to small angular scales . by combining , respectively , new and archival 5 ghz and 1.4 ghz atca data",
    ", we generated a spectral index map ( and its corresponding error map ) for the region , encompassing both the _ ridge _ and the shells .",
    "the spectral index distribution is globally consistent with optically thin free - free emission , although it is characterized by a large dispersion .",
    "in particular , @xmath0 30@xmath3 , 20@xmath3 and 10@xmath3 of the spectral indeces are greater than + 0.3 , + 0.4 and + 0.5 , respectively , with an average error of less than + 0.1 .",
    "these positive indeces are found mostly along the south side of the _ ridge _ and of the west shell .",
    "this rising of the spectral index distribution might suggest that other mechanisms , other than spinning dust , are responsible for the microwave excess observed by cbi , such as shocks due to a collision event either between the west and east shells or between the stellar winds generated by wr20b and wr20a , as speculated by wu97 .",
    "finally , the combined analysis of the spectral index map with the h109@xmath2 recombination line , marginally detected at three positions along the _ ridge _ , appears to suggest that the core of rcw 49 is likely not harboring very compact sources such as hchii regions , thus not supporting an inverted free - free emission scenario as explanation for the cbi 31 ghz excess .",
    "we believe that this study has mostly shown the importance of obtaining high angular resolution observations even for sources which have been studied for more than a century , like hii regions .",
    "these observations are in fact key in revealing the complexity of physical mechanisms at work in these objects , in particular in very extended and evolved ones such as rcw 49 . without this detailed information",
    "it is difficult to interpret unambiguously the emission seen at relatively low angular resolution at microwave frequencies .",
