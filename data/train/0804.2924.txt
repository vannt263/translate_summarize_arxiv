    "although the radii of other resolved disks ( e.g. , fomalhaut ) are typically only about 150 au , we find that the @xmath0  oph disk is almost four times as large .",
    "we combine this size measurement with the detailed spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the disk to derive its properties , and compare them to those of a small sample of debris disks with similar host stars .",
    "the observations presented here are from various _ spitzer _ programs .",

    "we used deep observations of the non - excess a4 v star @xmath8  eri  measurement ( 247@xmath43 mjy ) and an updated irs spectrum show no excess in this source . ] to determine the psf . at 24 @xmath1 ,",
    "the full - width - half - maximum ( fwhm@xmath9 ) of the @xmath8  eri image is 552@xmath6548 using a 2-d gaussian fitting function on a field of 26with an uncertainty of 002@xmath6002 based on @xmath2100 calibration star observations .",
    "the @xmath8  eri image was scaled to the expected photospheric flux density of @xmath0  oph and to 1.6 times this value for psf subtraction .",

    "an elliptical outer disk along the position angle of @xmath256  is seen in the over - subtracted image , while the photospheric - subtracted image confirms that much of the disk emission lies within the psf .",

    "there are no disk - like residuals in the subtracted image .",
    "the fwhm@xmath9 of the photosphere - subtracted @xmath10  lep image ( 561@xmath6555 ) gives a characteristic resolution for a red point source , slightly broader than given by a blue psf ( @xmath8  eri ) .",

    "the source appears slightly elongated at 70 @xmath1  ( figure 1c ) .",
    "no photospheric subtraction is needed because the disk is @xmath250 times brighter than the stellar photosphere .",
    "however , the faint extended disk emission is more evident after the subtraction of a psf representing the bright inner disk ( figure 1d ) .",
    "the faint extended emission can be traced up to @xmath218(@xmath2520 au , at 3-@xmath11 level ) in radius along the position angle of @xmath255 .",
    "the disk has a fwhm@xmath12 of 185@xmath6161 determined using a gaussian fitting on a field of 55 .",
    "examining two blue calibration stars ( hd 48348 and hd 48915 ) , a typical fwhm@xmath12 of 153@xmath6144 with an uncertainty of 02@xmath6006 was determined , suggesting that the @xmath0  oph image core at 70 @xmath1  is 1.2@xmath61.1 times wider than a blue psf , and resolved at 16- and 28-@xmath11 levels for the major and minor axises .",
    "the position angle of the disk determined from both 24 and 70 @xmath1  images is 55@xmath42 .",
    "the mips slit ( width of 198 ) was at the position angle of @xmath295  when the sed - mode observation was taken .",
    "a small fraction of the faint extended disk emission was outside the slit , which may explain the slightly lower ( @xmath25% ) sed - mode flux compared to the fine - mode photometry .",
    "the broadband excess photometry at 24 and 70 @xmath1  indicates a color temperature ( t@xmath13 ) of 81 k , which over predicts the observed flux at 2835 @xmath1  and 5565 @xmath1  ( see figure [ sed ] ) .",
    "this suggests that the dust grains in the system have a wider range of temperatures . to model the disk sed ( figure [ excess_sed ] )",
    ", we use a simple geometrically - thin debris disk model where the central star is the only heating source and the dust is distributed radially between inner ( r@xmath14 ) and outer ( r@xmath15 ) radii according to a @xmath16 power law for the surface number density .",
    "the grains in the disk follow a @xmath17 size distribution with a minimum radius of @xmath18 and a maximum radius of @xmath19 , assumed to be the same throughout the disk . to minimize the free parameters , we assume that the grains are astronomical silicates ( laor & draine 1993 ) with a density of 2.5 g @xmath20 and are in theoretical collisional equilibrium ; i.e. @xmath21 .",
    "[ excess_sed ]    we determined the best - fit kurucz model for the stellar photosphere by fitting the optical to near - ir photometry ( su et al .",
    "2006 ) , and estimated the stellar temperature and luminosity to be 9750 k and 28.6 l@xmath22 .",
    "with these stellar parameters , grains smaller than @xmath25 @xmath1  are subject to radiation pressure blowout since @xmath23 , the ratio between radiation and gravitational forces ( burns et al .  1979 ) , is @xmath24 0.5 . to capture the slope of the irs spectrum and mips sed - mode data , we selected two points ( 26.5 and 30 @xmath1 ) in the irs spectrum and four wavelengths ( 55.4 , 65.6 , 75.8 , and 86.0 @xmath1 ) in the mips sed - mode data for the global sed fitting .",
    "combined with the broadband photometry , a total of ten data points shown as stars in figure [ excess_sed ] are used to compute @xmath25 to determine the best - fit debris disk model .    to fit the fairly flat slope between 55 and 95 @xmath1  and the observed flux at 350 @xmath1  simultaneously , the maximum grain size has to be @xmath26100 @xmath1 .",
    "this might be an artifact of the assumption that the grains have the same size distribution throughout the disk ( see  [ discussion ] ) .",
    "in addition , since there are no obvious silicate features , the majority of the grains in the disk are larger than a few microns . therefore , we assume @xmath18 to be the blowout size , @xmath25 @xmath1 , and @xmath19 to be @xmath263 @xmath1 , and that the disk has a constant surface density consistent with a poynting - robertson ( p - r ) drag dominated disk . with these grain properties and density distribution ,",
    "the sed is consistent with a 1-component disk with an inner radius of 13@xmath27 au and outer radius of 430@xmath28au .",
    "however , a p - r drag dominated disk is not expected physically given the high disk density ( fractional luminosity @xmath299@xmath610@xmath30 ) since collisions should destroy grains before they can spiral inward ( wyatt 2005 ) .",
    "we also explored the possibility of fitting the sed with an outflow disk , in which the majority of the grains are smaller than the blowout size and the surface density follows a @xmath31 power law ( e.g. , the vega debris disk ; su et al .",
    "various combinations of @xmath18 , @xmath19 , r@xmath14 and r@xmath15 were tried , and none yield a correct spectral slope between 2030 @xmath1  ( one example is shown in figure [ excess_sed ] ) .",
    "in addition , because smaller grains have higher temperatures than larger ones at the same radius , models including grains smaller than the blowout size force r@xmath14 to be a large distance ( @xmath2100 au=34 ) , contradicting the observed compact core of the disk .",
    "this suggests that the @xmath0  oph system can not be an outflow disk entirely .",
    "[ cut24n70 ]      limited by the spatial resolutions , no multiple disk components can be distinguished in the observed images except for the extent of the disk . to further constrain the model , we constructed model images with the best - fit sed parameters ( @xmath32=0 , @xmath335 @xmath1 , @xmath3463 @xmath1 , r@xmath14=13@xmath27 au , and r@xmath15=430@xmath28 au ) from the sed fitting .",
    "these model images were then convolved with appropriate psfs to compare with the observed images based on the fwhms and radial surface brightness distributions .    for a geometrically thin disk model ,",
    "the observed disk morphology only depends on how the disk is viewed , i.e. , the inclination angle of the disk with respect to the plane of the sky , @xmath35 .",
    "we first explored the influence of the outer radius by fixing r@xmath14=13 au , the grain parameters and @xmath35=90 .",
    "the fwhm@xmath9 of the convolved model images with outer radii ranging from 350 to 1000 au shows no change , but a major - axis fwhm@xmath12 of the convolved model images varies from 170 to 204 with the minor - axis fwhm@xmath12 of 142 .",
    "this again confirms that the 24 @xmath1  emission arises from warm grains that are not sensitive to the outer extent of the disk .",
    "the observed major - axis fwhm@xmath12 of the disk ( 185 ) implies a r@xmath15 of @xmath2520 au . with the r@xmath14 , r@xmath15 and grain parameters fixed , we determined the inclination angle by fitting both major- and minor - axis fwhms . convolved model images were constructed for face - on ( @xmath35=0 ) to edge - on ( @xmath35=90 ) disks in increments of 5 .",
    "the major - axis fwhms of the model images remain the same within measurement errors at both 24 and 70 @xmath1 . from 0  to 90 , the minor - axis fwhm@xmath9 and fwhm@xmath12 changed from 61 to 56 and 176 to 142 , respectively .",
    "we conclude that the observed fwhms at 24 and 70 @xmath1  are consistent with a disk viewed at @xmath35=50@xmath45 .    for a quantitative comparison , we show cuts along the disk major axis for both the observed and best - fit model images at 24 and 70 @xmath1   in figure [ cut24n70 ] .",
    "similar cuts made on point - source psfs , scaled to match the peak values of the observations , are also shown .",
    "our simple 1-component , bound - grain debris disk model is in very good agreement with the observed disk surface brightness at 24 @xmath1  over a dynamic range of two orders of magnitude . at 70 @xmath1 ,",
    "the observed signal - to - noise ratios are not as good as at 24 @xmath1 , but the model agrees to within the estimated uncertainties and approximates the data much better than a point source .",
    "based on the _ spitzer _ images and sed modeling , the disk around @xmath0  oph has inner and outer boundaries of @xmath213 and @xmath2520 au , respectively , viewed at an inclination angle of @xmath250 , assuming a 1-component constant - surface ( @xmath32=0 ) density disk consisting of bound ( 563 @xmath5 m ) astronomical silicate grains .",
    "the dust mass is @xmath21.0@xmath610@xmath36 m@xmath37 .",
    "the star s projected rotation velocity is 210 km  s@xmath7 ( royer et al .",
    "2007 ) , suggesting an equatorial velocity of 256 - 300 km  s@xmath7 with @xmath35 ranging from 55to 45 .",
    "although these values are very close to the maximum permissible velocity ( gulliver et al .",
    "1994 ) , the estimated disk inclination angle is within the permitted range of plausible stellar inclination angles .    the broadband sed alone provides too little information to constrain properly the variables needed for even the simplest disk models , but a better understanding can be achieved by considering other constraints .",
    "the exact r@xmath14 of the disk is sensitive to @xmath18 used in the model . the fact that the excess emission starts at @xmath3815",
    "@xmath1  suggests that dust exists as close as @xmath210 au , assuming blackbody radiators .",
    "since the grains in a debris disk are generated by collisional cascades from large ( @xmath2km - size ) parent bodies , @xmath19 is usually assumed to be @xmath21000 @xmath1 . to make the single component model consistent with the faint extended disk detected at 70 @xmath1  and with the assumed grain size distribution",
    ", @xmath19 has to be reduced to @xmath263 @xmath1 .",
    "a more physically realistic model will involve multiple components while requiring the presence of very large grains in the disk .",
    "we used a three - component disk to derive a model consistent with the expected grain physics and the observed spectrum / sed .",
    "the three components are : ( 1 ) a narrow ( @xmath39r@xmath20.1r ) ring of parent bodies at @xmath280 au where large grains are located ; ( 2 ) an outflow disk ( 80520 au ) with density @xmath40 outside the narrow ring consisting of grains being ejected by radiation pressure with sizes smaller than the blowout size ; ( 3 ) a component with density @xmath41 interior to the narrow ring and extending to @xmath210 au ( e.g. , as of grains slowly drifting inward due to p - r drag ) .",
    "many combinations of parameters in this three - component disk model would yield acceptable fits to the observed data .",
    "one example is shown in figure [ excess_sed ] , but it is not unique without further constraints .    given the exceptionally large disk seen in the @xmath0  oph images",
    ", one may wonder whether it is another vega - like disk ( an outflow disk observed at 24 and 70 @xmath1  extending from a ring of large parent bodies that dominate the emission at 850 @xmath1 , su et al .",
    "the failure to fit all of the available data with our simple 1-component outflow model suggests that the contribution by grains escaping from the @xmath0  oph disk is weak , unlike for the vega disk where such grains dominate the disk emission ( @xmath2100% at 24 @xmath1  and @xmath275% at 70 @xmath1 ) .",
    "persuasive evidence of @xmath0  oph being another vega - like disk would require the disk size at 350 @xmath1  to be substantially smaller than the size inferred in the infrared .",
    "however , the signal - to - noise of the 350 @xmath1  data is too low to show the extent of the emission .",
    "observations at longer submillimeter or millimeter wavelengths and higher spatial resolution are needed to determine the exact location and amount of the cold component .    an attractive comparison sample of debris disks for @xmath0  oph is defined by systems with stellar ages between 150 and 400 myr , spectral types between a0v and a3v , and @xmath42 between @xmath43 and @xmath44 , for which su et al .  ( 2006 )",
    "find a total of 12 stars  oph , vega and fomalhaut : @xmath45  cen : t@xmath46250 k , @xmath10  lep : t@xmath46206 k , @xmath47  crb : t@xmath46125 k , @xmath23  uma : t@xmath46116 k , 30  mon : t@xmath46105 k , hd  38056 : t@xmath4696 k , hd  79108 : t@xmath4688 k , @xmath48  boo : t@xmath4686 k , @xmath0  tri : t@xmath4675 k. ] including the resolved disks around vega and fomalhaut .",
    "the disk around fomalhaut defines the expected template structure given our knowledge of the solar system .",
    "it consists of two separate dust belts : a kuiper - belt - analog ring with a radius of @xmath2150 au prominent at @xmath4970 @xmath1  and a fair amount of zodiacal - analog warm dust located @xmath2620 au from the star .",
    "little emission originates from outside of the kuiper belt ring . in the fomalhaut disk ,",
    "the ratio between the central unresolved and the extended emission is 36 at 24 @xmath1  ( stapelfeldt et al .",
    "2004 ) , while the ratio is @xmath223 in the @xmath0  oph disk .",
    "the kuiper - belt - analog ring in the fomalhaut system totally dominates the emission at 70 @xmath1 , but at the distance of @xmath0  oph ( @xmath24@xmath6 that of fomalhaut ) , such a ring would be unresolved .",
    "two of the twelve systems ( @xmath10  lep and @xmath45  cen ) have 24 to 70 @xmath1  color temperatures @xmath24 200 k ( su et al .  2006 ) .",
    "ground - based 20 @xmath1  imaging of @xmath10  lep shows it to be dominated by a very compact inner warm disk ( moerchen et al .",
    "three more systems ( 30 mon , @xmath23  uma , @xmath47  crb ) have color temperatures of 100150 k , indicating relatively large amounts of material in their inner zones .",
