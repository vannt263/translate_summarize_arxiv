    "<S> we investigate phase transitions for the walecka model at very high temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> as is well known , depending on the parametrization of this model and for the particular case of a zero chemical potential ( @xmath0 ) , a first order phase transition is possible @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate this model for the case in which @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that , in this situation , phases with different values of antinucleon - nucleon ratios and net baryon densities may coexist . </S>",
    "<S> we present the temperature versus antinucleon - nucleon ratio as well as the temperature versus the net baryon density for the coexistence region . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature versus chemical potential phase diagram is also presented .    </S>",
    "<S> pacs number(s ) : 21.65.+f,24.10.jv,21.30.-x,21.60.-n    finite nuclei and nuclear matter properties have been reasonably well described by the walecka model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this renormalizable model employs nucleons and mesons ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) as the degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> the sources for the fields are the scalar ( @xmath4 ) and vector ( @xmath5 ) densities associated with the lorentz scalar ( @xmath6 ) and vector ( @xmath7 ) interactions . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that this model , after the fitting of the experimental infinite nuclear matter binding energy at the saturation density , gives for this system a high bulk incompressibility , as well as a high spin - orbit splitting energy , when applied for finite nuclei . in order to overcome this problem , </S>",
    "<S> nonlinear relativistic hadronic models which include cubic and quartic scalar mesonic sef - couplings have been proposed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the preliminary success of this kind of nonlinear walecka model , estimulated the proposal of different parametrizations to better describe nuclear matter properties @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> still aiming at refining its predictions for nuclear matter and neutron stars properties , new kinds of models including scalar(vector ) self - coupling interactions added to usual nonlinear walecka models @xcite have been constructed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> effective hadronic models with density dependent coupling constants have also been proposed @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in general , ( non)linear walecka models models @xcite have been investigated under extreme density and temperature regimes . </S>",
    "<S> most of such studies focus on the hadronic quark - gluon plasma phase transition , which is not the aim of our present work . here </S>",
    "<S> , our purpose is to extend the very interesting work of theis et al @xcite . in their study @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , the walecka model was investigated in the extreme high temperature regime in which the chemical potential ( @xmath0 ) is zero . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a situation in which the net baryon density ( @xmath8 ) also vanishes . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , the number of nucleon and anti - nucleon are the same . </S>",
    "<S> this study showed that , in this nucleon - antinucleon plasma at very high temperature , a phase transition exists .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we will investigate the walecka model under an extreme temperature regime , but allowing the number of anti - particles and particles to be different in the two phases it can lead to . </S>",
    "<S> the question we pose here is whether by allowing different ratios of nucleons - anti - nucleons a phase transition scenario is still present , as in the particular case @xmath9 , still in the so called no - sea approximation . </S>",
    "<S> that is , we consider explicitly only the valence fermi and dirac sea states . </S>",
    "<S> let us here remark that such an approximation , as investigated carefully by the ohio group @xcite , becomes good at low energies , where the contributions of the dirac sea can be renormalized in effective coupling constants . </S>",
    "<S> of course , a rigorous way to perform our investigation would be to include vacuum polarization effects in the walecka model for high excitation energies , where the anti - particles play an essential role . </S>",
    "<S> this treatment , however , is beyond the scope of this work and we perform an exploratory investigation even though the validity of the no - sea approximation in this regime may not be granted .    nowadays , </S>",
    "<S> high energy experiments reveal evidence of nuclear systems with very small baryonic density in the study of particle yields measured in central @xmath10 collision at rhic . different experimental analysis ( star , phenix , phobos , brahms ) furnish the antiproton - proton ratio @xmath11 for a temperature of @xmath12 and a chemical baryonic potential of @xmath13 estimated from thermal models to fit antiparticle - particle ratios @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> high energy @xmath14 collisions show that this ratio reach values around 0.9 @xcite . if relativistic hadronic models are to be used in the description of the multiplicity observed today in ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions @xcite , the behavior of these models at high temperature regimes may be of importance .    </S>",
    "<S> the thermodynamics of the walecka model may be given , for finite temperature , in terms of the energy density and pressure functionals , @xmath15 and @xmath16 where @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 and in the expressions above , @xmath21 is the degeneracy factor ( @xmath22 for nuclear matter and @xmath23 for neutron matter ) , @xmath24 and @xmath25 stand for the fermi - dirac distribution for baryons and antibaryons respectively , with arguments @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath27 is given by @xmath28 , whereas an effective chemical potential , which preserves the number of baryons and antibaryons in the ensemble , is defined by @xmath29 , @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the thermodynamic chemical potential . </S>",
    "<S> the solution for the equation of state is obtained explicitly through the minimization of @xmath32 relative to the scalar field , or equivalently to @xmath33 , @xmath34    this equation , known as the gap equation , has to be solved self - consistently with eqs . </S>",
    "<S> [ energy]-[pressure ] and provides the basis for obtaining all thermodynamic quantities in the mean field approach we are using .    usually , the constants @xmath35 and @xmath36 are determined in favor of the experimental nuclear matter binding energy ( @xmath37 ) at the saturation density ( @xmath38 ) , at @xmath39 . at finite temperature , this model predicts a critical liquid - gas behavior as a van der waals eos . </S>",
    "<S> its critical temperature is around @xmath40 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for this temperature , the antinucleon - nucleon ratio , given by @xmath41 is negligible . </S>",
    "<S> only when the temperature gets higher , the antinucleon density starts to take significant values .    in a very interesting work @xcite , the walecka model was studied in the extreme situation in which @xmath42 . in this case , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath43 and @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> this study showed that , in this nucleon - antinucleon plasma at very high temperature , a phase transition exists . </S>",
    "<S> it is also remarkable to note that the order of the phase transition itself becomes dependent on the @xmath45 versus @xmath46 space parameter . by small changes on these parameters ( which means to change by a few percent the nuclear matter binding energy and the saturation density ) , </S>",
    "<S> the phase transition changes from first to second order . </S>",
    "<S> if we take the values of @xmath47 and @xmath48 , fitting the infinite nuclear matter binding energy as @xmath37 at a density of @xmath49 , the phase transition is of first order . </S>",
    "<S> the findings of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite may be summarized in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] .     as a function of the temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the mass is in units of the nucleon mass and the entropy , energy , and pressure are in stefan - boltzmann units.,width=264,height=226 ]    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] we see that the nucleon effective mass decreases abruptly at @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> since all other thermodynamic quantities are dependent on @xmath51 , this effect also manifests itself in energy density , pressure , and specific heat , calculated as the temperature first derivative of the energy density . </S>",
    "<S> the fast increase of the entropy is a clear signal of a first order phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> since the baryonic density is kept constant @xmath43 , the order parameter should be the entropy . </S>",
    "<S> it is a very curious constrained system , interpreted as a nucleon - antinucleon plasma @xcite .    here , </S>",
    "<S> following @xcite , we start to study the walecka model in different constrained cases . </S>",
    "<S> the main question is to understand the behavior of some thermodynamical quantities when the ratio @xmath52 varies . </S>",
    "<S> now , all quantities will have contribution from the baryonic density , contrary to fig . [ fig1 ] where @xmath43 .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now remark that we have fixed numerically the ratio within a precision of one part in a thousand . </S>",
    "<S> it means that the set of equations ( 1 - 7 ) is solved self - consistently with @xmath53 . in figure [ fig2 ] </S>",
    "<S> we present @xmath54 as a function of the temperature for different values of @xmath55 .    . </S>",
    "<S> from the left to the right : @xmath56.,width=264,height=226 ]    for the same values of @xmath55 investigated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] , the entropy behavior as a function of the temperature is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ]    . </S>",
    "<S> the values of @xmath55 are the same of figure [ fig2].,width=264,height=226 ]    both the nucleon effective mass and the entropy follow the same abrupt decreasing ( increasing ) behavior one sees for the particular case @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> from these figures we see that , as the ratio @xmath58 decreases , the temperature in which an abrupt behavior arises also decreases , but keeping the same character . in principle </S>",
    "<S> , there is an important difference between the system described by fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] and those of figs . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] . in the first , @xmath57 and @xmath43 along the temperature variation . in the second , </S>",
    "<S> the ratios are kept constant while @xmath59 varies . </S>",
    "<S> visually , figs . </S>",
    "<S> 2 - 3 suggest phase coexistence at some temperature range . according to the gibbs criteria , </S>",
    "<S> if one has phases @xmath60 and @xmath61 , a phase coexistence arises when @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> the critical temperature is achieved when , above that , no more phase coexistence is possible . for the case </S>",
    "<S> @xmath57 , a phase coexistence exists at @xmath65 and @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> it means that , if the temperature increases or decreases from this value , the phase coexistence disappears as we can see in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] , where the minima of the thermodynamical potential have different values for the same temperature .     </S>",
    "<S> ( @xmath57).,width=264,height=226 ]    this kind of investigation was performed , for example , by asakawa and yazaki @xcite when working with the njl model at finite temperature , where a phase transition is also present . </S>",
    "<S> following their procedure , we can verify whether the system exhibits phase coexistence or not .    </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , despite the signals of phase coexistence shown by figs . [ fig2]-[fig3 ] , we did not find phase coexistence for a single value of @xmath55 when @xmath67 . in this case , when the system was in thermal ( @xmath68 ) and mechanical ( @xmath69 ) equilibrium , chemical equilibrium ( @xmath70 ) was not found . on the other hand , along the apparent phase coexistence region signalized in figs . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]-[fig3 ] by three different values of @xmath71 and entropy for the same temperature , we found a stable phase ( global minimum of the thermodynamical potential ) . </S>",
    "<S> it indicates the presence of stable phases up to the start of the backbending of the curves , and new stable phases by any increase of the temperature , but with a dramatic decrease ( increase ) in the effective mass ( entropy ) . </S>",
    "<S> such a phase transition without phase coexistence is rare in physics . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we decided to leave the fixed ratio scenario to analyse what happens if the system becomes free of such constraint .    </S>",
    "<S> next , we proceed to investigate the phase coexistence in the walecka model still at high temperature but without any fixed @xmath72 constraint . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5 ] we display the thermodynamical potential density @xmath73 and f(@xmath71 ) given by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ pressure ] ) and eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ gap ] ) respectively .     </S>",
    "<S> ( upper curve in top panel ) and @xmath74 ( lower curve in botton panel ) . </S>",
    "<S> the values of @xmath31 are those that make the two minima to be have the same value for each temperature . </S>",
    "<S> note that , now , @xmath55 is not constrained and have a different value for each temperature and chemical potential.,width=264,height=226 ]    in the curves presented , the gibbs criteria @xmath68 , @xmath69 ) and @xmath70 are clearly satisfied . as we continue to decrease the temperature , the gibbs criteria can be fulfilled since the chemical potential @xmath0 increases . </S>",
    "<S> the curves for the thermodynamical potential for @xmath75 ( not shown ) becomes flatter as the temperature decreases . </S>",
    "<S> this happens until @xmath76 and @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the coexistence region for the walecka model , with the coupling constants given previously and without any @xmath55 constraint , is @xmath78 with @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> the phase diagram @xmath80 is given in fig . [ fig6 ] .        </S>",
    "<S> now , we have the values of @xmath71 which allow the phase coexistence for the phase diagram of fig . [ fig6 ] . with these </S>",
    "<S> , we can extract the net baryon densities @xmath8 as a function of @xmath81 which allows phase coexistence . </S>",
    "<S> the results are presented in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig7 ] .        </S>",
    "<S> following the same procedure , in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig8 ] we show the different ratios @xmath72 for which the system affords coexistence . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to observe that no coexistence exists if one of the ratio is not greater than @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> as we can see , only in the particular case @xmath83 , which corresponds to @xmath84 , there is a phase coexistence allowing only one fixed ratio .    ) versus temperature for the phase coexistence region.,width=264,height=226 ]    in short , we start by studying the walecka model at high temperature regime constraining the anti - nucleon - nucleon ratio ( @xmath55 ) to be constant but not equal to one as has been done by theis et al . @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have seen that the visual signals of phase transition for the effective nucleon mass ( @xmath85 ) and entropy ( @xmath6 ) versus temperature ( @xmath86 ) for the cases @xmath87 are tipically the same of those obtained in the case @xmath57 . by this </S>",
    "<S> we mean an abrupt decrease ( increase ) of both ( @xmath85 and @xmath6 ) for @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , however , we could not find for @xmath87 , contrary to the @xmath57 case , a phase coexistence signature by using the gibbs criteria . </S>",
    "<S> phase transition without phase coexistence is rare to occur in physics . as far as we know , they are theoretically predicted for the anomalous two - dimension kosterlitz - thouless phase transition @xcite , as an example . </S>",
    "<S> since we could not find a clear signature for phase coexistence at fixed @xmath89 we have investigated phase coexistence for non - constrained values of @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> our study shows that the only phase coexistence regime for a fixed @xmath55 occurs at @xmath57 or , what is the same , @xmath90 . in the the walecka model parametrization </S>",
    "<S> we have used , coexistence phases occur approximately in the interval @xmath91 and different values of @xmath55 at each phase are needed .    </S>",
    "<S> if one uses hadronic models @xcite to study high energy heavy - ion collisions , the models face low density and high temperature regime . in the chemical freeze - out , anti - nucleon - nucleon </S>",
    "<S> are produced at ratios which depends on the center - of - mass energy @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although the walecka model is to simple to deal with , it may anticipate roughly what can happen with more realistic hadronic models . </S>",
    "<S> theis et al @xcite analysed ( @xmath92 ) that , depending on its parametrization , the walecka model shows first or second order phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> the same happens with different hadronic models @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is to be expected that models ( with @xmath92 ) which present first order phase transition would follow a behavior similar to the walecka model ( figs . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig6 ] -[fig8 ] ) regarding phase coexistence regions . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , depending on the values of @xmath86 and @xmath93 used to fit the freeze - out data , the chosen hadronic model may be dealing with hadronic phase coexistence region , as depicted in figures [ fig6]-[fig8 ] . </S>"
