    "it has been believed that hadron matter changes to quark matter at high - density region by way of the `` deconfinement phase transition '' .",
    "unfortunately the deconfinement phase transition have not been well understood up to now , and many authors have studied it by model calculations or by first - principle calculations like lattice qcd .",
    "these studies are now developing , and many exciting results have been reported .",
    "properties of quark matter have been actively studied theoretically in quark - gluon plasma , color superconductivity @xcite or magnetism @xcite , and experimentally in relativistic heavy - ion collision ( rhic ) , hera or early universe and compact stars @xcite .",
    "when we calculate uniform hadron matter ( nuclear matter ) and quark matter at zero temperature separately , by using the mit bag model , we can expect the first - order phase transition as seen in figs .",
    "[ eosbulk ] and [ omebulk ] .",
    "we can see that quark matter is an energetically favorable state at high - density region , @xmath3 ( fig .",
    "[ eosbulk ] ) . as we can see in fig .",
    "[ omebulk ] , the thermodynamic potential of quark matter becomes lower at higher baryon - number chemical potential .",
    "these results suggest the deconfinement phase transition at high densities .",
    "the features of the deconfinement phase transition have not been fully elucidated yet .",
    "we assume here that it is the first order phase transition , and use the bag model for simplicity",
    ". then the thermodynamically forbidden region appears in the equation of state ( eos ) and we can expect the mixed phase , the hadron - quark mixed phase , in some density region , which may exist in inner core region of neutron stars and during the hadronization of high - temperature quark - gluon plasma at rhic experiment .",
    "we have to apply the gibbs conditions ( gc ) to get eos in thermodynamic equilibrium : gc demand chemical equilibrium , pressure valance and thermal equilibrium between two phases ; @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are baryon - number and charge chemical potentials , respectively .",
    "thermal equilibrium is implicitly achieved at @xmath7 .",
    "note that there are two independent chemical potentials in this phase transition .",
    "in such a case the system should be much different from the liquid - vapor phase transition which is described by only one chemical potential .     of uniform hadron matter and quark matter as a function of baryon chemical potential @xmath8 .",

    "uniform quark matter is energetically favorable in high @xmath8 region while hadron matter in low @xmath8 region.,width=302 ]    these gc must be fulfilled in the hadron - quark mixed phase . on the other hand",
    ", the maxwell construction ( mc ) may be very familiar and has been used by many authors to get eos for the first order phase transitions @xcite .",
    "it is well known that mc is a correct prescription to derive eos for the liquid - vapor phase transition . however , glendenning @xcite pointed out that mc is not appropriate for the hadron - quark mixed phase : one of gc about the charge chemical equilibrium , @xmath9 , is not satisfied in mc , since the local charge neutrality is implicitly assumed without imposing this condition .",
    "he emphasized that the local charge neutrality is too restrictive and each hadron or quark phase may have a net charge because only the total charge must be kept neutral .",
    "when we use gc in the bulk calculation , which we explain in detail later , we can see the mixed phase appears in a large density region .",
    "the pressure is not constant as density changes in the mixed phase , while only a constant pressure is obtained from mc as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite .    however , the bulk calculation is too simple and heiselberg et al .",
    "@xcite claimed the importance of including the finite - size effects , i.e. , the surface tension at the hadron - quark boundary and the coulomb interaction energy .",
    "they studied the quark droplet immersed in hadron matter and found that it is energetically unfavorable if the surface tension is large enough . on the contrary , however , if the surface tension is not large the mixed phase can exist in some density region .",
    "glendenning and pei @xcite suggested the crystalline structure by a bulk calculation using the small surface tension : one phase is immersed in another phase with various geometrical structures ; `` droplet '' , `` rod '' , `` slab '' , `` tube '' , and `` bubble '' . these are called the structured mixed phases ( smp ) . applying the results based on the bulk calculation to neutron stars",
    ", they suggested that there could develop smp in the core region for several kilo meters in thickness .",
    "r120 mm     at a first glance , this view seems to be reasonable and there may appear the mixed phase in a large density region . however , there are still many points to be elucidated about the finite - size effects .",
    "voskresensky et al .",
    "emphasized that the proper treatment of the coulomb interaction is important in the mixed phase @xcite .",
    "first note that there is the relation between chemical potential and the coulomb potential by way of the gauge transformation : chemical potential is not well defined before the gauge fixing .",
    "secondly , the charge chemical equilibrium could be rather satisfied even in mc , once the coulomb potential @xmath10 is incorporated : @xmath11 whereas @xmath12 note that the electron chemical potential @xmath13 and the electron number density can be expressed in terms of the combination , @xmath14 ( see eq .  ( 48 ) ) , when the coulomb potential @xmath15 is introduced .",
    "therefore , eqs .",
    "( [ mc1 ] ) , ( [ mc2 ] ) mean that the charge chemical potential is equal , while the electron number is different between the hadron and quark phases .",
    "equation ( [ mc2 ] ) is reduced to @xmath16 in the absence of the coulomb potential , which is the previous claim that the charge chemical equilibrium is apparently violated in mc .",
    "thus we can see that the previous claim means nothing but the difference of the electron number in two phases @xcite .",
    "thirdly , it is important to take into account the coulomb screening effect .",
    "we have to solve the poisson equation consistently with other equations of motion for charged particles .",
    "actually , voskresensky et al .   showed smp is mechanically unstable by the coulomb screening effect when the surface tension is not small .",
    "if smp is mechanically unstable , the phase transition should be similar to that in mc .",
    "it can be easily seen that there should occur rearrangement of charged particle densities by the coulomb interaction . on the contrary",
    "such rearrangement modifies the coulomb potential . as a result",
    "the poisson equation becomes highly non - linear and difficult to solve analytically . in their study , a linear approximation ( rpa ) was employed to solve the poisson equation analytically .",
    "it is valid to use the approximation for pointing out the important property of smp , but it may be conceivable that various charge properties like `` global charge neutrality '' for gc , `` local charge neutrality '' for mc , and `` the coulomb screening effect '' have important roles in the mixed phase . therefore ,",
    "solving the poisson equation without any approximation is of much significance .",
    "we have reported a preliminary result for the case of droplet @xcite",
    ". it would be also very interesting to derive eos in our consistent calculation for the hadron - quark matter phase transition .",
    "now we consider two infinite matters separated by a sharp boundary : uniform quark matter and hadron matter .",
    "we consider the quark phase consists of u , d , s quarks and electron , and the hadron phase proton , neutron and electron .",
    "we discard the coulomb interaction in the calculation",
    ". then we can evaluate the total thermodynamic potential @xmath17 : @xmath18 the explicit expressions of @xmath19 for non - uniform matter are given in the next section .",
    "we use them by replacing the space dependent quantities by constants for each uniform matter .    introducing the volume fraction of the quark phase @xmath20",
    ", we impose the global charge neutrality : the total charge density vanishes , @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the net charge densities of the quark and hadron phases , respectively , @xmath24    note that we have now six chemical potentials ; @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "we first consider @xmath31 equilibrium in each phase and chemical equilibrium at the hadron - quark boundary .",
    "thus all chemical potentials are constant .",
    "the chemical equilibrium conditions then are : @xmath32 in the quark phase , @xmath33 in the hadron phase , and @xmath34 at the hadron - quark interface .",
    "the last condition ( [ chemeqp ] ) can be derived from other four conditions , so that there are left four independent conditions for chemical equilibrium .",
    "therefore , if we give two chemical potentials @xmath8 and @xmath30 by hand , we can determine these four chemical potentials ; @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 from these four equations .",
    "next , we can determine @xmath30 by the global charge neutrality condition ( [ totchcond ] ) .",
    "@xmath20 is still unknown at this point and finally , we find the optimal value of @xmath20 by using one of gc ; @xmath35 , where pressure @xmath36 is given by the thermodynamic relation : @xmath37 .",
    "thus once @xmath8 is given , all other values @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) and @xmath20 can be obtained .",
    "we show the results of the bulk calculation .",
    "we present the charge densities in fig .",
    "[ chdens ] .",
    "we can see the total charge density is zero , while the quark phase is negatively charged and the hadron phase positively charged .",
    "note that mc always gives a null charge density in each phase due to the local charge neutrality @xcite .",
    "r80 mm     figure [ presbulk ] shows pressure versus baryon - number density .",
    "the most important difference between `` maxwell '' and `` bulk gibbs '' is that the pressure given by mc is constant while that given by the bulk calculation with gc is density dependent .",
    "remember that the outstanding feature in these two results comes from that each hadron or quark phase has a net charge in `` bulk gibbs '' , while each phase is neutral in `` maxwell '' .",
    "the phase diagram in the @xmath40 plane is presented in fig .",
    "[ mubmuebulk ] .",
    "we can easily see that the charge chemical potential @xmath41 is much different between uniform hadron matter and quark matter for mc , which means chemical equilibrium condition for @xmath41 is not satisfied in mc .",
    "thus it could be said that mc is not a proper way in the bulk calculation .",
    "glendenning @xcite pointed out this defect in mc and showed another result ( bulk gibbs ) within the bulk calculation .",
    "one can easily see that the mixed phase appears in a wide @xmath8 region in fig .",

    "width=302 ]    , width=302 ]    after the claim by glendenning , heiselberg et al .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the finite - size effects may disfavor the mixed phase by extending the bulk calculation to include the coulomb interaction and the surface energy . on the other hand , glendenning and",
    "pei @xcite suggested `` crystalline structures of the mixed phase '' because smp are energetically more favorable than uniform matter even including the surface and coulomb effects .",
    "voskresensky et al",
    ".  pointed out the importance of the coulomb screening effect and suggested the usefulness of mc for the mixed phase .",
    "we have seen mc is apparently incorrect because if we apply mc to this mixed phase , one of gc , charge chemical equilibrium , is violated . however , once the coulomb interaction is taken into account , there is still a room to satisfy the condition without spoiling the picture given by mc , as noted in the previous section . since",
    "the coulomb screening effect had been taken into account with an approximation in their study , we may still address a question , `` is the picture derived from mc is completely meaningless when we include the coulomb interaction in a proper way ? '' .",
    "all we have to do next is to solve the poisson equation without any approximation , strictly satisfying gc .",
    "we use the idea of the density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite to study the quark - hadron mixed phase .",
    "we employ here the thomas - fermi approximation , which gives the simple expressions for the energies .",

    "one important point we would like to address here is , when there is the coulomb interaction , the gauge variance of chemical potentials should be taken into account .",

    "if @xmath136 is positive , the mixed phase is an unfavorable state . in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ omedef ] , the point given by the maxwell construction is specified by a circle ( @xmath138 mev , @xmath139 ) , where the following relations are maintained , @xmath140 note that if we naively apply mc , we have to discard one of gc , @xmath141 in the absence of the coulomb potential .",
    "the curve of `` bulk gibbs '' shows that the mixed phase is energetically favorable in the wide @xmath8 region , as is already seen in sec .  2 .",
    "the difference @xmath136 for `` bulk gibbs '' is up to 10 mev/@xmath142 , while for the droplet phase ( @xmath135 mev / fm@xmath1 ) , it is only less than 2 mev/@xmath142 .",
    "this shows that if we use the larger value of the surface tension , the mixed phase gets more unfavorable .",
    "this feature is similar to that reported by heiselberg @xcite or alford @xcite .",
    "we can see the region of the energetically favorable mixed phase in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ omedef ] : the region becomes narrower than `` bulk gibbs '' , which means that the property of the mixed phase is closer to that given by mc .",
    "thus we have seen that the mixed phase is very much affected by the coulomb screening effect and the surface effect , by strictly keeping gc . for the larger value of the surface tension , mc is effectively useful in the description of the hadron - quark mixed phase .",
    "note that we never violate the condition for the charge chemical equilibrium @xmath143 to get these conclusions .",
    "remember that the meaning of the condition in the presence of the coulomb potential is different from that in the absence of the coulomb potential .",
    "in this note we have first seen how the bulk calculation is performed for the hadron - quark mixed phase by applying the gibbs conditions to the system consisting of two infinite matters .",
    "it gives a wide density region for the mixed phase .",
    "based on this result , some authors also suggested the structured mixed phase with various geometrical structures , by including the finite - size effects , the surface and coulomb energies @xcite .",
    "we have examined the finite - size effects in the mixed phase by numerically solving the equations of motion for the particle densities and the poisson equation for the coulomb potential .",
    "our framework is based on the idea of the density functional theory , which , we believe , is one of the best theories to treat the structured mixed phases .",
    "we have demonstrated , by taking the droplet phase as an example , that the coulomb screening effect and rearrangement of the charge densities play an important role for the mechanical instability as well as the energy of the mixed phase . as a result",
    "we have seen that the region of the mixed phase is highly restricted by the coulomb screening effect as well as the surface energy .",
    "we have also seen that eos gives the similar behavior to that given by the maxwell construction , whereas the maxwell construction is apparently incorrect in a system with more than one chemical potential : the maxwell construction is effectively useful in the description of the mixed phase , even in this case . as another case of more than one chemical potential ,",
    "kaon condensation has been also studied @xcite and the result is similar to the present case .",
    "we have included the surface tension , but its definite value is not clear and many authors treated it as a free parameter .",
    "there are also many estimations for the surface tension at the hadron - quark interface in lattice qcd @xcite , in shell - model calculations @xcite and in model calculations based on the dual - ginzburg landau theory @xcite .",
    "if we have the realistic value of the surface tension , we can reasonably bring out smp in the hadron - quark phase transition . as these system corresponds to neutron star matter",
    ", we have seen that the mixed phase should be narrow by the finite - size effects .",
    "our result would restrict the allowed smp region in neutron stars which is suggested by glendenning @xcite .",
    "it could be said that they should change the property of neutron stars especially in equation of state @xcite .",
    "we have assumed in relation to phenomenological implications here that temperature is zero .",
    "it would be much interesting to include the finite - temperature effect .",
    "then it is possible to draw the phase diagram in the @xmath144 plane and we can study the properties of the deconfinement phase transition . in this study",
    "we have used a simple model for quark matter to figure out the finite - size effects in the structured mixed phase .",
    "however , it has been suggested that the color superconductivity is a ground state of quark matter @xcite . to get more realistic picture of the hadron - quark phase transition",
