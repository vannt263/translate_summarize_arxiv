    "the astronomical and cosmological observations predict that we live in an expanding universe . after the discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) @xcite , the big - bang cosmology has become the standard model for cosmology which has a beginning of the universe at some finite past .",
    "it is found that the big - bang cosmology does face some problems in addressing issues of the observed universe both in the early and late universe .",
    "a number of problems , namely , horizon problem , flatness problem , singularity problem etc .",
    "crop up when one probes the early universe in the framework of the big - bang model .",
    "these problems however can be resolved by evoking a phase of inflation @xcite at a very early epoch .",
    "furthermore , it is known that the large scale structure formation of the universe can be addressed in this scenario successfully . on the other hand ,",
    "very recent observations predict that our universe is passing through a phase of acceleration @xcite .",
    "this phase of acceleration is believed to be a late time phase of the universe and may be accommodated in the standard model by adding a positive cosmological constant in the einstein s field equation .    in spite of its overwhelming success",
    ", modern big - bang cosmology still has some unresolved issues .",
    "the physics of the inflation and the introduction of a small cosmological constant for late time acceleration are not completely understood @xcite in details . moreover , various competing models exist that are as yet not fully distinguished empirically from the currently available observational data .",
    "this is why there is enough motivation to search for an alternative cosmological model . in this context , ellis and",
    "maartens @xcite considered the possibility of a cosmological model @xcite in which there is no big - bang singularity , no beginning of time , and the universe effectively get rid of a quantum regime for space - time by staying large at all times .",
    "the universe started out in the infinite past in an almost static einstein universe , and subsequently , it entered in an expanding phase slowly , eventually evolving into a hot big - bang era .",
    "later ellis , murugan and tsagas @xcite constructed an emergent universe scenario for a closed universe with a minimally coupled scalar field @xmath0 , which has a special form for the interaction potential @xmath1 .",
    "it was pointed out later @xcite that the potential is similar to what one obtains from a modified gravitational action with a polynomial lagrangian @xmath2 after a suitable conformal transformation and identifying the field as @xmath3 with a negative @xmath4 .    the eu scenario merits attention , as it promises to solve several conceptual as well as technical issues of the big - bang model .",
    "a notable direction is regarding the cosmological constant problem @xcite .",
    "@xcite obtained an emergent universe in the framework of general theory of relativity in a flat universe with a nonlinear equation of state of the form @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are arbitrary constants .",
    "such potentials have been also studied in the context of modified chaplygin gas models @xcite .",
    "a spatially flat universe is most likely as predicted from recent cosmological and astronomical observations .",
    "such an emergent universe scenario can be realized also in a modified theory of gravitation @xcite by including a gauss - bonnet term in the presence of dilaton coupling @xcite , brane world gravity @xcite , brans - dicke theory @xcite , the non - linear sigma model @xcite , chiral cosmological fields in einstein gauss - bonnet gravity @xcite , dark sector fields in a chiral cosmological model @xcite and exact global phantonical solution @xcite .",
    "emergent universe accommodates a late time de - sitter phase and thus it naturally leads to the late time acceleration of the universe , as well .",
    "such a scenario is promising from the perspective of offering unified early as well as late time dynamics of the universe @xcite .",
    "note , however , that the focal point of unification in such emergent universe models lies in the choice of the equation of state for the polytropic fluid , while several other models of unification rely more on the scalar field dynamics through choice of field potentials @xcite .    the emergent model proposed by mukherjee _",
    "_ @xcite in which a polytropic equation of state ( henceforth , eos ) is used , gives rise to a universe with a composition of three different types of fluids determined by the parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 . in the original emergent universe model proposed by mukherjee _",
    "@xcite , it was assumed non - interacting fluids and each of the three types of fluids identified satisfy conservation equations separately . recently using the observational prediction of wmap7 @xcite and planck2013 @xcite the permitted range of values of the parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 are determined @xcite .",
    "the recent cosmological observations from planck2013 impose tight bounds on the eos parameters in an emergent universe ( eu ) @xcite . for a viable cosmological scenario ,",
    "it is further necessary to consider a consistent model of the universe which contains radiation dominated , matter dominated and subsequently the late accelerated phases of the universe . in the original eu model it is shown @xcite that the composition of the universe is fixed once @xmath6 is fixed .",
    "a problem thus arises as to how a pressureless matter component could be accommodated within such a scenario .",
    "however , allowing interaction among the constituent fluids of the emergent universe may open up richer physical consequences .",
    "interacting fluid cosmological models have been previously considered in the literature , and among a variety of reasons and motivations for such models , analyses of interactions within the dark sector are quite popular @xcite . in the present context interaction among the constituent fluids",
    "is useful to obtain a consistent evolutionary scenario of the universe .",
    "another important consistency condition is imposed through the thermodynamics of an expanding universe .",
    "there has been a lot of recent interest in the study of the connection between thermodynamics and gravitational dynamics in the presence of horizons @xcite .",
    "another aspect the hawking temperature of the apparent horizon in a frw universe was determined by cai _",
    "indeed , einstein s equations have been interpreted as a thermodynamical relation resulting from the displacement of the horizon .",
    "since the emergent universe scenario entails a phase of accelerated expansion , it is relevant here to study the status of the second law of thermodynamics in the picture involving interacting fluids in the emergent universe .    with the above motivations , in the present paper we consider two different cases in the emergent universe scenario : ( i ) a two - fluid model with interaction of the fluid having the non - linear eos given by eq .",
    "( 1 ) with another barotropic fluid , beginning at some time @xmath8 ( model - i ) and ( ii ) a three - fluid model with interaction among the various constituent fluids with different individual equations of state , starting at a time @xmath9 ( model - ii ) . the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "2 we set up the field equation for emergent universe in the general theory of relativity , and obtain cosmological solutions . in sec .",
    "3 we consider the above two cases , model - i and model - ii . we show that generation of pressureless matter fluids is possible within the emergent universe scenario . in sec . 4",
    ", we demonstrate the consistency of the emergent universe scenario with interacting fluids with the generalized second law of thermodynamics . finally , we make some concluding remarks in sec .",
    "the einstein field equation is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 represent the ricci tensor , ricci scalar , metric tensor , matter - energy tensor and newton s gravitational constant .",
    "here we consider four dimensions for which @xmath16 runs from ( 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 ) .",
    "we consider a flat robertson - walker metric which is given by @xmath17 \\label{a1}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 represents the scale factor of the universe .",
    "we consider the energy momentum tensor as @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the energy density and @xmath21 is the pressure .",
    "using the flat robertson - walker metric given by eq . ( 3 ) in the einstein s field equation one obtains @xmath22 @xmath23\\ ] ] where we set @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the conservation equation is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 represents the hubble parameter .",
    "as mentioned earlier , mukherjee _ et al . _",
    "@xcite obtained an emergent universe scenario with a polytropic equation of state ( henceforth , eos ) given by @xmath28 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are arbitrary constants . making use of the conservation equation and the eos given by eqs .",
    "( 4 ) and ( 5 ) in eq . ( 7 ) , one obtains a second order differential equation given by @xmath29 the scale factor of the universe is thus obtained integrating eq .",
    "( 8) which is given by @xmath30^{\\frac{2}{3(a+1)}}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the two integration constants .",
    "it is interesting to note that @xmath33 leads to a contracting universe whereas with @xmath34 and @xmath35 leads to a non - singular solution which is expanding .",
    "the later solution corresponds to an emergent universe which was obtained by mukherjee _ et .",
    "the energy density of the universe in terms of scale factor is obtained from eq .",
    "( 6 ) making use of eos given by eq .",
    "( 7 ) which is given by @xmath36 expanding the above expression , one obtains energy density as the sum of three terms which can be identified with three different types of fluids .",
    "thus , the components of energy density and pressure can be expressed as follows : @xmath37 where we denote @xmath38 @xmath39 comparing with the barotropic eos given by @xmath40 one obtains @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "thus , the parameter @xmath6 plays an important role in determining the composition of the fluids in the universe .",
    "for example , @xmath44 leads to a universe with radiation , exotic matter and dark energy , @xmath45 leads to dark energy , exotic matter and dust .",
    "thus once the eos parameter @xmath6 is fixed the composition of the fluid in the universe gets determined . in order to obtain a viable scenario of the universe we consider interacting fluids model in the next section",
    "so that a transformation of one kind fluid in the later epoch gives rise to the composition of matter that we observe today .",
    "in this section we consider two different models of interacting fluids in an eu scenario .    in this case , we consider two interacting fluids with densities @xmath20 and @xmath46 respectively which can exchange energies with each other .",
    "one of the fluid with energy density , say @xmath20 is dominated to begin with satisfying a non - linear eos given by eq .",
    "( 1 ) which leads to an emergent universe model as discussed above with no interaction .",
    "the contribution of the other fluid in the energy density of the universe is assumed to be important at a later epoch .",
    "the corresponding pressure of the former fluid is given by @xmath47 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are constants .",
    "the other fluid satisfies a barotropic equation of state which is given by @xmath48 where @xmath49 corresponds to eos parameter .",
    "the hubble parameter @xmath50 evolves according to the friedmann equation which is given by @xmath51 in this case we consider a cosmological model where exchange of energy between two different fluids is allowed.the are many astrophysical and cosmological motivations for considering energy exchanges between the various components of the universe [ 39 - 44 ] .",
    "different phenomenological considerations dictate the onset of such interactions .",
    "for example , in various scalar field models of dark energy , such as in quintessence , or k - essence , there arise phase transitions during particular eras resulting in decay of the cosmological vacuum energy , as well as particle production .",
    "similarly , there could be other cases of energy exchange , such as due to the evolution of a population of primordial black holes whose evaporation time depends on the particular formation mechanism or formation era . in the present paper , without assuming any specific mechanism for energy exchange , we assume that the interaction starts at some particular time @xmath52 . the two interacting fluids respect a total energy conservation equation and their densities evolve with time as @xmath53 @xmath54 where @xmath4 represents a coupling parametrizing the energy exchange between the fluids .",
    "one may view the above interaction as a flow of energy from first kind of fluid to the second one ( say , dark matter ) beginning at the epoch considered here .",
    "now , using eq .",
    "( 14 ) in eq .",
    "( 17 ) , we get a first order differential equation which can be integrated to obtain the behaviour of energy density in terms of the scale factor of the universe and the interaction coupling factor .",
    "thus the energy density and pressure for the fluid of the first kind are given by @xmath55 @xmath56 if the interaction is with a pressureless dark fluid _",
    "i.e. , _ @xmath57 ( however , @xmath58 ) , eq . ( 18 ) can be integrated using eqs .",
    "( 16 ) and ( 19 ) which determine the total energy density and pressure as follows : @xmath59 @xmath60 the equation of state parameter for the second fluid is given by @xmath61 in the limiting case as @xmath62 , we get @xmath63 . an interesting case emerges when the coupling parameter @xmath64 and @xmath65 . in this case a universe with dark energy , exotic matter and radiation to begin with ( i.e. , before the interaction sets in ) made a transition to a matter dominated phase .",
    "thus , an emergent universe with radiation , dark energy ( component that is subdominant at early times ) and exotic matter ( for @xmath44 ) to begin with transits to a universe with matter domination phase after an epoch after @xmath66 for the interaction coupling strength @xmath64 .",
    "hence , a consistent scenario of the observed universe in the eu model may be realized in this case .",
    "the original eu model was obtained in the presence of non - interacting fluids permitted by the parameter @xmath6 in a flat universe case .",
    "the corresponding densities and pressures are given by eqs .",
    "( [ r1 ] ) and ( [ r2 ] ) respectively . for non - interacting fluids ,",
    "the eos parameters for the three fluids permitted above are given by @xmath67 for @xmath68 , it accommodates dark energy , exotic matter and the usual barotropic fluid . the energy density and pressure of the exotic matter and that of the barotropic fluids decreases with the expansion of the universe",
    "however , the rate of decrease is different evident from eqs .",
    "( [ r1 ] ) and ( [ r2 ] ) .",
    "we assume an interaction among the components of the fluid in the universe which is assumed to be originated at a later epoch ( such interactions could arise due to a variety of mechanisms @xcite ) .",
    "assuming onset of interaction among the composition of the fluid at @xmath69 , the conservation equations for the energy densities of the fluids now can be written as @xmath70 @xmath71 @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 represent the interaction terms , which can have arbitrary form , @xmath75 represents dark energy density , @xmath76 represents exotic matter and @xmath77 represents normal matter . in this case",
    "@xmath78 corresponds to energy transfer from exotic matter sector to two other constituents , @xmath79 corresponds to energy transfer from dark energy sector to the other two fluids , and @xmath80 corresponds to energy loss for the normal matter sector .",
    "the case @xmath81 corresponds to the limiting case where dark energy interacts only with the exotic matter .",
    "it is important to see that although the three equations are different the total energy of the fluid satisfies the conservation equation together .",
    "it is possible to construct the equivalent effective uncoupled model , described by the following conservation equations : @xmath82 @xmath83 @xmath84 where the effective equation of state parameters are given below : @xmath85 @xmath86 @xmath87 now , if we consider the interaction as @xmath88 , the effective state parameter for the normal fluid becomes @xmath89 in fig .",
    "1 we plot the variation of effective equation of state parameter @xmath90 with @xmath91 ( which corresponds to @xmath6 of the eos parameter ) for different strengths of interaction determined by @xmath92 . we note that as the strength of interaction is increased the value of @xmath91 ( _ i.e. , @xmath6 _ ) for which @xmath93 ( corresponds to matter domination ) is found to increase . thus a universe with any @xmath6 value is found to admit a matter dominated phase at a late epoch depending on the strength of the interaction which was not permitted in the absence of interaction in an eu model proposed by mukherjee _",
    "it may be pointed out here that in the very early era a universe is assumed with a composition of three different fluids having no interaction in this picture , thus the behaviour of the universe at early times remains unchanged as was found in the original eu model .",
    "thus the emergent universe scenario proposed by mukherjee _",
    "_ @xcite can be realized in the early era but at a later epoch the composition of matter changes in the present scenario from its original one with the onset of interaction .",
    "this feature represents a clear improvement over the earlier cosmological scenario in an emergent universe @xcite where it is rather difficult to accommodate a pressureless fluid .     with eos parameter @xmath6 for different interaction @xmath92 .",
    "the thick , dash , red line and green lines are for @xmath94 respectively . ]",
    "in the above analysis emergent universe models have been discussed in the presence of different types of interaction among the fluids . in the present section",
    "we investigate consistency of thermodynamic properties considering the universe as a thermodynamical system . for a flat geometry",
    "the apparent horizon coincides with the hubble horizon which is given by @xmath95 in general , the apparent horizon is a function of time .",
    "thus , a change in the apparent horizon leads to a change in volume , and consequently , the energy and entropy will change by @xmath96 and @xmath97 respectively .",
    "the energy momentum tensor before and after the change are described by the same @xmath98 , and we can consider that the pressure and the temperature remains the same @xcite .",
    "the first law of thermodynamics for the fluids considered here are given by @xmath99 @xmath100 @xmath101 where the volume of the system @xmath102 is bounded by the apparent horizon , and thus @xmath103 .",
    "hence , the rate of change of entropy for the above fluids are given by @xmath104 where @xmath105 which is obtained differentiating the equation @xmath106 and then making use of the conservation equations given by eqs .",

    "the rate of change of total entropy becomes @xmath116 , which leads to @xmath117 ^ 2 \\geq 0.\\ ] ] the non - negativity of the time rate of change of @xmath118 demonstrates the validity of the second law of thermodynamics in the context of the emergent universe model .",
    "in this paper we have investigated cosmology of the emergent universe scenario in the presence of interacting fluids . the purpose of the present analysis is to demonstrate the possibility of obtaining viable cosmological dynamics of the emergent universe .",
    "two different cosmological models have been presented here . in model",
    "i , we consider the flow of energy from the fluids required to realize the emergent universe to a pressureless fluid which sets in at an epoch @xmath8 .",
    "the density of the pressureless fluid assumes importance as matter component after the epoch @xmath52 . in model",
    "ii , we consider interactions among the three fluids of the emergent universe at time @xmath119 . before this epoch",
    "the emergent universe can be realized without an interaction among the fluids .",
    "the problem with earlier cosmological realizations of the emergent universe was that once the eos parameter @xmath6 is fixed at a given value , the universe is unable to come out of the phase with a given composition of fluids . in the present work",
    "we overcome this problem by assigning an interaction among the fluids at the epoch @xmath120 .",
    "a cosmological evolution of the observed universe through unified dynamics of associated matter and dark energy components thus becomes feasible in the emergent universe scenario . in fig .",
    "( 1 ) , we plot variation of @xmath90 with eos parameter @xmath121 for different interaction .",
    "it is evident that a early universe with a radiation dominated phase transits to a matter dominated phase with all the features observable at the present moment with the onset of interaction considered here .",
    "consistency of the interacting fluid emergent universe scenario with the generalized second law of thermodynamics is also shown .",
    "further work is needed in order for a comparative analysis of the interacting fluid emergent universe cosmology with more popular current cosmological models .",
    "detailed analysis of observational constraints pertaining to various eras of the universe are expected to yield bounds on the parameters of the emergent universe models considered here , leading to a firmer assessment of the viability of such models .",
