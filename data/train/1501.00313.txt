    ", the study of nanoparticle magnetism have elucidated many fundamental scientific phenomena , like thermally induced fluctuations , leading to magnetization reversal , known as superparamagnetism ( spm ) . the basic theory for spm",
    "was derived by nel and brown @xcite , who found that the spm relaxation time is given by an arrhenius - like expression , @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a typical attempt frequency and @xmath2 is the magnetic anisotropy barrier .",
    "( [ eq : neelbrown ] ) is supported by numerous experimental studies , see e.g. refs .  .",
    "below temperatures where the spm relaxation is important , the magnetic dynamics is dominated by a coherent uniform precession mode , which can be considered as a @xmath3 spin wave .",
    "this mode gives rise to a linear decrease of the magnetization with increasing temperature @xcite .",
    "the magnetic dynamics of antiferromagnetic ( afm ) nanoparticles has attracted much attention , because it displays much richer intrinsic dynamics than that of ferromagnetic nanoparticles @xcite , and because complications due to dipolar interactions between particles can be neglected . in afm nanoparticles with uniaxial anisotropy ,",
    "the uniform precession mode resembles a @xmath3 afm spin wave , and its frequency is influenced both by the anisotropy and by the strength of the magnetic exchange interaction @xcite .",
    "the technique of inelastic neutron scattering have earlier been found to be efficient to investigate the magnetic dynamics of nanoparticles , see _",
    "e.g. _ refs .  .",
    "in particular , in 15  nm hematite ( @xmath4-fe@xmath5o@xmath6 ) particles , the frequency of the uniform modes was found to decrease with increasing temperature .",
    "this was ascribed to anharmonicities in the uniaxial anisotropy potential @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we present neutron diffraction data on 8  nm hematite particles , which show an unexpected vanishing of static magnetic order at temperatures as low as 150  k , despite the fact that the nel temperature of bulk hematite exceeds 900  k. we analyse this result in the light of inelastic neutron data , which show a clear signal from the uniform magnetic mode at all temperatures studied ( up to 300  k ) and an increase with temperature of the uniform mode frequency .",
    "we further investigate the physics of this system by a theoretical model and by numerical simulations , and we find that they lead towards the existence of a novel dynamic  rotor  mode in afm nanoparticles .",
    "hematite is a common afm mineral occuring frequently in soils as nanoparticles .",
    "the magnetic ions in hematite are fe@xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) , which are essentially arranged in a hexagonal structure .",
    "the spins are ferromagnetically ordered in the @xmath9 planes , with alternating directions along the @xmath10 direction . in bulk hematite above the morin transition , @xmath11  k , the spins are confined to the plane by a strong planar anisotropy , while below @xmath12 , the spins turn to point along the @xmath10-axis @xcite .    in particles smaller than @xmath13  nm ,",
    "the morin transition is suppressed . at low temperatures , the spins",
    "align along an easy direction within the @xmath9 plane due to a weak axial anisotropy , presumably from the particle surface .",
    "the sublattices display a small canting from antiparallel within the plane ( in bulk  @xcite ) , due to the dzyaloshinsky - moria interaction .",
    "our simulations show that this small term has little effect on the properties we investigate , and it is generally irrelevant in the following discussion .",

    "however , this work used an effective 3d model , in which the in - plane anisotropy is neglected , leading to an overestimation of @xmath2 .",
    "assuming that the in - plane anisotropy is identical to the value for 16  nm particles @xcite , and that @xmath147the values become @xmath148  k from the neutron data and @xmath149  k from the mssbauer data . from the values of @xmath36 , we furthermore found an uncompensated moment of @xmath138 using the uniaxial model .    from the fit of the backscattering data to the nel - brown model , we find in the present work a value of the energy barrier , @xmath2 of 194(40 )  k , in agreement with the mssbauer data .",
    "in addition we obtain the prefactor value @xmath150  s.    tuning the simulations to obtain best agreement between the measured and simulated values of @xmath40 and @xmath32 , we reach a `` modeled refinement '' of the neutron data , gving @xmath135  k and @xmath138 , in very good agreement with earlier work .",
    "the simulated backscattering data using the same simulation parameters also follow the nel - brown law very closely , leading to @xmath151 , but with a slightly higher prefactor value , @xmath152  s. hence , our data and simulations show a very good internal consistency , except for the @xmath1 value . this relatively minor difference , we ascribe to anharmonicities in the anisotropy potential , not included in the simulations .",

    "the modes seem to be completely uncoupled as expected . however , our simulations with @xmath155 in our view represents closer the physical reality for a typical nanoparticle , and it is satisfying that even with this complication we are able to reproduce the experimental observations so accurately .      as a final test of the rotor model ,",

    "the experimental value of the elastic signal is in general higher than the simulations .",

    "this dominates the axial anisotropy , @xmath85 , and causes the spins to perform coherent precessions within the easy plane , hence inducing periodic reversals of @xmath143 .",
    "the frequency of the precession depends on the canting , and hence on temperature .",
    "this displaces the neutron scattering signal from ( quasi- ) elastic to inelastic , in accordance with experimental observation .",
    "we speculate that the rotor mode may be present in other nanoparticles with a strong planar anisotropy , _",
    "e.g. _ nio , although the temperature effect in this system was found to be less pronounced @xcite .",
    "we observe an increase with temperature of the mean frequency of the uniform mode in weakly interacting antiferromagnetic 8  nm hematite particles . simultaneously",
    ", we observe a disappearance of the strictly elastic signal from static magnetic order .",
    "numerical langevin simulations of a fairly detailed model is able to reproduce the features of the experimental data with sufficient accuracy . in combination with an analytical model , the simulation show that both observations can be understood by the presence of a new fast dynamical mode  the `` rotor '' mode , which can be seen as a coherent superparamagnetic relaxation . in contrast to other uniform modes in magnetic nanoparticles , the rotor mode is driven by temperature - induced canting of the sublattice spins and causes a periodic magnetisation reversal that transforms the spin system to become purely dynamical .",
    "our results are in good quantitative agreement with earlier neutron scattering and mssbauer data .",
