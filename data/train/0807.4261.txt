    "the supernova remnant ( snr ) paradigm for the origin of galactic cosmic rays heavily relies on the mechanism for particle acceleration being the _ diffusive shock acceleration _ ( dsa ) at the shock front generated in the supernova blast .",
    "this mechanism , also known as _ first order fermi acceleration _ , has been studied in great detail and a two decades long work has led to the development of a kinetic non - linear theory that allows us to assess the importance of the dynamical reaction of the accelerated particles on the shock itself .",
    "the nonlinear effects described by the theory turn out to be not just corrections .",
    "they rather reveal the profound reasons why the mechanism works in the first place as a cosmic ray accelerator : the large efficiency required to explain the energetics ( @xmath1 of the kinetic energy of the blast wave going into cosmic rays ) and the large magnetic fields required to explain the maximum energies observed in cosmic rays are the two main motivations for developing such a nonlinear theory , and , not surprisingly , are among the most successful predictions of the theory .",
    "the initial attempt at building a nonlinear theory led to two - fluid models @xcite which provided information on the dynamics and thermodynamics of the shocked gas and cosmic ray gas but not on the spectrum of the accelerated particles .",
    "a satisfactory kinetic approach , able to predict the spectrum of accelerated particles was later proposed by @xcite and @xcite . more recently",
    "a kinetic model which takes into account the possibility of arbitrary diffusion coefficients was put forward by @xcite .",
    "the self - excitation of unstable modes leading to magnetic field amplification was then also introduced by @xcite .",
    "parallel to these analytical approaches , developed primarily in the assumption of quasi - stationarity of the acceleration process , numerical approaches following the temporal evolution were also developed @xcite .",
    "these have been of crucial importance for the description of some aspects of the phenomenology connected with the acceleration process in snrs , especially during the sedov - taylor phase .",
    "numerical methods for the solution of the transport equation for cosmic rays and of the conservation equations for the plasma in the shock region have been extensively used to reproduce the observed multifrequency observations from single snrs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a typical result of all approaches to nonlinear shock acceleration is that the spectra of accelerated particles are far from being power laws .",
    "the concave shape leads to spectra as flat as @xmath2 close to the maximum momentum , corresponding to total compression factors that may exceed @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "in general the total compression factor @xmath4 is found to scale with the mach number as @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "such levels of shock modification do not compare well with some observations , which suggest @xmath0 ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    from the phenomenological point of view",
    "this problem has been faced by invoking some sort of turbulent heating : part ( or all ) of the energy in the form of alfvn waves which are responsible for the scattering of charged particles is assumed to be damped on the thermal gas , thereby causing its heating in the upstream precursor region @xcite .",
    "this process , originally investigated as a possible mechanism to limit the magnetic field amplification , keeping the turbulent field in the linear regime ( e.g. @xmath6 ) , is currently called upon also in situations in which @xmath7 .    [ tab : snr ]    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     solutions found for a shock with @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 when the turbulent heating is taken into account according to eq .

    "[ zeta ] ) .",
    "the last column shows the downstream thermal emissivity @xmath13 , normalized to the value it would have for the same shock in the test particle regime .",
    "an equation describing the alfvn heating of the precursor can be obtained by taking the derivative of the equation for the conservation of energy together with the equations of transport of waves and cosmic rays ( see the derivation of eq .  9 in * ? ? ?",
    "under the above assumptions we obtain : @xmath14=      \\zeta(\\gamma-1 ) v_a(x)u(x)^{\\gamma-1 }      \\frac{\\partial\\xi(x)}{\\partial x}\\,,\\ ] ] and @xmath15 is now the pressure of the plasma including the effects of the turbulent heating . clearly , in the limit of adiabatic evolution of the precursor , one has @xmath16 and eq .",
    "[ pgas ] is recovered .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that a good approximation to the solution of eq .",
    "[ consen ] is @xmath17\\right\\}\\,.\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the plasma pressure as calculated taking into account only adiabatic compression in the precursor , eq .",
    "this expression , which serves as an equation of state for the gas in the presence of effective alfvn heating , reduces to the standard eq .",
    "50 of @xcite for @xmath19 , while , for @xmath12 the damping of the waves is mitigated and an effective amplification of the magnetic field is allowed .",
    "the change in the equation of state of the gas also manifests itself in the shock dynamics .",
    "the new relation between the compression ratios @xmath20 and @xmath21 reads @xmath22\\,,\\ ] ] where we have introduced @xmath23\\ , , \\ ] ] with a notation which allows a direct comparison between the effects of magnetic feedback and alfvn heating .",
    "it is widely known that the inclusion of alfvn heating has an important impact on the total compression ratio , changing its scaling with the mach number from @xmath24 to @xmath25 ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however the situation is very different when the correct magnetized jump conditions are taken into account . in tab .",
    "[ tab : th ] , we report , for different values of @xmath26 , the solutions of the problem including the full treatment of growth and damping of alfvn waves according to the approximate analytical solution of eq .",
    "[ transw0k ] along with the prescription of eq .",
    "[ zeta ] , namely @xmath27\\,.\\ ] ]    it is clear that the increasing relevance of alfvn heating ( @xmath28 approaching 1 ) does not lead , in this approach , to a smoother precursor ( larger value of @xmath29 ) .",
    "in fact , the energy transfer from the waves to the plasma , while heating the plasma and reducing its compressibility , is also accompanied by a decrease of @xmath30 , the ratio of magnetic / plasma pressure .",
    "the latter is the parameter which controls the magnetic feedback , which is then reduced .",
    "the net effect is a slight increase of @xmath21 for intermediate values of @xmath31 .",
    "only if @xmath28 is very close to 1 the shock is less modified than the adiabatic solution with magnetic backreaction , but even this effect is rather limited , since the decrease of @xmath21 is only about @xmath32 for the case @xmath33 .",
    "the main effect of the inclusion of the alfvn heating is instead a significant reduction of the magnetic field ( more than a factor 10 between @xmath16 and @xmath33 ) , which also leads to a correspondingly lower @xmath34 ( @xmath35 for @xmath33 ) .",
    "we notice that the downstream temperature is affected in two different ways by the correct jump conditions and by the turbulent heating : the former provides an increase in the jump @xmath36 proportional to @xmath30 , while the latter results in a higher @xmath37 .",
    "the interplay between the two effects produces the non - monotonic trend of @xmath38 and of the thermal emissivity @xmath13 ( shown in the last columns of tab .",
    "[ tab : th ] ) .",
    "the latter is slightly increased by the presence of non - adiabatic heating , with a value around 0.5@xmath39 , basically for all choices of @xmath40 .",
    "a recent investigation on the role of turbulent heating on the properties of cosmic ray modified shocks has been carried out by @xcite .",
    "these authors adopt a different recipe for particle injection into the acceleration process ( which is a poorly understood issue in any case ) , that leads to a dependence of the fraction of injected particles on the temperature immediately upstream of the shock . as a consequence",
    "they find that dissipation of magnetic turbulence into heat upstream of the shock boosts the injection by a large factor and modifies the cosmic ray spectrum at low energies , although it does not significantly affect the overall acceleration efficiency and the high energy part of the spectrum unless the the fraction of turbulence energy that is transferred to heat gets close to 100% .",
    "if the latter is the case , on the contrary , also @xcite observe a considerable decrease of both the magnetic field strength and @xmath41 , in agreement with our results .    before concluding this section",
    ", we summarize our main conclusions concerning the effects of turbulent heating :    * if turbulent heating is in the form of nonlinear landau damping , it is suppressed for @xmath42 @xcite , thus it could be important only if the circumstellar temperature is rather high ( for instance because the shock is expanding in the pre - supernova stellar wind , or because of a dominance of the hot coronal gas phase ) and the shock has already slowed down significantly ; * if the rate of damping of the waves is too close to that of growth ( @xmath43 ) , the magnetic field amplification is heavily suppressed and explaining the large levels of magnetization inferred from x - ray observations becomes very challenging ; * if the damping is effective but still allowing sufficient magnetic field amplification , the smoothening of the precursor is roughly unchanged with respect to the results obtained in the case of magnetic feedback alone .",
    "the possibility that the narrow filaments detected in x - rays may result from severe synchrotron losses of high energy electrons has sparked much attention on the issue of magnetic field amplification at shock fronts , since the inferred fields are @xmath44 times larger than the typical interstellar ones .",
    "the importance of such magnetic fields for the origin of cosmic rays is immediate : if the turbulent field leads to bohm diffusion , it is easy to show that particle acceleration at shock fronts may lead to the generation of protons with energy close to the knee .    in a previous paper @xcite we investigated the hydrodynamical consequences of having a large magnetic field amplified by cosmic ray streaming upstream of the shock and we demonstrated that when the magnetic pressure equals or overcomes the pressure of the background plasma , a condition easy to realize , the compressibility of the plasma is reduced , so to decrease the compression factor of the cosmic ray modified shock and smoothen its precursor .    in the present paper we went beyond the hydrodynamical picture and we solved the combined system of conservation equations , cosmic ray diffusion - convection equation , and equation for the magnetic field amplification in order to investigate the effects of the precursor smoothening on the spectrum of accelerated particles .",
    "we find that resonant streaming instability is sufficient to amplify a parallel pre - existing magnetic field to levels which compare well with x - ray observations , if the latter are interpreted as a result of strong synchrotron losses .    in these circumstances",
    ", we also confirm the crucial role of the dynamical feedback of the magnetic field , which leads to total compression factors around @xmath45 ( to be compared with the typical predictions of standard nldsa , which gives @xmath46 ) , in good agreement with the values suggested by observations and by fits to the multifrequency spectrum of several snrs @xcite .",
    "the reduced compression in the precursor does not inhibit particle acceleration , in fact a fraction 50 - 60% of the ram pressure at the shock is converted into accelerated particles , for parameters typical of a snr in the sedov phase .",
    "the kinetic calculation of particle acceleration in the nonlinear regime was carried out using the approach of @xcite .",
    "the effects of resonant streaming instability were treated as in @xcite , but including the presence of the precursor which implies magnetic field compression in addition to amplification .",
    "we neglected here the possibility of having non - resonant amplification @xcite , for several reasons : 1 ) the relation between pressure and energy flux of these waves is not yet well defined ; 2 ) the diffusion properties of charged particles in turbulence at wavelengths much shorter than the larmor radius of particles are not known as yet , and need a dedicated effort of investigation ; 3 ) as showed by @xcite , the non resonant modes are likely to be especially important in the free expansion phase of a snr and in the early stages of the sedov phase .    perhaps not surprisingly , we find that the effect of magnetic feedback on the spectrum of accelerated particles is that of reducing the concavity . this result can be easily explained based on the reduced compressibility in the shock precursor , caused by the magnetic pressure .",
    "the slope of the spectrum typically remains close to @xmath47 at energies smaller than @xmath48 tev , while being flatter at higher energies ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ucsispettro ] ) .",
    "we also discuss the effect of the amplified field on the velocity of the scattering centers , which causes a further steepening of the spectrum , leading it to get closer to a power law .",
    "we find that the spectrum of accelerated particles becomes even steeper than @xmath49 if the velocity of the scattering centers is assumed to be the alfvn speed in the amplified field .",
    "although this maybe an unphysical assumption , it serves the scope of showing that the results of calculations carried out in this strongly nonlinear regime may well be affected by details which at the present time we are unable to control .",
    "the smoother precursor induced by the magnetic feedback also implies a larger value of the maximum achievable momentum for the accelerated particles .",
    "we recall that , as showed by @xcite , a strong precursor leads to lower the maximum momentum since particles feel a smaller mean fluid speed and therefore a longer acceleration time . using the acceleration time for modified shocks as calculated by @xcite",
    ", we find that for a @xmath50 old remnant the maximum energy can be as high as @xmath51 , a factor 5 - 10 larger than one could find without including the magnetic backreaction . in principle",
    "even larger maximum energies can be achieved by taking into account the non - resonant streaming instability in the early phases of the snr evolution .",
    "our entire analysis was carried out for the case of a shock propagating in the direction parallel to the ambient magnetic field .",
    "the amplification of the background field due to cosmic ray streaming soon changes this situation , in that the magnetic field upstream becomes highly turbulent .",
    "changing the field obliquity should not change much the picture discussed in the present paper as long as the projection of the shock velocity along the field lines remains supersonic . if the supernova shock propagates in a medium in which the background field is mainly oriented in a given direction , there will be locations at which the shock is quasi - parallel and others at which it is quasi - perpendicular .",
    "the implications for the morphology of the non - thermal emission require a dedicated investigation , in that the quasi - perpendicular regions could be expected to be bright because of the more efficient perpendicular configuration , but quasi - parallel regions could be expected to be bright because of more efficient magnetic field amplification .",
    "clearly the degree to which these expectations may be true depends on many details which at present are not under control , although observations of specific astrophysical objects ( e.g. sn 1006 ) will provide us with important information on this issue .    finally , we investigated the effect of turbulent heating on the shock modification .",
    "we generalized the formalism introduced by @xcite and @xcite in order to account for the possibility that a finite fraction of the wave energy is damped on the background plasma .",
    "we find that , although in general the heating of the upstream plasma results in a decrease of the compressibility , the effect is at most competitive , if not subdominant , compared with the dynamical feedback of the amplified magnetic field on the plasma .",
    "when turbulent heating is indeed dominant , a fraction very close to unity of the wave energy is transformed in thermal energy , and the main effect is that of suppressing the growth of the magnetic field , so that it becomes challenging to explain x - ray observations in terms of severe synchrotron losses . moreover in this case the maximum energy of accelerated particles is drastically reduced and it becomes much smaller than the knee .",
    "it is worth stressing that while the magnetic feedback on the background plasma is based on well known physics , the turbulent heating is treated at best in a very phenomenological way , with little attention to the specific physical processes that may be responsible of the non - adiabatic heating and on how modes with different wavelengths are damped . in these circumstances",
    "we think that the effect of magnetic feedback is much more solidly assessed and should be considered as the chief mechanism for reducing the compression in cosmic ray modified shock waves with evidences for amplified magnetic fields .    on the other hand ,",
    "the role of turbulent heating may become much more important for older remnants , when the shock velocity drops below @xmath52 . at these times",
    ", the amplification of the magnetic field may have become less important from the dynamical point of view , so that the magnetic feedback is also less important .",
    "these stages , as discussed by @xcite play an important role in determining the spectrum of cosmic rays observed at the earth , at least at energies much lower than the knee energy .",
