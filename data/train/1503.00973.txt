    "first , we investigate the tubulation from a tensionless flat membrane ( surface tension @xmath11 ) at a high rod density , @xmath6 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : snap_n1024 ] ) .",
    "the protein rods are initially equilibrated with the rod curvature @xmath18 and @xmath10 .",
    "once the spontaneous curvatures are altered at @xmath19 , the rods begin to assemble perpendicularly to the rod axis . for a positive spontaneous curvature of @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) ,",
    "many tubules simultaneously protrude via the bending of straight rod assemblies ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : snap_n1024](c ) and supplemental movie  1 ) .",
    "branches of the rod network are formed on the membrane for a short time only .",
    "when the tubulation is initiated , neighbouring branches are broken through lateral shrinkage of the rod assembly .    for a negative curvature @xmath5 , the rods form a percolated network covering the entire membrane area [ see the top snapshot in fig .",
    "[ fig : snap_n1024](d ) ] and a tubule protrudes under membrane undulation ( see the second snapshot in fig .  [",
    "fig : snap_n1024](d ) and supplemental movie  2 ) .",
    "subsequently , tubule growth occurs along the network .",
    "thus , the tubulation dynamics is altered remarkably by a relatively small @xmath1 .",
    "negative and positive @xmath1 values stabilize and destabilize the network branches , respectively .",
    "the tubulation at @xmath5 is significantly slower than that at @xmath20 and much fewer tubules protrude : the average protrusion time of the first tubule are @xmath22 and @xmath23 for @xmath5 and @xmath15 at @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "such characteristic dynamics is distinguishable from the time evolution of the mean cluster size @xmath24 and the root mean square cluster height @xmath25 , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : snap_n1024](e)(g ) . for @xmath5 ,",
    "the majority of the rods belong to one large percolated cluster during the tubulation .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath20 , @xmath24 decreases as the tubules are formed and the rod assemblies are divided ; subsequently , @xmath24 slowly increases owing to tubule fusion .",
    "branched tubules are formed by this fusion [ see the bottom snapshot in fig .  [",
    "fig : snap_n1024](c ) and the late stage of supplemental movie  1 ] . based on the evolution of @xmath24 ,",
    "the tubulation pathways are categorized into three groups [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : snap_n1024](b ) ] : tubulation via percolated - network formation ( net ) , via partial - percolated - network formation ( part ) , and without percolation ( iso ) . when a percolated network does not cover the entire membrane surface or a large cluster of @xmath26",
    "is maintained for a period shorter than @xmath27 , we categorize the tubulation pathway as part .",
    "( a typical dynamics is shown in supplemental movie  3 ) .",
    "for the entire parameter range explored in fig .",
    "[ fig : snap_n1024](b ) , the final structures are tubules . as @xmath28 decreases , the tubulation decelerates and a smaller number of large tubules are formed .",
    "the tubules are nucleated and grow from the network vertices at @xmath29 or @xmath30 and @xmath5 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : tube ] ) .",
    "the tubule radius @xmath31 is roughly determined by @xmath28 as @xmath32 . at @xmath9 , the tubule with circumference @xmath33 consists of two hemicylinders of the rod assembly .",
    "our simulation results show that the network formation suppresses the tubulation . to confirm this more clearly",
    ", the effects of @xmath1 on the rod  membrane interaction are investigated . a percolated network is not formed during the tubulation at a low @xmath34 of @xmath35 .",
    "rather , the rods assemble into linear clusters and , subsequently , the large clusters ( @xmath36 ) transform into tubules ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : snap_n256 ] and supplemental movie  4 ) .",
    "although the initial cluster formation is slightly slower for negative curvature , i.e. , @xmath5 , no qualitative difference is detected in the tubulation dynamics [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : snap_n256](b ) ] .",
    "thus , we conclude that the suppression of the tubulation at high rod density is caused by the mesoscale network formation .",
    "recent experiments have demonstrated that positive surface tension can suppress tubulation by bar proteins @xcite and budding by clathrin coats @xcite . in our simulation ,",
    "the positive tension and network formation cooperate to suppress tubulation [ see figs .",
    "[ fig : snap_n1024](e)(g ) and [ fig : snap_n256](b ) ] . at @xmath6 ,",
    "the critical tension decreases with increasing @xmath1 : @xmath37 and @xmath38 for @xmath5 and @xmath15 , respectively , where @xmath39 denotes the thermal energy .",
    "these are experimentally measurable magnitudes ( @xmath40 mj / m@xmath41 and @xmath42 mj / m@xmath41 , respectively ) .",
    "the assembly of rods into a clustered network is not suppressed by the applied tension .",
    "in contrast , network structure breaking does not occur at higher tensions [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : snap_n1024](f ) ] .",
    "thus , the network formation is stabilized by the positive tensions .    when a positive tension @xmath43 is imposed for the coexisting states of network and tubules as shown in the second snapshot of fig .",
    "[ fig : snap_n1024](d ) , the tubules continue to grow at @xmath44 .",
    "however , the tubules shrink at @xmath45 . thus , at the critical tension @xmath46 , the tubule elongation force @xmath47 by the rod assembly is balanced with the expansion of the projected membrane area by the surface tension as @xmath48 .",
    "this tension is higher than that required to suppress the tubule protrusion from the flat membranes ( @xmath49 ) , because a nucleation barrier exists for the protrusion .    .",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ]      to clarify the effects of @xmath1 on the network formation , the difference between the free energy of a hexagonal array of the rod assembly and that of a striped array is estimated using a simple geometric model ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sch ] ) . here",
    ", a percolated network is modelled as a hexagonal array with side length @xmath52 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : sch](a ) ] , while an unbranched rod assembly is modelled as a striped array [ fig .",
    "[ fig : sch](c ) ] .",
    "the rod assemblies have rectangular shapes with widths equal to the rod length @xmath53 .",
    "our analysis shows that the hexagonal network can have lower energy for @xmath54 .",
    "this explains why the membranes are trapped in the branched network as a local free - energy minimum .    in the striped array ,",
    "the rod assemblies are aligned in parallel with intervals of @xmath55 .",
    "the rod assemblies are curved upwards and the other regions are curved downwards , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sch](c ) . to maintain the continuity of the normal vector of the membrane , the curvatures have the relation @xmath56 .",
    "the curvature energy @xmath57 of the striped array per the area @xmath58 is given by @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the bending rigidities of the rod assembly parallel and perpendicular to the rod axis , respectively . in our simulation , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 @xcite .    in the hexagonal array case ,",
    "the membrane surface is divided into the following three regions : region i : a rectangular rod assembly with length @xmath65 and width @xmath53 ; region ii : a triangular membrane with side length @xmath53 at the vertex ; and region iii : a hexagonal membrane with side length @xmath65 . on a flat membrane ,",
    "the areas of these regions are given by @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 , respectively . to simplify the calculation , it is assumed that each region has constant curvatures and its area is independent of these curvatures .",
    "region i has curvatures @xmath69 along the rod axis and @xmath70 perpendicular to the rod axis [ along the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : sch](a ) ] , such that it has a saddle shape . regions ii and iii are triangular and hexagonal spherical caps with radii @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively . to maintain the continuity of the normal vector of the membrane , @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "the angle @xmath75 is given by @xmath76 , where @xmath77 , since the vertices of three rod assemblies make contact with each other on the spherical cap and maintain three - fold rotational symmetry . at @xmath78 , @xmath69 has a maximum value of @xmath79 .",
    "as the area fraction of region i is @xmath80 , @xmath52 is obtained as @xmath81 the curvature energy @xmath82 of the hexagonal array per @xmath58 is given by @xmath83    the energy difference @xmath84 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sch](d ) .",
    "the first terms in equations  ( [ eq : str ] ) and ( [ eq : hex ] ) cancel since both arrays have the same curvature @xmath69 along the rods .",
    "hence , @xmath50 is independent of @xmath28 and @xmath60 . in the hexagonal array ,",
    "the curvature energy of the rod assembly is reduced for @xmath54 , and @xmath82 is smaller than @xmath57 for small @xmath69 .",
    "thus , the branched network can be stabilized by a negative @xmath1 during the formation of the rod assembly .    in our simulation , networks with a wider range of @xmath1",
    "are formed for smaller values of @xmath28 [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : snap_n1024](b ) ] .",
    "this dependence can be explained by an effective increase in the area fraction @xmath34 .",
    "the rod assembly region contains more membrane particles with decreasing @xmath28 ( see light blue particles in rod network and tubules in fig .",
    "[ fig : tube ] ) .",
    "thus , the area of region i increases . at @xmath51 ,",
    "the minimum of @xmath50 is twice that at @xmath6 , although the area fraction is only @xmath85% larger [ see the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : sch](d ) ] .",
    "thus , the effective increase in the rod region enhances the network formation .    as @xmath34 decreases , @xmath52 of the hexagonal array increases [ see equation  ( [ eq : l ] ) ]",
    "however , it is difficult for the hexagonal network with long @xmath52 to form spontaneously , since the tubule formation begins before the rod assembly reaches @xmath52 .",
    "the simulation results for @xmath7 indicate tubulation from clusters with @xmath36 at @xmath9 .",
    "thus , the formation threshold of the percolated network is @xmath86 , where @xmath87 . in the simulation at @xmath88 ,",

    "next , we investigate the tubulation from a vesicle of radius @xmath92 at @xmath89 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : snap_sph ] ) and demonstrate that the original membrane curvature @xmath93 changes the tubulation dynamics . for the positive curvature @xmath9 , no tubulation is obtained for @xmath5 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "instead , the vesicle deforms to an elliptic disk and the rods surround the disk rim [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : snap_sph](b ) ] .",
    "a discoidal bud is often transiently formed , but the rearrangement of the rod assemblies results in disk formation even for @xmath5 ( see supplemental movie  5 ) .",
    "thus , outward tubulation and network formation are suppressed in small vesicles .",
    "in contrast , for the negative curvature @xmath91 , tubulation into the inside of the vesicle is obtained ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : snap_sph](c ) and supplemental movie  6 ) .",
    "a percolated network with @xmath94 has a significantly longer lifetime than in the flat membrane case [ see the middle and right snapshots in fig .  [",

    "the coexistence of tubules and a ring is also obtained [ see the left snapshot in fig .  [",
    "fig : snap_sph](c ) ] .",
    "the ring stabilizes an outward bud . for @xmath95 ,",
    "the rods bend the membrane towards the interior ( opposite to the original membrane curve ) , such that the rods locally form a saddle shape in which the two principal curvatures have opposite signs .",
    "the network and ring structures are stabilized by the positive ( opposite ) @xmath96 , but not by @xmath54 .",
    "we have revealed that , in addition to the spontaneous curvature along the protein rods @xmath28 , the perpendicular spontaneous curvature @xmath1 significantly influences the protrusion of membrane tubules .",
    "the percolated - network structure of the rod assembly has a long lifetime for @xmath54 , because the saddle membrane shape at branches of the rod network is stabilized by the opposite curvature of @xmath1 with respect to @xmath28 .",
    "thus , the network formation decelerates the tubulation significantly , despite having a minor effect on the equilibrium property . both positive surface tensions and membranes originally bending in the same direction as @xmath54 can stabilize the network structure .",
    "our findings provide new insights into the regulation of biomembrane shapes by curvature - inducing proteins .    here , we employ langevin dynamics , in which hydrodynamic interactions are neglected .",
    "since the static stability of the network branch is the key factor , we do not expect the obtained @xmath1 dependence to be qualitatively changed by the hydrodynamic interactions .",
    "however , the network formation condition may be modified .",
    "the diffusion coefficient of the proteins on the membrane depends on the protein size , and fast protein diffusion compared to the membrane deformation speed likely enhances the network formation .",
    "the f - bar domain of pascin is considered to have a nonzero side curvature , since it has an s - shape on the membrane surface in the addition to the curvature perpendicular to the membrane @xcite .",
    "pascin induces membrane tubes in a wide range of diameter @xcite . in the present simulations , we did not obtain such a behaviour .",
    "it may require a larger side curvature or attractive interactions between the rods .",
    "the rod assembly with large side curvatures is an interesting problem for further studies .",
    "an assembly of f - bar proteins , cdc15 , has been observed along the contractile ring of cell division @xcite .",
    "their adsorption to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane is considered to yield a ring structure similar to that shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : snap_sph](c ) .",
    "our study suggests that the side curvature may play an important role in the formation of neck - like structures during cell division and membrane budding in endo / exocytosis .",

    "<S> in living cells , membrane morphology is regulated by various proteins . </S>",
    "<S> many membrane reshaping proteins contain a bin / amphiphysin / rvs ( bar ) domain , which consists of a banana - shaped rod . </S>",
    "<S> the bar domain bends the biomembrane along the rod axis and the features of this anisotropic bending have recently been studied . here </S>",
    "<S> , we report on the role of the bar protein rods in inducing membrane tubulation , using large - scale coarse - grained simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we reveal that a small spontaneous side curvature perpendicular to the rod can drastically alter the tubulation dynamics at high protein density , whereas no significant difference is obtained at low density . </S>",
    "<S> a percolated network is intermediately formed depending on the side curvature . </S>",
    "<S> this network suppresses tubule protrusion , leading to the slow formation of fewer tubules . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the side curvature , which is generated by protein  protein and membrane  protein interactions , plays a significant role in tubulation dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that positive surface tensions and the vesicle membrane curvature can stabilize this network structure by suppressing the tubulation .    the bin / amphiphysin / rvs ( bar ) superfamily proteins regulate the membrane shape of cell organella as well as membrane fusion and fission ; therefore , bar protein dysfunction is implicated in neurodegenerative , cardiovascular , and neoplastic diseases @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the manner in which these proteins assemble on the biomembrane and cooperate to reshape the membranes is not well understood . </S>",
    "<S> the extension of membrane tubes from liposomes and specific adsorption of the bar superfamily proteins onto tube regions have been observed in _ in vitro _ </S>",
    "<S> experiments  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> frost et al . </S>",
    "<S> have experimentally determined that f - bar proteins are adsorbed on flat regions of lipid membranes using electron microscopy @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although the assembly seems to constitute the nucleus of the tubule formation , the tubule protrusion process has not been experimentally observed . </S>",
    "<S> recently , tanaka - takiguchi et al . reported that the formation dynamics of tubules from a liposome can differ significantly for different f - bar proteins @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> that is , fbp17 and cip4 simultaneously generate many tubule protrusions over the entire liposome surface , while pstpip1 and pacsin2 generate only a few protrusions from a narrow region of the surface . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the tubules induced by cip4 and pstpip1 have the same radius . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the tubule nucleation process depends on the protein type . however , it is not known what causes this difference in tubule nucleation behaviour . </S>",
    "<S> tanaka - takiguchi et al . also reported that the full length of pacsin2 induces tubulation , but its f - bar domain region alone does not @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , wang et al . reported the tubulation is induced by f - bar domain of pacsin1 more than by the full - length protein @xcite .    in the last decade </S>",
    "<S> , interactions between laterally isotropic objects on biomembrane , such as transmembrane proteins and adsorbed spherical colloids , have been intensively investigated @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to such studies , however , the interactions between anisotropic adhesives have not yet been explored so far . </S>",
    "<S> the bar domains are banana shaped and generate an anisotropic curvature different from the isotropic spontaneous curvature @xmath0 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this anisotropic nature has recently been receiving increasing theoretical interest . </S>",
    "<S> the classical canham  </S>",
    "<S> helfrich curvature free energy @xcite has been extended to anisotropic curvatures @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> dommersnes and fournier have derived a many - body potential of long - range interactions between point - like anisotropic inclusions and found linear assemblies and egg - carton membrane structures using monte carlo simulations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the adsorption and assembly of bar domains have been investigated using atomic and coarse - grained molecular simulations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for example , simunovic et al . </S>",
    "<S> have simulated a linear aggregation of n - bar domains parallel to the domain axis @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the relationship between this aggregation and tubulation remains unclear . </S>",
    "<S> further , tubular formation has been simulated using a dynamically triangulated membrane model @xcite and , also , meshless membrane models @xcite . despite these numerous advancements , </S>",
    "<S> the present understanding of the physics of membrane shape deformation due to anisotropic curvature is still far from complete .    in this paper , we focus on the effects of the spontaneous ( side ) curvature @xmath1 of a protein rod perpendicular to its longest axis on the assembly behaviour . </S>",
    "<S> the side curvature has not been focused upon in previous studies , but here we reveal that it strikingly changes the assembly dynamics . the excluded volume or van der waals attraction between proteins and the membrane can effectively generate positive or negative @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we simulate flat membranes and vesicles using an implicit - solvent meshless membrane model @xcite , which allows a large - scale simulation . </S>",
    "<S> a bar domain is modelled as a banana - shaped rod , which is assumed to be strongly adsorbed onto the membrane . </S>",
    "<S> the rod length corresponds to @xmath2 nm ( the bar domain lengths range from @xmath3 to @xmath4 nm @xcite ) . to investigate the membrane - curvature - mediated interactions , no direct attractive interaction is considered between the rods . </S>",
    "<S> our previous studies showed that parallel and perpendicular assemblies occur separately through membrane - mediated attractive interactions at low protein density @xcite , and that polyhedral shapes are formed at high protein density @xcite for vesicles and membrane tubes .            , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 . </S>",
