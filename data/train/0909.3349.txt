    "pose several challenges to the classical dsa model in the hadronic scenario , where the tev emission is produced through neutral pion decays induced by proton - proton scatter @xcite .",
    "besides requiring efficient amplification of the magnetic field in the upstream plasma and a good correlation between the magnetic field and background plasma density @xcite , the model also implies a cosmic ray energy of @xmath4 ergs for each remnant and an electron acceleration efficiency more than 4 orders of magnitude lower than the ion acceleration efficiency @xcite .",
    "the high density of the upstream plasma in the model also implies significant thermal x - ray emission from the downstream , which may exceed the observed upper limit @xcite .",

    "magnetized turbulence appears to be a more generic and natural energy dissipation channel than the short - length - scale shock fronts ( sf ) .    with the leptonic model , the tev emission is mostly produced by the inverse comptonization of the cosmic microwave background radiation by tev electrons @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field required to reproduce the observed x - ray flux by the same tev electrons through the synchrotron process implies a spectral cutoff in the hard x - ray band , which is in agreement with observations .",
    "the sa model also requires a much lower gas density than the dsa model , which not only explains the lack of thermal x - ray emission from the shell of the remnants , but also reduces the energetics of the supernovae .",
    "the required turbulence generation scale is comparable to the size of the observed x - ray filaments as well @xcite .",
    "the fast variability of small x - ray features may be attributed to rapid spatial diffusion of high energy electrons @xcite .",
    "as we will show in this paper , the agreement between preliminary results from _ fermi _ observations and the model prediction is also impressive @xcite .",
    "the sa by fast - mode waves has been studied by several authors @xcite . both resonant and nonresonant",
    "interactions have been considered . in this paper , we consider the nonresonant acceleration by compressional waves first studied by @xcite .",
    "compared with these original studies , our model has several distinct features : 1 ) most of the dissipated fast - mode turbulence energy is absorbed by thermal background ions ; 2 ) the residual fast - mode waves in the dissipation scales propagate along local magnetic fields and preferentially accelerate electrons in the background plasma ; 3 ) the plasma physics processes in the dissipation range in principle may lead to a self - consistent treatment of the electron injection process at low energies ; 4 ) the scatter mean - free - path of relativistic electrons , which is a free parameter in most of the previous studies , is determined by the characteristic length of the magnetic field , which in a high-@xmath3 plasma is reduced by strong turbulence motions significantly ; 5 ) the high - energy cutoff of the particle distribution is tied to the characteristic length of the magnetic field .    in this paper , we first discuss the sa by decaying turbulence in general and show that fast - mode waves may account for observations of a few sttsnrs ( section [ ts ] ) . in section [ shock ] , we present the structure of the downstream turbulence with both the kolmogorov and kraichnan phenomenology for the turbulence cascade . the transit - time",
    "damping ( ttd ) by the thermal background particles of compressional fast - mode turbulence is considered in the dissipation range .",
    "the stochastic acceleration of relativistic electrons by fast - mode wave turbulence in the subsonic phase is discussed in section [ sa ] , where physical processes determine the acceleration of the highest energy electrons are discussed .",
    "the models are applied to the well - observed tev snr rx j1713.7 - 3946 in section [ application ] .",
    "although the inferred plasma density is much lower than that in the hadronic scenario , some models still have significantly higher densities than that derived from _ xmm - newton _",
    "observations @xcite . in section [ disc ] ,",
    "we discuss how the density may be further reduced by considering the turbulence generation processes and first - order fermi acceleration in the supersonic phase .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section [ con ] .",
    "according to the classical fermi mechanism @xcite , the particle acceleration rate is determined primarily by the scatter mean - free - path @xmath5 and the velocity of the scatter agents @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "very general constraints can be obtained on the nature of these processes when applying this mechanism to specific observations .",
    "for example , @xcite showed that the acceleration process must be selective in the sense that only a fraction of the background particles are accelerated to very high - energies .",
    "otherwise , these stochastic interactions likely lead to plasma heating instead of a very broad energy distribution of accelerated particles as frequently observed in dynamically evolving collisionless astrophysical plasmas . for particle acceleration in solar flares , @xcite argued that this selective acceleration could be achieved in the energy domain ( i.e. , the frequency domain for the waves ) through cyclotron resonances of particles with a spectrum of cascading plasma waves . in the dsa model , the particle acceleration at low energies and the shock structure determine the efficiency of different particle species @xcite .",
    "in the presence of a magnetic field , selective energization may also be realized in the domain of the particle pitch - angle and/or wave direction angle with respect to the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "further constraints can be put on the sa by a spectrum of turbulence . given the small gyro - radii of charged particles in magnetized astrophysical plasmas , charged particles couple strongly through the magnetic field . as a result , the turbulence responsible for the sa will decay as the energy carrying plasma being carried away from the source region of the turbulence by large scale flows and/or magnetic fields for a high and/or low @xmath3 plasma , respectively .",
    "this is the case for the sa in a shock downstream with a high value of the plasma @xmath3 , where the turbulence is generated at the sf and its intensity decreases as the flow moves away from the sf @xcite .",
    "we next discuss constraints on such a particle acceleration scenario .    in the _ kolmogorov _ phenomenology for the turbulence cascade @xcite ,",
    "the free energy dissipation rate is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a dimensionless constant , @xmath9 is the mass density , and @xmath6 and @xmath10 are the eddy speed and the turbulence generation scale , respectively . the eddy turnover speed and time at smaller scales",

    "the turbulence cascade rate is suppressed by the wave propagation effect by a factor of @xmath33 , where @xmath34 ( independ of @xmath35 ) is the wave group speed : @xmath36 then we have @xmath37 and the turbulence decay time is given by @xmath38 where the wave speed @xmath39 . to have significant acceleration through scatter with the eddies , the dynamical range of the turbulence must be greater than @xmath40 which is much less than @xmath41",
    ".    the resonant interactions of particles with waves may be more effective in accelerating particles in this case than the interactions with eddies . for a wave phase speed @xmath34 independent of @xmath35 and a wave spectrum of @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the wave spectral index",

    "and the acceleration time is given by @xmath46 , which is essentially the same as equations ( [ taukol ] ) and ( [ tsckol ] ) .",
    "although the acceleration rate depends on the phase speed of these waves , the scatter rate is proportional to the intensity of waves in resonance with the particles .",

    "for @xmath54 , @xmath55 increases monotonically with @xmath56 . to have significant acceleration , the minimum acceleration timescale @xmath57 must be less than @xmath58 .",
    "then the scatter mean - free - path of the particles @xmath59 must be shorter than @xmath60 it is also possible that the dynamics of the turbulence cascade is not affected by the wave propagation , which only enhances the particle acceleration rate",
    ". then @xmath61 , the dynamical range required for the sa to be significant is given by @xmath62    several sttsnrs have been observed extensively in the radio , x - ray , and tev bands .",
    "x - ray observations with the _ chandra _ , _ xmm - newton _ , and _ suzaku _ , and tev observations with the hess have made several surprising discoveries that challenge the dsa model in the hadronic scenario @xcite .",
    "the leptonic scenario , on the other hand , is relative simple except that the electron acceleration mechanism needs to be addressed @xcite .",
    "the tev snr rx j1713.7 - 3946 is about @xmath63 years old @xcite with a radius of @xmath64 pc and a distance of @xmath65 kpc . by fitting its broadband spectrum with an electron distribution of @xmath66 ( the dashed lines in fig .",

    "the x - ray emitting electrons have a gyro - radius of @xmath72 cm , which should be shorter than the particle scatter mean - free - path .",
    "to produce these electrons through the sa , the turbulence must be generated on scales greater than @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 for the non - resonant kolmogorov , kraichnan , acoustic kolmogorov , and kraichnan phenomenology , respectively .",

    "@xmath80 pc , which is much greater than the ion inertial length and may result from kelvin - helmholtz instabilities or cosmic ray drifting upstream @xcite .",
    "therefore if relativistic electrons from the sttsnrs are accelerated through the sa , they may be energized by high - speed compressional plasma waves .",
    "previously @xcite showed that the non - selective acceleration as given by equations ( [ taukol ] ) and ( [ taukra ] ) leads to plasma heating instead of particle acceleration .",
    "here we give a different argument against these acceleration processes .",
    "the acceleration timescale in the following is given by equation ( [ tac0 ] ) with @xmath56 depending on the wave spectrum and particle energy .",
    "the dsa models are usually favored over the sa models for two main reasons : 1 ) the dsa can naturally produce a power - law particle distribution ; 2 ) the dsa corresponds to a first - order fermi mechanism and is presumably more efficient than the sa , which corresponds to a second - order fermi mechanism .",
    "while how shocks produce power - law high - energy particle distributions is relatively well understood , the second reason appears to be a misconception .",
    "it is true that the ratios of the acceleration and scatter rates are proportional to the first and second power of the speed ratio of the scatter agent and the particle for the dsa and sa , respectively .",
    "but in the dsa models , there are two scatter processes : scatter of particles by turbulence , which causes the particle diffusion , and the particle crossing of the sf due to this diffusion .",
    "the sf crossing rate is about a factor of @xmath81 lower than the particle scatter rate by the turbulence for a shock speed of @xmath82 @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the acceleration rates of the dsa and sa models are both proportional to @xmath83 .",
    "therefore the sa is not necessarily less efficient than the dsa .",
    "the sa at small scales can also be enhanced by high speed kinetic plasma waves @xcite . of course",
    ", the speed of the scatter agent accessible to a particle may depend on the scatter mean - free - path @xmath5 in the sa .",
    "the stochastic acceleration rate can be very low if @xmath84 decreases quickly with the decrease of @xmath5 .",
    "for the dsa and sa by large - scale acoustic waves in the shock downstream , the speed of the scatter agent is proportional to the shock speed .",
    "one just needs to reduce the scatter mean - free - path @xmath5 to enhance the acceleration rate . as we will show in sections [ shock ] and [ sa ] , considering the competition of isotropic cascade with anisotropic damping of fast - mode waves through the transit - time - damping process",
    ", the waves in the dissipation range propagate along local magnetic field lines with a spectrum index of @xmath85 . in a high-@xmath3 plasma , the damping is mostly caused by ions .",
    "the residual parallel propagating waves however preferentially accelerate electrons .",
    "enegetic particles are also subject to efficient acceleration by large - scale fast - mode ( acoustic ) waves with energy independent acceleration and scatter rates , giving rise to power - law particle distributions in the steady - state . at even higher energies , the gyro - radius of the particles exceeds the characteristic length of the magnetic field , which also corresponds to the dissipation scale , the spatial diffusion coefficient @xmath56 increases quickly with energy .",
    "however , due to interactions with large - scale turbulence , both the acceleration and spatial diffusion timescales vary gradually with @xmath56 , implying a gradual high - energy cutoff .",
    "we consider the relatively simple case , where both the thermal pressure and magnetic field are negligible in the upstream and the shock normal is parallel to the plasma flow .",

    "based on the parameters inferred from the leptonic scenario for the tev emission from sttsnrs shown in section [ ts ] , the plasma @xmath3 in the shock downstream is likely high and the fast - mode wave damping by thermal background is then dominated by protons and ions @xcite . the alfvn speed given by @xmath92",

    "weaker fields will lead to lower cutoff energies and harder spectra .",
    "the particle acceleration may be turned off completely for strong fields due to the increase of the characteristic length of the magnetic field , and therefore the particle scatter mean - free - path .",
    "if the magnetic field is predominantly generated by the streamline of nonthermal particles upstream , the models then imply @xmath327 and @xmath328 for this dynamo process and for the kraichnan and kolmogorov phenomenology in the downstream turbulence , respectively .    assuming that the turbulence is isotropic and generated in a narrow spatial scale , the model inferred densities of the downstream flow",
    "may be so high that thermal x - ray emission becomes observable , in conflict with observations .",
    "although the thermal x - ray emission may be suppressed by a lower electron temperature due to dominance of the cooling by cosmic ray ions , we find that a low density is also possible if the turbulence is not isotropic or generated over a broad spatial scale so that the eddy speed has very weak dependence on the spatial scales .",
    "detailed modeling of the progenitor and the evolution history of the remnant may help to constrain the density @xcite .",
    "the application of the models to the snr rx j1713.7 - 3946 also suggests energy equipartition between the magnetic field and the acceleration electrons .",
    "if the rest of the shock energy is dissipated as heat in the downstream , then the overall electron acceleration efficiency will be @xmath329 , which is inversely proportional to the plasma @xmath3 of the downstream flow .",
    "for the kraichnan phenomenology , @xmath330 and for the kolmogorov phenomenology @xmath331 , acceleration is more efficient for stronger shocks , which also produce hotter downstream plasma .",
    "however , the dependence of the acceleration efficiency on the shock speed is rather weak .",
    "these may have significant implications on the origin of cosmic rays and their connection to the properties of the interstellar medium @xcite .    with the fast - mode wave turbulence model studied in this paper , relativistic electrons",
    "may also be accelerated through the first - order fermi mechanism as in the dsa model , especially in the supersonic phase .",
    "the high - energy cutoff can still result from decoupling of higher energy particles with the background magnetic field as their gyro - radius exceeds the characteristic length of the magnetic field .",
    "this is quite different from the dsa models , where the high - energy cutoff is related to a finite lifetime of the shock , shock curvature , or efficient energy loss processes @xcite .",
    "we thank the referee for critical reviews of the paper , which made us examine the acceleration timescale and the shape of the high - energy cutoff of the electron distributions carefully .",
