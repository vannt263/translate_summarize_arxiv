    "however , available numerical studies ( refs .   and this paper ) indicate that , in the examples and to the orders considered , the analytic continuation of the expansions to the line @xmath69 is indeed possible .",
    "these conjectures present a challenge to future mathematical studies of toeplitz determinants .",
    "besides proving them , an interesting question remains if they are valid for other toeplitz determinants with fisher  hartwig singularities , or , even more generally , for pseudo - differential operators with discontinuous symbols @xcite .",
    "transferring some of the results on the fisher  hartwig expansion to spectral properties of such operators would have implications in extending the widom conjecture @xcite to a wider class of functions .",
    "in particular , this may lead to extracting subleading corrections to the von neumann entanglement entropy for free fermions in higher dimensions ( similarly to the one - dimensional case @xcite ) .",
    "another use of the present results may be in application to one - dimensional bosonization ( describing the low - energy fermionic degrees of freedom in terms of bosonic fields ) @xcite . while the subleading bosonization terms ( responsible for the discreteness of fermionic particles ) are model dependent@xcite , it might be possible to fix them for the specific model ( free fermions on a chain ) by using expansions for correlation functions obtained from toeplitz determinants .",
