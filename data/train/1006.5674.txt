    "in addition , some preliminary results are discussed for nstx - relevant parameters ( table  [ nstx ] ) .    for completeness",
    ", we briefly place this work into the context of a substantial body of research that has focused on ct injection for tokamak refueling . the conducting sphere ( cs ) theoretical model",
    "was put forth some twenty years ago @xcite and described the injection of a rigid conducting ball into a strongly magnetized background plasma . in the cs model ,",
    "the alfvn speed of the background plasma is much higher than the speed of the injected ct , and thus the background field can rearrange itself virtually instantaneously in response to the injected ct . in the cs model , it is the magnetic field pressure gradient of the background plasma that eventually brings the injected ct to a stop .",
    "more precisely , the injected ct stops when the background magnetic energy excluded by the ct volume approximately equals the ct s initial kinetic energy .",
    "later , suzuki et al .",
    "@xcite performed mhd numerical simulations taking into account the compressibility of the injected plasma .",
    "they found , by carefully analyzing the energetics of the evolution of the injected ct , that the effects of plasma compressibility are critical for slowing down the injected plasma .",
    "plasma compressibility leads to the modification of both the magnetic field and density at the leading and side interfaces between the injected and background plasmas .",
    "therefore the speed of localized alfvnic and acoustic dynamics of this interfacial region becomes of the same order as the injection speed , and thus the perturbed background field and density no longer can respond instantaneously to the injected plasma .",
    "this , in combination with the higher injection velocities treated in our work , leads to the situation where the background field can be `` stretched '' by the injected plasma , as shown both in suzuki et al.s and our simulation results , with field line tension thus playing a significant role in stopping the injected plasma .",
    "we note that our recent work @xcite and the present work extend the work of suzuki et al .  by treating higher ratios of",
    "background - to - injected magnetic field strength ( @xmath3 ) and density ( up to 1000 ) , respectively , for the problem of plasma injection into tokamaks . finally , within the context of supersonic gas injection , the effects of jet heating ( by the hot background tokamak plasma ) and polarization electric field ( within the jet ) on jet penetration",
    "have been considered @xcite .",
    "accurate modeling of these effects is beyond the capabilities of our compressible mhd code , and thus future work using a two - fluid code with a better heating model is needed to definitively evaluate these effects .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ model ] describes the computational model and problem setup . in sec .",
    "[ results ] , simulation results on unmagnetized dense plasma jet injection and evolution are presented for an iter - relevant scenario ( table  [ iter ] ) .",
    "conclusions and also implications for elm pacing , disruption mitigation , and nstx - relevant ( table  [ nstx ] ) jet injection are given in sec .",
    "[ conclusion ] .",
    "an unmagnetized and high density ( @xmath4 ) plasma jet with spherical radius @xmath5 , centered initially at @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , is injected along the @xmath9 axis into a lower density background plasma with injection velocity @xmath10 ( see fig .",
    "[ config ] ) .",
    "the background plasma is a cube with sides of length @xmath11 .",
    "we use the term `` jet '' because eventually higher injected mass will require that the ball become elongated into a cylindrical `` jet . ''",
    "the model equations , assumptions , and numerical treatments are essentially the same as those in a recent paper on ct injection @xcite , except that the jet has spatially uniform density rather than the double - peaked profile of a ct .",
    "the background plasma has a uniform magnetic field ( no gradient ) .",
    "however , for the regimes considered in this paper , stopping of the injected plasma is provided mostly by field line tension of the distorted background plasma , and thus our results are expected to only slightly over - estimate the penetration depth .",
    "our 3d ideal mhd code uses high - order godunov - type finite - volume numerical methods .",
    "these methods conservatively update the zone - averaged fluid and magnetic field quantities based on estimated advective fluxes of mass , momentum , energy , and magnetic field at the zone interface @xcite .",
    "the divergence - free condition of the magnetic field is ensured by a constrained transport scheme @xcite .",
    "all simulations were performed on parallel linux clusters at los alamos national laboratory .",
    "we note that the details of magnetic reconnection and heat evolution are not captured accurately due to the ideal mhd model and the use of a simplified energy equation , and that future work using more sophisticated models are needed to refine any reconnection - dependent conclusions given in this work .",
    "physical quantities are normalized by the characteristic system length scale @xmath12 , mass density @xmath13 ( corresponding to a 50%-50% dt mixture ion number density @xmath14 ) , and velocity @xmath15 .",
    "other quantities are normalized as ( for the iter - relevant case of table  [ iter ] ) : time @xmath16 gives @xmath17 , magnetic field @xmath18 gives @xmath19 , and energy @xmath20 gives @xmath21 .",
    "the boundary conditions are all perfectly conducting in the @xmath22 and @xmath9 directions except at the entrance port of the bottom boundary ( analogous to the tokamak edge ) where the jet is injected , while in the @xmath23 direction non - reflecting outflow boundary conditions @xcite are employed in order to mimic the toroidal geometry of a tokamak .",
    "the outflowing boundary condition is stress - free , and thus the magnetic flux is not `` line - tied '' to the walls and alfvn dynamics are supported along @xmath23 despite the small simulation domain .",
    "suzuki et al .",
    "@xcite have performed simulations with toroidal periodic boundary conditions .",
    "they found that with such a stress - free boundary condition , the magnetic tension force is smaller ( but _ not _ zero ) , and the relaxation of the tension force from magnetic reconnection is also much smaller ( could even be ignored ) .",
    "an outflowing boundary condition is more appropriate than suzuki et al.s choice for the large aspect ratio case since in real tokamaks the toroidal dimension is much larger than the poloidal dimension , and thus it will take a long time for toroidal dynamics to re - enter the computational domain after traveling along toroidal magnetic field lines @xcite . in order to minimize the influence of the entrance port on boundary conditions , the port is opened ( a hole inserted into the conducting boundary ) when the top of the jet reaches the bottom boundary at @xmath24 and is closed ( hole removed from the conducting boundary ) at @xmath25 after the jet has fully entered the computation domain ( at @xmath26 ) .",
    "this leads to an artificial force pulling back on the injected plasma which is apparent only at late times for simulations with shallow injection ( as shown in fig .",
    "7 ) and does not otherwise appear to significantly affect the injected plasma evolution .    in order to mimic jet injection into an iter - relevant plasma , we adopt physical quantities as given in table  [ iter ] in most of the results reported in this paper .",
    "the major differences here compared to the recent results on ct injection @xcite are the very high density ratio @xmath27 ( where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the injected and background plasma densities , respectively ) and the initially null value of the jet magnetic field .",
    "the computational domain coinciding with the background plasma is @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 , corresponding to a cube of @xmath33 in actual length units ( assuming the injected jet radius @xmath34 ) .",
    "the numerical resolution used here is @xmath35 , where the grid points are assigned uniformly in the @xmath23 , @xmath22 , and @xmath9 directions .",
    "a cell @xmath36 @xmath37 ) corresponds to @xmath38 .",
    "since the plasma skin depth and ion gyroradius based on either iter or nstx parameters are no more than @xmath36 , simulations based on an mhd model are reasonable for this initial study .",
    "figure  [ reconnection ] displays the evolution of magnetic field @xmath39 ( arrows ) and current density @xmath40 ( color contours ) in the @xmath23-@xmath9 plane at @xmath7 with parameters given in table  1 . during the initial jet penetration into the background plasma",
    ", the jet meets a very strong magnetic barrier .",
    "thus , the plasma jet becomes compressed along the direction of propagation ( @xmath9 ) by about 30% at @xmath41 but not much in @xmath23 ( by examining the @xmath42 profile versus @xmath9 and @xmath23 at @xmath43 and 20 , not shown here ) , and the background magnetic field gets distorted as seen in fig .",
    "[ reconnection](a ) .",
    "the plasma density increases at the jet - background interface .",
    "a large plasma current also appears there due to the compression of the background magnetic field , as seen in fig .",
    "[ reconnection](a ) and the edges of the jet ( return current ) .",
    "magnetic fields diffuse into the jet due to numerical resistivity with resistive diffusion time @xmath44 @xcite . for a real jet injected into a real tokamak",
    ", the magnetic diffusion time into the jet will likely be somewhat slower , and more sophisticated simulations ( _ e.g. _ , using a resistive mhd or two - fluid code ) and ultimately experiments will be needed to fully assess this .",
    "however , we believe that the field diffusion into the jet is not critically important for the further dynamics to be described below . the magnetic tension force due to the stretched field lines persists even with our stress - free boundary conditions ( _ i.e.",
    "_ , it is not a result of line - tying ) , although it is smaller than with fixed boundary conditions @xcite . from figs .",
    "[ reconnection](a ) and ( b ) , the speed at which the background field distortion propagates away along the @xmath23 direction can be crudely estimated as @xmath45 , which is slower than @xmath46 .",
    "in addition , fig .",
    "[ va - cs ] shows the local values of the alfvn ( @xmath47 ) and ion acoustic ( @xmath48 ) speeds versus @xmath9 at @xmath43 and @xmath41 .",
    "for example , at @xmath41 , the jet / background interfacial region is centered near @xmath49 as seen from fig .",
    "[ reconnection](b ) , at which location both @xmath47 and @xmath48 are of the order 0.05 as seen in fig .",
    "[ va - cs ] .",
    "thus , neither alfvn nor acoustic waves are fast enough to instantaneously relax the perturbations in magnetic field and density at the jet / background interface . finally , tilting of the plasma jet",
    "is not observed due to the fast injection and short jet transit time .    after the jet has fully entered the background plasma region ( after @xmath50 ) , a region with magnetic field reversal",
    "is set up along the jet s trailing edge , centered about @xmath6 and @xmath51 in fig .",
    "[ reconnection](b ) .",
    "this enables magnetic reconnection @xcite which as pointed out by suzuki et al .",
    "@xcite allows the jet to be `` detached '' from the background field lines and by which the magnetic tension force decelerating the jet is relaxed . clearly",
    ", any reconnection observed in our results is due to numerical resistivity ( see further discussion in sec .",
    "[ depth ] ) . figure  [ rho_vxz ] shows velocity vectors , from which [ along with fig .",
    "[ reconnection](b ) ] we infer a jet configuration at @xmath41 shown schematically in fig .  [ mechanism ] .",
    "the primary reconnection site is located at the trailing portion of the jet along @xmath9 .",
    "this is qualitatively different from ct fueling in which reconnection takes place at the upper left and lower right areas of the ct ( due to the asymmetric ct field ) @xcite .",
    "the reconnection process allows the plasma within the jet to escape and eventually flow outward along the background magnetic field horizontally ( toroidally ) , as shown in figs .",
    "[ rho_vxz ] and [ mechanism ] .",
    "thus reconnection facilitates mass deposition from the jet into the background plasma .",
    "we note that mass deposition into the tokamak plasma was indeed observed for unmagnetized plasma injection on globus - m @xcite although neutralization of their jet in transit could also lead to mass deposition without requiring reconnection .",
    "the latter needs further study including atomic physics modeling .",
    "the initial @xmath9-directed kinetic energy is converted into @xmath23-directed kinetic energy . after the high density jet plasma has been depleted ( after @xmath52 ) , the perturbed background field has nearly oriented again along @xmath23 , the direction of the initial background magnetic field [ fig .  [ reconnection](d ) ] .",
    "figure  [ deep](_left _ ) shows contours of density in the @xmath23-@xmath9 plane ( @xmath7 ) at @xmath53 for the parameters of table  1 , showing deep jet penetration . from fig .",
    "[ deep](_left _ ) , the spread @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) of this line - shaped structure is much larger than for ct fueling @xcite which is about @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "the jet in fig .",
    "[ deep](_left _ ) does not come to rest fully , but a jet with lower injection velocity should come to rest deep in the background plasma .",
    "note that , by comparing with fig .",
    "2(d ) , the perturbed background magnetic flux has mostly relaxed by @xmath58 while the diminishing jet mass has reached @xmath59 as shown in fig .",
    "however , under proper conditions ( see further discussion in sec .",

    "[ deep](_right _ ) with lower @xmath60 . a narrow elongated structure along @xmath23 with penetration depth @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) and a spread of @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) results .",
    "in order to improve the precision of deposition , either lower injection speed , lower initial jet mass , or larger background magnetic field is necessary ( see further discussion in sec .",
    "[ depth ] ) .",
    "the penetration depth is mostly determined by the initial jet kinetic energy . with the magnetic tension force from the background magnetic field @xmath65 ,",
    "the deceleration of the jet is @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the jet initial mass .",
    "note that suzuki et al .",
    "@xcite showed that the ct penetration depth , based on a model with magnetic tension force as the main deceleration mechanism , matches simulation results very well , implying that mhd wave drag forces may not be important in ct deceleration .",
    "if the jet is undergoing a constant deceleration ( a rough estimate ) , the time for the jet to stop is : @xmath68 .",
    "thus the penetration depth @xmath69 of the jet would be : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the jet s initial kinetic energy .",
    "based on this estimate , the penetration depth is roughly proportional to the jet initial kinetic energy and inversely proportional to the magnetic tension force , which is proportional to the background magnetic field .",
    "the cs model @xcite shows that a ct would penetrate to a position where the initial ct kinetic energy exceeds the background magnetic field energy excluded by the ct volume , and a lower limit of injection speed @xmath72 was derived from this requirement @xcite .",
    "however , our simulation results [ fig .",
    "[ deep](_left _ ) ] with @xmath73 ( for table  1 parameters ) show that the jet penetrates the background field easily , which was also observed experimentally @xcite . instead",
    ", the jet must have sufficiently high directed energy to overcome the deceleration from the magnetic tension force .",
    "of course , as mentioned previously , another possibility is that a sizable fraction of the initial jet plasma is transformed into neutrals , which results in more efficient penetration of particles into a magnetic field @xcite . a more detailed study including the effects of atomic physics ( especially three body recombination ) is needed to fully assess the role of jet neutralization during transit .    for internal density profile control ,",
    "plasmas need to be deposited not only deeply but also precisely @xcite .",
    "based on the mechanism of jet mass deposition put forth in sec .",
    "[ evolution ] , a key requirement for localized deposition is therefore to have the jet slowing - down time be less than the time for the perturbed magnetic flux to relax due to magnetic reconnection , @xmath74 .",
    "therefore lower injection speed ( but exceeding the threshold for penetration ) , smaller initial mass , and larger background magnetic field are favorable for accurate deposition but unfavorable for depositing high mass into the core of the tokamak .",

    "given @xmath100 and @xmath101 as in table  [ iter ] , we get @xmath102 , which gives a lundquist number @xmath103 for the real situation . thus , the effective lundquist number for jet - background interactions in our simulations is much smaller than the likely real value in a tokamak , meaning that our simulation results _ underestimate the reconnection time _ of the perturbed magnetic flux and thus might _ underestimate the precision of deposition_. the latter statement needs to be verified by more sophisticated resistive mhd or two - fluid numerical modeling .",
    "however , this will be challenging because the many orders - of - magnitude difference in density and temperature in the problem lead to huge differences in resistivity and viscosity .",
    "an implicit mhd code with small numerical viscosity _ and _ a godunov scheme to handle shocks ( these two are conflicting requirements ) is needed .",

    "our results also show that the penetration depth of the plasma jets is mostly dependent on the jet s initial kinetic energy .",
    "if the reconnection mechanism for mass deposition is correct , then a key requirement for spatially localized fueling is for the jet slowing - down time to be less than the time for the perturbed magnetic flux to relax due to magnetic reconnection .",
    "thus lower injection speed , smaller initial jet mass , and larger background magnetic field favor precise deposition .",
    "proper conditions are identified for an unmagnetized dense jet to have deep and localized deposition in an iter - relevant plasma .",
