    "measurement of the purely leptonic decay of the @xmath5 allows the determination of the pseudoscalar decay constant @xmath6 , which can provide important experimental check on lattice qcd ( lqcd ) @xcite as well as other theoretical predictions @xcite , and can help discriminate among these models .",
    "in addition , since lqcd hopes to predict @xmath7 accurately , measuring @xmath6 would allow a precision determination of the @xmath8 meson decay constant , @xmath9 , which currently can not be measured experimentally .",
    "this would make the precision extraction of the ckm matrix element , @xmath10 , from the @xmath11 meson mixing rate possible .",
    "the branching fraction of the @xmath12 decay in lowest order is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the mass of the lepton and the @xmath16 meson , respectively , @xmath17 is the fermi coupling constant , @xmath18 is the ckm matrix element that quantifies the mixing amplitude for the @xmath19 and @xmath20 quark , and @xmath21 is the lifetime of the @xmath5 meson .",
    "the data was collected with the cleo - c detector at the cornell electron storage ring , a symmetric energy @xmath22 collider . in this analysis about 60 pb@xmath0 data recorded on the @xmath1(3770 ) resonance are used .",
    "about half of the time the @xmath1(3770 ) decays to @xmath23 .",
    "we select these events by reconstructing the @xmath24 meson ( tagged @xmath16 ) decaying into any one of five modes ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 ) which represent about 35% of the total @xmath16 meson decay rate .",
    "then we look for @xmath2 signal candidate by searching for an additional single track , presumed to be the muon .",
    "all accepted tracks must be within the fiducial volume of the main drift chamber with a polar angle @xmath30 and must come from the @xmath31 interaction point . charged",
    "kaons and pions are identified by using both the ionization energy loss ( @xmath32 ) in the drift chamber and information from the ring imaging cherenkov ( rich ) counters .",
    "neutral pions are formed from pairs of photon showers detected in the csi crystal calorimeter and kinematically fitted to the nominal @xmath33 mass .",
    "@xmath34 candidates are reconstructed from a kinematic fit of a pair of charged pions to a displaced vertex .",
    "the tagged @xmath16 meson is fully reconstructed by requiring the difference in the energy of the decay products and the beam energy to be less than 20 mev .",
    "we extract the number of tagged events from fits to the distributions of the beam - constrained mass of the reconstructed @xmath16 meson defined as @xmath35 , where the sum runs over the decay products .",
    "the distributions of @xmath36 for each decay mode are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : md_dist ] where the fit curves are the superposition of gaussian signal functions and third order polynomial background functions .",
    "the total number of tagged events within @xmath37 standard deviations of the peak is @xmath38 , where the systematic error is estimated from the variation of the signal when using an argus shape function instead of a polynomial function to parametrize the background .    , ( b ) @xmath39 , ( c ) @xmath40 , ( d ) @xmath41 , and ( e ) @xmath42 .",
    "the solid curves show the sum of the gaussian signal functions and third order polynomial background functions .",
    "the dashed curves indicate the background fits.,width=326 ]    then the @xmath2 candidates are selected by searching for an additional track with opposite charge to the tagged @xmath16 meson in the barrel region of the detector ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "the muon candidate is required to deposit less than 300 mev energy in the calorimeter , characteristic of a minimum ionizing particle , and not to be consistent with the kaon hypothesis based on the rich information .",
    "we reject events with more than one additional charged track or if the energy of the largest shower unmatched to a track is more than 250 mev .",
    "the presence of the neutrino is inferred by requiring that the measured value of the missing mass squared calculated as @xmath44 be near zero ( i.e. the neutrino mass squared ) , where @xmath45 is the three - momentum of the fully reconstructed tagged @xmath24 meson .",
    "the resolution of the @xmath46 is @xmath47 gev@xmath48 , which is essentially independent of the tagging decay mode .",
    "[ fig : mm2 ] shows the @xmath46 distribution in data for @xmath2 candidate events .",
    "the signal region within @xmath49 around zero contains 8 events .",
    "the large peak at 0.25 gev@xmath48 is due to the decay @xmath50 since many @xmath51 escapes detection .",
    "distribution for @xmath2 candidate events .",
    "the insert shows the region around zero where the @xmath52 signal region is indicated by the arrows.,width=326 ]    background can arise from other @xmath5 decay modes , misidentified @xmath53 events and continuum background ( @xmath54 , @xmath55 ) .",
    "the likelihood of these events are evaluated using monte carlo simulations and the results are summarized in table [ tab : background ] . the total background is expected to be @xmath56 events . because of the uncertainties in the monte carlo simulation , a 100% error is assigned to the background estimate .",

    "the result is @xmath61 the total systematic uncertainty on the branching fraction is @xmath62% , which is the quadrature sum of the systematic uncertainties in the @xmath2 detection efficiency ( @xmath63% ) , in the number of @xmath16 tags ( @xmath64% ) , and in the background ( @xmath65% ) .",
