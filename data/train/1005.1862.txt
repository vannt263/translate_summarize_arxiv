    "diffusion processes are widely used to model financial asset price processes . for example , suppose that we have multiple stocks , say , @xmath0 stocks whose price processes are denoted by @xmath3 for @xmath4 , and @xmath5 are the log price processes .",
    "let @xmath6 .",
    "then a widely used model for @xmath7 is [ see , e.g. , definition 1 in @xcite ] @xmath8 where , @xmath9 is a @xmath0-dimensional drift process ; @xmath10 is a matrix for any @xmath11 , and is called the ( instantaneous ) _ covolatility process _ ; and  @xmath12 is a @xmath0-dimensional standard brownian motion .",
    "the _ integrated covariance _ ( icv ) matrix @xmath13 is of great interest in financial applications , which in the one dimensional case is known as the _",
    "integrated volatility_. a widely used estimator of the icv matrix is the so - called _ realized covariance _ ( rcv ) matrix , which is defined as follows .",
    "assume that we can observe the processes @xmath14 s at high frequency synchronously , say , at time points @xmath15 : @xmath16 then the rcv matrix is defined as @xmath17\\\\[-8pt ] & & \\eqntext{\\mbox{where } \\delta\\mathbf{x}_{\\ell } = \\pmatrix { \\delta x^{(1)}_\\ell\\cr \\vdots\\cr \\delta x^{(p)}_\\ell } : = \\pmatrix { x^{(1)}_{\\tau_{n,\\ell}}-x^{(1)}_{\\tau_{n,\\ell-1}}\\cr \\vdots\\cr x^{(p)}_{\\tau_{n,\\ell}}-x^{(p)}_{\\tau_{n,\\ell-1}}}.}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the one dimensional case , the rcv matrix reduces to the _ realized volatility_. thanks to its nice convergence to the icv matrix as the observation frequency @xmath1 goes to infinity [ see @xcite ] , the rcv matrix is highly appreciated in both academic research and practical applications .    the tick - by - tick data",
    "are usually not observed synchronously , and moreover are contaminated by market microstructure noise . on sparsely sampled data ( e.g. , 5-minute data for some highly liquid assets , or subsample from data synchronized by refresh times [ @xcite ] )",
    ", the theory in this paper should be readily applicable , just as one can use the realized volatility based on sparsely sampled data to estimate the integrated volatility ; see , for example , @xcite .      having a good estimate of the icv matrix @xmath18 , in particular , its spectrum ( i.e.",
    ", its set of eigenvalues @xmath19 ) , is crucial in many applications such as principal component analysis and portfolio optimization ( see , e.g. , the pioneer work of markowitz ( @xcite ) and a more recent work [ @xcite ] ) .",
    "when the dimension @xmath0 is high , it is more convenient to study , instead of the @xmath0 eigenvalues @xmath19 , the associated _ empirical spectral distribution _ ( esd ) @xmath20 a naive estimator of the spectrum of the icv matrix @xmath18 is the spectrum of the rcv matrix @xmath21 .",
    "in particular , one wishes that the esd @xmath22 of  @xmath21 would approximate @xmath23 well when the frequency @xmath1 is sufficiently high . from the large dimensional random matrix theory ( ldrmt )",
    ", we now understand quite well that in the high dimensional setting this good wish wo nt come true .",
    "for example , in the simplest case when the drift process is 0 , covolatility process is constant , and observation times @xmath15 are equally spaced , namely , @xmath24 , we are in the setting of estimating the usual _ covariance matrix _ using the _ sample covariance matrix _ , given @xmath1 i.i.d .",
    "@xmath0-dimensional observations @xmath25 . from ldrmt , we know that if  @xmath26 converges to a  non - zero number and the esd @xmath23 of the true covariance matrix converges , then the esd @xmath27 of the sample covariance matrix also converges ; see , for example , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the relationship between the _ limiting spectral distribution _ ( lsd ) of @xmath28 in this case and the lsd of @xmath18 can be described by a marenko  pastur equation through stieltjes transforms , as follows .",

    "let @xmath41 be the ( nonnegative ) square root matrix of @xmath18 and @xmath42 .",
    "then , almost surely , the esd of @xmath43 converges in distribution to a probability distribution @xmath44 , which is determined by @xmath38 in that its stieltjes transform @xmath45 solves the equation @xmath46    in the special case when @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the @xmath36 identity matrix , the lsd @xmath44 can be explicitly expressed as follows .",
    "[ propmp ] suppose that  @xmath40 s are as in the previous proposition , and @xmath47 for some @xmath49 .",
    "then the lsd @xmath44 has density @xmath50 and a point mass @xmath51 at the origin if @xmath52 , where @xmath53    the lsd @xmath44 in this proposition is called the marenko  pastur law with ratio index @xmath54 and scale index @xmath55 , and will be denoted by mp@xmath56 in this article .      in practice , the covolatility process is typically not constant .",
    "for example , it is commonly observed that the stock intraday volatility tends to be u - shaped [ see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ] or exhibits some other patterns [ see , e.g. , @xcite ] . in this article , we shall allow them to be not only varying in time but also stochastic .",
    "furthermore , we shall allow the observation times @xmath15 to be random .",
    "these generalizations make our study to be different in nature from the ldrmt : in ldrmt the observations are i.i.d . ; in our setting , the observations @xmath57 may , first , be dependant with each other , and second , have different distributions because ( i ) the covolatility process may vary over time , and ( ii ) the observation durations @xmath58 may be different .    in general , for any time - varying covolatility process",
    "@xmath10 , we associate it with a constant covolatility process given by the square root of the icv matrix @xmath59.\\ ] ] let @xmath60 be defined by replacing @xmath10 with the constant covolatility process  @xmath61 ( and replacing @xmath62 with 0 , and @xmath12 with another independent brownian motion , if necessary ) in ( [ eqx ] ) .",
    "observe that @xmath7 and @xmath60 share the same icv matrix at time 1 . based on @xmath60",
    ", we have an associated rcv matrix @xmath63 which is estimating the same icv matrix as @xmath64 .",
    "since @xmath64 and @xmath65 are based on the same estimation method and share the same targeting icv matrix , it is desirable that their esds have similar properties .",
    "in particular , based on the results in ldrmt and the discussion about constant covolatility case in section [ ssecldrmt ] , we have the following property for @xmath65 : if the esd @xmath23 converges , then so does @xmath66 ; moreover , their limits are related to each other via the marenko ",
    "pastur equation  ( [ eqstfh0 ] ) .",
    "does this property also hold for @xmath21 ?",
    "our first result ( proposition  [ propnotconv ] ) shows that even in the most ideal case when the covolatility process has the form @xmath67 for some deterministic ( scalar ) function  @xmath68 , such convergence results may _ not _ hold for @xmath21 . in particular , the limit of @xmath27 ( when it exists ) changes according to how the covolatility process evolves over time .",
    "this leads to the following natural and interesting question : how does the lsd of rcv matrix depend on the time - variability of the covolatility process ? answering this question in a general context without putting any structural assumption on",
    "the covolatility process seems to be rather challenging , if not impossible . for a class @xmath69 ( see section [ sectheory ] ) of processes , we do establish a result for rcv matrices that s analogous to the marenko  pastur theorem ( see proposition [ propmprcv ] ) , which demonstrates clearly how the time - variability of the covolatility process affects the lsd of rcv matrix .",
    "proposition [ propmprcv ] is proved based on theorem [ thmmpweightedcov ] , which is a marenko  pastur type theorem for _ weighted _ sample covariance matrices .",
    "these results , in principle , allow one to recover the lsd of icv matrix based on that of rcv matrix .",
    "estimating high dimensional icv matrices based on high frequency data has only recently started to gain attention .",
    "see , for example , @xcite ; @xcite who made use of data over long time horizons by proposing a method incorporating low - frequency dynamics ; and @xcite who studied the estimation of icv matrices for portfolio allocation under gross exposure constraint . in @xcite ,",
    "under sparsity assumptions on the icv matrix , banding / thresholding was innovatively used to construct consistent estimators of the icv matrix in the spectral norm sense . in particular , when the sparsity assumptions are satisfied ,",
    "their estimators share the same lsd as the icv matrix .",
    "it remains an open question that when the sparsity assumptions are not satisfied , whether one can still make good inference about the spectrum of icv matrix . for processes in class @xmath69",
    "( see section [ sectheory ] ) , whose icv matrices do not need to be sparse , we propose a new estimator , the _ time - variation adjusted realized covariance _ (",
    "tvarcv ) matrix .",
    "we show that the tvarcv matrix has the desirable property that its lsd exists provided that the lsd of icv matrix exists , and furthermore , the two lsds are related to each other via the marenko  pastur equation ( [ eqstfh0 ] ) ( see theorem [ thmconvedf ] ) .",
    "therefore , the tvarcv matrix can be used , for example , to recover the lsd of icv matrix by inverting the marenko ",
    "pastur equation using existing algorithms .",

    "proposition [ propmpgen ] asserts that the esd of sample covariance matrix converges to a limiting distribution which is uniquely determined by the lsd of the underlying covariance matrix .",
    "unfortunately , proposition [ propmpgen ] does not apply to our case , since the observations @xmath92 under our general diffusion process setting are not i.i.d .",
    "proposition [ propnotconv ] below shows that even in the following most ideal case , the rcv matrix does not have the desired convergence property .",

    "observe that mp@xmath56 is the lsd of rcv matrix when @xmath104 .",
    "the main message of proposition [ propnotconv ] is that , the lsd of rcv matrix depends on the whole covolatility process _ not only through @xmath18 _ , _ but also on how the covolatility process varies in time_. it will also be clear from the proof of proposition  [ propnotconv ] ( section [ seccountereg ] ) that , the more `` volatile '' the covolatility process is , the further away the lsd is from the marenko ",

    "equation ( [ eqx2 ] ) is another common way of representing multi - dimensional log - price processes .",

    "note that since all pairs of @xmath522 have the same summation , in all cases the targeting icv matrices are the same .",
    "we see clearly from figure [ figcomprv ] that , the esds of rcv matrices can be very different from each other even though the rcv matrices are estimating the same icv matrix ; while for tvarcv matrices , the esds are almost identical .",

    "we have shown theoretically and via simulation studies that :    * the _ limiting spectral distribution _ ( lsd ) of rcv matrix depends not only on that of the icv matrix , but also on the time - variability of covolatility process ; * in particular , even with the same targeting icv matrix , the _ empirical spectral distribution _ ( esd ) of rcv matrix can vary a lot , depending on how the underlying covolatility process evolves over time ; * for a class @xmath69 of processes , our proposed estimator , the _ time - variation adjusted realized covariance _ ( tvarcv ) matrix , possesses the following desirable properties as an estimator of the icv matrix : as long as the targeting icv matrix is the same , the esds of tvarcv matrices estimated from processes with different covolatility paths will be close to each other , sharing a unique limit ; moreover , the lsd of tvarcv matrix is related to that of the targeting icv matrix through the same marcenko  pastur equation as in the sample covariance matrix case .    furthermore , we establish a marcenko  pastur type theorem for weighted sample covariance matrices . for a class @xmath69 of processes , we also establish a  marcenko  pastur type theorem for rcv matrices , which explicitly demonstrates how the time - variability of the covolatility process affects the lsd of rcv matrix .    in practice , for given @xmath0 and @xmath1 , based on the ( observable ) esd of tvarcv matrix , one can use existing algorithms to obtain an estimate of the esd of icv matrix , which can then be applied to further applications such as portfolio allocation , risk management , etc .",
