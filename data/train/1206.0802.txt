    "d. ruelle @xcite defined smale spaces in an effort to axiomatize the topological dynamics of the basic sets of an axiom @xmath0 system .",
    "the idea of moving from an axiom @xmath0 system to a smale space is motivated by the fact that the basic sets themselves are merely topological spaces and not submanifolds .",
    "the main feature of a smale space is its canonical coordinates of contracting and expanding directions , which are defined using a metric rather than differential topology .",
    "it is well - known that all totally disconnected smale spaces are shifts of finite type . and shifts of finite type are inverse limits of one - sided shifts of finite type , which were characterized by w. parry @xcite as positively expansive open mappings of compact , totally disconnected metrizable spaces .",
    "the natural next step is to consider smale spaces which are totally disconnected in only one coordinate and to work towards a characterization of these as inverse limits of spaces satisfying certain conditions .",
    "williams @xcite looked at expanding attractors .",
    "he proved that these are basic sets which are totally disconnected in the contracting direction and euclidean in the expanding direction .",
    "he provided a construction using inverse limits of branched manifolds and also proved that ( under appropriate hypotheses ) all such basic sets arose from this construction .",
    "we will be working in the metric setting of smale spaces , but the goal is to extend williams results by removing all hypotheses on the unstable sets .",
    "williams relied very heavily on the smooth structures of branched manifolds in his conditions and proofs , and to adapt to the metric setting of smale spaces , we really needed a whole new set of ideas .",
    "we do not simply ignore the differentiable structure of williams systems and adapt his arguments accordingly ; such a development , in dimension 1 , is given in @xcite .",
    "this paper is a summary of the my ph.d .",
    "thesis @xcite .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank my advisor ian putnam for many useful discussions .",
    "in particular , example 3 in section [ results ] was suggested by him .",
    "to provide some intuition for our results , we begin this section with a very brief review of williams conditions for his inverse limit spaces .",
    "this is followed by a proper definition of a smale space and a statement of our conditions and results .",
    "we finish with a number of examples to illustrate our conditions .",
    "r. f. williams @xcite defined an @xmath1-solenoid as an inverse limit @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a compact riemannian branched @xmath4 @xmath1-manifold and @xmath5 is a @xmath4 immersion satisfying the following axioms :    1 .",

    "@xmath6 is an expansion : there exist constants @xmath7 and @xmath8 such that for all @xmath9 and @xmath10 , we have @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the tangent space of @xmath3 and @xmath13 is the derivative of @xmath6 , and 3 .",
    "@xmath6 is flattening : for each @xmath14 there is a neighborhood @xmath15 of @xmath16 and @xmath17 such that @xmath18 is contained in a subset diffeomorphic to an open ball in @xmath19 .",
    "he proves that an @xmath1-solenoid locally has the structure of a ( cantor set)@xmath20(@xmath1-disk ) .",
    "moreover , he proves that under certain conditions ( which were later removed by h.g .",
    "bothe in @xcite ) his expanding attractors are conjugate to @xmath1-solenoids",
    ".    intuitively , williams expansive and flattening conditions are contradictory .",
    "this apparent dilemma is solved because it is the derivative , @xmath13 , that is injective and expanding , while @xmath6 is flattening .",
    "since we are approaching this problem outside of the smooth structure of manifolds , we need entirely different conditions .",

    "then @xmath27 is topologically conjugate to an inverse limit space @xmath63 such that @xmath64 satisfies axioms 1 and 2 .",
    "the space @xmath65 in theorem b is a quotient of @xmath66 , and the proof of the theorem is constructive .",
