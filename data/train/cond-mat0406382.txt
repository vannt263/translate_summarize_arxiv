    "redox processes are relevant to many technological applications , including corrosion , fuel cells and rechargeable li batteries , and the ability to study these processes from first principles is therefore crucial .",
    "the key to a redox reaction is the transfer of electrons from one species to another .",
    "when the redox electron is transferred between very distinct environments ( e.g. metallic to ionic ) the standard local density approximation ( lda ) and generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) lead to considerable errors in the calculated redox energies .",
    "we show in this paper that treating self - interaction with the dft+@xmath0 @xcite method gives considerably better agreement with experiment and thereby provides a tool to accurately predict redox potentials .",
    "in particular , we focus on the study of li insertion in transition metal compounds using gga and gga+@xmath0 .",
    "transition metal ( tm ) compounds have attracted intense research as cathode materials for rechargeable li batteries due to their ability to simultaneously absorb li@xmath5 ions and electrons . in the discharge cycle of a rechargeable battery li",
    "is oxidized on the anode side and inserted as li@xmath6 + e@xmath7 in the tm compound that comprises the cathode .",
    "the energy of this reaction determines the oxidization / reduction potential at which the battery operates .",
    "it is the high redox potential of li cells that makes them so desirable in applications where high energy density is required .",
    "first principles calculations have been used extensively to predict important properties of li - insertion materials such as the average potential @xcite and potential profile @xcite for li insertion , phase stability @xcite and li diffusion @xcite .",
    "while this has led to considerable success in predicting the trends of li insertion voltages @xcite and even new phases @xcite , it has been noted that lda or gga can give relatively large errors for the average li insertion potential @xcite .",

    "this is a substantial    improvement over the gga predicted value of 2.97 v. previously , the    localization of electrons induced by @xmath0 was also shown to    qualitatively affect the phase behavior in this system @xcite .",

    "the errors of gga+@xmath0 and pure gga on all systems for which we have experimental data are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : errors ] .",
    "pure gga consistently underestimates the lithiation voltage , which is a measure of the energy lowering when li is transferred from li metal ( the anodic reference ) to a li@xmath6 ion and electron in the tm oxide or phosphate .",
    "the contribution of the li@xmath6 ion to the reaction energy is largely electrostatic , and one would expect this effect to be well captured in gga or lda .",
    "hence , the large voltage error in lda / gga must arise from the electron transfer from li metal to the tm cation .",
    "since the voltage is always underestimated in lda / gga these approximations clearly penalize the energy of the electron on the tm , thereby lowering the reaction energy .",
    "it seems reasonable to attribute this to the poor treatment of electronic correlations in lda / gga . in metallic lithium",
    "the electron is affected by a small self - interaction in lda / gga as its charge density is delocalized . on the tm ion , however ,",
    "the electron occupies a much more localized @xmath36-orbital and will experience a much larger self - interaction .",
    "the lack of cancellation between the self - interactions contributions to the energy , which are related to an improper description of the correlation effects in lda / gga , leads to a systematic error in the prediction of the redox potential . in the direction in which the electron is transferred from a delocalized to a localized state ,",
    "the reaction energy is penalized ( not negative enough ) , making the potential too small .",
    "the use of gga+@xmath0 allows for a better description of the electronic correlation and , by discouraging fractional occupations of the kohn - sham orbitals , removes the spurious self - interaction thus producing a much more accurate prediction of the redox voltage . while we demonstrate the gga / lda problem and improvement obtained with dft+@xmath0 on li - insertion materials , we believe that a more accurate description of correlation effects within the dft+@xmath0 scheme is also necessary in the study of other redox processes in which electrons are transferred between states of different kind ( e.g. catalysis of organic molecules on tm surfaces ) .",
    "in fact , as explained in ref . , a better description of the electronic correlation ( which enforces the independence of the single electron energy eigenvalues of the partially occupied states on their occupation , thus leading to the elimination of the spurious self - interaction ) is needed to reproduce the physical difference among the ionization potential and the electronic affinity ( or the band gap in crystalline solids ) which plays a very important role in the energetics of processes involving electron transfer . in our calculations",
    "high - spin tm ions are always energetically favored by gga+@xmath0 over low - spin or non spin - polarized states . in copo@xmath10",
    "the non spin - polarized co@xmath9 in gga leads to cell parameters inconsistent with experiment . in gga+@xmath0 co@xmath9",
    "becomes high spin , improving agreement with experiment .",
    "for the other systems the gga and gga+@xmath0 cell parameters are rather close , though gga+@xmath0 seems to lead to volumes that are slightly too high .",
    "jahn - teller distortions predicted by gga are also reproduced in gga+@xmath0 for mn@xmath9 .    in summary",
    ", we have shown that the under - estimation of the lithium intercalation voltage in lda / gga can be corrected by using gga+@xmath0 with a self - consistently calculated parameters @xmath0 , without sacrificing properties that are already accurately predicted by gga ( e.g. jahn - teller effect , cell parameters , magnetic ordering ) .",
    "voltages for most systems are predicted within a few % of experimental values .",
    "we believe that dft+@xmath0 will significantly improve the accuracy of voltage prediction for candidate materials can be predicted , and therefore enhance the capability of screening new materials for their ability to be good cathodes .",
