    "most speculative markets at national and international level share a number of stylized facts , like volatility clustering and fat tails of returns , for which a satisfactory explanation is still lacking in standard theories of financial markets @xcite .",
    "such stylized facts are now almost universally accepted among economists and physicists and it is now clear that financial markets dynamics give rise to some kind of universal scaling laws .    showing similarities with scaling laws for other systems with many interacting particles , a description of financial markets as multi - agent interacting systems appeared to be a natural consequence @xcite .",
    "this topic was pursued by quite a number of contributions appearing in both the physics and economics literature in recent years @xcite .",
    "this new research field borrows several methods and tools from classical statistical mechanics , where emerging complex behavior arises from relatively simple rules due to the interaction of a large number of components @xcite .",
    "starting from the microscopic dynamics , kinetic models can be derived with the tools of classical kinetic theory of fluids @xcite .",
    "in contrast with microscopic dynamics , where behavior often can be studied only empirically through computer simulations , kinetic models based on pdes allow us to derive analytically general information on the model and its asymptotic behavior .    in this paper",
    "we introduce a simple boltzmann - like model for a speculative market characterized by a single stock and a socio - economical interplay between two different types of traders , chartists and fundamentalists .",
    "the model is strictly related to the microscopic lux - marchesi model @xcite and to kinetic models of opinion formation recently introduced in @xcite .",
    "in addition , we take into account some psychological and behavioral components of the agents , like the way they interact each other and perceive the risk , which may produce non rational behaviors .",
    "this is done by means of a suitable `` value function '' in agreement with the prospect theory by kahneman and tversky @xcite .",
    "as we will show people systematically overreacting produces substantial instabilities in the stock market .    in an earlier paper @xcite a similar approach",
    "has been used considering a single population of investors interacting in the stock market on the basis of the microscopic levy - levy - solomon model @xcite .",
    "the emergence of a lognormal behavior for the wealth distribution of the agents has been shown . though the theoretical set - up of the analysis is close in certain respects to that of @xcite , the structure of the model is rather different .",
    "namely , the description of individual behavior follows an opinion formation dynamic strictly connected with the price trend . in this way",
    ", the heterogeneity among agents as well as their social interactions will be taken into account which both are key elements affecting the outcome of the overall market dynamics .    following the analysis developed in @xcite , we shall prove that the boltzmann model converges in a suitable asymptotic limit towards convection - diffusion equations of fokker - planck type .",
    "other fokker - planck equations were obtained using different approaches in @xcite .",
    "this permits to study the asymptotic behavior of the investments and the price distributions and to characterize the regimes of lognormal behavior and the ones with power law tails .",
    "the main finding of the present paper is that the presence of heterogeneous strategies , both fundamentalists and chartists , is essential to achieve basic stylized fact like the presence of fat tails .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce the boltzmann kinetic model for the interacting chartists and the price evolution .",
    "details of the strategy exchange between chartists and fundamentalists are also presented here .",
    "a characterization of the admissible equilibrium states of the resulting system is then reported .",
    "next , in section 3 , with the aim to study the asymptotic behavior of the chartists and price distributions , we introduce simpler fokker - planck approximations of the boltzmann system and give explicit expressions of the long time behavior .",
    "the mathematical details of the derivation of such fokker - planck models are reported in separate appendices at the end of the manuscript .",
    "numerical results which confirm the theoretical analysis are given in section 4 and some concluding remarks are discussed in the last section .",
    "we describe a simple financial market characterized by a single stock or good and an interplay between two different traders populations , chartists and fundamentalists , which determine the price dynamic of such stock ( good ) .",
    "the aim is to introduce a kinetic description both for the behavior of the microscopic agents and for the price , and then to exploit the tools given by kinetic theory to get more insight about the way the microscopic dynamic of each trading agent can influence the evolution of the price , and be responsible of the appearance of stylized fact like fat tails and lognormal behavior .      similarly to lux and marchesi model @xcite ,",
