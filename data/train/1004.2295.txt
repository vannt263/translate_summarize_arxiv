    "here we discuss some details of the aharonov - casher effect , our derivation for the majorana zero modes in half quantum and full quantum vortices in a two - component chiral p - wave superconductor , the splitting of majorana modes in the full quantum vortex , and the effects of multiple layers in sro .",
    "the aharonov - casher ( ac ) effect is closely related to the more well - known aharonov - bohm ( ab ) effect .",
    "they are essentially the same effect , viewed from two relatively different reference frames and are both special cases of the more general berry s phase .    in the ab effect",
    "the quantum mechanical wave function of a charged particle acquires a geometric berry s phase , @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the vector potential and @xmath130 the element of the path of the particle . for a charge",
    "@xmath5 circling a region of flux @xmath131 , we have @xmath132 . this is nonzero even if the flux is completely confined to an area that has no overlap with the particle s trajectory .    in the ac effect",
    ", a moving fluxline acquires a berry s phase as it circles a region of electric charge .",
    "this is the same ab phase as above but in the reference frame where the charge is stationary .",
    "using the lorentz transformation of electromagnetism , the simplest form of the ac phase is  @xcite @xmath133 when a particle carrying a magnetic moment @xmath134 closes a loop in an electric field @xmath26 .",
    "let us explicitly show that this is the same as the ab phase for any shape of fluxline and irrespective of the charge distribution , as long as the flux is confined .",
    "it was originally shown in ref .",
    "that for a point charge @xmath5 at @xmath135 and a moment @xmath25 at @xmath136 @xmath137 where @xmath138 is the vector potential of the moment at @xmath135 , the position of the charge . a fluxline is a collection of infinitesimal magnetic moments @xmath139 along its length ( with a linear density @xmath140 where @xmath141 is an element of length of the fluxline ) . using eq .",
    "( [ eq : acvp ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ eq : acmue ] ) we find quite generally @xmath142 we used the fact that @xmath143 is nothing but the flux , @xmath144 , due to the moment @xmath139 as seen by the charge if it were to go around in an inverted loop , but in the _ same _ direction as the fluxline .",
    "the integration over the fluxline then gives the total flux carried by the fluxline , since the flux is confined completely inside the loop .",
    "this result does not depend on the distance between the fluxline and point charge .",
    "so , it simply generalizes to any geometric charge distribution as long as flux is confined and has no overlap with the charge distribution .",
    "let us take the @xmath40 vector to be constant , pointing at some arbitrary direction .",
    "we perform a su(2 ) transformation @xmath145 this maps @xmath146 , where @xmath57 is the so(3 ) rotation corresponding to @xmath147 , since @xmath148 we choose @xmath147 to be a rotation that takes @xmath40 to the y - axis , @xmath149 where the unit vector @xmath69 is orthogonal to the plane of @xmath40 and @xmath70 and @xmath150 . after this rotation , @xmath151 .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian is now diagonal in spin indices ,    @xmath152    so that it decouples into the two spin - components , and we get two independent zero energy states ( see next section for details ) . here ,",
    "for simplicity we also assumed a vanishing small vortex core so that @xmath42 is constant everywhere but at the origin . using the well known result for a hqv ,",
    "we can write the two zero energy solutions for @xmath153 , @xmath154 where @xmath155 , @xmath156 and @xmath157 and @xmath158 . rotating back to the original basis , the majorana modes are given by eq .",

    "let us now consider a @xmath40 vector that rotates by @xmath64 in a tilted plane of rotation , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : euler ] .",
    "we use the standard notation of the euler angles , taking @xmath40 to be along the @xmath159-axis , which sets it to be    @xmath160    choosing @xmath161 , in the polar coordinates @xmath162 , the @xmath40 vector rotates by @xmath64 as we go around the origin , @xmath163    the rotation @xmath164 takes @xmath165 in the xy - plane .",
    "so , @xmath166 therefore , there is a vortex only in the spin - up component .",
    "then , the zero energy solution is @xmath167 with an associated majorana mode @xmath76 .",
    "if we take y - axis to be at the intersection of the plane of rotation of @xmath40 and the xy - plane , then @xmath168 , and the @xmath76 is found from eq .",
    "( 5 ) in the paper in the spin - down component with @xmath169 .     for the hqv.,height=172 ]",
    "due to the presence of two spin components , two majorana modes are present on a fqv .",
    "while these majorana modes are protected against many types of local perturbations , they will split by the presence of perturbations that break spin rotation symmetry .",
    "these include the zeeman splitting , @xmath170 , and spin - orbit interactions , @xmath171 .",
    "we first consider the case that there are no external fields and no spin orbit interactions .",
    "when the @xmath40 vector is directed along the y - axis , the bdg hamiltonian decouples into the two spin components .",
    "one can then solve independently the bdg equation in each spin component , and then rotate back to the @xmath40 direction using a rotation @xmath147 @xmath172 where @xmath173 is given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : su2 ] ) and  ( [ eq : ss ] ) .",
    "we now add the terms @xmath174 and @xmath175 .",
    "the key point is the transformation properties of these objects under rotations .",
    "starting from @xmath174 ,    @xmath176    since @xmath177 , @xmath178 transforms as a vector .",
    "we can therefore take @xmath40 to lie along the y - axis , and @xmath178 in an arbitrary direction .",
    "we then get @xmath179 the spin - orbit term when @xmath180 was considered in ref .   and found not to lift the degeneracy of the two majorana modes . here",
    "we show that , to the leading order in perturbation theory , this is true for general @xmath181 and any direction of @xmath40 .",
    "using our solution in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rotatedms ] ) we have @xmath182    since @xmath183 , we can find the splitting in the basis where @xmath40 is along the y - axis by rotating @xmath184 and @xmath181 by angle @xmath185 around @xmath69 .",
    "therefore , in general the overlap @xmath186 will contain terms involving components of the integral @xmath187 . noting that @xmath188 and @xmath189 differ by a constant phase , we find @xmath190 since @xmath188 vanishes at infinity .",
    "we conclude @xmath191",
    "sr@xmath7ruo@xmath8 is a layered material , and when a hqv is threaded through the system it goes through multiple layers . in the absence of tunneling between the layers",
    ", there will be one majorana mode per layer bound to the vortex .",
    "here we show that even in this limit the physics does not decouple into layers , but in fact results in an even - odd effect in the number of layers .",
    "we denote the layer index by @xmath192 .",
    "we start with a hqv going around a second hqv . for this case",
    ", the majorana modes on each of the layers for the two vortices acquire a minus sign .",
    "this is generated by the following transformation on the zero - energy hilbert space , @xmath193 to explore the effect of this transformation on the interference term , we should understand whether such transformations for different itinerant vortices will commute  @xcite , i.e. whether @xmath194=0 $ ] .",
    "it is easy to see that for @xmath195 even they commute , while for @xmath195 odd they do not commute , giving rise to the obliteration of the ac oscillations only in the latter case .    in the case",
    "that a fqv goes around a hqv , we denote by @xmath196 and @xmath197 the majorana modes on the fqv , and by @xmath95 the one on the hqv . the transformation @xmath198 associated with the fqv encircling the hqv is given by @xmath199 which takes @xmath200 , but @xmath201 and @xmath202 , being the same transformation ( per layer ) as in the main text . as the transformations ( [ eq : u - hqv ] ) and ( [ eq : hqv - fqv ] ) are the same , the results are the same : the obliteration of the ac oscillations will only occur for @xmath203 odd .",
    "finally , for a fqv encircling a fqv , the associated transformation is @xmath204 by relabeling the majorana modes , the case of @xmath203 layers here is analogous to @xmath205 layers for a hqv encircling a second hqv . therefore ,",
    "no effect on the interference pattern is expected in this case .    to conclude , when either a hqv or a fqv encircles a hqv , we predict an even - odd effect in the number of layers : non - abelian statistics will be present only in the case of an odd number of layers .",
    "in contrast , when a fqv encircles another fqv , the braiding statistics is abelian .",
    "inter - layer tunneling can be introduced between the majorana states on a vortex ( we consider a hqv for simplicity ) .",
    "we note that the tunneling of majorana modes is a different physical phenomenon from that of cooper pairs .",
    "for instance , when the sample has phase coherence along the z direction ( i.e. in the absence of interlayer supercurrents ) and contains a single chiral domain , the majorana tunneling amplitude is exactly zero , even though cooper pairs are free to move in all directions .",
    "this can be understood in two ways  @xcite .",
    "first , since the z direction only appears in the kinetic energy , the momentum @xmath206 along the z - axis is a good quantum number . for a given @xmath206",
    "the chemical potential is shifted as @xmath207 .",
    "so , there is a degenerate flat band of zero energy majorana states in the weak pairing regime , @xmath208  @xcite .",
    "equivalently , from the solution to the majorana modes above , we can see that the overlap amplitude of two majoranas on adjacent layers is proportional to @xmath209 , where @xmath210 is the phase difference between the two layers .",
    "phase coherence means @xmath211 and therefore all the tunneling amplitudes vanish .",
    "this degeneracy is only protected by the additional symmetry in this idealized example and is lifted by phase fluctuations and other symmetry - breaking factors .",
    "but this example illustrates that the interlayer majorana tunneling is subtle and quite different from cooper pair tunneling .",
    "let us now examine the spectrum of majorana modes when there is a finite interlayer majorana tunneling .",
    "the tunneling term acquires the general form @xmath212 we look for eigenstates of the form @xmath213 , satisfying @xmath214=e\\gamma^\\dag$ ] .",
    "when @xmath203 is odd there is always a zero energy solution to this equation , as is clear by the particle - hole symmetry of the hamiltonian .",
    "writing the zero energy eigenvector of the hamiltonian as @xmath215 , it is easy to see that @xmath216 ( @xmath217 ) and @xmath218 where @xmath219 is chosen by the requirement of normalization of the eigenvector .",
    "when all tunneling terms are non - zero , the majorana fermion is spread through the odd numbered layers , avoiding the energy cost associated with nearest neighbors .",
    "when the number of layers is even , there are two such choices for states which then further hybridize and move away from zero energy . as we argued before , for an even number of layers we do not expect non - abelian statistics to play a role in the ac interference .",
    "when the number of layers is odd , a second quantity which becomes of interest to us is the width of the resulting band @xmath220 .",
    "this width is set by the matrix elements @xmath221 , @xmath222 . at zero temperature ,",
    "the width of the band is of negligible consequence for a proper choice of the majorana fermion operator . at finite temperatures , de - coherence results due to the finite band , with a typical time - scale which goes to infinity as @xmath223 or @xmath224"

    "<S> however , the combination of spin - orbit interaction and zeeman term conspire to split the two majorana modes .    _ </S>",
    "<S> experiment._piecing together the various components , we arrive at the following steps . </S>",
    "<S> the parentheses refer to a two - component cpsc . </S>",
    "<S> i ) in the absence of an applied field through the hole in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : setup ] , drive a supercurrent @xmath10 ; ii ) vary the charge @xmath5 on the island enclosed by the hole . </S>",
    "<S> the differential resistance associated with the current ought to show ac oscillations as a function of @xmath5 due to vortex interference . </S>",
    "<S> the period of oscillation would be @xmath111 ( @xmath15 for itinerant hqvs ) ; iii ) apply a field through the hole to nucleate a vortex ( hqv ) . </S>",
    "<S> the interference pattern should disappear ; iv ) increase the field to nucleate a second vortex ( fqv ) . the interference pattern ( for itinerant fqvs ) should reappear . if the interference pattern is detected in ii ) and does not disappear in step iii ) , the vortices either do not possess or can not maintain their non - abelian character over the time of the experiment .    _ </S>",
    "<S> discussion._ our proposal requires several conditions to be met . for the ac effect </S>",
    "<S> , the vortices must be well separated from the charge on the island in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : setup ] . </S>",
    "<S> so , the dimension @xmath2 of the hole must be greater than the magnetic penetration depth . </S>",
    "<S> our proposal requires the coherent quantum motion of vortices . </S>",
    "<S> there is evidence that vortices can act as quantum objects  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the biggest obstacle for such motion is dissipation in the vortex core . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the range of energies that we consider ( @xmath112 minigap ) the core dynamics is effectively frozen . </S>",
    "<S> another impediment lies in overcoming vortex pinning by impurities . </S>",
    "<S> fortunately , superconductivity in sro requires some of the cleanest crystals , evidenced by the observation of a fairly regular vortex lattice  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , methods have been developed using the concept of a flux flow transistor to create an `` easy '' channel for the flow of vortices , thus considerably reducing the critical current for the vortex flow . </S>",
    "<S> an alternative for achieving quantum behavior would be to replace abrikosov vortices with vortices trapped in josephson junction arrays as in the original experiment  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> some conditions must be met for any statistical interaction to be observed . </S>",
    "<S> first , the system must maintain adiabaticity . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the rate for the motion of the vortices must be smaller than the smallest energy gap in the problem . </S>",
    "<S> this is the minigap that separates the majorana zero mode in the vortex core and the next midgap state , @xmath113 . </S>",
    "<S> so , the velocity of itinerant vortices must satisfy @xmath114 . </S>",
    "<S> this is the most important condition for a one - component cpsc . </S>",
    "<S> second , the majorana modes must remain coherent during the braiding operations . in a two - component cpsc , the splitting @xmath101 of the two majorana modes on the fqv results in decoherence . </S>",
    "<S> so , in order to be sensitive to the braiding of majorana modes in the presence of a hqv the braiding operation must run over a time shorter than @xmath115 , therefore @xmath116 .    </S>",
    "<S> we now estimate the applicable range of parameters in sro , where @xmath117 electron s mass , @xmath118  ev  and @xmath119  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the vortex velocity is related through the josephson relation to the voltage drop @xmath23 across the superconductor : a vortex crossing the sample changes the superconducting phase by @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> so , the voltage sensitivity @xmath23 when @xmath120 vortices move across the sample is given by @xmath121  volt for @xmath122 micron . </S>",
    "<S> the conditions for adiabaticity and coherence of fqv majorana modes yield @xmath123  g , which needs only to be satisfied locally over a coherence length at the fqv . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the orientation of the @xmath40-vector is still an unresolved issue ; while a large enough zeeman field along the z - axis ought to overcome spin - orbit interaction to render @xmath124  @xcite , recent studies show that this orthogonality might even be the natural configuration in sro  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , the temperature must be smaller than the minigap not to excite other vortex core states which may lead to decoherence , i.e. @xmath125  mk . </S>",
    "<S> other constraints on temperature might be imposed by the coherence condition discussed above . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that these conditions , while stringent , could still be realized in sro .    </S>",
    "<S> another issue in sro is the existence of multiple layers . </S>",
    "<S> it is possible that this renders the exchange statistics of hqvs abelian . </S>",
    "<S> ( the non - abelian nature of excitations in sro has also recently been questioned in other ways  @xcite . ) </S>",
    "<S> our proposal can be used to see if this is indeed the case . </S>",
    "<S> multiple layers may also result in decoherence . </S>",
    "<S> the interlayer tunneling amplitude of majorana fermions , @xmath126 , depends on microscopic parameters ( this is different from tunneling amplitude of cooper pairs ) . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , in the absence of experimental studies , it is not clear whether the limit of one independent majorana mode per layer would hold or in fact the majorana modes would completely hybridize to form a chiral low energy majorana channel along the c - axis . </S>",
    "<S> if tunneling is present but small , the extra energy scale would introduce a decoherence time @xmath127 for our experiment  @xcite .    _ </S>",
    "<S> conclusion._the proposal advocated in this letter presents a smoking - gun signature of non - abelian statistics of vortices in a superconductor . </S>",
    "<S> our proposal hinges on vortex interferometry based on the ac effect ; a systematic experimental study of this effect in cpsc s would in itself be an important advancement . </S>",
    "<S> we have argued that under reasonable conditions in a two - componenent cpsc , not only hqvs but also fqvs encircling stationary hqvs would exhibit non - abelian statistics due to the majorana modes in the vortex core . </S>",
    "<S> our predicted signature of such statistics in cpsc s is the clear suppression of the ac interference pattern in our proposed set of experiments .    </S>",
