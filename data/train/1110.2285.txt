    "the study of non - abelian topological order has attracted a great amount of interest recently , due to the potential applications in fault - tolerant quantum computation @xcite .",
    "in addition to systems with intrinsic chiral @xmath0-wave pairing order , e.g. fractional quantum hall systems @xcite , chiral @xmath0-wave superconductors @xcite , @xmath0-wave superfluidity in ultracold fermions @xcite etc . , it has been shown that a topologically non - trivial superfluid phase that supports non - abelian excitations can be induced from an underlying @xmath1-wave superfluidity .",
    "an example is the semiconductor / superconductor heterostructures with spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) , @xmath1-wave pairing superfluidity and an external zeeman field @xcite . with the rapidly developing toolbox available for the quantum control of ultracold atomic systems , the elements above",
    "can now be implemented experimentally in ultracold fermi gases .",
    "importantly , the spin - orbit coupling in ultracold bose gases has been made possible by the recent experimental achievement of synthetic gauge field in ultracold atoms and has generated considerable amount of theoretical interests @xcite . on the other hand , the pairing superfluidity in an ultracold fermi gas and the quantum phase transition in a polarized fermi gas",
    "have been investigated extensively during the past decade @xcite . with clean environment and highly tunable parameters",
    ", ultracold fermi gases may serve as an ideal platform for the observation of topological superfluidity and for the study of the interesting physics therein .",
    "in particular , it has been suggested that the majorana zero modes , which have eluded experimental observation for decades , may be detected in an ultracold atomic system with s - wave interactions @xcite .",
    "spin - orbit coupled fermi gas has been under intensive theoretical study recently @xcite . for an unpolarized fermi gas near a wide feshbach resonance",
    ", the soc has been found to result in a bcs - bec type crossover even on the bcs side of the resonance @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has been suggested that the topological superfluid ( tsf ) phase can be stabilized in a spin polarized fermi gas in the presence of soc @xcite . for a polarized fermi gas without soc ,",
    "phase separation takes place near a wide feshbach resonance in a uniform gas , due to the competition between population imbalance and pairing interactions @xcite . with the introduction of soc , the phase separation develops a rich structure involving the topologically non - trivial superfluid state @xcite . for a polarized fermi gas in an external trap , which is always the case in experiments , the various phases naturally separate in real space , with different phases occurring at different places in the trapping potential @xcite .",
    "the important questions here are whether the topological superfluid is stable in a trapping potential and what the detailed structure of the phases in a trap is .",
    "the phase structure involving the topologically non - trivial superfluid phase in a trapped three - dimensional ( 3d ) polarized fermi gas with soc has been examined previously , where it has been found that two distinct types of topological superfluid may be stabilized @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we focus on the phase structure of a spin - orbit coupled two - dimensional ( 2d ) polarized fermi gas near a wide feshbach resonance in a trapping potential .",
    "we study the system using a bcs - type mean field theory at zero temperature . due to the existence of metastable or unstable solutions of the gap equation that are typical in the presence of population imbalance",
    ", we directly minimize the thermodynamic potential @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the 3d case where there are two distinct topologically non - trivial phases with either two or four gapless points in the quasi - particle excitation spectrum , in 2d we find that there is only one topologically non - trivial superfluid phase which is always protected by an excitation gap away from its phase boundary against the conventional superfluid state ( sf ) .",
    "this agrees with the previous calculations @xcite . as has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , when a vortex is created in this phase , a majorana zero mode can be found at the center of it . due to the competition between population imbalance and pairing ,",
    "the various phases appear at different locations in an external trapping potential .",
    "we then map out the phase diagrams illustrating the structure of the phase separation in typical trapping potentials across a wide feshbach resonance under the local density approximation ( lda ) . from our zero temperature mean field calculations ,",
    "we investigate the parameter regions for the existence of a stable topological superfluid phase ( tsf ) in the trap . to characterize the properties of different phases , we calculate the momentum space density distribution for the various phases .",
    "notably , the momentum space density distribution for the minority spin features a dip near the origin in the topological superfluid state , which is unique among the phases that we consider .",
    "we further demonstrate that for appropriate parameters such that the center of the trap is occupied by the tsf state , this signature dip of the momentum distribution can survive the process of time - of - flight imaging and thus may serve as an unambiguous signal for the tsf .",
    "note that the aim of the current work is to provide a qualitatively correct general picture of the phase structure in a trap , as mean field theory is not quantitatively reliable near a wide feshbach resonance in 2d due to large fluctuations .",
    "we have also not considered the possibility of pairing states with non - zero center of mass momentum in our mean field theory .",

    "ii , we write down the model hamiltonian and outline the mean field theory that we adopt ; in sec .",
    "iii , we analyze the minima of the thermodynamic potential and discuss the competition between the various phases ; we then map out the phase diagram of a homogeneous system using the chemical potential and soc strength as parameters in sec .",

    "[ trap_nk](b ) . the corresponding trap - integrated momentum distribution is shown in fig .",
    "[ trap_nk](a ) , where the signature of the tsf state apparently survives the trap integration . in comparison",

    "trap_nk](c)(d ) similar calculations for the case with an sf core surrounded by the tsf phase . as is clear from fig .",
    "[ trap_nk](c ) , the signature dip for the tsf state can no longer be observed in the trap - integrated momentum distribution .",
    "this suggests that the existence of the dip can serve as a signature for the existence of the tsf phase if the momentum distribution of the minority spin species can be detected .",
    "we have developed a mean field theory to characterize the phases of a trapped 2d polarized fermi gas with soc near a wide feshbach resonance . under lda , we have calculated in detail the structure of phase separation of the pairing gap in a trapping potential with various parameters . compared to the 3d case , we find dramatically increased first order phase boundary between the sf core and the tsf phase that surrounds it , which makes it observable in experiments from the density distributions of the spin species .",
    "we then develop a universal scheme for the characterization of a trapped gas .",
    "the resulting phase and density distributions are therefore independent of the trapping geometry and the total particle number , and are determined by a set of dimensionless parameters .",
    "we explicitly calculate the density and momentum distribution of the gas in a trapping potential .",
    "importantly , we find a parameter region where the trap is occupied by the tsf phase only . in this regime ,",
    "the characteristic signature of the tsf state in the momentum distribution can survive the trap integration , rendering the signal detectable in a time - of - flight imaging process .",
