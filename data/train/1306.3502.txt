    "carbon nanotubes @xcite ( cnts ) have emerged in the last two decades as ideal realizations of one - dimensional ( 1d ) quantum systems .",
    "indeed , for electronic excitations close enough to the charge neutrality point , the longitudinal degrees of freedom are effectively decoupled from the transverse ones.@xcite advances in employing as - grown suspended cnts as coulomb - blockade devices@xcite allowed for dramatically reducing the disorder in the samples and the dielectric screening due to the environment .",
    "this breakthrough led to the recent observation of fascinating many - body states , such as the wigner molecule@xcite  the finite - size analog of the wigner crystal  and the mott - hubbard insulator,@xcite as well as to the measurement of significant spin - orbit coupling.@xcite the latter is enhanced with respect to graphene because of the curved topology of the cnt surface.@xcite an important feature of cnts is the absence of hyperfine interaction since c nuclei have zero spin.@xcite this has fueled the pursuit of spin qubits in cnt quantum dots ( qds).@xcite interestingly , spin - orbit interaction in cnts may be useful for spintronics and quantum - information purposes .",
    "in fact , one could manipulate spins by means of either electric fields acting on the orbital degrees of freedom@xcite or by exploiting bends,@xcite or even encode information in the valley index.@xcite    a remarkable property that distinguishes cnts from other 1d devices is the occurrence of two spinorial degrees of freedom , one being the real electron spin @xmath0 , the other one being the _ isospin _ @xmath1 associated with the valley population in reciprocal space . the latter is well defined close to the two non - equivalent points k and k@xmath2 at the border of the brillouin zone , where the apices of graphene s dirac cones touch .",
    "the isospin is commonly assumed to be a good quantum number , which is true for electrons scattered by potentials that are slowly varying in space with respect to the graphene lattice constant @xmath3 ( with @xmath4 ).@xcite however , if the momentum transferred during scattering is @xmath5 , it may make electrons to swap valleys , as the distance between the two valleys in momentum space is @xmath6 .",
    "the object of this article is the theory of inter - valley scattering .",
    "we are mainly interested in the role of inter - valley scattering in coulomb blockade experiments , hence we focus on gate - defined qds embedded in semiconducting cnts in the few - electron regime .",
    "so far , the vaste majority of analytical or semi - analytical theories based on the envelope function in the effective mass approximation@xcite has regarded inter - valley scattering as being either negligible or small with respect to other sources of scattering.@xcite this should not come as a surprise , since inter - valley scattering is inherently not included in the envelope function theory , with the envelope being built as a superposition of bloch states whose wave vectors lie close to the bottom of one valley .",
    "a few theories have considered the scattering induced by short - range disorder , such as atomic scale defects.@xcite a channel of inter - valley scattering of special interest here is the one induced by the short - range part of coulomb interaction , also known as backward ( bw ) scattering.@xcite indeed , bw coulomb interaction exchanges the isospins of two electrons , since these degrees of freedom are ultimately related to the orbital component of the wave function : electrons with different isospins have different crystal momenta , and hence different microscopic bloch states . with respect to the long - range part of coulomb interaction , conserving valley quantum numbers [ known as intra - valley , or forward ( fw ) scattering ] ,",
    "the bw scattering term is much weaker.@xcite note that both fw and bw terms conserve the total crystal momentum in the scattering event .    on the experimental side",
    ", growing evidence shows that inter - valley scattering is significant and measurable .",
    "low - temperature transport data rely on coulomb blockade spectroscopy , based on the precise control of the electron number in cnt qds down to the single electron.@xcite one connects source and drain electrodes to a cnt and operates on a capacitatively coupled electrostatic gate , allowing to rigidly shift the qd energy spectrum with respect to fermi energies of the leads . if the qd chemical potential falls outside the transport energy window controlled by the source - drain bias , no current flows and the electron number @xmath7 in the dot",
    "otherwise , electrons may tunnel from the source to the drain trough the qd while its population fluctuates between @xmath7 and @xmath8 . by recording the differential conductance as a function of the source - drain bias and gate voltage one measures the evolution of ground- and excited - state chemical potentials vs the external magnetic field , linking the slopes of the curves to ( iso)spin quantum numbers.@xcite this spectroscopy allowed to clearly resolve the anticrossings between energy levels of opposite valleys , that were attributed to short - range disorder.@xcite besides , the recent observation of a two - electron wigner molecule in a cnt qd pointed out the significant role of bw scattering in the fine structure of the low - lying excited states , inducing energy splittings comparable to those associated with spin - orbit interaction.@xcite    moreover , the quantitative determination of bw interaction is important for studies of pauli spin and valley blockade in coupled qds,@xcite aiming to realize spin - to - charge conversion useful for applications .",
    "if @xmath9 are the electronic populations of the left and right qd , respectively , the resonant tunneling sequence is the cycle @xmath10 , where the left ( right ) dot is the one close to the source ( drain ) electrode .",
    "a given intermediate state @xmath11 is pauli - excluded from transport if its total ( iso)spin is incompatible with the projection @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) carried by the tunneling electron.@xcite when the two electrons come close to each other in the right dot bw scattering becomes relevant , mixing the eigenstates of ( iso)spin and hence relaxing the pauli blockade .",
    "whereas optical properties of cnts are beyond the scope ot this work , we mention that bw interaction crucially dictates the fine structure of excitons , controlling the sequence of bright and dark excitons as well as their energy splittings.@xcite computational approaches based on the full numerical solution of the bethe - salpeter equation were applied to the smaller cnts@xcite together with simpler but more transparent theories for larger tubes , such as semi - empirical models@xcite as well as treatments within the effective - mass approximation@xcite or the tight - binding method.@xcite few experimental data are available since dark excitons are optically inactive and hence difficult to observe.@xcite    the main goal of this article is the analysis of the impact of bw scattering on carbon - nanotube quantum dots .",
    "we model the gate - defined qd as a 1d harmonic trap , using sublattice envelope functions in the effective mass approximation .",
    "the exact diagonalization@xcite of the long - range part of coulomb interaction for two electrons fully takes into account spin - orbit ( so ) coupling , bw scattering , and disorder  in the form of a generic distribution of defects . in our detailed investigation",
    "we consider the dependence of bw interaction on the microscopic cnt structure ( i.e. , on the chiral angle @xmath14 in addition to the radius @xmath15 ) , going beyond the previous treatment of bw interaction as a contact force.@xcite we include bw scattering and defects at the level of first - order perturbation theory .",
    "specifically , we present analytical expressions for the energies and the spin - isospin part of the two - electron wave function .",
    "such expressions depend only on two parameters , related respectively to the orbital component of the wave function , which can be evaluated through exact diagonalization,@xcite and the distribution of disorder .",
    "we estimate that energy splittings due to bw scattering may be about one order of magnitude smaller than those induced by so interaction but large enough to be measurable in experiments .",
    "the short - range bw interaction is sensitive to the relative position of two electrons in the qd , which is controlled in turn by the competing effects of the long - range part of coulomb interaction and confinement potential .",
    "whereas coulomb repulsion tends to push electrons aside , the qd confinement potential squeezes them towards the qd center .",
    "when coulomb energy overcomes the sum of kinetic and confinement energy , electrons localize in space _  la _ wigner , arranging themselves in a geometrical configuration [ a wigner molecule ( wm ) ] to minimize the electrostatic energy .",
    "signatures of wigner crystallization were predicted theoretically@xcite and observed experimentally.@xcite note that , as a consequence of localization , exchange interactions are suppressed , hence states with the same charge density and different ( iso)spin projections become degenerate .    the fact that the energy cost needed to flip the ( iso)spin is tiny makes the wm regime detrimental for device operations based on pauli blockade .",
    "therefore , in this article we also consider the opposite , weakly interacting regime where confinement energy overcomes the coulomb energy .",
    "this may be achieved if : @xcite",
    "( i ) the qd is sufficiently small ( ii ) @xmath15 is large ( iii ) the effective dielectric screening due to the presence of leads and gates is significant .",
    "our results show that the impact of the bw contact interaction increases going from the wm to the weakly interacting regime , consistently with the shrinking of the correlation hole .",
