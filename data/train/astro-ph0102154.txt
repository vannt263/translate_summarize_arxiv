    "the infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ; neugebauer et al .",
    "1984 ) was the first telescope with sufficient sensitivity to detect a large number of extragalactic sources at mid- and far - infrared wavelengths .",
    "the iras survey covering 96% of the sky detected a sample of @xmath9 galaxies complete to 0.5 jy w hz@xmath8 m@xmath10 .",
    "] in the 60 @xmath3 m band , the majority of which had not been previously cataloged .",
    "while most of these are late - type galaxies with modest infrared luminosity ( @xmath11 ) , some extremely bright galaxies emitting most of their light in the infrared wavelengths were also detected ( @xmath12 ; de jong et al .",
    "1984 , soifer et al . 1984 , 1987",
    " see review by sanders & mirabel 1996 ) .",
    "their observed fir luminosity can reasonably be explained by ongoing star formation and starburst activity , but some of the most luminous infrared galaxies may host an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) .",
    "there are several important reasons for investigating the radio properties of fir - emitting galaxies .",
    "first of all , the observed radio emission may be used as a direct probe of the very recent star forming activity in normal and starburst galaxies ( see a review by condon 1992 ) .",
    "nearly all of the radio emission at wavelengths longer than a few cm from such galaxies is synchrotron radiation from relativistic electrons and free - free emission from h  ii regions .",
    "only massive stars ( @xmath13 ) produce the type ii and type  ib supernovae whose remnants ( snrs ) are thought to accelerate most of the relativistic electrons , and the same massive stars also dominate the ionization in h  ii regions .",
    "this results in an extremely good correlation between radio and far - infrared emission among galaxies ( harwit & pacini 1975 , condon et al .",
    "1991a , b ) .",
    "while the use of radio continuum as a star - formation tracer has been suggested before , the validity and details of the method has not yet been quantified fully . by examining the radio properties of a large sample of fir - selected galaxies , we plan to address the utility of radio continuum emission as a probe of star - forming activity in detail , including its limitations and the magnitude of systematic errors .",
    "another important reason for examining their radio properties is to investigate the frequency and energetic importance of agns among fir - bright galaxies .",
    "if a luminous agn is present , then the associated radio continuum , in excess of the level expected from the star formation , may be detected .",
    "the presence of a moderately compact nuclear radio continuum source is not a sufficient proof that an agn is the source of the observed luminosity . on the other hand , absence of significant radio emission associated with agn activity",
    "may indicate that agns are not energetically important , at least among the fir - selected galaxies ( e.g. crawford et al . 1996 ) .",
    "this radio study of the fir - selected galaxies is particularly timely and relevant in light of the recent exciting discovery of highly obscured and luminous submm sources at cosmological distances @xcite .",
    "though optically unremarkable , these dusty galaxies may dominate the star formation and metal production at @xmath14 .",
    "the majority of these submm galaxies may be too faint optically to yield their redshifts even with the largest telescopes , and deep radio imaging observations such as with the vla may be the only way of identifying and inferring their redshift distribution and star formation rate for now ( carilli & yun 1999 , smail et al .",
    "therefore , understanding the radio properties of the fir / submm - selected galaxies in the local universe may offer a valuable insight into interpreting the nature of these highly obscured galaxies in the early universe .    in the study of an optically selected sample of 299 normal and irregular galaxies ,",
    "condon , anderson , & helou ( 1991a ) found a _",
    "non - linear _ relation between radio , fir , and b - band luminosity , independent of hubble type .",

    "( 1991a ; 313 galaxies in the iras bright galaxy sample [ bgs ] ) extended the observed tight correlation between radio and fir luminosity to the most luminous galaxies in the local universe .",
    "the fir emission of galaxies is sensitive to environmental effects , and density inhomogeneity such as clustering can complicate the derivation of a luminosity function ( e.g. oliver et al .",
    "therefore a study involving the largest possible volume , bigger than large - scale structures such as cosmic walls and voids , is highly desirable .",
    "the aim of this paper is to conduct a new extensive analysis of radio and fir emission in star - forming galaxies using the largest sample available .",
    "our iras - selected sample with full redshift data is six times larger ( 1809 galaxies ) in size and five times deeper in distance than all similar studies and covers over 60% of the sky .",
    "therefore our results should be more immune to such spatial inhomogeneity and statistical fluctuations .",
    "both the normal late - type galaxies and interaction / merger - induced high luminosity galaxies are included in our sample , and possible differences between their luminosity functions are examined .",
    "an accurate derivation of the local radio and fir luminosity functions also allows the determination of the local radio and fir _ luminosity densities _ and thus an _ extinction - free _ estimate of the local star formation rate ( sfr ) . for this reason ,",
    "all cluster galaxies are also explicitly included in our analysis , unlike some of the previous studies .",
    "most existing estimates of the local sfr are based on either uv continuum or optical emission line studies @xcite that are subject to highly uncertain extinction corrections ( e.g. meurer et al .",
    "1997 , steidel et al .",
    "1999 ) . optically thin fir and radio continuum emission provides an inherently _ extinction - free _ estimate of star formation rate and a good calibration for the uv and optical techniques .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows .",
    "the sample selection and the correlation of the radio and fir properties are described in  2 .",
    "the well known radio - fir correlation is examined in detail , and  radio - loud , \"  radio - excess , \" as well as  infrared - excess \" galaxies are identified in  3 &  4 .",
    "the radio and fir luminosity functions for the local volume are derived , and inferences are made on the nature of these luminosity functions in  5 .",
    "finally , the frequency of the agns and their energetic importance are discussed , and the infrared luminosity density is derived and discussed in terms of the star formation rate in the local volume in  6 . the strengths and limitations of using the radio - continuum luminosity density for measuring the star formation rate and cosmic star formation history are also discussed .",
    "the main catalog used for our sample selection is the 1.2 jy iras redshift survey catalog ( strauss et al . 1990 , 1992 , fisher et al . 1995 ) .",
    "this catalog contains 9897 sources selected from the iras point source catalog ( psc ) by the following criteria : @xmath15 jy , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 @xcite . of the 9897 sources covering @xmath18 of the sky ,",
    "approximately 5321 are galaxies and 14 were of unknown type as of 1995 february 6 . among the non - galaxian sources",
    "are hii regions , stars , cirrus , and planetary nebulae .",
    "the matching radio data for the fir - selected sample were obtained from the recently completed nrao vla sky survey @xcite .",
    "the nrao vla sky survey was made with d and dnc configurations of the very large array at a frequency of 1.4 ghz and an angular resolution of @xmath19 .",
    "observations began in 1993 and extended into 1997 , covering the celestial sphere above @xmath20 .",
    "the final nvss catalog contains @xmath21 sources , including most of the galaxies in the iras faint source catalog , which has a flux limit of @xmath22 jy .",
    "both the iras redshift catalog and the nvss catalog have well - known limitations in their completeness ( see above ) . to construct an unbiased complete sample for statistical analysis , we selected objects at @xmath23 and located away from the galactic plane ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "the redshift data are complete only for the subsample with @xmath0 jy @xcite , and we adopted this flux cutoff for completeness .",
    "the sensitivity of the nvss survey is about 0.5 mjy beam@xmath8 ( @xmath25 ) , sufficient to detect all sample galaxies with s / n @xmath26 .",
    "we first constructed a catalog of fir - selected galaxies with 1.4 ghz radio counterparts by cross - correlating the 9897 sources in the 1.2 jy iras redshift survey with the radio sources in the nvss database using a program based on a software written by w. cotton .",
    "we sought radio counterparts in the nvss catalog within 30  of the iras psc positions , and unique counterparts were found in nearly all cases .",
    "this search radius is twice the size of the typical 1@xmath27 error ellipse in the iras psc , and the probability of finding an unrelated nvss source within each search radius is less than @xmath28 ( see langston et al .",
    "1990 ) . two or more",
    "radio counterparts were found in 19 cases  about three times larger than expected from chance superposition .",
    "examination of these multiple matches revealed that they are mostly multiple nvss components produced by a single galaxy with a large angular extent ( e.g. , m82 ) . because the nvss is a snapshot survey ,",
    "some of the extended disk emission in galaxies with a large angular extent was missed .",
    "therefore the 1.4 ghz fluxes for the 134 large late - type galaxies and multiple matches were replaced with the measurements made in the multiple - snapshot study of bright spiral galaxies and the iras bgs galaxies by condon ( 1987 ) and condon et al .",
    "only 25 cases required corrections larger than 30% .",
    "the iras fluxes are from the psc , but those for the galaxies with optical diameter larger than 8@xmath29 are replaced by the imaging measurements by rice et al .",

    "our final catalog of the iras 2 jy galaxy sample sources meeting our selection criteria contains 1809 galaxies .",
    "the names , radial velocities , optical magnitudes , 1.4 ghz and 60 @xmath3 m luminosities , and fir / radio flux ratios @xmath39 ( see eq .  5 ) of the 161 luminous fir galaxies having @xmath40 are given in table  [ tab : catalog ] .",
    "we plan to publish the full catalog in an electronic form elsewhere .",
    "the distribution of 1.4 ghz radio luminosity for the iras 2 jy sample is shown as a function of galaxy redshifts in figure  [ fig : lzplot ] .",
    "low - luminosity galaxies drop out quickly with increasing redshift due to the iras 60 @xmath3 m flux cutoff at 2 jy , but the infrared luminous galaxies are present to @xmath41 .",
    "therefore , our iras 2 jy sample is not only 6 times larger in the sample size compared with similar previous studies , it also includes sources 5 times further away in the redshift domain as well .",
    "the _ bona fide _ radio - loud objects in the sample are pks  1345 + 12 , 3c  273 , and ngc  1275 , all of which stand out clearly in figure  [ fig : lzplot ] with @xmath42 w hz@xmath8 . determining the fraction of infrared - luminous objects that are also radio loud ( due to the presence of an agn ) is one of the key questions we address later ( see  4 ) .",
    "one immediate result from this study is the determination of accurate positions for the iras redshift survey sources .",
    "the positions of iras sources such as found in the iras point source catalog are only accurate to about 15  ( 1@xmath27 ) . in comparison ,",
    "the source coordinates given by the nvss catalog have @xmath43 rms uncertainties , sufficient for a secure identification of the sources even in a crowded or confused field .",
    "for example , the iras position error ellipse for the interacting pair iras  12173@xmath443514 falls between the two widely separated optical galaxies ( see figure  [ fig : i12173 ] ) while the nvss catalog identifies the northern galaxy as the dominant source .",
    "the histogram of position offsets between the iras psc and nvss ( figure  [ fig : offsets ] ) shows that the position offset is less than 10  in over 2/3 of all cases , and this is consistent with the expectation from the iras position error .",
    "the correlation between the radio and fir luminosity in galaxies is one of the tightest and best - studied in astrophysics .",
    "it holds over five orders of magnitude in luminosity @xcite , and its nearly linear nature is interpreted as a direct relationship between star formation and cosmic - ray production @xcite .",
    "evidence for non - linearity in this relation was discussed by fitt , alexander , & cox ( 1988 ) and cox et al .",
    "( 1988 ) for magnitude - limited samples of spiral galaxies .",
    "price & duric ( 1992 ) later showed that radio emission can be separated into free - free and synchrotron emission and suggested that the latter causes a greater than unity slope at lower frequencies .",
    "the plot of 1.4 ghz radio luminosity versus 60 @xmath3 m fir luminosity for our iras 2 jy sample galaxies ( figure  [ fig : lums]a ) shows a nearly linear correlation spanning over 5 decades in luminosity .",
    "the three noteworthy features are : ( 1 ) a unity slope ; ( 2 ) steepening of the relation at low luminosity ( @xmath45 ) ; and ( 3 ) a higher dispersion for luminosities above @xmath46 .    a formal fit to the observed radio - fir luminosity correlation yields @xmath47 log(l_{60\\mu m}/l_{\\odot } ) + [ 12.07\\pm0.08].\\eqno(4)\\ ] ] the overall trend is indistinguishable from a pure linear relation since the overwhelming majority of fir - selected galaxies have @xmath34 between @xmath48 .",
    "the observed strong correlation is accentuated by the distance effect , but the plot of the observed radio and 60 @xmath3 m fluxes ( figure  [ fig : lums]b ) also shows a linear trend spanning nearly three orders of magnitude in flux . in both plots ,",
    "the scatter is about 0.26 in dex .",
    "there is a systematic tendency of galaxies with @xmath49 to appear below the best - fit line in figure  [ fig : lums]a , and the diminished radio emission of these galaxies may contribute to the previously reported ",
    "non - linear \" trend in the radio - fir relation among optically selected galaxy samples ( e.g. condon et al .",
    "such a deviation from the linear relation can occur if the fir or radio luminosity is not directly proportional to the star forming activity .",
    "dust heating by low mass stars (  cirrus \" emission ) may contribute only to the observed fir emission @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the radio luminosity of less luminous ( and generally less massive ) galaxies may be low if cosmic - ray loss by diffusion is important @xcite . because this sample is fir selected",
    ", there is a potential bias towards sources with higher fir / radio flux density ratios ( see condon & broderick 1986 ) . on the other hand , low fir luminosity sources with relatively high fir / radio ratios",
    "may be missed systematically , possibly offsetting the first potential bias .",
    "the presence of any non - linearity or any increase in the dispersion of the radio - fir correlation may be seen more easily by examining the  @xmath39 \" parameter ( condon et al .",
    "1991a ) , @xmath50 - log[{{s_{1.4 ghz}}\\over{{\\rm w~m}^{-2 } { \\rm hz}^{-1}}}]\\eqno(5)\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the observed 1.4 ghz flux density in units of w m@xmath10 hz@xmath8 and @xmath51 where @xmath33 and @xmath52 are iras 60 @xmath3 m and 100 @xmath3 m band flux density in jy ( see helou et al .",
    "therefore @xmath39 is a measure of the logarithmic fir / radio flux - density ratio . for most galaxies in the iras bright galaxy sample @xmath53 , but some galaxies have smaller @xmath39 values due to an additional contribution from compact radio cores and radio jets / lobes @xcite .",
    "optically selected starburst galaxies ( interacting / markarian galaxies ) have about the same @xmath39 values as normal galaxies , and the radio - fir flux ratio appears to be independent of starburst strength ( e.g. lisenfeld , volk , & xu 1996 ) .",
    "the @xmath39 values for the iras 2 jy sample were computed using eq .  5 and are shown in figure  [ fig : qplot ] .",
    "the mean @xmath39 value for the entire sample is @xmath54 , which is in good agreement with @xmath39 values typically found in other star - forming galaxies .",
    "in fact , the 98% of galaxies in our iras 2 jy sample are found between the two dotted lines which mark the five times excess and deficit of radio emission with respect to mean @xmath55 ( solid horizontal line ) .",
    "the effects of measurement errors and source confusion can be estimated from the dispersion in the @xmath39 value in figure  [ fig : qplot ] . before the radio fluxes for galaxies with large angular extent",
    "were corrected using the measurements by condon ( 1987 ) , several objects with unusually large @xmath39 values ( @xmath56 ) were found  resulting from the missing extended flux .",
    "one object , ngc  5195 , also turned out to include incorrect iras fluxes in the iras redshift catalog , confused with its brighter companion m51 . using the correct iras fluxes ,",
    "its @xmath57 became much closer to the sample mean value .",
    "similarly , iras  02483 + 4302 is a well known quasar - galaxy pair and another case of source confusion .",
    "its 1.4 ghz flux was corrected using the measurement by crawford et al .",
    "these occurrences are consistent with the expected source confusion statistics discussed earlier (  2.3 ) . the direct comparison of figure  [ fig : qplot ] with a similar plot in condon et al .",
    "( 1991a ) suggests that the measurement errors and confusion effects are nevertheless small and comparable to those of the bright spiral sample and the iras bgs sample analyzed by condon et al .",
    "there are good reasons to believe that galaxies with much larger or smaller @xmath39 values are inherently different .",
    "firstly , there are several objects whose smaller @xmath39 values are the result of significant excess radio emission associated with agns ( see  4 for a further discussion ) .",
    "there are also a few infrared - excess objects which may be highly obscured compact starbursts or dust enshrouded agns ( see  6.1 &  6.2 ) , and some of the observed dispersion may arise at least in part from the variation in excitation or dispersion in dust temperature .",
    "the clustering of low - luminosity galaxies ( @xmath58 ) above the mean @xmath55 in figure  [ fig : qplot ] is another clue that the scatter in the @xmath39 distribution is more than simply statistical in nature .",
    "this stems from the previously noted deviation from the linear radio - fir relation (  3.1 ) , and it is also the source of a small gradient in @xmath39 noted by condon et al . , due to a systematic decrease in radio emission among low luminosity galaxies .",
    "lastly , the dispersion in the @xmath39 values among the objects with @xmath59 is significantly larger , @xmath60 .",
    "this larger scatter also manifests itself in figure  [ fig : qplot ] as the disappearance of the dense core in the distribution near the mean .",
    "helou et al .",
    "( 1985 ) noted a similar increase in dispersion at high luminosity in their analysis of only 38 spiral galaxies and suggested that the radio - fir correlation may break down for high luminosity sources .",
    "the new data suggest that the correlation still holds but the dispersion is indeed increased ( see below for possible explanations ) .",
    "two different functional definitions of  radio - loud \" objects are found in the literature : one based on absolute radio power and the second based on a relative flux ratio ( e.g. @xmath61 ) .",
    "the former are generally a subset of the latter . here",
    "we call  radio - loud \" only those galaxies hosting radio sources with @xmath62 w hz@xmath8 . in contrast",

    "it is clear from figure  [ fig : lzplot ] that there are only three radio - loud objects in our sample of 1809 galaxies , with several others approaching the radio - loud limit . _",
    "regardless of the exact statistics , the _ bona fide _ radio - loud galaxies are extremely rare among the infrared selected sample_. we discuss below the three radio - loud objects in our original sample in detail .",
    "it appears that each object represents a special case , and their radio and fir emission have physically distinct origins .",

    "its elliptical host is somewhat brighter than the brightest galaxy in a rich cluster ( @xmath68 , bahcall et al .",
    "1997 ) and is probably located inside a poor cluster ( stockton 1980 ) .",
    "the large - scale radio structure from the vla and merlin shows a compact , flat - spectrum core and a single jet extending about 23@xmath69 from the core at a position angle of 222@xmath70 ( conway et al .",
    "1993 ) . unlike the other two radio - loud objects discussed below",
    ", its infrared emission appears to be mostly the continuation of the non - thermal spectrum from optical to radio wavelengths , associated directly with the agn .",
    "* ngc  1275 ( 3c  84 ) * is the central giant elliptical galaxy of the perseus cluster with a seyfert  2 nucleus and may be accreting gas from the x - ray emitting intercluster medium via a cooling flow @xcite .",
    "the bulk of its 1.4 ghz radio continuum emission ( log @xmath71 w hz@xmath8 ) comes from the core component less than 1  in size , but it also has a 10  size extended radio structure that may be interpreted as an asymmetrical fanaroff - riley type i source whose jet axis lies close to the line - of - sight @xcite . the fir emission is attributed to an extended ( @xmath72 ) distribution of dust , possibly from a kpc scale circumnuclear gas / dust structure accreted from a cluster interloper @xcite . unlike the compact nuclear radio source , the 100 @xmath3 m emission in ngc  1275 shows little evidence for variability @xcite .",

    "therefore the overall frequency of agns may be somewhat larger than inferred from the radio - excess alone  perhaps as much as twice as large in the case of the iras selected pg qsos .",
    "further discussions of the frequency of energetically dominant agns are found in the discussion section (  6 ) , including the examination of the mid - infrared properties .",
    "with 1809 galaxies in our iras 60 @xmath3 m flux - limited sample , we should be able to derive the radio and fir luminosity functions ( lfs ) for field galaxies in the local volume with significantly better statistics than previously possible .",
    "since our sample covers a significantly larger solid angle and volume than the samples used previously , fluctuations produced by large - scale structures and clustering should be smaller .",
    "if there is a significant presence of radio agns contributing to our iras selected sample , not only they can be identified as a separate population in the derived radio and/or fir luminosity functions , we can also determine the range of luminosity where their contribution is significant .",
    "several different functional forms have been suggested previously for the radio and fir luminosity functions of field galaxies , such as log - normal @xcite , hyperbolic @xcite , two power - laws @xcite , and power law / gaussian @xcite .",
    "these functional forms offer reasonable descriptions of the observed radio and fir lfs with varying degrees of relative merit .",
    "all previously published studies , however , have unanimously rejected the traditional form proposed by schechter ( 1976 ) as being too narrow to describe the observed radio or fir lfs .",
    "this is surprising because schechter function offers an excellent and robust description of the optical lfs of field galaxies and galaxy clusters ( e.g. shapiro 1971 , schechter 1976 , auriemma et al .",
    "1977 , efstathiou , ellis , & peterson 1988 ) .",
    "extinction effects at optical wavelengths can not explain this discrepancy because schechter function also offers an excellent description of near - ir lfs of galaxies @xcite .",
    "therefore the failure of the schechter form is highly unusual and deserves further investigation .",
    "here we revisit the idea of describing the observed radio and fir lfs in terms of schechter functions for two important reasons .",
    "first , the schechter function has a simple but sound theoretical basis as it follows from a theoretical analysis of self - similar gravitational condensation in the early universe @xcite .",
    "the schechter function has a form @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the characteristic density and luminosity of the population , and @xmath87 describes the faint - end power - law slope for @xmath88 ( schechter 1976 ) . not only is the press - schechter formalism a well accepted paradigm for cosmological structure formation , but the schechter function also describes the observed optical and near - ir lfs of field and cluster galaxies well as already mentioned . if star formation activity is an integral part of galaxy evolution and reflects the nature of the host galaxies , then the schechter function should also offer a good description for the radio and fir lfs as it does for the optical and near - ir lfs .",
    "another reason for reconsidering the schechter form is that the observed departure , namely the power - law tail at high luminosity end for the fir lf , may have been a _ predictable consequence _ of the underlying theoretical consideration in the press - schechter formalism . to be specific",
    ", the press - schechter formalism for cdm structure formation predicts a _ mass function _ of the schechter form , rather than a luminosity function . to make the logical connection between the observed lfs and the press - schechter formalism",
    ", one has to invoke a constant mass - to - light ( m / l ) ratio , which is a reasonable assumption at the optical and near infrared wavelengths . for starburst galaxies , on the other hand , a momentary jump in l / m by 2 - 3 orders of magnitudes",
    "is expected by definition , nearly entirely at the fir wavelengths .",
    "therefore , if the underlying mass distribution is of a schechter form , the resulting fir ( and radio ) lf should be a linear combination of a schechter function ( for field galaxies ) and a high luminosity excess due to starburst galaxies .",
    "hence , we pose a hypothesis that the observed radio and fir lfs are indeed linear sums of two schechter functions , one for the field galaxies and second for the starburst population . choosing a schechter form for the starburst population is largely for self - consistency .",
    "if this population is distinguished only by 2 - 3 orders of magnitude elevation in m / l , then a schechter function should also represent a reasonable form for its lf .",
    "we examine this hypothesis by analyzing the derived radio and fir lfs in detail below .",
    "the characteristic schechter parameters for the observed lfs are derived in two different ways .",
    "a luminosity function is the _ space density _ of the sample galaxies within a luminosity interval of @xmath89 centered on @xmath90 .",
    "thus the lf and associated uncertainty can then be derived  directly \" as @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the measured luminosity density within the  magnitude \" bin centered on luminosity @xmath90 and @xmath93 is the sample volume appropriate for each of the n=1809 galaxies @xcite .",
    "the sample volume @xmath93 was determined by the iras 60 @xmath3 m sensitivity limit of 2 jy and the nvss survey area as : @xmath94 the sampled volume is further reduced by 18% due to the exclusion of the galactic plane and the omitted areas in the iras redshift survey .",
    "the schechter parameters can also be derived from the observed luminosity distribution , @xmath95 . for a randomly chosen sample , the distribution function @xmath95 is given by @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the volume sampled .",
    "the distribution function can then be re - written as @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the characteristic volume associated with @xmath86 . given these analytical expressions for the luminosity distribution and luminosity function , a @xmath100 analysis is performed on the observed @xmath101 and @xmath95 to deduce the characteristic schechter parameters .",
    "the schechter parameters derived from @xmath101 and @xmath95 are slightly different because the two methods are subject to slightly different systematic effects .",
    "in addition to the formal uncertainties given by the @xmath100 analysis , the difference between the best - fit parameters derived by the two different methods offers a quantitative measure of the systematic errors in the derivations .    a potential source of confusion in comparing the derived lfs from one study to another is the definition of luminosity interval @xmath89 used . both  per magnitude \" and  per dex \" are commonly used in the literature .",
    "we adopt  per magnitude ( mag@xmath8 ) \" in our derivations of radio and fir luminosity functions .",
    "all published luminosity functions using  dex@xmath8 \" intervals ( e.g. saunders et al . 1990 ) are thus corrected by a factor of 2.5 before making any comparisons .",
    "the iras 60 @xmath3 m luminosity distribution and luminosity function for the iras 2 jy sample galaxies are constructed using 18 luminosity bins of log @xmath102 ( @xmath103 ) between 7.75 and 12.25 with a width of @xmath104 .",

    "the combination of an even cleaner break seen in the 1.4 ghz radio lf ( see below ) and the excellent fits reported in table  [ tab:60lf.fits ] lend strong support for the two schechter function description and the implied physical explanation in terms of an elevated mass - to - light ratio for the starburst population .",
    "significant differences are seen among the several 60 @xmath3 m lfs compared in figure  [ fig:60lf]b at the low luminosity end .",

    "one explanation for the different faint end slope may be the sample completeness as the surveys with particular emphasis on the completeness ( e.g. smith et al .",
    ", stauss & huchra ) tend to derive a steeper faint end slope .",
    "in contrast , saunders et al . data probably suffers the worse completeness problem because their luminosity function is derived using a heterogeneous collection of several different surveys .",

    "[ fig:60lf]c ) shows that our sample is distributed fairly uniformly within the sampling volume ( @xmath118 ) .",
    "the derived @xmath105 for our sample dips below 0.5 at log @xmath119 , albeit with large errorbars .",
    "this can be interpreted as an indication of local density enhancement and may be reflecting our special location within the local galaxy group and the local super - cluster .",
    "derivation of lfs using the @xmath120 method ( eq .",
    "8) has been suggested to be susceptible to the large scale inhomogeneity , and the steep rise in the derived lf at the faint end may be an artifact of this bias .",
    "the steepest rise in the faint end slope is associated with the lf derived by soifer et al . which also has the smallest sampling volume , in accordance with this expectation .",
    "assuming the luminosity function has a universal form , yahil et al .",
    "( 1991 ) proposed a density - independent determination of the luminosity function by introducing a selection function which accounts for the distance effect .",

    "derivation of a double power - law form lf using an earlier version of the iras redshift catalog is shown as a dotted curve in figure  [ fig:60lf]b . while the derived faint end slope is flatter and shallower than the lf we derive , it is also steeper and higher than the lf derived by saunders et al .",
    "( also see their fig .",
    "even such a density - independent method faces a fundamental limitation if the faint end slope is constrained by the low luminosity objects that are drawn mainly from the local volume with enhanced density .",

    "it should be noted , however , that these differences between the various lfs at low",
    "l do not have much effect on the implied star formation density discussed below (  6.4 ) since the star - formation rate is proportional to the lf multiplied by l , a function peaking at higher luminosity .      because our sample is selected by the iras 60 @xmath3 m band flux density , deriving the 1.4 ghz radio luminosity function for the same sample",
    "is not as straight forward as in the 60 @xmath3 m lf case . in particular ,",

    ", the 1.4 ghz radio luminosity function is derived using the sampling volume corresponding to the iras 60 @xmath3 m luminosity of each sample galaxy .",
    "the logic behind this calculation is that each sample galaxy contributes to the local number density at their respective luminosity bins in exactly the same manner for both the 60 @xmath3 m and 1.4 ghz lf , and sample selection is reflected identically by the sample volume determined by the iras 60 @xmath3 m flux limit .",

    "the observed radio lf is significantly flatter than the best fit schechter function below @xmath126 w hz@xmath8 .",
    "in addition to the possible effects of sample completeness and local density enhancement , the systematic deviation from the linear radio - fir relation may further contribute to this flattening .",

    "the flux cutoff of 2 jy at 60 @xmath3 m and the resulting volume sampled are probably not sufficient to fairly represent these rarest objects with high luminosity .",
    "the comparison of our radio lf ( filled circles ) with that of the flux limited sample of ugc galaxies by condon ( 1989 ; open circles ) shows that the low radio luminosity galaxies in our iras selected sample are nearly identical to the  starburst \" galaxies ( late type galaxies in the field , as opposed to  monsters \" ) in the ugc catalog ( see figure  [ fig:1.4lf]b ) .",
    "the small excess associated with the iras 2 jy sample is entirely accounted by the cluster galaxy population . when all galaxies within the 3 mpc projected diameter of the known clusters within 100 mpc distance are removed , the resulting radio lf is indistinguishable from the ugc sample lf .",
    "the significance of this result is that _ there is a complete overlap between the optically selected late type galaxies and iras selected galaxies in the field_. in other words , the measured radio luminosity may be used to infer star - forming activity for late - type galaxies in the field with the same level of confidence as using their fir luminosity .",
    "estimating the star - formation rate for an individual galaxy using its radio luminosity may still be uncertain by the magnitude of the observed scatter in figure  [ fig : qplot ] , but such an analysis for an ensemble of galaxies should be significantly more reliable ( see  6.5 ) .    the comparison with the  monsters \" in the ugc sample ( open squares ) , which has a flat luminosity function , is more complicated .",
    "the 1.4 ghz radio lf for the  monsters \" derived by condon is comparable to that of our iras selected galaxy sample for @xmath132 between @xmath133 and @xmath134 w hz@xmath8 , but the difference quickly grows to more than an order of magnitude at @xmath135 w hz@xmath8 .",
    "this disagreement at the highest luminosity is highly statistically significant , and it must be explained by the incompleteness in the iras 2 jy sample .",
    "the lf of galaxies is a property of galaxies and not of the sample ; the @xmath120 weighting is supposed to correct for sample selection effects . with a sufficiently large sample of iras galaxies ,",
    "the lf should equal the lf of optical / radio selected ugc galaxies , including both starbursts and monsters .",

    "the infrared color - color diagrams shown in figure  [ fig : color ] provide a useful tool for probing the mean radiation field and dust composition . in analyzing the iras colors of field galaxies , helou ( 1986 ) found a linear trend of increasing dust temperature with increasing luminosity as shown by the dashed parallel tracks in figure  [ fig : color ] .",
    "the high - luminosity objects ( filled large circles ) as a group show a systematically larger 60 @xmath3 m to 100 @xmath3 m flux ratio , which is an indication of warmer mean dust temperature ( @xmath139 , @xmath140  k ) .",

    "further , about 30% ( 7/23 ) of the radio - excess objects appear to the left of the mid - ir excess line in figure  [ fig : color2 ] , indicating that some of the radio agns do not contribute significantly to their host s infrared luminosity .",

    "such compact and intense starbursts can indeed account for the large @xmath149 ratios and high extinction at the same time .",
    "these infrared excess objects may actually represent a special phase in the starburst evolution .    the existing data , however , can not uniquely distinguish whether these fir - excess objects are powered by a dust enshrouded agn or by a compact starburst .",
    "if a dense environment and associated large opacity is responsible for the observed infrared excess , then one can not possibly probe the energy source directly since the central active region must be opaque  even for hard x - ray photons if the line of sight column density exceeds @xmath134 cm@xmath10 .",
    "if free - free absorption is responsible for the low 1.4 ghz flux , then dense ionized gas must fill most of the 1.4 ghz source volume ( @xmath151 pc in size ) .",

    "thus an extended , distributed source ( a starburst ) is favored over a single point source ( an agn ) to account for the observed ionization .",
    "what is more certain is that such a compact starburst phase or a dust - enshrouded agn phase must be brief , perhaps only a few percent of the ir bright phase , because only nine out of 1809 sources show such infrared excess . , and such infrared - excess objects are extremely rare . ] converting significant fraction of the agn luminosity into thermal dust emission",
    "requires a geometry for thoroughly enshrouding the agn with dust .",

    "a total of 1467 galaxies ( 81% ) belong to the luminosity range between @xmath152 and @xmath133 w hz@xmath8 where the two lfs are essentially identical .",
    "the luminosity range over which the two lfs agree within a factor of two includes over 98% of the total sample .",
    "thus , the similarity between the two lfs stems from the fact that the overwhelming majority of galaxies in our iras selected sample follow the same linear radio - fir correlation .",
    "evidence for diminished radio emission among low - luminosity galaxies was discussed earlier ( see  3.1 and in fig .  [",
    "fig : qplot ] ) , but its collective impact on the radio and fir lf appears to be minimal .",
    "this non - linearity among the low - luminosity galaxies should result in flattening of the radio lf with respect to the 60 @xmath3 m lf .",
    "indeed a hint of such an offset is seen in figure  [ fig : comparelf ] , but the difference is marginal .",
    "a more substantial difference is seen at the high luminosity end , where a dramatic increase in the radio lf over the 60 @xmath3 m lf is seen near @xmath153 w hz@xmath8 ( @xmath154 ) .",
    "while this may be interpreted as a sign of increased agn activity associated with the high luminosity population , the falloff in the lf by an order of magnitude near @xmath155 w hz@xmath8 is not consistent with such a supposition ( see  5.2 ) .",
    "the frequency of radio - excess objects was found to be independent of luminosity in  4.2 , and the constant agn fraction should appear as a small and constant offset between the two lfs . a plausible explanation for the large scatter may be the small number statistics in the total numbers of objects and the agn frequency in these bins .",
    "the derivation of the integrated iras 60 @xmath3 m luminosity density for the local volume is shown in figure  [ fig : sumlf60 ] .",
    "the derived 60 @xmath3 m luminosity density integrated between @xmath156 and @xmath157 for the iras 2 jy sample is @xmath158 mpc@xmath5 .",
    "this estimate lies midway between the values derived from the 60 @xmath3 m lfs of soifer et al .",
    "( 1987 ) and  s17 \" of saunders et al .",
    "these differences arise mainly from the different behaviors of these lfs at low luminosity end ( see fig .  [ fig:60lf]b and  5.3 ) , and the observed scatter can be interpreted as a measure of uncertainty resulting from the sample selection and clustering of galaxies . in all three cases , the integrated luminosity density reaches the asymptotic peak value near @xmath115 , and the _ infrared luminous galaxies ( @xmath6 ) contribute less than @xmath159 to the fir luminosity density in the local volume ( @xmath160)_.    using eq .  3 and assuming a median iras 60 @xmath3 m to 100 @xmath3 m flux ratio of 0.5 ( see figure  [ fig : color2 ] ) , we estimate a local fir luminosity density of @xmath4 mpc@xmath5 .",
    "this is midway between the values derived by soifer et al .",

    "can then be used to derive the _ extinction - free _ star formation rate ( sfr ) for the local volume assuming the observed fir luminosity is proportional to the level of star forming activity .",
    "a wide range of conversion relations between sfr and @xmath35 are found in the literature , based on either a starburst model or an observational analysis ( e.g. , hunter et al .",

    ", we derive the star formation rate of @xmath167 @xmath163 yr@xmath8 mpc@xmath5 for the local volume ( @xmath168 ) .",
    "since more than 90% of the local fir luminosity density is contributed by normal , late - type field galaxies rather than by the starburst population , a conversion relation derived for late - type field galaxies may be more appropriate for the iras 2 jy sample .",
    "the local star formation density derived using the conversion relation derived for the field galaxies by buat & xu ( 1996 ) is slightly larger , @xmath169 @xmath163 yr@xmath8 mpc@xmath5 .",
    "contribution from cold cirrus and smaller optical depth in late type galaxies add some uncertainty to the inference of star - formation rate from fir luminosity ( see kennicutt 1998a for a detailed discussion ) .",

    "( 1995 ) using the conversion relation given by kennicutt ( 1998a ) is @xmath170 yr@xmath8 mpc@xmath5 .",
    "an important consequence is that the local sfr derived from the fir luminosity density provides an independent estimate for @xmath171 and lends a further support for the @xmath171 normalization for the cosmic star - formation history models such as those by blain et al .",
    "( 1999 ; dashed line ) and by tan et al .",
    "( 1999 ; solid line ) as well as support for the larger extinction correction for all uv derived values as proposed by steidel et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and others ( see figure  [ fig : madau ] ) .",
    "the sfr derived from the fir luminosity density may be an overestimate if the observed fir includes a significant contribution from dust heated by an agn or by interstellar radiation field .",
    "the frequency of the radio - excess objects in our sample is only about 1% , independent of luminosity . and the overall frequency of agns ( including radio - quiet ) may be as high as 10% if only one out of ten agns produces significant radio emission .",
    "some agn contribution to the total fir luminosity density is undoubtedly present , but it is nevertheless not likely to be dominant ( see  6.1 &  6.2 ) .",
    "the contribution from the dust heated by interstellar radiation field has been suggested previously to account for up to 50 to 70% of the fir luminosity ( see lonsdale - persson & helou 1987 , sauvage & thuan 1992 , xu & helou 1996 ) .",
    "this claim does not seem entirely consistent with our finding that an overwhelming majority of both the field and starburst galaxies obey the same linear radio - fir relation ( see  3 and  6.2 ) .",
    "a possible explanation may be that the cirrus is heated by non - ionizing uv photons from relatively massive stars , so that even the cirrus tracks the population of stars producing the radio emission ( xu 1990 ) .      the excellent linear correlation seen between the fir and radio luminosity among the iras",
    "2 jy sample offers a possibility of deriving the star formation rate directly from the measured radio luminosity .",
    "because of the significant scatter in the radio - fir relation and possible non - linear effects discussed in  3 , determining the star formation rate for any particular galaxy using its radio luminosity alone may be risky .",
    "the effect of the scatter is substantially reduced , however , when the radio lf is integrated over luminosity in deriving the radio luminosity density . further , the star formation density for a given volume can be determined with a greater accuracy if the integration is limited over the range of radio luminosity where the linear radio - fir relation is secure .    deriving the star - formation density from the radio continuum luminosity density for the general galaxy population also has to account for the possible contribution from radio agns .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : sumlf14 ] , the 1.4 ghz radio lf is dominated by the normal late type galaxies for @xmath172 w hz@xmath8 while the contribution by the  monsters \" becomes significant only at @xmath173 w hz@xmath8 .",
    "this bimodality is also clearly seen in the histogram of 1.4 ghz radio luminosity distribution for condon s ugc sample shown in figure  [ fig : l14histo ] . since the net agn contribution is small and quantitatively",
    "well understood for @xmath174 w hz@xmath8 , the star formation density for the local volume can be derived with some confidence from the radio luminosity density integrated up to this luminosity cutoff .",
    "the integrated 1.4 ghz luminosity density derived from the iras 2 jy sample for @xmath174 w hz@xmath8 is @xmath175 w hz@xmath8 mpc@xmath8 ( see figure  [ fig : sumlf14 ] ) .",
    "the empirical conversion relation that links this 1.4 ghz luminosity density to the local star formation density of @xmath7 yr@xmath8 is then @xmath176    as discussed in  6.4 , the main uncertainty in this relation comes from the estimate of the local star formation density . if the radio lf at a given epoch can be derived with sufficient accuracy , then the contribution by star forming galaxies and radio agns can be distinguished and the star formation density for the epoch can be derived using eq .  14 .",
    "whether the dividing line between the starburst and agn population near @xmath177 w hz@xmath8 is constant or evolved over time is unknown at the moment , and it needs to be investigated by future studies . ultimately , the cosmic star formation history free of any extinction effects may be derived using the radio emission from star forming galaxies and by tracking the evolution in their radio luminosity function .",
    "by cross - correlating the iras redshift survey catalog and the nrao vla sky survey database , we have assembled a flux - limited complete sample of 1809 iras detected galaxies .",
    "this iras 2 jy sample is 6 times larger in size and 5 times deeper in redshift coverage ( @xmath160 ) than previous studies of radio and infrared properties of galaxies .",
    "in addition to obtaining the accurate positions of these iras sources , we have examined the well known radio - fir correlation in detail .",
    "the principal conclusions from the analysis of the data are the following :    \\1 .",
    "the radio - fir correlation for the fir - selected galaxy sample is well described by a linear relation , and over 98% of the sample galaxies follow this linear radio - fir correlation .",
    "the scatter in the linear relation is about 0.26 in dex , dominated by small systematic deviations involving a small number of galaxies at high and low luminosity ends .",
    "a total of 23  radio - excess \" objects ( radio agns ) are found in our sample including three  radio - loud \" objects pks  1345 + 12 , 3c  273 , and ngc 1275 .",
    "the frequency of radio - excess objects in our iras 2 jy sample is 23/1809 = 1.3% , and radio - excess objects are rare among the fir - selected sample of normal and starburst galaxies .",
    "there are only 3 radio - excess objects among the 161 fir - luminous ( @xmath178 ) galaxies in the sample ( 3/161 = 1.9% ) .",
    "therefore the frequency of radio agns appears to be independent of fir luminosity .",
    "\\3 . the derived 1.4 ghz radio luminosity function and 60 @xmath3 m luminosity function for the iras 2 jy sample are both reasonably modeled as linear sums of two schechter functions , one representing late type field galaxies and the second representing a starburst population .",
    "the presence of the second , high luminosity component in these lfs is a predictable outcome of the elevated m / l associated with the starburst population , and the press - schechter formulation of the structure formation can now be naturally extended to the interpretation of the radio and infrared lfs as well .",
    "the radio - excess objects in our sample show evidence for the same highly enhanced radiation field as the infrared luminous galaxies in the infrared color - color diagrams . a systematic segregation of field galaxies , starburst galaxies , and radio agns is found in the mid - ir versus far - ir color - color diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig : color2 ] ) , where the radio agns show the largest observed @xmath144 ratios .",
    "the total fraction of radio - excess objects among the galaxies with mid - ir enhancement is only about 10% ( 2/20 )  similar to the frequency of radio - loud objects among the qsos .",
    "the absence of mid - ir enhancement and radio - excess among the large majority of the ir luminous galaxies suggests that star formation is the dominant energy source in most cases .",
    "a small number of infrared - excess objects are also identified by their departure from the radio - fir relation ( 9 objects with @xmath56 ) .",
    "both dust - enshrouded agns and compact starbursts can explain their observed properties , and distinguishing the two may be difficult . the observed spatial extents of 50 - 100 pc favors the starburst explanation .",
    "in either case , this phase must be brief , perhaps lasting only a few percent of the ir luminous phase since these infrared - excess objects are extremely rare .",
    "the integrated 60 @xmath3 m luminosity density between @xmath156 and @xmath157 is @xmath158 mpc@xmath5 .",
    "the fir - luminous galaxies ( @xmath6 ) contribute less than 10% of the total .",
    "the derived local fir luminosity density is @xmath4 mpc@xmath5 .",
    "the inferred _ extinction - free _ star - formation density for the local volume is @xmath7 yr@xmath8 mpc@xmath5 .",
    "the observed linear correlation between the fir and radio luminosities in the iras 2 jy sample offers a potentially useful method of deriving the star - formation rate using the measured radio luminosity density .",
    "a good separation found between star - forming galaxies and agns in the derived radio lf offers a promising possibility of tracing the evolution of the two populations separately by deriving their radio lfs at different epochs .    by examining the radio properties of a large sample of infrared selected galaxies",
    ", we have obtained a much better understanding of the extent of the radio - fir correlation .",
    "we have also obtained a good quantitative understanding of the frequency and energetic importance of active galactic nuclei among the infrared selected galaxies and outlined the practical limits on using the radio continuum as a direct probe of star forming activity .",
    "this study can now serve as the basis for conducting deep radio , ir / submm , and optical surveys aimed at mapping the extinction - free cosmic - star formation history and the evolution of radio agns .",
