    "the distinctive feature of quantum mechanics is discreteness .",
    "its scale on the atomic level is determined with the planck s constant @xmath0 . for example , the discrete values of measured projection of angular momentum of atom and spin differ on @xmath0 .",
    "discreteness in nanostrucrures may have much larger scale because of macroscopic quantum phenomena such as superconductivity . according to the bohr s quantization @xmath1 the difference of angular momentum @xmath2 between adjacent permitted states",
    ", @xmath3 and @xmath4 , of a free electron in a nano - ring with a radius @xmath5 equals @xmath0 as well as in atom .",
    "the energy difference @xmath6 is much smaller than in atom . because of the latter",
    "the persistent current , the quantum phenomenon observed because of the discreteness of spectrum , can be observed only at very low temperature in semiconductor and normal metal rings with realistic radius from @xmath7 [ 1 ] to @xmath8 [ 2 ] .",
    "this phenomena can not be practically observed in the ring with the radius @xmath9 .",
    "in contrast to the semiconductor and normal metal rings , in superconductor ring with such radius the persistent current is observed in the whole temperature region corresponding to the superconducting state @xmath10 and even in some region above it @xmath11 [ 3 ] .",
    "the energy difference @xmath12 between adjacent permitted states in superconductor ring in @xmath13 times higher [ 4 ] then in the non - superconductor one because of the same @xmath14 angular momentum of all @xmath15 superconducting pairs containing in the ring with the volume @xmath16 , the radius @xmath17 and the section area @xmath18 .",
    "the angular momentum difference between adjacent permitted states of superconductor rings with uniform section area @xmath18 increases also in @xmath13 times , @xmath19 .",
    "the density of pairs @xmath20 in superconducting state @xmath10 is equal in order of value 1/2 electron density in the metal .",
    "therefore the number @xmath13 is enormous in any ring with realistic size .",
    "the great discreteness may be useful for applications .",
    "nanostructures may be more useful for some applications because of too great discreteness of macroscopic superconductor structures . in order to the discreteness",
    "can be used it should become apparent in measurable parameters",
    ". a device measurable parameters of which is strongly discrete is proposed in this work .",
    "the enormous discreteness in superconductor is describe very well with the ginzburg - landau wave function @xmath21 . where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the density and the total number of superconducting pairs in the ring .",
    "but @xmath24 is canonical momentum of single pair with the charge @xmath25 . because of the requirement that the complex pair wave function closed in the loop must be single - valued at any its point @xmath26 the phase @xmath27 must change by integral multiples of @xmath28 @xmath29 following a complete turn along the path of integration @xmath30 . because of the quantization ( 1 ) and the relation @xmath31 the minimum value of the permitted velocity @xmath32 of superconducting pairs in a loop is periodic function of magnetic field @xmath33 with the period @xmath34 corresponding to the flux quantum @xmath35 inside the loop with the area @xmath36 .",
    "the two permitted states @xmath37 and @xmath38 have equal minimum energy @xmath39 at @xmath40 . because of the great number of pairs @xmath41 the energy difference between these states becomes high @xmath42 at small deviation @xmath43 of magnetic field value @xmath33 from @xmath44",

    "this jump can be observed as voltage @xmath53 jump at applying of an external current @xmath54 as shown on the figure . ]",
    "this change can be detected with help of the device , sketch of which is shown on fig.1 .",
    "the device consists of two superconductor loops @xmath55 and @xmath56 with equal area @xmath36 .",
    "the velocity of superconducting pairs in the loops @xmath57 and @xmath58 depends on the quantum numbers @xmath51 and @xmath52 , i.e. the phase @xmath27 change ( 1 ) at complete turn along each of the loops .",
    "the loops are connected with two josephson junctions in two points , as it is shown on fig.1 . according to the current - phase relationship @xmath59 between the super - current @xmath48 through the josephson junction and the phase difference @xmath60 between",
    "the junction boundaries the maximum value of the super - current @xmath61   \\eqno{(2)}\\ ] ] through two josephson junction should depend on the relation between the phase differences @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "according to the quantization relation ( 1 ) along the path of integration @xmath55 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 the value @xmath66 is determined only with the quantum numbers @xmath51 and @xmath52 , at any external magnetic field @xmath33 and the equal area @xmath36 of the loops .",

    "the change of the persistent current direction , for example , in the first loop at the change from @xmath71 to @xmath72 can be detected as the voltage @xmath73 jump , at an external current @xmath54 applied as shown on fig.1 .",
    "the voltage jump can mount up to the value @xmath74 [ 5 ] .",
    "for example , the maximum jump can equal @xmath75 in the case on niobium loops with the critical temperature @xmath76 .",
    "this jump may be observed at very weak variation @xmath43 of the external magnetic field @xmath33 .",
    "the energy @xmath77 difference between adjacent permitted states , for example @xmath78 and @xmath79 at @xmath80 , @xmath81 increases with the loop area @xmath36 and the amplitude @xmath82 of the oscillations @xmath83 .",
    "the value @xmath84 of the magnetic field variation , at which the probability @xmath85 $ ] of the @xmath79 state , for example , changes between 0 and 1 , decreases with the increase of the loop sizes , because of the relation @xmath86 .",
    "this value is enough low already in a loop with nano - size .",
    "for example , the persistent current amplitude @xmath87 observed in the aluminum ring with diameter @xmath88 and circumference section @xmath89 [ 6 ] corresponds to the value @xmath90 at @xmath91 .",
    "the jump from @xmath92 to @xmath93 should by observed with variation @xmath94 and @xmath95 at this value of the persistent current , @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "the magnetic flux variation @xmath98 can be induced with a current @xmath99 circulating in an additional loop with @xmath100 having the inductance @xmath101 [ 5 ] .",
    "the value of the switching current @xmath102 should not depend on the loop length @xmath30 , because of the proportionality @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "the loop with a small @xmath30 can be used as a bit , the two states @xmath78 and @xmath79 of which can be read in the way shown on fig.1 .",
    "the devise fig.1 with a large loop length @xmath105 can be used for measurement of very weak magnetic field @xmath106 .",
    "this very sensitive magnetometer has some advantages in comparison with the well known squid ( superconducting quantum interference devices ) [ 7 ] .",
    "the possibility of the voltage jump at the quantum number @xmath51 , @xmath52 change in one of the loop of the devise shown on fig.1 was corroborated experimentally in the work [ 8 ] .",
    "the voltage @xmath73 ( or the resistance @xmath107 measured in [ 8 ] ) changes by jump with magnetic field @xmath33 at the change of the persistent current direction , i.e. the @xmath51 number in one of the loop and returns to the initial value at the same change in the other loop .",
    "the quantum numbers @xmath51 and @xmath52 change in [ 8 ] at different magnetic field values because of different section @xmath18 of the loops . this circumstance may be used in the devise proposed in the present work .",
