    "protostellar objects are , in most cases , deeply embedded in molecular clouds and are enshrouded by heavy foreground extinction .",
    "this makes the very early stages of stellar gestation notoriously illusive  ( zinnecker & yorke 2007 ) . the birth of stars with masses above 10  m@xmath3 is particularly intriguing as their radiation is apparently sufficient to resist the accretion of gas and , hence , further mass growth unless somehow mitigated  ( mckee & tan 2002 ; behrend & maeder 2001 ) . evidence of potential disks and/or envelopes associated with massive star formation has been accumulated through various probes especially in the radio domain  ( chini et al .",
    "2004 ; patel et al . 2005 ) .",
    "however , the formation process of massive stars remains far from being resolved .",
    "the critical growth period of massive stars lasts only tens of thousand of years but is usually accompanied by spectacular ejections of gas in opposite directions . since such jets are circumstantial evidence of an accretion disk , it is possible and crucial to gain robust evidence of ongoing accretion associated with massive young stellar objects ( yso ) in their early stages of evolution .",
    "the rosette molecular complex ( rmc ) is a famous isolated massive star forming region with an extent of about 100 pc .",
    "it is located at a distance of @xmath0  1.39 kpc ( hensberge et al .",
    "2000 ) and harbors a gas reservoir of @xmath010@xmath4(blitz & thaddeus 1980 ) .",
    "new generation ob star formation is in evidence in the densest ridge of the complex ( li & smith , 2005 ) .",
    "the well known high - mass protostellar system afgl 961 is situated well within this region ( cohen 1973 ; grasdalen et al . 1983 ; castelaz et al . 1985 ; lenzen et al .",
    "1984 ; hodapp 1994 ) .",
    "the third component of the system , designated as afgl 961 ii ( li & smith 2005 ) , was first noticed to be associated with a small nebulosity by eiroa ( 1981 ) and later briefly discussed by hodapp ( 1994 ) .",
    "the nebulosity was considered as a cavity with a partial shell surrounding the central young star  ( aspin 1998 ; alvarez et al .",
    "however , the origin of the intriguing yso is far from clear .",
    "we obtained near - infrared images of the afgl 961 region as part of our program to explore the entire rosette star formation complex . the jhk and h@xmath5 data were obtained on december 19 - 20 , 2005 , with the sofi instrument ( moorwood , cuby & lidman 1998 ) on the eso new technology telescope at la silla in chile .",
    "the integration time is 2000s in the h@xmath5  10 s(1 ) and 300s in each of the j , h and ks bands .",
    "we also employed sofi to obtain broad ks - band spectroscopy .",
    "the hr grism at order 3 results in a medium spectral resolution of @xmath02200 over the wavelength range 2.00 - 2.30 @xmath6 m .",
    "a 0@xmath7.6 slit was used , cutting through both the exciting source and the bipolar shock structures at a position angle of 345@xmath8 ( north to east ) .",
    "four 300s exposures of the target source were taken , which was accompanied by a 300s exposure of the blank sky . a telluric standard star ( hip 1179 with a spectral type of a7v , perryman et al .",
    "1997 ) was observed right after the exposures of the target .",
    "the integration times are 3 x 60s for the standard star and 60s for the sky background .    near - infrared echelle spectra covering h@xmath5 1 - 0s(1 ) were obtained at the u.k . infrared telescope ( ukirt ) on september 18 , 2006 ut .",
    "the cooled grating spectrometer cgs4 ( mountain et al . 1990 ) was used , which employs a 256@xmath9256 pixel insb array and has a pixel scale of 0.41``@xmath90.88 '' ( 0.41 \" in the dispersion direction ) .",
    "a 2-pixel - wide slit was used which yields a velocity resolution of @xmath016  kms@xmath10 .",
    "an internal black - body lamp was used to flat - field each spectral image , before the sky frames were subtracted from each object frame .",
    "the coadded spectral images were then wavelength calibrated using sky lines in the sky frame .",
    "the overall velocity calibration is accurate to better than 6  kms@xmath10 , while velocity shifts between adjacent spectra observed along the same slit are accurate to within @xmath02  km s@xmath10 .",
    "finally , observations of hd42807 ( bs2208 ; g2v , v=6.22  mag ) obtained immediately before the data were used to correct for telluric absorption and to flux calibrate each spectral image .",
    "the afgl 961 system was observed on the night of 15 december 2006 with the kitt peak national observatory 4-meter telescope and the mosaic i camera ( muller et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the pixel scale is 0.258pixel@xmath10 .",
    "five 600s exposures were obtained in each of the h@xmath11 ( k1009 ) and h@xmath11 + 16nm/[sii ] ( k1013 ) filters .",
    "the median seeing in both filters is about 0.9 .",
    "the exposures were dithered so that the gaps between the ccds were filled during the stacking process .",
    "the data were reduced with the iraf mscred package in the standard manner .",
    "medium resolution spectroscopy of afgl 961 ii was performed on the night of 22 january 2006 with the 2.16 m telescope of the national astronomical observatory of the chinese academy of sciences ( naoc ) .",
    "an omr ( optomechanics rsearch inc . ) spectrograph and a tecktronix 1024 x 1024 ccd were used .",
    "a 50    mm@xmath10 grating and a 2 @xmath7 slit resulted in a two - pixel resolution of the spectra of 2.4   .",
    "the accuracy of the wavelength calibration allows sampling of velocities down to 20 km s@xmath10 .",
    "we resolve the nebulous yso , afgl 961  ii , with our data into distinctive structures .",
    "its spectacular appearance closely resembles a cat s eye in our nir colour - composite image ( fig .  1 ) and",
    "we thus refer to it as the rosette eye .",
    "it is composed of a bright young star at the center , an hourglass shaped diffuse nebula oriented at a position angle of 345 @xmath12 ( from north to east ) , and extensive molecular emission resembling bipolar shock structures on either side of the apparent central source .",
    "the molecular emission is the most prominent in the well - defined arc - like structures of the system .",
    "a faint star is also found in close proximity to the central star ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , but does not appear to be physically related to the excitation of the extended nebulosity .",
    "the spatial appearance of the eye , along with the detection of strong excesses in the near - infrared ( li & smith , 2005 ) , suggests the existence of an accretion disk in the perpendicular direction .    at a distance of 1.39 kpc ( hensberge et al .",
    "2000 ) , the arc structures arch over an hourglass shaped cavity with a physical scale of @xmath0  0.087 pc , which is in agreement with typical sizes of @xmath0 0.1  pc of massive star - forming clumps  ( kurtz , et al .",
    "2000 ; motte & andre 2001 ) . if we assume a molecular density of n@xmath13 = 10@xmath14 @xmath15 ( de pree et al .",
    "1998 , motte et al . 2001 , churchwell 2002 ) , a pre - stellar core of this size will harbor a gas reservoir of over 53.5 m@xmath3 and is rich enough to give birth to a 20  m@xmath3 ( li & smith 2005 ) infant star according to theoretical models  ( yorke & sonnhalter 2002 ) . the spatial appearance of the rosette eye in each of the observed bands is presented in fig .  2 , where we see a clear bipolar nebula in j , resembling an hourglass with an opening angle of about 60@xmath12 .",
    "an eye structure is superimposed ; the north - west arc is more distinctively attached to the end of the conical nebula than is the south - east arc .",
    "there is also diffuse scattered light marginally visible beyond the north - west arc .",
    "the conical nebula to the south - east possesses a sharp edge , suggesting the existence of high extinction in that direction .",
    "diffuse extensive emission extends further to the east , pointing toward the massive binary associated with afgl961 , probably a leakage of the stellar light over the cavity walls .",
    "the hourglass - shaped nebula is less prominent in the h , ks and h@xmath2 bands with the apparent opening angle reduced to about 45@xmath12 .",
    "the arc structure in the south - east , however , brightens remarkably as the wavelength increases .",
    "it is sharp and bright in the ks band image and is most prominent in the h@xmath2 narrow - band image .    in the optical narrow - band h@xmath11",
    ", the structure to the north - west resembles that observed in the j band but displays more diffuse and extended emission .",
    "the south - east lobe appears to be dominated by heavy extinction and is restricted to the eye structure .",
    "our mid - resolution optical spectroscopy of the exciting source shows very strong h@xmath11 emission ( ew=170 , fwhm=@xmath0500 km s@xmath10 ) .",
    "this , along with the broad br@xmath16 emission presented below , is a good indicator of youth as also seen in other massive ysos ( bunn et al .",
    "however , only marginal [ sii ] emission is detected from both the central yso and the photoionized nebula .",
    "the spectroscopy with a resolution of 1.0    pixel@xmath10 yields no velocity difference between the bipolar lobes .",
    "this suggests a low velocity of at most a few tens of km  s@xmath10 of the outflowing gas , in accord with the general properties of outflows associated with massive protostellar objects ( churchwell 2002 ; henning et al . , 2000 ) .",
    "given the optical spectroscopy results , the [ sii ] image closely represents continuum emission from the eye .",
    "the derived continuum - subtracted h@xmath11 emission shows a small hii region excited by the uv ionizing photons from the yso and faint net emission from the north - west arc , indicating marginal ionization in the shell .",
    "the small hii region is confined by the bipolar cavity , which is less than 0.1 pc in size . here",
    "the uv ionizing photons are attributed to shocked accretion from the proposed disk / envelope in the orthogonal direction , which feeds the yso continuously till the final dissipation of the circumstellar materials .",
    "the morphology of the eye matches well the transient phase in massive stellar evolution presented by keto 2007 , where an hourglass - shaped photon - dissipation region first forms before it evolves into a full - blown hii region .",
    "the excitation of the ionized nebula , however , suggests a spectral type earlier than b2 for the exciting star , commensurate with its position on the color - magnitude diagram in the nir ( li & smith 2005 ) .",
    "archived spitzer irac and mips imaging data on the afgl  961 region , which traces hot dust distribution , indicate that afgl961  ii , the exciting source of the eye , sits on the edge of a lane of dust with the highest extinction . the conical structure in the south - east encounters heavy dust extinction .",
    "this explains why the bipolar nebula is observed in the optical as a fan shaped nebula extending toward the north - west  ( li & smith 2005 ) .",
    "the mips 24  @xmath6 m imaging , on the other hand , indicates a dumbbell shaped nebula that encompasses the bipolar cavity detected in the nir , which is devoid of dust emission and implies the dissipation or evacuation of dust by the ionized flows . with a moderate extinction of @xmath0  7  mag ( li & smith 2005 ) and a favorable viewing angle , we propose that afgl961  ii represents a spectacular case of a massive star visible in its early stage of formation .",
    "strong h@xmath2 line emission often arises after collisional excitation within shock waves in association with mass ejections from extremely young stars .",
    "this usually yields relatively high radial velocities and strong excitation of the lower vibrational levels . to test this hypothesis",
    ", we performed deep ks band spectroscopy with a slit position cutting through both the arc structures and the central yso .",
    "the spectrum of the exciting source shows br@xmath16 ( ew=10.8 , fwhm=29 ) superimposed on a featureless rising continuum towards longer wavelengths .",
    "however , the h@xmath2 emission from the shell displays no sign of collisional excitation .",
    "line emission originates from very high vibrational levels of h@xmath5 ( fig .  3 , upper panel ) .",
    "the highest level present is the 97  q(3 ) at 2.100@xmath6 m , originating 42,462k above the ground state .",
    "the spectroscopic data demonstrate distinctly that the gas is purely fluoresced with the h@xmath5 line strengths corresponding exactly to an energy level cascade .",
    "this , however , is in agreement with theoretical predictions that uv pumped fluorescence should be a common phenomenon , especially on surfaces of molecular clumps illuminated by young massive stars  ( gatley 1987 ) .",
    "afgl961  ii thus represents the first detection of pure fluorescent radiation directly associated with massive protostellar objects .",
    "the fluorescence origin of the line emission is confirmed by our simulation based on the observed line flux ratios ( smith , li & gredel et al . in prep . ) .",
    "furthermore , the echelle spectrogram obtained by ukirt discloses no radial velocity motion in the shell to the limits of our measurements ( @xmath0  6  kms@xmath10 ) ( fig .  3 , lower panel ) .",
    "this study substantiates that the exciting source of the rosette eye , afgl 961 ii , has just finished its original collapse , that uv radiation from shocked massive accretion has recently turned on and that ionized stellar winds have begun to emerge in the polar directions . the shell left by",
    "the original collapse is now prepared to face the uv ionization from the newly born star .",
    "we suggest that the eye may closely correspond to a transient phase immediately preceding that of the famous orion omc-1 outflow  ( stone et al .",
    "1995 ) . in this scenario ,",
    "the arcs will be subjected to fluid instabilities as an ensuing fast wind of low density emerges , which leads to the so - called fireworks as the shell gas is driven out in the form of dense bullets  ( mccaughrean & mac low , 1997 ) .",
    "the results presented in this paper corroborate the recent onset of the formation of a massive star in the ridge of the rmc , which is in a key transient phase of its emergence from the natal cloud and the development of the hii region .",
    "we are grateful to the referee , robert gehrz , for the many helpful comments and suggestions made .",
