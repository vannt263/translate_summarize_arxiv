    "since these subjects were adequately covered in the meeting , i decided to focus on a different topic that did not receive much attention in this meeting but is likely to become increasingly important in the coming decade .",
    "merging ns binaries have been studied since 1970s , with major activities in the relativity community since the early 1990s because of their importance as a source of gravitational waves ( gws ) ( e.g. cutler et al .",
    "they are of great current interest for two reasons : ( i ) merging ns / ns or ns / black - hole ( bh ) binaries have been identified as the leading candidate for the central engine of short grbs ( berger 2011 ) .",
    "they are also expected to produce optical and radio transients that may be detected by wide - field , fast imaging telescopes that are coming online ( e.g. ptf , lsst ) in the next few years ( nissanke et al .",
    "( ii ) after several decades of developmemt and promise , gravitational wave astronomy in the hz - khz band may finally take off in the next decade .",
    "the initial ligo reached the design sensitivity ( @xmath0 ) in 2006 , and the enhanced ligo ( with a factor of 2 reduction in @xmath1 ) is taking or analysing data .",
    "the advanced ligo and virgo are expected to begin observations in 2015 and reach full sensitivity ( a factor of 10 reduction in @xmath1 ) in 2018 - 19  at which time the detection of gws from many merging ns binaries seems guaranteed .",
    "the last three minutes of a ns binary s life may be divided into two phases : the inspiral phase , producing quasi - periodic gws , and the coalescence phase , where physical collision results in `` messy '' gws .",
    "the recent years , 3d simulations of the final merger in full general relativity ( gr ) have become possible ( see shibata & taniguchi 2006 ; foucart et at .  2012 ; sekiguchi et al .",
    "it has long been recognized that the final merger waveforms can provide a useful probe of ns equation of state ( eos ; e.g. , cutler et al .  1993 ; bildsten & cutler 1992 ; lai & wiseman 1996 ; wiggins & lai 2000 ) .",
    "the idea is simple : by measuring the `` cut - off '' frequency @xmath2 associated with binary contact or tidal disruption , combined with the precise mass measurement from the inspiral waveform , one can obtain the ns radius ( see bauswein et al .",
    "2012 for recent simulations which put such a idea into concrete footing ; see also sekiguchi et al .",
    "2012 ; faber & rasio 2012 for reviews ) .    in the following sections i will focus on the pre - merger phase",
    "prior to binary merger , tidal effects may affect the orbital decay and the gws .",
    "there are two types of tides : _ equilibrium tides _ and _ dynamical tides_. the equilibrium tides correspond to global deformation of the ns , which leads to the interaction potential between the two stars ( with the ns mass @xmath3 and radius @xmath4 , the companion mass @xmath5  treated as a point mass , and the binary separation @xmath6 ) v(r)=-mm/a - o(k_2m^2r^5/a^6 ) , where @xmath7 is the so - called love number . this would lead to a correction to the number of gw cycles , @xmath8 $ ] . for a newtonian polytropic ns model ,",
    "simple analytic expressions can be found in lai et al .",
    "recent semi - analytic gr calculations of such equilibrium tidal effects ( including the more precise determination of the love number ) can be found in numerous papers ( e.g. , flanagan & hinderer 2008 ; binnington & poisson 2009 ; damour & nagar 2009 ; penner et al .",
    "2012 , ferrari et al .",
    "obviously this effect is only important at small orbital separations ( just prior to merger )  there is some prospect of measuring this , thereby constraining the eos , but it may be challenging ( damour et al .",
    "2012 ) . at small orbital separations ,",
    "the quadrupole approximation is not valid ; therefore one must use the numerically computed gr quasi - equilibrium binary sequences to characterize the tidal effect ",
    "such sequences have been constructed by several groups since the 1990s ( e.g. , baumgarte et al .",
    "1998 ; uryu et al .  2009 ) or use fully numerical simulations .    another aspect of the equilibrium tide concerns tidal dissipation , which leads to a lag of the tidal bulge with respect to the binary axis .",
    "it was shown already in the 1990s ( bildsten & cutler 1992 ; kochanek 1992 ) that because of the rapid gw - driven orbital decay , viscous tidal lag can not synchronize the ns spin .",
    "thus the ns will be close to irrotational ( approximated as a riemann - s ellipsoid ; lai et al .",
    "1994 ; wiggins & lai 2000 ; ferrari et al .",
    "2012 ) . near the final phase of the inspiral , the rapid orbital decay gives rise to a finite lag angle ( even with zero viscosity ) , but",
    "this can not synchronize the ns ( lai & shapiro 1995 ; dallosso & rossi 2012 ) .",
    "the situation is more complicated for * dynamical tides * , which manifest as resonant excitations of internal oscillations of the ns : as two nss spiral in , the orbit can momentarily come into resonance with the normal modes ( frequency @xmath9 ) of the ns : _ = m_orb , m=2,3,by drawing energy from the orbital motion and resonantly exciting the modes , the rate of inspiral is modified , giving rise to a phase shift in the gravitational waveform",
    ". this problem was studied by reisenegger & goldreich ( 1994 ) , lai ( 1994 ) and shibata ( 1994 ) in the case of non - rotating nss , where the only modes that can be resonantly excited are g - modes ( with typical mode frequencies@xmath10  hz ) .",
    "it was found that the effect is small for typical ns parameters ( mass @xmath11 and radius @xmath12  km ) because the coupling between the g - mode and the tidal potential is weak . ho & lai ( 1999 ) studied the effect of ns rotation , and found that the g - mode resonance can be strongly enhanced even by a modest rotation ( e.g. , the phase shift in the waveform @xmath13 reaches up to 0.1  radian for a spin frequency @xmath14  hz ) .",
    "they also found that for a rapidly rotating ns ( @xmath15  hz ) , f - mode resonance becomes possible ( since the inertial - frame f - mode frequency can be significantly reduced by rotation ) and produces a large phase shift .",
    "in addition , ns rotation gives rise to r - mode resonance whose effect is appreciable only for very rapid ( near breakup ) rotations .",
    "lai & wu ( 2006 ) further studied resonant excitations of other inertial modes ( of which r - mode is a member ) and found similar effects .",
    "flanagan & racine ( 2006 ) studied the gravitomagnetic resonant excitation of r - modes and and found that the post - newtonian effect is more important than the newtonian tidal effect ( and that the phase shift reaches 0.1  radian for @xmath16  hz ) .",
    "tsang et al .  ( 2012 ) examined crustal modes and found that the gw phase correction is small / modest and suggested that tidal resonance could shatter the ns crust , giving rise to the pre - cursor of short grbs .",
    "taken together , these studies suggest that for canonical ns parameters ( @xmath17  km , @xmath14  hz ) , tidal resonances have a small effect on the gravitational waveform during binary inspiral .",
    "however , it is important to keep in mind that the effect is a strong function of @xmath4 ( e.g. , @xmath18 for g - modes and @xmath19 for inertial modes ) . a larger radius",
    "( @xmath20  km ) , appropriate for stiff eos , would make the effect important . in the case of g - modes ,",
    "the magnitude of the effect depends on the symmetry energy of nuclear matter and could be non - negligible ( w. newton & d. lai 2013 , in prep ) .",
    "for magnetic nss , magnetic interactions may play a role .",
    "if the binary is embedded in a vacuum , then the interaction potential is @xmath21 ( where @xmath22 are the magnetic dipole moments of the two stars ) .",
    "it is easy to check that such magnetic interaction would lead to negligible effect on the gws unless both nss have superstrong fields ( @xmath23  g )  this is unlikely ( e.g. , the double pulsars psr j0737 - 3039 has @xmath24  g for pulsar a and @xmath25 for pulsar b ) .        of course , as in the case of isolated pulsars , the circumbinary environment can not be vacuum .",
    "the following discussion is based on lai ( 2012 ) .",
    "consider a binary system consisting of a magnetic ns ( the `` primary '' , with mass @xmath3 , radius @xmath4 , spin @xmath26 , and magnetic dipole moment @xmath27 ) and a non - magnetic companion ( mass @xmath28 , radius @xmath29 ) .",
    "the orbital angular frequency is @xmath30 .",
    "the magnetic field strength at the surface of the primary is @xmath31 .",
    "the whole binary system is embedded in a tenuous plasma ( magnetosphere ) . we assume for simplicity that @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are all aligned .",
    "the motion of the non - magnetic companion relative to the magnetic field of the primary produces an emf @xmath35 , where @xmath36 , with @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "this gives @xmath39 , where @xmath40 .",
    "the emf drives a current along the magnetic field lines in the magnetosphere , connecting the primary and the companion through two flux tubes .",
    "the current in the circuit is given by @xmath41 , where the total resistance of the circuit is @xmath42 , with @xmath43 the resistances of the magnetic star , the companion and the magnetosphere , respectively .",
    "these resistances depend on the properties of the binary components and the magnetosphere , and can vary widely for different types of systems .",
    "the energy dissipation rate of the system is then @xmath44 , where the factor of 2 accounts for both the upper and lower sides of the circuit .",
    "the total magnetic force ( in the azimuthal direction ) on the companion is @xmath45 , with @xmath46 .",
    "thus the torque acting on the binary s orbital angular momentum is @xmath47 .",
    "the torque on the primary s spin is @xmath48 ( where @xmath49 is the moment of inertia ) .",
    "the orbital energy loss rate associated with @xmath50 is then @xmath51 .",
    "the equations above show that the binary interaction torque and energy dissipation associated with the dc circuit increase with decreasing total resistance @xmath52 .",
    "is there a problem for the dc model when @xmath52 is too small ?",
    "the answer is yes .",
    "the current in the circuit produces a toroidal magnetic field , which has the same magnitude but opposite direction above and below the equatorial plane .",
    "the toroidal field just above the companion star ( in the upper flux tube ) is @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the ( height - integrated ) surface current .",
    "thus the azimuthal twist of the flux tube is @xmath55 , where @xmath56 . clearly , when @xmath52 is less than @xmath57 , the flux tube will be highly twisted .",
    "goldreich & lynden - bell ( 1969 ) speculated that the dc circuit would break down when the twist is too large .",
    "( for the jupiter - io system parameters , the twist @xmath58 . )",
    "numerous works have since confirmed that this is indeed the case . theoretical studies and numerical simulations , usually carried out in the contexts of solar flares and accretion disks , have shown that as a flux tube is twisted beyond @xmath59 , the magnetic pressure associated with @xmath60 makes the flux tube expand outward and the magnetic fields open up , allowing the system to reach a lower energy state ( e.g. , aly 1985 ; lynden - bell & boily 1994 ; lovelace et al .",
    "1995 ; uzdensky et al .",
    "thus , a dc circuit with @xmath59 can not be realized : the flux tube will break up , disconnecting the linkage between the two binary components .",
    "a binary system with @xmath61 can not establish a steady - state dc circuit .",
    "the electrodynamics is likely rather complex , only a quasi - cyclic circuit may be possible ( lai 2012 ; see aly & kuijpers 1990 ) : ( a ) the magnetic field from the primary penetrates part of the companion , establishing magnetic linkage between the two stars ; ( b ) the linked fields are twisted by differential rotation , generating toroidal field from the linked poloidal field ; ( c ) as the toroidal magnetic field becomes comparable to the poloidal field , the fields inflate and the flux tube breaks , disrupting the magnetic linkage ; ( d ) reconnection between the inflated field lines relaxes the shear and restore the linkage . the whole cycle repeats .    in general , we can use the dimensionless azimuthal twist @xmath62 to parameterize the magnetic torque and energy dissipation rate : t= 12ar_c^2b_zb_+ = -_,e_diss = -t = _ .",
    "[ eq : emax]the maximum torque and dissipation are obtained by setting @xmath63 . if the quasi - cyclic circuit discussed in the last paragraph is established , we would expect @xmath62 to vary between @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "note that in the above , @xmath50 is negative since we are assuming @xmath66 .",
    "gravitational wave ( gw ) emission drives the orbital decay of the ns binary , with timescale @xmath67 , where we have adopted @xmath11 and mass ratio @xmath68 .",
    "the magnetic torque tends to spin up the primary when @xmath30@xmath69@xmath26 .",
    "spin - orbit synchronization is possible only if the synchronization time @xmath70 is less than @xmath71 at some orbital radii . with @xmath72 ,",
    "we find t_syn=2(1+q ) _",
    "( ) ( ) ^2 210 ^ 7_^-1 ( ) ^-2(a30km)^7/2s , [ eq : tsyn]where on the right we have adopted @xmath73 and @xmath74  km",
    ". clearly , even with magnetar - like field strength ( @xmath75  g ) and maximum efficiency ( @xmath63 ) , spin - orbit synchronization can not be achieved by magnetic torque .",
    "for the same reason , the effect of magnetic torque on the number of gw cycles during binary inspiral is small .",
    "the energy dissipation rate is e_diss=_()b_^2r^6 r_c^2c2a^6 = 7.410 ^ 44_()^2()^-13/2 ^-1 , where on the right we have used @xmath76 ( for @xmath77 ) and adopted canonical parameters ( @xmath78 , @xmath74  km ) .",
    "the total energy dissipation per @xmath79 is = e_disst_gw 8.910 ^ 42_()^2(a30km)^-5/2 .",
    "some fraction of this dissipation will emerge as electromagnetic radiation counterpart of binary inspiral .",
    "it is possible that this radiation is detectable at extragalactic distance . but",
    "this will depend on the microphysics in the magnetosphere , including particle acceleration and radiation mechanism ( e.g. , vietri 1996 ; hansen & lyutikov 2001 ) .",
    "if one assumes that the magnetosphere resistance is given by the impedance of free space , @xmath80 , then the corresponding twist is @xmath81 , which satisfies our upper limit .",
    "we then have e_diss=()^2 = 1.710 ^ 44()^2 ( a30km)^-7erg / s .",
    "this is in agreement with the estimate of lyutikov ( 2011 ) .",
    "the situation is similar for ns / bh binaries . in the membrane paradigm ( thorne et al .",
    "1986 ) , a bh of mass @xmath82 resembles a sphere of radius @xmath83 ( neglecting bh spin ) and impedance @xmath84 . neglecting the resistances of the magnetosphere and the ns , the azimuthal twist of the flux tube in the dc circuit is @xmath85 , which satisfies our upper limit .",
    "the energy dissipation rate is ( cf .",
    "lyutikov 2011 ; mcwilliams & levin 2011 ) e_diss=()^2 5.7 10 ^ 42()^2 ( ) ^-4 ( ) ^-7 ^ -1 , where we have assumed @xmath86 .",
    "again , it is uncertain whether this radiation is detectable for binaries at extragalactic distances ."
