    "in the last few years the study of inelastic electron scattering mechanisms in mesoscopic metallic systems has attracted considerable interest both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "the motivation is to identify the mechanisms responsible for destroying the quantum coherence of the quasiparticles . in one kind of the experiments the dephasing time",
    "is determined from measurements of magnetoresistance @xcite , universal conductance fluctuation @xcite , and aharonov - bohm oscillation in mesoscopic rings in magnetic fields @xcite . in the other kind of experiments on short wires with large bias voltage",
    "the non - equilibrium distribution functions of the electron energies are measured @xcite which provides an indirect information about the energy relaxation of the electrons .",
    "the dephasing and energy relaxation are due to inelastic scattering processes , thus we can obtain information on those from these two kinds of experiments .",
    "the experiments were performed at very low temperatures ( below about @xmath3k ) where the electron - phonon scattering is weak , thus the main inelastic processes are the electron - electron scattering and the scatterings by dynamical defects ( e.g. magnetic impurities , two - level systems ) .    in this paper",
    "we investigate theoretically the energy relaxation due to magnetic impurities in thin metallic wires with large bias voltage .",
    "our motivation is that there are many cases where deviations from the expectations of the theory of coulomb electron - electron interaction by altshuler , aronov and coworkers @xcite were found .",
    "the saclay group @xcite analyzing the experimental data suggested a phenomenological anomalous effective energy relaxation rate proportional to @xmath0 where @xmath2 is the energy transfer . that differs from the one due to the coulomb interaction which varies like @xmath1 .",
    "that anomalous relaxation rate was attributed to the presence of magnetic impurities either implanted or contained by the starting material as contamination or dynamical defects @xcite .",
    "the main goal of our earlier paper @xcite has been to suggest a resolution of the discrepancy concerning the required magnetic impurity concentrations to fit the different experimental data and in some cases those discrepancies may reach the level of two orders of magnitude .",
    "therefore , even the role of magnetic impurities was questioned in spite of the observed sensitivity on external magnetic field @xcite .",
    "having a thin wire the magnetic surface anisotropy @xcite has been taken into account in ref .   which hinders the motion of the spin and in that way reduces the kondo scattering .",
    "the previous theoretical works @xcite , however , showed the phenomena is rather complex and it is very hard to separate and identify the role of the different effects .",
    "that is especially valid for the non - crossing approximation which is based on extensive numerical work @xcite and many details are hidden .",
    "the present paper is devoted to those problems , and the role of surface anisotropy has already been discussed in ref .  .",
    "considering the kondo effect the different temperature and energy ranges have very different characters .",
    "below the characteristic kondo energy the fermi liquid behavior is recovered .",
    "that range has been intensively studied even in the non - equilibrium situation in case of wires , but the situation in quantum dots shows strong similarities @xcite .",
    "the most difficult range is around the kondo energy , while well above that perturbative approaches are appropriate , known as logarithmic approximation .",
    "the main idea is to apply perturbation theory and to collect the terms with the highest power of the characteristic logarithm in each order . that leading logarithmic approach is well established .",
    "it will be shown that most of the experiments fall in that range .    in case of non - equilibrium situation",
    "the voltage applied on the short wire plays crucial role which has to be incorporated into that scheme .",
    "the applied voltage @xmath4 occurs in two different ways :    \\(i ) _ reduction of the kondo temperature _ : in a short wire in the diffusive limit with a weak energy relaxation the electron comes from one of the two contacts without energy loss .",
    "the distribution of those electrons is characterized by different fermi energies which are split by the applied voltage , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the electronic charge .",
    "the kondo effect arises from those regions where there are sharp changes in the energy distribution functions , thus at the two fermi energies . at both places",
    "separate kondo resonances develop , but the amplitudes of sharp changes in the distribution at both energies are reduced compared to the equilibrium case , where the change is the sum of those two .",
    "therefore , in the wire the equilibrium kondo temperature for the step with e.g. the lower energy is reduced at position @xmath7 as @xcite @xmath8 which is valid for @xmath9 where @xmath7 is measured in the units of the length of the wire @xmath10 . the voltage @xmath4 measures the energy range where the non - equilibrium electron distribution takes place .",
    "that reduction in @xmath11 can be very essential , e.g. for @xmath12k , @xmath13mev@xmath14k , and @xmath15 , @xmath16k .",
    "thus for a considerable voltage and for kondo temperature in a typical range ( @xmath17k ) the reduced kondo temperature is rather small compared to the energy scale @xmath5 playing role in the electronic transport . that ensures the applicability of the logarithmic approach as far as @xmath18 .",
    "in other cases , e.g. the non - crossing approximation must be applied @xcite .",
    "\\(ii ) _ enhanced korringa relaxation rate _ : the korringa relaxation @xcite describes the impurity spin relaxation due to electron - hole creations .",
    "the creation of those with almost zero energy can be only in the energy range where the sharp single - step ( @xmath19 ) electron distribution is modified .",
    "that can be achieved by raising the temperature or applying the voltage . in the latter case",
    "the extra relaxation rate is @xmath20 at @xmath19 where @xmath21 is the spin of the impurity and @xmath22 is the dimensionless electron - impurity spin coupling . in the equilibrium case",
    "the korringa relaxation rate is not part of the logarithmic approach , but @xmath23 makes it non - negligible .",
    "namely , in the next to leading logarithmic approximation the real part of the pseudospin particle self - energy contains a single log which is even lost in the imaginary part . that log is not contained by the simple logarithmic approach .",
    "the effect of the imaginary part ( the inverse lifetime of the spin ) remains , however , very crucial . for spins",
    "there are different relaxation rates e.g. the @xmath24 and @xmath25 in the esr , nmr experiments .",
    "the actual values are consequences of a delicate balance between the self - energy and vertex corrections , which can modify the prefactors like @xmath26 in eq .",
    "( [ korr_eq ] ) @xcite .",
    "cancellation of that type are very well known in the scaling equation of the renormalized effective coupling , where the value of the spin @xmath21 drops out @xcite .",
    "considering the paramagnetic impurity electron - spin resonance that has been discussed earlier in detail @xcite and it is found that in the @xmath25 relaxation rate the factor @xmath27 drops out .",
    "thus the prefactor @xmath26 in eq .",
    "( [ korr_eq ] ) may result in an essential overestimation for @xmath28 .",
    "a systematic study of that problem is not known in the present non - equilibrium situation @xcite .",
    "therefore , the consequences of the present ambiguity is only demonstrated by introducing a multiplying factor @xmath29 of order of unity ( @xmath30 ) for the relaxation rate given by eq .",
    "( [ korr_eq ] ) and the role of @xmath29 will be discussed .",
    "it is reasonable to assume , that the factor @xmath29 imitating those cancellations is more important for larger spins @xmath31 .    in the following the logarithmic approach",
    "is applied for the non - equilibrium case , and the anomalous korringa relaxation is additionally built in .",
    "considering the theoretical methods two ways can be followed : ( i ) the keldysh green function technique devoted to the non - equilibrium @xcite which may be combined with the non - crossing approximation @xcite .",
    "( ii ) direct calculation of the scattering rate by the time ordered perturbation theory starting with an arbitrary state and taking into account the actual distributions in the occupations of the intermediate and final states @xcite .",
    "restricting to logarithmic accuracy the second method is very easy to apply , in other cases one should turn to the first one .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec:2 ]",
    "the transport phenomenon is imposed . in section [ sec:3 ] the kernel in transport equation due to the magnetic impurity mediated electron - electron scattering is determined using the leading logarithmic approximation .",
    "the electron distribution and exchange coupling renormalization is carried out in a self - consistent way . in section [ sec:4 ] the korringa relaxation is taken into account in the kernel and in the smearing of the renormalized coupling , and then it is also determined in a self - consistent way with the other quantities . in section [ sec:5 ]",
    "the results are analyzed from the point of view of the importance of the different ingredients of the theory . in the conclusion",
    "the results obtained are summarized also from the point of view of ref .  , where the simplified method is applied for the case where the magnetic surface anisotropy @xcite is included .",
    "in the experiments the distribution of electron energies in a wire with large bias was measured at different position by attaching extra tunnel junction to the side of the wire ( see fig .  [ fwire ] ) . according to that we consider a wire with length @xmath10 and the distribution function at position @xmath7 in the wire in units of @xmath10 for energy @xmath32 and at time @xmath33",

( [ eq : freesol ] ) ) and after at each step of the iteration the collision integral is calculated from the actual distribution function and scattering rate and then the new distribution function satisfying the boundary conditions is determined .",
    "the variables @xmath7 and @xmath32 are discretized usually in 20 - 60 points .",
    "the number of the necessary iterations depends on the approximations used in the calculation of the collision integral , but usually the final solution is reached by 20 - 120 iteration .    for electron - electron interaction the scattering rate @xmath44",

    "the distribution function at position @xmath7 is a function of the energy @xmath32 and voltage bias @xmath4 and it is a functional of the self - consistently determined coupling @xmath137 , thus it can be written as @xmath138 .",

    "there is no difference in the leading logarithmic order as the channel index silently follows the continuous electron line .",
    "the first differences occur in the next approximation as closed electron loops appear where summation is required with respect to the channel index , thus the korringa relaxation and the vertex corrections are multiplied by the number of channels . as it has been discussed previously no drastic effects can be expected .",
    "there is an other drawback of the application of the logarithmic approximation in the leading order as that overestimates the kondo temperature by missing the prefactor @xmath144 . in general the contribution of the next to leading logarithmic approximation",
    "can be essential , but only nearby the kondo temperature .",
    "the korringa broadening reduces also that effect by reducing the averaged coupling @xmath106 . on the other hand",
    "if the kondo temperature is comparable with the applied voltage , then the effective kondo temperature is less reduced , thus the present method can not be applied @xcite .    in the present scheme",
    "the kernel of the effective magnetic impurity induced electron - electron interaction is determined .",
    "that kernel is governed by the singularity @xmath0 in the energy transfer and the less singular cross term results only in minor changes . for determination of the distribution function a completely self - consistent calculation",
    "is carried out where in the framework of the `` poor man s '' version of the renormalization group the couplings are modified by reducing the bandwidth which also modifies the korringa rate and the electron distribution function .",
    "for an arbitrary set of the parameters the distribution function can be determined using the method developed for the weak coupling limit , where @xmath11 is small compared to the applied voltage .",
    "the relative importance of the different ingredients can be judged as the method is applied step by step . in the present formulation some details could be easier followed , than e.g. in the non - crossing approximation which is more powerful but many details are buried by the huge machinery .    considering the comparison with the experiments an essential dilemma has been earlier realized . the required impurity concentration to fit the experiments in case of spin @xmath145 magnetic impurities is in good accordance with values obtained by the other experiments determining the dephasing time . in contrary , the cases with presumable integer spins show drastic discrepancies .",
    "the dephasing requires sometimes less than one hundred of the impurity concentration and that was attributed to the surface anisotropy @xcite in ref .  .",
    "the revised version of the form of the surface anisotropy @xcite makes the effect on the electron distribution much weaker , due to its smaller amplitude at larger distances measured from the surface . as in ref .",
    "it is shown that the surface anisotropy has weak effect on the shape of the distribution , thus the reduced number of impurities with large anisotropy very likely can not change the distribution in an essential way .    concidering the dephasing rate , that effect may , however , be stronger , as the relevant energy range of the electrons is much smaller , as the applied voltage @xmath5 is replaced by the temperature ( @xmath146 ) .",
    "thus , for more impurities , the anisotropy can dominate over the thermal energy , and the dephasing rate can be more reduced .",

    "<S> those steps are , however , broadened due to the energy relaxation which is relatively weak if only coulomb electron - electron interaction is assumed . in some of the experiments the broadening is more essential reflecting an anomalous energy relaxation rate proportional to @xmath0 instead of @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the energy transfer . </S>",
    "<S> later it has been suggested that such relaxation rate can be due to electron - electron interaction mediated by kondo impurity which is , as it is known since a long time , singular in @xmath2 . in the present paper </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic impurity mediated interaction is systematically studied in the logarithmic approximation valid above the kondo temperature . in the case of large applied bias voltage kondo resonances </S>",

    "<S> that smears the kondo resonances , and the renormalized coupling can be replaced by a smooth but essentially enhanced average coupling and that enhancement can reach the value 8 - 10 . </S>",
    "<S> thus the experimental data can be described by formulas without logarithmic kondo corrections , but with enhanced coupling . in certain regions of large bias , that averaged coupling depends weakly on the bias . in those cases the distribution function depends only on the ratio of the electron energy and the bias , showing scaling behavior . </S>",
    "<S> the impurity concentrations estimated from those experiments and other dephasing experiments can be very different . </S>",
    "<S> an earlier paper has been devoted to provide a possible explanation for that by considering the surface spin anisotropy due to strong spin - orbit interaction in the host which can hinder the motion of spins with integer spin value . </S>"
