    "the origin of the large scale magnetic fields observed in galaxies and clusters of galaxies is an open issue of great importance in modern astrophysics ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "primordial magnetic fields ( pmf ) generated in the early universe could have been the seeds for large scale magnetic fields and have left an imprint in the anisotropy pattern of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "a primordial hypothesis for generating the seeds amplified afterwards by adiabatic compression and dynamo - can not be discarded @xcite , also in light of recent observations of strong magnetic fields in galaxies at high redshift @xcite .",
    "pmf with a comoving amplitude of several ng can leave interesting imprints on cmb anisotropies .",
    "a stochastic background of pmf is modelled as a fully inhomogeneous component and its energy momentum tensor ( emt ) - quadratic in the magnetic fields - is considered at the same footing as linear inhomogeneities in the other components and linear metric fluctuations .",
    "a stochastic background of pmf generates independent modes for all kinds of linear perturbations : there has been several studies for scalar @xcite , vector @xcite and tensor @xcite perturbations .",
    "@xcite for studies which take into account all the types of contributions .",
    "a stochastic background of pmf affects also the statistics of cmb anisotropies , and not only its power spectra : being quadratic in the magnetic field amplitude , the emt is non - gaussian distributed @xcite and therefore the bispectrum of cmb anisotropies can also be a useful probe @xcite .    in our previous works",
    "@xcite we have refined the computation of cmb anisotropies in presence of a stochastic background of pmf : we have computed the initial conditions for cosmological perturbations in the radiation era keeping into account only relativistic degrees of freedom and the correlators for the fourier transforms of the emt in presence of a sharp cut - off which mimics the damping scale due to viscosity @xcite for few values of the spectral index @xmath0 of the stochastic background .    in this paper",
    "we use and extend the above theoretical description to derive the cmb constraints on a stochastic background of pmf which can be obtained by current and future data .",
    "we therefore use a modified version of ` cosmomc ` @xcite connected with a modified version of ` camb ` @xcite containing all the above features to constrain @xmath1 - the amplitude of the magnetic field smoothed over a comoving scale @xmath2 - and @xmath0 with the most recent compilation of cmb anisotropies data , therefore updating previous investigations @xcite .",
    "we also forecast the planck @xcite capabilities in constraining such a background of pmf .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we present the theoretical set - up needed for deriving the cmb constraints . as new results we give an approximation for the pmf energy - momentum valid for any @xmath0",
    ", we discuss the correlator between the energy density and the lorentz force and we extend the regular initial conditions for cosmological perturbations in the relativistic regime in presence of a stochastic background of pmf @xcite including the correction due to matter , collecting the details in appendix a , b and c , respectively . in section iii we discuss the constraints from wmap 7 years data @xcite , acbar @xcite , bicep @xcite and quad @xcite on a flat @xmath6cdm model plus a stochastic background of pmf .",
    "we present the planck capabilities in constraining @xmath7 and @xmath0 in section iv and we summarize our results in section v.",
    "a stochastic background of pmf acts as a fully inhomogeneous source to the einstein equations . as usual , we assume the infinite conductivity limit in which the pmf simply scales with time as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the scale factor normalized to @xmath10 today and @xmath11 is the conformal time . we model pmf with a power - law spectrum @xmath12 .",
    "the two point correlation function for inhomogeneous fields is : b_i(*k * ) b_j^*(*k*)=(2)^3 ( * k*-*k* ) ( _ ij - k_ik_j ) where @xmath13 to avoid infrared singularities .",
    "magnetic perturbations survive the silk damping but on smaller scales pmf are damped by radiation viscosity .",
    "we model this damping introducing a sharp cut off in the spectrum at a damping scale @xmath14 @xcite which is much smaller than the silk scale .",
    "to parametrize pmf amplitude , we choose to use the most common convention which smooths the magnetic fields with a gaussian filter over a comoving scale @xmath2 : b^2_=",
    "_ 0^ e^-k^2 ^2 p_b ( k ) = ( ) [ gaussian ] as damping scale we adopt the proposal of ref .",
    "@xcite , in which @xmath14 is function of @xmath1 and the spectral index @xmath0 : k_d=(2.9 10 ^ 4)^ ( ) ^ ( ) ^h^. [ kd_def ] the emt of pmf is a source term for the einstein - boltzmann system and , being these quadratic in the @xmath15 , the fourier transfoms of the emt components are convolutions @xcite : |_b(k)|^2&=&_d*p * p_b(p ) p_b(|*k*-*p*|)(1+^2 ) [ density ] +    & & [ ( 1+^2)(1-^2 ) + ( - ) ] [ vector ] +    & & ( 1 + 2 ^ 2+^2 ^ 2 ) , [ tensor ] where @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 denotes the volume with @xmath20 . + the analytical exact results for eqs . ( 4 - 6 ) are given for specific values of @xmath0 in our previous papers @xcite .",
    "however , the expressions for generic @xmath0 are rather complicated and can not be used in a numerical implementation .",
    "therefore we fitted the analytical results with easier expressions to be inserted as spectra for the pmf in modified version of ` camb ` @xcite and ` cosmomc ` @xcite . since the spectral shape varies with the spectral index we had to divide the spectra in different index ranges .",
    "the first natural split is between indices greater and smaller than @xmath21 : this division is very natural since is required by the change in the infrared behaviour between the two ranges . in order to achieve the best accuracy with the fits and considered the wide range of spectral indices that we wanted to explore we decided to do a further splitting in the @xmath22 range between positive and negative spectral indices .",
    "in the end we result into three different spectral fits for each emt component . in fig.[comparison_fit_scal ]",
    "we show respectively for scalar energy density , scalar lorentz force and vector anisotropic stress the results of our fits compared with the analytical results .",
    "we note how the fits are in excellent agreement with the analytical results and we refer the reader to appendix a for the details . in the next two subsections",
    "we address other two issues related to the theoretical characterization of a stochastic background of pmf , recently addressed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the first issue is represented by the cross correlation between lorentz force and magnetic energy density as pointed out in @xcite .",
    "in particular the analysis of the magnetized scalar mode involves three quantities : magnetic energy density , lorentz force and anisotropic stress .",
    "these quantities are not independent one from the other but are related throught the conservation equation for the pmf emt ( in the magnetic hydrodynamic limit ) : @xmath23 .",
    "we approximated the lorentz force and the magnetic energy density as anti - correlated @xcite , however , the lorentz force and the magnetic energy density correlation can be calculated , as for the their auto - correlations , as pointed out in ref .",
    "the cross - correlator between @xmath24 and @xmath25 is given by : _",
    "b(*k*)l_b(*k*)= d*p * p_b(p ) p_b(|*k*-*p*| ) + ( 1 - 1(^2+^2)+2 -^2 ) [ cross ] the above formula can be computed analitycally and in the appendix we show the analytical results both for @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the general behavior in the large scale limit of the spectrum ( for @xmath28 ) , the range relevant for cmb anisotropies , is : _",
    "b(k)l_b(k)&=&-|_b(k)|^2 for n_b-3/2 + _ b(k)l_b(k)&= & -c|_b(k)|^2 for n_b < -3/2where @xmath29 . in the appendix",
    "we show that the exact evaluation of the cross correlation has a small effect - in particular for strongly negative @xmath0 - with respect to our choice of considering the lorentz force and the energy density as fully anti - correlated .",
    "the second issue is related with the initial conditions for magnetized scalar perturbations . in our previous works",
    "@xcite we computed the intial conditions in the approximation of a universe dominated by radiation , following the results presented in ref .",
    "@xcite we investigated the importance of matter contributions to initial conditions .",
    "we computed the initial conditions with the inclusion of matter corrections and we give the details in appendix c. the results show that the introduction of matter corrections in the initial conditions have a negligible impact on the numerical computation of the magnetized scalar cmb anisotropies .",
    "we derived the constraints on pmf with current cmb anisotropy data performing an analysis of the wmap 7 year @xcite , acbar  @xcite data in temperature and of the bicep @xcite and quad @xcite data in polarization . in order to decrease the correlations between different data sets which cover the same region of the sky , we proceed as in ref .",
    "we remove in the analysis the following cmb band powers : a ) all the quad tt band powers since they overlap with data from the ` cmb8 ' region of acbar , b ) the acbar band powers with @xmath30 and @xmath31 to avoid overlap with wmap ( which is cosmic variance limited up to @xmath32  @xcite ) and contamination from foreground residuals , respectively , c ) the quad te band powers which overlap with wmap ones , the quad ee band powers which overlap with bicep , d ) the bicep tt , te band powers ( i.e. , we use just ee and bb information from bicep )",

    "the comparison shows that neither the means nor the bounds of the cosmological parameters of the @xmath6cdm model with reionization are basically affected by the presence of pmf : this means that @xmath1 and @xmath0 are not degenerate with the other six parameter of the concordance cosmological model .    in figs .",

    "[ data_tri ] we compare the results obtained including or excluding the scalar contribution .",
    "we note how , as expected from previous results on cmb anisotropies @xcite , the scalar contribution has a very little impact on the constraints on the amplitude @xmath1 and spectral index @xmath0 .",
    "this is due to the different shape of the cmb temperature spectra induced by the scalar and vector contribution of a stochastic background of pmf : compared to the cmb anisotropies sourced by the adiabatic mode , the pmf scalar mode is the dominant contribution on large scales , whereas the vector is the important one at high multipoles .",
    "since the pmf contribution does not suffer of the silk damping , only the vector contribution has the main chance to affect the cmb temperature sourced by the standard adiabatic mode .",
    "a stochastic background of pmf has also an impact on the matter power spectrum as shown in @xcite . in order to investigate if the addition of matter power power spectrum data could improve the constraints on the pmf , we perfomed a mcmc analysis adding the large scale structure ( lss ) data of sdss lrg dr4 @xcite to the cmb anisotropy data used before .",
    "we used the dr4 release because the dr7 requires the use of non - linear tools to compute the matter power spectrum which are unavailable for @xmath6cdm plus pmf .",
    "we have verified that the addition of the sdss data does not introduce any significant improvement on the constraints on pmf amplitude .",
    "the reason for the lack of improvement is that the matter power spectrum data reach scales of the order of @xmath59 where only pmf with positive spectral index have an impact , but pmf with blue spectral indices are already strongly constrained with cmb anisotropy data , therefore the results do not show any significant improvement .",
    "this result of a negligible impact of sdss dr4 data with respect to current cmb data is in agreement with @xcite .",
    "+ let us compare our constraints with other investigations . after our manuscript appeared on the archive , shaw and lewis obtained similar cmb constraints - of the order of @xmath60 ng at @xmath4 confidence level - with similar data sets in ref .",
    "@xcite . in @xcite",
    "stronger constraints of the order of @xmath61 ng at @xmath58 confidence level were reported .",
    "the reason for slightly different result might be either in the different datasets or in the different methodology used . concerning the use of matter power spectrum , the present manuscript and ref .",
    "@xcite agree that lss data add very little to cmb current constraints , when only linear scales are correctly included : we obtain analogous results either with sdss dr4 @xcite or 2df @xcite , without changing the cmb constraints in table i. another difference might be in the use of cbi data @xcite in @xcite , whose foreground contamination at high @xmath62 has been stressed in ref .",
    "@xcite : we believe that the difference might be due to either methodology and/or to the different use of cmb data .",
    "let us end this section by commenting on the constraints on the magnetic spectral index we derive , i.e. @xmath63 at @xmath58 confidence level .",
    "this would imply that positive values for @xmath0 are disfavoured and so would be causal mechanism which would have produced such pmf @xcite .",
    "certainly there is a trend in @xmath64 which allows for larger @xmath7 for negative values of @xmath0 : if we fix @xmath0 to the causal value of @xmath65 we obtain a much stronger constraint on the amplitude , i.e. @xmath66 ng @xmath58 confidence level . at the same time , we have verified that for undectatable values by cmb of @xmath5 - fixed to @xmath67 ng - no constraints are derived for @xmath0 , as expected .",

[ plancklog ] . since the log prior overweights the importance of small amplitudes for @xmath5 compared to the linear prior , the constraints obtained on @xmath5 by sampling logarithmically are tigher - @xmath51 ng at @xmath58 confidence level - , but depend strongly on the interval . as byproduct of the importance given to small amplitude for @xmath5 in sampling logarithmically",
