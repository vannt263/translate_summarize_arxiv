    "the lateral confinement of the electromagnetic field , several photonic modes couple to the exciton resulting in numerous exciton - polariton lower and upper branches .",
    "moreover the resulting polariton eigenstates show an energy splitting between polarizations that are mainly parallel and orthogonal to the wire long axis , as observed by various authors .",
    "this polarization - dependent splitting has proven to be a key - feature in different applications like optical parametric oscillation ( opo )  @xcite , or optical polariton interferometers  @xcite .",
    "it plays a role in the edge states of polariton honeycomb lattices  @xcite , which were recently proposed as @xmath5-topological polariton insulators  @xcite .",
    "the possibility to tune this energy splitting is of particular interest for the development of microcavity polaritonic devices .    while the polarization - dependent energy splitting is well - recognized and potentially useful , origins of this splitting and contributions of the different mechanisms identified by the various authors are still a subject of debate .",
    "three mechanisms have been reported influencing the polaritons energies : several authors have proposed that a polarization - dependent cavity energy is responsible for the polariton polarization - dependent energy splitting .",
    "the origin of this photonic splitting has been associated with an induced birefringence in the dbrs due to thermal strain  @xcite and with an anisotropic mode confinement  @xcite .",
    "a purely excitonic contribution has also been invoked  @xcite , its origins lying in the etched - induced strain release in the quantum well plane which leads to a reduction of the quantum well symmetry , and consequently lifts the degeneracy of the exciton manifold due to the exchange interaction . finally ,",
    "a polarization - dependent rabi energy has also been observed on 2d microcavities by applying a stress with a tip  @xcite .",
    "the origins of this effect lies in the induced mixing of the heavy - hole exciton with the light - hole exciton , resulting in an anisotropic oscillator strength of the excitonic transition .        in this work ,",

    "moreover , experiments reveal a change in the polarization splitting sign depending on the cavity - exciton detuning @xmath6 .",
    "these two observations - large magnitude and change of sign - suggest that the polarization splitting can not be explained by a single contribution , either of photonic origin ( @xmath0 ) , of excitonic origin ( @xmath1 ) , or of the light - matter coupling ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "our results show that all three splittings ( photonic @xmath0 , excitonic @xmath1 , light - matter coupling @xmath2 ) contribute to the polarization splitting to a varying degree depending on the cavity - exciton detuning @xmath6 .",
    "each contribution is carefully extracted from experimental data .    beyond the relative importance of the different contributions for the fundamental polaritonic mode , these experiments point out their common origin through etched - induced strain relative to the microwire structure in zinc - blende crystal .",

    "possible ways to engineer the microwires are proposed .",
    "the sample used in this study is a microcavity formed by two @xmath7 algaas dbrs .",
    "the dbrs consist in 26 ( 30 ) periodic alternance of @xmath8 and @xmath9 layers for the top ( bottom ) mirror .",
    "three groups of four -thick gaas quantum wells are embedded in the cavity and in the dbrs at the antinodes of the electric field to maximize the light - matter coupling . during the mbe growth ,",
    "the rotation of the wafer is interrupted to introduce a wedge on the cavity thickness . as a consequence , it is possible to tune the cavity modes energies with respect to the excitonic mode energy by simply shifting the excitation spot onto the sample .",
    "the wedge also affects the quantum well thickness , however , for a -thick gaas quantum well , the dominant contribution to this energy variation is the exciton confinement energy of about @xmath10 , the exciton binding energy being only a few mev .",
    "the confinement energy scales as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the quantum well thickness and the cavity mode energy @xmath13 varies as @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the cavity effective thickness . assuming a similar relative increase in the quantum well thickness and cavity effective length due to the wedge",
    ", we deduce that the exciton energy variation scales as @xmath16 where @xmath17 .",
    "this variation is thus only of the order of 13% of the cavity energy variation and can be safely neglected .",

    "i.e. _ , down to the gaas substrate . the wires long axis is orthogonal to the direction of the wedge so that the cavity - exciton detuning is the same all along the wire .",

    "this simple optical setup allows to observe the polariton dispersion curves .",
    "the linear polarization mainly parallel or orthogonal to the wire is selected with a half - wave plate and an analyzer .",
    "note that during the experiment , the polarization in the detection path changes slightly with the detuning as the polarizer is not kept fixed but set to observe polaritonic branches in the polarization eigenmodes .",
    "figure  [ fig : splitting-1 ] shows typical dispersion curves of the lower polariton branches .",
    "an energy splitting between polarizations mainly orthogonal and parallel to the wire long axis is visible .",
    "the polariton energies at @xmath19 are accurately obtained by fitting the corresponding polariton branches data with a model dispersion curve in order to take advantage of the redundancy of spectral information .",
    "the model used for the dispersion curve is a free fourth order polynomial which is sufficiently flexible to allow for resilience on the optical aberrations and possible misalignement ( see appendix  e for details ) .",

    "the experimental results are plotted as a function of @xmath21 the cavity - exciton detuning .",
    "this reference quantity is independent on the wires width and therefore can be used to compare different data sets .",
    "since the regularly spaced microwires are etched out of a 2d microcavity possessing a linear cavity energy dependency on the position due to the wedge introduced during the growth step , the cavity - exciton detuning is therefore a linear function of the position on the sample .",
    "this linear relationship is confirmed by the linear asymptotic behaviour of the lowest polariton branch on fig .",
    "[ fig : anticrossing]-a .",
    "let us now present the influence of the various degrees of freedom experimentally accessible on the polarization splitting .    , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are respectively , and .[fig : splitting-1],width=325 ]      stress applied to the sample can induce a birefringent behavior of the microcavity and possibly explain the appearance of the polarization splitting of polariton branches .",
    "@xcite besides , the finite wire width can be responsible for 1d excitonic / photonic confinement or strain release in the microwire .",

    "this distant sticking ( comparable to the size of the sample ) guarantees that the thermally induced stress is reduced .",

    "figure  [ fig : stick-1 ] shows also the polarization splitting as a function of detuning for various wire widths ( 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 and ) .",

    "let us now comment on the evolution of the observed polarization splitting with the detuning . at large negative detuning , the polariton state is mainly photonic and the negative observed splitting is a signature of the presence of a photonic contribution @xmath0 . at null detuning",

    "[ fig : stick-1 ] : when the temperature increases , the gaas bandgap is reduced and leads to a decrease in the exciton energy . if the cavity is negatively detuned from the exciton energy at low temperature , at high temperature the detuning gets closer to zero , in accordance with the observations of fig .",
    "[ fig : stick-1 ] . besides",
    ", the different polaritonic modes @xmath28 correspond to the polaritons obtained from different photonic modes .",
    "consequently , at negative detuning , an increase of @xmath28 is equivalent to an increase of the cavity energy and thus to a reduction of the cavity - exciton detuning .",
    "taking into account the bandgap decrease with temperature , the values of the @xmath24 splitting with temperature is compatible with the ones of fig .",
    "[ fig : stick-1 ] .",
