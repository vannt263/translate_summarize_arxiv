    "in the recent years much work has been devoted to the study of the properties of the chern - simons ( cs ) field @xcite .",
    "this was motivated not only by its potential applications to condensed matter physics but also because these studies have unveiled some new and interesting aspects of the dynamics of relativistic quantum physics . in particular , it has been noticed that in some circumstances the cs field plays a stabilizing role providing theories with improved ultraviolet behavior @xcite . however , most of these investigations have been restricted to the cases of spinless and spin 1/2 particles . the reasons behind this fact are the notorious difficulties found in the conventional treatment for higher spin fields in four dimensions .",
    "the troublesome aspects include noncausal propagation and lack of renormalizability .",
    "it is certainly worthwhile to study the interaction of a cs and spin one matter fields so that the origin of the difficulties could be better understood and perhaps new and safer routes could be found . with this in mind",
    ", we would like to present here the results of some investigations concerning the dynamics of spin one fields interacting through a cs term .    as a first observation",
    ", we note that a free , spin one particle of mass @xmath0 can be described alternatively by the proca lagrangian ,    @xmath1    where @xmath2 , or by the maxwell - chern - simons ( mcs ) lagrangian ,    @xmath3.\\ ] ]    whereas the first formulation encompasses both modes of spin @xmath4 , the latter , eq . (",
    "[ 2 ] ) , represents only a single mode of spin @xmath5 .",
    "the two formulations are not entirely inequivalent , however .",
    "the model ( [ 2 ] ) is equivalent to the self - dual model , @xcite , and this last model is like a square root of the proca s , @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , such equivalence does not in general persists whenever the models are coupled to other dynamical fields @xcite . in this investigation we will study the two body scattering amplitude for the cases of minimal coupling of ( [ 1 ] ) to a cs field and when in ( [ 1 ] ) the proca mass @xmath6 is replaced by a complex cs term .",
    "we will also consider the case of minimal coupling of ( [ 2 ] ) to a cs field .",
    "analogously to the scattering of lower spin particles we will expect to find similarities with the aharonov - bohm ( ab ) scattering@xcite .",
    "we may recall that for spinless particles the born approximation found in the perturbative method only agrees with the expansion of the exact result if a contact interaction , simulated in the field theory approach by a quartic @xmath7 interaction , is included from the beginning@xcite .",
    "it is also known that in the spin @xmath8 case no new interaction is needed , the role of the quartic interaction being played by the magnetic pauli term @xcite .",
    "we will pursue the investigation of the spin effects on the perturbative ab scattering by considering spin one particles .",
    "previous work in this direction started either with a complex proca field minimally coupled to the electromagnetic field @xcite or with a linearized yang mills equation@xcite . in both approaches",
    "the ab scattering was discussed from a first quantized viewpoint .",
    "here we consider the problem from the perspective of the theory of quantum fields , i. e. , as the low energy limit of a fully quantized relativistic theory of spin one particles interacting through a cs field .",
    "one advantage of such procedure is that it incorporates some purely quantum field effects , as vacuum polarization and anomalous magnetic momentum .    for the proca model",
    "minimally coupled to a cs field we will discuss the one loop renormalization program and calculate the anomalous magnetic moment of the matter field .",
    "as we will show , thanks to the ward identities satisfied by the basic interaction vertices , up to one loop the model is renormalizable , in spite of the bad behavior of the propagator of the matter field .",
    "the mcs model , on the other hand , turns out to be power counting renormalizable to all orders of perturbation .",
    "our work is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we present the polarization vectors and feynman rules for the models mentioned above .",
    "there , we also study the born approximation for the two body scattering amplitudes . in section iii",
    "we discuss in detail the one loop renormalization parts for the proca model and also determine the anomalous magnetic moment . a discussion of our results is presented in section iv .",
    "the paper contains also an appendix with details of the calculations .",
    "as a preliminary step toward our study of the ab scattering of two spin one particles , let us examine some of the kinematic aspects of the asymptotic theories .",

    "a convenient choice is    @xmath13    the creation operators @xmath14 and @xmath15 allow us to construct the fock space of the asymptotic states . in this space",
    ", we found that the spin part of the angular momentum operator    @xmath16    where @xmath17 , is given by    @xmath18.\\label{5a}\\ ] ]    in the particle s rest frame we can see that    @xmath19    are eigenstates of ( [ 5a ] ) .",

    "@xmath24 , leads us to the lagrangian    @xmath25    where @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",

    ", we get , in leading order ,    @xmath58 \\ ; , \\ ] ]    where @xmath59 is the scattering angle and @xmath60 is the total spin of the incoming particles .",

    "( [ 12 ] ) is a pauli interaction between each vector particle and the magnetic field produced by the other . in the anti - parallel case",
    "these effects cancel each other .",
    "let us now consider a model in which the mass of the vector particles has a topological origin .",
    "in such situation , one should use the polarization vector given in eq .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) .",
    "one can then envisage two possibilities to introduce the coupling to the cs field . one could use ( [ 8 ] ) but with the proca mass replaced by a topological one , i.e. ,    @xmath61    or just consider the mcs field described by ( [ 2 ] ) minimally coupled to a cs field . had we employed a topological mass instead of the proca s , the feynman rules would be the same unless for the propagator for the matter field which would become    @xmath62\\ ; . \\label{13a}\\ ] ]    as this propagator has a better ultraviolet behavior than ( [ 8a ] ) , the corresponding theory will be in principle renormalizable .    using this propagator we found a scattering amplitude ,    @xmath63 \\ ; , \\ ] ]    which differs from ( [ 12 ] ) just by a phase factor . in the case of minimal coupling",
    "we get a result which contains an additional numerical factor , @xmath64 , in the front of ( [ 14 ] ) .",
    "the two possible couplings give different cross sections and , at the present , there is no way to select a preferred one . besides that",
    ", radiative correction should produce diverse cross sections even in the cases associated to ( [ 12 ] ) and ( [ 14 ] ) where the corresponding lagrangians differ only by the mass terms .",
    "this is apparent from an inspection of the asymptotic behavior of the matter field vector propagators . in the case of the lagrangian with a proca mass , the longitudinal term in the propagator spoils renormalizability .",
    "however , a more careful analysis , to be done in the next section , shows that the degree of superficial divergence is actually lowered . taking into consideration this fact",
    "we conclude that the effective degree of divergence for a generic one loop graph @xmath65 is    @xmath66    where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the number of external lines belonging to the cs and to the matter vector field . in spite of the improved behavior , as established by ( [ 15 ] ) , the model still suffers from renormalization problems due to the divergence of graphs with @xmath68 equal to four and six .",
    "if the corresponding counterterms are added to ( [ 8 ] ) then the relations ( [ 8d]-[8f ] ) will not be able to guarantee renormalizability even at one loop .",
    "actually , higher order loops will contain nonrenormalizable divergences .",
    "the model is renormalizable only up to one loop . of course these comments",
    "do not apply if the mass has a topological origin .",
    "as we will show now , the one loop contributions to the amplitudes for the theory defined by eq . ( [ 8 ] ) have an effective degree of divergence as given in ( [ 15 ] ) . by power",
    "counting , any one loop graph with @xmath69 and @xmath70 internal cs and matter field lines , and containing @xmath71 and @xmath72 trilinear and quadrilinear vertices has the degree of superficial divergence given by    @xmath73    where we used    @xmath74    formula ( [ 15 ] ) follows now from the following observations :    \\1 .",
    "( [ 8d ] ) and ( [ 8e ] ) imply that the sum of graphs with @xmath75 external cs lines will contain the @xmath76 power of the external momenta and therefore in such sum the degree of divergence is effectively reduced by @xmath75 .",
    "besides that , due to ( [ 8f ] ) the contraction of the longitudinal part of the matter field propagator with the vertex @xmath77 produces a result whose degree in the loop momentum is reduced by @xmath71 .    after establishing ( [ 15 ] )",
    "we shall now examine each case of divergence , i. e. with @xmath78 , as specified by ( [ 15 ] ) . notice that logarithmically divergent parts are odd in the integration variables and therefore vanish under symmetric integration .",
    "this implies that , up to one loop , the six point vertex function of the matter field and the four point function with external lines associated to two cs field and two matter fields do not generate counterterms .",
    "however the radiative corrections to the two and to the four point vertex function of the matter field , the vacuum polarization and the trilinear vertex all have @xmath79 .",
    "we shall examine separately each one of them .",
    "we will employ dimensional regularization which , for the cases under consideration , already acts as a renormalization .",
    "let us begin by the self - energy contributions which in one loop correspond to the graphs shown in fig .",
    "symmetric integration show immediately that the contributions of the graphs 2(b ) and 2(c ) vanish .",
    "the amplitude associated to 2(a ) is ( details of this calculation are presented in the appendix )    @xmath80    although the degree of divergence indicates a quartic divergence , because of eq .",
    "( [ 8f ] ) , the above expression diverges only quadratically .",
    "we obtain @xmath81 where ( from now on we assume @xmath0 to be positive ) @xmath82 .",
    "\\label{18}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    although finite the above expression does not vanish at @xmath83 . to secure that the physical mass is @xmath0 one still have to proceed a finite renormalization .",

    "let us now focus our attention on the vacuum polarization contributions to the cs field two point function .",
    "the associated graphs have been drawn in fig .",
    "we have @xmath89 with @xmath90    after some calculations whose details are relegated to the appendix , we get    @xmath91    which is transversal as required by current conservation . in the last expression ,    @xmath92 \\ ; , \\label{26}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with    @xmath93    for low momentum @xmath94 approaches the expression ,    @xmath95    implying that the effective low momentum lagrangian contains a maxwell term , analogously to what happens in the spin 1/2 case .",
    "the lowest order contributions to the trilinear vertex come from the first three graphs shown in fig .",

    "usually this done by coupling the matter field to an external electromagnetic field . besides that , to disentangle the various contributions , here it is also convenient to do the calculations in a particular frame where @xmath103 , the breit frame .",
    "it is then found that the magnetic moment is given by @xcite    @xmath104    where    @xmath105    and the limit prescription singles out the term proportional to @xmath106 . in the tree approximation",
    "we get    @xmath107    where @xmath108 is the spin .",
    "the above result means that the gyromagnetic factor is @xmath109 .",
    "the gyromagnetic factor may be changed ( sometimes @xmath110 is desirable @xcite ) if the magnetic term @xcite    @xmath111    is added to ( [ 8 ] ) . in such case , it is easy to check that the magnetic moment for a spin one particle becomes @xmath112",
    ". nevertheless , as the new vertex ( [ 39 ] ) does not obey eq .",
    "( [ 8f ] ) the ultraviolet behavior of the green functions is definitely wrecked .",
    "thus , if one insists in having @xmath110 another approach becomes mandatory .",
    "for this reason we shall not anymore consider the possibility of adding ( [ 39 ] ) .",
    "after these remarks let us proceed toward the computation of the anomalous magnetic moment . from the expressions for the three graphs given above we have    @xmath113    we still have to add the contributions of the graphs 4(d ) and 4(e ) which corresponds to the analytic expressions    @xmath114 \\label{40}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and @xmath115 , \\label{41}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    however , for small momenta and in the breit frame , @xmath116\\label{42 } \\\\ \\gamma_e^{i\\alpha\\beta } ( \\vec p,-{\\vec p})&= & \\frac{-e^3 m}{8 \\pi\\theta } \\left[\\frac{1}{m^2 } p^\\alpha\\varepsilon^{\\beta i \\rho } p_\\rho+ \\frac{1}{m^2 } g^{i\\alpha}\\varepsilon^{\\beta\\sigma\\rho}p_\\sigma p^\\prime_\\rho \\right ] \\label{43},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    so that , saturating with external polarizations , we get    @xmath117 \\varepsilon_\\alpha(\\vec{p},s ) = -\\frac{2 e^3}{8\\pi   \\theta } \\epsilon^{ij}q_j \\label{44}.\\ ] ]    the sum of eqs ( [ 39a ] ) and ( [ 44 ] ) gives    @xmath118    thus , up to one loop , the magnetic moment for vector particles of spin @xmath4 is    @xmath119\\ ; . \\label{46}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it should be noticed that the graphs with self energy corrections contribute significantly to the final result .",
    "this is similar to what happens for the case of spin 1/2 particles in the coulomb gauge and results from the fact that in both cases the interaction with the cs field modifies the free propagators in an essential way . in our case ,",
    "as can be seen from ( [ 17 ] ) a cs term is produced .",
    "it is also worthwhile to remark that , as in the spin 1/2 case , the anomalous magnetic moment has the same sign for both spin up and spin down situations @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the radiative corrections to the propagators and vertices done in the previous section allow us to incorporate vacuum polarization and anomalous magnetic moment effects in the two body scattering amplitudes computed earlier .",
    "in fact , in the low energy regime we get            for the contributions from the vertex corrections indicated in fig .",
    "the result for fig .",
    "5b is obtained from the above expressions by exchanging @xmath43 and @xmath44 . for the vacuum polarization diagram , fig .",
    "5c , we found the result      the next diagram , fig .",
    "5d , does not contribute at leading order of @xmath57 . to complete the one loop calculation",
    "it is still necessary to compute the contributions of the triangle ( fig . 5e and 5f ) and box ( fig .",
    "5 g and 5h ) diagrams .",
    "these graphs present a logarithmic ultraviolet divergence ( by lorentz covariance the would be linear divergence does not appear ) . besides that they are so much intricate that even using dimensional regularization and employing an algebraic computer program the integrals did not turned out to be feasible .    to summarize , in this work we have studied some properties of spin one particles interacting through a cs field . as argued in the introduction ,",
    "this is a complex system but we found some simplifications which allowed us to study its behavior up to the one loop level .",
    "we have indicated other possible scheme as the use of the complex mcs model minimally coupled to a cs term .",
    "although this model is power counting renormalizable , the algebraic structure is very much cumbersome that no practical results are possible even at the one loop level .",
    "in such situation the scheme adopted by us seems to be the most useful although not being easily generalizable to higher orders .",

    "<S> we study spin one particles interacting through a chern - simons field . in the born approximation </S>",
    "<S> , we calculate the two body scattering amplitude considering three possible ways to introduce the interaction : ( a ) a proca like model minimally coupled to a chern - simons field , ( b ) the model obtained from ( a ) by replacing the proca s mass by a chern - simons term and ( c ) a complex maxwell - chern - simons model minimally coupled to a chern - simons field . in the low energy regime the results show similarities with the aharonov - bohm scattering for spin 1/2 particles . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the one loop renormalization program for the proca s model . in spite of the bad ultraviolet behavior of the matter field propagator , </S>",
    "<S> we show that , up to one loop the model is power counting renormalizable thanks to the ward identities satisfied by the interaction vertices . </S>"
