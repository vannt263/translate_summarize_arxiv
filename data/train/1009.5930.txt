    "the study of the dynamics of high frequency waves , see e.g. @xcite , has been motivated by the so - called quasilinear phenomenon in optical communication , where it was observed that spatially localized pulses evolve nearly linearly .",
    "the dynamics of high frequency waves can also be motivated by the well - posedness results in spaces of low regularity for dispersive pdes , see _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite .",
    "these papers indicated that a subtle high frequency averaging effect took place in the nonlinear dispersive dynamics making these results possible .",
    "more recently , in @xcite and @xcite , kdv was studied with regard to this averaging effect . in @xcite ,",
    "near - linear dynamics was established for high frequency initial data and in @xcite a new elegant proof of well - posedness in @xmath0 was found using explicitly high frequency averaging effects .",
    "the purpose of this article is twofold .",
    "first we establish near - linear dynamics in kdv under weaker and more natural assumptions than @xcite .",
    "the proof relies on the so - called differentiation by parts technique ( which is a variant of the normal form procedure ) from @xcite .",
    "secondly , we investigate how near - linear dynamics for kdv can be extended to the water waves problem .",
    "we use the standard derivation of kdv in the long wave , shallow water approximation to obtain physical parameters for which near - linear behavior might be observed .",
    "we should note that for kdv on the torus or a circle the linear solution is periodic in space and time and thus one does not have dispersive decay .",
    "it is also expected that the solutions of kdv on the torus will not be approximated by the linear evolution for infinite time .",
    "therefore the proof that the nonlinear evolution is almost linear ( in the sense of the subsequent theorem ) on a finite but large time scale in a way provides evidence that dispersion phenomena are not completely muted on the periodic setting .",
    "the seminal papers of bourgain , @xcite by establishing strichartz type estimates for periodic dispersive equations was probably the first step towards these new developments .",
    "[ theo : main ] consider the real valued zero mean solution of the kdv equation @xmath1 on @xmath2 with the initial data @xmath3 satisfying @xmath4 then , for each @xmath5 and small @xmath6 , we have @xmath7    note that the difference between the actual solution and the solution of the linear kdv is small in @xmath8 for @xmath9 up to @xmath10 .",
    "we note that near - linear dynamics for high frequency solutions is easier to establish on unbounded domains , as the solution disperses to infinity and weakly nonlinear theories apply . on bounded domains ( _ i.e.",
    "_ with periodic boundary conditions ) the solutions can not scatter to infinity . for the nls in the 2d torus , colliander _ et al .",
    "_ , @xcite , gave recently a nice proof .",
    "is an intermediate result between the iterated linear solutions and the situation at infinity .",
    "the nonlinearity averages out since dispersion will cause high harmonics to oscillate rapidly . throughout this paper",
    "we assume that we have global well - posed solutions which have additional regularity properties .",
    "the interested reader should see @xcite for the details .",
    "in addition , smooth solutions of kdv satisfy momentum conservation : + @xmath11 + because of the momentum conservation law we can modify the equation adding a harmless term and thus only consider mean zero solution .",
    "this will imply the the fourier series representation for the solution will have nonzero fourier modes , an assumption that we consistently make in our paper .",
    "in particular notice that all the norms are restricted to this subclass of smooth solutions .",
    "in addition we use the conservation of energy , + @xmath12 + the kdv equation is locally well - posed ( lwp ) in @xmath13 , @xcite . due to energy conservation kdv",
    "is globally well - posed and @xmath14 ) .",
    "kenig , ponce , vega , @xcite , improved bourgain s result and showed that the solution of the kdv is lwp in @xmath15 for any @xmath16 .",
    "later , colliander , keel , staffilani , takaoka , tao , @xcite , showed that the kdv is globally well - posed in @xmath15 for any @xmath17 thus adding a lwp result for the endpoint @xmath18 .",
    "recently t. kappeler and p. topalov , @xcite extended the latter result and prove that the kdv is globally well - posed in @xmath15 for any @xmath19 .",
    "0.2 in the main idea of our proof runs as follows .",
    "first write kdv @xmath1 on the fourier side , + @xmath20 + then , using the identity + @xmath21 + and the transformation + @xmath22 + the equation can be written in the form + @xmath23 + the substitution + @xmath24 + eliminates the linear term @xmath25 which has the highest growth at infinity and introduces oscillating exponentials into the nonlinear term .",
    "we have to show that @xmath26 stays almost constant for large times under our high frequency assumption .",
    "we can not neglect the averaging effects of the exponent . without the exponential factor the above system corresponds to burger s equation which exhibits strongly nonlinear dynamics .",
    "informally speaking , we mainly have three types of terms : +   + a ) low frequency harmonics , with @xmath27 small , give negligible contributions because of the high frequency assumption .",
    "+   + b ) intermediate terms are few in number as the diophantine equation @xmath28 has few solutions .",
    "+   + c ) high frequency harmonics , with @xmath27 large , are well - averaged by the exponent .",
    "+   + we already mentioned that the method we use was inspired by @xcite .",
    "originally it was developed by babin , mahalov and nicolaenko , @xcite , in studying the global regularity of solutions of 3d problems in hydrodynamics ( navier - stokes or boussinesq system ) . in their framework",
    "the presence of high - frequency waves lead to destructive interference and weakened the nonlinearity through time averaging allowing one to prove global regularity . for the kdv",
    "the high fourier modes of the linear term generates high - frequency oscillations which make the nonlinearity milder .",
    "there is an analogous phenomenon with the propagation of regularity to the burger s equation with fast rotation + @xmath29 + using duhamel s formula the solution can be written as + @xmath30 + for large @xmath31 the nonlinearity weakens and the life - span of the solution is prolonged .",
    "so large oscillations is what separates the bad behavior of the classical burger s equation and the good behavior of the burger s equation with fast rotation .",
    "the same method has recently been applied by kwon and oh , @xcite , to prove unconditional well - posedness for the modified kdv .",
    "the method of differentiation by parts helps to establish a priori estimates only in the @xmath32 norms for any @xmath33 .",
    "this is the heart of the matter in proving unconditional uniqueness , that is uniqueness of solutions to the modified kdv equation in the space @xmath32 alone .",
    "0.2 in the second motivation for our work comes from the various connections of the high frequency averaging process that we describe with certain aspects of the water wave theory .",
    "the dynamics of surface water waves has been an important object of study in science for over a century .",
    "soliton solutions and integrability in p.d.e.s are two examples of remarkable discoveries that were made by investigating water wave dynamics in shallow waters . in more recent times , the so - called rogue waves have been under an intense investigation , see for example @xcite and the references therein .",
    "these unusually large waves have been observed in various parts of the ocean in both deep , see _",
    "@xcite , and shallow water , see _ e.g. _ @xcite , motivating scientists to suggest various mechanisms for rogue wave formation .",
    "in the case of shallow water , one normally does not work with the full water wave equation but uses approximate models to study the evolution , in particular the formation of rogue waves .",
    "these models are nonlinear dispersive equations such as kdv , boussinesq approximations , _",
    "etc_. in particular , kdv describes unidirectional small amplitude long waves on fluid surface .",
    "@xcite for applications of kdv to rouge waves in shallow water .",
    "since rouge waves correspond to concentration of energy on small domains , one might argue that higher frequencies play important role in rouge waves formation .    here",
    "we provide some evidence , based on asymptotic expansions and numerical simulations that for sufficiently high frequency initial data , one - dimensional spatially periodic surface waves in shallow water exhibit near - linear behavior .",
    "thus , linear theories of rogue wave formations can be extended to nonlinear high frequency regime .    clearly , one has to be careful when considering short wave solutions for the equations obtained in the long wave approximations such as kdv .",
    "however , we show that there is a set of parameters when our high frequency solutions correspond to a realistic physical scenario in shallow water waves , see .",
    "in this section we apply a variant of normal form reduction , called differentiation by parts @xcite , to bring the equation to a more convenient form in which low order resonant terms are separate from the other terms . using the fourier series representation @xmath34 with + @xmath35 + we express kdv as an infinite system of ordinary differential equations + @xmath20 + notice that since the solution is real valued we have that @xmath36 . changing the variable + @xmath22 + ( notice again that @xmath37 ) , and using the identity + @xmath21",
    "+ we obtain @xmath38 + since @xmath39 differentiation by parts and yields + @xmath40 + @xmath41 + note that since @xmath42 , in the sums above @xmath43 and @xmath44 are not zero .",
    "the last two terms are symmetric with respect to @xmath43 and @xmath44 and thus we can consider only one of them .",
    "using we have + @xmath45 + @xmath46}.\\ ] ] + we note that @xmath47 can not be zero since @xmath48 . using the identity + @xmath49 + and thus by renaming the variables @xmath50 , we have that + @xmath51 + all in all we have that + @xmath52 + where + @xmath53 + and + @xmath54 + now let s single out the terms ( resonant terms ) for which @xmath55 and write + @xmath56 + where the subscript @xmath57 and @xmath58 stands for the resonant and non - resonant terms respectively .",
    "thus + @xmath59 + and + @xmath60 + the set for which holds is the disjoint union of the following 3 sets + @xmath61 + @xmath62 + @xmath63 + thus + @xmath64 + note that the second and third terms in the sum above are identically zero due to the symmetry relation @xmath65 .",
    "thus + @xmath66 + we obtain + @xmath67 + since the exponent in the last term is not zero we can differentiate by parts one more time and obtain that + @xmath68 + @xmath69 + @xmath70 + where + @xmath71 + as before we express time derivatives using . the terms containing @xmath72 and @xmath73 produce the same expressions and a calculation reveals that + @xmath74 + @xmath75 + where + @xmath76 + from now on @xmath77 means that the sum is over all indices for which the denominator do not vanish.the term corresponding to @xmath78 is + @xmath79 + and the sum of the terms corresponding to @xmath72 and @xmath73 is + @xmath80 + the phase function @xmath81 will be irrelevant for our calculations since it is going to be estimated out by taking absolute values inside the sums .",
    "for completeness we note that it can be expressed as + @xmath82 + hence for @xmath83 we have : + @xmath84 + if we put everything together and combining the two @xmath85 terms in one we obtain + @xmath86 where + @xmath87 + @xmath88 + @xmath89 + where @xmath90 .",
