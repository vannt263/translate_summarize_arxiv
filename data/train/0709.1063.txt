    "two of the most important classes of infinite - dimensional lie groups are groups of smooth maps , such as the lie group @xmath9 of smooth maps of a compact smooth manifold @xmath1 with values in a lie group @xmath10 , and groups of diffeomorphisms , such as the group @xmath11 of diffeomorphisms of a compact smooth manifold @xmath1 .",
