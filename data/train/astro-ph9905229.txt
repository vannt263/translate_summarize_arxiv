    "most theoretical protostellar disk models have relied on the @xmath0parametrization of the anomalous turbulent viscosity proposed by shakura  & sunyaev ( 1973 ) . in this context , the kinematic turbulent viscosity @xmath1 is written @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the sound speed , @xmath4 is the disk scale height and @xmath0 is a dimensional parameter ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "so far , only mhd instabilities ( balbus & hawley 1991 ) have been shown to be able to produce and sustain turbulence in accretion disks . however , because they develop only in adequately ionized fluid , the parameter @xmath0 is probably not constant through protostellar disks , and it may even be that only parts of these disks can be described using this @xmath0 prescription ( balbus & hawley 1998 and this volume ) .",
    "however , for the purpose of considering planet formation , as we are interested in here , we will use such models .",

    "if the disk were in a steady state , @xmath11 would not vary with radius and would be the constant accretion rate through the disk .",
    "we note that @xmath11 is related to @xmath0 through @xmath1 , but it also depends on the distribution of mass in the disk . at a given radius @xmath12 and for given values of @xmath11 and @xmath0",
    ", we solve the differential equations describing the disk vertical structure ( equations of vertical hydrostatic equilibrium , energy conservation and radiative transport ) with appropriate boundary conditions to find the dependence of the temperature , pressure , mass density and radiative flux on the vertical coordinate . an important point to note",
    "is that as well as finding the disk structure , we also determine @xmath10 for a given @xmath11 , so that a relation between @xmath13 and @xmath10 is derived . in order to investigate the solutions of the diffusion equation which governs the disk evolution ( see below ) and for other purposes , we found it convenient to derive analytic piece  wise power law fits to this relation .",

    "steady states : _ in general , an accretion disk is not in a steady state but evolves diffusely according to the following equation ( see lynden  bell  & pringle 1974 , papaloizou  & lin 1995 and references therein ) :    @xmath14 \\label{aa4 } .\\ ] ]    from this we see that the characteristic diffusion timescale at radius @xmath12 is @xmath15 , where @xmath4 is the disk semithickness . for disks with approximately constant aspect ratio @xmath16",
    "as applies to the models considered here , @xmath17 scales as the local orbital period .",
    "one thus expects that the inner regions relax relatively quickly to a quasi  steady state which adjusts its accretion rate according to the more slowly evolving outer parts ( see lynden  bell  & pringle 1974 and lin  & papaloizou 1985 ) . for estimated sizes of protostellar disks of about 50  au ( beckwith  & sargent 1996 )",
    ", the evolutionary timescale associated with the outer parts is about 30 times longer than that associated with the inner parts with @xmath18  au , which we consider here in the context of planetary formation .",
    "thus these inner regions are expected to be in a quasi  steady state through most of the disk lifetime . + _ steady state models : _ in the models we present here , we assume that the disk is immersed in a medium with background temperature @xmath19  k. in figures  [ fig1]a  b we plot @xmath20 ( where @xmath4 is defined as the vertical height at approximately unit optical depth above which the atmosphere is isothermal ) and @xmath10 versus @xmath12 for @xmath11 between @xmath21 and @xmath22  m@xmath7  yr@xmath23 ( assuming this quantity is the same at all radii , i.e. the disk is in a steady state ) and for illustrative purposes we have adopted @xmath24 . in figures  [ fig2]a ",
    "b we plot the midplane temperature @xmath25 versus @xmath12 and @xmath25 versus the midplane pressure @xmath26 for the same parameters .",

    "reprocessing of the stellar radiation by the disk has not been included .",
    "figure  [ fig1]a indicates that the outer parts of the disk beyond some critical radius ( @xmath27 to a few au , depending on @xmath0 and @xmath11 ) are shielded from the radiation of the central star by the inner parts ( the very outer parts may not be shielded but since they are optically thin they do not absorb the stellar radiation anyway ) . since reprocessing of the stellar radiation by the disk is not an important heating factor below these radii",
    ", this indicates that this process can be self - consistently ignored .",
    "however , it is possible that a multiplicity of solutions exists when reprocessing is taken into account ( chiang & goldreich 1997 ) , with it being important for cases in which the disk is flared , as may be the case with hh30 ( burrows et al .",
    "1996 ) , and unimportant when it is not , as may be the case with hk  tau ( stapelfeldt et al .",

    "reprocessing , when present , does not affect significantly the structure of the disk at @xmath285  au , where planets are supposed to form .",
    "below we shall consider the migration of protoplanetary cores from @xmath295  au , where they are supposed to form under conditions where ice exists , down to the disk inner radii .",
    "it is therefore of interest to estimate the mass of planetesimals @xmath30 contained inside the orbit of a core located at @xmath12 , since this can potentially be accreted by the core during its migration .",
    "we assume a gas to dust mass ratio of 100 and list the values of @xmath31 corresponding to @xmath24 and @xmath32 and @xmath33 and @xmath34  m@xmath7  yr@xmath23 ( characteristic of the early stages of disk evolution ) in table  [ tab1 ] .",

    "+ [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab2 ]      the previous section indicates that migration is relatively fast . in the context of the disk models presented above ,",
    "a core which builds up at a location between 1 and 5  au will migrate inwards once it reaches a mass of about 0.1  m@xmath36 on a timescale shorter than the time it takes to form a giant planet , according to current theories ( pollack et al .",
    "1994 ) . therefore , unless there is a mechanism to stop the migration of this core , it will never become a giant planet but will plunge onto the star .",
    "i migration could be avoided if the interaction could become nonlinear and a gap open up around the core .",
    "this would require small values of @xmath20 and @xmath0 ( see eq .",
    "[ [ crit1 ] ] and  [ [ crit2 ] ] ) and then type  ii migration would be very slow .",
    "if a gap opens up around a core before it has accreted a gaseous envelope , further accretion may take place ( e.g. , kley 1999 ; bryden et al .",
    "1999 ) so that it is conceivable it could become a giant planet .",
    "however , observations show that in some cases migration has to take place to push the protoplanet down to intermediate radii ( @xmath37  au ) , and has to stop there .",
    "if the viscosity were controlling the migration rate , unless there is a fortuitous disk dispersal , this would require @xmath0 to decrease as @xmath12 decreases , in contrast to what is proposed in current disk models ( see balbus & hawley in this volume ) . in the context of the disk models presented in ",
    "[ sec : disks ] , only a low surface mass density of gas would give long enough migration timescales to enable planet formation to take place before protoplanets with masses @xmath38 fall onto their parent star .",
    "in this context , ward ( 1997a ) has suggested that several small mass ( @xmath39  m@xmath36 ) cores could be built  up and maintained in isolation until the disk is partially depleted , at which point they would assemble into a larger core .",
    "however , it seems that such cores would interact with each other on a rather short timescale ( chambers , wetherill & boss 1996 ) .",
    "also , even if the core could assemble only in the late stages of the disk evolution , there may no longer be enough gas left in the disk at this point to form a giant planet , let alone a system of three giant planets , as observed around ups and ( butler et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "therefore either giant planet formation occurs faster than currently thought , on a timescale shorter than @xmath40 , or type ",
    "i migration can be halted somehow .",
    "we note that migration would cease if the disk were terminated by a magnetospheric cavity and the core were sufficiently far inside it ( lin et al .",
    "however , gas accretion is likely to be very much reduced in this case .",
    "the core migration should be halted before the disk is terminated for a giant planet to be formed .",
    "as noted above , ward ( 1986 , 1997b ) finds the direction of type ",
    "i migration could reverse from inwards to outwards if the disk midplane temperature decreased inwards fast enough .",
    "such a condition would not be expected in the disk models considered here . however ,",
    "if the inner disk is terminated through interaction with a stellar magnetic field , physical conditions may start to differ in the interaction zone where magnetic field lines penetrate the disk .",
    "additional energy and angular momentum transport mechanisms due to a wind for example may start to become important .",
    "as a result , an inward midplane temperature decrease might be produced .",
    "it may then be possible that migration could be halted such that the protoplanet retains contact with disk gas .",
    "in addition , work in progress ( the results of which will be published elsewhere ) shows that type ",
    "i migration is affected by the presence of a magnetic field in the disk .",
    "as described above , the torque exerted by the protoplanet on the disk depends mainly on the location of the radii where the perturbation is in resonance with the free oscillations of the disk . when a magnetic field is present",
    ", the perturbation can resonate not only with the epicyclic motions of the fluid but also with the alfven and magnetoacoustic waves which propagate through the fluid .",
    "therefore there are additional locations in the disk where a torque can be exerted .",
    "this additional contribution to the torque has to be considered .",
    "even if it were not important , the results derived by ward ( 1986 , 1997b ) and described above would be affected . whether the outer lindblad resonances are closer or not to the protoplanet than the inner lindblad resonances indeed depends on the gradient of the lorentz force in the vicinity of the protoplanet .    also",
    ", preliminary estimates of the effect of a finite eccentricity @xmath41 of the planet s orbit on type ",
    "i migration indicate that it may be reversed for reasonable disk models once @xmath42 .",
    "details will be published elsewhere .",
    "giant planets are believed to form out of protostellar disks by either gravitational instability ( kuiper 1951 ; cameron 1978 ; boss 1998 ) or by a process of growth through planetesimal accumulation followed by gas accretion ( safronov 1969 ; wetherill  & stewart 1989 ; perri  & cameron 1974 ; mizuno 1980 ; bodenheimer  & pollack 1986 ) .",
    "the first mechanism is expected to produce preferentially massive objects in the outer parts of the disk , if anything . here",
    "we study planetary formation within the context of the second mechanism , which is commonly accepted as the most likely process by which planets form in at least the inner ten astronomical units of protostellar disks .",
    "we note however that important issues related to this model still remain to be resolved ( see lissauer 1993 for a review ) .",
    "the build  up of the atmosphere of giant planets has first been considered in the context of the so  called core instability model by perri  & cameron ( 1974 ) and mizuno ( 1980 ; see also stevenson 1982 and wuchterl 1995 ) . in this model ,",
    "the solid core grows in mass along with the atmosphere in quasi ",
    "static and thermal equilibrium until the core reaches the so  called critical core mass @xmath43 above which no equilibrium solution can be found for the atmosphere .",
    "as long as the core mass @xmath44 is smaller than @xmath43 , the energy radiated from the envelope into the surrounding nebula is compensated for by the gravitational energy which the planetesimals entering the atmosphere release when they collide with the surface of the core . during this phase of the evolution ,",
    "both the core and the atmosphere grow in mass relatively slowly . by the time @xmath44",
    "reaches @xmath43 , the atmosphere has grown massive enough so that its energy losses can no longer be compensated for by the accretion of planetesimals alone . at that point , the envelope has to contract gravitationally to supply more energy .",
    "this is a runaway process , leading to the very rapid accretion of gas onto the protoplanet and to the formation of giant planets such as jupiter .",
    "further time ",
    "dependent numerical calculations of protoplanetary evolution by bodenheimer  & pollack ( 1986 ) support this model , although they show that the core mass beyond which runaway gas accretion occurs , which is referred to as the crossover mass ( because it is reached when the mass of the atmosphere is comparable to that of the core ) , is slightly larger than @xmath43 .",
    "the similarity between the critical and crossover masses is due to the fact that , although there is some liberation of gravitational energy as the atmosphere grows in mass together with the core , the effect is small as long as the atmospheric mass is small compared to that of the core .",
    "consequently , the hydrostatic and thermal equilibrium approximation for the atmosphere is a good one for core masses smaller than @xmath43 .",
    "therefore we use this approximation here and investigate how @xmath43 varies with location and physical conditions in the protoplanetary disk .      to calculate the structure of an atmosphere in hydrostatic and thermal equilibrium around a core of mass @xmath44 , we need to solve the equations of hydrostatic equilibrium , mass conservation and radiative transport ( mizuno 1980 ) . both radiative and convective transport",
    "are taken into account here , and it is assumed that the only energy source comes from the accretion of planetesimals onto the core .",
    "the atmosphere is confined between the radius of the core and that of the protoplanet s roche lobe .",
    "details of the calculations presented here are given in papaloizou & terquem ( 1999 ) , who used the equation of state given by chabrier et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and the same opacity law as in   [ sec : disks ] .    in figure  [ fig3 ] ,",
    "we plot curves of total protoplanet mass @xmath45 against @xmath44 at different radii in a disk with @xmath46 and @xmath47  m@xmath7  yr@xmath23 ( using the models described in   [ sec : disks ] ) . in each frame , the different curves correspond to planetesimal accretion rates @xmath48 in the range @xmath49@xmath22  m@xmath36  yr@xmath23 .",
    "the critical core mass @xmath43 , above which the equations have no solution , is attained at the point where the curves start to loop backwards . for masses below @xmath43 , there are ( at least ) two solutions , corresponding to a low  mass and a high  mass envelope , respectively . when the core first begins to gravitationally bind some gas ,",
    "the protoplanet is on the left on the lower branch of these curves .",
    "assuming @xmath48 to be constant , as the core and the atmosphere grow in mass , the protoplanet moves along the lower branch up to the right , until the core reaches @xmath43 .",
    "at that point the atmosphere begins to undergo very rapid contraction . since the atmosphere in complete equilibrium",
    "is supported by the energy released by the planetesimals accreted onto the protoplanet , @xmath43 decreases as @xmath48 is reduced .    for @xmath24 and @xmath50  m@xmath7  yr@xmath23 , @xmath43 at 5  au varies between 16.2 and 1  m@xmath36 as @xmath48 varies between the largest and smallest value .",
    "the former result is in good agreement with that of bodenheimer  & pollack ( 1986 ) .",
    "note that there is a tendency for @xmath43 to increase as @xmath12 decreases , the effect being most marked at small radii . at 0.05au ,",
    "@xmath43 varies from 42 to 9  m@xmath36 as @xmath48 varies between the largest and smallest value .",
    "similar calculations for different disk models ( see papaloizou & terquem 1999 ) indicate a relatively weak dependence of @xmath43 on disk conditions except when rather high midplane temperatures @xmath51  k are attained , as in the inner regions .",
    "these results are consistent with the fact that @xmath43 depends on the boundary conditions only when a significant part of the envelope is convective ( wuchterl 1993 ) , being larger for larger convective envelopes ( perri  & cameron 1974 ) .",
    "we note that it is unlikely there are planetesimals at radii @xmath52  au . therefore , although critical core masses for the same planetesimal accretion rates may be higher there , a lack of planetesimals may result in a fall in the core luminosity , making @xmath43 relatively small at these radii .      as noted in ",
    "[ sec : migration ] , cores of several earth masses form at about 5  au and migrate inwards to small radii before they can become a giant planet . in doing so , they continue to grow . to know whether they can reach the critical mass on their way , and thus begin to accrete significant amount of gas , we have to evaluate @xmath48 , i.e. the mass of planetesimals they accrete as they migrate in .",
    "papaloizou & terquem ( 1999 ) performed analytical estimates and numerical calculations to evaluate the fraction of planetesimals accreted by a core of mass @xmath5310  m@xmath36 migrating inward from @xmath29  au on a timescale @xmath54@xmath55  yr .",
    "they found that the migrating protoplanet accretes about 25% of the planetesimals inside its orbit , as if it were in a homogeneous medium without a gap forming in the planetesimal distribution .",
    "even more planetesimals are accreted when the migration is slower .",
    "given that the disk models typically contain at least about 8  m@xmath36 interior to 5  au ( see   [ sec : disks ] ) , this means that the accretion of planetesimals is high enough to maintain the core luminosity such that attainment of @xmath43 ( and therefore gas accretion ) does not occur as long as planetesimals are present , i.e. above @xmath560.1  au .",
    "runaway gas accretion onto a small core can then occur at these radii .",
    "however , if the core is too small , the gas accretion phase may be longer than the disk lifetime . even for core masses in the range",
    "1520  m@xmath36 , the build  up of a massive atmosphere may take a time @xmath57  yr ( bodenheimer et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the reason for this is that once the core starts to accrete a significant atmosphere , energy production occurs through its gravitational contraction .",
    "the luminosity produced then slows down the evolution .",
    "an estimate of the evolutionary ( kelvin  helmholtz ) timescale @xmath58 at this stage has been calculated by papaloizou & terquem ( 1999 ) .",
    "typically , they found @xmath59  yr for core masses in the range 1020  m@xmath36 for radii larger than 0.075  au .",
    "the core masses required to get such a characteristic timescale increase rapidly interior to 0.06  au .",
    "however , we note that they decrease as the mass transfer rate through the disk does .",
    "the fact that fairly large core masses are required to give evolutionary timescales comparable or less than the expected disk lifetime means that mergers of additional incoming cores may be required in order to produce a core of sufficient mass that real runaway gas accretion may begin .",
    "table  [ tab1 ] indicates that , in a disk with @xmath60 and @xmath61 or @xmath34  m@xmath7  yr@xmath23 , 40  m@xmath36 of planetesimals are contained within 1 or 5  au .",
    "therefore , the timescale for building  up a core with a mass between 20 and 40  m@xmath36 at small radii is typically the timescale it takes for planetesimals to migrate from 1 or 5  au down to these small radii . according to ward ( 1997b ; and see   [ sec : migration ] ) , the migration timescale of cores of @xmath62  m@xmath36 located at 1 or 5  au is at most @xmath63  yr in such a disk , and it decreases with increasing core mass . if the disk has @xmath24 , 40  m@xmath36 of planetesimals are contained within 5 or 11  au . in this case again , the migration timescale of cores of @xmath62  m@xmath36 at 5 or 11  au is about @xmath63  yr . therefore ,",
    "if planetesimals can be assembled into cores of at least a few tenths of an earth mass at these radii on a reasonably short timescale , a massive core could be obtained at small radii ( if at least three cores are present , they can not stay in isolation but interact with each other , as shown by chambers , wetherill & boss 1996 ) .",
    "a massive core can be built  up through the merger of additional incoming cores either after having stopped at small radii or on its way down to small radii ( where it would still be expected to be stopped ) .",
    "the former process resembles that discussed by ward ( 1997a ) .",
    "the latter scenario would occur if more massive cores , which migrate faster , overtake less massive cores on their way down . in any case , several cores would necessarily interact with each other at some point so that core isolation , which would increase planet formation very much if it occurred ( pollack et al . 1994 ) , would be avoided .",
    "supposing that a protoplanetary core massive enough can be built  up on its way down to small radii and that it continues to rapidly move inward until it gets interior to the disk inner boundary , it can only accrete the gas which is in its vicinity , i.e. typically the amount of gas contained within @xmath640.1  au .",
    "since the core is expected to reach these radii early in the life of the protoplanetary disk , there may still be an adequate amount of gas there ( see   [ sec : disks ] ) for it to build  up a large envelope and become a giant planet .",
    "however the conditions for that to happen are rather marginal .",
    "if the protoplanetary core is stopped at some small radius before the disk is terminated ( see   [ sec : migration ] ) , it might be able to retain contact with disk gas . in that case",
    "it might be able to accrete enough gas supplied from the outer disk by viscous evolution to build  up a massive atmosphere .",
    "the scenario discussed in this section might be able to produce short period planets in the early stages of the disk evolution .",
    "it would more likely result in a single planet at @xmath640.1  au on a timescale significantly shorter than for _ in situ _",
    "formation if the core were in isolation in this latter process .",
    "in this paper we have described briefly standard @xmath0disk models and presented some numerical calculations for @xmath24 and gas accretion rates through the disk varying from @xmath21 to @xmath22  m@xmath7  yr@xmath23 .",
    "then we have discussed planet migration and formation in the context of these models .",
    "we have reviewed the current theories of protoplanet migration , focusing on the gaseous disk  protoplanet tidal interaction . according to these theories ,",
    "protoplanets migrate from the location where they begin to form , which is supposed to be @xmath535  au , down to the disk inner parts , on a timescale significantly shorter than the disk lifetime or even the planetary formation timescale .",
    "clearly the theory has to be developed to explain how at least some of the planets halt their migration before they plunge onto their parent star .",
    "however , these results suggest that planets may not form _ in situ _ but more likely form at the same time as they migrate .    accordingly ,",
    "we have considered both the growth of the core and the built  up of the envelope of a giant planet in the course of its migration .",
    "our calculations indicate that accretion of planetesimals during the migration is likely to be high enough to maintain the core luminosity such that attainment of the critical core mass ( and therefore significant gas accretion ) does not occur as long as planetesimals are present , i.e. above @xmath640.1  au . although runaway gas accretion can then begin onto small mass cores at these small radii , the timescale for building  up a massive envelope becomes longer than the disk lifetime if the core is too small .",
    "however , cores massive enough can be built  up through mergers of additional incoming cores on a timescale shorter than for _ in situ _",
    "formation if the core were in isolation in this latter process .",
