    "the catalogue is available through the strasbourg astronomical data center ( cds ) ; it carries the number ii/228 .",
    "the denis instrument is mounted at the cassegrain focus of the 1m eso telescope ( la silla - chile ) .",
    "it contains three cameras : a tektronix ccd with @xmath35 pixels and two nicmos infrared detectors with @xmath36 pixels .",
    "the array of the camera has four quadrants to reduce the read - out time , and each quadrant , especially in the @xmath8 band , presents different image characteristics and must be treated separately .",
    "the pixel sizes are @xmath15 in @xmath8 and @xmath16 in @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "the total integration time is @xmath37 secs for each image .",
    "the sampling of the image is @xmath15 in all three wave bands .",
    "the @xmath9 and @xmath10 images are dithered to a @xmath15 pseudo  resolution , using a microscanning mirror .",
    "they consist of a set of @xmath37 frames each obtained in @xmath38 sec integration time , shifted by @xmath39 pixel in right ascension ( ra ) plus @xmath40 pixel in declination ( dec ) .",
    "the denis strategy is to divide the sky into three declination zones and scan each in strips of @xmath41 in dec and @xmath42 in ra .",
    "the overlap in ra between consecutive strips is @xmath43 .",
    "each strip consists of 180 images of @xmath44 with an overlap of @xmath43 between each image .",
    "the observation of a photometric standard star consists of @xmath45 sub - images shifted according to a circular pattern in order to have the star always at a different position on the chip .",
    "one @xmath8 standard is observed before the observation of a strip and one @xmath9 and @xmath10 standard afterwards . on average @xmath34 to @xmath45 strips per night are observed .",
    "data on the mcs were taken during observing seasons from august to march , the first centered on december 1995 , and the last one on december 1998 .",
    "the two clouds , lmc and smc , were covered by @xmath46 and @xmath47 strips , respectively .",
    "data reduction took place in two centers : the paris data analysis center ( pdac ) and the leiden data analysis center ( ldac ) .",
    "pdac pre  processed the raw data and ldac extracted and parametrized objects ranging from point sources to small extended sources .",
    "the reduction at ldac by the first author led to the detection of numerous technical problems ( astrometry for example ) , which had escaped the checks of the automatic pipeline .",
    "compared to the first relase of denis data ( epchtein et al .",
    "@xcite ) this catalogue differs in terms of flags , astrometric reference catalogue , association criteria and photometric calibration ( use of the overlapping region between adjacent strips ) .",
    "besides , our catalogue covers a portion of the sky not overlapping with the first denis data release . the source list ( table 7 ) and",
    "the photometric information ( table 8) are electronically available at cds via this catalogue . with further denis data releases data on a strip by strip basis , therefore not merged into a single catalogue without treating the overlapping regions in terms of photometry and astrometry ,",
    "will also be available .",
    "this means that all the strips covering the same region of the sky regardless of their quality will be available ; multiple entries for a single objects could then be retrieved .",
    "we show in section 3.2.3 the consistency of our calibration within each cloud .    the work of fouqu et al .",
    "@xcite focuses on the absolute photometric calibration of the denis data .",
    "this calibration , once completed after the termination of the survery , might induce a systematic shift on the photometry of the present catalogue .      at the pdac",
    "the images were corrected for sensitivity differences and atmospheric and instrumental effects .",
    "their optical quality was judged on the basis of the parameters that describe the point spread function ( see sect .",
    "@xmath48 ) .",
    "the received intensity from the target image also contains background contribution from the telescope and the atmospheric radiation . besides , the sensitivity varies across the array of the camera .",
    "the true signal ( @xmath49 ) for the pixel @xmath50 is obtained from : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the measured intensity after subtraction of dark currency , @xmath53 is the flat field after dark subtraction , @xmath54 is the background and @xmath55 is the bias level .",

    "the four @xmath8 quadrants are treated separately .",
    "this is also done for each of the @xmath37 sub - images in the @xmath9 and @xmath10 bands .    as a second step we select low ",
    "background images from the sunrise sequence ( @xmath60 in a normal strip ) with a low background value . to identify and avoid crowded fields and fields affected by saturated stars we combine measurements taken during different nights .",
    "we then determine the flat @xmath53 and the bias @xmath55 by minimizing the expression : @xmath61 ^ 2\\ , ,   \\label{flabia}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 is the number of selected images ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "in the third step , we applied the new values of the flat and the bias to the set of selected images to obtain a new estimate of the background value , more appropriate to the particular night .",
    "the quality of the determination of the parameters involved is improved by iteration of the above procedure .",
    "the bias so far determined is a mean value for the night .",
    "because it varies during the night , its value for a given strip is estimated to be : @xmath63}{n}\\ , , \\label{bias}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 is the total number of images per strip ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "after dark subtraction , the bias contains only the contribution of the instrumental and atmospheric emission which does not affect the @xmath8 band , but does affect strongly the @xmath10 band and a higher number of iterations is sometimes necessary .",
    "the large number of available flat / bias - images ( @xmath60 ) gives a quite high degree of statistical confidence to both determinations .",
    "this is not true in case of calibration sequences that involve only @xmath45 images . in this case",
    ", the bias determined for the strip nearest in time is applied .",
    "the pixel size of the @xmath9 and @xmath10 channels is @xmath16 and the sampling is @xmath15 in both directions .",
    "the real width of any point source is therefore potentially narrower than the pixel ( @xmath16 ) . in terms of",
    "signal processing the sources are not under - sampled , but the width of the filter is broader than the sampling . to estimate the width of the signal the convolution of the signal profile ( assumed to be elliptical ) and the pixel size has been taken into account .",
    "the method of least squares has been applied to the projection of sources onto ra , dec and diagonal axes ( borsenberger , @xcite ) . in the @xmath8 and the @xmath9 bands",
    "there are enough sources to build a model that describes the behaviour of the projected widths in each image . in the @xmath10 band",
    "several images were stacked together prior to the determination .",
    "we refer to http://www-denis.iap.fr/docs/tenerife.html for more details on the pdac data reduction .",
    "ldac extracts point sources from the images delivered by pdac . from these sources , it derives and then applies astrometric and photometric calibration to obtain a homogeneous point source catalogue .",
    "the astrometric reference catalogue is the usno ",
    "a2.0 ( monet @xcite ) that provides on average @xmath64 `` stars '' per denis image .",
    "the photometric denis standard stars belong to different photometric systems of which the major ones are : landolt ( @xcite ) , graham ( @xcite ) , stobie et al .",

    "an absolute calibration , together with a definition of denis photometric bands is given by fouqu et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the first ldac task is to reduce the information from each image into an object list .",
    "this is done using the sextractor program ( bertin and arnouts @xcite ) version @xmath65 .",
    "positions are determined through pairing information among frames , channels and with the reference catalogue .",
    "the astrometric solution makes use of the fact that each map has an area of overlap with neighboring maps , and that objects in the overlapping region have been observed many times .",
    "the projected position of the multiply observed sources , in terms of their pixel positions , contains information on the telescope pointing and the plate deformations .",
    "the plate deformation is derived through a triangulation technique , matching bright extracted objects with astrometric reference objects .",
    "the resulting global solution for each strip takes into account possible variations along the strip .",
    "the plate offsets are determined using all but the faintest extracted objects , matching among channels ( wave bands ) and in overlap .",
    "a least square fitting technique is then applied to the functional description of the detector deformation and its variation to obtain the full solution on the basis of the pairing information .",
    "thereafter , the celestial position , its error and the geometric parameters of each object are calculated .",
    "the standard position accuracy derived is rms @xmath66 arc sec with maximum excursions of @xmath67 arc sec .",
    "this error is in addition to the rms of @xmath68 arc sec of the astrometric reference catalogue .",
    "magnitudes are estimated within a circular aperture of @xmath69 in diameter after a de  blending process , that determines which pixels are within the aperture , and what fraction they contribute to each individual source ( bertin & arnouts , @xcite ) .",
    "this aperture collects @xmath70 of the light when considering a seeing of @xmath71 and the pixel size of @xmath16 for the infrared wave bands . for homogeneity",
    "we used the same aperture also for the @xmath8 band .",
    "the source magnitude ( @xmath72 ) corresponding to the wavelength @xmath73 is defined as : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the observed flux and @xmath76 defines the zero  point of the magnitude scale at the wavelength @xmath73 .",
    "the determination of the instrumental quantity @xmath76 to correct the stellar magnitude for atmospheric effects is done on a nightly basis .",
    "first , standard star measurements are matched with the information stored in the standard star catalogue .",
    "second the instrumental zero - point ( @xmath76 ) is derived for each of the eight measurements of the standard star assuming a fixed extinction coefficient , @xmath77 ( eq . [ m_0 ] ) .",
    "the adopted values of @xmath77 are @xmath78 for the @xmath8 band and @xmath79 for both the @xmath9 and @xmath10 bands .",
    "these values have been determined from the photometric measurements performed during calibration nights ( nights where only standard stars were observed ) .",
    "@xmath80 @xmath81 is the magnitude of the standard star from the standard star catalogue and @xmath75 is the flux as measured at a given air mass ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "standard stars were selected near the airmass limit of the strips and to be roughly of the same spectral type ; this simplifies the taylor expression used to describe the extinction law because colour terms ( guglielmo et al .",
    "@xcite ) and the non  linear terms are of minor importance ; in the infrared the dependence of the extinction on @xmath82 is almost linear for @xmath83 . in principle , both @xmath76 and @xmath84 can be determined simultaneously and the non  linear terms can be incorporated as well if a sufficient number of star measurements are available , but for a single night there are not enough , in fact the use of the approximated law ( eq . [ m_0 ] ) gives a systematic offset between the magnitude of the source in the overlap of two strips of comparable , but different , photometric conditions . after a considerable investigation it turned out that this offset could be greatly reduced if a fixed extinction coefficient is used .",
    "some differences are left when the observations have been performed in different photometric conditions or when too few standard star measurements were done .",
    "[ diff ] shows the computed differences between the magnitudes of the sources detected in the overlapping region of two strips observed under comparable photometric conditions ( ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) ) and of two strips observed with different photometric conditions ( ( d ) , ( e ) , ( f ) ) in the @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 bands , respectively .",
    "faint sources give rise to a larger dispersion .",
    "the systematic shift is clearly visible in fig .",

    "the final nightly value of @xmath76 , for each wave band , is calculated by averaging the single determinations for each standard star and among all the standard stars observed during that night , after removal of flagged ( sect .",
    "4 ) measurements ( this reduces on average the number of measurements per star from @xmath45 to @xmath34 ) .",
    "the flagged measurements have a non - zero value for at least one of the types of flag considered in the pipeline reduction .",
    "only standards fainter than @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 mag are used .",
    "the instrumental @xmath76 and its standard deviation are listed for each strip in the quality table ( table [ quatab ] ) .",
    "mean values ( @xmath85 ) are : @xmath86 ( @xmath8 ) , @xmath87 ( @xmath9 ) and @xmath88 ( @xmath10 ) .    using the overlapping regions of adjacent strips to correct for remaining differences we performed a general photometric calibration , separately for the lmc and for the smc .",
    "we calculated the magnitude difference of cross - identified sources between two adjacent strips of sources detected in three wave bands .",
    "the histogram of these differences in magnitude shows when a systematic shift is present between the two strips ( fig .",
    "[ diff ] ) . in only a few cases is the average magnitude affected by more than 0.1 mag . if necessary we applied a systematic shift ( table [ quatab ] ) .",
    "experience showed that if a strip is poorly calibrated the magnitude difference in the overlap with the previous strip has a sign opposite to the difference found in the overlap with the next strip .",
    "note that observing a strip in good photometric conditions but having too few standard star measurements to perform the calibration may induce alone this offset ; the equal number of detected objects as a function of magnitude per band in both strips indicates , as just mentioned , a minor difference in the photometric conditions under which each strip was observed , increasing the confidence we place in the correction procedure .",
    "only @xmath37 strips out of @xmath89 for lmc observations and @xmath30 strips out of @xmath90 for smc observations show this behaviour . the maximum observed shift amounts to 2.45 mag in the @xmath9 band .",
    "sources with corrected magnitude are easily recognized from their strip number associated to each detected band ( table [ soutab ] ) .",
    "table [ quatab ] reports the amount of the applied shift as a function of strip number . in some cases ,",
    "the difference shows a dependence on declination , but the effect on the averaged magnitude , in the area of the magellanic clouds , is not significant ( less than @xmath79 mag ) , and can be ignored .",
    "the internal statistical rms error is between @xmath66 and @xmath91 mag at the detection limit , faint sources have larger errors . for completeness",
    "we included in the catalogue sources detected above and below the reference saturation and detection limits , their photometric errors ( larger than @xmath91 mag ) show the confidence of the detection .",
    "the standard deviation on @xmath76 is in most of the strips below @xmath78 mag , but spreads from @xmath92 to @xmath93 mag .",
    "larger values are detected in the strips where a photometric shift was also applied , therefore the resulting accuracy is , for these few cases , not better than @xmath79 mag . in all other cases",
    "the resulting accuracy has an rms error better than @xmath78 mag .",
    "all extracted objects are matched on the basis of their geometrical information assuming an elliptical shape ( ra , dec , @xmath94 : semi  major axis , @xmath95 : semi  minor axis , @xmath96 : inclination angle ) within one wave band , among the three wave bands within a strip and among different strips .",
    "the geometrical parameters of each object are evaluated at the @xmath59 level of the row image ; @xmath94 and @xmath95 are the second order moments of the pixel distribution within the size of the photometric aperture .",
    "typical values are @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 for the @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 band , respectively , differences among the three wave bands mainly depend on the differences in sensitivity ; the second order moments characterize the psf .",
    "the effective area used during the association procedure is @xmath100 times ( tolerance ) the area defined by the @xmath94 and @xmath95 values of both object , when the association is performed within each band of a strip .",
    "sources previously de  blended are not associated . when the association is done among different bands the tolerance value increases to @xmath101 .",
    "we associate two objects when the center position of one of them is within the bounds of the ellipse of the other , even if the center of the second is outside the ellipse of the first one , and vice versa . for the coordinates",
    ", we always used a weighted average ( based on the signal to noise ratio and detection conditions as derived from the source extraction program and the astrometric calibration ) .",
    "for the magnitudes we decided not to average or to combine magnitudes from different epochs ( strips ) because of the possible variability of a large fraction of the detected objects .",
    "objects associated within the same strip are given with the average of the magnitudes .",
    "when the association involves overlapping strips we distinguish the following cases : ( 1 ) for objects detected in all three wave bands in both strips we choose the entry from the strip with the lowest value of @xmath102 , where n is the number of sources detected in the overlap ; ( 2 ) for objects detected in an unequal number of wave bands , we chose the entry from the strip with the highest number of detected wave bands ; ( 3 ) for objects detected in two different wave bands we choose the entry from the strip with the lowest @xmath102 , including the third magnitude from the other strip .",

    "@xmath103    during the source extraction process , ldac produces more flag information ( tables [ extflag ] and [ artifact ] ) .",
    "artifact flags are not present in the output parameter list because they have been used as a primary selection criteria to filter the catalogue ; most of the cosmic rays , glitches and optical ghosts will have been eliminated .",

    "most are bright and easily recognizable . during the pipeline reduction",
    "photometric fluxes are calculated in @xmath69 and in @xmath106 apertures .",
    "`` dusty  like objects '' give a negative flux in the larger aperture ( and its value is set to @xmath107 ) . in their proximity the flat value for the pixels is dominated by their continuous presence in all images along the strip , therefore we end up with an area with negative flux next to the dusty  like objects. this area is not always in the same position because of bending of the telescope during the observation of a strip . to eliminate these spurious detections we required that both aperture fluxes were positive .",
    "this selection also allowed the removal of glitches not previously flagged , sources too close to the image borders or too close to broad dead pixel regions and dummy sources with photometric errors greater than @xmath93 mag .",
    "an additional filtering criterion is based on the diagram of the isophotal area of one object at the @xmath108 level of the raw image ( isophotal area ",

    "finally we eliminated sources for which the object psf could not match the instrumental psf .",
    "this led to the loss of a few percent of @xmath10 detections ; this effect does not depend on the source brightness and arises as a consequence of image defects .",
