    "fractional vector calculus ( fvc ) is important in describing processes in fractal media , fractional electrodynamics and fractional hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "but an effective fvc is still lacking .",
    "there are many problems in defining an effective fvc .",
    "one is that fractional integral and fractional derivative are defined  half \" , that is to say , they are defined only on the right or the left side of an initial point . and",

    "we can not across this cutting point .",
    "so if we want to describe the behavior near the initial point , we need define both the right and the left functions . the situation will become even more complicated when we deal with high dimensions . in this letter",
    "we will define fvc in spherical coordinate framework . since in the spherical coordinate framework",
    "the radius is naturally bounded to the positive half , we need just one fractional derivative .    using this frame",

    "as has been aforementioned , fractional derivative is defined only on the right or the left half of the real line , which gives complications in defining an effective fvc with cartesian coordinates .",
