    "tw hya (= cd34 7151 , h = 7.6 mag ) is a star with a large h@xmath3 emission equivalent width , visual variability and location at 23@xmath4 galactic latitude , and it was thus labeled as `` peculiar '' by @xcite .",
    "@xcite identified it as a spectral type k7ve t tauri star far from any molecular cloud ( i.e. `` isolated '' ) .",
    "tw hya displays classical signs of being surrounded by an accretion disk , including variable h@xmath3 emission @xcite and excess flux over photospheric in the ultraviolet and near - infrared .",
    "in addition it has disk signatures in the form of far - infrared @xcite , submillimeter continuum @xcite and co line emission @xcite .",
    "all of these disk indicators are large for a star as old as tw hya , which has an age of @xmath28 myr determined from pre - main sequence evolutionary tracks @xcite .",
    "zuckerman et al . inferred a face - on viewing geometry for the disk based on the small co line widths they observed .",
    "recent imaging observations do indeed reveal a circular disk .",
    "scattered radiation from the disk has been imaged at visible and near - infrared wavelengths @xcite , and circumstellar dust emission has been imaged at a wavelength of 7 mm using the vla @xcite .",
    "the hipparcos mission measured the distance to tw hya as 56@xmath57 pc @xcite .",
    "an eponymous association of @xmath220 star systems has been identified from x - ray and proper motion surveys within 10@xmath4 and 10 pc of tw hya @xcite .",
    "the approximately coeval members of the tw hya association are amongst the products of recent star formation closest to the sun .",
    "however , only three other members have measurable far - infrared excesses from iras : hr 4796a , hd 98800 , and hen3 - 600 ( l@xmath6/l@xmath7=0.01 , 0.19 , and 0.21 , respectively ) .",
    "the optical depth around tw hya ( l@xmath6/l@xmath7=0.25 ) is the largest and corresponds to the reprocessing expected for a optically thick disk @xcite .",
    "the state of disks of intermediate age ( @xmath210@xmath8 yr ) has not been well studied .",
    "the structure of the youngest disks ( @xmath910@xmath10 yr ) , hundreds to thousands of au in radius around embedded protostars have been copiously studied with millimeter interferometry ( * ? ? ? * e.g. ) and visual and infrared imaging ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there are only a few examples of older late - type stars surrounded by disks which have been spatially resolved in the near - infrared , most of which are in binary systems ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. ) . at ages",
    "@xmath1110@xmath8 yr , most known disks orbit early type stars because only in these systems do the disks scatter enough photons to be detectable ( e.g. @xmath12 pic @xcite ) .",
    "tw hya , thanks to its proximity to the sun and its age , is thus an excellent laboratory for studying a disk of intermediate age around a low mass star .",
    "this age range is thought to be critical in the evolution of the planetesimals that form the cores of gas giant and terrestrial planets @xcite .",
    "tw hya was observed at two different wavelength bands with the near infrared camera and multi object spectrometer ( nicmos ) aboard the hubble space telescope .",
    "the star was placed in the coronagraphic hole in camera 2 ( @xmath20.076  pixel@xmath13 , @xmath219  square field of view ) .",
    "the observational strategy was the same for both  a total of 1216 s of integration taken in three non - destructive multiple - readout ( multiaccum ) sequences at each of two telescope orientations , rolled 7@xmath4 with respect to each other about the target axis . to minimize time - dependent point spread function ( psf ) variations ,",
    "the rolled image sets were obtained within @xmath240 minutes in a single target visibility period .",
    "the first observation was made with the f160w filter ( @xmath14=1.59 , fwhm=0.40 ) on 1998 august 16 and the second was made with the f110w filter ( @xmath14=1.10 , fwhm=0.59 ) on 1998",
    "november 25 .",
    "a summary of the observations is presented in table [ tab_nicmosobs ] .",
    "prior to each set of coronagraphic observations , two 0.86  s target acquisition frames were obtained with the f171 m ( @xmath14=1.72 , fwhm=0.07 ) filter .",
    "contemporaneous lamp flats and backgrounds were obtained at f160w for the purpose of locating the coronagraphic hole and enabling good flat - fielding near the hole .",
    "special coronagraphic flat fields at each band were created by modifying a standard high signal to noise ratio on - orbit reference flat field . in a 16@xmath1516 pixel region around and including the coronagraphic hole , the pixel sensitivities were measured in the f160w internal flat field ( hole - finding ) image , scaled to f110w if necessary , and replaced in the reference flat .",

    "dark frames prepared by the nicmos instrument definition team were used to subtract the dark current and correct the detector shading .",
    "after bias subtraction , linearization and flat fielding , known bad pixels were replaced with a gaussian weighted average of neighboring pixels , and the three multiaccum images from each spacecraft orientation were medianed .",
    "the best available photometric calibration was applied to the final images ( f110w : 1 adu s@xmath13 = 2.031@xmath1510@xmath17 jy and , referenced to vega , 0  mag = 1775 jy ; f160w : 1 adu s@xmath13 = 2.190@xmath1510@xmath17 jy and 0  mag = 1083 jy ) .",

    "can be much higher than the disk flux , so the instrumental psf from an unresolved source must be subtracted .",
    "the same observing strategy , including the telescope roll , was used in our gto program for 14 other stars at f110w and 77 at f160w .",
    "these were all processed in the same way as the tw hya images , and we use targets which do not show extended disk emission as a library of possible psf stars .",
    "the detailed character of the nicmos psf changes with time primarily due to thermal variations in the hst optical assembly @xcite and small shifts of the camera cold mask @xcite ; hence some psf star subtractions produce much lower residuals than others @xcite .",
    "the software idp3 @xcite utilizing cubic convolution interpolation was used to register coronagraphic psfs to both orientations of the tw hya observations .",
    "only stars brighter than tw hya were considered , so the signal to noise ratio in the psfs were greater than that of tw hya at every radius , and the psf subtraction residuals were dominated by systematic uncertainties . to minimize the effect of the cold mask shift , we considered psfs taken within one month of tw hya .",
    "five f160w psfs and one f110w psf met all criteria .",
    "the fine structure of the broad band psf is affected by the spectral energy distribution of the source .",
    "when subtracting a reference point source , therefore , mismatches in effective temperature can result in increases in the subtraction residuals . at f160w , where several possible psf observations existed ,",
    "the chosen psf is the k4v star hr 8721 ( = gl 879 ) which is quite close to tw hya ( k7 ) in spectral type . at f110w , however , where many fewer psfs were taken , the spectral type of the chosen psf , @xmath16 eridani , is f4v .",
    "we tested that the effect of the color mismatch is small in two ways .",
    "first , we subtracted coronagraphic psfs of different colors and examined the residuals ; two examples are plotted in figure [ fig_psfcompare ] .",
    "although color mismatch does increase the residuals , it does not introduce a false excess that could mimic a disk , nor does it significantly affect the shape of the observed tw hya disk .",
    "second , we created synthetic psfs of different spectral types with tiny tim @xcite . since tiny tim models diffraction and not scattering from the coronagraph or other elements in the optical path ,",
    "its psfs isolate the effects of color alone .",
    "the tiny tim subtraction residuals were significant only within 0.6  of the star and were smaller than those from real psf subtractions .",
    "the dominant source of photometric uncertainty in the psf - subtracted images results from uncertainty in how to appropriately scale the psf to the brightness of tw hya .",
    "there are two possible methods to determine the scaling factor : a ) the use of a priori photometry of the two stars and b ) the use of measurements made on the subtracted image , including nulling the flux in the diffraction spikes and demanding that the flux approach zero at large radii from the star .",
    "the former suffers from the fact that no images of the stars are taken in the broad - band filters used for the coronagraphic imaging , because the stars saturate the detector in the minimum integration time , so stellar models must be employed for the color transformations from the acquisition filters .",
    "the latter suffers from the fact that the disk contaminates the measurements .",
    "our psf scalings were determined by minimizing the flux in the subtracted diffraction spikes outside the region of apparent disk flux .",
    "we scale the psf images in adu s@xmath13 for @xmath16 eri ( f110w ) by 0.0099 and gl 879 ( f160w ) by 0.031 .",
    "the uncertainty in this scaling is 3% based on the variation between the four diffraction spikes .",
    "this uncertainty in the scaling results in approximately a 10% uncertainty in the disk photometry in each band .",
    "images and spectra of tw hya were taken with the facility long wavelength spectrograph ( lws ) @xcite on the 10  m keck i telescope on ut 11 december 2000 and 45 february 2001 . during all three nights ,",
    "the weather was photometric with low water vapor optical depth .",
    "the images were limited by seeing with fwhm = 0.@xmath1857 and 0.@xmath1850 at 11.7  and 17.9  respectively .",
    "lws uses a @xmath19  pixel boeing si : as detector , and has a plate scale of 0.08 arcsec pixel@xmath13 , resulting in a focal- plane field of view of @xmath20 square .",
    "it also provides a dispersion of 0.037 @xmath0 m pixel@xmath13 ; when combined with a 6 pixel ( 0.@xmath1848 ) slit , the resolution is r @xmath2 120 . when viewed through the long slit , vignetting limits the field of view to 8.5 .",

    "the standard spectrum was shifted in wavelength by 2.5 pixels to match that of tw hya .",
    "after division , the resultant spectrum was multiplied by a blackbody at the temperature of the standard star ( 3100 k ) in order to recover the intrinsic flux distribution .",

    "the nicmos psf subtracted images of tw hya at f110w ( 1.1 ) and f160w ( 1.6 ) are shown on a natural logarithmic stretch in figure [ fig_images ] .",

    "this results in the tapered appearance of the spikes in the final images .",

    "the pixels masked by the diffraction spikes were replaced by the average value of the flux density at their radii and included in the photometry reported above .",

    "the radii of seven independent isophotal contours were calculated as a function of azimuthal angle in the f160w image . for a more significant result ,",
    "the contours were normalized to a radius of one and averaged in sixteen azimuthal bins .",
    "the average isophote was fit with an ellipse using eccentricity ( i.e. inclination ) and position angle as two free parameters .",
    "the resulting best fit had e=0.025@xmath5 0.014 . if this ellipticity is interpreted as due to the inclination of an intrinsically circular disk , the measured inclination is of marginal significance , but a robust 3@xmath24 upper limit to the inclination is 4@xmath4 from face - on .",
    "the azimuthally averaged disk surface brightnesses at both wavelengths are shown in figure [ fig_magsurf ] .",

    "au , it appears to flatten .    to obtain the color of the disk , the images at f110w and f160w were ratioed .",
    "since the images in the two filters were taken at quite different telescope orientations , the diffraction spikes corrupt 50% of the ratioed image .",
    "there are no significant gradients in the color as a function of radius .",
    "the f110w - f160w color averaged over the pixels free from diffraction spike contamination is 0.77 @xmath50.10 mag .",
    "since tw hya was never observed with the nicmos f110w and f160w filters without the coronagraph , the color of the star at these two nicmos bands was estimated based on a stellar photosphere model by @xcite .",
    "the f171 m magnitude of the star was measured from the acquisition images to be 7.39 @xmath5 0.04 mag from both the august and november 1998 data .",
    "the ubvri variability of tw hya , which amounts to @xmath20.5 mag at v and decreases toward the red , has been examined in detail and shown to have an overall period of 12 days with much shorter episodes of rapid change @xcite .",
    "the star becomes bluer by up to 20% as it brightens .",
    "the near - infrared variability has not been thoroughly studied , but its level is expected to be low if the underlying cause of the variation is from hot - spots .",
    "the high level of consistency in the photometry of our acquisition images from the two dates implies that the star did not vary at 1.7 @xmath0 m between august and november .",
    "we assume the star was similarly stable at 1.1 and 1.6 .",
    "a kurucz stellar atmosphere model with t@xmath26=3925  k , log(g)=4 , and log(z)=0 was used to extrapolate the f171 m magnitude to f110w and f160w giving 8.47 and 7.55 mag respectively .",
    "the same model gives h=7.53 and j=8.35 mag ( in the cit system ) which are 10% brighter than the values given by @xcite , which had an uncertainty of 510% .",
    "the inferred j - h color , 0.82 , is identical to that obtained by @xcite , so we believe the model extrapolation to the nicmos filters to be accurate .",
    "the f110w@xmath23f160w stellar color is thus 0.92 mag , while the color of the disk is 0.77@xmath50.10 mag , so the disk color appears to be marginally ( 1.3@xmath24 ) blue .",
    "using hst / wfpc2 , @xcite , also found a slightly blue color for the disk at visual wavelengths ( 0.6 and 0.8 @xmath0 m ) in images made when the star was as bright as it has ever been recorded .",
    "the best estimate of color should come from the largest wavelength range , i.e. 0.61.6  . over the disk region between 0.5 and 3@xmath18 , f606w@xmath23f160w=2.6 @xmath5 0.2 . for tw hya , f606w@xmath23f160w=2.5 , so the disk appears to scatter neutrally over this 1  wavelength baseline .",
    "the radial profiles of tw hya in thermal emission at 11.7 and 17.9 @xmath0 m are shown in figure [ fig_midirimages ] compared with images of the psf star .",
    "tw hya appears to be the same size as the psf , i.e. unresolved , at both wavelengths .",
    "integrated flux densities were measured in a synthetic aperture of radius 2.@xmath184 , and were 0.72 @xmath5 0.04 jy at 11.7  and 1.45 @xmath5 0.08 jy at 17.9 .",
    "the measurement uncertainties reflect both statistical and photometric calibration contributions .",
    "these flux densities agree very well with those given in the @xcite at 12 and 25  interpolated to our wavelengths of observation .",
    "thus , all of the mid - infrared flux in the iras beam arises from quite close to the star . using a kurucz model of a k7 photosphere ( see figure [ fig_sed ] ) to predict the l - band flux and then assuming rayleigh - jeans fall - off from 3.5 to 18",
    ", we determine the stellar flux density at 11.7 and 18.9  as 31 and 13 mjy , respectively .",
    "the mid - infrared color temperature of the disk is 214 k from our measurements .",
    "the 813@xmath0 m spectrum of tw hya is shown in figure [ fig_spectrum ] .",
    "the 11.7  flux density , above , was used to normalize the spectrum , since the full width of that filter is contained in the spectral range .",
    "there is a broad hump in this region that , similarly to @xcite , we attribute to emission by a combination of amorphous and crystalline silicates .",
    "multiplicity in the tw hya association as a whole is @xmath1150% , including stellar and substellar objects @xcite , although tw hya itself has no known companion . at the young age of tw hya",
    "any substellar companions would be quite bright in the infrared , so our nicmos images provide a sensitive way to search for such objects .",
    "we subtracted the two orientations of our f160w data .",
    "while the stellar psf , the instrumental scattering function , and detector artifacts rotate with the aperture , any real features in the unocculted area of the detector are unaffected by a change in the telescope / camera orientation .",
    "subtraction of the these two images has been shown to significantly reduce residual psf background light @xcite . furthermore , since the tw hya disk is almost face - on , it nulls out nearly perfectly in the roll - subtraction , leaving higher noise but no excess flux .",
    "in our data , the roll was only 7 , so point sources in the roll subtraction are separated by more than their fwhm for radii greater than 1.2 . for smaller radii ,",
    "the roll - subtraction was not useful for point source detection and we used the psf subtracted images discussed already . in both regions , we assessed the observability of point sources by planting tiny tim psfs and measuring the magnitude that could be recovered at @xmath273@xmath24 significance .",
    "no point sources were found within 3.4  of tw hya .",
    "the f160w detection limits are shown in figure [ fig_ptsrclimit ] .",
    "given the large fraction ( 0.25 ) of the stellar luminosity re - radiated in the mid and far - infrared , the disk must be optically thick . for single scattering by a geometrically flat and optically thick disk ,",
    "the flux density per square arcsec would be proportional to r@xmath28 @xcite .",
    "this is somewhat steeper than the r@xmath29 we fit in the 40150 au annular region and suggests that the disk is instead flared .",
    "perhaps the strongest argument in favor of disk flaring is that the reflected light surface brightness throughout this annulus is much larger than predicted by a flat disk model .",
    "a warm optically thick disk composed of well mixed dust and gas will naturally flare as a consequence of vertical hydrostatic equilibrium @xcite .",
    "if dust and gas are well mixed and in interstellar proportions , then the height at which stellar photons are scattered is roughly proportional to the vertical pressure scale height . in this case , the scattering height scales as @xmath30 , where @xmath31@xmath32 @xcite .",
    "such a well - mixed , flared disk has a scattering brightness profile that scales approximately as @xmath33 @xcite , significantly shallower than the average tw hya profile at disk radii greater than 40 au .",
    "the discrepancy could reflect vertical settling of dust with respect to the gas such that the actual scattering height at these radii is characterized by @xmath34 .    the f160w surface brightness profile between 80 and 130 au scales like r@xmath22 .",
    "this annulus corresponds to the `` zone 3 '' defined by @xcite ( figure [ fig_compare ] ) , where the visual scattered light also flattens out in their images .",
    "the appearance of the same feature in data from two different instruments lends credibility to the idea that this feature is real . such a variation in the slope of the surface brightness profile",
    "might reflect an undulation or ripple in the height of the disk surface ; at 40 au @xmath35 r @xmath35 80 au , the disk surface might be concave down , while at 80 au @xmath35 r @xmath35 130 au , the disk might be concave up .",
    "distortions of the disk may be caused by instabilities afflicting passively heated disks @xcite or by dynamical effects created by a massive body orbiting in the disk .",
    "the detection limit on a massive body at 100 au from the star is 3m@xmath36 . beyond 150 au ,",
    "the surface brightness profile is significantly steeper than r@xmath28 .",
    "the outer disk is probably completely shadowed .",
    "the face - on geometry of the disk and the average nicmos data power law for the disk surface brightness are consistent with the wfpc2 data of @xcite .",
    "their average power law in the same 40  150 au region ( see figure [ fig_compare ] ) is -2.4 at f606w ( 0.6 ) and -2.6 at f814w ( 0.8 ) .",
    "in addition , the geometry of the disk seen in both hst data sets is consistent with the general morphology reported by @xcite from ground - based observations . however , there are notable differences between the nicmos and trilling et al . data . at their innermost detectable radius of 0.@xmath1894 ,",
    "they report a peak surface brightness at h - band of 6.8@xmath51.1 mjy arcsec@xmath22 . at this same radius , which is well outside our coronagraph , and using the f160w filter which is very similar to h - band , we measure 2.5 @xmath5 0.4 mjy arcsec@xmath22 .",
    "in addition , they measured a total disk flux density in the 0.@xmath18944@xmath18 region of 21.6 @xmath5 3.5 mjy , whereas we measure 12.0 @xmath5 1.2 mjy in that same region .",
    "the trilling et al .",
    "surface brightness power law index , -3.3 @xmath5 0.3 , is discrepant by 2.5 @xmath24 with the nicmos index of -2.6 @xmath5 0.1 .",
    "systematic uncertainties in their ground - based psf subtraction under conditions of 0.@xmath188 seeing may be responsible for the discrepancies .",
    "the large optical depth of the disk makes it difficult to use the scattered light to estimate the density of grains . at any given position in the disk ,",
    "visible and near - infrared stellar radiation penetrates to an optical depth of one .",
    "in contrast , the disk is presumably optically thin at millimeter wavelengths , so millimeter images of the dust emission trace the true surface density .      to elucidate the dust composition , we combine information from the spectral energy distribution , mid - infrared imaging , and mid - infrared spectroscopy .      a simple model of the disk using grains that absorb and emit like blackbodies in thermal equilibrium with a star of luminosity 0.3 l@xmath37 predicts a temperature of 214 k , the 11.7 to 17.9 color temperature , at a distance of only 0.9 au ( 0.@xmath1804 ) . if the entire disk could be described by such grains , it would therefore not be surprising that it appears point - like . in more sophisticated models of passive circumstellar disks ,",
    "@xcite and @xcite predict the mid - infrared flux emitted by a disk as a function of radius . in their two - layer disk models ,",
    "the hotter disk surface layer is heated by direct exposure to starlight , while the cooler disk interior is heated by radiation from the surface . to compare predictions of their models with our mid - infrared images , we modeled tw hya after the prescription of @xcite which accounts explicitly for grain size distributions and laboratory - based silicate and water ice opacities .",
    "our procedure was first to select disk parameters so as to reproduce the observed sed only . in fitting the disk parameters ,",
    "no regard is given to any imaging data .",
    "only after a disk model is chosen that provides a satisfactory fit to the sed do we derive surface brightness profiles at 11.7  and 17.9  based on our fitted model disk .",
    "these profiles are convolved with our respective psfs and compared to our images of tw hya .",
    "figure [ fig_sed ] displays the observed and fitted seds of tw hya .",
    "model input parameters are given in table [ tab_irmodel ] .",
    "for additional details of the model , see @xcite .",
    "the sed model predicts that 99.8% of the 12 @xmath0 m flux density and 94.6% of the 18 @xmath0 m flux density arise within a radius of 9 au ( 2 pixels ) of the star .",
    "as is shown in figure [ fig_midirimages ] , at the resolution of the keck telescope , no extended emission is predicted by the model .",
    "this is consistent with the observations in which no extension is observed .",

    "the remarkably large grains in the disk interior , consisting of millimeter ",
    "centimeter sized cores , and the large total condensable mass in the disk of 0.0014 m@xmath42 = 470 m@xmath43 , were necessary to fit the millimeter - wave sed measured by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the measurement at the particularly long wavelength of 7  mm constrains the grain size distribution in the disk interior to be significantly flatter than the standard interstellar law of @xmath44 , and to possess an upper size cut - off of 6  mm . had we employed a grain size distribution that was much steeper than @xmath45 and that had an upper size cut - off smaller than @xmath46  6  mm , the model fluxes between @xmath47 and 7  mm would have been too low compared to the measurements .",
    "our fitted grain size distributions in the disk interior are subject to the well - known degeneracy between grain size and disk surface density ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) ; reducing the grain sizes or steepening the size distribution increases the fitted dust surface mass density . however , increasing the fitted dust surface density would threaten to make the disk gravitationally unstable , if gas and dust are present in interstellar proportions in tw hya .",
    "we draw the model - dependent conclusion that grain growth has indeed occurred in the tw hya disk .    for the particular grain mixture of millimeter to centimeter - sized olivine spheres mantled with water ice employed by our model , @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "a somewhat lower dust mass of @xmath2130 @xmath50 was derived by @xcite and @xcite using the same observational data .",
    "the difference arises largely because their assumed dust opacities were @xmath23 times greater than ours ( we have multiplied their opacities by 100 to isolate the dust component ) .",
    "their values were based on the @xcite measurement of @xmath51 = 10 @xmath52 g@xmath13 in the dark molecular cloud ngc 7023 and extrapolated to longer wavelengths with @xmath53 , where @xmath12 is taken to be 1.0 by wilner et al . and 0.9 by trilling et al .",
    "the assumed similarity between dust in ngc 7023 and dust in tw hya has no direct observational evidence .",
    "@xcite showed that a single power law description of the opacity is inaccurate for real dust materials .",
    "they computed opacities for a variety of grain species , including water ice , silicates , organics , iron , and troilite . for their `` composite ( 50% ) '' grains , extrapolated values of @xmath54 range between 0.03 and 0.06 @xmath52 g@xmath13 , assuming that the values of @xmath12 that they compute between 650 @xmath0 m and 2.3 mm can be extended to 7 mm .",
    "these opacities are a factor of @xmath23 smaller than the ones employed in our disk model fit , and a factor of 510 smaller than the ones adopted by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite model only @xmath233 @xmath50 of ism - like dust to reproduce their observed surface brightness profiles in scattered light at @xmath55 = 0.6 and 0.8 @xmath0 m .",
    "the profiles depend more strongly on the distribution of dust at high altitude above the midplane than on the distribution of dust in the midplane where most of the mass probably resides .",
    "krist et al .",
    "assume a gaussian vertical density profile for micron - sized dust .",
    "however , substantially more dust could reside at the midplane of their disk model without detracting from the goodness of their surface brightness fits .",
    "thus , their @xmath233 @xmath50 could easily represent a lower limit on the actual dust mass .",
    "we conclude that the tw hya disk probably contains several hundred earth masses of condensed silicates and ices .",
    "this dust mass is several times larger than the typical dust masses estimated for t tauri star disks in the taurus and ophiuchus star forming regions on the basis of 1.3 mm dust continuum observations @xcite .",
    "large , centimeter sized , grains were necessary to fit the @xmath56 slope of the millimeter - wave sed . a grain size distribution with smaller grains is characterized by a significantly steeper slope , @xmath57 , and is difficult to reconcile with the observations .",
    "the presence of these very large particles is good evidence for grain growth within the disk .",
    "total mass estimates for tw hya s disk in the literature vary by another two orders of magnitude depending on the assumed gas : dust ratio .",
    "the standard interstellar gas : dust mass ratio of 100:1 may be incorrect for an older disk like that around tw hya . @xcite find only 11 m@xmath43 in h@xmath58 gas based on @xmath59co observations and a standard interstellar h@xmath58/co ratio .",
    "the low mass accretion rate estimated by @xcite , an order of magnitude less than for typical t tauri stars , also suggests that the gas in this system has been depleted .",
    "the gas - to - dust mass ratio does not formally enter into our model sed - fitted disk ; only enough gas and/or vertical circulation of gas is assumed to lift dust grains @xmath235 vertical scale heights above the midplane to comprise the flared , superheated disk atmosphere .",
    "if we assume the primordial tw hya disk had the canonical 100:1 gas to dust ratio , then it once contained 0.14 m@xmath42 .",
    "this early disk with @xmath225% of the star s mass would have been marginally gravitationally stable .",
    "the broad silicate emission feature can not be explained by amorphous silicates alone since they have a pronounced peak at 9.6  and fall off rapidly to longer wavelengths .",
    "our spectrum agrees very well with the published result of @xcite , who note the near absence of a peak at 11.2 @xmath0 m , within the uncertainties of their data .",
    "our spectrum hints at a peak at 11.2 @xmath0 m ; furthermore , to create the full width of the feature requires substantial flux longward of 10 .",
    "crystalline species are probably responsible . data of this spectral resolution are inadequate to constrain the exact crystalline structure , however . magnesium and iron - rich species all have peaks in the 10  11.3  region .",
    "silicate emission features become less prominent as the grains get larger , so that by a size of @xmath25  their mid - infrared spectrum is nearly flat @xcite .",
    "the tw hya spectrum suggests that its emitting grains must therefore be @xmath355@xmath0 m in size .",
    "tw hya is surrounded by a optically thick dust disk which must be flared to account for the large apparent size of the disk seen in scattered light and for its thermal sed .",
    "a ripple in the surface brightness at 85 au and the steep decline in surface brightness beyond 150 au could be due to thermal instabilities or dynamical effects .",
    "however , no companion to tw hya is detected down to a mass of @xmath210 m@xmath36 at distances greater than 50 au from the star .",
    "although tw hya looks like a classical t tauri star in terms of its h@xmath3 emission , its disk shows signs of evolution . to fit the large submillimeter and millimeter flux densities measured from tw hya , our sed models require a grain size distribution in the disk interior dominated by large , millimeter - centimeter sized , icy grains .",
    "large grains , which dominate the mass of the disk , presumably grew from coagulation of smaller grains in the disk .",
    "the initial mass of tw hya s disk in gas and dust may be several times the typical t tauri star disk mass , which may help account for its long , @xmath28 myr , lifetime .",
    "the thermal emission remains spatially unresolved at the resolution of the keck telescope , in accord with theoretical expectations .",
