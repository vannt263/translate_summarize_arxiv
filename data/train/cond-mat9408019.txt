    "knowledge of the symmetry of the energy gap in superconductors provides a major step towards unraveling the puzzle of superconductivity in unconventional superconductors . while the evidence continues to accrue",
    ", the identification of the pair state in the heavy  fermion and cuprate systems has proven to be somewhat elusive @xcite .",
    "while recent photoemission experiments @xcite do allow for an angular  dependent determination of the gap and josephson tunneling measurements have probed the phase of the gap @xcite , by far the most abundant information that has led to speculation of a non  bcs ground state has been focussed on the presence of power  laws in the low frequency and/or temperature behavior of transport and thermodynamic quantities @xcite . however , due to the averaging over the entire fermi surface , it is well known that the power  laws themselves do not uniquely identify the ground state symmetry of the order parameter but only can give the topology of the nodes of the energy gap along the fermi surface , e.g. , whether the gap vanishes on points and/or lines on the fermi surface .",
    "thus one can not distinguish between different representations of the energy gap which have the same topology .",
    "for instance , for the case of @xmath10wave tetragonal superconductors , there are five pure representations which have line nodes on the fermi surface .",
    "further , the energy gap can become smeared due to inelastic quasiparticle collisions , making a fully gapped superconductor seem like a one with gap nodes . while in principle the latter effect can be minimized by limiting the experiment to very low temperatures , the two - particle correlation functions determining the density , spin or current responses do not have the freedom to probe various portions of the gap around the fermi surface , presenting a fundamental obstacle to uniquely identifying the pair state representation for the superconductor .    however , it is well known that raman scattering has the ability to measure various degrees of freedom by simply rotating the incident and scattered photon polarization orientations .",
    "formally , raman fluctuations may be viewed as anisotropic mass fluctuations around the fermi surface which do not obey a conservation law @xcite , such as , e.g. , density fluctuations .",
    "while the isotropic density fluctuations between unit cells will be screened due to their coupling to long  range coulomb forces , the intracell mass fluctuations can be anisotropic around the fermi surface with no net charge and thus can be unscreened , providing a scattering mechanism for incoming photons .",
    "the intensity of scattered light in a raman experiment can be written in terms of a differential photon scattering cross section @xmath11 as @xmath12{\\rm im}\\ \\chi_{\\gamma\\gamma}({\\bf q},\\omega).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath13 is the thompson radius , @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the frequency of the incoming and scattered photon , respectively , and we have set @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath17 is the generalized structure function , which is related to the imaginary part to the raman response function @xmath18 through the fluctuation  dissipation theorem , the second part of eq .",
    "finally @xmath19 $ ] is the bose ",
    "einstein distribution function .",
    "the generalization of the usual density ",
    "density correlation ( @xmath20 ) and response ( @xmath21 ) functions to the case of raman scattering can be generated by weighting the sums over momenta @xmath22 with the square of the raman vertex @xmath23 .    for small momentum transfers and incident light energies smaller than the optical band gap ( non  resonant scattering ) , the vertex for raman scattering can be written in terms of the curvature of the energy band dispersion @xmath24 , @xmath25 where @xmath26 denote the scattered and incident polarization light vectors , respectively , which select elements of the raman tensor .",
    "the symmetry of the underlying crystal can be taken into account by expanding @xmath27 in terms of a complete set of crystal harmonics @xmath28 defined on the fermi surface , i.e. , @xcite @xmath29 where the index @xmath30 represents the @xmath30th order contribution to the vertex which transforms according to the @xmath31th irreducible representation of the point group symmetry of the crystal .",
    "the quantum numbers @xmath32 classify the anisotropy of the raman fluctuations around the fermi surface .",
    "the full @xmath33dependence is thus described by the addition of the basis functions ( which become progressively more anisotropic for higher @xmath30 ) with different weights @xmath34 . while the charge , spin , and current density response probes only a single @xmath30 channel ( @xmath35 , for the charge and spin density , while @xmath36 , for the current density ) , in principle all even @xmath30 channels can contribute to the raman vertex for bands which are non  parabolic .",
    "thus by choosing the polarization light vectors accordingly , one can select different @xmath32 channels which allow for different projections onto the fermi surface .",
    "therefore , electronic raman scattering can provide detailed information which allows insight to the angular dependence of the pair  state symmetry .    in accord with this fact ,",
    "the experimental results on the cuprate systems reveal a wealth of polarization ",
    "dependent information that provides detailed evidence for determining the actual symmetry of the gap @xcite .",
    "the existing body of data on the cuprate systems @xcite reveal five main points : 1 ) in contrast to conventional superconductors such as nb@xmath4sn , no clear well  defined gap is seen for any polarization orientation even at the lowest temperatures measured ( @xmath37 ) @xcite , 2 ) the peak of the spectrum lies roughly at 30% higher frequency shifts for the polarization orientation which selects b@xmath38 symmetry compared to all other symmetries [ 10 - 13 ] , 3 ) there are indications that the temperature dependence of the peak in the b@xmath38 channel follows more closely to a bcs form than any other symmetry @xcite , 4 ) the low frequency raman shifts vary roughly as @xmath39 for b@xmath38 symmetries and linearly in @xmath40 for the others [ 9 - 13 ] , and 5 ) the ratio of residual scattering in the superconducting state to the normal state is smallest for the b@xmath38 case compared to all other configurations @xcite .",
    "such a rich spectrum of information should provide a stringent test for various candidates of the pairing symmetry states @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to investigate the polarization dependence of the raman spectra for a superconductor in the weak coupling limit with anisotropic pairing symmetry .",
    "we calculate the electronic raman scattering for a tetragonal superconductor at finite temperatures and for various polarization orientations in a gauge invariant manner and find a rich polarization dependence of the spectra that can be used to uniquely identify the energy gap .",
    "in particular , we examine the raman response for @xmath1 , @xmath10 , @xmath2 , and anisotropic @xmath1wave superconductors and find that a @xmath0 state agrees surprising well with the current information on electronic raman scattering in yba@xmath3cu@xmath4o@xmath5 , bi@xmath3sr@xmath3cacu@xmath3o@xmath6 and tl@xmath3ba@xmath3cuo@xmath7 .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : the ground work for the gauge invariant theory of electronic raman scattering in anisotropic superconductors is reviewed in section 2 using a kinetic equation approach .",
    "section 3 concerns the connection of band structure to the raman vertex and its relation to fermi surfaces .",

    "section 5 presents a comparison of the theory to the data on three cuprate systems and contains our conclusions .",
    "appendix a deals with a solution of the weak coupling gap equation for the case of anisotropic gaps , appendix b contains details of the theory for the case of ( elastic or inelastic ) quasiparticle scattering in the normal state , while lastly appendix c is devoted to our calculations for the massive collective modes and the subsequent role of vertex corrections using a diagrammatic approach .",

    "we proceed with a solution of eq .",

    "let us write the kinetic equation ( 8) in a form in which the l.h.s is reminiscent of the usual landau  silin equation @xcite , @xmath112= -\\lambda_k[\\omega\\delta\\epsilon_k^++\\eta_k\\delta\\epsilon_k^- ] + \\lambda_k[\\omega^2-\\eta_k^2]\\frac{\\delta\\delta_k^-}{2|\\delta_k|}.\\ ] ] inserting eq .

    "this demonstrates clearly the equivalence of the existence of the anderson ",
    "bogoliubov mode with gauge invariance as well as the connection of gauge  invariance with the conservation law for the ( charge ) density .",
    "next we would like to demonstrate two simple consequences of a gauge  invariant formulation of superconducting response theory , namely those for the current response in the static ( @xmath121 ) and for the raman response in the homogeneous ( @xmath122 ) limit .",

    "@xmath124 clearly , the second term in ( 24 ) , sometimes referred to as backflow term @xcite , is necessary to maintain charge conservation in the general case of an anisotropic superconductor .",
    "equivalently , it guarantees that the current is purely transverse in the static limit .",
    "let us now turn to the raman response in the homogeneous limit .",
    "here we may ignore terms linear in @xmath125 and @xmath115",
    ". for @xmath122 the kinetic equation ( 20 ) assumes then the strikingly simple form @xmath126 in which the second term on the r.h.s",
    ". originates from the order parameter phase fluctuations .",
    "the coulomb interaction becomes irrelevant in this limit , as will become clear later , and we may write @xmath127",
    ". the homogeneous raman response of anisotropic superconductors can then be written in a form analogous to the london limit of the current response as @xmath128 as in the case of the current response there is a `` backflow '' term ( the second in the curly brackets ) , which guarantees charge conservation .",
    "this is easily seen in the limit of parabolic bands , where the raman vertex @xmath129 is a constant and as a consequence the two terms in curly brackets cancel precisely .",
    "this is just another way of stating that there are no density fluctuations possible in the homogeneous limit @xmath122 of a superconductor .",

    "the anderson ",
    "bogoliubov collective mode causes the second term in the transverse contribution @xmath141 ( note that @xmath142 = @xmath143= @xmath144 ) and the longitudinal term which is characterized by the gauge mode frequency @xmath145 .",
    "finally we explicitely work out the coulomb renormalization @xmath134 which couples raman and density fluctuations and arrive at the following final result : @xmath146 it should be noted that the raman response in superconductors in the small @xmath147 limit in a form equivalent to eq . (",
    "30 ) has first been derived by klein and dierker @xcite using the greens  function method .",
    "our result from the kinetic equation method looks slightly different and , particularly , one can see that the coulomb interaction acts so as to split the raman response into an unscreened `` transverse '' and a dielectrically screened `` longitudinal '' part , the latter being described by the full dielectric function of @xmath148 of the superconductor in complete analogy to the behavior of the current response , discussed in ref . @xcite .",
    "furthermore , an inspection of eq .",
    "( 30 ) shows , that all terms in the full response function @xmath149 except @xmath150 are at least of the order @xmath151 , the last ( longitudinal ) term being even smaller , of the order @xmath152 .",
    "the role of the coulomb interaction is thus limited to show up in terms of the order of at most @xmath151 and is seen to be negligible in the homogeneous limit .",
    "the role of the collective anderson  bogoliubov mode , on the other hand , mainly consists of providing a particle number conservation law .",
    "this manifests itself first in the correct mass fluctuation limit of eq .",
    "( 30 ) , in which @xmath129=const and all transverse terms vanish identically leaving essentially the screened rpa lindhard response of the superconductor in which the collective mode gets shifted to the plasma frequency .",
    "second it manifests itself in `` partial screening '' effects in the homogeneous limit of the raman response , described by the second term of @xmath150 .",
    "these effects will be discussed in detail later .      since @xmath154 in the cuprates ( with @xmath81 the coherence length ) , we are mostly interested in raman scattering with vanishing momentum transfers .",
    "for such a case it is essential to conclude at this stage that the most important contribution to the electronic raman effect in superconductors in the small@xmath61 collisionless limit comes from the response function @xmath155 .",
    "physically , this function describes the photon  induced breaking of a cooper pair into a pair of bogoliubov quasiparticles with total momentum @xmath61 which is approximately zero .",
    "writing the raman vertex @xmath27 as a sum @xmath156 of an isotropic and an anisotropic part ( using fermi surface harmonics @xmath157 , one may decompose the screened raman response function at zero temperature in the limit of small momentum transfers as @xmath158 with @xmath159 ^ 2}{\\chi_{1 1}^{(0 ) } } \\frac{1}{\\epsilon}=o\\left(\\frac{q^{2}}{\\epsilon}\\right ) , \\nonumber \\\\",

    "it does not take into account any vertex corrections resulting from the pairing interaction in other channels other than the pairing channel , as explained in the preceeding discussion .",

    "important information can also be obtained from the temperature dependence of the response in the limit of zero frequency shifts , i.e. , the static reponse .",
    "it can be shown that the ratio of the response in a superconductor to that of a normal metal in the limit of vanishing frequencies is given by the simple expression @xmath175 where @xmath176 is a fermi function @xcite .",
    "this is an exact result which does not depend on vertex corrections and only depends appreciably on impurity scattering for nearly resonant impurity scatterers @xcite .",
    "the important feature in all these expressions is that in general a coupling of the raman vertex to the energy gap can occur under the momentum averaging over the fermi surface . in all previous studies ,",
    "this @xmath33dependence was either ignored or not fully exploited to determine important information concerning the symmetry of the energy gap .",
    "this will be explicitly demonstrated in the following section where we evaluate these expressions for the screened raman response for various pair state candidates and discuss its relevance to the cuprate materials .",
    "we close this section by returning to the question of the presence of massive modes and final  state vertex corrections ( see above ) . in principle",
    ", the massive modes can lie at low frequencies and affect the low frequency behavior of correlation functions , and in particular , could even be used as a signal for a certain type of order parameter symmetry .",
    "we have carried out an analysis of the full gauge invariant calculation in the appendix c for both cylindrical and spherical fermi surfaces for a generalized pairing interaction .",
    "we identified the position of the collective modes as a function of coupling strength for a gap of @xmath0 ( @xmath177 representation using the notation of sigrist and rice , @xcite ) symmetry for both a spherical and cylindrical fermi surface .",
    "our conclusions are threefold : 1 ) the goldstone modes do affect the raman spectrum in the limit of @xmath122 , in certain polarization symmetries ( @xmath178 ) where the `` backflow term '' in ( 32 ) is finite , 2 ) optical ( massive ) collective modes couple to a light probe only for case of a fermi surface with @xmath179dispersion for @xmath10wave vertex corrections in the @xmath180 and @xmath181 channels , 3 ) these modes are significantly damped and have a vanishing residue for those modes which lie at low energies",
    ". therefore , the collective modes are of little importance to the raman spectrum .",
    "these conclusions can be generalized to other energy gaps which have line nodes on the fermi surface .",
    "also , we discuss the role of the final  state interactions and find that while the overall shape of the spectra can be affected , the corrections are relatively minor . the details are contained in appendix c , including a more general discussion of the role of vertex corrections .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that eqs .",
    "( 32 - 35 ) give an adequate desciption of the raman response .",
    "in this section we aim at providing a link between the raman vertex and band structure for tetragonal crystals .",
    "in particular , we show how the choice of light polarization orientations results in selection rules for the symmetry components of the raman tensor . in the first subsection we only consider scattering within a single band while we consider the case of multiple bands at the fermi surface in the following subsection .      as we have seen in the previous section ( see eq .",

    "these examples show in particular that @xmath178 symmetry can not be individually accessed for in  plane polarizations , and subtraction procedures must be used .",
    "the above consideration can be easily adopted to the case of multiple energy bands contributing to the fermi surface , for instance , due to the contribution of the chains as well as the planes in ybco@xcite .",
    "the total electronic raman cross section for intraband scattering is just the sum of the contribution to the cross section for each band and thus results from the addition of the raman response functions , @xmath217 where @xmath218 denotes the contribution to the scattering from band @xmath219 with an energy gap @xmath220 for each band .",
    "the raman vertex for each band is separately calculable in the same manner as in the previous section , and the same considerations there can be carried over to the multi  sheeted case trivially .",
    "we draw the important point however that the contribution from each band will be weighted by the relative density of states and curvature of each band at the fermi level . therefore ,",
    "for the case of the cuprates we believe that by far the largest contribution to electronic raman scattering is thus arising from the single anti  bonding cu - o layer band with the largest density of states and greatest curvature at the fermi level .",
    "further , it is not even clear whether an energy gap exists on the other energy bands ( e.g. , associated with the chains in ybco ) , and if it does exist what symmetry it has .",
    "therefore , we feel that to a very good approximation , the intraband scattering has a dominant contribution from the anti  bonding band .",
    "this is certainly the case for the single cu - o layer compound , tl@xmath3ba@xmath3cuo@xmath7 .",
    "we close this subsection with a discussion concerning interband scattering , or scattering from the anti  bonding band to another band near or at the fermi level . in this case",
    "a separate theory is necessary to take into account the separate band dispersion and energy difference of the two bands , and the energy gap on each of the bands .",
    "this at present remains a future consideration .",
    "however , we remark at this point that once again this contribution to the scattering cross section will be smaller than the contribution from scattering within the anti  bonding band due to the small curvature of the other energy bands and the value of the density of states at the fermi level ( again , the chains for example ) .",
    "also , since the nature of the energy gap on the chains is completely unclear , we consider interband scattering to be beyond the scope of the present manuscript @xcite .",
    "in this section we evaluate eqs . (",

    "for the case of an angular independent gap , @xmath221 , the raman response is given by the simple bcs expression .",
    "it has the stereotypic features of bcs theory , namely , the existence of an energy gap threshold @xmath222 required to break a cooper pair , and the ubiquitous square root divergence associated with the gap edge .",
    "we note in particular that the raman vertex couples trivially to the energy gap and just determines an overall prefactor governing the raman intensity .",
    "the vertex does not affect the lineshape and thus the spectrum is polarization independent apart from an overall prefactor .",
    "a polarization dependence can be generated in bcs theory by taking into account channel  dependent final  state interactions @xcite and/or impurity scattering @xcite , and accurate fits to the raman data on a-15 superconductors can be obtained . however , for the most part this only produces an channel dependence in the vicinity of the gap edge and thus the main feature of the response is the uniform gap existing for all polarizations , which clearly can not give an adequate description to the raman spectra of the cuprate materials .      the explicit symmetry dependence of the spectra results due to a coupling of the energy gap and vertex when the energy gap is anisotropic . to demonstate this , we now carry out the averages over a cylindrical fermi surface in eq .",

    "this corresponds to partial `` transverse screening '' of the @xmath178 channel , and via this mechanism the intercell fluctuations are removed .",

    "these functions are plotted in fig .",

    "we see that the peak in the raman spectra lies at different frequencies @xmath234 and @xmath235 for the @xmath236 and @xmath178 channels , respectively @xcite .",
    "the symmetry dependence of the spectra is a direct consequence of the angular averaging which couples the gap and raman vertex , and leads to constructive ( destructive ) interference under averaging if the vertex and the gap have the same ( different ) symmetry .",
    "thus it has been reasoned that the symmetry which shows the highest peak position gives an unique indication of the predominant symmetry of the gap @xcite .",
    "the peak positions can be mildly affected by including interaction vertex corrections as discussed in appendix c , with the net result being a slight upward shift of the peak location in the @xmath216 and @xmath178 channels . also ,",
    "while the presence of @xmath179dispersion has little effect on the @xmath180 ( apart from cutting off the logarithmic divergence ) and @xmath216 channels , the @xmath178 peak position can be changed due to the addition of a terms which has its main contribution at slightly lower frequencies .",
    "this effect is small provided that the fermi surface is mostly cylindrical .",
    "we refer the reader to appendix c for details .",
    "the symmetry dependence is also manifest in the low frequency behavior , which can be written as @xmath237 i.e. , the spectrum rises slower in the @xmath180 channel than the @xmath178 or @xmath216 channels , which have the same linear rise with frequency . the power ",
    "laws are insensitive to vertex corrections and arise solely due to topology arguments .",
    "the appearance of power laws are a signature of an energy gap which vanishes on lines ( points in 2d ) on the fermi surface . however , the channel dependence of the exponents are unique to a @xmath0 pair state .",
    "these channel - dependent power laws have been observed in the electronic contribution to raman scattering in bscco @xcite , ybco @xcite and tbco @xcite and are strong evidence for a @xmath10wave gap of this symmetry as opposed to @xmath238 or @xmath239 symmetry , which also have nodes on lines on the fermi surface @xcite .",
    "we now investigate the temperature dependence of the theory and contrast to that of an isotropic @xmath1wave superconductor . using a weak coupling expression for the temperature dependence of the energy gap @xmath240 ( see appendix a ) , we numerically evaluate eq .",

    "the power  law behavior for the @xmath10wave case is channel dependent , with exponents identical to those of eq .",
    "( 55 ) , in the sense that @xmath40 can be replaced by @xmath232 .",
    "what is remarkable is that the fall off of the fermi function at low temperatures is quite slow in those channels which are orthogonal to the symmetry of the gap , where the @xmath178 and @xmath216 channels show a residual broadening at @xmath243 of roughly 20 percent of that of the normal state .",
    "this was argued in the case of electronic raman scattering to be further evidence for an energy gap in the cuprate materials which has predominantly @xmath180 character , due to the observation that a gap opens up quickly in the @xmath180 channel compared to others channels which have been probed via raman scattering @xcite .",
    "as we have remarked before , since the raman density response function only depends on the magnitude of the energy gap , it can not be sensitive to the phase of the order parameter and thus can not be directly used to determine if the gap changes sign around the fermi surface . while the power  law behavior at low frequencies and/or temperatures is indicative to the presence of nodes , in principle a very highly anisotropic order parameter with a small uniform gap everywhere on the fermi surface could mimic the behavior of a gap with nodes when inelastic scattering or experimental resolution smears the threshold . in principle the detection of a threshold can then only be performed at very low temperatures where activated behavior can be observed .",
    "since this remains a possibility we now discuss two types of energy gaps which are anisotropic but have a finite gap around the fermi surface .",
    "kotliar and joynt have suggested the possibility that an order parameter which is a superposition of an @xmath1wave and a @xmath10wave gap can also provide an adequate description to the various transport and thermodynamic measurements on the cuprate systems @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 state has the interesting feature that in pure tetragonal superconductors there would be two transition temperatures associated with the formation of each gap separately .",
    "this is a consequence of the admixture of two different representations of the energy gap .",

    "one may show that the normal state raman response in the @xmath122 limit assumes form equivalent to the result ( 26 ) for the pair breaking raman effect : @xmath307 like in the superconducting case , the projected structure of eq .",
    "( b3 ) has its origin in the particle number conservation law .",
    "this result can be applied to impurity or phonon scattering as well as to inelastic two - particle scattering and requires the specification of the momentum - dependent quasiparticle lifetime for each of these cases .    in this appendix",
    "we derive expressions for gauge  invariant generalized correlation functions using a diagrammatic approach with the main emphasis placed on electronic raman scattering . after solving the coupled integral equations for the renormalized vertex",
    ", we evaluate the position , broadening and residue of the massive and massless collective modes as a function of coupling strength for a @xmath0 energy gap on a spherical fermi surface .",
    "we then investigate the collective modes on a cylindrical ( 2-d ) fermi surface by turning off any @xmath179dispersion in the band structure .",
    "we begin by writing down the expression for the general two - particle response function in nambu space as @xmath308,\\ ] ] @xmath309 where @xmath310 denotes taking the trace , @xmath311 are pauli matrices in nambu space , and the vertex @xmath312 determines the correlation function of interest .",
    "the dressed vertex @xmath313 contains the interactions @xmath314 responsible for maintaining gauge invariance .",
    "our consideration is focused on the raman vertex which describes the anisotropic mass fluctuations , @xmath315 with the limit of small @xmath316 taken .",
    "other choices of the vertices are @xmath317 thus from eqs .",
    "( c3 ) we see that while the spin and charge density vertices probe only the @xmath318 channel and current density probes @xmath319 , in principle all even @xmath30 channels contribute to the raman vertex .",
    "in fact the charge density is the first term in the expansion of the raman vertex .    if one replaces the dressed vertex @xmath320 by the undressed one , eq .",
    "( 2 ) , then of course eq . (",
    "c1 ) is manifestly not gauge invariant , and in general the neglect of collective modes arising from a gauge invariant treatment could in principle affect the overall spectrum .",
    "usually the question of gauge invariance is rather an academic one since the modes that appear in bcs systems have little impact on the response functions of a superconductor .",
    "it is well known that due to the spontaneously broken @xmath321 gauge symmetry in @xmath1wave superconductors , two collective modes appear  an optical one with a frequency of @xmath222 which is damped  and a sound  like mode , the anderson ",
    "bogolubov mode , which is soft and lies in the gap for neutral superconductors but is raised to the plasmon energy by the long range coulomb forces via the higgs mechanism .",
    "however , in unconventional superconductors , there can exist in principle additional goldstone modes corresponding to the additional broken continuous symmetries such as @xmath322 spin rotational symmetry in spin ",
    "triplet systems plus @xmath323 orbital rotational symmetry in spin  singlet systems if the gap does not possess the full symmetry of the fermi surface . in addition , massive collective modes can arise if the energy gap is degenerate or has an admixture of different representations from the point group .",
    "the massive modes can in principle lie below the gap edge and thus be relevant for the low frequency dynamics of correlation functions .",
    "for example , the spectrum of collective modes in @xmath324he is well known in both phases and lead to observable effects @xcite . however , the collective modes of possible @xmath10wave states that might be candidates for strongly correlated systems are not as well understood @xcite",
    ". there are indications that a @xmath10wave state of @xmath0 is particularly favorable in systems with strong correlations @xcite , thus underscoring the necessity of an understanding of the response functions and collective modes for such a superconductor .",
    "we continue our calculation for the gauge invariant raman response by first expanding the renormalized matrix vertex @xmath313 along the fermi surface in terms of crystal harmonics , @xmath325 and do the same for the pairing interaction , @xmath326 the integral equation for the renormalized vertex at @xmath327 can then be written as @xmath328 where @xmath171 denotes an average over the fermi surface and @xmath169 denotes the density of states at the fermi level .",
    "( c6 ) is completely general for any type of vertex , interaction and gap symmetry . in particular , for the case of an isotropic energy gap , eq .",
    "( c6 ) recovers the previous results for the density , current @xcite , and raman reponses @xcite .",
    "we confine ourselves to the case of singlet energy gaps and use the bcs approximation , @xmath329 where @xmath330 .",
    "more complicated green s functions could treated with the same scheme .",
    "however , the analysis gets considerably more complicated and can not be carried as far analytically .",
    "in general the pairing interaction @xmath314 can have off  diagonal as well as diagonal terms in the @xmath30 basis , and in general all channels will be coupled . if the interaction has the symmetry of the fermi surface then the integral equations only couple different channels @xmath30 and @xmath331 which transform according to the same irreducible representation .",
    "however , the subsequent matrix can be diagonalized with respect to the indices of the same representation resulting in a new set of basis functions which are linear combinations of the old basis functions of the same representation in different @xmath30 channels @xcite .",
    "thus we can then write the interaction as a diagonal matrix in the new basis functions which still has a general structure for each representation within each new channel . thus we can write @xmath332 .",
    "this allows us to reduce the infinite series of coupled integral equations to a limited subset that can be handled analytically .",
    "the elements of the expansion will be dominated by a single @xmath333 component corresponding to the @xmath30 pairing channel symmetry @xmath31 , and the other components represent admixtures of channels ( the smaller eigenvalues in the gap equation ) with different pairing symmetry .",
    "if the gap representation is one dimensional ( all representations of the @xmath191 group except @xmath181 , which is two dimensional ) , then all the other @xmath333 s are set to zero and there will only be collective modes connected with the broken @xmath321 gauge invariance .",
    "otherwise other collective modes can be present as well .",
    "we now define new vertices @xmath334 and expand @xmath335 in spin quaternions , @xmath336 the index @xmath31 stands for the representations of the @xmath191 point group , and are defined through the basis functions as follows @xmath337 where the @xmath338 corresponds to the notation of sigrist and rice @xcite . it can be shown that the coefficients @xmath339 of pauli matrices @xmath340 satisfy homogeneous equations and thus vanish while the remaining coefficients satisfy the following coupled integral equations , @xmath341 @xmath342 where the functions @xmath343 are given by @xmath344 the spectral functions are defined as @xmath345 here @xmath176 is a fermi function and @xmath346 denotes additional terms which differ only in the sign of @xmath347 . analytically continuing to the real axis by letting @xmath348 ,",

    "we now specifically work with a @xmath180 gap , @xmath360 ( the @xmath177 representation @xcite ) , noting that similar conclusion can be drawn for other choices of energy gaps within the @xmath165 subgroup of the @xmath191 point group .",
    "the coupled integral equations represent 10 equations for the 10 unknowns @xmath361 , and the solution can be obtained by diagonalizing a @xmath362 matrix . in aiding to solve the coupled integral equations ,",
    "it is useful to examine the selection rules of the spectral functions @xmath343 for various subgroup indices within the @xmath363 channels .",
    "in particular we note that @xmath364 these theorems hold for the case of a @xmath180 gap only .    handling the full gauge invariant",
    "response amounts to solving a matrix equation to identify the collective modes in each channel .",
    "solving these equations allows one to identify the position of the collective modes by locating the zeroes of the real part of the denominator .",
    "we first simplify our notation by defining @xmath365 we find that the @xmath366 and @xmath367 channels are coupled due to the fact that a @xmath0 energy gap squared has a component which has a finite overlap with the @xmath178 channel which is isotropic within the @xmath368 plane .",
    "solving the integral equations we obtain for the @xmath369 and @xmath370 channels , @xmath371 for the @xmath372 and @xmath373 ( two @xmath181 ) channels , we find no coupling and obtain @xmath374 @xmath375 where @xmath376 and @xmath377 stand for the interactions , renormalized vertices , and spectral functions in the @xmath373 channels , respectively .",
    "these equations represent the full channel dependent renormalization of the raman vertex due to @xmath378wave pairing interactions .",
    "we now are in a position to identify the collective modes in the 10 channels ( 5 real and 5 imaginary ) by locating the zeroes of the denominator in each channel .",
    "while the functions @xmath379 remain general and are determined by the magnitude of the raman vertex they do not enter into the denominators of the expressions for the renormalized vertices and thus are irrelevant for the position and broadening of the collective modes .",
    "the modes located by the zeroes of the denominator are of two types , namely , massive and massless .",
    "the massless ( goldstone ) modes are a consequence of the spontaneously broken @xmath321 continuous symmetry by the interactions , while the massive ( optical ) modes are generated as well . using eqs .",
    "( c21-c23 ) , in each channel we locate the zeroes of the real part of the denominator in each channel to find the position of the collective mode and evaluate the imaginary part of the denominator at the position of the collective mode to determine its broadening .",
    "our results are summarized in table 1 .",
    "we see that the goldstone mode ( @xmath380 ) appears in the @xmath178 channel and the other modes are all massive .",
    "the @xmath180 modes lie beneath the maximum energy gap while the others appear above @xmath261 .",
    "these excitonic modes are damped considerably due to the existence of quasiparticles from the presence of gap nodes which provide decay channels to damp the massive modes .",
    "this is in contrast to excitonic modes in @xmath1wave superconductors @xcite .",
    "however , we do observe in table 1 that the mode position rapidly decreases to lower frequencies with depreciating residue as the coupling stregnth @xmath381 is reduced , which is similar to the bcs case . below a critical coupling strength @xmath382",
    "the collective modes disappear altogether and thus have little impact on the low frequency behavior of the raman correlation function for small couplings .",
    "we now reconstruct the raman response and determine which of the collective modes couple to the raman vertex . putting in eqs .",
    "( c21)-(c23 ) into ( c1 ) , we can express the full gauge invariant raman response function as @xmath383 taking only the @xmath384 terms of the raman vertex into account ( see section iii ) , we carry out the summation over @xmath331 and @xmath385 to obtain the raman spectrum in each channel , and then take into account the long  range coulomb screening via @xcite @xmath386 where @xmath387 denotes eq .",
    "( c1 ) with the vertices @xmath388 and @xmath389 , respectively .",
    "we find that for the density channel ( @xmath318 ) , @xmath390 , which is a restatement of particle number conservation and bears out the gauge invariant nature of the theory .",
    "this simply restates that intercell charge fluctuations couple to the long  range coulomb forces to be completely screened for @xmath283 . after lengthy but trivial algebra",
    "we obtain the compact results for the intracell fluctuation contributions . for the @xmath180 channel we obtain , @xmath391 and for the @xmath216 channel , @xmath392 and for the two @xmath181 channels , @xmath393 with the functions @xmath394",
    "@xmath395 @xmath396 these channels are unaffected by screening since the intracell fluctuations lead to no net charge transfer for these symmetries .",
    "the expression for the fully symmetric @xmath178 channel which contains both inter  and intracell fluctuations expression is much more complicated due to coulomb screening , @xmath397{1- { \\gamma_{0}\\over{\\gamma_{2 } } } v_{2}c_{a_{1g}}^{0}(i\\omega)\\over{1+v_{2}c_{a_{1g}}(i\\omega)}}.\\ ] ] here the functions @xmath398 are defined as @xmath399 and @xmath400    examing the structure of the denominator of eqs .",
    "( c26)-(c31 ) , we see that the massless gauge mode ( goldstone mode ) in the @xmath178 channel drops out of the raman response , and only provides screening via eq .",
    "the massive modes do appear in the @xmath180 and @xmath181 channels while the massive mode found in the @xmath216 channel does not couple to a raman probe .",
    "linearizing the denominator around the position of the collective mode we calculate the residue @xmath401 of the mode to be @xmath402 and @xmath403 , where @xmath404 is the position of the collective mode in each channel . therefore , putting all our results together for the collective modes , we can argue that the collective modes are of little relevance to electronic raman scattering due to the fact that 1)the modes only exist at beyond a large strong couplings threshold , 2 ) the residue of the modes decreases the lower the position of the collective mode , and 3 ) that the broadening of the collective modes are substantial .",
    "however , of course the final  state interactions themselves can affect the spectrum @xcite .",
    "therefore we display our results in figs .",
    "( 8a - c ) for the entire spectrum in the @xmath265 and @xmath178 channels for different ratios of the parameter @xmath381 , where @xmath405 is the pairing interaction of @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "the response for the @xmath181 channels are similar to the @xmath216 case .",
    "we note that the interactions have only a minor affect on the spectra in the @xmath180 channel , only changing the cusp behavior near @xmath261 , ( this demonstrates how the finite @xmath179dispersion cuts off the logarithmic singularity in fig . 1 for the 2d fermi surface ) , while leaving the peak position and low frequency behavior unchanged .",
    "the interactions have more an effect in the @xmath216 and @xmath178 channels due to the fact that the peak of the spectra are very broad",
    ". therefore the interactions shift the peak position upwards in frequency along the top of the broad hump of the spectrum , from @xmath406 to @xmath407 for the @xmath216 channel , and from @xmath408 to @xmath409 in the @xmath178 channel .",
    "again we note that the low frequency behavior remains unchanged .",
    "a similar effect is seen in the @xmath181 channels . in particular , the massive mode in this channel is entirely damped leading to no drastic changes in the spectrum .",
    "we close this appendix by addressing the collective modes for a superconductor with a cylindrical ( 2d ) fermi surface . in a 2d system",
    "the only interactions that appear at the @xmath165 level are the @xmath180 and @xmath216 channels , while the @xmath178 and @xmath410 channels appear at @xmath411 . similarly , there are no @xmath181 channels for a system without dispersion in the @xmath179direction . therefore ,",
    "if we are only concerned with @xmath10wave interactions and not those of higher angular momentum channels , then we can set the matrix elements @xmath412 in eqs .",
    "( c21-c23 ) and the equations simplify greatly .",
    "since then there will be no channel mixing of the @xmath178 channels into the response , then therefore there can be no collective mode since no term appears in the denominators which has the form @xmath413 which arises through the function @xmath414 ( see eqs .",
    "( c21-c23 ) ) .",
    "therefore we can conclude that collective modes can only appear when the interactions are included in higher order @xmath30 channels for a 2d system .",
    "furthermore , the vertex corrections produce minor changes in the spectra only for the @xmath180 and @xmath216 channels .",
    "the changes are similar to the changes shown for the response functions evaluated on a spherical fermi surface ( apart from cutting off the logarithmic divergence of the @xmath180 response at the gap edge ) , and thus are not of major importance .",
    "we can therefore neglect the collective modes entirely and the effect of vertex corrections and simply use the bare bubble for the raman response .",
    "this completes the purpose of the appendix .",

    "<S> a gauge invariant theory for electronic raman scattering for superconductors with anisotropic pairing symmetry is analyzed in detail . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that raman scattering in anisotropic superconductors provides a wealth of polarization - dependent information which probes the detailed angular dependence of the superconducting ground state order parameter . </S>",
    "<S> the raman spectra shows a unique polarization dependence for various anisotropic pair  state symmetries which affects the peak position of the spectra and generates symmetry dependent low frequency and temperature power  laws which can be used to uniquely identify the magnitude and symmetry of the energy gap . </S>",
