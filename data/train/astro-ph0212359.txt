    ", we therefore must understand the environment within a molecular cloud .",
    "observations show that molecular clouds are composed of a hierarchical network of filaments , clumps and cores ( @xcite ) .",
    "the most popular explanation for this substructure is that of turbulent fragmentation ( @xcite ) . in this scenario ,",
    "turbulent fluctuations within the molecular cloud can compress the gas through shocks to high enough densities that the self - gravity of such regions becomes strong enough to induce collapse , resulting in a cloud which has been broken up into several condensing cores .",
    "the cores , due to their origins as fragmenting shocks , are arranged along filamentary structures ; the intersections of these filaments have many of these smaller cores attracted to their higher average density , resulting in clusters which resemble the observed clumps .",
    "we performed simulations to test whether the structure of cores produced in this turbulent fragmentation scenario are consistent with observation .",
    "our simulations were performed using the ncsa zeus - mp hydrodynamics code .",
    "zeus - mp is a mesh - based eulerian hydromagnetic code capable of performing 3d simulations .",
    "the self - gravity of the fluid is calculated using a fft gravity solver .",
    "our simulations are stopped when the numerical gravitational instability criterion of @xcite is violated ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "we use an isothermal equation of state and periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we start with a uniform initial density and no magnetic field , at a resolution of @xmath1 grid cells . into this box",
    "we inject an initial series of plane waves , with their amplitudes described by a kolmogorov scaling law ( @xmath2 ) and with random phases and directions .",
    "we ensure that @xmath3 .",
    "our simulations can be described by two parameters , the rms mach number used to normalize the velocity fluctuations , and the initial number of jeans masses on the grid , used to normalize the density .",
    "we chose our initial number of jeans masses from the clump data of @xcite",
    "we show the projected density of two of our simulations in figure [ fig - density ] , each of which is at the point where the @xcite condition is violated . in the simulation with an initial mass of @xmath4 ( where @xmath5 is the initial jeans mass ) ,",
    "the relatively weak gravitational force was not able to induce collapse until much of the turbulent kinetic energy had dissipated .",
    "the resulting core is much more homogeneous than might be expected for a turbulent process .",
    "the density structure of this core is slightly shallower than a bonnor - ebert sphere ( figure [ fig - profile ] ) , suggesting that some small amount of turbulent pressure is providing additional support to the fluid .",
    "the evolution is similar to that of @xcite and @xcite for a collapsing pre - protostellar object , prior to what they call `` core formation '' ( when a singularity forms ) .    for the run with a large number of initial jeans masses ( @xmath6 ) , significant turbulent motions are still present when the simulation is stopped .",
    "the fluid has condensed into a massive clump , surrounded by filamentary structures , and many smaller clump - like objects .",
    "the individual cores have a shallower density profile than those in the weak - gravity simulation , resembling that of a logatropic sphere ( @xmath7 ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "this suggests that they are still largely supported by turbulent motions .",
    "similar density structures have been seen in regions of high - mass star formation ( @xcite ) . in our simulations , the filaments and clumps",
    "appear to form simultaneously out of the collision and merger of short shock arcs , rather than undergoing hierarchical collapse .",
    "however , the shocks that do not merge do not contain enough mass to undergo gravitational collapse ."
