    "in the previous paper in this series  @xcite , we analyzed the results obtained from the `` glass badge '' individual dosimeters ( radio - photoluminescence ( rpl ) glass dosimeters : glass badge^^ ) used by residents of date city , fukushima prefecture , from 5 to 51 months after the fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant ( fdnpp ) accident , and concluded as follows :    * the individual doses obtained by individual dose monitoring with glass badges and the ambient doses at the residences of the glass - badge participants ( `` grid dose '' as defined in ref .",

    "* the obtained coefficient of 0.15 did not change with time , across the six airborne surveys conducted between november 2011 ( 4th survey ) and november 2014 ( 9th survey ) . * as a result , the conversion factor from the ambient dose rate to the personal dose , 0.6 , adopted by the ministry of the environment  @xcite , was found to be about four times larger than the coefficient 0.15 obtained by these actual measurements .    in particular , conclusion 2 )",
    "implies that the individual doses and the ambient doses decreased at the same rate .",
    "this further suggests that the lifetime doses of the residents who continue to live in the contaminated zones can be inferred from ambient doses obtained from the airborne monitoring surveys .    in this paper , the second in a series of three papers based on the date city glass badge data ,",
    "we first obtain a function @xmath1 for the temporal change of the ambient dose rate based on the airborne monitoring data .",
    "we then compare the time - integrated ambient - dose - rate curve @xmath2 to the additional cumulative doses measured from 5 to 51 months after the fdnpp accident .",
    "we further provide the estimates for the lifetime cumulative doses of the residents , by making use of @xmath3 .",
    "in addition , we examine the effect of decontamination on the individual doses of the residents , who continued to use glass badges and lived in the designated decontamination area throughout the study period .",
    "we then discuss the implications of our findings regarding the effectiveness of decontamination in the reduction of long - term cumulative doses .",

    "the averaged data within the 250 m grids have been disseminated as maps and numerical data  @xcite .",
    "the aerial survey was first conducted in april 2011 and the most recent was the tenth , conducted in november 2015 . in our previous paper  @xcite , we used data from the fourth through ninth airborne monitoring surveys , which overlapped in timing with the glass - badge measurements from sept . 2011",

    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1l ] .",
    "as shown , there is a good linearity between the ambient dose rates of @xmath7th and 4th surveys .",

    "the slope of each straight line represents the average reduction of the ambient dose rate relative to the 4th survey , which we plot with filled circles in fig .",
    "[ fig1r ] , versus years after the accident .",
    "next , the time dependence of the ambient dose rates was modeled by the following function , known from previous studies  @xcite , which contains the physical half - lives of cs-134 and cs-137 ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) , fast- and slow - ecological half - lives ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) and the fraction of the fast - ecological decay component ( @xmath15 ) , @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes that this function is normalized to the ambient dose rates of the 4th airborne survey conducted at @xmath18 . here",

    "date city started measuring individual doses with glass badges in august 2011 , when measurements were done for pregnant women and children aged 15 years and younger for one month . from september 2011",
    ", the measurement periods were extended to 3 months ( 1 quarter ) and measurements are still being continued at the time of writing ( table 1 of ref .",
    "the dosimeter supplier , chiyoda technol corporation , has been using the value of 0.54msvy@xmath6 as the contribution of the natural background radiation throughout fukushima prefecture since the fdnpp accident .",
    "this was measured in oarai in ibaraki prefecture , and is subtracted from the glass - badge readings when they report the additional external doses to the relevant municipalities  @xcite , including date city .    in the present paper , we selected the subjects who held the glass badges continuously from 2011q3 to 2015q1 ( from september 2011 to june 2015 ) , as this makes it possible to directly obtain their cumulative individual doses for the said period .",
    "the numbers of subjects thus selected were @xmath26 for zone a , @xmath27 for zone b and @xmath28 for zone c ( see sec.[zoning ] for the definition of the three zones ) .",
    "the additional cumulative external dose for the first 4 months after the accident , before the glass - badge measurement period , was assumed to be 1.4msv , which is the average value of the external dose estimated for the residents living in the northern fukushima prefecture region , as was published in the basic survey included in the fukushima health management survey  @xcite .",
    "the cumulative individual doses @xmath29 were then compared to the following function , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the ambient dose reduction function obtained in eq(1 ) , @xmath32 is for zone a , b and c. the mean ambient dose rates at the time of the 4th airborne monitoring were @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , @xmath36 is the conversion coefficient for zone @xmath32 ( see below ) , @xmath37 is the beginning of the glass - badge survey ( august 1 , 2011 ) , and @xmath38 is the estimated average external dose during the first 4 months of the accident ( see above ) .    the conversion coefficient @xmath0 , @xmath39 calculated in the previous paper , @xmath40  @xcite , was the average of all the glass - badge survey participants .",

    "date city pioneered the decontamination efforts , such as top soil removal , as described in the decontamination implementation plan ( 1st edition ) published in october 2011  @xcite . in the 2nd edition ,",
    "published in august 2012  @xcite , the city was divided into three zones , zone a ( @xmath46 ) , zone b ( between @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) , and zone c ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "zoning was set mainly for the purpose of determining the methods and priority of decontamination , and to carry out decontamination properly and promptly . according to the implementation plan , the residential premises and the surrounding forest up to 20 m from residential boundaries were to be decontaminated in zone a , residential premises were to be decontaminated in zone b , and `` hot spots '' were to be cleaned in zone c. the method for zone a is equivalent to the method described in the decontamination guidelines , published by the ministry of the environment  @xcite .",
    "the decontamination of residential premises based on the implementation plan in date city was completed in march 2014 .      since the decontamination methods adopted by date city differed for each zone , in order to correctly evaluate the effect of decontamination on individual doses it is necessary to select a single zone ( i.e. , common decontamination method ) , and to select the subjects who continuously held the glass badges while their houses were decontaminated .",
    "we focused on 1,700 houses where decontamination was done in zone a , among which all family members continuously held glass badges from 2011q3 to 2014q1 ( september 2011 to june 2014 ) , and decontamination was carried out during 2012q3 ( from october to december 2012 ) .",

    "the current study has a number of unique characteristics .",
    "first , no other cases of continuous population - scale mass monitoring of the individual external doses of residents living in long - term contaminated areas have been recorded , meaning that no comparable individual dose data is available .",
    "after the chernobyl accident , for example , external doses were generally estimated based on the ambient dose rates  @xcite , rather than on individual dose monitoring .",
    "therefore , the lifetime cumulative doses of residents , important information for those living in contaminated areas , were not derived from measured individual doses .",
    "the scale of the decontamination carried out in fukushima prefecture after the fdnpp accident is also unprecedented , meaning that comparable quantitative data regarding the effectiveness of decontamination in reducing individual doses on a population scale is unavailable . in japan after the fdnpp accident , the dose reduction due to decontamination has until now generally been evaluated by comparing the ambient dose rates before and after decontamination , measured using survey meters at various outdoor points on the premises .",
    "as such , evaluation of the effect of decontamination on the individual doses of the residents has until now not been implemented either retrospectively or prospectively .    fortunately , however , except for the initial 4 months after the fdnpp accident , individual doses have been continuously recorded in many municipalities in fukushima prefecture . in most cities , towns and villages , these individual measurements targeted limited groups of subjects and time periods .",
    "date city , which began measuring personal doses for schoolchildren and residents living in relatively high - dose areas from august 2011 and has continued to measure tens of thousands of citizens uninterruptedly , is an important exception .",
    "the availability of appropriate population - scale individual dose data , the scale of the decontamination that was performed in the areas where the subjects reside , and the availability of consistent aerial survey data from before and after the decontamination period , make the current study possible .",
    "we reported in the first installment of this series  @xcite that the correlation between the individual doses measured with glass badges in date city and the ambient dose rates derived from the airborne monitoring of residences did not change over time .",
    "based on that conclusion , in this report , we estimated the cumulative doses over a lifetime by extrapolating the individual doses of the date city residents who continuously held a glass badge , by making use of eq .",
    "( 2 ) . as a result",
    ", the median of the additional lifetime doses from external exposure pathways for residents continuing to live in zone a , the most contaminated area in date city ( and who received the highest doses in fukushima prefecture after the fdnpp accident ) , was estimated to be 18 msv .",
    "the icrp adopts an allowable dose band of 1 to 20 msv per year for individuals in existing exposure situations  @xcite .",
    "the present study indicates that the median additional lifetime ( i.e. , 70y ) dose by the fndpp accident of date city residents will not exceed 20 msv .    in the chernobyl accident , it was estimated that the residents in russia , belarus and ukraine received about a quarter of their total lifetime exposure ( up to 70 years after the accident ) during the first year following the accident  @xcite .",
    "similarly , the 1st - year external cumulative dose of date city residents was estimated to be @xmath60 of their total lifetime exposure .    in august 2011 ,",
    "the cabinet office of japan established a basic policy of decontamination , aiming at reducing the external dose rate received by the general public by 50% ( including physical decay and weathering effects ) in the two years from the end of august 2011 to the end of august 2013 .",
    "the report published in march 2015 by the ministry of the environment ( moe : responsible for decontamination )  @xcite , showed that the additional external dose rate as estimated from survey meter measurements decreased by approximately 62% in those two years in the area decontaminated according to the guidelines , to which the decontamination was said to contribute about 22% , and physical decay etc . contributed 40% . in date city ,",
    "the reduction of the grid dose ( airborne monitoring survey ) in the city between november 2011 and october 2013 was 60% , and the reduction of the individual dose ( glass badge ) in zone a during the same period was 62% , similar to the result shown in the moe report .",
    "it is possible , however , to explain the 60% reduction of the ambient dose rate in date city by decay and weathering alone .",
    "in addition , comparison between the individual- and ambient - dose rates in date city in the present study failed to confirm a 22% reduction of the individual doses due to decontamination , for the residents in zone a , where the decontamination was carried out according to the government guidelines .",
    "the authors believe that reasons why no decontamination effect could be seen in date city , unlike the results presented in the moe report , include :    1 .",
    "the ratio of the areas actually decontaminated to the area covered by the airborne monitoring is small .",
    "thus , decontamination has little effect in reducing the `` grid '' dose .",
    "2 .   the residents do not necessarily spend all their time only in the decontaminated residential areas , and 3 .",
    "the measurements included in the moe report were done at outdoor points on the premises , not reflecting the effect of decontamination on indoor dose rates .",
    "the information available for the present study , however , does not make it possible to evaluate the behavior patterns of individual residents or the retention status of each dosimeter , so it is difficult to further discuss the reasons why the effect of decontamination is not reflected in the individual doses .",
    "no comparable data is yet available to help determine whether or not this would be the case in other areas . but because residents of zone a in date city received some of the highest external doses to the public , and decontamination was performed relatively early there , meaning its effects would likely be most evident , the authors believe that their findings may possibly prove to be representative .",
    "in the present paper , we have shown that the ambient - dose - rate reduction function obtained from the airborne monitoring data can be applied uniformly to all zones in date city .",
    "regardless of the magnitude of the ambient dose rate , the difference in decontamination method , or whether or not decontamination was carried out , the reduction function was the same throughout date city . based on these results , the lifetime additional doses can be realistically estimated from the measured individual doses , extrapolated by means of the ambient - dose - rate reduction function . for establishing this method , which combines the individual dose and the ambient dose ,",
    "the existence of large - scale and long - term glass - badge data of date city was essential .",
    "although the proportionality coefficient @xmath61 may not be universal , the authors believe that the present method will make it possible in the future to reliably estimate the lifetime doses of residents living in contaminated areas based on regular airborne monitoring surveys , supplemented by smaller - scale individual dose monitoring surveys for the purpose of determining the ambient - dose - to - individual - dose coefficient @xmath0 .      99 miyazaki m and hayano r 2016 , individual external dose monitoring of all citizens of date city by passive dosimeter 5 to 51 months after the fukushima npp accident ( series ) : 1 .",
