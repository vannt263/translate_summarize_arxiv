    "recently , we have developped a simple field theory ( ft ) approach to describe liquids @xcite and more specifically electrolytes at interfaces .",
    "the use of density fields as basic elements of description rather than particle density distributions comes together with a radically different way of accounting for the statistical degrees of freedom of the system .",
    "it is the quantum mechanics which sets the correct combinatory of the states by telling us which two states can be distinguished in the phase space . in this paper , on a series of examples related to coulomb systems , we illustrate how within our approach the denombration of the states can help us interpret and give an original insight into a series phenomena related to coulomb systems . in the first part of the paper , we discuss general aspects and consequences of the formalism . in the second part",
    ", we illustrate the entropic role of the quantum mechanics in coulomb systems .",
    "the fundamental choice of our ft is to take directly the density of matter @xmath0 as the basic real valued field variable .",
    "as the densities fluctuate , we then fix the chemical potential @xmath1 and set the partition function to be the grand potential .",
    "it is then a functional integral according to @xmath2}]$ ] , where @xmath3 is the inverse temperature .",
    "the hamiltonian functional @xmath4 corresponds to a simple meaningful mean field approximation for the chemical potential @xmath5 which leads to @xmath6 = \\int \\rho(\\mathbf{r } )      \\left [ \\ln ( \\rho(\\mathbf{r})/ \\bar{\\rho}_z ) -1    \\right ]           d\\mathbf{r } + \\int \\rho(\\mathbf{r } ) \\rho(\\mathbf{r } ' )        v(|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}'|)\\,d \\mathbf{r } d\\mathbf{r } ' $ ] where @xmath7 is the activity . in @xcite , we have shown that provided a renormalization , this theory reproduces exactly the standard statistical mechanics .",
    "the peculiarity of the approach lies in the first term which is entropic and accounts for the quantum mechanics denombration of states with _ i _ )  the elementary volume in the phase space @xmath8 and _ ii _ )  the principle of indiscernibility for particles both properties which are , for @xmath9 particles , traditionally given by the @xmath10 measure .",
    "_ dyson like relations or equations of movement . _ a direct consequence of the integral functional formalism , can be seen in the invariance of the functional integral with respect to a change of the dummy field variable , for any functional @xmath11 $ ] we have for the averages @xmath12/\\delta \\rho\\right > =      \\left < a[\\rho](\\delta \\beta h[\\rho]/\\delta \\rho)\\right>$ ]",
    ". starting from the partition function , the application of this relation gives a new expression of the chemical potential : @xmath13\\rangle +    \\beta \\int v(|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}'|)\\langle \\rho(\\mathbf{r } ' ) \\rangle d\\mathbf{r}'$ ] .",
    "this relation has been discussed in view of more standard expressions @xcite . where field theory shows a simple mean interaction potential term and where the average of the entropic logarithmic term includes more intricate correlations , in contrast , standard expressions emphasize the interaction potential , the logarithmic term being the trivial ideal system .",
    "this displacement in the way correlations are treated , naturally suggests new approximations .",
    "_ new perspectives on old exact relations .",
    "_ we have rederived in @xcite the exact density contact theorem and the virial theorem .",
    "we have pointed out that our approach provides yet another point of view on this relation emphasizing the role of the logarithmic functional in the demonstration .",
    "_ coulomb systems are peculiar mixtures : _ by this we mean that we have two species bound by the condition of electroneutrality . on the one hand",
    ", we have entropic properties related with densities of each of the two indiscernable species . on the other hand , in coulomb systems we like to focus on the difference of the densities , the charge .",
    "our point is to treat on the same footing the purely entropic properties and the one related to the potential as they appear at the same level in our hamiltonian . and",
    "to show that this will lead to strong correlations between the different properties .",
    "intuitively , when we change the charge , we also modify the relative number of the species therefore their purely entropic combinatorics contribution .",
    "we hereafter discuss simple _ point ions _ to focus on these entropic terms .    at a charged interface",
    "the mean field approximation gives the gouy - chapman theory .",
    "discussing fluctuations beyond the mean field theory correspond to an expansion of the entropic part of the hamiltonian which for coulomb systems is @xmath14     + \\rho_-(\\mathbf{r})\\left[\\ln ( \\rho_-(\\mathbf{r})/\\bar{\\rho}_-)-1\\right]\\}$ ] with separate terms corresponding to each ion .",
    "but for the more natural variables for coulombic systems , the charge @xmath15 and the total density @xmath16 , the entropic functional mixes the fields as we have @xmath17 .",
    "note a peculiarity in ft is that linear combinations of the fluctuating fields @xmath18 , @xmath19 are natural and not simply combinations for the average quantities . in the expansion ,",
    "the quadratic part of the hamiltonian includes the coulomb potential interaction . with this quadratic term",
    ", we obtain the debye limiting law in the bulk .",
    "the specificity of the ft lies in the higher order terms which include products of @xmath18 and @xmath19 fields @xmath20 in local coupling terms .",
    "_ ionic depletion at a neutral interface__@xcite for a neutral interface and a symmetric electrolyte , there is intuitively no profile for the charge at a neutral interface .",
    "however , the loop expansion of the theory shows a profile of the quadratic fluctuations of the charge with a simple expression with the distance to the wall and a dependance on @xmath21 which characterizes the coulomb interaction strength where @xmath22 is the inverse debye length .",
    "physically , some fluctuations are frustrated at the vicinity of the interface due to the absence of ions in the other half space .",
    "the role of the entropic term is to imply that this coulombic effect is coupled to the total density field although this quantity is not directly related to coulomb interaction .",
    "the pertinence of this profile is further justified as it verifies the contact theorem which is not the case of the intuitive gouy - chapman or msa ( mean spherical approximation ) approaches .    _",
    "the anomalous capacitance behaviour . _ experimentally and in numerical simulations , we find systems where the electric capacitance decreases at low reduced temperature .",
    "this effect is non intuitive as one can expect the electric response of the system to decrease with increasing thermal agitation which is what the gouy - chapman and msa theories predict .",
    "this phenomenon appears at low reduced temperature when the coulomb interaction becomes stronger . within the field theory ,",
    "the phenomenon can easily be understood with the previously described depletion in the density profiles which naturally accounts for the decrease in the electric capacitance . for point ions",
    "@xcite , we have obtained a simple analytic expression of the capacitance .",
    "this has been corrected to account for the size of the ions @xcite .",
    "the comparison with the numerical simulations is rather good and the simplicity of the expressions and of the corrections indicate we capture the significant physical effect .",
    "entropic effects are also important for valence asymmetric systems , @xmath23 electrolytes where the electroneutrality condition has now modified the number balance of the ions .    _ anomalous capacitance for valence asymmetry .",
    "_ in @xcite , we have considered capacitance curves for different valencies , the curves are rather scattered but one finds that one should first redefine the temperature @xmath24 which is also a scaling with the ionic strength .",
    "however , the ionic strength @xmath25 scaling does not discriminate between a 2:2 and a 4:1 electrolyte .",
    "the ft introduces a distinct parameter @xmath26 which is really characteristic of the valence asymmetry . as in simulation results",
    ", ft predicts an increase of the differential capacitance peak with @xmath27 .",
    "this parameter appears naturally in ft as we can perform simple operations on the fluctuating fields and again it is related to the entropic term .",
    "_ potential of zero charge ( pzc ) for size and valence asymmetric systems .",
    "_ for the neutral interface , numerical simulations results show the existence of a spontaneous polarisation due to the asymmetry in size and/or in valence @xcite .",
    "the first is rather intuitive as the smaller ions by reaching nearer the interface induce a polarisation .",
    "less intuitive is the polarisation due to valence asymmetry . indeed , in figure 1 , standard approaches in liquids state physics @xcite do not account for such effect .    on the contrary",
    ", ft predicts the polarisation due to multivalency and we show results obtained by adding the msa theory for size asymmetry to the ft result for point ions ( size asymmetry being immaterial for point ions ) @xcite .",
    "the sign of the pzc is in agreement with the charge contact theorem @xcite and with the simulation results .",
    "the simplicity of the correction suggest again that we focus on the adequate physical effect .",
    "_ ionic criticality and valence asymmetry .",
    "_ we have derived in the ft an equation of state for ionic systems . in the loop expansion , the pressure is a series in terms of @xmath28 : @xmath29 .",
    "the linear term @xmath30 is the standard debye term , further we have a simple dependence with the @xmath31 parameter .",
    "we have generalized this expression to account for hard sphere effects by using the msa pressure the msa screening distance parameter , @xmath32 and calculated the asymmetry contribution @xmath33 using the msa correlation function .",
    "the term in the pressure associated with valence asymmetric systems gives a simple description of the decreasing critical temperature and increasing critical density in agreement with monte carlo ( mc ) results @xcite .",
    "respectively for the 1:1 , 2:1 , and 3:1 electrolytes the critical temperatures and densities are @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "this seems to indicate that the physics is likely to be associated with the simple number balance effect found in multivalent systems .",
    "within a ft framework , we have shown how the formalism can introduce a new point of view on coulomb systems .",
    "the basic and fundamental quantum mechanical counting of states can lead to important consequences in coulomb systems which have at least two indiscernable species .",
    "these entropic effects lead to a unavoidable correlation between charge and density fluctuations .",
    "this simple statement is sufficient to give meaningful interpretations , we believe this is useful to complete the standard liquid state approaches generally focused on excluded volume effects .",
