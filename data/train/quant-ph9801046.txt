    "an atom laser is a device which , in analogy to the optical laser , would emit a coherent beam of bosonic atoms .",
    "various models of atom lasers have been presented @xcite .",
    "many of these schemes are based around a master equation description for the dynamics of the system@xcite . in these",
    ", the atom laser output is described by a born - markov master equation . making the born - markov approximation involves assuming that reservoir correlations decay rapidly compared with the system damping time and that the reservoir does not change significantly with time due to the effect of the system .",
    "we discuss these approximations in the context of atom output coupling .",
    "born - markov master equations were initially derived for optical systems@xcite . there",
    "they are used to describe a system ( for instance an optical laser mode ) coupled to a large , unchanging reservoir ( the external modes ) . in optics",
    "the born - markov approximations allow an equation containing only system variables to be derived .",
    "one of the fundamental assumptions involved in deriving such a born - markov master equation is that the reservoir correlation functions decay rapidly .",
    "this allows the reservoir to be approximated as unchanging in time . while it is assumed the system does not affect the reservoir",
    ", the reservoir does affect the system .",
    "an equation in terms of system variables alone is also an important goal for describing atom lasers .",
    "however , atom and photon devices work in substantially different parameter regimes .",
    "moreover , atoms and photons have different dispersion relations , which affects the behaviour of the reservoir correlation functions .",
    "furthermore , typically the reservoir for an optical cavity is taken to be at thermal equilibrium at a nonzero temperature . for atoms ,",
    "a vacuum reservoir with all modes initially empty is often more appropriate .    in this paper",
    "we look at the validity of the born - markov master equation for describing output coupling from a single mode atomic system to a reservoir .",
    "the reservoir is described as a continuum of free - space modes .",
    "our description of the coupling will initially be quite general , though our later discussion will focus on particular schemes in which the atom becomes free of the system through a change of state .",
    "such a change of state to an untrapped state can be achieved using either a raman transition @xcite or an rf transition@xcite .",
    "we will also discuss the effects of gravity on output coupling . in the latter part of the paper we will focus on broadband coupling .",
    "this allows a comparison with exact results@xcite , however we also present finite coupling results which more accurately describe output coupling through a change of state .",
    "we will discuss exact equations which can be obtained in regimes where the born - markov approximations fail .",
    "in section [ sec : output ] we present our model of output coupling from a single mode trap .",
    "this allows exact equations of motion , and their solutions , to be obtained for system variables . in section [ sec : mastereqn ] we model this system using the master equation formalism , emphasising the importance of the born and markov approximations . in section",
    "[ sec : validity ] we then consider the validity of these approximations . in the optical case , the adequacy of the born - markov approximation means that the standard model we are using leads to exponential decay of the number of photons in a cavity .",
    "the equivalent model for atoms does not lead to an atom number which tends to zero for sufficiently long time . in section",
    "[ sec : nonzero ] we discuss the reasons for this and consider the results obtained from models which include the effects of gravity .",
    "having noted that the born - markov approximations may fail , we discuss in section [ sec : nonmarkov ] a non - markovian master equation and show that for atoms the born - approximation is not valid for our parameters even if we avoid making the markov approximation . in the regimes where these approximations fail , the output field becomes correlated with the system and hence can not be traced over to provide a master equation .",
    "finally we discuss ways of proceeding when the born - markov master equation fails .",
    "the most straightforward method is that used in section [ sec : output ] where exact equations for the whole system and reservoir are obtained .",
    "dilute gas bose einstein condensates ( bec ) are now available in the laboratory . to produce a continuously running atom laser from a bec",
    "requires the addition of a suitable pumping mechanism , and an output coupler .",
    "a change of atomic state through rf transition has been used to produce a `` pulsed atom laser''@xcite . the output coupling from a single mode to a large reservoir is sometimes described by a born - markov master equation of the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 describes the strength of the coupling and @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) is the annihilation ( creation ) operator for the single mode system .",
    "two important approximations involved in such a description are that the evolution is markovian and that it depends only on the system operators .",
    "the markovian property means that the rate of change of the state depends only on the state at that time .",
    "there is no explicit dependence on the state at previous times .",
    "the equation is a function of system variables only , due to tracing over the reservoir .",
    "this is appropriate if the reservoir remains uncorrelated with the system .",
    "in fact , it is approximated in deriving eq .",
    "( [ eq.quantumopticaleqn ] ) that the reservoir does not change with time .",
    "we wish to investigate these two approximations , and their validity for describing atomic output coupling . in a full atom laser model",
    "it is essential that a pumping term is also included .",
    "however , in this paper we consider a single mode coupled only through output coupling to the outside world .",
    "experimentally this corresponds to a leaky bec .",
    "we focus on the output coupling term which would be present in a full master equation model alongside other terms .",
    "we begin by considering a generic output coupling mechanism which we have previously analysed in the context of heisenberg equations of motion@xcite . here",
    "we investigate how such a model can be described by a density operator equation - in particular a master equation .",
    "when the output field is constrained by a waveguide such as in a hollow optical fibre model@xcite , the output field is effectively one dimensional .",
    "we consider a single mode system ( the lasing mode with creation operators @xmath3 ) coupled to a one - dimensional continuum of free space modes .",
    "the free space modes are labelled by their momentum , @xmath4 ( creation operators @xmath5 ) . in a general three dimensional model @xmath6",
    "would also be labelled by indicies describing the transverse modes . here , however , we suppress these indicies and assume that the output is coupled into a waveguide with the atoms remaining in a single transverse mode .",
    "the hamiltonian describing the system is given by @xmath7 the function @xmath8 describes the shape of the coupling in @xmath9 space , and is left general here . by appropriately choosing @xmath8 we may simulate a wide range of practical output coupling mechanisms , including position dependant coupling and the effect of momentum kicks .",
    "the latter may result from laser photons when an atom undergoes a change of state .",
    "choosing @xmath8 as constant over a broad region corresponds to broadband coupling .",
    "this model is used for optical input - output theory@xcite , and in proposed atom laser theories which result in born - markov master equations . for the atom case",
    "this model ignores potentially important effects such as gravity and atom - atom interactions . for",
    "now , we neglect these effects in order to investigate the validity of the born - markov approximations .",
    "we use this model to understand the differences between optical and atomic output coupling .",
    "we will extend the model in section [ sec : nonzero ] .",
    "we use the hamiltonian presented above to write heisenberg equations of motion for the operators @xmath2 , @xmath6 .",
    "we can also obtain equations for combinations of these operators which may be of more interest , such as the number of atoms in the system , @xmath10 .",
    "these equations can be difficult to solve in general .",
    "however , since they include the output and system explicitly , they describe the dynamics of the model exactly@xcite .",
    "exact solutions can be compared with born - markov master equations .    to facilitate this comparison we present exact equations for the expectation values of the system operators , @xmath3 and @xmath11 . in these",
    "we assume ( as we will do in the master equation descriptions to follow ) that the reservoir is initially empty , @xmath12 .",
    "we do not place any further restrictions on @xmath13 .",
    "this is the first fundamental difference between the atom and photon case .",
    "an empty reservoir for photons is inapropriate at finite temperatures@xcite . in experiments where a bose - einstein condensate is allowed to leak out of a trap , however , the most appropriate initial state for the outside atom modes is a vacuum .",
    "similarly , for an atom laser in a hollow fibre , which we discussed in @xcite , the initial output modes would be empty .",

    "the validity of the markov approximation depends on the interplay between the reservoir correlation timescale , the system timescale , and the timescale on which the system decays .",

    "@xmath22 , whereas for photons @xmath59 , where @xmath25 is the speed of light .",

    "a second timescale condition for the born - markov approximation which is discussed in some treatements @xcite of the optical born - markov approximation is that the system timescale , defined as @xmath60 must satisfy @xmath61 this is equivalent to requiring @xmath62 to be very large .",
    "a large @xmath62 condition is required in optics for a number of reasons .",
    "first , the initial coupling hamiltonian , of the form ( @xmath63 , is in the rotating wave approximation and ignores terms of the form @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "this rotating wave approximation in optics can only be made in the case of large @xmath62 .",

    "the terms which are eliminated in the optics case@xcite through the assumption of large @xmath62 are already zero for our model , due to the assumption of an atom vacuum reservoir .",
    "thus , one may be led from these treatments to suppose that the born - markov approximation is made independently of @xmath62 for an atom - vacuum reservoir .",
    "this however is not the case as we will discuss later .    in optics ,",
    "these timescale conditions are usually satisfied . for a coupling based on a mirror",

    "figure [ fig.1]b compares the exact and born - markov solutions to our model in the broadband limit . in this limit",
    "the timescale , @xmath54 as defined above tends to zero , thus the first inequality is satisfied .",
    "however , the inequality , eq .",
    "( [ eq.inequality ] ) , fails .",
    "this figure demonstrates that even for infinitely broad atom coupling the born - markov approximation may fail .",
    "the parameters chosen are the same as those for the gaussian coupling , with a strength of coupling in the exact solutions given by @xmath122 in this case the born - markov solution again gives exponential decay .",
    "however , the decay constant is now given as the broadband limit of eq .",
    "( [ eq.c ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig.1 ] demonstrates that for our model of output coupling from an atom laser , results for the number of atoms using the born - markov approximations disagree qualitatively with the exact solutions .",
    "one of the effects of not being able to ignore the back - action from the reservoir is that for the model we are considering the number of atoms in the cavity does not tend to zero for long times ( figure [ fig.1 ] ) .",
    "we discuss reasons for this behaviour in the next section .",
    "if effects such as gravity and repulsive interactions are included the cavity number will tend to zero .",
    "however , even with these effects included the loss is not exponential and the conclusion that the born - markov approximation fails to describe the output coupling remains .    here",
    ", we have demonstrated the failure of the born - markov approximation by the use of the particular system variable , @xmath123 .",
    "however , the problems with using the born - markov approximations are not confined to this particular example . for instance , if the output from a bec is described using a born - markov master equation , the resulting long time energy spectrum is lorentzian .",
    "however , if we avoid making the born - markov approximations for atoms the exact spectrum may be non - lorentzian for some values of coupling strength , @xmath28 , and frequency , @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "in this section we present a quasi - single particle model which allows us to consider the effects of gravity on our output coupling .",
    "such a model can not be extended to show interesting effects , such as noise suppression due to gain saturation if pumping is added to the model as it does not give information about the general quantum statistics of the output atom field .",
    "however , it shows that the inclusion of gravity causes the atom number to asymptote to zero .",
    "it does this in a non - exponential way , however , and therefore can not be modelled by a damping term based on the born - markov approximation .",
    "moreover , we demonstrate that the short time behaviour predicted by the models with gravity agree with the exact solutions we have presented earlier which ignore the effects of gravity .",
    "the previous section demonstrated qualitative differences between the exact solution of our model and the solution which uses the born - markov approximation .",
    "in fact , the exact solution of the model has a stable , nondispersing state which means that not all of the atoms leave the cavity , whereas the approximate solution shows an exponential decay of atoms from the cavity .",
    "the presence of the stable state is due to a coherence between the atoms in the cavity and the output modes .",
    "the born - markov approximation ignores any coherence between the cavity mode and the output modes , and therefore can not describe any model which produces such features .",
    "we now show that such features would be destroyed by gravity .    for coherent dynamics without atom - atom interactions , the multiparticle evolution is identical to the evolution of a single particle @xcite .",
    "the gravitational term makes it impossible to derive analytical results as in section  [ sec : output ] , so we solved the corresponding time - dependent schrdinger equation numerically .",
    "this was done in the position basis rather than the momentum basis for convenience .",
    "the hamiltonian for our system with the inclusion of a gravitational potential is @xmath124 where the coupling function , @xmath125 is related to @xmath8 by a fourier transform , @xmath126    @xmath127 is the momentum operator . with the term @xmath128 , this model is equivalent to a single particle version of our earlier many particle description , eq .",
    "( [ eq.heff ] ) , and produces a time dependance for the probability of finding an atom in the cavity which is identical to @xmath129 , found previously .",
    "these show a long time steady state in the number of atoms in the cavity which does not tend towards zero . with the inclusion of gravity ( @xmath130 )",
    ", however , the number of atoms decays to zero in a non - exponential manner .",
    "this behaviour is shown in figure [ fig.2 ] .",
    "=    in figure [ fig.2 ] we can see collapses and revivals in the number of atoms in the cavity .",
    "this is due to the evolving phase relationship between the atoms in the cavity and the atoms which have been coupled into the output field modes .",
    "there is no version of the born - markov approximation that can describe behaviour such as this , as such an approximation requires that there be no entanglement between the lasing mode and the output modes .",
    "the presence of gravity changes the long time behaviour of our model so that the number of atoms asymptotes to zero , while the short time behaviour remains the same .",
    "other effects may also lead to the long time decay of atom number .",
    "repulsive interactions , for instance , would be expected to destroy the thin stable structure in position space which leads to the long time non - zero population of the cavity mode .",
    "the effect of repulsive interactions can be included in this model by including in eq .",
    "( [ eq.h2 ] ) a nonlinear hamiltonian term given by @xmath131 including such interactions into our model produces a gross - pitaevskii type equation @xcite , where @xmath132 is the number of atoms in the system and @xmath133 an interaction strength .",
    "we find that introducing such an interaction term does cause the atom number to go below the nonzero steady state predicted in the interaction free model .",
    "in the previous two sections we have shown that the standard master equation does not correctly describe the dynamics of our model for particular parameters .",
    "however a master equation , in terms of only the system variables , would be an important tool for describing an atom laser .",
    "we now consider whether a non - markovian master equation can give a correct description of the atom laser . to do this",
    ", we continue to make the born approximation , but do not make a markov approximation .",
    "the master equation with the born approximation only is given in eq .",
    "( [ eq.born ] ) .",
    "again , we check the validity of the born approximation by comparing the results obtained from this born master equation with the exact solutions .",
    "we begin by considering the resulting equation for the expectation value @xmath134 , @xmath135 eq .",
    "( [ eq.dadagdtnm ] ) is the same as that obtained through the full system plus reservoir equations given in eq .",
    "( [ eq.adag ] ) . this can be seen by making the transformation @xmath136 in eq .",
    "( [ eq.dadagdtnm ] ) to obtain the alternative form , eq .",
    "( [ eq.adag ] ) . despite this success , the density operator equation with the born approximation , eq .",
    "( [ eq.born ] ) is not correct . in particular",
    ", the born approximation does not give correct values for higher order expectation values , such as @xmath94 .    the equation derived from the non - markovian master equation , eq .",
    "( [ eq.born ] ) for the number operator expectation value is @xmath137 with solution @xmath138 these do not agree with the corresponding exact equations given in eq .",
    "( [ eq.adaga ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq.adagasoln ] ) , as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.3 ] .",
    "=    this figure compares the exact results for @xmath139 with the solution in the born approximation only , eq .",
    "( [ eq.adagasolnnm ] ) .",
    "the parameter values chosen are the same as those discussed in section [ sec : equations ] and the comparison is made for broadband coupling .",
    "the reason for the failure of the non - markovian master equation is that where the correct equations lead to the term @xmath140 , the non - markovian master equation with the born approximation leads to @xmath141 .",
    "these two terms are equal if we consider only the free evolution of the system , and ignore the interaction term . that is , to zeroth order in @xmath142 , @xmath143 . however , there are interaction terms between the system and reservoir . due to the interaction ,",
    "terms obtained using the born approximation are not equal to the exact results . to reproduce equations for the correct system dynamics",
    "we can not ignore the correlations which arise between the system and reservoir .    in optics",
    "the born - markov approximation is a useful approximation in almost all practical parameter regimes .",
    "in fact , in optics the value of @xmath62 is sufficiently large that , if one assumes a linear dispersion relation the reservoir correlation can be well approximatied by a dirac delta function .",
    "this is not the case for atoms .",
    "the non - markovian master equation , eq . ( [ eq.born ] ) , gives correct results for single operator expectation values .",
    "nevertheless , the born approximation neglects higher orders in the interaction term , @xmath142 , thus ignoring reservoir evolution .",
    "this leads to incorrect results for higher order expectation values , such as @xmath129 .",
    "we have discussed the use of master equations and other density operator equations for atom lasers .",
    "we find that the born - markov master equation , as is commonly used in optics , is not valid in parameter regimes in which atom lasers may work .",
    "the output modes correlation function for photons is well approximated by a delta function in the broadband limit , and for typical optical parameters . in comparison",
    ", this function falls off as @xmath84 for atoms because of the atom dispersion relations .",
    "the born - markov approximations must be made self consistently . in regimes where the born - markov approximations fail",
    ", the system can be solved in the heisenberg picture , treating the output modes fully @xcite .",
    "for broadband coupling , the parameter regimes in which the born - markov approximation is valid is given in eq .",
    "( [ eq.inequality ] ) .",
    "another possibility for describing such systems involves the use of quantum trajectories .",
    "these have been found to be useful for other systems in which no born - markov master equation exists@xcite .",
    "the breakdown of the born and markov approximations means that new theoretical methods will be required to understand the atom laser in some regimes .",
    "however , it also opens up the possibility of finding new properties of atom lasers significantly different from those found in the optical laser .",
