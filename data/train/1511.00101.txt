    "over the past decade , our ability to make high precision measurements of the cosmic microwave background and distance measurements of type ia supernovae have led to the remarkable conclusion that the expansion rate of the universe is accelerating .",
    "the most widely accepted cosmological model of the universe , based on general relativity  _ the concordance model _",
    " attributes this acceleration to a mysterious , exotic form of energy density called _ dark energy _ , which dominates the energy density of the universe at the present time .",
    "while this model is by far the simplest and most successful , in terms of fitting the current cosmological data , there are a number of shortcomings associated with this theory , such as fine tuning issues , the coincidence problem and the need for unknown , exotic forms of energy .",
    "naturally , such fundamental problems begs the question of whether or not our understanding of physics is complete on the scales which we are applying it ; for example , could the late time acceleration of the universe be a manifestation of the break down of the gravitational interaction on cosmological scales ?",
    "it is for this reason that viable alternative theories of gravitation are currently receiving a great deal of attention .",
    "a very popular class of alternatives to the @xmath1cdm model involve modifying , the einstein - hilbert action by considering terms containing higher order curvature invariants .",
    "this results in a gravitational theory which produces predictions that differ from general relativity _ only _ late in the matter dominated era of the universe , producing an effective dark energy term which leads to the observed late time acceleration , as well as retaining the success of general relativty on solar system scales .",
    "these @xmath3 theories of gravity , by their construction , introduce an additional scalar degree of freedom which has a coupling to matter that is extremely weak @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "this scalar degree of freedom results in a long range fifth force which predicts that the curvature of the space time in the neighbourhood of a localised energy density is uncoupled from the energy density .",
    "taking this effect into consideration , several conditions must be satisfied in order for a @xmath3 theory to be compatible in both the low and high curvature regimes @xcite .",
    "it is important that the expansion history in the early universe matches what is obtained from general relativity , in order to be consistent with big bang nucleosynthesis , as well as the fact that the @xmath3 theory should generate a late time acceleration compatible with current observations , without the introduction of a cosmological constant .",
    "if we take the function @xmath3 to be made up of the usual linear lagrangian plus some corrective terms encapsulated in a second function @xmath4 : @xmath5 , then the above conditions can be expressed as the following limits on @xmath4 : @xmath6 .",
    "the first limit corresponds to epochs during which the model @xmath3 should resemble a late time @xmath1cdm universe , containing an effective cosmological constant , for which the lagrangian looks like @xmath7 .",
    "the second limit enforces the condition that the @xmath3 model chosen must behave close to standard gr .",
    "so far , the most compelling models proposed , which satisfy these limits are broken power law functions , due to the fact that such functions can be parametrised to give the required behaviour in the relevant regimes .",
    "several models have been proposed which are designed to satisfy the above limits @xcite and we will focus on the first of these , introduced originally by hu & sawicki @xcite .    the main difficulty which plagues the investigation of such models results from the inherent complexity associated with the inclusion of higher order invariants of the curvature tensor into the gravitational action .",
    "it is consequently extremely difficult if not impossible to derive the cosmological dynamics and obtain exact solutions for such theories .",
    "one method , which has been found to be particularly effective in overcoming many of the issues encountered with higher order theories , is the so - called dynamical systems approach to cosmology @xcite .",
    "this technique relies on the ability to express the cosmological equations as a set of autonomous differential equations , using a set of suitably chosen variables . in this paper",
    "we use these techniques to proved a detailed description of the cosmological dynamics of the hu & sawicki model and determine under what conditions a @xmath1cdm - like expansion history can be obtained .    in section [ sect - f(r ) ]",
    "below we briefly present the field equations for @xmath3 gravity in a metric formalism .",
    "section [ sect - hs ] discusses the hu - sawicki model , which is the focus of analyses performed below .",
    "we present the dynamical systems approach to @xmath3 gravity , give the general form of the dynamical system for a general @xmath3 and carefully detail the analysis and its results in section [ sect - ds ] , where we discuss the fixed points , and their stability , both in a compact and non - compact phase space .",
    "the expansion history for the particular hu - sawicki model , considered in this paper is calculated in section [ sectexphist ] to provide a comparison with the concordance model , as well as to illustrate the effects of fixing the initial conditions on the viability of the model .",
    "finally , we review the results presented and discuss conclusions and various limitations of the analysis in section [ sect - conc ] . throughout this paper natural units",
    "are assumed ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "in principle there is no a - priory reason to restrict the gravitational lagrangian . in fact",
    ", it is quite possible that the addition of higher powers of @xmath9 and corresponding invariants may improve the characterisation of gravitational fields near regions where @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "further impetus to explore results of nonlinear gravitational lagrangians is due to the fact that every theory attempting to unify the fundamental interactions require either that there are non minimal couplings to the geometry or that higher order curvature invariants appear in the action @xcite,@xcite .    in higher order gravity theories ,",
    "the einstein - hilbert action is modified by considering the addition of higher order , most commonly , _",
    "second order _ , curvature invariants .",
    "second order modifications result in quadratic lagrangians , which involve some of the four possible curvature invariants of the ricci scalar , ricci and riemann tensors ; @xmath11 and @xmath12 , here @xmath13 is the completely antisymmetric tensor , of rank four .",
    "in fact , by making use of the following identities , which are true for all 4-dimensional space times : @xmath14 as well as the fact that the following identity is true for spacetimes with maximally symmetric spatial sections ,    @xmath15    it is possible to deduce that any quadratic modifications to the lagrangian can in general be represented by combinations of powers of the ricci scalar .",
    "the modified lagrangian is then given by : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the standard matter lagrangian .",
    "clearly general relativity is recovered when @xmath18 .",
    "varying ( [ modlagrangian ] ) , with respect to the metric we obtain the following fourth order field equations : @xmath19 here primes denote derivatives with respect to the ricci scalar .",
    "we are only concerned with modifications to gr at late times , so @xmath20 is described completely by the matter dominated stress - energy tensor . for the spatially flat ( @xmath21 ) flrw metric with signature @xmath22 , where the matter is described as a perfect fluid with equation of state @xmath23 , the independent field equations in terms of the function @xmath3 are ( dots represent temporal derivatives ) : + _ the raychaudhury equation _",
    "@xmath24 where @xmath25 represents the usual expansion rate , @xmath26 , + _ the friedmann equation _ ,    @xmath27    _ the trace equation _    @xmath28    in addition",
    "the _ energy conservation equation _ for standard matter is given by @xmath29 finally an expression for the ricci scalar in terms of @xmath25 can be obtained by combining the raychaudhuri and the friedmann equations : @xmath30",
    "the hu - sawicki model ( hs model ) for @xmath3-gravity @xcite was designed specifically to overcome several problems faced by other @xmath3 functions considered as alternatives to the lagrangian of general relativity .",
    "it is constructed in such a way that it satisfies the limits mentioned in the previous section , and therefore , given an appropriate choice of parameters , is able to recover standard general relativity at high redshifts , as well as mimic @xmath1cdm at low redshifts .",
    "see @xcite for details on this class of models . below is a short summary of the parameters which enter this theory .",
    "the functional form of @xmath3 is characterised by the correction @xmath4 , which is a general class of broken power laws : @xmath31 here @xmath32 and the mass scale @xmath33 is taken to be : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the average density of the present epoch and @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath37 and @xmath38 are dimensionless parameters , whose relationship will be shown to be associated with the present matter density parameter , @xmath39 .",
    "the sign of the second derivative of the correction , @xmath4 , is required to be strictly positive for high curvatures relative to density in order to guarantee that at high density , the solution is stable in this regime .",
    "@xmath40 the above condition is important to ensure that at high redshifts , the general relativity values of quantities , such as @xmath41 are recovered . for convenience",
    "we define @xmath42 .",
    "the key appeal of this class of models is that , explicitly , there is no cosmological constant term .",
    "however , if we consider the limit of very high curvature relative to @xmath33 : @xmath43 it can be seen that , for a fixed value of @xmath44 , the limiting case of @xmath45 behaves like a cosmological constant for both local and cosmological scales . at finite values of @xmath46 ,",
    "the curvature is frozen to a fixed value and no longer decreases with matter density ; this gives rise to a set of models which exhibit late time acceleration similar to @xmath1cdm @xcite .",
    "it follows that @xcite admits the following relationship between the parameters and the energy densities of the cosmological constant , @xmath47 , and matter , @xmath48 : @xmath49 the remaining two parameters @xmath50 and @xmath46 are free to choose in order to determine the expansion history and how well it fits observations , compared to the @xmath1cdm model .",
    "larger values of @xmath50 allows the model to mimic @xmath1cdm until later in the expansion history , while smaller values of @xmath51 leads to a reduction in general deviations from it . because both the hubble parameter and the critical density depend on the correction @xmath52",
    ", @xmath48 only becomes the actual value of the matter density in the following limit : @xmath53 the matter density in the physical units , however , remains unchanged .",
    "considering the @xmath1cdm model with flat spatial geometry , we have : @xmath54 and for the derivative of the correction : @xmath55 the values for today are : @xmath56 for @xmath57 .",
    "@xcite uses the following specific values : @xmath58 therefore we have : @xmath59 figure 9 in @xcite show the range and combinations of parameter values , @xmath60 and @xmath50 , which are acceptable and enable the model to satisfy solar system tests .",
    "we follow the general strategy for applications of the dynamical systems approach to the cosmology of fourth order gravity , developed in @xcite .",
    "this provides a way of analysing the dynamics of any analytic function @xmath3 which is invertible for the ricci scalar . following the approach of @xcite , a compact analysis of the phase space for a general @xmath3 theory",
    "is performed , by defining a strictly positive normalisation to pull any solutions at infinity into a finite volume .",
    "[ phase2 ] .",
    "this plot demonstrates the anti - symmetry between the expanding and contracting regions of the phase space , defined by the @xmath61 plane , as well as the possibility that orbits can cross this plane  implying the existence of universe models with bounce behaviour . *",

    "ensuring that this time variable is strictly non - decreasing amounts to guaranteeing that the expansion - normalisation adopted is strictly positive .",
    "thus , the sign of time is maintained , whether studying expanding or collapsing cosmologies .",
    "this means that any negative contribution to the friedmann equation must be absorbed into the normalisation . in the case where a quantity can be both positive and negative , each option",
    "must be studied in a separate sector of the phase space .",
    "the full phase space can then be reconstructed by simply aligning the various sectors along their common boundaries . a phase space which is constructed in this way",
    "can therefore include all static , bouncing and re - collapsing models .",
    "in this paper we will only consider sectors of the phase space where @xmath63 , simply because negative ricci scalar values are not of any real physical interest .",
    "we require @xmath64 , and the matter density is assumed to be non - negative .",
    "the function @xmath65 under consideration here , is always positive .",
    "therefore , in ( [ modfried2 ] ) , the term which contains @xmath65 attached to a negative sign must be absorbed into the positive - definite normalisation .",
    "rewriting the modified friedmann equation ( [ modfried2 ] ) in the following way allows a convenient definition of the normalised variables : @xmath66 the left hand side of the above equation is a positive definite quantity . quite naturally , assigning each term in ( [ friedrewrite ] ) a name , we obtain the following dynamical variables : @xmath67 where @xmath68 represents the normalisation which compactifies the phase space , and takes the form @xmath69 the normalised time variable is then defined as follows : @xmath70 thus , ( [ friedrewrite ] ) and ( [ defd ] ) establish two independent constraint equations for our system : @xmath71 the dynamical variables defined by ( [ variables ] ) constitute the coordinates of our compact phase space and the boundaries of this phase space are defined by the above two constraints as follows : @xmath72 the construction of @xmath68 ensures that the dynamical variables are well defined when @xmath73 , thus we expect all static , expanding , collapsing and bounce solutions to be included . expanding and collapsing universes are connected across the @xmath61 boundary .",
    "differentiating the dynamical variables ( [ variables ] ) with respect to @xmath74 and substituting the independent cosmological equations , ( [ modfried2])@xmath75([modtrace2 ] ) , leads to a set of 5 first order autonomous differential equations .",

    "while these equations are completely general for any @xmath3 theory of gravity , the choice of theory is fixed by expressing the term @xmath79 ( which appears in the equations ) in terms of the set of dynamical variables , thus closing the system of equations . in the case of the hs model ,",
    "this can only be done for the particular choice of model parameters : @xmath90 and @xmath37 . while this may appear somewhat restrictive , it is easy to show using other numerical experiments , that this choice does not lead to a loss of generality .",
    "indeed , choosing @xmath221 , simply leads to an improved fit to the standard @xmath1cdm expansion history @xcite .",
    "a compact dynamical systems analysis was performed using a positive definite normalisation , which brings any equilibrium points at infinity to the boundary of the region defined by the range of the dynamical systems variables . from this analysis ,",

    ", a finite dynamical systems analysis was performed to confirm that the non - boundary points obtained in the compact analysis were , in fact , finite points .",
    "the finite points obtained in this analysis are the analogies of the de sitter and  radiation like \" points , @xmath225 and @xmath226    it was found that for @xmath90 , the expansion history generated from the initial values and parameter values specified in @xcite for the _ present epoch _ resulted in a universe which is dominated until very low redshifts by an equation of state parameter equal to @xmath2 , implying that fixing the initial conditions to be exactly those of the @xmath1cdm conditions today leads to an expansion history very different from @xmath1cdm and high redshifts ( @xmath227 ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that for @xmath90 , the slope of the correction @xmath4 defined by the hs model does not allow for the initial value of @xmath4 to sit on the constant valued plateau of the function .",
    "it is this plateau which mimics the late time cosmological constant behaviour of the model .",
    "we showed that by setting initial conditions to be the same as @xmath1cdm model at high redshift , leads to a value of @xmath4 which is equal to its  plateau \" value and consequently leads to an expansion history which is much closer to the @xmath1cdm model .",
    "moreover it produces a dimensionless hubble parameter that is nearly indistinguishable from @xmath1cdm , with deviations only appearing in the dynamics of the deceleration parameter .",
    "most importantly , it gives an equation of state parameter which behaves like cdm for most of the expansion history , and begins to tend toward -1 to indicate the domination of an effective cosmological constant term , at low redshifts .",
    "unfortunately for values of @xmath50 different from @xmath228 , the dynamical systems formalism presented here does not lead to a set of autonomous equations which can be analysed in the same way .",
