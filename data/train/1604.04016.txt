    "the dos was calculated by employing the lattice parameters obtained from the xrd data .",
    "the atomic coordinates were those of prcd@xmath0p@xmath0@xcite.we note here that the atomic coordinates of lacd@xmath0p@xmath0 obtained from a preliminary rietveld analysis are almost identical to those of prcd@xmath0p@xmath0 .",
    "@xmath18 was estimated to be 0.75 ev , which agrees well with the experimentally determined value from the @xmath9 spectrum .",
    "the valence and conduction bands are primarily composed of orbitals with covalent bond characteristics between the cd and p atoms and the la 5@xmath30 orbital , respectively .    (",
    "t ) of cecd@xmath0p@xmath0 and lacd@xmath0p@xmath0.,width=340 ]    the temperature dependence of electrical resistivity @xmath10(t ) of cecd@xmath0p@xmath0 and the la counterpart show semiconducting behaviors , and the arrhenius plots of @xmath10(t ) are presented in fig .",
    "the activation energy @xmath31 was estimated on the high - temperature side using the relation @xmath32 ( see the lines in fig .",
    "@xmath31 was determined to be about 81 mev ( 140 mev ) for cecd@xmath0p@xmath0 ( lacd@xmath0p@xmath0 ) , which is smaller than the fundamental band gap @xmath18 .",
    "the difference is presumably due to the existence of impurity states in the fundamental band gap .",
    "the semiconducting scal@xmath0c@xmath0-type ce - compounds represented by cezn@xmath0p@xmath0 are superior platforms for photoinduced kondo effect@xcite , which would require a band gap closing under illumination .",
    "thus , lower @xmath10 with a smaller @xmath18 would be advantageous for the observation of photoinduced kondo effect .",
    "however @xmath18 ( @xmath33 0.75 ev ) of cecd@xmath0p@xmath0 is larger than that ( @xmath33 0.4 ev@xcite ) of cezn@xmath0p@xmath0 and consequently @xmath10(t ) of cecd@xmath0p@xmath0 tends to be higher . therefore we speculate that cecd@xmath0p@xmath0 is not a good candidate showing the photoinduced kondo effect .",
    "the inset shows the low - temperature @xmath11 of the sample.,width=415 ]    figure 7 shows the temperature dependence of the reciprocal @xmath11 of cecd@xmath0p@xmath0 .",
    "it follows the curie - weiss law above 50 k ( see the line in fig .  7 ) . the effective moment @xmath34 and weiss temperature @xmath35 are 2.77 @xmath36/ce and -60 k , respectively .",
    "the value of @xmath34 is near to 2.54 @xmath36/ce , expected for a free trivalent ce ion .",
    "the fact is consistent with the lanthanide contraction as shown in fig .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "7 is @xmath11(t ) below 2 k , which exhibits no magnetic ordering down to 0.48 k. the faint kink at approximately 1.5 k may be due to the existence of magnetic impurity phase .",
    "we need further purification of the sample .",
    "the replacement of zn atom with cd one leads to the expansion of lattice parameters ( @xmath15=4.28251(62 )  , @xmath6=21.00239(230 )  for cecd@xmath0p@xmath0 and @xmath15=4.051  , @xmath6=20.019  for cezn@xmath0p@xmath0@xcite ) .",
    "therefore , as expected in the introduction , magnetic ordering temperature of 0.75 k in cezn@xmath0p@xmath0 is possibly reduced below 0.48 k in cecd@xmath0p@xmath0 . taking into account that several @xmath1-electron compounds with the scal@xmath0c@xmath0-type structure are quantum spin systems@xcite",
    ", we may propose that cecd@xmath0p@xmath0 is a candidate of quantum spin liquid .",
    "further experiments at lower temperature are necessary to confirm the proposal .",
    "the rather large negative @xmath35-value may be the signature of quantum spin frustration@xcite .",
    "however in rare - earth compounds , the cef effect plays a major role for determining @xmath35-value .",
    "no observation of broad maximum in @xmath11(t ) means that a dimerization of 4@xmath1 spins like in metallic ceal@xmath0c@xmath0 does not occur , which might be common characteristic in semiconducting scal@xmath0c@xmath0-type ce - compounds .",
    "p@xmath0 measured at 0.48 k.,width=340 ]    as shown in fig .  8 , the magnetization @xmath37 at 0.48 k shows a paramagnetic behavior up to 1 t , which supports the extrinsic nature of kink of @xmath11(t ) at approximately 1.5 k. the point symmetry of ce site is trigonal @xmath38 .",
    "the cef hamiltonian@xcite can be expressed as follows : @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the cef parameters and stevens operator equivalents , respectively . under the trigonal cef ,",
    "the 6-fold degeneracy of the @xmath42 = 5/2 multiplet of ce@xmath2 ions splits into three doublets : @xmath43",
    "the @xmath37 value calculated for the isolated @xmath44 ground state far exceeds 0.225 @xmath36/ce at 1 t. the mixed states between @xmath45 and @xmath46 can reduce the @xmath37-value",
    ". therefore @xmath47 or @xmath48 state would be the cef ground state .    here",
    "we note that the point symmetry @xmath38 of ce site in cecd@xmath0p@xmath0 is the same as that in ce@xmath3sn@xmath3o@xmath4 which is reported to be the candidate of quantum spin liquid .",
    "the inverse of @xmath11(t ) of ce@xmath3sn@xmath3o@xmath4 follows a curie - weiss law explained by free trivalent ce ions with large negative @xmath35 of -220 k@xcite .",
    "the magnetization curve@xcite of ce@xmath3sn@xmath3o@xmath4 shows a paramagnetic behavior and @xmath37 ( @xmath49=1 t ) at 0.5 k reaches a value similar to that of cecd@xmath0p@xmath0 .",
    "the cef ground state of ce@xmath3sn@xmath3o@xmath4 is also a linear combination of @xmath45 and @xmath46 states .",
    "the similar cef ground states under the @xmath38 point symmetry would lead to the common magnetic properties .",
    "therefore it should be noted that the point symmetry @xmath38 might play a crucial role to realize a quantum spin liquid .",
    "we have found the semiconductor cecd@xmath0p@xmath0 crystallizing into the hexagonal scal@xmath0c@xmath0-type structure , possessing geometrically frustrated ce - triangular lattice .",
    "the physical properties were investigated by measuring @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the fundamental band gap is determined to be approximately 0.75 ev , which is larger than that of cezn@xmath0p@xmath0 .",
    "the localized ce moments do not show long range ordering down to 0.48 k. the magnetic properties of cecd@xmath0p@xmath0 are reminiscent of those of ce@xmath3sn@xmath3o@xmath4 which is the candidate of quantum spin liquid .",
    "the magnetic ordering temperature of cecd@xmath0p@xmath0 is possibly lower than that of cezn@xmath0p@xmath0 , suggesting that cecd@xmath0p@xmath0 is a promising new member of quantum spin liquid .",
    "the rather large band gap of cecd@xmath0p@xmath0 would not favor the occurrence of photoinduced kondo effect .",
