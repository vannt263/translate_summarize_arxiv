    "during the last decade , the growing availability of large databases , the increasing computing powers , as well as the development of reliable data analysis tools , have constituted a better machinery to explore the topological properties of several complex networks from the real world  @xcite .",
    "this has allowed to study a large variety of systems as diverse as social , biological and technological .",
    "the main outcome of this activity has been to reveal that , despite the inherent differences , most of the real networks are characterized by the same topological properties , as for instance relatively small characteristic path lengths and high clustering coefficients ( the so called _ small - world property _ ) @xcite , _ scale - free _ degree distributions @xcite , degree correlations @xcite , and the presence of motifs @xcite and community structures @xcite .",
    "all such features make real networks radically different from regular lattices and random graphs , the standard topologies usually used in modeling and computer simulations .",
    "this has led to a large attention towards the comprehension of the evolution mechanisms that have shaped the topology of a real network , and to the design of new models retaining the most significant properties observed empirically .",
    "_ spatial networks _",
    "are a special class of complex networks whose nodes are embedded in a two or three - dimensional euclidean space and whose edges do not define relations in an abstract space ( such as in networks of acquaintances or collaborations between individuals ) , but are real physical connections @xcite .",
    "typical examples include neural networks @xcite , information / communication networks @xcite , electric power grids @xcite and transportation systems ranging from river @xcite , to airport @xcite and street @xcite networks .",
    "most of the works in the literature , with a few relevant exceptions @xcite , have focused on the characterization of the topological properties of spatial networks , while the spatial aspect has received less attention , when not neglected at all .",
    "however , it is not surprising that the topology of such systems is strongly constrained by their spatial embedding .",
    "for instance , there is a cost to pay for the existence of long - range connections in a spatial network , this having important consequences on the possibility to observe a small - world behavior .",
    "moreover , the number of edges that can be connected to a single node is often limited by the scarce availability of physical space , this imposing some constraints on the degree distributions . in few words ,",
    "spatial networks are different from other complex networks and as such they need to be studied in a different way .",
    "in this paper we focus on a particular class of spatial networks : _ networks of urban street patterns_. we consider a database of 1-square mile samples of different world cities and for each city we construct a spatial graph by associating nodes to street intersections and edges to streets . in this way , each of the nodes of the graph is given a location in a 2-dimensional square , and a real number , representing the length of the corresponding street , is associated to each edge . by construction ,",
    "the resulting graphs are _ planar graphs _ , i.e. graphs forming nodes whenever two edges cross . after a previous work on the distribution of centrality measures @xcite , here",
    "we present a comparative study of the basic properties of spatial networks of different city street patterns .",
    "in particular we evaluate the characteristics of the graphs both at a global and at a local scale .",
    "the main problem with spatial graphs is that , in most of the cases , the random graph or the complete graph are no more a good way to normalize the results .",
    "in fact , the common procedure in relational ( non - spatial ) complex networks is to compare the properties of the original graph derived from the real system with those of some randomized versions of the graph , i.e. of graphs with the same number of nodes and links as the original one , but where the links are distributed at random .",
    "this is , for instance , the standard way proposed by watts and strogatz in ref .",
    "@xcite to assess whether a real system is a small world .",
    "one quantifies the structural properties of the original graph by computing its characteristic path length @xmath0 and clustering coefficient @xmath1 , where @xmath0 measures the typical separation between two vertices in the graph ( a global property ) , whereas @xmath1 measures the cliquishness of a typical neighbourhood ( a local property ) .",
    "then , the graph is a small - world if @xmath0 assume a value close to that obtained for the randomized version of the graph , @xmath2 , while the value of @xmath1 is much larger than @xmath3 .",
    "similarly , in the efficiency - based formalism proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite , a small - world network is defined as a system being extremely efficient in exchanging information both at a global and at a local scale . again , the values of global and local efficiency are compared with those obtained for a randomized version of the graph .",
    "a similar method is used in the counting of short cycles or specific motifs in a graph representing a real system @xcite .",
    "the research of the motifs and cycles is based on matching algorithms counting the total number of occurrences of each motif and each cycle in the original graph and in the randomized ones .",
    "then , a motif or a cycle is statistically significant if it appears in the original graph at a number much higher than in the randomized versions of the graph . in a planar graph ,",
    "as those describing urban street patterns , the randomized version of the graph is not significative because it is almost surely a non - planar graph due to the edge crossings induced by the random rewiring of the edges .",
    "moreover , because of the presence of long - range links , a random graph corresponds to an extremely costly street pattern configuration , where the cost is defined as the sum of street lengths @xcite .",
    "the alternative is to compare urban street patterns with grid - like structures .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we shall consider both _",
    "minimum spanning trees _ and _ greedy triangulations _ induced by the real distribution of nodes in the square .",
    "spanning trees are the planar graphs with the minimum number of links in order to assure connectedness , while greedy triangulations are graphs with the maximum number of links compatible with the planarity .",
    "spanning trees and greedy triangulations will serve as the two extreme cases to normalize the structural measures we are going to compute .",
    "the database we have studied consists of twenty 1-square mile samples of different world cities , selected from the book by allan jacobs @xcite .",
    "we have imported the twenty maps into a gis ( geographic information system ) environment and constructed the correspondent spatial graphs of street networks by using a road - centerline - between - nodes format @xcite .",
    "namely , each urban street pattern is trasformed into a undirected , valued ( weighted ) graph @xmath4 , embedded in the 2-dimensional unit square . in fig .",
    "[ maps ] we show the case for the city of savannah : in the upper - left panel we report the original map , and in upper - right panel the obtained graph .",
    "@xmath5 is the set of @xmath6 nodes representing street intersections and characterized by their positions @xmath7 in the square .",
    "@xmath8 is the set of @xmath9 links representing streets .",
    "the links follow the footprints of real streets and are associated a set of real positive numbers representing the street lengths , @xmath10 .",
    "the graph is then described by the adjacency @xmath11 matrix @xmath12 , whose entry @xmath13 is equal to 1 when there is an edge between @xmath14 and @xmath15 and 0 otherwise , and by a @xmath11 matrix @xmath0 , whose entry @xmath16 is equal to the length of the street connecting node @xmath14 and node @xmath15 . in this way",
    "both the topology and the geography ( metric distances ) of the system will be taken into account .",
    "a list of the considered cities is reported in table [ table1 ] , together with the basic properties of the derived graphs .",
    "the considered cases exhibit striking differences in terms of cultural , social , economic , religious and geographic context .",
    "in particular , they can be roughly divided into two large classes : 1 ) patterns grown throughout a largely self - organized , fine - grained historical process , out of the control of any central agency ; 2 ) patterns realized over a short period of time as the result of a single plan , and usually exhibiting a regular grid - like , structure .",
    "ahmedabad , cairo and venice are the most representative examples of self - organized patterns , while los angeles , richmond , and san francisco are typical examples of mostly - planned patterns .",
    "we have selected two different parts of the city of irvine , ca , ( named irvine 1 and irvine 2 ) for two highly diverse kinds of urban fabrics : the first is a sample of an industrial area showing enormous blocks with few intersections while the second is a typical residential early sixties `` lollipop '' low density suburb based on a tree - like layout with a lot of dead - end streets .",
    "the differences between cities are already evident from the basic properties of the derived graphs .",
    "in fact , the number of nodes @xmath6 , the number of links @xmath9 , and the cost of the wiring , defined as the sum of street lenghts : @xmath17 and measured in meters , assume widely different values , notwithstanding the fact we have considered the same amount of land . notice that ahmedabad has 2870 street intersections and 4387 streets in a surface of 1-square mile , while irvine has only 32 intersections and 37 streets .",
    "ahmedabad and cairo are the cities with the largest cost , while the cost is very small ( less than 40000 meters ) in barcelona , brasilia , irvine , los angeles , new delhi , new york , san francisco , washington and walnut creek .",
    "a large difference is also present in the average edge ( street ) length @xmath18 , that assumes the smallest values in cities as ahmedabad , cairo and venice , and the largest value in san francisco , brasilia , walnut creek and los angeles . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have studied the edges length distribution @xmath19 for the two different classes of cities , showing that self - organized cities show single peak distributions , while mostly planned cities exhibit a multimodal distribution , due to their grid pattern .",
    ".basic properties of the planar graphs obtained from the twenty city samples considered .",
    "@xmath6 is the number of nodes , @xmath9 is the number of edges , @xmath20 and @xmath18 are respectively the total length of edges and the average edge length ( both expressed in meters ) , @xmath21 is the box - counting fractal dimension . [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in table [ table3 ] we report the values of efficiency obtained for each city and for the respective mst and the gt .",
    "the values of @xmath22 and @xmath23 serve to normalize the results , being respectively the minimum and the maximum value of efficiency that can be obtained in a planar graph having the same number of nodes as in the original graph of the city .",
    "notice that irvine 2 is the only case in which @xmath24 .",
    "this is simply due to the fact that irvine 2 is the only city whose corresponding graph is not connected .",
    "consequently , the mst has a smaller number of edges but a higher value of efficiency because it is , by definition , a connected graph .",
    "the main result is that the cities considered , despite their inherent differences , achieve a relatively high value of efficiency , which is in most of the cases about @xmath25 of the maximum value of the efficiency in a planar graph , @xmath23 .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite we define the relative efficiency @xmath26 as : @xmath27 of course , the counterpart of an increase in efficiency is an increase in the cost of construction , i.e. an increase in the number and length of the edges .",
    "the cost of construction can be quantified by using the measure @xmath20 defined in formula ( [ eq : cost ] ) . given a set of @xmath6 nodes , the shortest ( minimal cost ) planar graph that connects all nodes correspons to the mst , while a good approximation for the maximum cost planar graph is given by the gt .",
    "we thus define a normalized cost measure , @xmath28 , as : @xmath29 by definition the mst has a relative cost @xmath30 , while gt has @xmath31 . in fig .",
    "[ erel ] we plot for each city @xmath26 as a function of @xmath28 .    , and relative efficiency , @xmath26 . each point in the plot",
    "represent a city .",
    "the point of coordinates ( 0,0 ) would correspond to the cost / efficiency of the mst while the point ( 1,1 ) would correspond to the gt network .",
    "irvine 2 , having coordinates ( 0.175,-0.398 ) , i.e. a negative value of relative efficiency , has been plotted instead as having coordinates ( 0.175,0 ) . ]",
    "the cities can be a - priori divided into different classes : 1 ) medieval fabrics , including both arabic ( ahmedabad and cairo ) and european ( bologna , london , venice , and vienna ) ; 2 ) grid - iron fabrics ( barcelona , los angeles , new york , richmond , savannah and san francisco ) ; 3 ) modernist fabrics ( brasilia and irvine 1 ) ; 4 ) baroque fabrics ( new delhi and washington ) ; 5 ) mixed fabrics ( paris and seoul ) ; 6 ) `` lollipop '' layouts ( irvine 2 and walnut creek ) .",
    "we shall see that the plot @xmath26 vs. @xmath32 has a certain capacity to characterize the different classes of cities listed above .",
    "the plot indicates an overall increasing behavior of @xmath26 as function of @xmath28 , with a saturation at @xmath33 for values of @xmath34 .",
    "grid - iron patterns exhibit a high value of relative efficiency , about @xmath35 of the efficiency of the gt , with a relative cost which goes from @xmath36 to @xmath37 .",
    "the three grid - iron cities ( new york , savannah and san francisco ) with the largest value of efficiency , @xmath33 , have respectively a cost equal to 0.342 , 0.354 and 0.383 .",
    "medieval patterns have in general a lower cost and efficiency than grid - iron patterns althouh , in some cases as ahmedabad and cairo ( the two medieval cities with the largest efficiency ) , they can also reach a value of @xmath33 with a smaller cost equal to 0.29 .",
    "modernist and `` lollipop '' layouts are those with the smallest value of cost but also with the smallest value of efficiency .",
    "we have proposed a method to characterize both the local and the global properties of spatial graphs representing urban street patterns .",
    "our results show that a comparative analysis on the structure of different world cities is possible by the introduction of two limiting auxiliary graphs , the mst and the gt , a certain level of structural similarities across cities as well as some difference are well captured by counting cycles and by measuring normalized efficiency and cost of the graphs .",
    "the method can be applied to other planar graphs of different nature , as highway or railway networks .",
