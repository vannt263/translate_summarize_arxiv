    "sho s are ubiquitous in physics.any potential admitting stable equilibrium can be expanded as a taylor series around the point of equilibrium and can be shown to have a simple harmonic oscillatory behavior for small oscillation around that point.on the other hand , sometimes geometry helps us visualize certain things compared to the algebra involved in the problem .",
    "the equation of motion governing the motion of sho is : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the natural frequency of the oscillator,@xmath2 is time of observation and @xmath3 is displacement from origin i.e point of stable equilibrium .",
    "the solution to this equation is ,    @xmath4    where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are respectively the amplitude and the initial phase , determined from given initial or boundary conditions .",
    "+ first , justification is given why the diagram in , what we will be dealing with , depicts sho .",
    "then , using this diagram , we solve a boundary value problem in which position of the sho is specified to be @xmath7,@xmath8 at time instances respectively @xmath9 , and we are required to find the amplitude and intial phase of the oscillator.we also do the same for an initial value problem , where at one instant of time , position and velocity of the oscillator is given .",
    "+ of course the boundary value problem can be solved algrebaically in a straight forward manner . the geometry supplies us with a new way of obtaining the familiar results .",
    "in , two circles , of same radius and touching each other externally , are drawn .",
    "their radius and orientations are to be specified later .",
    "we claim that the following represents motion of a sho in the sense that if a point is moving along this curve then its distance from the origin vary with time in the same way as the distance(not , displacement ) of a sho from the origin .",
    "we also identify the polar angle the point makes with x - axis to be @xmath10          note , to prove the claim we only need one circle.[see ] let @xmath11 be the centre of the circle , with @xmath12 being the diameter whose length is @xmath5 .",
    "draw , a chord @xmath13 .",
    "let , @xmath13 be @xmath3 .",
    "suppose @xmath13 makes an angle @xmath14 with the diameter.so , @xmath15 since,@xmath16 is @xmath17 . since , @xmath18 , so is satisfied .",
    "and thus our claim is proved .",
    "now we come to the boundary value problem .",
    "suppose , we are given positions of the oscillators at two time instants , @xmath19 and @xmath20 i.e. in a diagram like , two lines from the origin @xmath13 and @xmath21 having lengths @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively , are given ( ) .",
    "so as per previous convention , @xmath24.now ,    1 .",
    "if @xmath25(in anticlockwise sense ) , then draw the circumcircle of @xmath26 .",
    "if @xmath27(in anticlockwise sense),then reflect @xmath21 through the origin and define the reflected line as @xmath21 , now we have made sure that @xmath25 , in fact @xmath28,now we can draw the circumcircle of @xmath26 .",
    "is discussed later . ]",
    "reflect this circle about origin to get a pair of externally touching circles and note @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the reflections of @xmath12 and @xmath21 respectively.let @xmath31.we note that the diameter,@xmath12 of the circle is amplitude ; and the angle it makes with the x axis is minus of the initial phase @xmath6 .",
    "first assume both of @xmath7 and @xmath8 are positive and then @xmath32.later we relax this restriction .",
    "join points to get @xmath33 , @xmath34.since diameter is the biggest of all the chords , so the diameter @xmath12 is the amplitude of oscillation .",
    "we note that , @xmath35 since the angles are circumferential and generated by the same chord @xmath21 .",
    "applying @xmath36 rule[[ref2 ] ] on@xmath37 , [ ] @xmath38 combining we get , @xmath39 as @xmath12 is diameter so,@xmath40,and @xmath36 rule[[ref2 ] ] on @xmath41 implies : @xmath42 where the last equation follows using . from the triangle @xmath26 using cosine rule[[ref2 ] ] we get : @xmath43    from there we come up with : @xmath44    @xmath12 gives the amplitude of the sho .",
    "now , if @xmath7 and @xmath8 have opposite signs then @xmath45 and a reflection of @xmath21 is required , and then @xmath46;so altogether the form of , is retained if we redifine @xmath47 . and",
    "lastly if both of @xmath7 and @xmath8 are negative the form is same as , without any sort of redefinition of @xmath48 .",
    "+ so in general , amplitude @xmath5 is , @xmath49 to know @xmath6 we are required to measure the angle , diameter makes with the @xmath50 axis . from the figure it is clear : @xmath51 so we have the complete solution with amplitude and initial phase .",
    "the uniqueness of the solution lies in the fact whether you can draw those circles uniquely or not , given the boundary conditions .",
    "@xmath52    it means , we are specifying the postion after integral time period.so for @xmath53 we do not have any solution at all.if they are equal , it means @xmath13 and @xmath21 are identical , and the problem can not admit an unique solution as we require at least three non collinear points to construct a circle uniquely . with @xmath54 points ( including origin )",
    "we can have infinitely many circles each corresponding to a solution satisfying given boundary condition .",
    "@xmath55    if the boundary condition does not satisfy @xmath56 , the system does not admit any solution .",
    "else @xmath13 and @xmath21 are diametrically opposite , and @xmath57.here also we can not draw any unique externally touching circle as the three points including origin is collinear .",
    "so we can have infinitely many circles each corresponding to a solution satisfying boundary condition .",
    "@xmath58    in that case we do not have three non collinear points.but we can still come up with an unique solution(satisfying boundary condition ) by drawing a circle with diameter of * nonzero * @xmath59 and then reflecting it about origin .",
    "@xmath60    we have infinitely many solution provided @xmath61,with one solution corresponding to the situation that the particle does not oscillate at all .",
    "first of all , note the solution to sho implies , @xmath62 where @xmath63.geometrically , what it means is the velocity vector can be obtained by rotating the radius vector by @xmath64 in countercloclkwise sense and multiplying it by @xmath1 . in case of initial value problem",
    "we are given position and velocity at one instant of time , so if we divide the magnitude of velocity vector by @xmath1 we essentially obtain position vector after a quarter time period i.e @xmath64 , so our problem reduces to a boundary value problem .",
    "the idea is stated below :    let us consider the following with @xmath65 and @xmath66 , where @xmath7 and @xmath67 are initial displacement and initial velocity of the sho.rotate @xmath21 clockwise by an angle of @xmath68.cut @xmath69 such that @xmath70.now draw the circumcircle of @xmath71.the diameter of the circle will give amplitude of oscillation while the angle it makes with x axis will give the initial phase @xmath6 .        since our problem is now reduced to a boundary value problem as we previously dealt with , only inital value problem fixes @xmath48 ( @xmath72 ) [ ] equals to @xmath73/2 .",
    "@xmath74    so the solution is : @xmath75        @xmath76    in the same way as discussed in case:[case3 ] of boundary value ( b.v ) problem , we draw a unique circle of diameter of @xmath77 whichever is nonzero .",
    "@xmath78    quite contrary to the case:[case4 ] of the b.v problem here we have only one solution that the particle does not oscillate at all because in whatever way we draw the circle we have to traverse an angle of @xmath79[see the ] to come to @xmath80,starting from @xmath80 .",
    "but we know , the angle between @xmath13 and @xmath69 is @xmath68.so it can only be possible when the circles degenerate into a point of origin i.e no oscillation .",
    "although the above argument was entirely for sho , but one can generalize it to any symmetric potential where oscillation is taking place about the point on symmetry axis . for those cases , instead of circles in , one gets other geometrical shapes .",
    "but one fact remains true , that the same two lobes are obtained , and as a whole the figure remains symmetric about @xmath81 line .",
    "now , because of this , if the values after half a time period are specified then , one can reflect the point about the origin , and then the two points coincide .",
    "so , we can be sure that no unique solution to the problem is possible , since with just origin and one point one draw any curves .",
    "now , from newton s law , we know we require just two points to draw a unique curve ( except for special initial or boundary values ) , but at this moment it is not clear how can we argue about this necessity purely from geometry , for circles it was possible since we need just three points in general to draw a curve .",
    "it is satisfying that simple geometrical considerations solves the aforementioned problems .",
    "one usually uses algebraic methods to tackle these problems , but the uniqueness and existence of solutions is very transparent in this approach.these type of diagrams can give us an intuitive feeling about the system without any direct dependence on algebric machinery.the whole scenario hinges on the fact gives a diagram like mentioned above when plotted in ploar co-ordinates.so any system ( like damped , driven harmonic oscillator ) whose solution can be reduced to this form by proper substitution , we can employ this geometric method to yield solution to boundary and initial value problems .",
