    "a measurement of this branching fraction , combined with the value of @xmath20 obtained from other decay modes such as @xmath21 , allows us to determine @xmath19 , which is needed to extract @xmath22 from measurements of @xmath23 mixing .",
    "the theoretical expectation for the branching fraction of @xmath24 lies in the range @xmath25 .",
    "since the branching fraction is proportional to the square of the mass of the charged lepton , the branching fractions for @xmath1 and @xmath26 are suppressed by factors of 225 and @xmath27 , respectively ( `` _ helicity suppression _ '' ) . although branching fractions at these levels are beyond the reach of the belle experiment with the current data sample , an observation of either of the latter decay modes would be a clear indication of physics beyond the sm .",

    "it is natural to extend the @xmath9 searches to the corresponding radiative modes . because of the additional photon",
    ", helicity suppression does not occur in these modes ; hence @xmath32 decays are predicted to occur with rates comparable to or possibly larger than @xmath1 decay .",
    "the @xmath32 decay has been of theoretical interest as a means of probing aspects of the strong and weak interactions of a heavy quark system  @xcite-@xcite . in theory",
    ", there are two contributions to @xmath33 : the internal bremsstrahlung ( ib ) process and the structure - dependent ( sd ) process  @xcite . in the ib process",
    ", a photon is emitted in either the initial or final state .",
    "the amplitude for this process is , however , suppressed by both helicity conservation and the electromagnetic coupling to the photon . in the sd process",
