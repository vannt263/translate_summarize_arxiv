    "we consider a particular soluble model and numerical results related to such equations . we show that from the microscopic quantum - mechanical laws a sort of @xmath0`irreversible' behavior emerges under the following conditions : a privileged initial condition ( no correlation between the brownian oscillator and the bath ) , a relevance criterion arising from the form of the hamiltonian , which distinguishes the brownian particle from the bath , and a natural extra - dynamical hypothesis in order to interpret the exact dynamical evolution .",
    "that is , to consider such a process during a time scale of observation smaller than the recurrence time and with a minimum resolution such that fluctuations can not be seen ( see figures of sec .",

    "we firstly see that @xmath47 grows from 0 to @xmath48 , corresponding to the zeno regime .",
    "secondly , it oscillates around @xmath50 as a consequence of the presence of fluctuations which modulates the exponential decay . after that ,",
    "the amplitude of these oscillations increases in time because of the relative variations between fluctuations and the exponential decay ( @xmath51 become more important when the system reaches equilibrium .",
    "finally , we see the effect of recurrences also in @xmath52 it is interesting to stress the fact that @xmath47 allows us to visualize the presence of fluctuations which , at the same time scale , are hidden in the observable macroscopic profiles ."
