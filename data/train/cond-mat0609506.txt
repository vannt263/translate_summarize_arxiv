    "figure  [ ple ] depicts the ple spectra of the three samples a1 , a2 and a3 which were respectively undoped , @xmath0-doped and @xmath1-doped .",
    "the peaks observed are associated with transitions between bound levels in the qds : a low - energy peak is observed at @xmath450 mev , a second peak is found at @xmath475 mev , a third peak is found at @xmath4110 mev .",
    "for qds with a perfect cylindrical symmetry , the ground and first excited states in both the conduction and valence band are @xmath5 and @xmath1-like respectively . in order to associate the excitation peaks with transitions in the qds",
    ", a magnetic field @xmath6 is applied along the sample s growth axis , as it is well known that the effect of a magnetic field is different for @xmath5 , @xmath1 and @xmath7 states .",
    "the energy of the ple peaks as a function of magnetic field is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] for sample a3 . as the magnetic field increases , the peak that was initially at @xmath4 75 mev splits into two separate peaks : one peak that increases in energy and a second peak that decreases in energy .",
    "these peaks can be associated with @xmath1-like transitions .",
    "let us now take a closer look at the oscillator strengths of the lower energy peaks , as shown in fig .",
    "[ ple ] . at 0 t ,",
    "the intensity of the low - energy peak at 50 mev is about 20% of that of the 75 mev peak . as the magnetic field increases , an exchange of oscillator strength between these two peaks is observed . for samples",
    "a1 and a3 , at 20 t",
    "the two peaks have the same intensity and by 24 t the oscillator strength of the low - energy peak has surpassed that of its neighbor . for sample a2 ,",
    "the energy difference between the two peaks at 0 t is smaller and therefore the anticrossing is observed at a lower magnetic field .",
    "such a behavior can not be explained using a purely electronic model .",
    "it is necessary to use a model that takes into account the coupling between the optical phonons and the photo - created electron - hole pair in the qd .",
    "the noninteracting exciton - phonon states are labelled @xmath8 , where @xmath9 are purely electronic levels .",
    "@xmath10 denotes the ensemble of the @xmath11 lo - phonon states in the @xmath12 modes . the frhlich hamiltonian @xmath13 couples states which differ by one phonon .    @xmath14\\ ] ]    where @xmath15 .",
    "the term @xmath16 includes in its definition the frhlich constant which is taken as @xmath17 , consistent with precedent polaron studies in qds @xcite .    in order to calculate the excitonic polarons ,",
    "we have used the dispersionless lo phonon approximation , which allows the very accurate calculation of polaron levels in qds @xcite .",
    "an lo phonon energy of @xmath18 = 36 mev has been used .",
    "in addition to frhlich coupling terms , coulomb interactions and in - plane anisotropy have been taken into account .",
    "the energy dispersions and oscillator strengths of the polaron states , presented in fig .  3 , were calculated using an in - plane effective mass for electrons @xmath19= 0.07@xmath20 and for holes @xmath21= 0.22@xmath20 , in agreement with fir intraband magnetospectrocopy results .",
    "the other dots parameters were chosen in order to fit the experimental values of both the intraband @xmath5-@xmath1 electronic ( hole ) transitions [ 47 mev ( 22 mev ) ] and the interband ground state energy ( detection energy of @xmath22 mev ) . more details on polaron calculation can be found in reference @xcite .",
    "the numerical diagonalization of the full hamiltonian gives us the polaron energy transitions .",
    "the energy positions as a function of magnetic field are in good agreement with our data , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ]  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the frhlich coupling between the states @xmath23 and @xmath24 is responsible for the experimentally observed strong anticrossing .",
    "we calculate also the interband absorptions for an inhomogeneous ensemble of dots .",
    "the solid lines in fig .  4 represent the calculated absorption spectra at different magnetic fields .",
    "we compare our calculated interband absorption spectra with the ple experimental data .",
    "the full squares are data points taken for sample a3 .",
    "the evolution of the oscillator strengths of the absorptions with the magnetic field is very well described by our model .",
    "we are able to predict the exchange of oscillator strength observed in our results demonstrating the validity of our analysis and the existence of excitonic polarons .",
    "similar agreement is found for results obtained for sample a1 and a2 .",
    "we have investigated the interband transitions in several ensembles of self - assembled inas / gaas qds by using ple spectroscopy .",
    "the magnetic field dependence of the interband transitions allows their unambiguous assignment .",
    "when two exciton - lo phonon states have close enough energies with phonon occupations which differ by one , a large anticrossing is theoretically predicted . such a situation",
    "is experimentally induced in our samples by the applied magnetic field for the two interband transitions ( @xmath25 ) and a strong anticrossing is actually observed in all the investigated samples .",
    "we have calculated the coupling between the mixed exciton - lo phonon states using the frhlich hamiltonian and we have determined the energies and oscillator strengths of the interband transitions .",
    "our model accounts well for the experimental data , evidencing that the excitons and lo - phonons are in a strong coupling regime in qds and the interband transitions occur between excitonic polaron states .",
    "finally , we believe that the existence of excitonic polarons could present important consequences for the energy relaxation in excited qds and for the coherence decay times of the fundamental optical transitions .    the laboratoire pierre aigrain is a  unit mixte de recherche \" ( umr 8551 ) between ecole normale superieure , the university pierre et marie curie ( paris 6 ) and the cnrs .",
    "we would like to thank g. bastard and s. hameau for very valuable and fruitful discussions ."
