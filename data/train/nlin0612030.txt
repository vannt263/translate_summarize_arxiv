    "recently , many dynamical models , inspired by analogies with physical systems , have been proposed to describe a variety of phenomena occurring in social dynamics @xcite .",
    "examples include the emergence of cooperation and self - organization , propagation of information and epidemics , opinion formation , economic exchanges and evolution of social structures . in this context ,",
    "axelrod s model @xcite for the dissemination of culture among interacting agents in a social system has attracted much attention among physicists .",
    "the concept of culture introduced by axelrod refers to a set of individual features or attributes that are subject to social influence .",
    "agents can interact with their neighbors in the system according to the cultural similarities that they share . from the point of view of statistical physics , this model is appealing because it exhibits a nonequilibrium transition between an ordered final frozen state ( a global homogeneous culture ) and a disordered ( culturally fragmented ) one @xcite .",
    "several extensions of this model have recently been investigated .",
    "for example , cultural drift has been modeled as noise acting on the frozen disordered configurations @xcite .",
    "the effects of mass media has been considered as external @xcite or autonomous @xcite influences acting on the system .",
    "the role of the topology of the social network of interactions have also been addressed @xcite .",
    "other extensions include the consideration of quantitative instead of qualitative values for the cultural traits @xcite .",
    "these studies have revealed that axelrod s model is robust in the sense that its main properties persists in all those cases . in particular",
    ", the final frozen states invariably consist of one or more homogeneous cultural groups .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce a constraint on the number of situations in which interaction may take place , in order to lift the unavoidable homogeneity in the final states of the above models .",
    "our model is motivated by the idea that generally individuals tend to maintain a minimum degree of identity by keeping some cultural features different from those of their neighbors .",
    "this restriction naturally leads to the persistence of complex patterns of diversity in the cultural groups present in the final state of the system .",
    "the model is explained in section 2 . in section 3 , the results of numerical simulations are presented , showing the patterns of diversity in the final frozen states .",
    "the statistical properties that characterize intracultural diversity are calculated in section 4 .",
    "conclusions are presented in section 5 .",
    "axelrod s model @xcite considers a square lattice network of @xmath0 elements with open boundaries and nearest neighbor interactions .",
    "the state of element @xmath1 is given by a cultural vector of @xmath2 components ( cultural features ) @xmath3 .",
    "each component @xmath4 can adopt any of @xmath5 integer values ( cultural traits ) in the set @xmath6 .",
    "starting from a random initial state the network evolves at each time step following these simple rules : i ) an element @xmath1 and one of its four neighbors @xmath7 is selected at random .",
    "ii ) if the overlap , defined as @xmath8 , ( number of shared features ) is in the range @xmath9 , the pair @xmath10 is said to be active with a probability of interaction equal to @xmath11 .",
    "iii ) in case of interaction , one of the unshared features @xmath12 is selected at random and element @xmath1 adopts the trait @xmath13 , thus decreasing in one unit the overlap of the pair @xmath10 .    in any finite network",
    "the dynamics settles into a frozen state , characterized by either @xmath14 or @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "homogeneous or monocultural states correspond to @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and obviously there are @xmath17 possible configurations of this state .",
    "inhomogeneous or multicultural states consist of two or more homogeneous domains interconnected by elements with zero overlap .",
    "a domain , or a cultural region , is a set of contiguous sites with identical cultural traits .",
    "castellano et al .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the final states of the system experience a transition from ordered states ( homogeneous culture ) for @xmath18 to disordered states ( cultural fragmented ) for @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is a critical value that depends on @xmath2 .    in order to allow for diversity",
    "we introduce a parameter @xmath21 such that a pair @xmath10 is considered active if the overlap is in the range @xmath22 , with @xmath23 .",
    "there is no restriction on which of the @xmath21 features can not be exchanged by an active pair .",
    "the case @xmath24 recovers the original axelrod s model , whereas @xmath25 results in frozen configurations for all possible initial configurations .",
    "the number of possible frozen states is the number of configurations in which neighbors can not longer interact ; thus increasing @xmath21 results in an increase of this number .",
    "the parameter @xmath21 reduces the number of situations in which interactions may take place . in the context of social dynamics ,",
    "the ratio @xmath26 can be seen as a measure of individual nonconformity .",
    "a cultural region is a set of contiguous sites that possess the same cultural vector , whereas a cultural zone is defined as a set of contiguous sites that share one or more cultural traits ; elements in a cultural zone are said to have a ",
    "compatible \" culture @xcite .",
    "cultural zones appear as transient states in the original axelrod s model , but in the final state only cultural regions are present .",
    "when @xmath27 , cultural zones will usually be present in the final state because then contiguous sites have an overlap @xmath28 . the model can be modified by fixing in advance a subset of features that the elements of a cultural zone must share in the final state .",
    "as an example of the effects resulting from the inclusion of the parameter @xmath21 in axelrod s model , we shall consider a system of size @xmath29 with @xmath30 , and @xmath31 , starting from random initial conditions .",
    "for @xmath24 , the system converges to a homogeneous state , i.e. , a single cultural region , since @xmath32 . for @xmath33 the final state",
    "consists of a single cultural zone possessing few surviving traits .",
    "we denote by @xmath34 the number of times that the trait value @xmath35 appears in the @xmath36th feature of the cultural vectors in the system .",
    "that is , @xmath37 . for a particular realization in a system of size @xmath29",
    ", table 1 shows @xmath34 for the final state .",
    "the first row in table 1 shows that @xmath38 and for the remaining traits @xmath39 ; that is , all the @xmath40 cultural vectors have reached the value @xmath41 in their first feature .",
    "note that all @xmath40 elements also share the traits associated to features @xmath42 , and @xmath43 . in features",
    "@xmath44 , and @xmath45 only @xmath46 different values of traits survive ; while in features @xmath47 and @xmath48 there appear @xmath49 different values of traits .",
    "the fraction of trait values that disappear during the evolution towards the final state of the system is @xmath50 .",
    "therefore , for the realization in table 1 , about @xmath51 of all the trait values existing in the cultural vectors at the beginning have disappeared in the final state of the system .    in the final state",
    "there are 47 different cultural vectors in the system .",
    "unexpectedly , the abundance of these vectors follows a nonuniform distribution .",
    "table 2 shows the distribution of the 15 most abundant cultural vectors in the final state .",
    "these vectors are ranked according to their abundance .",
    "the abundance of the vector of rank @xmath52 is denoted by @xmath53 and it is also indicated in table 2 .",
    "we define the fraction of elements having the cultural vector with rank @xmath52 as @xmath54 .",
    "note that about half of the elements in the final state share its cultural vector among the seven most common vectors .",
    "figure 1 shows the pattern of the final state of the system .",
    "the labels indicate the rank of the cultural vector corresponding to each site .",
    "contiguous sites having identical cultural vectors are joined by lines .",
    "elements with identical cultural vectors tend to form domains , in spite that neighbors with overlap @xmath55 do not interact .",
    "the number of surviving traits monotonically decreases during the evolution of the system toward its final state .",
    "when @xmath24 the number of surviving traits in the final state is @xmath2 if @xmath56 ( all elements are identical and therefore there is one trait per feature ) . as shown above , for @xmath57 the number of surviving traits in the final state is greater than @xmath2 but much smaller than its maximum possible value of @xmath58 . on the other hand ,",
    "the size of the largest domain is equal to @xmath59 for @xmath24 and @xmath56 , while for @xmath57 the largest group involves only a fraction of the elements in the system .",
    "figure  2 shows the evolution of both , the number of surviving traits and the fraction of elements having the most abundant cultural vector , @xmath60 , in a system of size @xmath61 , for @xmath24 and @xmath33 .",
    "figure 3 shows the average fraction of elements with the most abundant vector @xmath62 as a function of @xmath5 , for several values of the parameter @xmath21 in a system of size @xmath63 and @xmath30 . for @xmath24 ,",
    "there exist a critical value @xmath20 at which the order parameter @xmath62 exhibits an abrupt transition from a homogeneous , monocultural state , characterized by @xmath64 , to a disordered , multicultural state , where @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "the value @xmath20 is not very sensitive to the variation of the parameter @xmath21 . for @xmath27 and @xmath18 ,",
    "the value of @xmath62 is less than @xmath41 , indicating the presence of intracultural diversity in the single surviving cultural zone ( there are no neighbors with zero overlap ) .",
    "figure 4 shows the average fraction of cultural vectors @xmath66 by rank @xmath52 , for different system sizes .",
    "each curve is the average over @xmath67 realizations of initial conditions . for the parameter values used in fig . 4 ( @xmath68 ) there is a single cultural zone in the final state but several cultural vectors survive having a distribution that depends on the system size .",
    "the dispersion on each curve is larger for low and for high values of @xmath52 than for intermediate values of the rank .",
    "the dispersion for low values of @xmath52 reflects the competition between the more abundant vectors during the evolution towards the frozen state . on the other hand ,",
    "the dispersion for large values of @xmath52 is mostly due to the fluctuations on the total number of different vectors present in the final state .",
    "the frozen patterns in a cultural zone are complex , as shown in figure 1 .",
    "the cultural diversity can be characterized in terms of the distribution of the cultural affinity between any two elements @xmath1 and @xmath7 in the system , defined as @xmath69 .",
    "figure 5 shows the average distribution of the cultural affinities @xmath70 of all pairs of elements in the system , averaged over @xmath43 realizations .",
    "the three curves on each panel in fig .",
    "5 correspond to three different values of @xmath5 . in the case",
    "that @xmath24 , the distribution for @xmath18 consists of a single peak at the value @xmath71 , corresponding a homogeneous state , while for @xmath19 a second peak appears at @xmath72 , reflecting the presence of multiple domains . as shown in fig .",
    "@xmath48 , for @xmath57 intracultural diversity is manifested as a wide spectrum of cultural affinities present in the system . as @xmath21 increases , the distribution of cultural affinities shifts towards @xmath72 , reflecting the increase of intracultural diversity within the cultural zones .",
    "the spatial distribution of cultural diversity can be characterized by the average shell affinity @xmath73 defined as @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the set of elements in a square shell of radius @xmath76 centered in element @xmath1 ( the unit of distance is one site ) , and @xmath77 is the number of elements on this shell .",
    "figure 6 shows @xmath73 for several values of @xmath21 .",
    "the average shell affinity @xmath73 is well fitted by the relation @xmath78 we find the scaling @xmath79 and @xmath80 for a wide range of values of @xmath2 , @xmath21 and @xmath56 .",
    "the slope @xmath81 characterizes the gradient of intracultural diversity or _ cultural cline_. extrapolation of equation @xmath82 to @xmath83 allows for a definition of a characteristic distance @xmath84 $ ] between two elements that have zero overlap ; a concept that can be applied to the study of the spatial distribution of related cultures .",
    "these results suggest that the relevant quantity for the description of intracultural diversity is the ratio @xmath26 .",
    "in order to allow for individual nonconformity in the axelrod s model for cultural dissemination , we have introduced a parameter @xmath21 that reduces the maximum number of shared features for interaction .",
    "the inclusion of this parameter maintains the main features of the axelrod s model , corresponding to @xmath24 .",
    "in particular , there is a nonequilibrium transition from a single cultural zone to a multicultural state at about the same critical value @xmath20 at which the axelrod s model exhibits a transition from a homogeneous , monocultural region , to a multicultural state .",
    "however , the addition of parameter @xmath21 set the stage for the occurrence of complex patterns of intracultural diversity in cultural zones .",
    "the intracultural diversity associated to the constraint @xmath27 is manifested in the appearance of a distribution of the abundance of cultural vectors by rank inside cultural zones .",
    "we found that this distribution is sensitive to the size of the zone , as shown in figure 4 .",
    "we have introduced the concept of cultural affinity between any two elements in order to characterize intracultural diversity in the system .",
    "the cultural affinity among all the elements in the system for @xmath57 shows a wide distribution in contrast to the case @xmath24 where the cultural affinity can only take the values @xmath41 when @xmath56 , or @xmath41 and @xmath85 when @xmath86 .    the cultural affinity between elements separated by a given distance @xmath73 has led us to the concept of cultural cline defined as @xmath81 .",
    "we found that @xmath73 depends only on the ratio @xmath26 since it is well fitted by the relation @xmath87 for a wide range of values of @xmath2 , @xmath21 and @xmath56 .",
    "the model presented here may be useful to describe the emergence of cultural gradients such as dialects , gastronomic customs , etc , in geographical areas . in the biological context",
    ", this model can also be adapted to the study of phenotype clines .",
    "for instance , it have been proposed that the evolution of female mating preferences can greatly amplify large - scale geographic variation in male secondary sexual characters and produce widespread reproductive isolation with no geographic discontinuity @xcite .",
