    "since the spectral density of the sum rule ( [ final - b-1])-([final - b-3 ] ) @xmath187 is either proptional to @xmath188 or @xmath189 , the continuum has to be subtracted carefully .",
    "we use the value of the continuum threshold @xmath70 determined from the corresponding mass sum rule at the leading order of @xmath173 and @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "the lower limit of @xmath12 is determined by the requirement that the terms of higher twists in the operator expansion is reasonably smaller than the leading twist , say @xmath190 of the latter .",

    "we now turn to the numerical evaluation of the sum rules for the coupling constants .",

    "and the central value corresponds to @xmath211gev and @xmath206gev except that we use @xmath207gev for the sum rule ( [ m-4 ] ) .",
    "note we have only considered the uncertainty due to the variations of the borel parameter and the continuum threshold in the above expressions .",
    "there are other sources of uncertainty .",
    "the input parameters @xmath170 and @xmath172 are associated with the photon distribution amplitude .",
    "especially the value of @xmath170 has been estimated with qcd sum rules @xcite and with the octet baryon magnetic moments as inputs using the external field method @xcite .",
    "both approaches yield consistent results @xmath213 gev . with this value the octet , decuplet and heavy baryon magnetic moments derived using the external field method are in good agreement with the experimental data .",
    "so we expect its accuracy is better than @xmath204 .",
    "the value of @xmath172 has been estimated with the vector meson dominance model also with an accuracy of @xmath204 @xcite .",
    "the light cone sum rules for the coupling constants @xmath214 and the mass sum rules for the heavy hadrons in hqet both receive large perturbative qcd corrections .",
    "but their ratio does not depend on radiative corrections strongly because of large cancellation @xcite . in the present case ,",
    "the uncertainty of the coupling constants @xmath214 due to radiative corrections is expected to around @xmath215 while the couplings @xmath216 etc are affected significantly .",
    "another possible source of error is the truncation of the light cone expansion at twist four .",
    "we take the sum rules for @xmath217 for example . at @xmath211 gev ,",
    "the twist - four term involved with @xmath218 is only @xmath219 of the leading twist term after making double borel transformation to ( [ quark1 ] ) .",
    "even after the subtraction of the continuum and excited states contribution the twist - four term is only @xmath220 of the twist - two one in ( [ final - b-1 ] ) .",
    "so the light cone expansion converges quickly .",
    "we expect the contribution of higher twist distribution amplitudes to be small .",
    "we have calculated the coupling constant in the leading order of hqet .",
    "the @xmath83 correction is sizable for the charm system .",
    "but for the bottom system the @xmath83 correction is typically around @xmath221 for the pionic coupling constants @xcite .",
    "we expect the @xmath83 correction to the electromagnetic coupling constants is of the same order . the inherent uncertainty of the method of qcd sum rules is not included , which is typically about @xmath215 .",
    "we apply the leading order formulas obtained above to the excited states of bottomed hadrons using the central values of the coupling constants in the previous section . @xmath226",
    "the uncertainty of the decay width is typically about @xmath204 .",
    "we do not present numerical results for the radiative decay widths for the charmed hadrons since @xmath83 corrections are sizable for the charm system while such corrections are only a few percent of the leading order term for the bottom system @xcite .",
    "in summary we have calculated the coupling constants of photons with the heavy baryons and the lowest three heavy meson doublets using the light cone qcd sum rules with the photon wave functions in the leading order of hqet .",
    "we hope these calculations will be tested in the future experiments .",
