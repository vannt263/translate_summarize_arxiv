    "the issue to enlarge or revise the general relativity ( gr ) comes out since several questions in modern physics could strictly depend on the fact that it is a classical theory .",
    "this means that quantum effects ( ultra - violet scales ) are not considered in gr . besides",
    ", it seems to fail at galactic and cosmological scales ( infra - red scales ) leading to the disturbing puzzles of dark energy and dark matter .",
    "quantum effects should be considered in any theory which deals with gravity at a fundamental level . assuming a * u*@xmath1 manifold , instead of * v*@xmath1 , is the first straightforward generalization which tries to include the spin fields into the geometrical framework of gr .",
    "the einstein ",
    "cartan  sciama ",
    "kibble ( ecsk ) theory is one of the most serious attempts in this direction @xcite .",
    "however , this mere inclusion of spin matter fields does not exhaust the role of torsion which gives important contributions in any fundamental theory .",
    "for example , a torsion field appears in ( super)string theory , if we consider the fundamental string modes ; we need , at least , a scalar mode and two tensor modes : a symmetric and an antisymmetric one .",
    "the latter one , in the low energy limit , is a torsion field @xcite .",
    "furthermore , several attempts of unification between gravity and electromagnetism have to take into account torsion in four and in higher  dimensional theories such as kaluza - klein ones @xcite .",
    "any theory of gravity considering twistors needs the inclusion of torsion @xcite while supergravity is the natural arena in which torsion , curvature and matter fields are treated under the same standard @xcite .    besides",
    ", several people agree with the line of thinking that curvature and torsion could play specific roles in cosmological dynamics , at early and late epochs .",
    "in fact , the interplay of curvature and torsion naturally gives repulsive contributions to the energy ",
    "momentum tensor so that cosmological models become singularity  free and accelerating @xcite .",
    "all these arguments do not allow to neglect torsion in any comprehensive theory of gravity which takes into account the non  gravitational counterpart of the fundamental interactions .",
    "however , in most papers , a clear distinction is not made among the different kinds of torsion .",
    "usually torsion is simply related to the spin ",
    "density of matter , but , very often , it assumes more general meanings .",
    "it can be shown that there are many independent torsion tensors with different properties @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the issue to extended gr to more general actions with respect to the hilbert - einstein one is revealing a very fruitful approach . from a conceptual point of view",
    ", there is no _ a priori _ reason to restrict the gravitational lagrangian to a linear function of the ricci scalar @xmath2 , minimally coupled with matter .",
    "the idea that there are no `` exact '' laws of physics but that the lagrangians of physical interactions are `` stochastic '' functions  with the property that local gauge invariances ( conservation laws ) are well approximated in the low energy limit and that physical constants can vary  has been taken into serious consideration @xcite .    beside fundamental physics motivations ,",
    "all these theories have acquired a huge interest in cosmology due to the fact that they  naturally `` exhibit inflationary behaviors able to overcome the shortcomings of cosmological standard model @xcite .",
    "furthermore , dark energy models mainly rely on the implicit assumption that einstein s gr is the correct theory of gravity , indeed .",
    "nevertheless , its validity at the larger astrophysical and cosmological scales has never been tested @xcite , and it is therefore conceivable that both cosmic speed up and missing matter represent signals of a breakdown in our understanding of gravitation law so that one should consider the possibility that the hilbert - einstein lagrangian , linear in the ricci scalar @xmath2 , should be generalized . following this line of thinking , the choice of a generic function @xmath0 can be derived by matching the data and by the ' ' economic \" requirement that no exotic ingredients have to be added .",
    "this is the underlying philosophy of what is referred to as @xmath0gravity ( see @xcite and references therein ) . in this context , the same cosmological constant",
    "could be removed as an ingredient of the cosmic pie being nothing else but a particular eigenvalue of a general class of theories @xcite .",
    "however @xmath0gravity can be encompassed in the extended theories of gravity being a `` minimal '' extension of gr where ( analytical ) functions of ricci scalar are taken into account .",
    "although higher order gravity theories have received much attention in cosmology , since they are naturally able to give rise to accelerating expansions ( both in the late and in the early universe ) and systematic studies of the phase space of solutions are in progress @xcite , it is possible to demonstrate that @xmath0theories can also play a major role at astrophysical scales .",
    "in fact , modifying the gravity lagrangian can affect the gravitational potential in the low energy limit .",
    "provided that the modified potential reduces to the newtonian one at solar system scales , this implication could represent an intriguing opportunity rather than a shortcoming for @xmath0theories @xcite .",
    "a corrected gravitational potential could offer the possibility to fit the galaxy rotation curves and the density profiles of galaxy clusters without the need of dark matter @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we want to give an overview of the main features of @xmath0gravity theories considering also torsion . after reviewing the basic definitions of torsion and outlying the possibility of a classification in sec.2",
    ", we discuss the field equations of @xmath0gravity with torsion _ in vacuo _",
    "( sec.3 ) and in presence of perfect fluid matter ( sec.4 ) .",
    "analogies and differences with respect to the palatini approach in @xmath3 are stressed .",

    "in addition to this , we recall that the explicit expression of the scalar field @xmath75 as well as of the potential @xmath149 are directly related with the particular form of the function @xmath52",

    "the fact quantity @xmath159 this time is negative ( if , as usual , @xmath160 and @xmath161 are assumed positive ) .",

    "@xmath0gravity seems a viable approach to solve some shortcomings coming from gr , in particular problems related to quantization on curved spacetime and cosmological issues related to early universe ( inflation ) and late time dark components .",
    "it is worth noticing that the scheme of gr is fully preserved and @xmath0 can be considered a straightforward extension where the gravitational action has not to be necessarily linear in the ricci scalar @xmath2 .",
    "we have discussed the possibility that also the torsion field could play an important role in the dynamics being the @xmath164 manifolds a generalization of the pseudo  riemannian manifolds @xmath3 ( torsionless ) usually adopted in gr .",
    "torsion field , in the metric - affine formalism , plays a fundamental role in clarifying the relations between the palatini and the metric approaches : it gives further degrees of freedom which contribute , together with curvature degrees of freedom , to the dynamics .",
    "the aim is to achieve a self - consistent theory where unknown ingredients as dark energy and dark matter ( up to now not detected at a fundamental level ) could be completely `` geometrized '' .",
    "torsion field assumes a relevant role in presence of standard matter since it allows to establish a definite equivalence between scalar - tensor theories and @xmath0gravity , also in relation to conformal transformations . in this case , the chauchy problem results well formulated and well posed depending on the form of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , from a cosmological viewpoint , torsion field could dynamically trigger the amount of dark components giving a straightforward explanation of the coincidence problem @xcite .",

    "<S> we discuss the field equations in empty space and in presence of perfect fluid matter taking into account the analogy with the metric - affine formalism . </S>",
    "<S> the result is that the extra curvature and torsion degrees of freedom can be dealt under the standard of an effective scalar field of fully geometric origin . </S>",
    "<S> the initial value problem for such theories is also discussed . </S>"
