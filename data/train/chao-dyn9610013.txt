    "the derivation of semiclassical periodic orbit formulas for the trace of the quantum green function led to a deeper understanding of the influence of classical dynamics on quantum spectra .",
    "closed periodic orbit expressions have been given by gutzwiller @xcite and balian and bloch @xcite for `` hard chaos '' systems and by berry and tabor @xcite for integrable dynamics .",
    "integrability and hard chaos represent the two extremes on the scale of possible hamiltonian dynamics .",
    "the term `` hard chaos '' introduced by gutzwiller @xcite is , however , not well defined .",
    "it implies , that all periodic orbits are unstable and `` sufficiently '' isolated to allow for the stationary phase approximations in the derivation of the trace formula .",
    "hence , for lack of a better definition , one might say that a system exhibits `` hard chaos '' if the gutzwiller trace formula as it stands is the leading term in a semiclassical expansion in @xmath0 .",
    "neither integrability nor hard chaos is generic in low dimensional bounded hamiltonian dynamics . the variety of classical systems proposed as testing models for the gutzwiller trace formula in the last decade exemplify the problem of finding ideal chaos in the sense described above .",
    "typical hamiltonian systems show a mixture of the two extremes .",
    "chaotic regions in phase space ( containing unstable periodic orbits only ) are interspersed by stable islands , which themselves may have a complicated inner structure consisting of chaotic bands and invariant tori .",
    "the `` stable regions '' reflect locally almost integrable behavior in phase space and can be treated semiclassically by an einstein  brillouin ",
    "keller ( ebk ) approximation @xcite .",
    "semiclassical contributions to the trace of the green function from periodic orbits inside the stable islands are of modified berry  tabor  type as has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "much less is known about a semiclassical treatment of the transition region from the stable island to the outer chaotic neighborhood .",
    "the outer boundary acts as a classically impenetrable wall in two degrees of freedom . a coupling between dynamically separated regions can only be described by complex trajectories @xcite .",
    "although the outer chaotic region contains ( per definition ) only unstable periodic orbits , it shows almost regular behavior near the stable components .",
    "the characteristics for this kind of regularity , also called intermittency in the chaos literature @xcite , is a vanishing liapunov exponent @xmath1 for unstable periodic orbits approaching the island , i.e.@xmath2 where @xmath3 denotes the largest eigenvalue of the stability matrix ( describing the linearized dynamics in the neighborhood of the periodic orbit ) and @xmath4 is the period .",
    "i will show that intermittency in bounded systems leads to leading order corrections in the gutzwiller trace formula .",
    "semiclassical contributions from ( unstable ) periodic orbits approaching the boundary of a stable island show a @xmath0dependent transition from gutzwiller to berry  tabor like behavior .",
    "this allows one to extend the concept of ebk  quantization from a stable region over the marginal stable boundary into its `` chaotic '' neighborhood . + we will derive these results for a specific example , the quarter stadium billiard , ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : stadium ] ) .",
    "this might appear surprising on first sight , because this billiard has been introduced as an example of a dynamical system which is completely ergodic with positive liapunov exponent @xcite .",
    "the stadium billiard has thus been regarded as an ideal model for a `` chaotic '' system .",
    "first indications for the validity of the random matrix conjecture relating the level statistics of individual `` chaotic '' systems to those of an ensemble of random gaussian orthogonal matrices have been found in this billiard @xcite . also the discovery of scarred wave functions @xcite was first made in this system . from then on , the classical and quantum aspects of the stadium billiard were studied intensively both theoretically and in microwave experiments @xcite , making it a standard model in quantum chaology .",
    "the billiard dynamics possesses , however , regularities , which prevents it from being a hard chaos system . the so",
    " called bouncing ball orbits , i.e.  the continuous family of periodic orbits running back and forth in the rectangle , are marginally stable .",
    "another peculiarity of the stadium is the existence of whispering gallery orbits accumulating at the boundary of the billiard .",
    "these orbits have a strong , non  generic influence on the spectral statistics which causes deviations from the goe ",
    "predictions @xcite .",
    "there also exist quantum eigenstates , which are localized along the bouncing ball orbits ( the bouncing ball states ) , or along the boundary ( the whispering gallery states ) , in a much more pronounced way than the scars found along other periodic orbits .    as a consequence ,",
    "the stadium billiard is not an example of a hard chaos billiard , but may serve as an ideal model for systems exhibiting both regular and chaotic dynamics .",
    "though there is no stable island , the bouncing ball orbits act as the boundary of a torus enclosing an area with zero volume in phase space .",
    "this allows us to study pure boundary effects without dealing with the inner structure of the island .",
    "semiclassical results obtained for hard chaos systems suffer considerable changes when dealing with intermittency as will be shown here .",
    "first of all , the contributions of the marginal stable family to the trace of the green function need a special treatment @xcite .",
    "this is true , however , also for unstable periodic orbits close to the bouncing ball family .",
    "they can no longer be treated as isolated stationary phase points when approximating the trace of the green function at finite @xmath0 . as a consequence ,",
    "the gutzwiller periodic orbit formula is not valid for the dynamics in a whole phase space volume surrounding the marginal stable family .",
    "the size of this volume is explicitly @xmath0 dependent and shrinks to zero in the semiclassical limit .",
    "furthermore , standard semiclassical arguments referring to a cut  off in periodic orbit sums at a period given by the heisenberg time are not valid for intermittent systems .",
    "intermittency is related to a loss of internal time scales in the dynamics and infinitely long orbits thus contribute dominantly to the semiclassical zeta function at finite @xmath0 . in particular ,",
    "the regular bouncing ball states follow scaling laws for a cut  off in the orbit summation different from the estimate given by the berry  keating resummation technique @xcite . + the article is organized as follows : in section [ sec : bb ] , the contribution of the bouncing ball family to the trace of the green function is discussed .",
    "the derivation follows mainly the ideas developed in @xcite although here we do not deal with diffraction effects .",
    "it will be shown that the bouncing ball orbits give no contribution to individual eigenvalues of the stadium billiard . in section",
    "[ sec : t - oper ] , the bogomolny transfer operator method @xcite is introduced .",
    "a poincar surface of section is defined , which allows us to study the near bouncing ball dynamics , but explicitly excludes the bouncing ball family .",
    "the poincar map in the bouncing ball limit is derived , which allows us to obtain the leading contributions to the transfer operator for the bouncing ball spectrum .",
    "an approximate ebk ",
    "quantization of the bouncing ball states can be derived .",
    "an analysis of the trace of the transfer operator unveils the breakdown of the gutzwiller periodic orbit formula for unstable periodic orbits close to the bouncing ball family . in section [ sec : bbstates ] , we develop the concept of a `` semiclassical island of stability '' surrounding the marginally stable bouncing ball family in phase space and discuss the semiclassical limit of the bouncing ball spectrum .",
    "in this section , the bouncing ball contribution to the quantum spectral determinant @xmath5 is derived .",

    "@xcite , the green function for the quarter stadium billiard , fig .",
    "[ fig : stadium ] , is divided into a bouncing ball part and the rest , @xmath7 where @xmath8 .",
    "the bouncing ball contribution is restricted to @xmath9 , @xmath10 inside the rectangle and contains in semiclassical approximation all paths from @xmath9 to @xmath10 not reaching the circle boundary or bouncing off the vertical line in the rectangle .",
    "the classical paths correspond essentially to free motion , and the bouncing ball green function @xmath11 can be written as an infinite sum over hankel functions ( plus phases due to hard wall reflections ) .",
    "the trace then has the form @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the length of the rectangle , @xmath14 denotes the radius of the circle and @xmath15 is the hankel function of the first kind .",
    "the real part of the trace diverges due to the logarithmic singularity of the neumann function @xmath16 at the origin .",
    "this kind of divergence is a well known phenomenon for the trace of green functions and can be regularised e.g.  by defining @xmath17 $ ] for @xmath18 fixed @xcite .",
    "note , that the same regularisation techniques have to be applied for the true quantum trace @xmath19 and are thus not an artifact of the semiclassical approximation .",
    "we now move directly to the integrated trace , which reads @xmath20 and the asymptotic form of the hankel function has been used in the last step .",
    "the sum in ( [ inttrap ] ) is of the same kind as the contribution of a periodic orbit family in an integrable system ( here the rectangle ) as derived by berry and tabor @xcite .",
    "the real part of the non  oscillating contribution is a function of @xmath21 only , @xmath22 the real parameter @xmath23 originates from the regularisation and has the form @xmath24 the imaginary part is the bouncing ball contribution to the mean level staircase function @xmath25 the term @xmath26 is of the general form as derived in @xcite for arbitrary billiards with compact domain , i.e.   @xmath27 where @xmath28 corresponds to the volume of the billiard and @xmath23 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 are real constants .",
    "note , that the logarithmic singularity for @xmath31 in ( [ b2 g ] ) is absent in ( [ b2 ] ) .",

    " root cusps .",
    "the dominant oscillation introduced through the bouncing ball orbits is clearly visible in the oscillatory part of the level staircase function @xcite , and agrees with the prediction ( [ inttr ] ) .",
    "the bouncing ball part does , however , not contribute to individual eigenvalues .",
    "the spectral determinant ( [ specdet ] ) can be factorised according to @xmath37 and the bouncing ball contribution @xmath38 is a function which has no zeros in the whole complex @xmath32 plane .",
    "it gives rise to oscillations in the modulus of the spectral determinant with an amplitude growing like @xmath39 and a period @xmath40 , but it does not influence the individual zeros .",
    "the bouncing ball contributions to the spectral determinant can thus be divided out without losing information about the spectrum .",
    "this can be demonstrated by considering the boundary integral determinant @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the boundary integral kernel defined for @xmath9 and @xmath10 on the boundary of the billiard , ( for details see @xcite ) .",
    "the function @xmath43 has the same zeros as the exact spectral determinant @xmath44 , but may differ otherwise .",
    "especially , a smooth part @xmath45 is absent in the boundary integral determinant .",
    "this term originates from the zero length limit in the green function and is thus a pure volume effect .",
    "the modulation due to the bouncing ball contribution is clearly present in @xmath43 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : det]a .",
    "the large overall oscillation of the amplitude covers 7 order of magnitudes for @xmath46 but is completely removed by factorising out the bouncing ball part @xmath38 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : det]b . note , that the boundary integral determinant after factorization exhibits cusps at @xmath47 , and is thus non ",
    "analytic there .",
    "+ as a somewhat paradoxical result , we obtain that the bouncing ball family is responsible for strong modulations in the trace as well as in the spectral determinant .",
    "it does not , however , contribute to individual eigenvalues , and does not explain the regular modulation in the level spacing itself .",
    "the bouncing ball family covers a volume of measure zero in phase space , and is not sufficient to form a support for an eigenfunction alone .",
    "( this is of course true for any invariant family e.g.  in an integrable system . ) as a consequence , the neighborhood of the bouncing ball family in phase space must be responsible for the existence of the bouncing ball states and for the periodic change in the level spacings leading to the modulation in the level staircase function .",
    "the next section is devoted to a proper semiclassical analysis of the near bouncing ball dynamics .",
    "so far , it has been widely believed , that the remainder term in the trace of the green function ( [ green ] ) as well as in the spectral determinant ( [ specfak ] ) can in leading semiclassical approximation be described by the gutzwiller periodic orbit formula @xcite or equivalently by the semiclassical spectral determinant @xcite .",
    "this belief is confirmed by studies of the fourier transform of the ( smoothed ) quantum spectrum , which agrees reasonably well with periodic orbit predictions @xcite . the semiclassical expression for the determinant , valid for systems with unstable , isolated periodic orbits only , has the form @xmath48 the sum is taken here over all ( single repeats of ) periodic orbits of the system .",
    "the classical action @xmath49 is taken along the periodic orbit , and @xmath50 denotes the reduced monodromy matrix , which describes the linearized dynamics in phase space perpendicular to the periodic orbit on the energy manifold .",
    "the maslov index @xmath51 counts twice the full rotations of the ( real ) eigenvectors of @xmath50 around the orbit ( plus two times the number of hard wall reflections ) .",
    "the prefactors in front of the periodic orbit product are due to the zero - length limit in the green function in a similar way as derived in ( [ b2 ] ) , ( [ nmean ] ) and do not contribute to the spectrum .",
    "( [ detgut ] ) is formal in the sense , that it is not convergent for real energies @xcite and suitable resummation techniques have to be applied @xcite .",
    "thereby , the exponential function containing the periodic orbit sum is expanded and the resulting terms are regrouped by ordering them with respect to the total action or the total symbol length ( after choosing a suitable symbolic dynamics ) .",
    "such techniques have been shown to work successfully for hard chaos systems .    in the following",
    ", i will show that formula ( [ detgut ] ) is not valid for periodic orbits within a phase space region surrounding the bouncing ball family and will give explicit bounds for this area .",

    "periodic orbits appear as stationary phase points in the various traces and the amplitudes are recovered using the relation @xmath60 the stationary phase approximation demands periodic orbits to be unstable and sufficiently isolated .",
    "the last condition will be discussed in detail later .",
    "note that the determinant and the cumulant expansion ( [ cumexp ] ) are well defined only if the operator @xmath61 is _ trace class _ , which means essentially , that the trace of @xmath61 exists and is finite in any basis .",
    "( for further details see @xcite , other expansion methods using fredholm theory are discussed in @xcite ) .",
    "the bogomolny transfer matrix method has been shown to work satisfactorily for hard chaos @xcite , mixed @xcite as well as integrable @xcite systems , and has also been applied successfully to the stadium taking the billiard boundary as the poincar surface of section @xcite .",

    "an initial displacement is thus propagated according to @xmath151 where @xmath152 depends on the path of the underlying trajectory . for 2dimensional billiards , one obtains @xmath153 where @xmath154 denotes the time between two bounces at the boundary , @xmath91 is the length of the path and @xmath155 .",
    "the contribution from a reflection at the boundary is @xmath156 where @xmath157 denotes the local curvature of the boundary , and @xmath70 is the angle between the orbit and the normal to the boundary . the @xmath32  dependence is scale invariant due to the transformation @xmath158 , @xmath159 and we may set @xmath160 in what follows",
    ".    bounces on straight lines in the stadium billiard are treated as free flights .",
    "the angle of incidence @xmath70 is the same for all successive bounces of an orbit in the circle .",
    "the length between two of these bounces is @xmath161 where @xmath14 denotes the radius of the circle . the monodromy matrix for @xmath162 free flights in the circle interrupted by @xmath76 successive reflections on the circle boundary is thus given by @xmath163",
    "the whispering gallery limit of the poincar map ( [ pm ] ) is formed by trajectories @xmath164 with @xmath36 fixed and @xmath102 in the notation of section [ sec : classpm ] .",
    "these orbits approach the boundary of the billiard with an increasing number of bounces in the circle . only @xmath84 and @xmath165 is possible in the limit @xmath102 .",
    "i will consider here the case @xmath166 and @xmath167 .",
    "the approximate whispering gallery map for @xmath168 follows by analogy .",
    "there is one fixed point for each symbol pair @xmath169 with starting conditions @xmath170 the angle of incidence @xmath70 for reflections in the circle is @xmath171 the length of the corresponding periodic orbit approaches a constant , i.e.@xmath172 the monodromy matrix along the orbits starting on the poincar surface of section can be deduced from appendix [ app : a ] and is @xmath173 the periodic orbit weighting factor @xmath174 is thus @xmath175 the determinant and thus the largest eigenvalue @xmath176 of the monodromy matrix increase quadratically with the symbol index .",
    "the main difference compared to the bouncing ball limit is the convergence of the period @xmath177 towards a finite value : the length of the billiard boundary .",
    "the whispering gallery limit therefore introduces no intermittency .",
    "the liapunov  exponent of periodic orbits , @xmath178 diverges logarithmically and the boundary orbit @xmath179 is infinitely unstable .",
    "i will show below that the isolated orbit condition is again violated when taking the trace of the transfer operator .",
    "a naive summation of gutzwiller periodic orbit weights would overestimate the whispering gallery contributions considerably .",
    "the breakdown of the stationary phase condition is caused here by the accumulation of periodic orbits , i.e.  stationary phase points , near the billiard boundary .",
    "+ the phase space area of starting conditions on the poincar surface for trajectories with the same @xmath162value is centered on the corresponding periodic orbit .",
    "its size shrinks to zero in the limit @xmath102 both in the @xmath82 and @xmath74 coordinate .",
    "the transfer operator in the whispering gallery limit is thus directly given by the jacobian matrix ( [ mwg ] ) in local coordinates @xmath180 , @xmath181 centered on the fixed points ( [ powg ] ) .",
    "the orbit length is approximately given by the quadratic form @xmath182 with @xmath183 where @xmath177 denotes the length of the periodic orbit .",
    "when taking the trace of @xmath61 we are interested in trajectories satisfying @xmath184 which demands @xmath185 .",
    "more important is , however , the restrictions on the @xmath186  interval , i.e.@xmath187 the interval length and thus the integration range decreases like @xmath188 .",
    "the whispering gallery contribution to the trace of the @xmath61  operator are @xmath189 where the upper and lower limits in ( [ bwg ] ) have been approximated by their mean value @xmath190 the interval length decreases faster than ( the square root of ) the prefactor in the exponent for increasing @xmath162 .",
    "a stationary phase approximation is not justified for @xmath102 , and we obtain ( as in the bouncing ball limit ) a transition behavior @xmath191 note , that the number of periodic orbits which can be treated as isolated stationary phase points , increases only at a rate proportional to @xmath192 .",
    "the contributions for large @xmath162 fall off like @xmath188 and thus faster than in the bouncing ball case .",
    "in addition , there is a cancelation between the @xmath100 and the @xmath101 family which show the same overall behavior but appear with opposite signs .",
    "the whispering gallery contributions are thus small compared to near bouncing ball contributions , at least for @xmath193 .    99 m.  c.  gutzwiller , _ chaos in classical and quantum mechanics _",
