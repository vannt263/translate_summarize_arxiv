    "the phobos detector at rhic was designed to offer an overview of particle production in the collisions of a variety of systems ( p+p , d+au , au+au ) over a wide range of control parameters : beam energy , pseudorapidity , and centrality .",
    "the phobos apparatus was upgraded substantially for the 2003 d+au rhic run .",
    "two calorimeters ( pcal ) were added to provide information on spectator protons from the d and au projectiles .",
    "another major upgrade involved the phobos particle - identification system .",
    "the two time - of - flight ( tof ) walls were moved back from their design position to improve the mass resolution .",
    "time resolution was improved by the addition of two sets of 10 cerenkov timing start counters ( t0 ) .",
    "most importantly , two small hodoscopes were added just behind the phobos spectrometer to provide the means to trigger on high - momentum particles which also hit the tof walls . this spectrometer trigger ( spectrig )",
    "was installed to enrich the sample of identified particles at high transverse momentum ( @xmath17 gev / c ) .",
    "( integrated over @xmath18 ) divided by @xmath19 vs. @xmath0 .",
    "error bars are 90% c.l . while the grey band expresses the systematic error on @xmath0 in au+au .",

    "error bars are 90% c.l . while the grey band expresses the systematic error on @xmath0 in au+au .",
    "[ dauntot ] , width=302 ]    in 2003 , phobos took data at @xmath20 gev for both p+p and d+au collisions .",
    "minimum - bias d+au data has already been released @xcite . as with the d+au data ,",
    "the p+p data were corrected for trigger bias in an attempt to estimate the pseudorapidity distribution for the total inelastic cross section . using the signals in the phobos ring detectors ( @xmath21 )",
    ", the d+au data has been divided into centrality bins , which are shown in fig .",
    "[ daudndeta ] . as with au+au collisions , both limiting fragmentation relative to lower - energy proton - nucleus data @xcite , and participant scaling of the total multiplicity @xcite",
    "are observed , the latter being shown in fig .",
    "[ dauntot ] .",
    "these results are somewhat surprising since different dynamical effects could be expected to dominate in the deuteron and gold hemispheres , such as energy stopping and secondary cascading .",
    "the robustness of the @xmath0 scaling perhaps suggests some sort of long - range correlation among the produced particles .",
    "the different constant of proportionality between the p+p / d+au data and the au+au data also suggests a fundamental difference between the two , once moderate centralities are reached in au+au .",
    "these results , along with the detailed energy dependence of pseudorapidity distributions in p+a and d+a , are discussed in more detail in ref .",
    "as a function of @xmath22 for au+au collisions at three energies .",

    "[ v1eprime ] , height=226 ]    phobos results on @xmath23 as a function of pseudorapidity have been shown previously for data integrated over all available centralities @xcite .",
    "preliminary results have extended this measurement by a division of the data into three centrality bins , shown in fig .",
    "[ v2cent ] .",
    "these results show that the shape is manifestly not boost invariant over all @xmath4 in peripheral collisions ( although one must not ignore kinematic effects near midrapidity , as pointed out by kolb @xcite ) . moreover ,",
    "the shape does not change dramatically as a function of centrality , apart from an overall scale factor .",
    "new at qm2004 are results on @xmath24 , the first harmonic of the azimuthal angular distribution , as a function of pseudorapidity and beam energy .",
    "a simple picture , which considers the effect of the net baryons , would suggest that @xmath24 should develop opposite signs for baryons and mesons , with the baryons defined to have a positive directed flow signal near projectile rapidities .",
    "our results on @xmath24 show a striking energy dependence , which leads to a large range in @xmath4 with @xmath25 for the higher energies and then a small but systematic negative @xmath24 that is approximately independent of energy when viewed relative to beam rapidity , shown in fig .",
    "[ v1eprime ] .",
    "this may be apparently another manifestation of `` limiting fragmentation '' , already seen in the pseudorapidity distributions of charged particles @xcite .",
    "studies such as these should be useful in understanding the global dynamics of au+au collisions .",
    "these results , along with comparisons to other experimental data , are explained in more detail in ref .",
    "vs. @xmath4 for a bin width of @xmath26 .",
    "[ sigmac ] , width=264 ]     vs. @xmath4 for a bin width of @xmath26 .",
    "[ sigmac ] , height=264 ]    another approach to understanding the role of correlations in rapidity space is the use of multi - particle correlation measures like two - particle hbt correlations and forward - backward correlations .",
    "phobos has performed the first measurement of the rapidity dependence of hbt correlations at rhic . using the ykp ( yano - koonin - podgoretskii ) parametrization , we have also been able to correlate the rapidity of the local source as a function of the average rapidities of the two particles .",
    "shown in fig .",
    "[ yykp ] , one sees that these two rapidities are tightly correlated , suggesting that particles produced at a certain rapidity were produced by a source moving collectively at the same rapidity .",
    "this result is similar that found by the na49 experiment at the sps .",
    "these results are explained in more detail in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "another indication that multiparticle correlations reflect physics local in rapidity comes from the measurement of forward - backward correlations .",
    "one would expect a strong correlation between particles produced in rapidity bins in opposite hemispheres , simply from the fact that particle production is controlled by the number of participants .",
    "the quantitative analysis of relative fluctuations can be used to assess the level of short range correlations , which should lead to a non - binomial distribution of multiplicities between two identical bins in the forward ( @xmath27 ) and backward ( @xmath28 ) directions . by analyzing the variance of a variable @xmath29 , @xmath30 , as a function of the total multiplicity @xmath31 , compared to a detailed monte carlo simulation of our apparatus",
    ", we can study non - binomial contributions to the fluctuations . in fig .",
    "[ sigmac ] , we show data on @xmath30 for a bin width @xmath32 vs. @xmath4 as open squares",
    ". results from hijing events are shown for primary charged particles ( closed circles ) and full simulations ( open circles ) .",
    "the deviations of @xmath30 for the primary charged particles from unity indicate that short - range correlations exist with a mild pseudorapidity dependence for @xmath33 .",
    "the agreement of the data with the fully - simulated hijing suggests similar correlations are present in our data set .",

    "[ ratiosvspt ] , width=226 ]",
    "one of the major upgrades to the phobos detector in 2003 was the rearrangement of the tof walls and the addition of a trigger to increase our statistics of events with a high - momentum track in the spectrometer . with the enriched data set , we were able to make several new measurements of identified particles at high @xmath36 in d+au collisions .",
    "these results are explained in more detail in ref .",
    ".    ratios of identified particles and anti - particles are a tool to study baryon transport .",
    "various models predict a substantial transport of the initial baryon number of the deuteron all the way to mid - rapidity , leading to a progressive decrease in the @xmath37 ratio as a function of the number of collisions of each deuteron participant ( characterized by @xmath38 ) @xcite .",
    "our results for this ratio using @xmath39 pid , shown in fig .",
    "[ ratiosvsnu ] , show surprisingly little centrality dependence for particle momenta below 1 gev / c and essentially the same result is found in p+p and d+au . using the tof to extend our particle identification from 1.75 gev / c to 3 gev / c",
    ", this ratio shows a similarly weak centrality dependence .",
    "moreover , this ratio is also weakly dependent on @xmath36 , as seen in fig .",
    "[ ratiosvspt ] .",
    "this suggests that proton and anti - proton spectra are similar , except for a difference in overall yield .",
    "the increased statistics in the spectrometer has enabled phobos to measure spectra of identified pions , kaons , and protons of both charge signs up to 3.5 gev .",
    "the presence of a `` cronin effect '' in d+au collisions at rhic energies has raised the question of whether any particular species is responsible for this effect .",
    "we have found that the relative contributions to the inclusive spectra vary substantially with @xmath36 , especially the growing fraction of protons and anti - protons , as shown by the invariant yields plotted vs. @xmath36 in fig .",
    "[ pt_mt_pos ] . however , when the yields are shown as a function of @xmath2 , the relative contributions appear to have little @xmath2-dependence . in other words ,",
    "an apparent @xmath2 scaling is evident in the @xmath40 data .",
    "this is also seen in @xmath41 data , but is dramatically violated at low momentum in au+au @xcite .",
    "( left ) and @xmath2 ( right ) .",
    "the open and closed symbols represent two different bending directions .",
    "the data are not corrected for contributions from weak decays .",
    "statistical errors are shown as bars .",
    "systematic errors are indicated by brackets .",
    "[ pt_mt_pos],height=226 ]",
    "one of the more striking results from the 2003 data is the observation of a significant @xmath4 dependence in the modification of @xmath40 spectra relative to @xmath41 data @xcite .",
    "this has been interpreted as an indication of the onset of parton saturation @xcite in the forward region . to address this topic ,",
    "phobos has repeated its measurement of @xmath3 , originally integrated over our full acceptance ( @xmath42 ) @xcite , but now in three bins ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 ) . even within the acceptance of the phobos spectrometer , @xmath46 units , a dramatic drop in this ratio is seen as a function of @xmath4 . when compared with other results from rhic in fig .",
    "[ rdauvseta ] , it is found that the suppression seen at forward rapidities is a continuation of a trend started already at midrapidity .",
    "measurements in the backward hemisphere by phenix show a clear enhancement of pion production with @xmath47 gev / c @xcite , suggesting that this is not an effect that `` turns on '' in the forward region , but rather part of a difference between @xmath41 and @xmath40 data that extends over a large range in @xmath4 .     at fixed values of @xmath36 shown as a function of @xmath4 , compared with results from other rhic experiments .",
    "error bars are statistical only .",
    "[ rdauvseta ] , height=264 ]",
    "recent p+p , d+au , and au+au results at 200 gev from the phobos experiment at rhic have been presented .",
