    "we have constructed numerical solutions using the conventional level truncation method in the theory of @xmath27 obtained by expanding the string field around an identity - based marginal solution , which has one parameter , @xmath3 : + ( a ) we have constructed tachyon vacuum solutions in the siegel gauge and the landau gauge . with increasing level , the values of the action at the solutions approach a d - brane tension in the wider range of the parameter @xmath3 .",

    "as the truncation level is increased , the vacuum energy @xmath86 of @xmath82 , which is normalized by a d - brane tension , seems to become @xmath87 for _ any _ value of @xmath3 , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : sx ] . actually , this can be justified as follows . without level truncation",

    ", we find that the value of the action ( [ sphi ] ) does not depend on @xmath3 , namely , @xmath210=s[\\phi_0]$ ] .",
    "additionally , it is well confirmed that the normalized vacuum energy of @xmath170 should be @xmath87 using the level truncation method . in a similar manner , we can justify our numerical evidence of @xmath106 and @xmath211 in  [ sec : egio ] : without the level truncation , we can show that @xmath212 and @xmath213 using explicit expression of the gauge invariant overlap .",
