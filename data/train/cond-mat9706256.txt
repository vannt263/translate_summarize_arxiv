    "recently , there has been a considerable surge of interest in the electronic properties of nanometric - scale metal and semiconductor structures @xcite .",
    "static as well as transport properties of these systems can be obtained from the knowledge of the statistics of the energy level distribution for quantum - mechanical structures in which weak disorder ( or quantum chaos ) plays a fundamental role .",
    "the presence of an external magnetic field enhances the influence of the quantum fluctuations on the properties of these mesoscopic systems .",
    "the remarkable advances in nanostructure fabrication procedures have also lead recently to a good deal of experimental and theoretical studies of the properties of quantum dots , quantum wires and , moreover , of quantum dot arrays ( qda ) @xcite which can be obtained by a variety of techniques at semiconductor surfaces and interfaces .",
    "all these mesoscopic structures exhibit a wealth of new interesting quantum phenomena in an external magnetic field and at low temperatures .",
    "in particular , qda ( as `` artificial crystals '' ) offer the possibility of investigating situations not accessible in natural crystals for the magnetic fields that can be produced in normal laboratory conditions .    on the other hand ,",
    "a most celebrated quantum phenomenon , occurring at low temperatures in the presence of a magnetic field and assisted by the presence of weak disorder in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) semiconductor heterostructure , is the integer quantum hall effect ( iqhe ) @xcite .",
    "the plateaux in the hall conductivity are believed to be the result of current - carrying edge states and localized bulk states @xcite .",
    "the transitions between plateaux are due to localization - delocalization transitions induced by the combined effects of the magnetic field and disorder close to zero absolute temperature @xcite .",
    "the behaviour near a single iqhe transition ( qht ) can be described in a number of ways , theoretically , in order to reproduce the jump in the conductivity and other singularities near the qht .",
    "a model for the iqhe that is particularly suited to the present work has been proposed and studied by ludwig et al .",
    "@xcite . in this model ,",
    "a square lattice hopping model is defined , with a fixed half - flux - quantum @xmath0 per plaquette defining the lattice spacing @xmath1 , with both nearest - neighbour and next - nearest - neighbour hopping processes considered in the presence of a staggered chemical potential and suitable forms of the one - particle disordered potential . in the continuum limit , @xmath2 formally , and near the qht this model yields a valid description of the behaviour near a single iqhe step @xcite .",
    "it would seem natural , therefore , to extend the model of ludwig et al . to the description of the qht in a qda system .",
    "this has indeed been done @xcite , by taking into account the fluctuations of the quantum levels pertinent to a single quantum dot .",
    "the existence of a supporting lattice in the qda also makes the model of ludwig et al .",
    ", as extended and studied by ziegler @xcite , physically more appealing . in this model",
    "a qht is indeed found and described in the proximity of the transition point .",
    "it is found that the otherwise sharp qht step becomes rounded by the presence of level - fluctuations in the single - dots .    in this paper",
    "we present an analytical characterization of the fluctuations of the local density of states ( dos ) for a qda near the qht , using the model and calculations presented in @xcite .",
    "our calculation is interesting in its own right for a good number of reasons .",
    "first and foremost , the averaged dos and the moments of its distribution due to level statistics can be studied by means of knight shift nmr measurements , now becoming accessible for semiconductor heterostructures @xcite .",
    "another candidate technique for measuring local dos - related properties is the single - electron tunneling ( set ) @xcite , which provides an imaging of the local dos in ( bulk ) semiconductors .",
    "a more detailed discussion will be presented in the conclusions , section iv . also , from the more theoretical point of view",
    ", it is of interest to characterise the fluctuations near the qht of an observable quantity like the dos , considering that in the absence of fluctuations in the levels of a dot the dos itself vanishes at the centre of the band , @xmath3 .",
    "when fluctuations are present , a semi - circle law is obtained for the averaged local dos @xmath4 which does not vanish anymore at @xmath3 .",
    "the second moment of the global dos vanishes identically , but not that of the local dos    @xmath5    which we calculate in this work .",
    "here , @xmath6 plays the role of a chemical potential which controls the density of fermions in the system ( for details see section ii ) .",
    "we find that @xmath7 diverges near the point @xmath8 where @xmath9 vanishes , indicating that the level - fluctuations are particularly strong near this value of the energy . from the technical point of view",
    ", our work represents an attempt to characterise quantum mesoscopic fluctuations in a system of dimensionality @xmath10 without applying the @xmath11 expansion technique .",
    "most approximate methods in fact deal with @xmath12 systems in the end ( e.g. single dots , or aggregates of small metallic particles ) and more rigorous and/or numerical work has been done chiefly for one - dimensional systems . an alternative approach to random electronic systems remains , naturally , the above - mentioned @xmath11 expansion technique @xcite , which however applies only to the scaling regime near the mobility edge .",
    "therefore , our contribution to this field is instrumental for extending theoretical research to systems of dimensionality @xmath13 , as our calculations can indeed be implemented , with some additional computational effort , for the characterisation of the higher moments of the local dos , as well as of those for the conductivity . as a further remark , we point out that the straight quantum hall system can be viewed as a mesoscopic - like system itself in terms of the recently - discovered @xcite universal conductance fluctuations between quantum hall plateaux near the qht .",
    "this indicates , as confirmed by very recent numerical studies @xcite , that the characterization of the electronic states in the presence of level fluctuations for 2d electron - gas systems is of interest even before the complications of a periodic qda structure are inserted in these devices .",
    "the article is organised as follows . in section",
    "ii we define the details of the model and justify its applicability to the qda system in the close proximity of the qht .",
    "this is a model for quasiparticles ( quasielectrons ) in a lattice of `` artificial atoms '' ( the qda ) ; the quasiparticle levels are subject to some statistics with strong correlations of universal nature and characterized by a wigner - dyson distribution @xcite . the model is set up with a fixed flux @xmath0 per plaquette , but although this may imply a fixed value of the magnetic field we stress that the presence of a ( staggered ) chemical potential @xmath14 allows one to tune the model in the close vicinity of a qht .",
    "the model includes a random potential , and we take the point of view that a random ( dirac ) mass for the electrons is adequate in capturing the physics of the level fluctuations inside a single quantum dot . in section",
    "iii we briefly discuss the functional integral representation for the appropriate products of green functions , following standard procedures @xcite .",
    "we set up a representation in terms of superfields ( bosonic as well as fermionic ) to take care of the averaging over level fluctuations , and carry out a large-@xmath15 saddle - point approximation to evaluate the first and second moments of the local dos near the qht .",
    "this is a justified approximation when @xmath16 represents the number of single quantum dot levels , but the case @xmath17 , representing the straight quantum hall system , can in principle also be described by this approximation .",
    "we carry out the analysis for the gaussian fluctuations and present our results .",
    "these are discussed in the conclusions , section iv , where the connection with some other recent papers on the subject is established , as is the connection between our results and their possible experimental verification by means of nmr knight shift or set measurements .",
    "a 2d array of quantum dots in a homogeneous perpendicular magnetic field can be modelled by a tight - binding tunneling ( or hopping ) hamiltonian which , neglecting quasiparticle - interactions , takes the quadratic form @xmath18 , with @xmath19 creating a quasielectron at qda site @xmath20 in single - dot level @xmath21 .",
    "the matrix elements @xmath22 are chosen as @xcite    @xmath23    here we take the point of view that the single - dot electronic states are statistically distributed with matrix - elements @xmath24 defined by the gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue ) statistics : @xmath25 , @xmath26 being the strength of the level fluctuations depending on the nature of the interactions and/or disorder and chaos inside a single dot .",
    "we take , at least initially , the point of view that weak tunneling processes take place between neighbouring dots and within the same single - dot energy levels .",
    "strictly - speaking our formulation already contains tunneling between different neighbouring dots energy levels via the random occupation of levels pertinent to each individual dot . here",
    ", tunneling diagonal in the level indices will be assumed as realistic for the actual calculations and we take the tunneling rates to be non - vanishing only between nearest - neighbouring and next - nearest - neighbouring dots .",
    "these rates take into account the presence of a magnetic field that can be thought of as fixed at the value @xmath27 , in correspondence with the spacing @xmath1 ( typically @xcite one has @xmath28 to 500 nm ) between the dots . in the landau gauge ,",
    "the tunneling hamiltonian matrix elements read ( setting @xmath29 and indicating with @xmath30 and @xmath31 the lattice unit vectors ) :    @xmath32    finally , the potential @xmath33 represents an additional ( e.g. electric ) external field and can be regarded as a staggered chemical potential : @xmath34 , which opens a gap @xmath35 in the spectrum of the quasielectrons .",
    "for the `` simple '' iqhe situation , the model reduces to its @xmath17 limit and corresponds to the model proposed for the qht by ludwig et al .",
    "we assume for the qda that the separation @xmath1 between the dots is much greater than the dots size .",
    "now , following a standard procedure @xcite , the model ( [ lattmodel ] ) is reduced in the continuum limit ( formally @xmath36 ) and for long wavelengths to an equivalent 2d dirac hamiltonian @xcite    @xmath37    @xmath38 is here the 2d ( lattice ) gradient operator , @xmath39 are pauli matrices and @xmath40 is a random mass matrix with mean @xmath41 : @xmath42 with @xmath43 . the tunneling rate @xmath44 is scaled out in the hamiltonian .",
    "therefore , @xmath6 is measured in units of @xmath44 and the fluctuation parameter @xmath26 is measured in units of @xmath45 . this model , for @xmath17 and within a saddle - point approximation",
    ", describes the jump in the conductivity characterising the qht and displays for the local dos a characteristic semi - circle law @xcite .",
    "the transition is driven either by changing the external field or , equivalently , as will be argued in this work , by changing the chemical potential @xmath14 .    in principle",
    "there can be three different types of randomness : a random dirac mass , a random energy and a random vector potential .",
    "we believe , however , that the random mass alone correctly accounts for the effects of the level - fluctuations in the single quantum dots .",
    "the random vector potential does not break the time reversal symmetry of the massless dirac fermions .",
    "this is a strong restriction which implies that the case of the massless model has very special properties @xcite .",
    "most remarkable is the fact that the average dos is singular and obeys a power law : @xmath46 with @xmath47 .",
    "this is an unphysical behaviour because the dos should be finite at the hall transition . a finite dos exists for a random dirac mass @xcite and for a random energy term @xcite .",
    "( ludwig et al .",
    "@xcite obtained for a random dirac mass the result of a vanishing dos at the hall transition , using a perturbative renormalization group calculation .",
    "consequently , they argued that only a combination of a random mass _ and _ a random vector potential can lead to a non - zero dos .",
    "however , a non - perturbative approach gives a non - zero dos already for a random dirac mass @xcite , proportional to @xmath48 . )",
    "the random dirac mass creates spontaneously a contribution proportional to the random energy ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and section iii.a of this article ) .",
    "this implies that including the random energy will not lead to a qualitative change of the effect of the random dirac mass .",
    "results from previous calculations with this model will be recalled below ; here it suffices to notice that the green s function @xmath49 has special properties because of the lorentz invariance of the dirac theory .",
    "in particular we will make use in the following of the relation @xmath50 . here , and in the following , @xmath51 is a convenient notation @xcite for the 2@xmath522 unit matrix .    as a last remark about the model , we now clarify the role of the `` fixed '' magnetic flux per plaquette .",
    "the physical parameter of the model is not the magnetic flux , but the filling factor @xmath53 ( @xmath54 is here the density of particles , @xmath55 the external magnetic field ) .",
    "@xmath54 can be written as the total number of particles divided by the total area of the system .",
    "since the particles are non - interacting fermions , there are at most @xmath15 particles , if @xmath15 is the number of lattice sites .",
    "the local dos is symmetric around @xmath56 .",
    "this implies that there are @xmath57 particles at @xmath56 . on the other hand",
    ", the lattice can be divided into plaquettes of four lattice sites each .",
    "the flux through each plaquette is @xmath58 , if @xmath59 is the area of the plaquette .",
    "taking into account that there are @xmath15 plaquettes ( in the thermodynamic limit , when boundary effects can be ignored ) , we can write for the filling factor    @xmath60    hence , the filling factor is 1 , regardless of all other model parameters .",
    "according to standard green s function theory , the local dos ( ldos ) is obtained from    @xmath61= \\frac{i}{2\\pi } \\big[g_{11,rr}^{\\alpha\\alpha}+g_{22,rr}^{\\alpha\\alpha } -(g_{11,rr}^{\\alpha\\alpha})^*-(g_{22,rr}^{\\alpha\\alpha})^*\\big].\\ ] ]    for the tight - binding model without magnetic field this implies that one has to evaluate the two - particle green s function with opposite signs of the frequency ( advanced and retarded green s functions ) in order to get the second moment of the ldos @xcite .",
    "this is the same problem as in the evaluation of the conductivity . in the model with half a flux quantum per plaquette , however , we can use the relation @xmath62 to write    @xmath63    and consequently    @xmath64    in this way we set out to evaluate    @xmath65 .",

    "by means of a standard representation , we write , quite generally @xcite    @xmath66    and consequently    @xmath67    with the supersymmetric action ( sum convention for @xmath68 )    @xmath69,\\ ] ]    where @xmath70 and the field @xmath71 .",
    "the first component is grassmann and the second complex .",
    "we notice that the normalization of the functional integral in ( [ corr ] ) is due to the combination of grassmann and complex fields . averaging with gaussian distributed fluctuations in the `` masses '' @xmath72 yields @xmath73 , with    @xmath74",
    "thus we have derived an effective field theory for @xmath75 which serves as a generating functional for the averaged green s function .",
    "it is important to notice that _ not only _",
    "@xmath76 creates the fermion - fermion interaction in ( [ quartact ] ) but that also other types of randomness can do this job . for instance , the interaction can also be created by a term which couples to a matrix field ( @xmath77 includes the complex and grassmann components ) :    @xmath78=\\int\\exp\\big[-(n / g)\\sum { \\hat q}_{r;\\mu,\\mu ' } ( \\sigma_3)_{\\mu'}{\\hat q}_{r;\\mu',\\mu}(\\sigma_3)_{\\mu } -i\\sum { \\hat q}_{r;\\mu,\\mu'}\\phi_{r,\\mu'}^{\\alpha}{\\bar\\phi}_{r,\\mu}^{\\alpha } \\big]{\\cal d}[{\\hat q}],\\ ] ]    with the supermatrix    @xmath79    the field @xmath75 appears only in a quadratic form on the right hand side .",

    "there is both a trivial and a nontrivial solution , @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "the latter is possible for @xmath99 with @xmath100 .",
    "this means the level fluctuations shift the energy @xmath101 and the dirac mass @xmath102 , where @xmath103 and @xmath104 are solutions of the sp equations ( [ spe ] ) .",
    "the sign of @xmath105 is fixed by the condition that @xmath105 must be analytic in @xmath106 ; this leads to @xmath107 .",
    "it is important to notice that @xmath105 is proportional to the energy and _ not _ to the mass .",
    "that means , the random dirac mass creates spontaneously a contribution which would be expected from a random energy term .",
    "this fact indicates that an additional random energy term may not qualitatively change the properties of the random dirac mass .",
    "the average local dos can now be directly calculated from ( [ ldos ] ) in spa    @xmath108    where @xmath109 is the heaviside step function .",
    "we see that a semi - circle law is reproduced . in the following",
    "we will consider only the regime where the average local dos is nonzero , i.e. , @xmath110 .      in order to evaluate the second moment of the local dos",
    "the gaussian fluctuations around the sp must be calculated . since @xmath111 , @xmath91 and @xmath112 are @xmath113 matrices , the fluctuations can also be parametrised as 4-component vector fields : @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 with analogous definitions for @xmath118 and the grassmann field @xmath119 with @xmath120 and @xmath121",

    "there is a narrow band of bulk electronic states .",
    "moreover , there are also edge states which carry the hall current for @xmath161 . in the following",

    "these results , obtained for a realistic lattice of `` artificial atoms '' , have not been discussed before ( but see , however , below ) . the data in fig",
    ". 1 show quite clearly the presence of important fluctuations in the local dos as a consequence of single - dot level fluctuations , the fluctuations becoming perhaps critical at the edge of the band .",
    "the level fluctuations for an isolated quantum dot are described by a single random matrix @xmath166 which remains from the hamiltonian of eq.([diracham ] ) .",
    "the random matrix has , in contrast to the full hamiltonian ( [ diracham ] ) , a continuous unitary symmetry .",
    "this generates in the @xmath89 limit a saddle point manifold which we have to integrate out .",
    "the remaining functional is a zero - dimensional nonlinear sigma model @xcite for the evaluation of the fluctuations of the dos .",
    "the cross - over from the fully coupled quantum dots to isolated dots can be achieved by decreasing the tunneling rates @xmath44 and @xmath167 .",
    "since @xmath44 was scaled out in the hamiltonian , we must study for this purpose the rescaled mass @xmath168 and the rescaled disorder parameter @xmath169 .",
    "sending @xmath170 , @xmath171 goes like @xmath172 .",
    "therefore , the level fluctuations create a broad `` band '' which is surpressed by the tunneling term to a much narrower band .",
    "moreover , the fluctuations of the local dos are also reduced by the tunneling between the quantum dots .",
    "notice that the strength of the fluctuations in the local dos depends on the parameter @xmath160 .",
    "this requires tuning the value of the chemical potential @xmath14 or of the next - near - neighbour hopping @xmath167 .",
    "both could be achieved in experimentally realizable qda by means of a varying gate voltage or a suitable design in the gate structure and in its voltages .",
    "it is important to discuss , at this point , the relevance of our calculation for perspective experimental observations on qda . to our knowledge the local dos can be accessed experimentally by two possibilities : the knight shift of the nmr ( nuclear magnetic resonance ) lineshape due to the electron polarization @xcite and the set ( single electron tunneling ) technique @xcite . from these measurements",
    "one can gain access to the statistics of the local dos mesoscopic fluctuations .",
    "we begin by discussing the nmr knight shift technique , which has recently witnessed considerable revival both for mesoscopic semiconductor structures and for high - temperature superconductors . for zero - dimensional mesoscopic structures ( single dots , small metallic particles or random aggregates of these ) the knight shift method has been discussed by efetov and prigodin @xcite and by falko and efetov @xcite . for the one - dimensional disordered metal a related discussion for the connection between the local dos and the knight shift",
    "can be found in the work of altshuler and prigodin @xcite .",
    "here we give a formulation for the knight shift in a 2d qda .",
    "we adapt the treatment for the knight shift in a traditional solid ( like , e.g. li ) @xcite to the situation in which a ( 2d ) solid of `` artificial atoms '' is considered .",
    "assume that a tight - binding description of quasielectron tunneling ( or hopping ) is appropriate ( as advocated in the calculation of the previous sections ) and that a single - dot confining potential approximately of the square - well type can be used to describe the single `` atomic '' levels @xmath173 of a single dot .",
    "then a `` band - structure '' approach becomes a realistic calculation of the energy levels of the entire 2d qda made up of these `` atoms '' and we can envisage the creation of `` bands '' of energy states from each `` atomic '' level @xmath174 .",
    "we label the 2d qda energy levels , therefore , @xmath175 and these will normally overlap due to the closeness of the levels @xmath174 of the single - dots . by building the many - electron wave - function in the normal way , the hyperfine interaction hamiltonian can be averaged over the electronic degrees of freedom to give the contribution to the nuclear hamiltonian arising from the electron polarization in the qda that ultimately leads to the knight shift formula      at the nuclear site @xmath177 . in the above formula , beside the local dos which is the subject of the present investigation , appear also the single - dot wavefunction @xmath178 ( averaged over an equal - energy surface ) and the electron spin susceptibility      where the approximation holds at low temperatures ( where the fermi distribution function @xmath180 can be expanded ) .",
    "since the low - temperature form of @xmath181 is delta - like , we essentially get that the knight shift is proportional to the local dos , evaluated at the fermi level , however through a multiplicative constant that is in principle also randomly distributed , in a way that is beyond the scope of the present treatment .",
    "we conclude with the form      for the expected knight shift from a qda .",
    "if we assume that the wavefunction at the fermi level has much smaller fluctuations than the local dos , then the moments of the local dos can be extracted by looking at the moments of the knight shift itself .",
    "set spectroscopy is well - known as a tool for the investigation of discrete single- and few - electron energy states in quantum dots @xcite .",
    "lerner and raikh @xcite have proposed to apply the technique to study the weak - localization effects in disordered heterostructures , and the use of set spectroscopy for imaging the local dos in a disordered ( bulk ) semiconductor heterostructure has been recently reported @xcite .",
    "thus , set spectroscopy appears to be a promising tool for an experimental investigation of local dos fluctuations in a qda .        with @xmath186 , @xmath157 and @xmath187 geometrical parameters .",
    "a more complicated treatment ensues for a disordered material in the junction s barrier .",
    "the conductance presents mesoscopic fluctuations at low temperatures and one can show @xcite that the second moments of local dos and conductance are related by the formula          for the _ local _ fluctuations of the conductance @xmath191 of the disordered sample .",
    "thus , set spectroscopy can provide information , in principle , to local dos statistical properties perhaps also in the case of a qda setup .",
    "we mention , before concluding this subsection , the possibility of imaging the local dos for surface electronic states also by means of scanning - tunneling microscopy ( stm ) @xcite .",
    "this technique also relies on the measurement of the differential conductance , @xmath192 , at local sample s sites ; from this , the shape of the local dos and its fluctuations statistics can be reconstructed .",
    "this technique is perhaps more suitable for 2d systems like our qda .    whether from the knight shift in nmr or from the conductance in set experiments ,",
    "the measurement of the value of the local dos in a real qda should allow ( via , e.g. repeated measurements ) for a statistics of its fluctuations and the experimental determination of @xmath7 .",
    "this will be an indirect observation of the existence of level - fluctuations in single quantum dots .      in dimensions higher than @xmath194 ,",
    "there already exist calculations of the second moment of the local dos for the situation in which randomness creates a mobility edge in the anderson transition for a disordered metal @xcite .",
    "these calculations are based on @xmath11 type expansions on the @xmath111-matrix non - linear @xmath195 model and lead to the result that @xmath196 with @xmath197 .",
    "this shows the existence of the possibility of a divergence for the second moment of the local dos near the mobility edge .",
    "although the anderson transition situation is not exactly the same qda problem treated in the present paper , nevertheless these calculations show that a divergence of @xmath7 is to be expected .    in lower dimensions , we recall the work of altshuler and prigodin , for @xmath198 @xcite , and of efetov and prigodin , for @xmath199 @xcite ( a single dot in our picture ) , for the case of a disordered metal . in @xmath198 , exact diagrammatic techniques can be employed to work out the entire probability distribution for the local dos of a weakly disordered metal .",
    "the resulting distribution depends strongly on the type ( open or closed ) of boundary conditions . finally , in @xmath199 the non - linear-@xmath195-model calculations involving supersymmetry of ref .",
    "@xcite can be employed .",
    "we have shown how , by means of the technique of dirac fermions in @xmath194 , one can characterize the distribution of the fluctuations of the local dos in the proximity of an iqhe transition .",
    "we have restricted the calculation to characterize the second moment @xmath200 , but in principle also the higher moments can be evaluated ( with increasing technical difficulties ) .",
    "we have made extensive use of the fact that in the dirac fermions approach one is dealing with a unique saddle point solution , unlike in the case of the non - linear-@xmath195-model approach .",
    "this is a consequence of the discrete symmetry of the model of ludwig et al .",
    "@xcite for the case of a random mass , which we use for our calculations .",
    "this simple structure of the saddle point solution made the 2d calculation possible .",
