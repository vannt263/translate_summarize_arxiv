    "electromagnetic radiation arising from charged particle motion at scales outside the quantum - mechanical limit can be described completely from maxwell s equations and the distribution of charges and their accelerations .",
    "most university courses begin with these fundamental relations , proceed to intermediate results such as the linard - wiechert potentials and/or the larmor formula for the power radiated from an accelerated charge , and use these to derive the properties of classical named radiation processes such as synchrotron , transition , and vavilov - cherenkov radiation where an ( at least semi- ) analytic solution can be found .",
    "this approach leads to a greater understanding of both radiation phenomenology , such as relativistic beaming , and of those physical situations where the rather special assumptions on the particle motion required to find an analytic solution apply .",
    "the focus on classical named radiation processes however can leave the impression that these are the fundamental mechanisms of electromagnetically radiating systems , whereas they are really short - hand for a type of charged particle acceleration which results in a particular radiation field .",
    "because of this focus , there is a tendency among physicists to ascribe the radiation from complex systems to a combination of these classical processes .",
    "this tendency can lead to confusion however even when a physical situation deviates only slightly from the classical idealised cases .",
    "for instance , consider the titles of the following papers : `` synchrotron radiation of charged particles passing through the boundary between two media '' @xcite , `` on the erenkov threshold associated with synchrotron radiation in a dielectric medium '' @xcite , and `` erenkov radiation from an electron traveling in a circle through a dielectric medium '' @xcite .",
    "the titles could equally have referred to ` transition radiation ' , ` vavilov - cherenkov radiation ' , and ` synchrotron radiation ' respectively . indeed ,",
    "numerous papers exist which note that the same fundamental physics can explain multiple mechanisms , for instance schwinger , tsai and erber s `` classical and quantum theory of synergic synchrotron - erenkov radiation '' @xcite .",
    "however , the problem of which mechanism to attribute to what process can be avoided entirely by going ` back to basics ' and formulating a general description of radiation processes according to the well - known mantra `` electromagnetic radiation comes from accelerated charges '' .",
    "the goal of this paper is therefore to develop a new methodology  the ` endpoint formulation '  by which the calculation of the radiated fields from accelerated particles can be performed completely generally via a method which is intuitively understandable at an undergraduate level . for generality , our formulation must be equally suited to that of a simple system allowing an analytic solution as to a complex one requiring a numerical solution , and allow not just the calculation of the total radiated power , but also the time- and frequency - dependent electric field strengths .",
    "we thus proceed as follows . in section [ endpoint_derivation ] , we begin with expressions for the electric field from the well - known linard - wiechert potentials , and use these to develop our formulation , which is based on the radiation from the instantaneous acceleration of a particle from / to rest ( an ` endpoint ' ) . given the radiation from a single endpoint , we describe how to use this to calculate the radiation from an arbitrary complex physical situation . in section",
    "[ compare ] , we use the endpoint formulation in specific applications to numerically reproduce the well - known results from idealised classical phenomena such as synchrotron and transition radiation , and tamm s description of vavilov - cherenkov radiation from finite particle tracks .",
    "section [ discussion ] discusses the use and range of applicability of our endpoint formulation . in section [ applications ] , we return to the original motivation for this work from the point of view of the authors , and demonstrate how this formulation resolves outstanding questions relating to the calculation of radiation from high - energy particles cascades in the moon and the earth s atmosphere .",
    "the explanations also serve to illustrate how the application of classical radiation emission mechanisms to complex physical situations has led to incorrect and misunderstood conclusions .",
    "we wish to describe electromagnetic radiation in terms of particle acceleration . rather than writing down a general function for the charged particle distribution and its time derivatives , and then deriving results for specific cases of that charge distribution , here we adopt a ` bottom - up ' approach .",
    "thus we begin by describing the radiation from a simple single radiating unit , that being the instantaneous acceleration of a charged particle either to or from rest , and later we will show how to combine such basic units into more complex physical situations .",
    "radiation from an instantaneous particle acceleration is known best through larmor s formula and its relativistic generalisation , which gives the total power radiated per unit frequency and solid angle . in the interest of clarity , and because we wish to preserve phase information , we proceed below to re - derive the emitted radiation in terms of the electric - field in the time- and frequency - domains . by beginning with the linard - wiechert potentials only",
    ", we hope to emphasise the generality of our result .",
    "electric field components due to particle motion and acceleration can be readily separated using the linard - wiechert potentials , which are derived directly from maxwell s equations in the relativistic case , see e.g.  jackson @xcite . using an arbitrary @xmath0 produces the result for eq .",

    "the subscript ` ret ' denotes evaluation at the retarded time @xmath7 . using eq .",
    "[ lwpot ] , it is possible to calculate the total static and vector potentials from a distribution of source charges , by summing the contributions from individual charges in the distribution .",
    "these can then be used to calculate the corresponding electric and magnetic fields .",
    "this alternative approach is used for instance by alvarez - muiz et al .  in the ` zhaires ' code @xcite . in our methodology",
    "however , we calculate the electric fields directly , since from the linard - wiechert potentials , the electric field in a dielectric , non - magnetic medium due to a particle of charge @xmath8 ( in c.g.s .  units ) can be expressed ( see e.g.  jackson @xcite ) as follows : @xmath9_{\\rm ret } \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\frac{q}{c } \\left [ \\frac{\\hat{r } \\times [ ( \\hat{r } - n \\vec{\\beta } ) \\times \\dot{\\vec{\\beta}}]}{(1 - n \\vec{\\beta } \\cdot \\hat{r})^3 r } \\right]_{\\rm ret } \\label{lweqn1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath10 the time - derivative of @xmath11 , and @xmath12 the usual relativistic factor of @xmath13 . the first term is the near - field term , since the strength of the resulting fields falls as @xmath14  in the case of @xmath15 , it reduces to coulomb s law .",
    "the second term is the radiation term , with the familiar @xmath16 dependence .",
    "the well - known maxim ` radiation comes from accelerated charges ' is seen easily by the dependence of this term on @xmath10 .    in most practical applications",
    ", the near - field term presents only a minor correction to the observed fields . from here on we formulate our methodology purely from the radiated field term only .",
    "thus the following expressions for the electric fields will be those arising solely from the particle acceleration . the applicability of this approximation is discussed in sec .",
    "[ discussion ] .",
    "the most simple acceleration event is the instantaneous acceleration of a particle at rest at time @xmath17 to a velocity @xmath18 , i.e.  @xmath19 , or equivalently the deceleration of such a particle from velocity @xmath18 to rest , i.e.  @xmath20 .",
    "such events can be termed , respectively , ` starting points ' and ` stopping points ' , ` acceleration ' and ` deceleration ' , or ` creation ' and ` destruction ' events .",
    "we define the electric field resulting from these events as @xmath21 , where the acceleration vector @xmath10 can be either parallel ( @xmath22 ) or anti - parallel ( @xmath23 ) to the velocity vector @xmath11 , corresponding respectively to acceleration ( at a starting point ) or deceleration ( at a stopping point ) .",
    "since @xmath11 changes only in magnitude , we write @xmath24 ( @xmath25 a unit vector ) , and use similar notation for @xmath26 and the time - derivatives : @xmath27 .",
    "thus only the scalar components will need to be expressed as functions of time .",
    "we proceed to derive @xmath21 from the rhs of eq .",
    "[ lweqn2 ] in terms of the ` lab - time ' ( observer time ) @xmath28 in both the time- and frequency - domains .",
    "similar derivations in both domains in the case of linear particle tracks ( effectively two endpoints  see sec .  [ cherenkov ] ) appear also in alvarez - muiz , romero - wolf , and zas @xcite , for the case of `` erenkov radiation '' : note that in the following no assumption on the nature of the radiation need to be made .",
    "the expression for the radiated component of the electric field ( from eq .",

    "[ lweqn1 ] since @xmath31 .",
    "we begin the frequency - domain derivation by taking the fourier - transform of eq .",
    "[ lweqn2 ] converted to the retarded time @xmath32 using @xmath33 and @xmath34 : @xmath35 a conceptual and mathematical difficulty to overcome is that at the time of acceleration , @xmath36 , and hence @xmath37 , is undefined .",
    "this can be dealt with by letting the acceleration last a finite ( but small ) time interval @xmath38 , then taking the limit as @xmath39 .",
    "writing @xmath40 , the acceleration takes place over the interval @xmath41 , during which we have @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 .",

    "the opposite is the case for a stopping point ( @xmath23 sign ) .    since the acceleration is instantaneous , the distance @xmath57 from the particle to the observer at the acceleration time is constant , and the time @xmath58 at which an observer would view the radiation emitted at time @xmath59 is given by @xmath60 .",
    "the time window @xmath52 in eq .",
    "[ time_derivation ] is therefore chosen to satisfy @xmath61 .",
    "while the electric field as a function of time @xmath62 becomes infinite in the case of instantaneous acceleration , the time - integrated electric field is finite and independent of the specific choice of @xmath63 .",

    "[ endpoint_eqn_f ] and [ endpoint_eqn_t ] for a radiating endpoint may appear as yet another special case of particle motion with very limited application .",
    "however , observe that in arriving at eqs .",
    "[ endpoint_eqn_f ] and [ endpoint_eqn_t ] , we have made no assumptions about the macroscopic motion of the particle  only that at a given instant , the particle becomes accelerated .",
    "as we will see , validating this assumption is really a question of describing the particle motion with sufficient accuracy for the frequency - range / time - resolution of interest , rather than being a limitation of the endpoint approach . in following sections",
    ", we will show how arbitrary particle motion can be described in terms of such endpoints .",
    "however , before proceeding to more complex situations , it is worthwhile examining the radiation from the most simple acceleration event , a single endpoint .",
    "the radiation pattern from a single endpoint is exactly that corresponding to a once - off acceleration event .",
    "a relevant physical situation would be the @xmath36-decay of a heavy element in vacuum , where the motion of the heavy nucleus can be neglected , and the emitted @xmath65 travels with constant velocity to infinity .",
    "there are quite a few interesting features of even this simple situation which are worthwhile to explore in greater depth .    for most applications ,",
    "it is preferable to use the vectorial notation given in eqs .",
    "[ endpoint_eqn_f ] and [ endpoint_eqn_t ] to describe the radiation from a single endpoint . however , for a single event , the radiation is cylindrically symmetric about the acceleration / velocity axis , so it is common to express these equations using an observer s position described by a distance @xmath3 and angle to the acceleration vector @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "this angular dependence is seen easily from the lhs of fig .",
    "[ synch_diagram ] . for this case ,",
    "the magnitude of the electric field vector in eqs .",
    "[ endpoint_eqn_f ] and [ endpoint_eqn_t ] respectively becomes : @xmath68 and it is taken as given that the unit electric field vector @xmath69 points away from the acceleration axis for @xmath70 and towards it for @xmath71 . at all times the angle @xmath66 is defined to be positive in the direction of positive velocity , irrespective of the acceleration .",
    "thus under the transformation @xmath72 , @xmath73 , eqs .  [ endpoint_eqn_f ] and [ endpoint_eqn_t ] are invariant , since @xmath74 .    to illustrate , eqs .",
    "[ sincos_endpoint_eqn_f]/[sincos_endpoint_eqn_t ] have been plotted in a vacuum and dielectric for varying @xmath36 in fig .",
    "[ single_endpoint_fig ] .",
    "firstly , note that for a single endpoint , the magnitude of the radiation in eqs .",
    "[ sincos_endpoint_eqn_f ] , [ sincos_endpoint_eqn_t ] has _ no _ frequency - dependence .",
    "this may seem counter - intuitive , since almost all radiation processes become characterised by their particular frequency - dependence .",
    "such frequency - dependence can only be produced however by the particle acceleration appearing differently on different wave - length scales , while a point - like acceleration looks identical on all scales , so that the resulting radiation could not possibly have any dependence on the wavelength / frequency . only in the quantum - mechanical ( extremely - high - frequency regime",
    " see sec .  [ discussion ] )",
    "will there be a frequency - dependence in the radiation from a single endpoint , since the particle will no longer appear point - like .",
    "secondly , observe that there is a singularity in the emitted electric field about @xmath75  this is the ` cherenkov ' singularity , which occurs at the cherenkov angle @xmath76 . here",
    ", the electric field strength becomes undefined .",
    "this is , of course , unphysical , since we do not observe infinite electric fields in nature .",
    "nonetheless , both eqs .",
    "[ sincos_endpoint_eqn_f ] , [ sincos_endpoint_eqn_t ] and reality can happily coexist since an observer will always observe the particle traversing some finite observation angle @xmath77 .",
    "writing @xmath78 , the divergent term in eqs .",
    "[ sincos_endpoint_eqn_f ] and [ sincos_endpoint_eqn_t ] can be expanded in the vicinity of @xmath79 as follows : @xmath80 the first term on the rhs , which diverges as @xmath81 , is odd about @xmath82 , while the second ( even ) term is finite .",
    "therefore , for any real measurement , an integral of the field about @xmath79 will have the divergent component cancel , leaving a finite result .",
    "in addition , any real medium will have a frequency - dependent refractive index , so that infinite field strengths will only be observed over an infinitely small bandwidth .",
    "finally , note that away from the singularity , there is a broad angular dependence which depends primarily on @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "there is no emission in the exact forward direction for any values of @xmath84 and @xmath0 , though for highly - relativistic particles in vacuum , the radiation pattern rises extremely rapidly away from @xmath85 , producing the characteristic forward ` beaming ' expected .",
    "also note that for mildly- and sub - relativistic particles , the emitted radiation at all angles changes with the particle energy , whilst in the ultra - relativistic regime , only extremely near to @xmath79 does the radiation pattern change with energy .",
    "we have derived both vectorial ( eq .  [ endpoint_eqn_f ] and eq .",
    "[ endpoint_eqn_t ] , in terms of @xmath55 , @xmath4 , @xmath0 , @xmath86 , and @xmath3 ) and scalar ( eq .  [ sincos_endpoint_eqn_f ] and eq .",
    "[ sincos_endpoint_eqn_t ] , in terms of @xmath84 @xmath66 , @xmath0 , @xmath86 , and @xmath3 ) equations for the radiation from an endpoint . for the sake of brevity , in this section we use only the scalar notation of eq .",
    "[ sincos_endpoint_eqn_f ] and eq .",
    "[ sincos_endpoint_eqn_t ] to describe the situation .",
    "despite eq .  [ sincos_endpoint_eqn_f ] and eq .  [ sincos_endpoint_eqn_t ] describing the radiation resulting from a particle accelerating from / to rest , they are , in fact , more general than this .",
    "this is because an arbitrary acceleration of a particle can be viewed as a superposition of deceleration and acceleration events , which will not cancel if either @xmath66 , @xmath84 , or @xmath0 differ between the two endpoints . for curved particle motion at constant speed",
    ", the angle @xmath66 from the acceleration vector to the observer will be different for coincident endpoints , while for gradually accelerating / decelerating particles , the values of @xmath84 will be different for simultaneous endpoints . in either case , contributions from starting and stopping points will not cancel , and radiation will occur .",
    "conversely , if a simple linear motion with constant velocity is described piece - wise as a series of starting and stopping endpoints , the terms will cancel completely  the particle will not radiate .",
    "superposition of endpoints in this way is sometimes viewed as destroying the ` old ' particle and creating a ` new ' one  since this formulation is applicable only to the radiated component , static fields ( which fall as @xmath87 ) can be ignored , so that bringing a particle to rest ( ` stopping ' it ) is equivalent to destroying it , and accelerating a particle from rest ( ` starting ' it ) is equivalent to creating it , and _ vice versa_. an arbitrary change in particle velocity can be dealt with by combining two simultaneous , coincident endpoints , the first to ` stop ' the particle by bringing it from its old velocity to rest , the second to ` start ' the particle by accelerating it to its new velocity .",
    "multiple particles / events can be treated by adding the contributions with appropriate @xmath66 , @xmath84 , @xmath0 , @xmath3 , and @xmath86 . in the case of a smoothly - varying velocity @xmath11",
    ", the values @xmath55 used at the endpoints should be representative of the average velocity between endpoints , which will tend towards the true value of @xmath11 as the number of endpoints used becomes large .",
    "any propagation effects between the source and the observer  e.g.  absorption in a medium , or transmission through an interface  should be applied to the ( spherically - diverging ) radiation from each endpoint .",
    "this can be simply done , since the relevant parameters ( e.g.  angle of incidence for transmission ) will be uniquely defined for each such endpoint .",
    "note that for ray - tracing methods , the rays will be diverging , and transmission problems should be handled accordingly .         to illustrate , we have plotted the emitted radiation in four elementary situations in a vacuum and dielectric in fig .",
    "[ vac_di_fig ] : a single endpoint representing an electron accelerating from rest ( ` acceleration ' ) ; the deflection of an energetic electron through @xmath88 ( ` deflection ' ) ; the deceleration of a fast electron ( ` slow - down ' ) ; and a reversal of direction in a mildly relativistic electron with no change in speed ( ` reversal ' ) . note in the three highly relativistic cases the characteristic beaming  in the forward direction for the vacuum case , and about the cherenkov angle @xmath89 in the @xmath90 dielectric . for velocity reversal ,",
    "significant peaks are observed at the cherenkov angle since @xmath91 , while in the vacuum case , no appreciable beaming is evident and the emission is broad , which is characteristic of ( non - relativistic ) dipole radiation .",
    "the simple examples presented in fig .  [ vac_di_fig ]  and eqs .  [ sincos_endpoint_eqn_f ] , [ sincos_endpoint_eqn_t ] themselves ",
    "deal only with point - like acceleration events , while in most situations particle motion will be smooth ; however , this is not a limitation in practice .",
    "every numerical simulation necessarily describes particle motion as a series of uniform motions joined by instantaneous acceleration events , for which either of eqs .",
    "[ endpoint_eqn_f ] or [ endpoint_eqn_t ] will calculate the emitted radiation _ exactly_.",
    "the key point is that the degree to which the radiation calculated from the addition of endpoint contributions resembles the true radiation is limited only by the degree to which the simulated motion resembles the true motion .",
    "usually this means that a particle simulator must be accurate to within a small fraction of the wavelengths of interest  for a discussion of this effect in practice , see for example the discussion in fig .  3 and appendix a of ref .",
    "@xcite or section 3 of ref .",
    "it is not a concern of this paper .      in our experience of applying the endpoint formalism to complex physical situations , two important cases where the formalism can be mis - applied have come to our attention .",
    "we discuss each below .",
    "the first case concerns the interpretation of the initial and final endpoints used to describe particle motion .",
    "if the initial endpoint is a starting / acceleration endpoint , this models the situation of a particle sitting at rest until suddenly accelerated , in which case the calculated radiation pattern will include a large contribution from this sudden acceleration . therefore , this will be the correct choice if , in the physical situation being modelled , the particle genuinely does begin from rest .",
    "if it does not , the large initial contribution will be artificial and incorrect .",
    "if , on the other hand , the initial point is a stopping / deceleration endpoint , the implied motion is that of a particle moving with uniform velocity for an infinite time until the time of the initial endpoint . given that such infinite uniform motion does not generally occur in nature , the usual interpretation for this choice is that of a particle beginning the calculation with a non - zero velocity , and that whatever motion it undertook before that point is not of interest to the calculation .",
    "the choice of final endpoint , obviously , has similar implications .",
    "for instance , in the case of synchrotron ( curvature ) radiation in sec .",
    "[ synch_sec ] , the initial point must be a stopping endpoint , and the final point a starting endpoint , since the radiation of interest is only that from the curved motion of the particle .",
    "however , for the radiation from a finite particle track in sec .",
    "[ cherenkov ] , the situation of interest really is that of a particle which accelerates from and decelerates to rest , and hence the initial and final endpoints are starting and stopping endpoints respectively .",
    "the second case involves ensuring that the velocity @xmath55 used at a starting endpoint and a subsequent stopping endpoint is consistent with the implied motion of the particle : if the particle is accelerated at a starting endpoint at @xmath92 and arrives at a stopping endpoint at @xmath93 , then the condition @xmath94 must be satisfied .",
    "furthermore , note that @xmath55 must be identical at both the starting and stopping endpoints .",
    "if @xmath55 changed between the starting and subsequent stopping point , this would imply an additional acceleration , and the radiation associated with this acceleration would not be accounted for , leading to incorrect results .",
    "this problem arises for an accelerating particle when the instantaneous particle positions and ` true ' velocities @xmath11 are known ( or simulated ) at discrete times , so that in general the velocities @xmath11 will not point towards the next known position . in such a case , one must realise that the velocities @xmath55 used in the endpoint treatment are representative of the time - averaged true velocity @xmath11 between endpoints . therefore",
    ", the correct treatment is to re - normalise each instantaneous @xmath11 ( in both direction and magnitude ) to the appropriate @xmath55 to fulfill the above - mentioned condition .",
    "this will become important in the following section ( sec .  [ synch_sec ] ) in the case of synchrotron radiation .",

    "while the @xmath104 term can be assumed constant , @xmath103 also changes the relative phase - factors between emission at different endpoints .",
    "note that every starting term is balanced at any time @xmath102 by a simultaneous stopping term at the same position .",
    "the reason the terms do not cancel is due to the direction of the velocity vectors @xmath105 differing between simultaneous starting and stopping terms .",

    "this is necessary so that the radiation modelled is due to the curvature of the particle ( that is , synchrotron radiation ) , rather than any sudden and large initial and final accelerations to bring the particle from / to rest , which would tend to dominate .",
    "finally , also note that the magnitude @xmath84 of the vectors @xmath55 used in the calculation must be slightly decreased from the ` true ' value @xmath36 , since the ( straight line ) distance between endpoints is slightly shorter than the distance along a circular arc ; similarly , the vectors @xmath55 will not be quite tangential . the necessity of this is also discussed in sec .",

    "interestingly , while the endpoint from which each contribution is derived changes across the boundary ( e.g.  the direct contribution comes from the stopping endpoint in medium @xmath154 , and from the starting endpoint in medium @xmath151 ) , the magnitude of each component is in fact continuous across the boundary .",
    "a complication which bears discussing is that in the regime @xmath192 of medium @xmath151 , the ` incident angle ' of the transmitted component can not be defined , since all incident angles from medium @xmath154 map to the range @xmath193 in medium @xmath151 .",

    "solutions to these equations exist even when the solution is not that for incoming and outgoing plane waves in which snell s law is usually defined .",
    "it is important in the endpoint formulation therefore to allow both reflection and transmission coefficients , and the contributions from individual endpoints , to be complex numbers .",
    "this is especially true when the refractive indices themselves can not be treated as purely real , as is the case for many applications of transition radiation on metallic targets .",
    "finally , note that any and all frequency - dependence must come from the frequency - dependence of the refractive indices .",
    "the endpoint formalism described above provides a simple , accurate , and intuitive method for calculating the radiation resulting from particle acceleration . using it ,",
    "the radiated electromagnetic fields due to particle acceleration can be calculated in either the time- or frequency - domain for arbitrary particle motion .",
    "the domain in which to perform an endpoint - calculation should be the same as that of the desired result .",
    "while the process of fast - fourier transforming between time- and frequency - domains is usually relatively quick , such transforms require an adequate number of points in the first domain to produce an accurate result in the second .",
    "this is especially true when a signal is localised in one domain ( e.g.  a short time - domain pulse , or a narrow - bandwidth signal ) , since then it will necessarily be spread over a great range in the other .",
    "usually , if both the time- and frequency - domains are of interest , it will be computationally quicker to perform two direct calculations than to generate excess data points in one domain and use a fast - fourier transform to convert to the other .",
    "such was the case for the example of synchrotron radiation presented in sec .",
    "[ synch_sec ] .",
    "the only exception to this rule is when dispersive effects ( changing refractive index with frequency ) become important , in which case frequency - domain calculations would be more practical .    like any method using a distribution of sources",
    ", the accuracy of the endpoint method will reflect the accuracy with which the distribution of endpoints reflects the true particle motion on scales of the smallest wavelength / highest time resolution of interest . with reasonable awareness of these issues",
    "however , our endpoint methodology can be used to calculate the radiation in some very complex physical situations , such as those described in sec .",
    "[ applications ] .    in emphasising the utility of the endpoint formulation",
    ", we should also mention its limitations , the most obvious of which is its classical foundation in maxwell s equations : it breaks down in any quantum - mechanical limit . specifically",
    ", it can not treat radiation processes involving only a single photon , nor the radiation of extremely energetic photons where the wavelength is of the order of the de broglie wavelength of the radiating particle(s ) .",
    "such limitations however are common to all classical methods of treating radiation and are not increased by our approach .",
    "the second limitation is that we have ignored the ` nearfield ' term from eq .",
    "[ lweqn1 ] .",
    "this does _ not _ mean that our formulation can not calculate radiation in the near - field of a source distribution .",
    "since each endpoint is point - like , any observer is always in the far - field of any particular endpoint .",
    "thus a near - field calculation requires only taking the trouble to re - calculate the direction to the observer from each endpoint individually . only in certain special circumstances , such as the case of vavilov - cherenkov radiation from non - accelerated systems as discussed in sec .",
    "[ cherenkov ] , will the near - field term provide a significant contribution to the observed electric fields .",
    "in general , this nearfield term will only become important when a large part of the charge distribution passes very close to the detectors , and for most experiments it will represent at most a minor correction only .    our last note is to emphasise that this paper is by no means the first to use ( explicitly or implicitly ) an endpoint - like treatment to solve for various radiation processes .",
    "the best - known endpoint - based treatment is the larmor formula for the power radiated by an accelerated charge , which is commonly used in derivations of other radiation processes ( again , see jackson @xcite ) .",
    "also , as discussed in the introduction , there are numerous examples in the literature where multiple classical radiation processes have been described using the same fundamental underlying physics .",
    "what we have done here is to explicitly state that _ all _ radiation from particle acceleration can be described in terms of a superposition of instantaneous accelerations ( endpoints ) , and give a general methodology for applying this method to an arbitrary problem .",
    "strong pulses of coherent radiation are expected from extremely high energy ( shower energy @xmath198  ev ) particle cascades in dense media .",
    "the mechanism for producing the radiation is the askaryan effect , whereby a total negative charge excess arises from the entrainment of medium electrons through e.g.  compton scattering , and the loss of cascade positrons via annihilation in flight @xcite .",
    "the radiation from the excess electrons travelling super - luminally through the medium will be coherent at wavelengths larger than the physical size of the cascade .",
    "the emission is the basis of the ` lunar technique ' @xcite , a detection method by which the radiation is observed from ground - based radio - telescopes .",
    "several current experiments utilise the technique @xcite , which has been proposed to detect both cosmic - ray and neutrino interactions .",
    "the emission from the askaryan effect is considered to be coherent vavilov - cherenkov radiation , since this is the mode of radiation upon which askaryan placed greatest emphasis in his papers @xcite , and the emission occurs in the case of charged particles moving super - luminally in a dielectric .",
    "if indeed this is the case , this would then lead to a formation - zone suppression of the radiation from near - surface cascades , such as those produced by cosmic rays , which interact immediately upon hitting the moon .",
    "the reasoning is as follows : consider such a near - surface cascade , induced by a cosmic - ray interaction near the regolith ( dielectric)-vacuum boundary .",
    "it has been both predicted @xcite and observed ( qualitatively by danos _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , and as a coherent pulse from single electron bunches by takahashi _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite ) that charged particles moving in a vacuum near a dielectric boundary generate vavilov - cherenkov radiation in the dielectric .",
    "analogously , as the distance between the cascade and the surface tends to zero , the radiation emitted into the vacuum will approach that from a cascade in the vacuum itself ( the ` formation - zone ' effect , first considered in this context by gorham _",
    "et al . _",
    "if indeed the emission from the askaryan effect is vavilov - cherenkov radiation , which is generated by the passage of a particle through a dielectric , then since vacuum is not a dielectric , the emitted power into the vacuum from cascades nearing the boundary must tend towards zero .",
    "thus the askaryan emission from cosmic rays will be highly suppressed if the emission is from vavilov - cherenkov radiation .    however , the emission from the askaryan effect is not in general vavilov - cherenkov radiation , because it arises from finite particle tracks viewed at a large distance .",
    "the emission is therefore of the same character as that produced in the ` tamm problem ' of calculating the ` vavilov - cherenkov radiation ' from a finite particle track in a dielectric medium when viewed at a large distance @xcite .",
    "however , it has been pointed out by zrelov and ruika @xcite that tamm s 1939 result for the radiation in such a problem originates from the acceleration / deceleration at the beginning and end of the track .",
    "thus neither tamm s approximate result , nor the majority of the radiation emitted , is truly vavilov - cherenkov radiation .",
    "given that the radiation from the askaryan effect arises from the coherent superposition of radiation from many finite particle tracks , the majority of detectable radiation produced by the askaryan effect ( in a dense @xmath199  g/@xmath200 medium ) itself is not coherent vavilov - cherenkov radiation at all , but rather coherent radiation from particle acceleration .",
    "macroscopically , the coherent radiation from microscopic accelerations and decelerations is correctly viewed as coming from the time - variation of net charge .",
    "note that a shock wave at the cherenkov angle will still be observed ( this is also seen in transition radiation , as previously discussed in sec .  [ tr_section ] ) . while askaryan also mentioned the possibility of coherent transition radiation and ` bremsstrahlung ' ( radiation from particle acceleration ) in his first ( 1961 ) paper , the majority of the paper refers to vavilov - cherenkov radiation and coherent radiation from a moving charge excess , rather than to an accelerated charge excess .",
    "thus the primary reason why the zero - emission argument is incorrect is that the radiation due to the askaryan effect does not resemble what is commonly considered to be ` true ' vavilov - cherenkov radiation as described in the frank - tamm picture @xcite , which presents a negligible contribution in the askaryan effect and indeed will tend towards zero as a particle cascade develops closer to a vacuum - interface . instead of the above arguments",
    ", the use of our endpoint formulation much more easily resolves the issue : charged particles are accelerated and decelerated , ergo , the system radiates , and the effect of the nearby surface from the point of view of a far - field observer is no worse or more profound than for any transmission problem .",
    "a second example is the case of radio emission from extensive air showers . when an energetic primary particle interacts in the upper atmosphere , it produces a cascade of secondary particles which can reach ground level .",
    "radiation at frequencies of a few tens to a few hundreds of mhz from the electron / positron component of these cascades has been both predicted @xcite and observed @xcite , with up until recently only fair agreement between predictions and measurements . the emitted radiation is often understood in terms of one or more classical radiation mechanisms , and it can be unclear as to what extent the mechanisms are different ways of explaining the same phenomena , or are truly separate effects .    the transverse current model @xcite describes the effect of the magnetic field as causing a macroscopic flow of charge ( a transverse current ) due to the different drift directions of electrons and positrons .",
    "the time - variation of this current in the course of the air shower evolution produces radiation polarized in the direction denoted by the lorentz force .",
    "a modern implementation of the transverse current model , the mgmr model @xcite , complements the transverse current emission with additional radiation components , in particular the emission from a relativistically moving dipole and from a time - varying charge excess , the latter of which essentially corresponds to the askaryan effect .",
    "difficulties can , however , arise in the separation of these phenomenological `` mechanisms '' . for example",
    ", a component similar to vavilov - cherenkov radiation would appear even in case of charge - neutral particle showers in the presence of a magnetic field , because the magnetic field would induce a sufficient spatial separation of the positive and negative charges for the electron and positron contributions not to cancel at the frequencies of interest @xcite .",
    "in contrast to such macroscopic descriptions , microscopic monte carlo models calculate the radio emission as a superposition of radiation from individual charges being deflected in the geomagnetic field .",
    "this approach , although originally inspired by the notion of ` geosynchrotron ' radiation @xcite , does in fact not need the assumption of any specific emission mechanism .",
    "monte carlo codes for the calculation of radio emission from extensive air showers have been realized by different authors in various time - domain implementations @xcite .",
    "it recently turned out , however , that all of these implementations ( and others ) in fact treated the emission physics inconsistently , thereby neglecting radio emission produced by the variation of the number of charged particles during the course of the air shower evolution . with the endpoint formalism described here",
    ", a new and fully consistent implementation of a microscopic modelling approach has been realized in the reas3 code @xcite .",
    "the universality of the endpoint formalism ensures that the radio emission from the motion of the charged particles is predicted in all of its complexity . in case of the reas3 code ,",
    "this becomes evident since both the `` transverse current '' radiation polarized in the direction of the lorentz force and the radially polarized `` charge excess '' emission is reproduced automatically and in good agreement with macroscopic calculations @xcite .",
    "the importance of a consistent treatment taking into account also the radiation due to the variation of the number of charged particles within an air shower is obvious when comparing results obtained with reas3 and results obtained by the former implementation in reas2.59 .",
    "this is illustrated for a specific example in fig .",
    "[ reas3_vs_reas2_pulse ] for the radio emission received by an observer 200 m south of the core of a vertical extensive air shower with a primary particle energy of @xmath201ev .",
    "the pulse shapes , the pulse amplitudes and the frequency spectra differ significantly . for a detailed comparison of reas3 and reas2",
    "we kindly refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "the next step in improving the simulations will be the inclusion of the refractive index of the atmosphere , which is slightly different from unity and varies with atmospheric density .",
    "we have presented an ` endpoint ' methodology for modelling the electromagnetic radiation produced by the acceleration of charged particles .",
    "the approach is universally applicable and is especially well - suited for numerical implementation .",
    "its universality has been illustrated by reproducing prototypical radiation processes such as synchrotron radiation , tamm s description of vavilov - cherenkov radiation , and transition radiation in the frequency- and time - domains .",

    "<S> we present a new methodology for calculating the electromagnetic radiation from accelerated charged particles . our formulation  the ` endpoint formulation ' </S>",
    "<S>  combines numerous results developed in the literature in relation to radiation arising from particle acceleration using a complete , and completely general , treatment . </S>",
    "<S> we do this by describing particle motion via a series of discrete , instantaneous acceleration events , or ` endpoints ' , with each such event being treated as a source of emission . </S>",
    "<S> this method implicitly allows for particle creation / destruction , and is suited to direct numerical implementation in either the time- or frequency - domains . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we demonstrate the complete generality of our method for calculating the radiated field from charged particle acceleration , and show how it reduces to the classical named radiation processes such as synchrotron , tamm s description of vavilov - cherenkov , and transition radiation under appropriate limits . using this formulation , we are immediately able to answer outstanding questions regarding the phenomenology of radio emission from ultra - high - energy particle interactions in both the earth s atmosphere and the moon </S>",
    "<S> . in particular , our formulation makes it apparent that the dominant emission component of the askaryan effect ( coherent radio - wave radiation from high - energy particle cascades in dense media ) comes from coherent ` bremsstrahlung ' from particle acceleration , rather than coherent vavilov - cherenkov radiation . </S>"
