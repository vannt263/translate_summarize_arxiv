    "reactions on few - body nuclei .",
    "well - known examples for clear experimental evidence of such effects are the @xmath5-cross section in deuteron photodisintegration @xcite and the @xmath6-interference structure function in electrodisintegration of the deuteron @xcite . in the meantime , a great number of theoretical investigations have been devoted to this question .",
    "one may distinguish between complete covariant approaches @xcite and those based on a nonrelativistic expansion including leading order relativistic contributions @xcite .",
    "with respect to the latter method , in most cases only a selected class of leading order relativistic terms of the one - body current , believed to be the most important ones , have been retained , such as the darwin - foldy term , the spin - orbit current , and the kinematic wave function boost .",
    "relativistic two - body currents from static pion and heavy meson exchange have been studied by truhlik and adam @xcite , but only selected one- and two - body operators have been considered , and boost corrections have been left out .",
    "a consistent treatment of all leading order terms has been presented in @xcite for elastic and inelastic electron deuteron scattering using a one - boson - exchange ( obe ) model for the @xmath7-interaction and in @xcite for deuteron photodisintegration in a pure one - pion - exchange ( ope ) model . in the latter work",
    ", it has been shown that although the spin - orbit current gives the most important relativistic contribution , the other terms of the same order can not be neglected and do show significant influence in some polarization observables .",
    "in particular , sizeable differences occurred between pseudoscalar and pseudovector @xmath8-coupling . furthermore , wave function corrections were of the same importance as other two - body current contributions .    with respect to relativistic effects in deuteron electrodisintegration , the work of tamura et al .",
    "@xcite can not be considered as definitive since their main emphasis has been on elastic electron deuteron scattering whereas the inelastic process has been studied for the threshold region only .",
    "for this reason , it is legitimate to present here a systematic and consistent investigation of relativistic effects in deuteron electrodisintegration in various kinematic regions of energy and momentum transfer .",
    "our approach is based on the theoretical framework used in @xcite which has been shown to be unitarily equivalent to the work of adam et al .",
    "it will be sketched in sect .",

    "all explicit expressions for the electromagnetic operators used in this work are listed in the appendix , where we have included in addition the @xmath9- and @xmath10-currents and the currents involving @xmath4-isobars .",
    "we will now turn to discuss a few specific questions concerning the various contributions .",
    "since we want to use the bonn potential models for the explicit calculations , we have to fix some parameters in the general expressions of @xcite for the pionic operators listed in appendix  [ twobody ] .",
    "to this end , we will briefly review the origin of these parameters .",
    "the parameter @xmath11 allows a mixing of pseudoscalar ( @xmath12 ) and pseudovector ( @xmath13 ) coupling in the hamiltonian @xmath14 @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes the nucleon mass , @xmath17 the nucleon momentum operator , @xmath18 and @xmath19 the coupling constants of ps- and pv - coupling , respectively , @xmath20 the pion field , and @xmath21 its mass . for the dirac matrices",
    "@xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 , the conventions of @xcite are used .",
    "it is well known @xcite , that these two couplings are unitarily equivalent ( equivalence theorem ) by applying the dyson transformation @xmath25 where @xmath26 , provided the coupling constants @xmath27 and @xmath28 fulfill the relation @xmath29 .",

    "scalar and vector potential , respectively , @xmath33 the electric and @xmath34 the magnetic field , and @xmath35 and @xmath36 the electric charge and anomalous magnetic moment of the nucleon . in this case",
    ", the dyson transformation of  ( [ dyson.trafo ] ) yields @xmath37 with an additional , the equivalence theorem violating term @xmath38 this may be summarized with the hamiltonian @xmath39 where the parameter @xmath40 switches the term @xmath41 off or on @xmath42 .",
    "another parameter is related to the barnhill freedom @xcite , which results from the possibility to decompose the `` odd '' part of the relativistic hamiltonian into two arbitrary terms @xmath43 \\nonumber\\\\   & &      -i\\nu\\frac{{g_{\\pi nn}}}{4m^2}\\beta             \\vec{\\alpha}\\!\\cdot\\!\\vec{b } \\left\\{\\hat{\\kappa},\\phi_\\pi\\right\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is the barnhill parameter .",
    "if one carries out the foldy - wouthuysen transformation starting with @xmath45 and then @xmath46 on the one hand , and with the full part @xmath47 at once on the other hand , one arrives at different , but unitarily equivalent results . within the @xmath0-matrix formalism",
    ", this freedom arises from different assumptions on the energy transfer at the @xmath48 vertex in the case of ps - coupling @xcite .",
    "since the parameters @xmath49 appear in two combinations only , it is more convenient to introduce the following new parameters @xmath50 and @xmath51 @xmath52 the setting @xmath53 corresponds to a chiral invariant interaction model , which was used throughout in this work .",
    "furthermore , the pionic operators of the extended @xmath0-matrix formalism @xcite correspond to @xmath54 .",

    "on the other hand , in @xcite these two - body parts are explicitly listed as meson exchange current operators ( mec ) .",
    "therefore we have to exclude them in order to avoid double counting .    with respect to the @xmath61-mec operators",
    ", we would like to mention that in most of the previous work usually only a few selected operators have been considered , namely those that can be generated from the @xmath2-mec operators by replacing terms of the form @xmath62 by @xmath63 , i.e. , @xmath64 in the later discussion we will call these terms `` pauli currents '' .",
    "they can be identified as the terms proportional to @xmath65 in @xmath66 in  ( [ jrhocr ] ) and @xmath67 in  ( [ jrhoxrc ] ) . because of the strong tensor coupling of the @xmath61-meson ( e.g. , in the bonn obepq potential one has @xmath68 )",
    ", it is expected that the pauli currents give the dominant @xmath61-mec contribution .      according to @xcite , the retarded nucleon - nucleon potential , generated through a taylor expansion of the meson propagator around the static limit ,",
    "may be written as @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the static , nonrelativistic potential , @xmath71 the energy transfer at the vertex , and @xmath72 is the static meson propagator .",
    "however , one should keep in mind that the restriction to lowest order is not a good approximation above the pion production threshold .",
    "in order to avoid an overestimation of retardation effects , we therefore switched off the retardation currents for energies above this threshold .",
    "since there is a certain freedom to express @xmath73 in terms of the particle coordinates , i.e. , in terms of the individual energy transfer onto the i - th nucleon @xmath74 , it is customary to parametrize this freedom by a retardation parameter @xmath75 @xmath76 the operators from @xcite and @xcite are equivalent for @xmath77 .",
    "however , in order to be consistent with the static bonn obepq potentials , one must set @xmath78 because for this choice the retarded potential vanishes in the center - of - mass ( c.m . ) frame .",
    "the boost current contributions arise from the fact that for a relativistic description of the two - body system the introduction of c.m .",
    "and relative coordinates @xmath79 does not lead to the trivial separation of the two - body wave function into a c.m .",
    "momentum eigenstate and an intrinsic wave function .",
    "rather one finds @xmath80 where the dependence of the intrinsic wave function on the c.m .",
    "motion is taken into account by the boost generator @xmath81 . here",
    ", @xmath82 describes the intrinsic wave function in the rest frame .",
    "it is not possible to circumvent this problem by choosing an appropriate reference frame , since the initial and final states move with different momenta because of the momentum transfer during the reaction . instead of transforming the intrinsic @xmath7 wave functions ,",
    "one incorporates the unitary transformation in the e.m .",
    "operators considering again the leading terms only @xmath83.\\ ] ] in this way the additional boost charge and current densities @xmath84 $ ] arise .",
    "the operator @xmath85 can be separated into a kinematic , interaction independent part @xmath86 and an interaction dependent part @xmath87 @xmath88 in @xcite one finds an expression for @xmath86 , which reads for the case of the two - nucleon system @xmath89 a nonvanishing , interaction dependent boost operator exists only for pseudoscalar meson exchange @xcite @xmath90      in order to regularize the various meson - nucleon vertices , it is customary to introduce a phenomenological form factor at each meson - nucleon vertex @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the four - momentum transferred at the vertex , and @xmath93 is the meson - nucleon coupling constant .",
    "these form factors are usually parametrized by the following functional forms @xmath94 the form factors are then expanded around the static limit ( @xmath95 ) @xmath96 where here and in the following the prime indicates differentiation with respect to @xmath97 .",
    "the resulting regularized static and retarded potentials are obtained by the substitutions @xmath98    the momentum dependence of the hadronic form factors leads to additional currents , the so - called vertex currents arising from minimal coupling . the vertex currents and the regularized currents",
    "can be combined leading to the following substitution rules for contact ( `` c '' ) , wavefunction renormalization ( `` w '' ) , and exchange ( `` x '' ) type operators ( see appendix  [ twobody ] ) @xmath99 the operators that do not fit into this scheme are the retarded x - type charge density operators . in order to fulfill the continuity equation with the other retarded operators they should be regularized using as substitution rule @xmath100 in  ( [ reg.all ] ) through  ( [ reg.rxt ] ) , the following abbreviations have been used for @xmath101 @xmath102      isobar currents arise from intermediate excitation of nucleon resonances .",
    "they may be included as effective , nonlocal two - body operators usually neglecting the hadronic interaction of the isobar .",
    "often the isobar propagation is also neglected in order to obtain a local operator . however , this approximation is not reliable .",
    "the other possibility is to introduce explicitly isobar degrees of freedom via isobar configurations in the wave function .",
    "this approach is chosen in the present work . in this way , the isobar propagation is directly included and furthermore the hadronic isobar - nucleon interaction can be easily incorporated . in fact , with respect to the treatment of the @xmath4 , which we consider here as the dominant isobar contribution , it is well - known from deuteron photodisintegration that above pion production threshold a dynamical treatment of @xmath4 degrees of freedom is mandatory @xcite .",
    "therefore , our calculation of the @xmath103 configurations is based on a @xmath7-@xmath103 coupled channel approach in momentum space . since their influence on the @xmath7 scattering phase shifts",
    "is already included implicitly in the realistic @xmath7 potential simulating intermediate @xmath4 excitation , we have to renormalize the latter in order to maintain the good description of the phase shifts below pion threshold .",
    "it turns out that the renormalization is achieved by the subtraction of an energy independent @xmath103 box .",
    "furthermore , @xmath2- and @xmath61-mec contributions related to the @xmath7-@xmath103 transition potentials are also included . in principle",
    ", the box subtraction leads to an additional current contribution , which we have not considered here .",
    "in order to fix the notation , we briefly collect the general formulae for the observables of deuteron electrodisintegration . the @xmath104-matrix element between an initial deuteron with momentum @xmath105 and spin - projection @xmath106 , and a final @xmath7-state with relative nucleon momentum @xmath107 , total momentum @xmath108 , total spin @xmath109 , and projection @xmath110 ,",

    "the interference form factors @xmath174 and @xmath175 exhibit quite dramatic effects from the relativistic @xmath2-contribution , whereas heavy meson currents are less evident .    as a particular interesting inclusive process",
    "we now will discuss deuteron electrodisintegration @xmath176 near break - up threshold at backward angles for two reasons .",
    "first of all , this reaction allows a comparison of our results with the work of tamura et al .",
    "@xcite . secondly and more importantly",
    ", this reaction is a beautiful example for the manifestation of subnuclear degrees of freedom in terms of meson exchange and isobar currents @xcite .",
    "indeed , up to a squared momentum transfer of about @xmath177 , one finds quite satisfactory agreement of the nonrelativistic theory with experimental data , provided one includes the most important contributions from @xmath2- and @xmath61-exchange and from @xmath4-excitation .",
    "however , at higher @xmath136 larger uncertainties arise for the theoretical predictions @xcite .",
    "in particular , relativistic effects become increasingly important @xcite . in view of the ongoing quest for signatures of quark - gluon effects in nuclear structure , it is very important to assess the size of such relativistic contributions .",
    "while in @xcite a sizeable reduction of the cross section by relativistic effects has been found , the inclusion of only the one - body contributions in @xcite has led to an enhancement .",
    "we had already suspected in @xcite that the reason for these different results is the neglect of relativistic two - body terms , in particular , from @xmath2-exchange .",
    "this is now confirmed by our results shown in fig .",
    "[ figx1 ] .",
    "as one can see , for example at @xmath178 , the relativistic one - body currents yield an enhancement of the cross section of about 60% , whereas the relativistic @xmath2-contributions give a very strong reduction by more than a factor five .",
    "this reduction is partially cancelled by heavy meson exchange and @xmath3-currents , so that the overall reduction with respect to the nonrelativistic result amounts to a little less than one half at this momentum transfer .",
    "these findings are in accordance with results of hummel @xcite .",
    "however , comparing them with the ps - coupling model in fig .",
    "12 of tamura et al .",
    "@xcite , we find quite significant differences .",
    "first , the reduction from all relativistic contributions to the one - body and pion sector in fig .  [ figx1 ] is much stronger than the one shown by the curve `` n.r .",
    "+ boost '' in fig .",
    "12 of @xcite .",
    "second , the effect of heavy meson exchange is much larger in @xcite ( see the full curve of fig .",
    "12 ) than what we find in fig .",
    "[ figx1 ] . in order to check",
    "whether this difference could originate from different potential parameters , different wave functions , and perhaps by putting the @xmath61-contribution to the relativistic part  ref .",
    "@xcite is not clear about this point  we have performed a calculation with the parameters from table  3 in @xcite listed under `` paris '' , using the wave functions for the paris potential ( @xmath179 ) and excluding the @xmath61-mec from the nonrelativistic calculation .",
    "certainly one might doubt , whether the potential model of @xcite called `` paris '' is a consistent model , since the paris potential is phenomenological and not a one - boson - exchange model .",
    "but otherwise it would be difficult to make a comparison .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath103 configuration is treated in the impulse approximation and the @xmath4-mec from @xmath2- and @xmath61-exchange are left out .",

    "12 in @xcite , we note quite a good agreement for the nonrelativistic calculation except for the minimum which appears at lower momentum transfer in fig .",
    "[ figtam ] .",

    "we also show in fig .",
    "[ figtam ] our total result for the bonn obepq - b potential which lies consistently above the `` paris '' result .",
    "but this is not surprising since already the nonrelativistic calculation revealed such a difference between the paris and various versions of the bonn potentials @xcite .",
    "finally , we show in fig .",
    "[ figpotdep ] a comparison of the results which are based on the three obepq - versions of the bonn potential including box renormalization with experimental data from @xcite .",

    "the data below @xmath180 have been averaged from @xmath181 to @xmath182 above the threshold and thus the calculation has been done at @xmath183 , whereas for the data above @xmath180 , averaged between @xmath181 and @xmath184 , the calculation has been performed for @xmath185 .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that it is not necessary to average the theoretical results",

    "let us first consider the structure functions of the differential cross section shown in fig .",
    "[ figover1 ] .",
    "the longitudinal structure function @xmath189 is mainly influenced by the relativistic one - body contribution and almost insensitive to the additional currents except for the relativistic pion contributions in the kinematic sector ic .",
    "even less influence is seen in @xmath190 . only in sectors",
    "ic , iia and iiia one finds some noticeable effects .",
    "the interference structure functions are a little more sensitive to the two - body relativistic currents , though not overwhelmingly , in sectors ic and iiia for @xmath191 , mainly from the pion , and significantly more pronounced from both pion and heavy mesons in ib , c and iia , c for @xmath192 .",
    "turning now to the structure functions of @xmath188 in fig .",
    "[ figover2 ] , we note in general a larger sensitivity to the additional two - body currents . except for the sectors ia and iia , one finds significant influences on @xmath193 in all other sectors , even for the quasifree case iib at the forward peak .",
    "similar effects occur in @xmath194 in the sectors ib , c , iia , and iiia .",
    "the interference structure function @xmath195 appears less sensitive except in sector ia , where one can see a drastic increase at forward angles , mainly from heavy meson exchange , whereas @xmath196 shows again a greater sensitivity , in particular in sectors ic , iia , iic , and iiia .",
    "finally , we show for this general overview in fig .",
    "[ figover3 ] the only nonvanishing structure function @xmath197 for longitudinally polarized electrons for both observables .",
    "while @xmath197 exhibits large effects from the pion - contribution , indeed much larger than the relativistic one - body part , in the sectors ib , c , iic , and iiia , c , one finds almost no effects from the two - body currents in @xmath198 .",
    "we will now discuss the relative importance of the various relativistic two - body currents for a few selected examples with respect to the sectors ic and iic .",
    "the relativistic contributions in the pionic sector , including the retardation corrections , are the most important ones beyond the one - body contributions as is demonstrated in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and  [ fig3 ] .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] again the structure functions of the unpolarized differential cross section for the kinematics ic and @xmath192 in addition in sector iic , where the separate terms of the relativistic @xmath2-exchange , namely @xmath2-mec , retardation , kinematic and potential boost , are consecutively added . in @xmath199 one can see quite a sizeable increase from the two - body charge density at larger angles , thus marking the area where siegert s hypothesis of a vanishing two - body charge density is not anymore valid @xcite .",
    "retardation effects , on the other hand , lead to a significant reduction in the forward direction . potential dependent boost effects , which are very small , arise from @xmath200 $ ] in  ( [ rhopichivn ] ) only . in @xmath201",
    "the effects are of similar size .",
    "only the relativistic @xmath2-mec show up , mainly at forward and backward angles as a sizeable reduction .",
    "retardation and other additional currents can be neglected . in the interference structure functions ,",
    "the effects are in general larger , although here one notes a partial cancellation of the various contributions .",
    "the strongest influence comes again from @xmath2-mec , in particular in @xmath192 in both sectors ic and iic and @xmath197 , then partially cancelled by retardation .",
    "the pionic two - body boost effects are very small . in @xmath192 the kinematic and potential boosts are equally small , while in @xmath191 and @xmath197 , one can see only a small effect from the potential boost .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we have collected a few polarization structure functions which exhibit particularly strong effects from the relativistic @xmath2-exchange sector . also here we see the large influence of the relativistic @xmath2-mec .",
    "it gives a strong enhancement in @xmath202 at forward angles , which is only slightly reduced by retardation . also here , the potential dependent boost contributions are negligible . in @xmath203 and @xmath204 @xmath2-mec",
    "produce for ic a large reduction and lead even to a partial sign change . again",
    "this effect is partially cancelled by retardation .",
    "the boost contributions are considerably smaller . for the kinematics iic ,",
    "the relativistic effects are much smaller in @xmath205 while they are still sizeable in @xmath196 compared to the sector ic .",
    "the non - pauli @xmath61-mec is generally a very small effect , especially the effect of the @xmath61-exchange charge density may safely be neglected .",
    "there are , however , a few polarization observables shown in fig .  [ fig4 ] that exhibit a slight sensitivity to the additional terms of the full @xmath61-mec beyond the pauli-@xmath61-mec , which is also shown separately , like @xmath192 in sectors ic and iic and for @xmath206 most prominent in ic , but very weak in iic . in these cases",
    "the two @xmath61-mec contributions are comparable in size but tend to partially cancel each other for @xmath192 and quite strongly for @xmath206 in sector ic .",
    "we also would like to mention that boost contributions to @xmath61-exchange , as well as to other heavy meson exchange , are completely negligible .",
    "the effect of the heavier mesons , i.e.  @xmath207 , @xmath208 , @xmath209 , @xmath210 , and @xmath3 is also small and quite unimportant as one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . only in @xmath192 , which is the smallest and thus the most sensitive of the first four unpolarized structure functions ,",
    "the influence of the @xmath3-terms is visible at high momentum transfer in both sectors , ic and iic , also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] .    at the end of this section",
    ", we would like to discuss briefly those two polarization observables , which presently are being measured experimentally @xcite in order to extract the electric form factor of the neutron @xmath211 , namely , the transverse polarization @xmath212 of the outgoing neutron and the vector beam - target asymmetry @xmath213 .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ aedv ] both observables at the quasifree kinematics @xmath163 , @xmath214 and electron scattering angle @xmath215 .",
    "it is the same kinematics as considered in @xcite where it was found that close to quasifree neutron emission ( @xmath216 ) the relativistic one - body contributions to these observables were negligible if sachs form factors were used . fortunately , this conclusion remains valid even when the additional relativistic contributions from @xmath2-exchange , heavy mesons , and @xmath3 are included . only away from the genuine quasifree situation ,",
    "i.e. , off @xmath5 and @xmath217 , significant effects are seen .",
    "these findings are very important with respect to the aforementioned experiments for the extraction of @xmath211 .",
    "in conclusion we may state , that besides the relativistic one - body currents also the corresponding two - body currents of the same order in @xmath1 show significant effects in both , inclusive and exclusive , observables , amenable to experimental investigations .",
    "as expected , the dominant two - body contributions come from the pionic sector , in particular , quite sizeable from retardation . but also heavy meson contributions are not completely negligible . therefore , a consistent treatment of all relativistic contributions , at least for @xmath2-exchange , is mandatory for a reliable assessment of such effects .",
    "the present treatment within the equation - of - motion approach is completely consistent for the leading order relativistic contributions as far as the pion exchange sector is concerned . in view of the in general small contributions from heavy meson exchange",
    "we do not consider the neglect of some relativistic terms , i.e. , the retarded current operators , from this sector as a severe shortcoming of our approach",
    ". a more severe limitation appears at energies above the pion production threshold with respect to the present treatment of retardation effects , the neglect of relativistic contributions related to isobar excitation , and the neglect of the current associated with the box renormalization .",
    "probably , one should aim at a hadronic interaction model where isobar configurations are introduced right from the beginning as is done for the argonne @xmath218 model @xcite .",
    "these will be topics for future research .",
    "another limitation arises from the @xmath1-expansion restricting the present approach to momentum transfers roughly below @xmath219 . for higher momentum transfers",
    "covariant approaches appear to be more appropriate .",
    "we would like to thank dr .",
    "p.  wilhelm for his help in the construction of the coupled channel model and various useful discussions .",
    "for completeness , we list here all explicit expressions for the electromagnetic charge and current densities in momentum space representation . since the c.m .",
    "motion is separated , we are left with the representation with respect to the relative momenta . thus all operators are represented in the form @xmath220 since the operators depend on the single particle coordinates , we describe them by the following kinematic variables @xmath221 where @xmath17 is the relative momentum of the outgoing nucleons , @xmath222 is the momentum transfer on the relative motion , and @xmath223 is the momentum of the virtual photon , i.e.  the momentum transferred on the c.m .",
