    "modern theories of the evolution of structure in the universe that include cold dark matter ( cdm ) grow galaxies and clusters of galaxies and their dark halos through the accumulation of smaller subunits ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the notion that the milky way ( mw ) halo was built up by protracted infall of `` protogalactic fragments '' after an initial central collapse had already been established by @xcite based purely on stellar population arguments . in cdm scenarios dwarf satellite galaxies represent the visible parts of ( predominantly dark ) subhalos ; however , the number of dwarf galaxies discovered so far is several orders of magnitude less than the predicted number of subhalos made by cdm simulations @xcite .",
    "this may be an indication that the majority of ( especially smaller ) subhalos have either not formed stars @xcite or have been destroyed @xcite , and that the visible satellites of today represent the high mass end of the mass spectrum of dm subhalos @xcite or those that were able to accrete substantial amounts of gas before reionization @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , dwarf galaxies exhibit some properties that may be inconsistent with the expected properties of cdm subhalos .",
    "for example , the flat central density profiles of dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies are at odds with the cuspy interiors predicted by cdm ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although this might be reconciled by appealing to triaxial halos @xcite . alternatively , warm dark matter ( wdm ) allows smaller central phase - space densities , and studies of dsph systems have provided important constraints on the properties of wdm species @xcite .",
    "in addition to the problem of the central concentrations of satellites , their apparent alignments around parent halos  as has been observed in the milky way and argued to be related to `` dynamical families '' of satellites @xcite  have also been used to question the viability of dwarf galaxies as putative subhalos @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "such alignments have also been reported in high resolution n - body , hierarchical structure simulations , where subhalos accrete along filaments @xcite .    despite uncertainties over the precise connection of observed satellite galaxies to the prevailing theoretical cdm models",
    ", it has become observationally clear that satellite galaxies and even star clusters @xcite could be significant contributors to the _ luminous _ halo of the mw and other galaxies .",
    "n - body simulations @xcite show how a dwarf galaxy can experience tidal disruption in its outer parts during close encounters with the central potential well of mw - like , parent systems .",
    "stars that escape the system will form tidal tails , like those observed in the sagittarius ( sgr ) system ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such extratidal stars can create `` breaks '' in the projected radial star - count profiles of the satellites as the density law transitions from a steeply - declining central density law for bound stars to a much more gradual decline at radii where unbound stars start to contribute significantly .",
    "such `` breaks '' have been observed in several mw dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) satellites @xcite .",
    "for example , the radial density profiles of nearly every one of the then - known dsphs of the milky way in the thorough ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ih95 ) study ( see their figure 2 ) show an excess of stars with respect to the outer parts of their best - fitting model king profiles . in the particular case of leo  i , because of its extreme distance , the number of dsph stars relative to the background level in the outermost regions was too low to judge conclusively the significance of its apparent break and limited the ability of ih95 to explore the leo  i profile significantly past the king limiting radius with their photographic star counts . undoubtedly , a radial surface density profile with better signal - to - noise and spatial coverage will help verify whether this extremely distant galactic companion shows the break profile trait seen in other mw dsphs . determining the structure of leo i to large radii is a primary goal of the present study .",
    "a second goal is to increase our understanding of the internal dynamics of leo i. if dsph galaxies are the visible counterparts of the largest dm lumps ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , one might expect the process of tidal disruption to be inhibited or lessened in these massive subhalos . on the other hand ,",
    "if dsphs can be proven to have tidal tails , the latter would place constraints on the dark matter components within these objects @xcite .",
    "the sgr dsph provides a vivid example of a tidally disrupting system for which the degree of disruption , as measured by the nature of the tails , has been used to constrain its dark matter content @xcite ; on the other hand , the sgr system is sometimes considered to be an exception to the norm for dsph galaxies @xcite .",
    "that sgr may _ not _ be an exceptional case is suggested by studies of possible tidal disruption in other mw dsphs @xcite .",
    "the effects of tidal disruption can be inferred not only by the existence of `` break '' in the density profiles of these other mw dsphs , but also , more recently , by the velocity characteristics of the dsphs at large radii .",
    "the past decade has seen substantial progress in measuring radial velocities for large numbers of stars in at least the more nearby mw dsph galaxies @xcite .",
    "these studies not only imply large central mass - to - light ratios in many of the satellites , but generally reveal relatively flat velocity dispersion profiles reaching into the break profile regions @xcite , a phenomenon reproducible in n - body simulations of disrupting , _ mass - follows - light _",
    "satellites @xcite .    however , a tidal disruption interpretation of these velocity dispersion profiles to large radii is not unique based on the extant data , because flat velocity dispersion profiles may also be accommodated to arbitrary radii by extending the dm halos in which the luminous dsphs are embedded .",
    "these `` equilibrium models '' imply mass - to - light ratios that increase with radius and boost the global ratio  in some cases quite substantially ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "knowing whether mass follows light in dsphs or if their luminous components lie within extended dark halos is critical to establishing the regulatory mechanisms that have inhibited the formation of galaxies in all subhalos and the extent to which luminous satellites are vulnerable to disruption and populate the stellar halos of @xmath12 galaxies .",
    "leo  i provides an interesting contrasting case to other dsphs in that ( 1 ) this particular satellite clearly has an unusual orbit that has protected it from but a few potential tidal encounters , and ( 2 ) unlike the apparently high @xmath9 systems ( like ursa minor , draco and carina ) , the previously measured mass - to - light ratio of leo  i is only @xmath13 , i.e. at the low end of the dsph @xmath9 scale . of course , it is of interest to know whether and how these two traits of this satellite may relate , and whether the properties of leo  i , if explored more extensively , may lend new insights into the issues raised above .",
    "for example , as we shall show in this paper , new signatures found in the velocity distribution of leo  i stars at large radii ( namely , an asymmetry ) may provide a way to break the degeneracy in interpretations of the velocity dispersion profile for at least some dsphs .",
    "the heart of our study is a new photometric survey covering 4.5 deg@xmath14 of the sky centered on leo  i , and new keck spectroscopy of 105 more leo  i giant stars than available in the literature . as with other contributions in this series",
    ", we adopt a technique based on multicolor washington filter imaging , including the use of the @xmath3 filter centered on the gravity - sensitive mgh+mgb triplet spectral feature near 5150   to identify giant stars associated with the leo  i dsph .",
    "we use bright k giants of leo  i as a tracer population of the structure of the dsph because ( 1 ) they are the most easily detected type of stars over large areas with the use of a mid - size telescope , ( 2 ) the washington+@xmath3 separation technique has already been proven successful in the discrimination of metal - poor dsph giant stars from foreground metal - rich field dwarf stars and thereby to significantly increase the signal - to - noise of the faint , diffuse outer parts of local group dsphs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and ( 3 ) these stars are accessible to spectroscopic membership and dynamical follow - up with the currently largest telescopes .",
    "because we are able to explore the leo  i dsph to large radii with much better signal - to - noise than previous studies , we can rederive the structural parameters for leo  i (  4.1 ) , which are important to assessing the @xmath9 using the traditional , @xcite methodology based on the internal dynamics of the system . a newly derived @xmath9 for leo  i in this way",
    "is discussed in  4.2 .",
    "we also explore the possible mass distribution for leo i within the context of a tidal disruption scenario using @xmath7-body simulations of leo i  like satellites orbiting a mw  like galaxy in  6.2 .",
    "the unusually high radial velocity of leo  i at its extreme distance naturally leads to interesting questions about its specific orbit .",
    "there have been two studies that are in disagreement about potential orbits for leo  i. on one hand , @xcite conclude that leo  i was once loosely bound to m31 and now is in an unbound , hyperbolic orbit about the mw .",
    "they estimate leo  i s mw perigalactic distance to be @xmath15 kpc and for this nearest approach to have occurred 2 - 4 gyr ago . on the other hand , in an earlier study",
    ", z89 concluded that leo  i probably did not originate in the m31 system and that _",
    "the most reasonable assumption is that leo  i is bound to the mw_. an unexpected benefit of our study is that we have been able to derive new constraints on the leo  i orbit from detailed study of its structure and dynamics (  6.2 ) , and we find reasonable agreement of these results to inferences about leo  i s orbit based on its star formation history .",
    "dwarf spheroidal galaxies , with other halo objects such as globular clusters and field stars , are also useful test particles for probing the large scale mass distribution and total mass of our galaxy . despite much work ,",
    "the spatial extent and total mass of the mw remain among the more poorly established galactic parameters .",
    "while traditionally thought to be a `` lesser sibling '' to the andromeda galaxy ( m31 ) in terms of mass , some recent work @xcite suggests that , in fact , the mw edges out m31 as the most massive galaxy in the local group . with the traditional analyses ,",
    "the mass estimate is sensitive to the inclusion or exclusion of one particular object , leo  i because of its combined unusually large galactocentric radial velocity ( @xmath16 km / s ; ) and great distance ( @xmath17 kpc , see  1.2 ) .",
    "estimates of the galactic mass by z89 varied by a factor of 34 depending on whether leo  i is considered as bound to the mw or not . while recent studies by @xcite , @xcite have decreased the dependency of mw mass estimates on including leo  i by using bayesian likelihood methods and larger samples of halo objects , leo  i is still considered to be a determining factor for fine tuning the results .",
    "the leo  i dsph was discovered more than half a century ago by @xcite during the first palomar sky survey .",
    "due to its extreme distance and its angular proximity to the 1st - magnitude foreground star regulus , photometric studies of leo",
    "i have been difficult . not until ccd arrays were developed",
    "were the first color - magnitude diagrams ( cmd ) of leo  i constructed .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite presented early ground - based cmds .",
    "later , @xcite and @xcite presented leo  i cmds based on data taken with the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) and they reach the main- sequence turnoff ( msto ) of the oldest ( @xmath18 gyr ) leo  i populations . these deep cmds allowed detailed studies of the multiple stellar populations and the complex star formation history of leo  i @xcite .",
    "leo  i was thought to be unique among the mw satellite dsphs for not having a conspicuous horizontal branch ( hb ) population until a 12@xmath19 12  ground - based survey on leo  i by @xcite revealed an extended hb structure in its cmd .",
    "more recently , @xcite discovered more than 70 rr lyrae variables with pulsational properties suggesting an intermediate oosterhoff type similar to other dwarf galaxies in the local group @xcite .",
    "the existence of both extended blue hb population and rr lyrae stars suggest that leo  i is in fact similar to other local dsph galaxies in having a @xmath18 gyr population , likely formed in the initial collapse of the system .",
    "the extended star formation history of leo  i , which includes this initial starburst , followed by a quiescent phase and a new burst of star formation activity starting @xmath20 gyr ago @xcite may be intimately tied to its orbital dynamics , since close interactions between galaxies are known to be triggers of star formation .",
    "the distance to leo  i has been derived using various photometric methods . @xcite",
    "used the tip of red giant branch ( trgb ) method to derive the leo  i distance modulus @xmath21 , while @xcite used both the apparent magnitudes of red clump and of the carbon stars to estimate @xmath22 .",
    "@xcite used the mean magnitude of rr lyrae variables in leo  i and derived @xmath23 , and more recently , @xcite provided a new estimate of @xmath24 using the trgb method .",
    "a weighted average of the distance modulus derived in the four studies gives @xmath25 , which converts to a distance of @xmath17 kpc . throughout this study",
    ", we adopt these values .",
    "the following sections include a presentation of the data from our photometric survey of leo  i (  2 ) , and a description of the photometric identification of the leo  i giant star candidates (  3 ) . the two - dimensional distribution of leo  i giant star candidates is discussed in  4 , and new morphological parameters for the dsph are derived . in  5 we present new keck observatory spectroscopy of a subsample of our leo  i giant candidates and in  6 we discuss the implications of our results , making use of new @xmath7-body simulations of a tidally disrupting dsph satellite galaxy that appear to generate similar leo  i properties to those we have observed",
    ". finally , a summary of our work and conclusions are in  7 .",
    "the images used in this study were obtained with the mayall 4 meter telescope at kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) during the nights of ut 1998 november 17 and 2002 may 2 - 5 .",
    "we used the mosaic i 8k@xmath198k ccd , which has a pixel scale of @xmath26 per pixel resulting in a 36@xmath1936 arcmin@xmath0  field of view .",
    "the camera is an array of eight 2048@xmath194096 ccd chips .",
    "we used the broad - band washington @xmath1 , harris @xmath27 , and intermediate - band @xmath3 ( hereafter , @xmath28 ) filters .",
    "filter as @xmath2 filter since their response curves are nearly identical ( see , e.g. , fig . 1 of lejeune & buser 1996 and discussion by majewski et al",
    ". 2000a ) . ]",
    "our survey fields were selected to lie predominantly along the major axis of leo  i. the area to the north of leo  i was sampled but a large part to the south of leo  i was avoided due to regulus .",
    "all program fields were overlapped by 6  with adjacent fields as a check on consistency of the photometry .",
    "table [ t : obs_log ] summarizes the basic information of the ccd fields used in this study .",
    "the raw images were pre - processed using the ccdproc task in the iraf mscred package .",
    "the flat - fielding was done with special care since the kpno @xmath2 and @xmath28 passband images are affected by a pupil image that produces an artifact that increases the amount of background light near the center . the @xmath2 and @xmath28 images also suffer from fringing .",
    "we carefully followed the procedures described in @xcite to correct for these effects .",
    "once the pre - processing was done , we split each mosaic image into its eight sub - images and performed stellar photometry via the daophot ii / allstar @xcite package . a point - spread function ( psf )",
    "was constructed using 25 - 50 bright and isolated stars for each sub - image .",
    "the quality of each psf was improved by removing neighboring stars and reconstructing the psf iteratively .",
    "psf magnitudes were derived using unix shell scripts based on allstar .",
    "the growth - curve analysis package daogrow @xcite was then used to correct for the missing light lying outside of the psf tail ( the aperture correction ) .",
    "measured instrumental magnitudes were calibrated against geisler ( 1990 , 1996 ) standards that were observed many times in different airmass ranges over each observing run .",
    "we fit a transformation equation of the form : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the geisler standard magnitude , @xmath31 is the instrumental magnitude , @xmath32 is the observed airmass , and @xmath33 is the color index .",
    "we tested for terms in @xmath34 and these were found to be negligible .",
    "the colors @xmath35 and @xmath36 were used in the equations derived for the @xmath1 and @xmath28 filters , respectively . a color term for the @xmath2 filter",
    "was also found to be unnecessary .",
    "the rms of the solutions for the transformation equations were less than 0.01 magnitude in all three filters .",
    "for the 1998 observations , we used the existing transformations derived for other observations on these same nights by @xcite .",
    "he notes that on the night of ut 1998",
    "november 17 there were minor transparency variations , so this night s data are considered non - photometric .",
    "we subsequently tied the 1998 photometry to that of may 2002 in the following manner : first , multiply - measured stars in the overlapping regions among the 2002 observations were used to derive and apply frame to frame offsets , which in most cases were less than 0.01 magnitudes for all three filters .",
    "this ensures that all of the 2002 observations share the same photometric zero - point .",
    "we then used stars in overlapping regions of the 1998 and 2002 observations to calculate the average magnitude offsets of each non - photometric frame relative to the photometric ones , and the corresponding offsets were applied to all objects in each non - photometric frame .",
    "we iterated these steps until all of the average offsets among all frames were less than 0.001 magnitudes .",
    "we note that images taken with mosaic ccds such as those used in this study may suffer from chip - to - chip sensitivity differences that could make the color terms be chip  dependent .",
    "@xcite found that the chip - to - chip color terms of the kpno mosaic to be negligible by observing the standard fields in washington and ddo51 filters on every ccd chip in the mosaic array and by cross - comparing the standard coefficients for each chip .",
    "astrometry of the detected objects was obtained by running the tfinder task in the iraf finder package and using usno - a v2.0 catalog stars @xcite as reference . since leo  i is located at a high galactic latitude ( @xmath37 ) , the foreground reddening is not significant [ according to schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis 1998 , @xmath38 .",
    "it is , however , important to consider the variation of reddening within and across our program fields which may result in systematic differences in stellar magnitudes and colors .",
    "each object in our data set has been corrected for reddening based on its galactic coordinates ( converted from the equatorial coordinates ) and direct reference to the reddening map constructed by @xcite .",
    "the @xmath39 of all objects in our fields range from 0.031 to 0.050 .",
    "our survey covers a large spatial area and our photometry is likely to contain a large number of galaxies .",
    "bad columns , random cosmic rays , and photoelectron bleeding from saturated stars are other possible nonstellar contaminants .",
    "nonstellar objects were eliminated from our photometry using the two daophot image quality diagnostic parameters sharp and @xmath40 .",
    "all sources beyond the range @xmath41 sharp @xmath42 were considered as objects with extreme non - stellar morphology , and were rejected . in case of @xmath40 , our experiments show that the acceptable range changes as a function of radial distance from the center of leo  i because crowding near the center affects the stellar profiles .",
    "therefore , we have elected to use a different @xmath40 selection criteria for sources inside a major axis radial distance , @xmath43 = 79 , @xmath44 = 0.21 , for defining the tidal boundary of leo  i. ] of 8 arcmin ( @xmath40@xmath45 ) and outside this radius ( @xmath40@xmath46 ) .    in figure",
    "[ f : magerr ] , we plot the daophot internal photometric error for the final catalog stars as functions of calibrated magnitudes in the three different bands .",
    "figure  [ f : entiremap]a shows the sky distribution of all stars detected by daophot in celestial coordinates .",
    "the varying density of sources reflects differences in limiting magnitude and seeing among our different fields .",
    "figure  [ f : entiremap]b shows the distribution of sources to a uniform depth . in figure",
    "[ f : cmd ] , we show the @xmath47 and @xmath48 cmds for the stars in figure  [ f : entiremap]a .",
    "the left and right panels of figure  [ f : cmd ] show the cmds for stars in the central field of leo  i ( c field ) and in all other fields , respectively .",
    "the dominant cmd structure seen in the left panels is the upper part of leo  i red giant branch ( rgb ) .",
    "the prominent leo  i red giant clump ( rgc ) is present at @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) and @xmath51 . a small clump of asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars at @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) and @xmath54 is also apparent .",
    "one other noticeable feature in the left panels of figure  [ f : cmd ] is the group of stars at @xmath55 and @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "these stars are thought to be anomalous cepheids or short period cepheids of a few hundred myr age @xcite .",
    "the right panels of figure 3 are more or less typical cmds for a high galactic latitude field containing a mixture of galactic disk stars , halo giants , field hb and blue straggler stars .",
    "the sharp edge at @xmath58 is due to the main - sequence turnoff ( msto ) of field stars smeared in apparent magnitude by the range of distances along the line of sight ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the many stars bluer than @xmath59 are likely field hb stars and blue stragglers .",
    "however , some low density of leo  i stars of all types may also lie in the outer fields , swamped by the milky way foreground .",
    "the methodology we use in this study to select clean samples of leo  i giant star candidates is adopted from that used by @xcite and subsequent papers in this series . in summary , we photometrically select stars that have ( 1 ) magnesium ( mgh + mg@xmath60 ) band / line strengths consistent with those of giant stars , and ( 2 ) combinations of surface temperature and apparent magnitude consistent with the rgb of leo  i. in the following sections , we demonstrate the applications of these two criteria using our @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath28 photometry . to improve the reliability of our leo  i giant star catalog , we restrict our sample to the stars that have photometric errors less than 0.04 mag in each band .",
    "the @xmath28 filter measures the strength of the mgh+mg@xmath60 spectral feature which is a good indicator of stellar surface gravity .",
    "since dwarf and giant stars are differentiated by their surface gravities , we use the @xmath61 colors  where @xmath1 filter acts as a _ continuum _ measure against @xmath28  combined with the surface temperature sensitive @xmath62 color has a linear relationship with @xmath63 , which is a good surface temperature indicator for late type stars . ] to separate the foreground dwarf stars and distant metal - poor giant stars .",
    "the use of the @xmath64 color - color diagram as a dwarf / giant separating tool has been utilized in several studies @xcite .",
    "figure  [ f : ccdselect ] shows the color - color diagrams for all stars that survived the magnitude error , sharp , and @xmath40 rejection . to better show the difference of the @xmath65 distribution between two distinct components , _",
    "i.e. _ leo  i giants and foreground dwarf stars , we divide our plot into stars in ( a ) the c field alone and ( b ) all other fields .",
    "the central part of the top panel of figure  [ f : ccdselect ] is dominated by leo  i giant stars whereas the lower panel shows mainly the elbow - shaped , high - metallicity dwarf star locus and only a few stars in the classic `` giant '' region of the diagram ( see majewski et al .",
    "the solid bounding box is defined as follows .",
    "the bottom and right boundaries were set by using the distribution of leo  i giant stars in the top panel .",
    "the lower - left boundary was drawn roughly parallel to the dwarf locus but offset by about + 0.1 magnitude in @xmath66 to account for the increased color errors at the faint end of our data set .",
    "we note from figure  [ f : ccdselect]a that this conservative limit does result in the loss of the bluest leo  i giant stars , but ensures that few dwarf stars will scatter into our selection .",
    "we truncate the upper - left boundary of the box at @xmath67 since this corresponds to the blue boundary of our color - magnitude selection region discussed below .",
    "stars are considered to be giant candidates if they are inside the bounding limits in the two - color diagram .",
    "our color - color selection rejects all but the most metal - poor ( [ fe / h ] @xmath68 ) foreground dwarf stars , whereas most dwarf stars at higher metallicities lie mainly on the elbow - shaped locus @xcite .      to select a purer sample of leo  i giants ,",
    "we now apply a second , color - magnitude criterion to our giant candidate list .",
    "regardless of the angular separation from the core of leo  i , any giant star in figure  [ f : entiremap ] associated with leo  i should have a combination of @xmath62 and @xmath1 magnitude that places them within the giant branch of leo  i. the left panel of figure  [ f : cmdselect ] shows the cmd for giant candidate stars within the ih95 tidal boundary of leo  i , while the right panel is for all of the giant candidate stars .",
    "we use the stars in the left panel to delineate the rgb structure in the cmd .",
    "the boundaries were drawn to roughly follow the overall structure of the giant branch .",
    "the box is slightly extended to a point brighter and redder than the tip of rgb to include some leo  i stars on the tip of the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) .",
    "the lower boundary was set at @xmath69 where the luminosity function of our color - color selected stars turns over due to incompleteness .",
    "we note that the nine stars brighter than @xmath69 lying outside of the rgb selection region in figure  [ f : cmdselect]a are likely other ( asymptotic ) giant members of leo  i , but we elect to exclude these few stars in the interests of maintaining a conservative selection that excludes interloping non - members .",
    "this cmd selection criterion is finally applied to the entire sample of giant candidates as shown in figure  [ f : cmdselect]b . in this way ,",
    "a total of 1282 stars are selected as leo  i giant candidates .",
    "it is worthwhile to compare the results of our giant star selection criteria against known spectroscopically and photometrically confirmed leo  i members .",
    "m98 obtained spectra of 32 stars within the core radius ( @xmath70 ) of leo  i and another one just outside of @xmath70 .",
    "the results from their derived rvs show that all 33 of these stars in this densest part of leo  i are members of the dsph .",
    "there have also been carbon star surveys of leo  i using spectroscopic @xcite and photometric data @xcite .",
    "stars 21 and 24 of m98 sample are the same stars listed as carbon stars azzopardi18 and azzopardi1 , respectively in @xcite .",
    "we have cross- identified 28 red giant stars of m98 , 14 carbon stars of @xcite , and 2 carbon stars of @xcite with our photometry .",
    "other stars in the past literature that were not cross - identified in our survey are missing because they are situated within the physical gaps of the mosaic ccd chips .",
    "figure  [ f : crossid ] shows the identified giant ( _ filled squares _ ) and carbon stars ( _ filled triangles _ ) in the color- color diagram ( top panel ) and the cmd ( lower panel ) . the two reddest carbon stars ( _ inverted filled triangles _ )",
    "are from @xcite .",
    "it is immediately apparent that the carbon stars are not situated within the giant star selection region in the color - color diagram . instead",
    ", these stars extend to the lower right part of the diagram indicating that the carbon stars have strong absorption features within the @xmath28 filter bandwidth .",
    "in fact , carbon stars are well known to have a strong c@xmath71 swan band absorption feature at a bandhead of @xmath72 5165   ( see e.g. , fig . 1 of * ? ? ? * for a representative spectrum of an r - type carbon star ) , well within the bandwidth of the @xmath28 filter . despite the weak surface gravity of these cool giant stars ,",
    "the strong c@xmath71 absorption lines dominate the @xmath66 color and place the carbon stars away from the giant selection regions shown in figure  [ f : crossid ] . on the other hand ,",
    "all but three of the normal giant stars in the m98 sample are within the color- color selection box ( figure  [ f : crossid]a ) .",
    "we could include these three stars by extending the lower boundary of our color - color selection box , but because it might introduce more contaminants ( such as metal - poor subdwarfs from the thick disk or halo ) , we opted not to do so .",
    "our rgb selection in the lower panel includes all m98 giant stars .",
    "the placement of _ filled squares _ in figure [ f : crossid ] thus substantiates the reliability of our selection technique , though we note that all cross - identified non - carbon giant stars of leo  i lie in the bright end of the giant branch where photometric errors are on average only 0.01 magnitude in all three bands .",

    "of particular interest are the 52 stars that lie outside the limiting radius found by ih95 and 26 stars outside twice the ih95 limiting radius .",

    "interestingly , we find that stars _ spill over _ the ih95 boundary from the main body of leo  i predominantly along the semi - major axis to both sides .",
    "we discuss the more extended distribution of `` leo  i giant candidates '' below .",
    "the two - criteria leo  i giant star selection method described above is designed to maximize the reliability of our candidate selection .",
    "however , our final sample may still contain contaminants .",
    "any halo giant or extreme ( [ fe / h]@xmath73 ) subdwarf with an observed @xmath47 combination similar to our leo  i rgb stars can be caught in our color - color and color - magnitude selection net .",
    "so too can normal metallicity dwarfs artificially scattered into the selection from photometric errors ( these will be main sequence turnoff dwarfs or subgiants with @xmath74 , so that these will also be predominantly from the milky way halo )",
    ". the number of these contaminants can be estimated by a simple technique described in @xcite and @xcite : offset the rgb selection box to brighter magnitudes and count the stars that fall in the offset box .",
    "assuming that the density of halo stars is approximately represented by a @xmath75 power law ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the number of halo stars per unit solid angle is flat with respect to magnitude to first order .",
    "therefore , the number of stars within the offset box should remain roughly constant as a function of magnitude offset .",
    "the carina and ursa minor fields were in compliance with such predictions @xcite .",
    "however , inspection of figure  [ f : cmdselect]b already suggests that the amount of contamination in our case is very low because there are very few stars picked as giant candidates that are brighter than the rgb selection box .",
    "nevertheless , we repeated the exercise and the results are presented in table [ t : halogiantcount ] .",
    "the four faintest offset bins are still counting a number of leo  i giants including the agb stars left out by our color - magnitude selection box . at the largest magnitude offsets ,",
    "the sampling of the cmd is incomplete due to the saturation of bright stars in our fields .",
    "therefore , the bins to be considered are @xmath76 .",
    "we take the average of these six bins and estimate the background level in our case to be @xmath77 for the entire field and @xmath78 for the field outside an ellipse drawn from the ih95 structural parameters , which has an area of @xmath79 deg@xmath14 ( errors have been calculated assuming poissonian statistics ) .",
    "this converts to a background density of @xmath80 deg@xmath81 .",
    "the number of leo  i giant candidates found outside the king limiting radius is twenty times this background level .",
    "while our derived background level is considerably smaller than was found in the previous studies of the carina and ursa minor fields , leo  i is at a higher galactic latitude and , moreover , we have employed a very conservative color - color selection .",
    "for example , if we use a different color - color selection box by bringing the lower - left boundary closer to the metal - rich dwarf locus than the one used before by @xmath82 , the background density becomes @xmath83 deg@xmath81 .",
    "typically , the photometric errors are larger at fainter magnitudes . since fainter leo  i rgb stars",
    "are bluer and closer to the dividing line between the giant and dwarf locus in the color- color diagram , the likelihood of dwarfs contaminating our giant selection is greater at fainter magnitudes .",
    "our very conservative selection of leo  i giant candidates gives us confidence that residual contamination will be very low .",
    "the low contamination level of our leo  i giant candidate list is illustrated by the upper panel of figure  [ f : spatialplot2 ] : no leo  i giant candidates exist in the large area east of ra @xmath84 10@xmath8522 , which suggests that the zero - level background is reached within our survey region .",
    "but this begs the question of the origin of the numerous , very widely separated leo  i giant candidates in the _ western half _ of our survey area .",
    "there are 26 candidates outside of twice the king limiting radius in our survey area ( all but four of them to the west of leo  i s center ) , but the background level derived above suggests that only about 3 - 4 of these stars should be contaminants .",
    "until we can obtain spectroscopy of these stars it is difficult to assess whether they are part of leo i ( as tidal debris ) , they are milky way contaminants , or some combination of both . tidal disruption models ( e.g.  6.1.2 . ) predict that stars released during the latest perigalactic passage are mostly spread out along the major axis of the satellite , and this could account for at least half of these spatial outliers .",
    "moreover , stars that became unbound during older perigalactic passages tend to be more irregularly distributed around the satellite ( see fig .",
    "it is therefore possible that many of the leo i giant candidates located far out from the main body could very well be unbound stars of the latter type .",
    "certainly the large scale inhomogeneity of the distribution is highly suggestive of substructure of some kind . nevertheless , because of the present ambiguous nature of these widely separated stars ,",
    "we have deliberately and conservatively elected to confine the remaining analyses in this paper to the central square degree around leo i.",
    "in this section , we present the results from profile fitting the two - dimensional distribution of leo  i giant candidates . a mass - to - light ratio of the bound population is calculated via the new set of structural parameters using the standard techniques of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we comment on newly identified , potential extratidal leo  i stars and also present isodensity contour plots of the leo  i system .",
    "structural parameters for leo  i were first derived by @xcite , and later by ih95 .",
    "all three studies used king profiles to fit their photographic observations .",
    "we use the positions on the sky of our giant candidates to explore the radial density profiles . to do so",
    ", we fit the surface density distribution of our leo  i giant candidates using two different models : the single - component king model and a power law + core ( plc ) .",
    "the fittings were done using a combination of bayesian and maximum likelihood techniques similar to that employed by @xcite .",
    "errors for each parameter were estimated using a bayesian approach in conjunction with a markov chain technique .",
    "the details of the fitting and error - estimating algorithms are described in @xcite . a single - component king model has been widely used to fit many dsph galaxies ( _ e.g. _ , ih95 ) .",
    "the plc model was adopted by @xcite to fit their ursa minor surface density profile .",
    "we describe our fitting method below in detail .",
    "several dsphs are found to have outer profile `` breaks '' ( i.e. slope changes ) from their central king profile density distributions : fornax and sculptor @xcite , carina @xcite , ursa minor @xcite , and sgr @xcite .",
    "although statistically insignificant , ih95 found an excess of stars with respect to their king fit in the outer region of leo  i. an excess of stars should show up in our radial density profile based on the appearance of stars spilled over from the main body of leo  i along the east / west in figure [ f : spatialplot2 ] .",
    "since a fit to a distribution of stars _ including _ the excess of stars in the outer regions will likely inflate the derived core and limiting radii , we have taken the following steps to find a new king profile fit : first , we limit the stars used to derive the structural parameters to those within @xmath86 from the center of leo  i in the east / west direction . next , six structural parameters ( ra and dec of the dsph center , position angle , core radius , ellipticity , and limiting radius ) are derived from this stellar sample . finally , the background level derived in  3.5 is combined with the six parameters to represent a newly fitted single - component king model .",
    "a similar approach was taken in the study of the sgr profile by @xcite .",
    "the plc model on the other hand was fit using the entire data set in one pass with the background level set to the same value used for fitting the king model .",
    "table [ t : structuralparams ] lists the best - fit parameters and errors for each profile .",
    "the first two lines in the table are for the new king and plc profile fits . for comparison",
    ", we also list the king profile parameters derived in earlier leo  i studies by @xcite , @xcite , and ih95 .",
    "the newly derived center of leo  i is at @xmath87 ( 10@xmath88 08@xmath89 28@xmath90.68 , + 12  18  197 ) .",
    "our derived core radius and ellipticity for either the plc or king profile fit are larger than those derived by ih95 , but are much closer to those of @xcite .",
    "similarly , our limiting radius is in better agreement with that of @xcite , although ih95 s limiting radius is also consistent within the errors . to illustrate how our new structural parameters better fit the sky distribution of leo  i giant candidates , the new king limiting radius",
    "is plotted over the sky distribution of leo  i giant candidates in figure  [ f : spatialplot_center ] ( compare to ih95 limiting radius size and shape in figure [ f : spatialplot2 ] ) .",
    "figure  [ f : spatialplot_center ] also shows the ellipse corresponding to the break radius ( @xmath91 ; see below for the determination of the break radius ) .    with the newly derived leo  i structural parameters ,",
    "we construct radial density profiles by calculating the number density of leo  i giant candidates in elliptical annuli of varying major axis radial size .",
    "although our coverage has small gaps from because of spaces between the mosaic ccd chips , our profile fitting program interpolates over them when doing any relevant calculation .",
    "figure  [ f : profiles]a shows the king model with structural parameters derived by ih95 overlaid on the giant candidate radial profile",
    ". figures [ f : profiles]b show our new king model and figure  [ f : profiles]c shows the plc profile fit .",
    "we now concentrate on the newly derived king model ( figure  [ f : profiles]b ) .",
    "the observed density profile clearly departs from the model beyond @xmath92 and this `` break population '' dominates the density out to the entire survey range even when uncertainties in both counting and background estimation are taken into account .",
    "such profile breaks are also seen in n - body models of tidally disrupting satellite galaxies @xcite . in these models ,",
    "the density profiles of the break populations typically assume power law shapes , @xmath93 . in figure",
    "[ f : profiles]b , we overplot power laws with @xmath94 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 in the range @xmath95 .",
    "as seen from the figure , our observed profile beyond the break point is not fitted well by a single power law , but instead the first three radial bins starting at and including the break radius follow a power law with @xmath96 , while the next three radial bins follow a power law density trend with @xmath97 .",
    "overall , a power law with @xmath98 best describes the surface density from the break radius to @xmath99 .",
    "it is worth noting that even for the plc fit ( figure  [ f : profiles]c ) , the observed density profile starts to depart from the model at @xmath92 .",
    "this indicates that the existence of the break population does not strongly depend on the choice of fitting models .",
    "the surface density profile of figure  [ f : profiles]b roughly remains flat in the range 35@xmath100 80 , and then drops to the background level beyond that .",
    "such a flat density distribution at large radii has not seen in the density profiles of other dsph galaxies . in",
    "we hypothesize that the complex form of the density profile might be attributable to specific patterns in the leo i mass loss history .",
    "ih95 found that fornax , sculptor , and ursa minor show asymmetric residual structure after a best - fitting , smooth elliptical profile has been subtracted from their two - dimensional distribution .",
    "figure  [ f : spatialplot_center ] gives some impression of an east - west inhomogeneity in the distribution of leo  i stars .",
    "to check this we plot in figure  [ f : profiles_eastwest ] the radial density profiles for the east and west halves of the galaxy , separately . in the inner five bins ,",
    "the western half has slightly higher densities , but at low statistical significance .",
    "the densities are then nearly identical out to the second break .",
    "for the next four bins after the second break , the western half is again higher in density and this corresponds to the excess stars to the west , just outside the limiting radius .",
    "nevertheless , the differences are within the poissonian errors and we conclude that the structural difference between the eastern and western halves of leo  i is of low significance",
    ". however , the fact that the breaks are seen independently in both east and west samples reinforces the reality of these structural features .",
    "if we use the king profile parameters in table [ t : structuralparams ] to represent the _ bound _ , part of leo  i , the bound mass can be estimated under the usual assumptions of virial equilibrium and the standard equation given by @xcite : @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the geometric mean of the king core radius ( @xmath103 ) in parsecs ( @xmath104 pc for leo  i ) , @xmath105 is the @xcite mass parameter , and @xmath106 is a velocity parameter which is related to the observed velocity dispersion .",
    "both @xmath105 and @xmath106 are strongly dependent on the concentration of a system @xcite . from the results in table [ t : structuralparams ] , the concentration of leo  i is @xmath107 .",
    "the scaling parameter @xmath105 was taken from an extrapolation of table ii of @xcite and @xmath106 from figure 4 - 11 of @xcite . the central velocity dispersion of @xmath108 km / s ( m98 ) yields @xmath109 ( see  5.5 ) only lowers the estimated leo  i mass by 14% . ]",
    "to obtain the corresponding luminosity , we integrate our best - fit model king profile for giant star candidates and scale it to the total luminosity using a central surface brightness of @xmath110 mag / arcsec@xmath14 taken from table 4 of m98 ; this yields @xmath111 .",
    "the @xmath9 using this technique thus becomes @xmath112 , where the error is from the uncertainty in the mass derived above .",
    "though we have used different structural parameters , we obtain nearly the same @xmath9 as m98 .",
    "we note that this @xmath9 is actually not that large compared to those typically found for dsphs , and is fairly similar to that of de galaxies and globular clusters of similar luminosity .",
    "as has been previously found ( m98 ) , leo  i has one of the lowest @xmath9 among the galactic satellites , though one that , by this method , still suggests a significant amount of dm .      in figure",
    "[ f : contourplots ] , we present the isodensity contour map of leo  i. this map was constructed using the leo  i giant candidates in the following manner : the equatorial coordinates of each star were first converted to a flat cartesian system via tangential projection centered at the newly derived system center . the cartesian space was divided into a large grid at intervals of 27 in each dimension .",
    "we then counted the number of stars in each grid interval to obtain the density for that part of the map .",
    "the gaps between the chips of mosaic ccd camera are 50 ccd pixels in the rows and 35 ccd pixels in the columns , corresponding to @xmath113 and @xmath114 in the sky , respectively . in order to check whether the absence of stars in the ccd gaps produce any artifacts in figure [ f : contourplots]a , we performed checks on our data as follows : first , we divided the ccd gaps into segments of 6  bins , and filled each bin with randomly placed artificial stars .",
    "the number of stars that went into each bin was calculated by taking the average of the number of leo  i stars on either side of the gaps in similar ra / dec ranges .",
    "once the gaps were filled , an isodensity contour plot was constructed using the exact same procedure as described above .",
    "we have also placed artificial gaps with same size as the real ones in random places and constructed several contour plots .",
    "only slight differences were found between the isodensity contours constructed in these ways and figure  [ f : contourplots]a .",
    "this ensures us that the influence of the ccd gaps on figure  [ f : contourplots]a is negligible .    in order to reduce the granularity from the griding process in our isodensity contour",
    ", we constructed a grid four times finer than the one used above , and replaced each star with a @xmath115 arcmin@xmath14 grid filled with a two - dimensional gaussian template ( @xmath116 arcmin ; amplitude = 1 ) .",
    "we assigned density to each pixel by counting up the numbers in a similar manner discussed above .",
    "the resulting smoothed image is shown in figure [ f : contourplots]b .",
    "overall , the inner contours of leo  i are similar to the isopleth map shown in ih95 ( see their fig .  1d ) .",
    "however , the spill - over of stars at the profile break radius is evident in the outer contours of figure  [ f : contourplots ] as contour extensions stretching out from the main body along the semi - major axis .",
    "it is important to note that the spatial density for the outermost contour in figure  [ f : contourplots]a is still higher than 600 times the background level derived in section 3.5 .",
    "we obtained spectra of a total of 135 stars in the leo  i field ; 49 stars lying just inside and outside the king limiting radius to the west of the leo  i center ( field kd1 ) , and 86 stars near the center and along the east major axis of leo  i ( field kd2 ) .",
    "the goals of our spectroscopic observations are ( 1 ) to check further the reliability of our color - color and color - magnitude selections discussed in  3 , ( 2 ) to verify the reality of the break population seen in the radial density profiles of leo  i ( see figure [ f : profiles ] ) , and ( 3 ) to study the dynamics of both the inner and outer parts of the leo  i dwarf .",
    "the spectra were obtained with observations of two multislit masks with the deep imaging multi - object spectrograph ( deimos ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on the nights of ut 2003 october 29 ( field kd1 ) and 2004 october 1518 ( field kd2 ) using the keck ii 10 m telescope ( see figure [ f : keckspec_spatialplot ] for the placement of our masks on the sky with respect to the leo  i giant candidates ) . the masks were designed using coordinates from our photometric catalog , which have been locked to the astrometric system of the usno - a v2.0 catalog ( see  2 ) .",
    "priority for slit selection was given to stars selected to be leo  i giant candidates by the criteria described in  3 .",
    "even for this priority sample , all stars falling within the 5@xmath19 16  slitmask area of field kd1 could not be observed because of slit overlap . on the other hand ,",
    "occasional gaps in mask area remained and these were filled with slits for , in priority order : ( 1 ) stars selected as giants , but not as leo  i giants , and ( 2 ) any other star in the field without regard to classification .",
    "observations of stars classified as dwarfs prove useful as checks on the reliability of the dwarf / giant separation .",
    "the spectrograph was configured with the 1200 lines / mm grating and 1slits with the central wavelength set at 7800 .",
    "this instrumental set up provides 0.33 / pixel dispersion , a spectral resolution fwhm of 1.95  ( 68 km s@xmath117 at the ca infrared triplet ) after accounting for the 0.7@xmath19 anamorphic magnification factor , and a spectral coverage of 65009100  ( which varies a little from slit to slit depending on their particular placement within the mask field of view ) .",
    "the total integration times were 80 minutes for field kd1 and 115 minutes for field kd2 , divided into four and five separate exposures , respectively , for cosmic ray removal .",
    "typical deimos spectra for different magnitude stars are shown in figure  [ f : specsample ] .",
    "the typical seeing during the leo  i spectroscopic observations were 08  10 .",
    "all steps of the data reduction to wavelength - calibrated , one - dimensional spectra ( including bias subtraction , flat fielding , sky subtraction , wavelength solutions , and extraction of 1-d spectra ) were done using the spec2d reduction pipeline ( cooper et al . , in prep ) developed at the university of california at berkeley for the deep2 galaxy redshift survey project .",
    "derivation of the radial velocity ( rv ) measurements uses a sequence of steps , each devised to address some aspect of noise suppression or bias compensation .",
    "combined , the resulting scatter in the achieved rv measurements can be shown to be less than 1/40 of the fwhm of a resolution element for the best exposed leo i stars .",
    "the first phase of the rv reduction follows the masked , fourier - filtered cross - correlation process outlined in @xcite and used in a number of our rv studies over more than a decade ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "briefly , each star is first fourier - filtered to attenuate frequency components lower than those given by the typical absorption line and higher than permitted by the intrinsic line resolution ( as might be introduced by cosmic rays , for example ) . masking multiplies a filtered spectrum in wavelength space with zero to suppress , or with unity to admit portions of a spectrum .",
    "mask wavelengths are selected according to several line lists that each serve specific functions .",
    "for example , an oh night sky emission mask multiplies all candidate data spectra prior to the correlation process to suppress possible residual noise due to imperfect night sky subtraction .",
    "another mask similarly multiplies filtered spectra prior to correlation to suppress telluric water and o@xmath71 bands when their strength at the instrumental resolution exceeds a few percent . finally , a third line list is used to mask the cross - correlation `` master template '' , which is set to zero everywhere except at low - ionization or low - excitation metallic or balmer features that , at the instrumental resolution and at mean target star signal levels , contribute a useful equivalent width component for a metallicity representative of the anticipated population ( in this case , leo  i ) .",
    "the suitability of features selected for inclusion in this last mask line list is decided from visual inspection of the arcturus atlas @xcite , which permits identification of satisfactory features as well as untrustworthy blends ( usually from line pairs of dissimilar elements ) for exclusion , and with reference to representative target star spectra to determine in a practical sense the visibility of the selected features .    in the specific case of our leo",
    "i reductions , our master cross - correlation template was based on the star 61788 in the kd1 mask , which was very well - exposed ( @xmath118 adu pixel@xmath117  roughly twenty times stronger than the weaker leo  i spectra ; see fig  [ f : specsample ] ) .",
    "this source was used as an rv template because no exposure of a more standard rv reference star was obtained , since the keck observations of leo  i were obtained only as a backup program for the deep project .",
    "the benefit of using this particular star as a cross - correlation template is its close match in spectral type and metallicity with the leo  i spectra .",
    "the disadvantage is that the true rv of this local reference is unknown , so the final rvs derived in the initial cross - correlation phase are subject to zero - point uncertainties , although their random errors are low .",
    "since the key dynamical descriptors of the leo  i population of relevance to our later analysis are based on _ relative distributions _ of rvs , any systemic rv offset present in the data does not explicitly affect our interpretations",
    ". the correction of systematic velocity offsets to a known velocity system can be achieved by accounting for offsets against telluric line references , as described below .",
    "in addition , we describe how we ultimately adjust to the zero - point of the m98 rv system in  5.3 , a necessary additional step if we wish to combine the two data sets .    in preparing star 61788 to serve as a cross - correlation template ,",
    "the masking procedure left predominantly the lines of the ca infrared triplet , as well as the stronger features of mg , fe , ti , ni , si , na , and h@xmath119 .",
    "these lines visible in the atmosphere of the star 61788 were preserved with the non - zero mask `` slats '' represented by a gaussian of unit amplitude and a width roughly 1.2 times the instrument profile .",
    "a total of 85 lines were used in cross - correlations using this masked template , with each slat having a fwhm of 3.0  for a total used spectral range of 255  over the full spectral range .",
    "experiments using slats of 2.5  and 4.2  yielded no significant variations in the quality of the cross - correlation results .",
    "as described above , before cross - correlation the other leo  i stars have been similarly fourier - filtered to the 61788 spectrum . to describe the quality of each cross - correlation",
    ", we have adopted the rv quality index @xmath120 , which is a descriptor of the shape of the central cross - correlation peak with respect to sideband peaks .",
    "values are assigned .",
    "] we note that although the meaning of the rv quality values are identical to those given in @xcite , the actual values of the cross - correlation peak ( ccp ) levels are on a relative scale that is only meaningful within the context of the present instrument set up .",
    "in general , only those rvs with @xmath121 can be trusted as reliable and we discard any star that does not meet this criterion in subsequent analysis .",
    "a primary limitation on the precision of rvs as just obtained is the non - uniform manner in which a spectrometer slit is illuminated , even when the star is perfectly centered in the slit .",
    "the presumption that a spectrometer slit is uniformly illuminated is true only the when illuminating source is uniformly spread over the portion of sky that the telescope is sampling . even in poor seeing a stellar point source , through spread over a angle with a roughly gaussian profile on the sky tends to illuminate the slit aperture ( along dispersion ) differently compared to the illumination from a lamp used to impose pieces of monochromatic light for wavelength calibration . to the extent that this difference appears perpendicular to the slit aperture",
    ", there is a displacement in the centroid of ( monochromatic ) stellar light along the dispersion compared with that of light from a uniformly illuminated source ( such as the sky or a calibrating lamp ) .",
    "the effects are obviously greatly amplified in the case that the star is _ not _ centered in the slit , whether due to random errors in the astrometry , imperfect tooling of the mask slits , and/or mask misalignment at the time of observation .",
    "the dispersion displacement varies with the circumstances of an exposure and can be determined only from signatures carried by the stellar signal itself .",
    "fortunately , the signature of this displacement is also imposed on absorption features originating from molecules of telluric o@xmath71 and h@xmath71o in the light path , and whose profiles and positions accurately track the mean integrated slit function of each particular star as passed through its slit .",
    "thus , the mean wavelength offsets in telluric features can be used to derive slit displacements on a star - by - star basis . to derive the telluric offsets we design a new cross - correlation mask in which all spectral features are blocked except the regions with the strongest telluric absorption features .",
    "the wavelength ranges upon which the telluric offset determination is based are 6866 - 6912   ( the fraunhofer b band ) , 7167 - 7320 , 7593 - 7690   ( the fraunhofer a band ) , 8110 - 8320 , and 8925 - 9120 , but all telluric features weaker than 20% were not used .",
    "a `` master '' template of telluric features was made from a fairly strong keck spectrum of a star with weak stellar features .",
    "unlike stellar features , the telluric features will look identical in all stars ( modulo the @xmath122 of their spectra ) , and so the dominant peak profile in cross - correlations with our masked telluric spectrum should appear the same .",
    "this was confirmed visually , and the lowest `` @xmath120 '' values we would assign to any of _ these _ cross - correlation peaks would be a `` 6 '' ; even stellar spectra with bad @xmath120 from the cross - correlation of _ stellar _ features still provide excellent telluric correlation profiles .",
    "we note that application of the offsets derived from cross - correlation of telluric features also corrects the original rvs for errors in the pixel - to - wavelength calibration and , in addition , places the rvs to an absolute reference .",
    "the heliocentric rvs corrected for these offsets ( with the additional zero - point correction to the leo  i systemic velocity as derived in  5.3 ) are given in column ( 8) of table [ t : keckspec ] , along with their ra and dec coordinates , @xmath123 magnitudes , @xmath124 and @xmath125 colors in columns ( 3 ) through ( 7 ) .",
    "we also list galactocentric standard of rest ( gsr ) rvs and a solar peculiar velocity of @xmath126 km s@xmath117 .",
    "] , telluric offsets , cross - correlation peaks ( @xmath127 ) , and quality index ( @xmath120 ) in columns ( 9 ) through ( 12 ) of table [ t : keckspec ] .    for those stars observed in 1  wide slits were actually alignment stars observed in 4wide slits .",
    "however , with the telluric offset corrections we can actually derive good rvs for these spectra with larger equivalent slit functions .",
    "the larger telluric offset corrections needed for these stars are evident in the tabulated values . ] , the mean telluric offset is @xmath128 km s@xmath117 with a dispersion of @xmath129 km s@xmath117 for those stars in mask kd1 and @xmath130 km s@xmath117 with a dispersion of 3.5 km s@xmath117 for those stars in mask kd2 . that both mean offsets are non - zero is a reflection of systematics in the original template derived from star 61788 ; that the mean offsets are different for each mask reflects the differences in positioning of each mask relative to their respective star fields . the 7.7 and 3.5 km s@xmath117 dispersions are respectively equivalent to @xmath131 and @xmath132 arcsec variations in the slit centering , and reflects the quality of the original astrometry ( see  2 ) , the slit manufacture and the _ rotational _ alignment of the slit mask on the sky .",
    "figure  [ f : teloff_position ] , which shows the telluric offset correction for both masks as a function of position along the mask ( approximately declination for mask kd1 and right ascension for mask kd2 ) , demonstrates however that the initial astrometric reduction contributes significantly to the star - by - star slit miscentering , given the clear correlations of the offset trends with the original ccd frame on which the star was originally photometered ( each ccd frame has a unique astrometric solution ) .",
    "the dispersions in the telluric offsets represent the actual precisions limits for multi - slit rvs in the case when the telluric offsets are _ not _ accounted for .",
    "after applying the telluric offset the velocity precision is therefore well better than this .      based on the relative strengths of the cross - correlations against the stellar and telluric templates , the dominant contribution to the rv errors are in the stellar absorption cross - correlation ; the telluric cross - correlation peaks are almost always much stronger than the kinematic correlation peaks , because the equivalent width of telluric absorption features sum to an order of magnitude larger than those intrinsic to the stellar atmosphere .",
    "errors in the stellar absorption cross - correlation are partly a reflection of differences in stellar line strengths between the template and target spectra .    an assessment of random sampling errors may be approached by a variety of techniques ; however , the method of @xcite is not one of them .",
    "the adopted cross - correlation methodology employed here differs from that of tonry & davis , having evolved over years of experience and motivated by the goal to cover as broad a range of ( generally unknown ) spectral types among the target stars as possible .",
    "the tonry & davis method relies explicitly on the characteristic that a template and a target spectrum must be of identical shape , or spectral type , so that the resulting cross - correlation ideally becomes an even function with null imaginary terms .",
    "then the imaginary terms that appear for real data may be utilized for the estimation of sampling errors . in contrast",
    ", our methodology , by using slat masking , maximizes the tolerance of the cross - correlation to widely variable spectral types , so that f through m stars have in the past been measured equally successfully to full precision in the same correlation process with a single template design .",
    "but such dissimilarities invalidate the reliance on the even character of the correlation function , and imaginary terms are generally non - zero even when sampling errors are rigorously zero .",
    "consequently alternate methods for estimating errors with our methodology are required .    to obtain a first estimate of the errors in our rvs",
    ", we repeated the stellar absorption cross - correlations twice with other rv templates manufactured from other stars in the leo  i masks with much stronger stellar absorption features than stars 61788 , namely stars 61736 , 61782 . with the cross - correlations",
    "there was little difference in the final results for the best quality target spectra , and there were only minor changes in @xmath120 values using different rv templates . for @xmath133 spectra the rms scatter in rvs was 1.2 km s@xmath117 .",
    "this rises to 3.0 km s@xmath117 when any one of the cross - correlation peaks dropped to @xmath134 .",
    "this analysis suggested an uncertainty scale of 1.2 , 1.5 , 2.0 , and 3.0 km s@xmath117 for stars with @xmath120 = 7 , 6 , 5 , and 4 , respectively .",
    "however , these uncertainties must be regarded as lower limits , since the use of different templates on the _ same _ target spectra do not lead to completely statistically independent measurements .",
    "because repeat observations of our target stars are not available , an alternative error estimation derives from creating _ artificial _ `` repeat observations '' via the convolution of the raw , unfiltered candidate spectra with randomized poisson noise .",
    "practically , this is accomplished by using the original spectrum as a probability distribution function , whereby , at any wavelength , the envelope of the original spectrum defines the `` expectation '' of received source counts with respect to neighboring wavelengths . with each wavelength `` bin '' set to the resolution fwhm width",
    ", the spectrum can be repopulated with poisson distributed photon events , dropped in randomly with wavelength destinations weighted according to the expectation probabilities . to get a representative spectrum whose noise characteristics are like those of the raw data ( presuming a negligible contribution from read noise ) one keeps adding poisson events until the count of events equals that of the raw target spectrum . on average ,",
    "each wavelength bin in the new pseudo - spectrum retains the same amplitude , compared to neighbors , as the original spectrum , with modulation only due to poisson noise . when a number of pseudo - spectra are so rebuilt but arbitrarily scaled to a much stronger total photon count than the original spectrum signal strength , their cross - correlations with the template show zero velocity scatter , as one expects for strong signals .",
    "when , on the other hand , poisson distributed photons are dropped into each slat so that the overall mean exposure level of the pseudo - spectra are comparable to the observed spectrum , the scatter in the derived velocities is found to be identical to that obtained by re - observing the same star as many times .",
    "the above error estimation method was applied to a variety of leo  i spectra with the generated pseudo - spectra cross - correlated against the same rv template using the same masks . this procedure packages into one procedure a test of all aspects of the data processing stream , including all instrumental traits , as well as the design of the line - lists , template fabrication , etc . if we adopt test spectra near the _ low end _",
    "limit of signal levels , i.e. @xmath135 adu , we obtain dispersions of 1.55 , 1.77 , 2.87 and 4.91 km s@xmath117 for stellar feature cross - correlations in @xmath120= 7 , 6 , 5 and 4 spectra , respectively .",
    "obviously , better precisions are achieved for the large number of spectra with higher signal levels ; e.g. , for @xmath133 spectra , dispersions of 0.44 , 0.50 , 1.46 km s@xmath117 were obtained for signal levels of about 4200 , 2500 , and 1000 adu .",
    "independent tests of the telluric cross - correlations at these signal strengths lead to scatters of about 1.2 km s@xmath117 ( and significantly better for stronger spectra ) . adding these contributions in quadrature , and conservatively adopting the worst case ( i.e. low signal strength ) dispersions for each quality , leads to the following estimated uncertainties for stars with @xmath120 = 7 , 6 , 5 and 4 , respectively : 2.0 , 2.1 , 3.1 , and 5.1 km s@xmath117 .",
    "we adopt these as our velocity uncertainties for subsequent analyses .",

    "the stars with measured velocity @xmath141 km s@xmath117 are generally located within our primary giant selection region whereas the stars with lower velocities are not ; in particular , in the two - color diagram the lower velocity stars all fall along the elbow - shaped , dwarf star locus , suggesting these stars to all be relatively nearby milky way dwarfs . even more gratifying is that for those 96 stars selected to be leo  i giants using both the color - color and color - magnitude diagram and for which we obtained rvs , _ all _ of them are leo  i members by the rv criterion ; this suggests that the _ reliability _ of our selection is very good , and we emphasize that _ a significant portion of our sample includes stars selected in the very low density outer parts of the leo  i system _ ( see figure  [ f : keckspec_spatialplot ] ) .",
    "we also observe that our leo  i giant candidate selection criteria are on the conservative side , because nine additional stars that we did not pick as giant candidates are also leo  i rv members . in most cases a slight expansion of our selection criteria would have picked up all but one ( see figure [ f : keckspec_crossid ] ) is likely to be an anomalous cepheid .",

    "the latter point is not simply due to the combined facts that we have used a tighter `` outlier '' definition for stars at large radii and that _ all _ of the stars in the western deimos mask are at large radii : in fact , there are still 11 stars to the east side of leo  i center with @xmath155 , but only one of these is an outlier by the above definition , compared to 9 outliers among 22 @xmath155 stars on the west side . of the 9 outliers to the west ,",

    "the rv outlier stars , when included , increase the dispersion outside the limiting radius to @xmath161 km s@xmath117 .    both the presence and meaning of velocity dispersion `` cold points '' near the nominal king radii of various dsphs has been debated recently @xcite .",
    "the reality of the phenomenon turns on how one deals with ( i.e. , includes or excludes ) apparent outliers and how one bins the data @xcite . in the present case , where the leo  i systemic velocity is so extreme , it is hard to believe that the outliers are anything but leo  i - associated stars , and so we are presented with a situation where the outliers and the dispersion characteristics demand an explanation within the context of a dsph structural model .    the lopsided nature of the rv outliers ( i.e. , that they tend to be outliers to the high rv side ) provides a significant clue to the nature of the outer parts of the leo  i dsph . were the rv outliers bound stars within a large leo  i dm halo ,",
    "it is hard to understand why they would not exhibit symmetrical dynamics  i.e. , a hot population of stars with members both approaching and receding relative to the leo  i core . the lack of any particular spatial concentration of the rv outliers ( other than tending to the west side of leo  i ) does not support the idea that the rv asymmetry is caused by a star cluster or `` dynamical fossil '' like that recently suggested to be `` sloshing back and forth within the '' dm halo of the ursa minor dsph @xcite .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "here we are presented with an apparent substructure evident both dynamically and spatially .",
    "a more natural explanation of the rv distribution is that the rv outliers and many of the stars outside the nominal king limiting radius represent stars that have likely been tidally stripped from leo  i , whereas the more dynamically cold component at the nominal leo  i systemic velocity seen at large radii represents the outermost reaches of the bound population of leo  i stars .",
    "the decreasing rv dispersion trend when the outliers are excluded suggests that we are seeing the tapering gravitational field of a leo  i apparently lacking an extended dm halo .",
    "moreover , the observed asymmetric rv distribution is naturally produced by tidal debris , as we show in  6.3 .",
    "a spectroscopic survey over a larger area would of course help clarify the dynamics of the outer leo  i system  in particular , spectroscopic observations at large radius on the _ eastern _ side of leo  i would provide particularly strong leverage on the tidal debris model , which would predict _ negative _ rv outliers to the east side of leo  i.",
    "the question of the origin of the apparently large @xmath9 in dsph galaxies remains one of the most vexing in local group research . while the presence of large amounts of dm is the most popular explanation ( e.g. , m98 ) , other proposals , including modified newtonian dynamics , tidal heating and/or disruption , dynamical resonances @xcite , and even the notion that dsphs are completely unbound @xcite",
    "have been proposed to explain the large velocity dispersions observed in the cores of the galactic dsphs .",
    "leo  i provides an interesting opportunity to revisit some of these mechanisms , because its large galactocentric distance and velocity implies that leo  i could only have had a few encounters with the mw center .",
    "tidal heating / disruption or resonance effects , if they occur , will have been limited to those that could organize and be sustained over only one or two perigalactica .",
    "because of this , leo  i offers the unique chance to gauge the importance of such effects on a per perigalacticon basis .",
    "in  4.2 we have rederived the @xmath9 of leo  i using standard core - fitting prescriptions and the central velocity dispersion .",
    "the results are not much different than previous findings , which suggest a modest dm component in leo  i compared to that in other dsphs .",
    "a primary point of this paper is to establish whether , independent of the net dm content of the dsph , it may have extended structure indicating that it is being tidally disrupted .",
    "we believe the weight of evidence suggests compellingly that leo  i has indeed been tidally disrupted and , moreover , that the derived king limiting radius approximates the true tidal radius in this particular system :    \\(1 ) we find a significant number of widely placed giant candidates associated with leo  i in our survey area ( see figure [ f : spatialplot2 ] ) , and with an especially pronounced density near the king limiting radius . while it might be argued that these stars represent a secondary , bound `` halo '' population around leo  i  perhaps tracing an extended dm halo  as can be seen in figure [ f : spatialplot_center ] the `` break population '' stars are more spread out along the east - west direction than in north - south in a manner that _ resembles _ tidal arms . in order to demonstrate the `` bipolarity '' of these outer stars more clearly",
    ", we divide the region outside the break radius of leo  i into azimuthal sectors of 18  in width and 17  in major axis radial length ( @xmath162 ) , and count the giant candidates in each sector , an orbital plot of our @xmath7-body simulations where we use different colors for stars that become unbound during different perigalactic passes .",
    "consequently , photometrically chosen dsph candidates located on degree scales away from the satellite s main body will not necessarily show a clearly defined tidal tail - like configuration .",
    "for this reason , we have limited our sample in @xmath146 when constructing the azimuthal sector count plot . ] .",
    "the counts were then normalized by the surveyed area in each sector to obtain the mean densities as a function of azimuthal sector presented in figure  [ f : azcount ] .",
    "as may be seen the `` arms '' are represented by two broad density peaks separated by @xmath163  to the east and west .",
    "a minimum in density is apparent to the north , but a corresponding minimum to the south is interrupted by the presence of a small peak at 145180  which originates from the bridge of seven stars extending to the southeast ( visible in fig .  [ f : spatialplot_center ] ) .",
    "whether this feature is a chance alignment of leo  i stars or a real dynamical structure may require high resolution velocity data to resolve , but we note that if these stars were a bit more spread out in pa , the `` minimum '' of `` beyond the break '' stars to the south would look similar to that of the north .",
    "overall , the stars beyond the break radius appear to be spread out more along the major axis than the minor axis , and have the appearance of a nascent tidal tail system .",
    "it is difficult to understand how the observed increasing ellipticity of the system would originate and be sustained in a dsph with an extended dm halo ; a very elongated luminous `` halo '' population with anisotropic velocity ellipsoid structure overlapping and extending beyond a second , more concentrated population with a rounder distribution would be implied .",
    "\\(2 ) our `` king+break '' radial density profile for leo  i is similar to the profiles observed in previous models of disrupting satellites as well as in the sagittarius dsph @xcite , an acknowledged example of a tidally disrupting satellite .",
    "\\(3 ) we have found a flat overall velocity dispersion profile for leo  i , a profile that is expected in the case of a tidally disrupting dsph ( @xcite ; muoz et al .",
    ", in preparation ) and is actually observed in the case of the tidally disrupting sgr dsph @xcite .",
    "while such profiles could also be formed in the presence of an extended dm halo @xcite , the detailed velocity distribution at large radius is not what is expected for the latter model , whereas it compellingly resembles ( fig .",
    "[ f : keckspec_hist_leoi ] ) a dynamically cold ( likely bound ) stellar population at the systemic leo  i velocity with a superposed population of unbound stars with larger velocity dispersion .",
    "\\(4 ) the _ asymmetry _ of the rvs of the outliers would seem to challenge the bound , extended halo population hypothesis , since in this model stars at a variety of orbital phases ( i.e. both approaching and leaving the apocenters of their internal orbits ) would be expected to yield a symmetrical velocity distribution . on the other hand ,",
    "such asymmetries are not only accommodated , but expected in tidal tail models ( as we show in  6.2 ) .",
    "we conclude that the most straightforward and natural interpretation for the observed leo  i structure and dynamics is that ( 1 ) it is tidally limited near the observed king limiting radius with the dwindling bound population creating a dynamically cold signature at its outermost extent , and ( 2 ) increasing numbers of unbound stars are being observed at larger radius and forming nascent tidal tails that contribute the rv outliers at large radius .",

    "more specifically , we seek to test whether a tidal disruption scenario can explain the observed ( 1 ) elongated dsph structure at radii comparable to and larger than the limiting radius ( i.e. the bipolar distribution of the break population ) , ( 2 ) shape of the overall density profile , ( 3 ) dispersion profile over all radii , and ( 4 ) the asymmetric rv distribution . a disrupting model that simultaneously accounts for all or even some of these features would not only lend support to a tidal disruption scenario , but ( as we shall show ) also provide the first real constraints on the orbit of leo  i.    the @xmath7-body simulation code we adopt has the same heritage as the @xcite mass - follows - light ( i.e. single component ) models .",
    "the static mw potential has a logarithmic , spherical ( @xmath184 ) halo with circular speed 210 km s@xmath117 .",
    "the assumed solar distance to the galactic center is 8.5 kpc and the total galactic mass within 50 kpc is @xmath185 m@xmath186 .",
    "other aspects of the potential are as in @xcite .",
    "the satellite is modeled by @xmath187 particles originally configured as a @xcite model , @xmath188 which has a physical scale length parameter , @xmath189 .",
    "the model is constrained so that the present satellite position and rv match those observed for leo  i : @xmath190 , a 259 kpc heliocentric distance , and galactocentric velocity ( @xmath191 ) of 180 km s@xmath117 . however , because the proper motion of leo  i is unknown , this is a free parameter that ultimately determines the shape of the model leo  i orbit . after assuming a given present proper motion , the leo  i orbit ( with the satellite as a point mass )",
    "is evolved back in time long enough to derive the phase space position of the satellite two apogalactica ago .",
    "the point mass is then replaced by the plummer model satellite at this phase space position ( after the satellite has been allowed to evolve and relax at infinite distance ) , and a full @xmath7-body simulation is evolved forward to the present time . in general , for the models tested here the start of the simulations occurs about 1112 gyr ago .",
    "in the course of the modeling efforts for leo  i , some 100 differently configured models have been run .",
    "initial models were run to fix a likely orientation of the orbit , under the assumption that the east - west position angle of the leo  i ellipticity and the orientation of the `` break population '' are caused by tidal effects and tidal stripping , respectively .",
    "@xmath7-body simulations were run with the satellite having an orbital pole every 45  along its allowed set of poles ( its  great circle pole family  ; see * ? ? ?",
    "it was found that a satellite with orbital pole near @xmath192  yielded tails with the proper orientation , though this simulation can not be discriminated ( on the basis of the direction of leo  i s stretching alone ) from one with a satellite having an opposite orbital pole ( i.e. [ 302 , -13 ] ) .",
    "we adopt either of these antipodal orbital poles for the remaining simulations , which thereby fixes the position angle of the present leo  i proper motion to @xmath193  or @xmath194  in galactic coordinates .",
    "the remaining simulation variables we explore are the initial satellite mass and scale ( @xmath189 )  which determine the size and density of the satellite and therefore the degree of satellite disruption  and the magnitude of the proper motion  which determines the properties ( eccentricity , peri - and apogalacticon ) of the orbit and also affects the degree of satellite disruption . given the extreme distance and rv of leo  i , it seems probable that leo  i has a rather elliptical orbit @xcite .",
    "thus , our modeling efforts centered on orbits with perigalactica ranging from 10 kpc to 50 kpc ( and consistent with the observed rv of leo  i ) ; despite the large variation in perigalactica , this actually corresponds to orbital eccentricities ranging only from 0.80 to 0.96 . with such orbits",
    "leo  i has an orbital period of about 6 gyr .",
    "it is found that after fixing the satellite mass to of order that found in  4.2 , a scale of @xmath195 kpc yields a final leo  i satellite with a tidal radius of order the observed leo  i king limiting radius .",
    "thus , we adopt models with this general structure , and explore how varying the orbit shape is reflected in the resultant radial light profile and velocity distribution . for the latter ,",
    "we `` observe '' radial velocities sampled from the model distribution in a spatial `` footprint '' mimicking that of the keck deimos spectra as shown in figure  [ f : keckspec_spatialplot ] ; this gives the most direct and fair comparison to the observed rv distribution seen in figures [ f : keckspec_hist ] and [ f : vdprofile ] .",
    "it is found that a variety of simulations of leo  i on an eccentric orbit can reproduce not only the overall `` king+break '' radial light profile that is characteristic of disrupting satellites @xcite , but also an asymmetric rv distribution and a more or less flat velocity dispersion profile like that observed . to fine tune the model",
    ", we took account of three general correlations in turn ( see @xcite ) : ( 1 ) the central velocity dispersion directly reflects the adopted satellite mass .",
    "( 2 ) the size of the observed `` king profile '' part of the satellite is set by the initial plummer model scale @xmath189 .",
    "( 3 ) with mass and scale set by the previous conditions , the mass loss rate ( hence the size of the break population ) is then only driven by the orbital shape ( i.e. impact parameter to the mw ) . following these general guides ,",
    "a narrow set of mass , scale and orbital shapes were found to give reasonable matches to the observed leo  i properties .",
    "the density and rv properties of two of these `` matching '' models are compared against the data in figure  [ f : nbody_profiles ] , and their three - dimensional orbits are shown in figure  [ f : nbody_orbit ] .    the parameters and results for adopted models are listed in table [ t : modelparams ] .",
    "models 111 and 117 have been run in the mw potential for 12.0 gyr and 11.8 gyr , respectively . in both cases",
    "the net mass loss is modest , with only 16% and 23% of the initial mass being unbound after 12 gyr .",
    "we note that the implied mass loss rates for both models roughly match the estimates made in  6.1.2 . as found in previously published simulations of satellite disruption ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the break populations in the extreme orbit , leo  i model satellite density profiles are also found to be due to tidal disruption ; this is shown in figure  [ f : nbody_profiles ] , where stars that are still bound as well as those that have been lost and become unbound on each of the last two radial orbits are marked with separate symbols and colors .",
    "thus , our original supposition that the observed leo  i break population may be due to unbound stars is supported by the models .",
    "however , the relative density at which these breaks occur does not match that of the leo  i density profile if the beginning of the unbound debris is associated with the inner of the two radial profile breaks . said another way , these models provide a good match to all the leo  i data if the first break in the radial density profile is considered as statistically insignificant or structurally unrelated to unbound tidal debris .",
    "even if the latter suppositions are not valid , we contend that these models still provide as good or a better simultaneous match to the overall observed structure _ and _ dynamics of any specific dsph than has been offered before .    we also attempted to find a model that could accommodate the inner density law break . since the relative density at which tidally induced",
    "break populations occur is directly related to the instantaneous rate at which debris is being generated , in order to match the relative position compared to the central density of the inner break at higher density we need to increase the mass loss rate of the satellite .",
    "this can be done by decreasing the satellite density .",
    "figure  [ f : nbody_highbreak ] shows the properties of model 122 which has an initial mass of @xmath196 m@xmath186 , a scale of 0.55 kpc and apo : perigalacticon of 450:10 kpc .",
    "whereas the position of the model break is now matched to the inner of the two observed density breaks , the model satellite is found to be three times larger than the actual leo  i , and the velocity dispersion as well as the overall density profile are no longer a good match .",
    "we therefore find model 122 to provide a less satisfactory description of leo  i than models 111 and 117 .",
    "the final satellite masses for models 111 and 117 ( see table [ t : modelparams ] ) are consistent with the leo  i mass derived from core fitting in  4.2 within the errors .",
    "the implied current total leo  i mass - to - light ratio from the models is @xmath197 .",
    "this lower @xmath9 than found in  4.2 implies a relatively small dm content , and would bring leo  i in line with the @xmath9 typical of de galaxies and even globular clusters .",
    "it is important to recognize that we have obtained a good match to the leo  i rv asymmetry with both of the preferred models _ even though this observed property was not used as a model constraint_. that such a result comes naturally lends further confidence to the plausibility of our models .",
    "the rv asymmetry in the models arises from the long extension of the trailing tidal arms towards the inner galaxy ( and the observer ) seen in figure  [ f : nbody_orbit ] and for which the innermost parts have a significant projection along the line of sight in models 111 and 117 .",
    "however , the degree of that projection , and therefore the velocity spread of the asymmetry is obviously tied with the eccentricity of the orbit .",
    "this can be seen , for example , by the results ( fig .",
    "[ f : nbody_hist ] ) of a series of models run with the same mass and scale , but more circular orbits than shown in figure [ f : nbody_orbit ] . as figure",
    "[ f : nbody_hist ] shows , less eccentric orbits have less asymmetry in their observed rv distribution .",
    "in addition , as might be expected , these models give poorer matches to the radial density and velocity dispersion profiles . in this way",
    ", the observed rv distribution can apparently directly constrain the detailed _ shape _ of the leo  i orbit , and by direct comparison to the observed rv distribution , we deduce that leo  i has an orbital eccentricity similar to that shown in figure [ f : nbody_orbit ] .",
    "we also deduce the general _ direction _ of the model 111/117 orbits ( i.e. the general direction of the proper motion ) to be correct ( i.e. to the east ) , since a satellite with a similar eccentricity orbit but opposite orbital pole yields the opposite rv asymmetry for our keck spectroscopy mask footprint ( fig .",
    "[ f : keckspec_spatialplot ] ) .",
    "this is demonstrated by the model results shown in the right - most panel in figure  [ f : nbody_hist ] .    finally , because we have shown by the models that stars in the break population",
    "are well described as nascent tidal tails , and by the analysis in  6.1.1 we have shown the leo  i break population lies predominantly east - west , we conclude that the orbital pole of @xmath198  is approximately correct . thus , based on the apparent discriminatory power of the figure [ f : nbody_profiles ] parameters as well as the direction of the tidal arms , we conclude that the orbit shown in figure [ f : nbody_orbit ] to be a reasonable approximation to the true leo  i orbit .",
    "a check on the orbit will obviously be delivered by the measurement of the leo  i proper motion , which can be expected in a decade or so from a key project ( led by srm ) of nasa s space interferometry mission .",
    "the expected current proper motions for leo  i are predicted to be @xmath199 and @xmath200 mas yr@xmath117 , respectively for models 111 and 117 ( including solar motion , which is assumed to have a 232 km s@xmath117 revolutionary speed about the mw , and additional peculiar motion of 9.0 and 7.0 km s@xmath117 in the galactic radial and @xmath201 directions , respectively ) .    in the meantime , verification of the overall picture painted by our model fitting here , including the orbit , can be made by obtaining more rvs on the _ east _ side of leo  i. our models predict that at large radii on the east side of leo  i an asymmetry of the rv distribution should be observed _ opposite _",
    "( i.e. , toward lower rvs ) that we have found to the west",
    ". the change in the sense of asymmetry arises from the sampling of the _ leading arm _ of the leo  i tidal tails on the east side , whereas our western rvs have been sampling trailing arm debris . mapping the leo  i tidal tails to larger angular separations",
    "would also provide significant leverage on the leo  i orbit and mass loss history .",
    "figure  [ f : nbody_orbit ] suggests that quite long tails should exist for two orbits of mass loss .",
    "however , the problem is quite observationally challenging because the tails are at fairly low surface brightness and the corresponding densities of leo  i tidal tail giant stars will eventually become quite sparse .",
    "a search for the main sequence turn - off cmd feature for the leo  i tidal arms near the satellite will require reaching to @xmath202 over large areas . from the ground , such work",
    "is severely hampered by the difficulty of star / galaxy separation at these magnitudes ( d. martinez - delgado , private communication ) .",
    "the provenance of leo  i has important implications for the mass of the mw .",
    "the high rv of leo  i at 259 kpc translates to a large implied lower limit to the escape velocity of the mw if this satellite is bound .",
    "if leo  i has made two orbits about the mw , as assumed in our models , then it must be bound .",
    "if it has made only one perigalactic passage , leo  i could still be bound to the mw , having _ become _ so on the last orbit ; however , in this case leo  i may also be unbound and on a hyperbolic orbit .    unfortunately , it is not clear that we can , with certainty , establish whether two or only one orbits have occured .",
    "according to the models , much of the unbound debris observed near leo  i has detached in the last orbit ( see fig .",
    "[ f : nbody_orbit ] ) . to verify whether any differences can be discerned between a one and two orbit leo  i , we ran a simulation ( model 118 ) with the same satellite and orbital properties as model 111 , but where only one radial orbit has occured ( i.e. the model is started 4.3 gyr ago )",
    ". figure  [ f : nbody_1orbit ] shows that the radial density profile from such a simulation is virtually indistinguishable from the two orbit model 111 .",
    "this is because of the small contribution of older debris to the density of leo  i _ over the currently observed area_. on the other hand , this small contribution does become more obvious in its influence on the observed _ velocity dispersion _ , as seen in the bottom panels of figure  [ f : nbody_1orbit ] : the one orbit model has a smaller velocity dispersion at large radii compared to that of the two orbit model , where older debris helps inflate the dispersion .",
    "the latter , two orbit dispersion profile is a closer match to that observed for leo  i , and so , based on this evidence alone can we tentatively suggest that a two orbit model is favored for leo  i.    the star formation history of leo  i may lend circumstantial support to the two orbit scenario . models 111 and 117 suggest that leo  i endured fairly substantial tidal shocking both @xmath203 and @xmath204 gyr ago .",
    "this general orbital picture seems to coincide with the star formation history of leo  i studied by @xcite , who finds that most of its star formation activity occurred between 7 and 1 gyr ago .",
    "the oldest ( @xmath205 gyr ) leo  i population , discovered by ( * ? ? ? * blue hb stars ) and , likely formed as a result of the initial collapse of gas that led to the formation of leo  i. the `` major '' star formation that started @xmath206 gyr ago is roughly timed with the previous perigalactic passage in our model ( see also models by mayer et al .",
    "we can only speculate as to the causes of the abrupt drop in star formation at @xmath203 gyr ago .",
    "leo  i may have simply ran out of gas to fuel the star formation .",
    "the absence of gas in leo  i @xcite is consistent with this picture .",
    "the coincidence that leo  i passed through the inner galaxy about this time ( and possibly with a rather small impact parameter ; fig .",
    "[ f : nbody_orbit ] ) may also suggest gas stripping by the mw disk or perhaps by a dense high velocity cloud .",
    "a massive ( @xmath207 ) fragmented cloud structure around leo  i @xcite perhaps indicates that the gas has been perturbed by tidal shocking .",
    "nevertheless , something triggered star formation at a time that matches well the timing of the first perigalacticon in our two orbit model , and , together with the velocity dispersion data , our results support the hypothesis of z89 that leo  i is bound to the mw and has had two radial orbits in this state .",
    "if leo  i is bound , a large mw mass is implied .",
    "the total mass of the mw within @xmath208 kpc from the center in our simulations is @xmath209 m@xmath186 , and it has a profile yielding a mass interior to 50 kpc that is consistent with those found in the analyses by z89 , @xcite , and @xcite when these analyses include leo  i as a bound satellite .",
    "verifying the length of the leo  i tidal tails would verify whether it has had multiple orbits around the mw and is thus bound . obviously , a definitively measured proper motion for leo  i would also help determine the true orbit of leo  i and refine the mass of our galaxy .",
    "what do our results say about the origin of leo  i ?",
    "first , it is probable that a hyperbolic orbit for leo  i would produce similar results ( over the sky area we have surveyed here ) to those seen for a single orbit , bound model .",
    "moreover , such an orbit will have an overall shape not dissimilar in overall orientation and general direction to the last orbit of models 111 and 117 , and thus we may determine from which direction leo  i approached the mw in this case .",
    "interestingly , in either the one orbit ( bound or hyperbolic ) or two orbit case , our modeling seems to rule out any close association of leo  i with m31 over relevant timescales to tidal stripping : ( 1 ) in the bound case , figure  [ f : nbody_orbit ] shows that leo  i is not in the vicinity of m31 ( which has current mw coordinates of @xmath210 kpc ) since approximately two orbital periods ago , and even then the inferred distance between m31 and leo  i is @xmath211 kpc ( and this ignores the motion of m31 over a hubble time ! ) .",
    "( 2 ) in the hyperbolic case , leo  i would have apparently entered the local group in an orbital plane almost perpendicular to the direction of m31 ( i.e. , from the general direction of the last apogalactica shown in figure [ f : nbody_orbit ] ) . were the @xcite hypothesis that leo  i was once bound to m31 to be true , it would have had to have been released from m31 at least @xmath212 gyr ago .    finally , we add a note of caution about interpreting the potential shape of the leo  i orbit as inferred or extrapolated from figure [ f : nbody_orbit ] , which represents a model run in a _",
    "static _ mw potential .",
    "obviously , currently favored hierarchical galaxy formation models imply a continuing growth of the galactic potential with time , and this will alter the orbits of satellites . on the other hand ,",
    "the mw formation models of @xcite suggest that destroyed satellites contributing mass to the mw halo accrete predominantly before the last two postulated leo  i perigalactica ( i.e. , before 7 gyr ago ) . thus , at least over this timescale , a static mw approximation , and the resulting figure [ f : nbody_orbit ] orbit , may be appropriate descriptors .",
    "moreover , as recently shown by @xcite , tidal streams respond adiabatically to evolving potentials , so that even if the mw potential evolved over the past 7 gyr or so , the leo  i tidal stream visible today would resemble that derived in a static mw potential with the present day mass profile .",
    "we have photometrically surveyed a 4.5 degree@xmath0 region centered on leo  i in the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 filter system in order to explore the extended morphology of this dwarf spheroidal galaxy , which is currently regarded as the most distant of the known galactic satellites ( unless the more distant phoenix system is bound to the mw ) .",
    "the photometric data were used to select leo  i giant candidates based on the two criteria : ( 1 ) the gravity sensitive ( @xmath213 , @xmath214 ) diagram , which separates distant giant stars from contaminating , foreground , metal - rich disk dwarfs , and ( 2 ) cmd positions commensurate with the temperature  apparent magnitude combination of stars on the leo  i giant branch .",
    "the background level of our `` leo  i giant star '' sample is determined to be small , and a 100% reliability in the identification of bona fide leo i giants is found via testing with a total of 133 stars in the leo i field with previously published or new keck spectroscopy .    we derive a new set of leo  i structural parameters by fitting a single - component king profile to the leo  i giant candidates . coupling this to the central velocity dispersion we have measured (  5.5 )",
    ", we use core - fitting techniques to derive a mass for the leo i system of @xmath215 and a total @xmath216 of 4.6@xmath217 , values not too dissimilar from previous study using the same technique ( m98 ) .",
    "the two - dimensional distribution of leo  i giant candidates shows many giant stars outside the derived king limiting radius .",
    "these are primarily along the major axis and spectroscopy of a subsample of these `` extratidal '' stars shows they are actually associated with the dsph .",
    "this population of stars shows up as a break at a major axis radial distance of @xmath6 arcmin in the radial density profile .",
    "our new keck spectroscopy confirms this excess of stars beyond the king limiting radius to be made of true leo  i members .",
    "our leo  i velocity dispersion profile shows a flat and then rising trend at large radii .",
    "we also find that the leo  i rv distribution , particularly for stars at large angular separations ( which in our data are primarily to the west side of leo i ) , includes a population of stars with a broad and skewed , asymmetrical distribution toward positive rvs overlapping a second , very much colder population at the nominal leo  i mean velocity .",
    "we interpret these features as support for a picture wherein leo  i has been tidally disrupted on at least one , but at most two , perigalactic passages by a massive local group member ( most likely the mw for both ) , and find these phenomena naturally produced in mass - follows - light @xmath7-body simulations of a tidally disrupting leo  i analog in a milky way - like potential .",
    "the best - matching @xmath7-body simulations to both the observed structural morphology and velocity distribution of leo i are those where the tidally disrupting satellite is on a rather high eccentricity ( 0.930.96 ) , small perigalacticon ( 10 - 15 kpc ) , bound orbit around the milky way , and has a present total @xmath218 . these best fitting model masses are 5885% the @xmath9 derived from the central velocity dispersion and core fitting , but it is not unreasonable to presume that the latter method yields somewhat inflated masses because of systematic increases in the true dispersion due to astrophysical processes such as the presence of binaries and the atmospheric jitter common to giant star atmospheres .",
    "thus , the likely @xmath9 of the satellite is rather modest and not unlike those of other elliptical systems of approximately similar mass scale that are typically regarded as low in , or devoid of , dm ( de galaxies and globular clusters ) .",
    "because of the rather close match between our model results and observations , and because disrupting satellites on highly radial orbits appear to yield great discriminatory power in this regard , we have been able to constrain the likely orbit of leo i _ without the measurement of its proper motion_. the orientation of the current satellite orbital plane can be fixed by matching model tidal tails to the predominant direction of the observed break population ( i.e. , more or less along the major axis ) , whereas we find that the _ direction of angular momentum _ in this orbital plane is well constrained by the sense of the rv asymmetry we have observed to the west side of the satellite .",
    "our models demonstrate that a positive rv asymmetry in the models is produced by _ trailing _ tidal debris for the receding satellite .",
    "thus , we predict that an opposite rv asymmetry will be found on the east side of leo  i from leading tidal debris . such a result would provide an important verification of the tidal disruption model we have put forward in this paper .",
    "our observed leo  i rv distribution is most consistent with a two mw orbit history for leo  i , with both orbits around the mw , however we can not yet definitively rule out a one orbit scenario .",
    "however , whether leo  i is bound to the mw or on an unbound , hyperbolic orbit around the mw , our results seem to rule out a leo  i orbit that includes a previous association with m31 within the last 10 gyr , in contradistinction to the @xcite scenario of a relatively recent origin of leo  i from m31 .",
    "leo i has long played a `` spoiler '' role in setting the mass of the mw because of its huge @xmath219 lever arm in jean s equation - based determinations using tracer particles of unknown proper motion ( i.e. unknown orbit size and shape .",
    "the large implied escape velocity at leo  i s distance implies large mw masses if leo  i is bound to our galaxy ( z89 , @xcite ) , although its influence on the mass determination is lessened when more complete samples of objects with complete phase space data are employed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "our observed rv distribution for leo  i slightly favors a two perigalacticon pass , bound mw orbit for leo  i , thereby suggesting that higher mass estimates for the mw may be more correct .",
    "in general , our tidally disrupting mass - follows - light satellite models provide a quite satisfactory match to the observed properties of leo  i , but a few details  namely the apparent double break in the density profile and the density at which the inner of these breaks occur  we have yet to account for in these initial modeling efforts .",
    "nevertheless , we contend that the scenario of a tidally disrupting , low @xmath9 system on a highly radial orbit provides a rather complete explanation for the observed properties of leo  i. while some properties of leo  i and other dsphs ( e.g. , flat velocity dispersion profiles and break populations ) have also been explained by postulating that these systems are embedded in extended dm halos , such an explanation in the case of leo  i appears less compelling in that it can not account for as many of the observed properties of the system ( e.g. , the asymmetry in the rv distribution and increasing ellipticity with radius ) . in contrast",
    ", tidal tails by now provide a well - established observational paradigm for dsph satellites , with the sagittarius dsph the most vivid example .",
    "we contend that the tidal disruption of sagittarius is not unique and that leo  i may be another example of the phenomenon , albeit at a much lower mass loss rate commensurate with a satellite on such an extreme orbit .",
    "tidal disruption observed among both the closest and farthest of the milky way satellites suggests that this process may be ubiquitous , and that similarly structured satellites with elliptical orbits and distances between these two examples might also be expected to be experiencing tidally induced mass loss , likely with an intermediary range of mass loss rates .",

    "<S> we present a wide - field ( 4.5 deg@xmath0 ) photometric and spectroscopic survey of the leo  i dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxy to explore its extended morphology and dynamics . as in previous papers in this series , we take advantage of photometry in the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 filter system to select leo  i red giant branch star candidates , and , so far , this selection technique has proven 100% reliable in selecting actual leo  i members among more than 100 @xmath4 leo i giant candidates having previous or new keck deimos spectroscopy to a radius @xmath5 times the limiting radius of the fitted , central king profile . </S>",
    "<S> the two - dimensional distribution of all similarly - selected leo  i giant candidates is well fitted by a central single - component king profile of limiting radius 13.3 arcmin , but many giant stars are found outside this newly derived king limiting radius . </S>",
    "<S> the density profile thus shows a break at a major axis radial distance of @xmath6 arcmin produced by an excess of stars at and beyond the king limiting radius ( spectroscopically confirmed to be made of true leo   i members ) , and primarily along the major axis of the main body of the rather elongated satellite . </S>",
    "<S> this spatial configuration , a rather flat velocity dispersion profile and an asymmetric radial velocity ( rv ) distribution among the leo  i members at large radii together support a picture where leo  i has been tidally disrupted on at least one , but at most two , perigalactic passages of a massive local group member . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate this hypothesis using mass - follows - light , @xmath7-body simulations of satellites in a milky way - like potential that reproduce the observed structural and dynamical properties of leo  i remarkably well . </S>",
    "<S> these models include @xmath8 solar mass , tidally disrupting dsph systems on bound orbits with rather high eccentricity ( 0.930.96 ) and small perigalactica ( 10 - 15 kpc ) . </S>",
    "<S> the simulations allow the first observationally constrained orbit for leo  i _ without the measurement of its proper motion _ and show that the observed rv distribution is more consistent with a two milky way orbit history for the satellite while ruling out a leo  i orbit that includes a previous association with m31 within the last 10 gyr . </S>",
    "<S> given the overall success of tidally disrupting mass - follows - light satellite models to account for the observed properties of leo  i , we conclude that there is no need to invoke an extended dark matter halo around the satellite ( e.g. , as one explanation of the velocity dispersion and radial profiles at large radii ) , and that an overall modest @xmath9 for the satellite is consistent with the available data . that a satellite on such a large ( apogalacticon of @xmath10 kpc ) , long period ( @xmath11 gyr ) orbit as leo  i can experience tidal disruption suggests that similarly structured satellites with even smaller ( eccentric ) orbits will experience even greater tidally - induced mass loss rates . </S>"
