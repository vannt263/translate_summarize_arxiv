    "these properties provide the initial conditions for star - formation .",
    "one crucial method to trace the evolutionary status of the parental molecular cores is to investigate their density structures .",
    "theoretical studies by shu et al .",
    "( 1987 ) have proposed the collapsing core model known as the `` inside - out collapse model '' .",
    "initially hydrostatic cores , with the density distribution of @xmath12 of a singular isothermal sphere , will dynamically collapse from the center with an expansion wave which propagates outward at the sound speed , @xmath13 .",
    "this infalling envelope has the size of @xmath14 at the given time , @xmath15 , and shows a density structure of @xmath16 . for the alternative semi - analytical isothermal similarity solution for the collapse ( larson 1969 ; penston 1969 ) , the compression wave propagates inward at the sound speed , reaching the center at @xmath17 . at @xmath18 , this wave is reflected as an expansion wave , and propagates outward with the sound speed , @xmath13 .",
    "the density structure of this collapsing core is the same as for the inside - out collapse case , although the absolute value of the density is higher than the equilibrium case ( 4.4 times denser for the larson - penston solution ) .",
    "a number of prestellar- and protostellar - cores have been studied using infrared extinction maps and millimeter / submillimeter emission images toward low - mass star - forming regions ( e.g. , ward - thompson 1994 ; ward - thompson 1999 ; andre et al .",

    "it has been suggested that the observed density structures of low - mass protostellar cores are roughly consistent with those predicted by either the inside - out collapse model or the isothermal sphere model with the density profile @xmath20 or @xmath21 . on the other hand , observed prestellar cores show a shallower density power - law index ( i.e. , flattened density profile ) at the core center .",
    "this can be explained if ( i ) the core is not sufficiently evolved to have reached the isothermal sphere density profile ( i.e. , t@xmath220 case in the larson - penston case ) , ( ii ) other mechanism such as a magnetic field could support the system ( e.g. , crutcher et al .",
    "1994 ) , or ( iii ) the core has a density structure explained by a finite - sized bonner - ebert sphere ( e.g. , bonnor 1956 ) .",
    "a large sample of these studies is one of the crucial strategies for understanding the initial conditions of the star - forming core as well as investigating the evolutionary status of the central stars .",
    "in particular , high - resolution observational studies with a spatial resolution of much less than 1000 au are necessary to constrain the radius where the density profile steepens and to compare this with the theoretical model for the very early stages of protostellare cores .",
    "such higher angular resolution studies are still limited in number .",

    "* at least two orders of magnitude higher volume density , @xmath139 @xmath11 , as compared with the other omc-2/3 continuum sources , was suggested toward mms 6-main .",
    "the internal structure of mms 6-main roughly agrees with an isothermal dusty core with a power - law index of @xmath1402 .",
    "we note that the density structure with @xmath1402 continues up to the @xmath64-distance of 80 k@xmath38 , which corresponds to the linear size of @xmath94450 au . assuming that the upper limit of the infalling radius is @xmath94450 au , the upper limit of the protostellar age is estimated to be @xmath427.6@xmath310@xmath137 yr , while the free - fall time scale of the core is estimated to be @xmath141 yr from the average dust density .",
    "both timescales are roughly consistent with each other , and the estimated timescale is extremely short as compared with the typical time scale of the class 0/i protostars which is @xmath9 yr .",
    "this suggests that mms 6-main is probably in the pre - stellar phase or a transition phase from the pre - stellar to the proto - stellar evolutionary stage .",
    "an unresolved component was suggested from the gaussian fitting of the 3.3 mm and 0.9 mm data with an upper limit to the mass of 0.21.0 @xmath1 .",
    "the alternative power - law density fitting would not require such a compact component .",
    "longer baseline data with a @xmath64-distance more than 80 k@xmath38 are necessary to constrain the inner most structure .    due to the lack of even higher angular resolution , sensitivity , and an appropriate molecular tracer",
    ", we could not directly measure the physical properties of the 100 au scale circumstellar disk or the possible central protostar .",
    "sma and vla observations with higher angular resolutions and also future alma observations will reveal the internal structure of mms 6-main with a size - scale down to several au .",
    "high angular resolution data of h@xmath0o masers could be useful for searching for the very beginning of the mass ejection phenomena ( i.e. , the micro - jet ) from the central protostar such as for the s106 fir case ( furuya et al .",
    ". moreover , polarization observations with higher spatial resolutions can be useful for elucidating the magnetic field structure at this early evolutionary stage .",

    "1998 ; saigo 2006 , 2008 ) will also be important .",
