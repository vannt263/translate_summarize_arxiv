    "the unphysical nature of this divergence is clear since the gauge - invaraint curvature perturbations , i.e. @xmath44 , is regular for both modes .",
    "assuming a precise knowledge of the thermal history of the universe from the planck energy scale down to photon decoupling , then , definite predictions on the cmb observables can be made . to make the predictions more definite , it is wise to assume that the field content during inflation is rather limited",

    "this simple model is constrained by experimental data .",
    "more complicated models will be more constrained as soon as more accurate data will be available @xcite . when magnetic fields are consistently included in the pre - equality physics ,",
    "the issue of initial conditions becomes particularly important and it has been recently shown that different thermal histories can imply slightly different amplitudes of the curvature perturbations induced by a magnetized background @xcite .    in a pragmatic perspective",
    "it is plausible to start confronting with observations the simplest model . in the case of @xcite ,",
    "the m@xmath6cdm scenario is the simplest option since a magnetized adiabatic mode is assumed and the magnetic fields introduce only two new parameters in comparison with the @xmath6cdm paradigm .",

    "the magnetized cdm - radiation mode tends to reduce the amplitude of the tt power spectra in comparison with the case when the magnetic fields are absent .",
    "since the magnetized adiabatic mode and the cdm - radiation mode are both solutions of the truncated einstein - boltzmann hierarchy , also their combination will lead to a viable initial condition .",

    "the third requirement can be phrased in terms of any best fit ( also including other data sets , e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "this will not change our conclusions since , as far as cmb observables are concerned , different best fits lead to central values that are not crucially different for the present ( illustrative ) purposes . in fig .",

    "two different cases will then be considered :    * ad + nac+nab denotes the case where , on top of the magnetized adiabatic mode ( i.e. ad ) , the initial conditions include also two other non - adiabatic contributions which are chosen to be the magnetized cdm - radiation ( i.e. nac ) and the magnetized baryon - radiation ( i.e. nab ) modes derived , respectively , in eqs .",

    "[ figure5 ] , the excessive increase ( and distortion ) of the acoustic peaks induced by the bare magnetized adiabatic mode ( i.e. ad ) is compensated when the initial conditions are of the type ad + nac + nab . the nac contribution , as discussed in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] tends to compensate the increase of the peaks while the nab contribution acts on the phases ( see also fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] ) . as it is clear from the bottom - right plot of fig .",
    "[ figure5 ] the ad+nac+nab combination is even too effective in lowering the peaks .",
    "the inclusion of the neutrino - entropy mode moderates this trend by adding extra - power in the acoustic region .",
    "this effect arises since the neutrino - entropy mode has a different phase structure in comparison with the non - adiabatic mode of the cdm and baryon sector . from the different ranges of multipoles where",
    "the tt power spectra have been computed two opposite remarks seem to emerge :    * on the one hand the mixing of different magnetized modes in the pre - equality initial conditions seems to shade the effect of a ( pretty strong ) magnetic field ; * on the other hand the reported wmap error bars also suggest that the different cases can still be distinguished .    in the light of these remarks it is useful to consider the plots reported in fig . [ figure6 ] where the te and ee angular power spectra are illustrated .",
    "the sub - dominant non adiabatic components imply that the leading effect in the te anticorrelation peak is determined by the magnetized adiabatic mode . at the same time",
    "the sharp increase of the peaks in the te and ee spectra ( for high multipoles ) is partially compensated by the non - adiabatic components .",
    "for @xmath212 the distortions induced by the magnetized adiabatic mode can be reduced but not eliminated .",
    "the reported examples are , in our opinion , rather effective for motivating the approach pursued in the present research program which is directly linked to the possibilities of achieving accurate determinations of the temperature and polarization observables with the forthcoming planck explorer mission @xcite .",
    "a systematic approach in this direction is a necessary step for any quantitative strategy of parameter extraction involving large - scale magnetic fields .",
    "more than fifty years ago large - scale magnetic fields entered the scene because of the interplay with cosmic ray physics @xcite . today cosmic ray physics is again confronted with the relevance of large - scale magnetic fields to infer more fundamental conclusions on the nature of the observed fluxes of ultra - high energy cosmic rays @xcite . in the intervening lapse of time radio - astronomy has established that the largest gravitationally bound systems are all magnetized to various degrees .",
    "still the question remains : where do the observed fields come from ?",
    "the standard paradigm used to interpret the cosmological data , i.e. the @xmath6cdm model , does not contemplate the presence of a magnetized contribution very much in the same way as , in the pivotal @xmath6cdm mode tensors are absent .",
    "the increase in the quality of astrophysical observations will allow , in the near future , to include further parameters to the basic @xmath6cdm scenario .",
    "in @xcite we formulated a plausible extension of the @xmath6cdm scenario , i.e the magnetized @xmath6cdm model ( m@xmath6cdm ) . in the minimal m@xmath6cdm model the cmb initial conditions are simply dictated by the magnetized adiabatic mode where no entropic modes are allowed . in the present paper the minimal m@xmath6cdm model has been extended to the case of magnetized initial conditions with entropic components .",
    "the spirit of the present investigation is , at once , modest and conservative : we just want to bring the treatment of magnetized cmb anisotropies to the same standards which are typical of the cases where large - scale magnetic fields are absent .",
    "the problem with this plan is that specific numerical tool have to be developed . unlike more standard additions to the @xmath6cdm paradigm ( which are customarily included in the standard codes )",
    "large - scale magnetic fields demand dedicated numerical approaches which , so far , did not exist .",
    "the proof of this statement is that , before the present analysis , we did not know , for instance , the effects of large - scale magnetic fields on the various non - adiabatic modes contemplated in the standard cmb initial conditions .    in the present paper",
    "the initial conditions of magnetized cmb anisotropies have been derived in a generalized perspective .",
    "the analysis has been conducted both analytically on the truncated form of the einstein - boltzmann hierarchy .",
    "the cmb observables have then been numerically computed for each single set of initial conditions to emphasize the relevant shape effects .",
    "the addition of the magnetic field is not able to change the sign of the first peak of the te correlations so that we can safely conclude that a single magnetized non - adiabatic mode is not compatible with the experimental observations .",
    "the same sharp statement can not be made , however , if the initial conditions of the truncated einstein - boltzmann hierarchy are given in terms of a superposition of modes where the dominant amplitude is provided by the magnetized adiabatic mode .",
    "the examples provided in this paper suggest that a thorough analysis of the tt , te and ee angular power spectra allow , in principle , to distinguish the signatures of different magnetized initial conditions . in the near future",
    "we plan to pursue our program by sharpening those theoretical tools that might allow for a direct observational test of the effects of large - scale magnetic fields on cmb anisotropies .",
    "while we are aware of the theoretical challenges associated with this effort , the potential relevance of the whole strategy justifies our endeavors .",

    "the evolution equations of the truncated einstein - boltzmann hierarchy will be illustrated in the tightly coupled regime which is the relevant one to set initial conditions . for reasons of convenience",
    "the language of the synchronous gauge will be adopted .",
    "similar equations discussed either in different gauges or in dedicated gauge - invariant formalisms can be usefully found elsewhere @xcite .",
