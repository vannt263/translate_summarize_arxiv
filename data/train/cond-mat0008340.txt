    "among the hydrogen - bonded ferroelectrics , the compound kh@xmath0po@xmath1 ( kdp ) has been the most intensively studied over the second half of the last century.@xcite however , a detailed knowledge about its ferroelectric phase transition and some related phenomena is still lacking . in particular , its transition temperature ( t@xmath7 @xmath8 122k ) , shows an increase of about 107k upon deuteration .",
    "the origin of this huge isotopic effect is still controversial . in the sixties ,",
    "blinc and zecks proposed a quantum tunnelling model to explain it , which focuses purely on mass - dependent effects.@xcite improvements of this model include coupling to vibrations of the k - po@xmath1 complex.@xcite experimental studies over the past fifteen years , especially high - resolution neutron difraction measurements,@xcite provided increasing evidence that the geometrical modification of the hydrogen bonds upon deuteration , the well - known ubbelohde effect,@xcite is intimately connected with the mechanism of the phase transition .",
    "have shown that the distance @xmath9 between the two collective equilibrium positions of the protons is remarkably correlated with t@xmath7.@xcite they proposed that @xmath9 might be the only relevant parameter for t@xmath7 and , in addition , no concluding evidence of tunnelling was established .",
    "it was then suggested the necessity of a revised theory for this class of transitions .",
    "recently , a phenomenological model was proposed , which couples , via geometrical details of the h - bond , the proton coordinate with a nonlinear dynamics of the k - po@xmath1 system , where the spontaneous polarization actually develops.@xcite this model , which includes both tunnelling and geometrical isotope effects , also allows to explain the t@xmath7 behaviour upon deuteration .",
    "summarizing , it appears well - established that , in this class of systems , proton ordering and geometrical and electronic properties of the host cage are connected in a non trivial way.@xcite so far , to the best of our knowledge , no _ ab initio _ calculations have been reported for kdp .",
    "this type of approach has the advantage of allowing a confident parameter - free analysis of the microscopic electronic and structural changes upon proton ordering that drive the ferroelectric transition .",
    "to this end , we have performed density functional ( dft ) electronic structure calculations @xcite for kdp , within a gradient corrected approach to exchange and correlation , both in the tetragonal paraelectric phase ( forcing the protons to be in the center of the h - bonds ) and in the orthorhombic ferroelectric phase , where the protons order cooperatively at off - center positions in the h - bond .",
    "we thus analyzed in detail the structural parameters and the microscopic electronic density redistributions associated to the proton ordering phenomenon , which eventually provoke the ferroelectric instability .",
    "this work is organized as follows : in section 2 we describe the methods and the details of the calculations .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the analysis of the geometry results . in section 4 ,",
    "we study and discuss the polarization mechanism produced by the off - centering of the hydrogen atoms along the h - bonds , and its relation to the ferroelectric instability .",
    "finally , in section 5 we elaborate our conclusions .",
    "we have performed two different types of _ ab initio _ calculations .",
    "first , we have used a recently developed , very efficient localized basis ( lb ) set approach ( siesta ) .",
    "this is a fully self - consistent , pseudopotential dft method that employs a basis set of pseudoatomic orbitals ( pao).@xcite we have chosen a double - zeta basis set with polarization functions ( dzp ) .",
    "the exchange - correlation energy terms were computed using the perdew - burke - ernzerhof gradient - corrected functional.@xcite angular - dependent , norm - conserving troullier - martins pseudopotentials @xcite were employed to represent the interaction between ionic cores and valence electrons .",
    "we have also included nonlinear core corrections ( nlcc ) for a proper description of the k ion , due to the large overlap of core and valence charge densities .",
    "we used a 125 ry energy cutoff for the grid computation of numerical integrals @xcite , and a value of @xmath10 mev for the orbital confinement energy , which gives total energies and geometries of sufficient accuracy for this system . due to the approximate character of these confined basis orbitals",
    ", we have checked the overall accuracy by performing standard pseudopotential plane wave ( pw ) calculations",
    ". the parallel version of the car - parrinello sissa fpmd code @xcite , and the same set of pseudopotentials , exchange - correlation functional , and nlcc were used . the energy cutoff for the plane wave expansion",
    "was set to 150 ry . in both approaches , the electronic brillouin zone sampling reduced to the @xmath11-point , which is a reasonable approximation for such a wide band gap insulator .",
    "we have , however , checked that this sampling is sufficient for the large supercells considered .    in the paraelectric phase , the kdp structure ( space group i@xmath122d )",
    "has a body - centered tetragonal primitive lattice . for our calculations , we used instead the conventional face - centered tetragonal cell ( space group f@xmath12d2),@xcite which includes 64 atoms ( 8 formula units ) . with this choice",
    ", the transformation to the orthorhombic structure of the ferroelectric phase is simply described by a change in the ratio of the basal plane lattice parameters , in addition to changes in the internal structure parameters .",
    ".comparison of the ab - initio ( lb and pw ) lattice parameters and internal coordinates with experimental data .",
    "the notation is the same used in the experimental works referred .",
    "the different cases considered in the calculations are explained in section 2 .",
    "we defined @xmath13 as the displacement of the k atom along z , respect to its centered position between p planes .",
    "distances are in    and angles in degrees . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     cell relaxation  from fp@xmath14 to gs  also affects the internal structure ( table 1 ) . as h approaches o2 , @xmath9 increases , the o1@xmath2h bond weakens and the h - o2 bond becomes stronger . as a consequence , a larger amount of charge localizes around o1 , and delocalizes away from o2 .",
    "this behavior is related to the pm and will be useful to establish a connection between @xmath9 and the charge difference @xmath15 .",
    "moreover , we observe a striking correlation between @xmath16 , the distortion of the tetrahedra , @xmath17(p - o ) @xmath18 , and the displacement of the k atoms , @xmath13 .",
    "these trends are shown in the theoretical curves in fig . 2 for two different values of @xmath9 , obtained from the cell - unrelaxed fp@xmath14 and the gs calculations .",
    "the crucial experimental observation that the effect of isotopic substitution can be almost exactly reproduced by applying pressure @xcite , supports the idea that the main effect of deuteration is to modify the internal geometry . in this sense",
    ", our calculations for fp@xmath14 and gs , corresponding to two different pressures , can be used to analyse isotopic effects .",
    "it is known from experiment that h(d ) ordering , @xmath13 , @xmath17(p - o ) , and spontaneous polarization p@xmath19 , show very similar trends just below t@xmath7 , in the ferroelectric phase.@xcite moreover , these trends are quite well explained by the present pm ( left curves in fig .",
    "2 ) . therefore",
    ", it is natural to attempt to establish a connection between @xmath16 and structural data measured in kdp and in its deuterated analog , dkdp .",
    "this is done in fig .",
    "2 , by including the experimental values of @xmath13 , @xmath17(p - o ) and p@xmath19 for kdp and deuterated dkdp .",
    "the comparison between theoretical and experimental curves is very favorable , especially for what concerns the slopes of the curves.@xcite    in connection with the proposed pm , the above indicates that the enhancement of the saturated polarization due to deuteration , experimentally observed below t@xmath7 , @xcite can be explained merely by the increase in the charge unbalance between o1 and o2 ( @xmath16 ) , which in turn is induced by an increase in @xmath9 .",
    "this picture is in line with the ideas developed in ref.@xcite , where the experimental behaviour of p@xmath19 and the inverse dielectric constant were rationalized in terms of a proton - dipole interaction model .",
    "in fact , at temperatures well below t@xmath7 , the protons are strongly bound to the neighboring po@xmath1 dipoles , in a stable minimum of an asymmetric potential . in this asymmetric configuration ,",
    "the protons localize into the deepest well because the energy needed to be promoted to the excited state is too high , thus ruling out the possibility of tunnelling.@xcite in this case , deuteration can only induce the indirect effect of enhancing @xmath9 @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ the so - called geometric effect .",
    "preliminary _ ab initio _ calculations indicate , even more strikingly , that there is actually no double minimum structure in the potential energy surface for single protons .",
    "appart from supporting this scenario , the current _ ab initio_-derived pm establishes the importance of the short - range proton  ",
    "po@xmath1-dipole interaction for the transition , as was also speculated in @xcite .",
    "we presented the results of _ ab initio _ dft calculations for the h - bonded ferroelectric material kdp , which reproduce very well the structure of the tetragonal and orthorhombic ( ferroelectric ) phases in kdp . on this basis",
    "we identified the microscopic polarization mechanism that leads to the ferroelectric instability .",
    "this arises from an electronic charge redistribution between the oxygen atoms involved in the h - bonds , occurring when the protons move away from the center of the bonds .",
    "we indirectly showed that the interplay between proton ordering and ferroelectric polarization qualitatively explains the enhancement of the saturated p@xmath19 upon deuteration .",
    "in addition we provided , for the first time , fully _ ab initio _ evidence supporting the idea that isotope effects reduce , at least at low temperatures in the ferroelectric phase , to the _ indirect _ geometric effect of enhancing @xmath9 , as speculated in recent works @xcite .",
