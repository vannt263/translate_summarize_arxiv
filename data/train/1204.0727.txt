    ", we determine the dynamics of these singularities when a highly charged vortex in a bose - einstein condensate is struck by a symmetry - breaking impulse .",
    "specifically , we consider a dynamical situation in which a highly charged two - dimensional vortex is generated in an axisymmetric harmonic potential , and a symmetry - breaking potential is turned on transversely , i.e. , in the plane containing the vortex , for a very short period of time , such that it can be described by an impulse with a potential @xmath1 over a period of time @xmath2 .",

    "we obtain these trajectories analytically for the non - interacting case by utilizing the feynman propagator for a harmonic potential , and determine their validity in the weakly interacting case . in the non - interacting case",
    "we find that the parent singularity reconstructs itself from the daughter singularities after a period of time , i.e. , there is a full quantum revival.in the interacting case quantum revival is blocked in the mean field theory : repulsion prevents the highly charged parent from being reconstructed , hence describing a helical trajectory around the origin .",

    "in this section , we analyze the trajectories found previously to determine the effective forces acting on the singularities during and after symmetry - breaking .",
    "the equation of motion for the complex coordinate @xmath124 shows that the system undergoes nontrivial motion corresponding to a harmonic oscillator with complex and time - dependent frequency .",
    "this leads us the discovery of an effective singular force that causes the daughter singularities to initially repel . due to the complex nature of this effective potential ,",
    "we show that the system of vortices is non - conservative .",
    "we then describe the torque about the origin acquired by the singularities during symmetry - breaking .",
    "this torque arises as the product of the magnus force .",
    "now that we have expressions for @xmath125 and @xmath114 , we can find the equations of motion for the off - axis singularities . by taking the derivatives of @xmath125",
    ", we see that the velocity and acceleration in the radial component can be expressed as @xmath126 by taking the derivatives of @xmath114 , we see that the angular velocity is constant , @xmath127 , and therefore the angular acceleration is zero .",
    "however , the fact that there is an angular velocity at all tells us that the singularities have acquired a torque about the axis at some point in their creation and propagation .",
    "if we recombine @xmath125 and @xmath114 into the complex coordinate @xmath128 once again , we can study the behavior of the singularities immediately after symmetry breaking .    if we taylor expand equations and around @xmath129 , i.e immediately after symmetry breaking , we get @xmath130 and @xmath131 the previous expansions give us the complex coordinate @xmath132 right after symmetry breaking , such that @xmath133 we now proceed to derive the equation of motion associated to . if we differentiate with respect to @xmath134 , we see that @xmath135 a second derivative of will provide us with the equation of motion in complex notation : @xmath136 if we let @xmath137 , and @xmath138 , we can rewrite as @xmath139 evidently , the phase singularities experience a nontrivial type of force .",
    "the previous equation represents a special type of harmonic oscillator in which the frequency is both complex and time dependent .",
    "since the frequency is complex , we do not expect the system to be conservative .",
    "we can prove this statement by manipulating and its conjugate in the same manner we would do to establish conservation of energy in a standard harmonic oscillator .",
    "first , we write the conjugate of : @xmath140 next , we multiply by @xmath141 and by @xmath142 and add the two resulting equations to obtain @xmath143    we immediately recognize that the left hand side and the first term of the right hand side are total derivatives . if we rewrite the total derivatives , we get @xmath144 unfortunately , @xmath145 is time dependent , so we can not just combine the total derivatives .",
    "instead , we must subtract the term with @xmath146 .",
    "the total derivative of the @xmath145 term is @xmath147 this allows us to rewrite as @xmath148 if we replace @xmath142 and @xmath141 with their functional values , and evaluate the derivative of @xmath145 , we obtain @xmath149    if we define the energy of the system the same way we would a typical harmonic oscillator , @xmath150 it is clear that there is gain in the system .",
    "we can see the value of the gain by considering the derivative of the energy : @xmath151 thus , energy is not conserved by our equations of motion governing singularity or vortex motion .",
    "however , the gpe does conserve energy .",
    "thus energy is being exchanged between the singularities and the remainder of the bose - einstein condensate described by the full gpe .",
    "the presence of this effective harmonic motion explains why the post - symmetry breaking singularities expel from the origin .",
    "however , we still need to explain the effective torque that the singularities seem to experience . to understand this torque better , let us rewrite our complex coordinate in cartesian coordinates via the definition of @xmath152 .",
    "this gives us @xmath153 if we collect the real and imaginary parts , we arrive at @xmath154 we can write the previous equations in vector form as @xmath155 in order to see how a torque comes into our system , we need to rewrite the @xmath156 matrix term in three - dimensions ( 3d ) . to do this , we construct the external 3d vector @xmath157 such that @xmath158 where @xmath159 is the transverse plane and * i , j , k * are unit vectors , which we are working in .",
    "therefore , the equation of motion for phase singularities can be represented in 3d , although the motion is restricted to a two - dimensional plane @xmath160 .",
    "we write our 3d representation as @xmath161 this equation of motion shows the simultaneous presence of a harmonic force and an external force associated with a torque .",
    "the fact that the latter is associated with a torque can be checked by calculating its effect on the angular momentum of the phase singularity  @xmath162 .",
    "if we look at the derivative of the angular momentum , we see that @xmath163 if we evaluate this cross product using our expression for @xmath164 in , @xmath165 using the vector triple product @xcite , we obtain @xmath166 because @xmath167 is defined only to have a @xmath168 component , and our position vector is two - dimensional , the dot product of @xmath169 with @xmath167 vanishes , leaving @xmath170    finally , we arrive at @xmath171 the previous equation shows that the angular momentum has variance only in the @xmath168 direction , which means there is a torque that causes rotation in the @xmath172 plane , as we expect . because the value of the torque is negative , our singularities rotate about the origin in a clockwise manner , as our trajectories in sec .  [ sec : trajectories ] were seen to do in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] . in appendix",
    "[ sec : energy ] , we check that the calculation of the energy is correct using our 3d formalism .",
    "let us note that all of these results apply , when properly rotated , to any of the four phase singularities moving away from the center of symmetry .",
    "this is due to the four - fold symmetry of our solutions and it is reflected in the four solutions that we have for the angular coordinate @xmath114 in .      in sec .",
    "[ sec : randaeom ] we derived the equation of motion for the four phase singularities that arise immediately after symmetry breaking by a discretely symmetric impulse .",
    "we found that the breaking of rotational symmetry causes a vortex to cluster in a central singularity carrying topological charge equal to the angular pseudo - momentum @xmath30 and a  wave \" of @xmath3 ( @xmath3 being the order of symmetry of the impulse ) single charged phase singularities with particle - like motion moving away from the symmetry axis .",
    "the dynamics of these phase singularities as point - like particles is described by the equation of motion in ( for the case @xmath37 ) .",
    "this equation is very interesting because it shows that , despite the wave function describing the propagation of matter corresponds to linear harmonic propagation , the clustered phase singularities do not move as harmonic oscillators .",
    "in fact , right after the action of the impulse , they experience two types of forces , as described by the right - hand side of :    * a harmonic repulsive force given by @xmath173 . * a rotational force @xmath174 generating a torque @xmath175 .",
    "both forces have a peculiar behavior .",
    "let us analyze them separately .",
    "this effective potential is crucial because it is responsible for the dissociation of the initial highly - charged vortex with topological charge @xmath5 into the central singularity of charge @xmath38 and four vortices of charge @xmath42 .",
    "if the interaction was attractive , the four vortices would remain at the origin ( the center of symmetry ) since both the initial position and initial velocity are zero .",
    "however , we find that the interaction is repulsive because @xmath176 for small values of @xmath177 .",
    "nevertheless , a repulsive harmonic interaction is not enough to guarantee the motion of the broken singularities away from the origin since their position and velocity are initially zero .",
    "they would remain there in a situation of unstable equilibrium since the force upon them would be zero .",
    "something else is needed to trigger the expansive motion of the broken singularities .",
    "the mechanism is the existence of a nonzero , in this case singular , repulsive potential at @xmath178 .",
    "@xmath179 if we analyze the form of the effective harmonic potential for small values of @xmath177 , we see from that @xmath180 indicating the presence of a singular repulsive potential at @xmath178 .",
    "the curvature of the quadratic potential is , thus , infinite and negative right after the symmetry is broken , so the force on the escaping singularities is non - zero when they are located at the origin when @xmath178 .",
    "this singular potential is the reason why the singularities start to move away from the center of symmetry .",
    "the fact that the potential and force are singular at @xmath178 does not produce any issues in the velocity and position of the fleeing singularities when @xmath178 because the acceleration , which has the form @xmath181 has first and second integrals of the form : @xmath182 which are both finite at @xmath178 and compatible with the initial condition @xmath183 and @xmath184 when the constants are taken to be zero .",
    "as seen in , there is an @xmath185 dependence in the torque that the singularities experience around the origin once symmetry is broken .",
    "the torque is zero when @xmath178 since @xmath186 due to the initial condition of @xmath184 .",
    "thus , the singularities must start moving away from each other , making @xmath187 , before the external torque can take effect .",
    "this allows us to conclude that the singular repulsive effective harmonic potential acts on the singularities before they can acquire any angular momentum .",
    "as our vortices acquire a linear velocity away from the origin , they become subject to the magnus effect .",
    "this effect creates a force perpendicular to the direction of motion according to @xmath188 , where @xmath189 is a property of the medium the vortex is traveling through , @xmath190 is the angular rotational velocity of the spinning object , and @xmath191 is the linear velocity .",
    "this perpendicular magnus force causes the vortices to follow a curved path .",
    "if we evaluate the expression for the magnus force , we see that @xmath192 where the velocity vector was formed by taking the derivative of the position at small @xmath177 given in .",
    "if we evaluate the torque associated with the magnus force , we see that @xmath193 which is consistent with our expression for the torque found in the previous section with @xmath194 and @xmath195 , verifying that the torque associated with the singularities after symmetry breaking is generated by the magnus force .",
    "therefore , the dynamics of our singularities after symmetry breaking can be described as follows : first , the action of the symmetric impulse introduces an effective singular repulsive harmonic potential that splits @xmath37 single phase singularities out of the original highly charged vortex .",
    "as these singularities begin to travel away from the origin , they gain angular momentum from the effective external torque and rotate around the axis of symmetry .",
    "eventually , the effective harmonic potential is overpowered by the trapping potential , so the singularities travel back toward the origin , and settle into oscillatory motion about the origin . eventually , they fuse back to the origin and reconstruct the initial vortex for the non - interacting case only .",
    "we can also find an expression for the maximum radius the singularities achieve as a function of @xmath23 , given by @xmath196 confirming that the strength of the impulse directly affects the motion of the singularities .",
    "we can compare the calculated trajectories from section [ sec : trajectories ] with the actual minima of the wavefunction amplitude as well as numerical data generated by numerically solving the gpe  .",
    "to begin , we compare the analytic solutions with the actual minima of the wavefunction to determine the accuracy of the calculated trajectories for various impulse strengths .",
    "later , we compare the analytic trajectories , solved for a non - interacting bec , and compare them to the numerical data for the same symmetry - breaking process in a weakly interacting bec with various particle interaction strengths to determine the validity of our results in the nonlinear case .      to compare the analytic trajectories to their actual locations in the wavefunction , we must find a way to track the singularities . due to the non - analyticity of the wavefunction",
