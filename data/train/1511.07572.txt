    "einstein - podolsky - rosen steering @xcite , an intermediate type of quantum correlation between entanglement and bell nonlocality , has recently attracted renewed interest @xcite .",
    "steering is a quantum phenomenon that allows one to manipulate the state of one subsystem by performing measurements on the other entangled subsystem . after being realized by schrdinger @xcite ,",
    "the concept of quantum steering was studied by einstein , podolksy and rosen ( epr ) in their well - known 1935 paper @xcite , and was treated as the core concept of the epr paradox @xcite .",
    "the epr expectations for local realism were mostly extinguished by bell s theorems @xcite , which insisted that no locally causal theory can reproduce all the correlations observed @xcite .",
    "experimentally , at variance with the case of bell tests , a demonstration of steering free of detection and locality loopholes is in reach @xcite , which makes quantum steering a practically useful concept .",
    "the experimental detection of quantum steering , i.e. , for the demonstration of the epr paradox , was first proposed by reid @xcite .",
    "after which , several experiments were performed to demonstrate quantum steering and its asymmetry @xcite .",
    "recently , a number of studies are devoted to develop better criteria to detect steerable states @xcite , and analyse the distribution of steering among many body systems @xcite.most recently , kogias _",
    "@xcite proposed an operational measure of quantum steering for bipartite gaussian states of continuous variable systems .",
    "they found that for two - mode gaussian states , the quantum steering reduces to a form of coherent information and the asymmetry of steering can not exceed @xmath0 @xcite .    on the other hand , relativistic quantum information @xcite ,",
    "the study of quantum information processes and concepts in a relativistic setting , has been a blooming area of research for both conceptual and experimental reasons .",
    "understanding quantum phenomena in a relativistic framework is necessary because the realistic quantum systems are essentially noninertial .",
    "it was experimentally demonstrated that the gravitational frequency shift ( gfs ) effects have a remarkable influence on the precision of atomic clocks for a variation of @xmath2 m in height @xcite .",
    "in addition , relativistic effects of the earth notably affect satellite - based quantum information processing tasks @xcite and quantum clock synchronization @xcite .",
    "quantum information also plays a prominent role in the study of the thermodynamics and information loss problem @xcite of black holes .",
    "therefore , it is of great interest to study how relativistic effects influence the properties of quantum steerability @xcite in a curved spacetime .    in this work we present a quantitative investigation of gaussian quantum steerability for free bosonic modes in the background of an eternal schwarzschild black hole @xcite .",
    "we assume that alice and bob initially share a two - mode squeezed gaussian state with squeezing @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "alice is a kruskal observer who stays stationary at an asymptotically flat region ( or freely falls into the black hole ) , while bob is a schwarzschild observer who hovers near the event horizon of the black hole with uniform acceleration .",
    "alice and bob will not agree on the definition of vacuum state in each of their reference frames.a vacuum state observed by alice would be detected as a thermal state from bob s viewpoint . from a general relativity viewpoint ,",
    "the temperature @xmath4 of the hawking thermal bath depends on surface gravity @xmath5 of the black hole . in a quantum information scenario ,",
    "such a process can be described as a bosonic amplification channel acting on bob s quantum state @xcite .",
    "that is , from bob s viewpoint the accessible state is obtained by tracing over the modes inside the event horizon @xmath6 $ ] . here",
    "@xmath7 is a two - mode squeezing operator @xcite that encodes the state evolution under the effect of hawking radiation of the black hole , and @xmath8 is bob s input state.we will calculate the gaussian quantum steering @xmath9 , which quantifies to what extent bob s mode can be steered by alice s measurements , and the steering @xmath10 , to verify the asymmetric property of steerability in the curved spacetime .",
    "we also interested in the steerability tradeoff between the mode @xmath11 described by bob , and the complimentary mode @xmath12 described by a hypothetical observer anti - bob who moves in the interior region of the black hole.we find that the quantum steerability between alice and bob decreases with the increase of the hawking temperature parameter @xmath13 , while the the steerability between bob and anti - bob segregated by the event horizon is generated at the same time .",
    "we also find that the attainment of maximal steering asymmetry indicates the transition between one - way steerability and both - way steerability for two - mode gaussian states under the influence of hawking radiation .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we briefly introduce the definition and measure of bipartite gaussian quantum steering . in sec .",
    "iii we discuss how the unruh - hawking effects of the black hole can be described by a bosonic amplification channel acting on the covariance matrix of a bipartite system . in sec .",
    "iv we study the behavior of gaussian quantum steering and its asymmetry in background of a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "the last section is devoted to a brief summary .",
    "let us first briefly introduce the definition and measurement of gaussian quantum steering .",
    "we consider a continuous variable quantum system @xcite represented by @xmath14 bosonic modes of a bipartite system @xmath15 , composed of a subsystem @xmath16 of @xmath17 modes and a subsystem @xmath11 of @xmath18 modes . for each mode @xmath19",
    ", the corresponding phase space variables can be denoted by @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the phase - space operators @xmath22 can be grouped together into a vector @xmath23 , which satisfies the canonical commutation relations @xmath24",
    "= i{\\omega _ { ij}}$ ] , with @xmath25 being the symplectic form .",
    "any gaussian state @xmath15 is completely specified by its first and second statistical moments .",
    "the latter is a covariance matrix with elements @xmath26 $ ] and can always be put into a block form @xmath27 notice that the submatrices @xmath16 and @xmath11 are the covariance matrixes corresponding to the reduced states of alice s and bob s subsystems respectively.the covariance matrix @xmath28 tcan describe a physical quantum state if and only if ( _ iff _ ) it satisfies the _ bona fide _ uncertainty principle relation @xmath29    now let us give the definition of steerability .",
    "after alice performs a set of measurements @xmath30 , the bipartite state @xmath31 is @xmath32 steerable ( i.e. , alice can steer bob ) _ iff _ it is _ not _ possible for every pair of local observables @xmath33 ( on @xmath16 with outcome @xmath34 ) and @xmath35 , ( on @xmath11 with outcome @xmath36)to express the joint probability as @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "in other words , at least one measurement pair ( @xmath33 and @xmath35 ) is required to violate this expression when @xmath38 is fixed across all measurements . here",
    "@xmath38 and @xmath39 are probability distributions and @xmath40 is the conditional probability distribution associated to the extra condition of being evaluated on the state @xmath41 . , meaning that a complete knowledge of bob s devices ( but not of alice s ones ) is required to formulate the steering condition.it has been shown in @xcite that a general @xmath14-mode gaussian state @xmath31 is @xmath32 steerable by alice s gaussian measurements _ iff _ the condition @xmath42 is violated .",
    "henceforth , a violation of is necessary and sufficient for the gaussian @xmath32 steerability .",
    "one can define the gaussian @xmath43 steering to quantify how much a bipartite gaussian state @xmath28 is steerable by the measurements performed by alice @xmath44 where @xmath45 are the symplectic eigenvalues of the schur complement of a in the covariance matrix @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath43 steering vanishes _ iff _ the state described by @xmath28 is nonsteerable by alice s measurements , and it generally quantifies the amount of by which the condition ( [ nonsteer ] ) fails to be fulfilled .",
    "the gaussian steerability @xmath43 acquires a particularly simple form when the steered party bob has one mode only ( i.e. , @xmath46 ) @xcite @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the rnyi-@xmath49 entropy @xcite .",
    "similarly , a corresponding measure of gaussian @xmath50 steerability can be obtained by swapping the roles of @xmath16 and @xmath11 , resulting in an expression like eq .",
    "( [ gs1 ] ) . unlike quantum entanglement",
    ", the quantum steering is an asymmetric property @xcite : a quantum state may be steerable from alice to bob , but not vice versa . in a quantum information scenario",
    ", quantum steering corresponds to the task of entanglement distribution by an untrusted party @xcite .",
    "if alice and bob share a state that is steerable from alice to bob , then alice is able to convince bob ( who does not trust alice ) that their shared state is entangled by performing local measurements and classical communication @xcite .",
    "in this section we will show how the unruh - hawking radiation of the black hole can be described by a bosonic amplification channel @xcite , which is a gaussian channel .",
    "the spacetime background near a schwarzschild black hole is described by the metric @xmath51 where @xmath52 represents the mass of the black hole . throughout this paper",
    "we set @xmath53 .    in the background of the black hole",
    ", a massless bosonic field @xmath54 obeys the klein - gordon(k - g ) equation @xcite @xmath55 solving eq .",
    "( [ k - g equation ] ) near the event horizon , we obtain a set of positive - frequency outgoing modes propagating in the regions inside and outside of the event horizon @xmath56 @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 is the tortoise coordinate in schwarzschild spacetime .    eqs .",

    "the schwarzschild vacuum @xmath66 can be defined as @xmath67 ; therefore the modes @xmath68 and @xmath69 are usually called schwarzschild modes @xcite .    making an analytic continuation for eqs .",
    "( [ inside mode ] ) and ( [ outside mode ] ) , we find a complete basis for positive energy modes , i.e. , the kruskal modes , according to the suggestion of domour and ruffini @xcite .",
    "the kruskal modes can be used to define the hartle - hawking vacuum , which corresponds to the minkowski vacuum in flat spacetime .",
    "then we can quantize the massless scalar field in the schwarzschild and kruskal modes respectively @xcite , and can obtain the bogoliubov transformations @xcite between the modes and operators in different coordinates .",
    "we hope to describe a scalar field mode in kruskal coordinates as a combination of schwarzschild modes which are observed by a accelerated observer bob who hovers outside the black hole .",
    "however , as performed in @xcite , an inertial observer alice has the freedom to create excitations in any accessible mode @xmath70 .",
    "hence , one can not map a single - frequency kruskal mode into a set of single frequency modes in schwarzschild coordinates @xcite . to avoid this obstacle ,",
    "we employ the unruh basis which provides an intermediate step between the kruskal and schwarzschild modes .",
    "the relations between the unruh and schwarzschild operators take the form @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath5 is the surface gravity of the black hole which relates the hawking temperature @xmath4 of the black hole by @xmath73 .",
    "such modes are purely positive - frequency combinations of standard plane waves in kruskal coordinates , but enjoy a special property : they are mapped into single frequency modes in schwarzschild coordinates .",
    "although they have been shown to suffer some pathologies ( delocalisation and oscillatory behavior near the acceleration horizon ) that might hinder their physical realization @xcite , one can in principle design plausible models of non - point - like detectors which couple effectively to a single unruh mode @xcite .    a generic schwarzschild fock state @xmath74 describing both particles and antiparticles can be written as @xmath75 sign denotes the particle and antiparticle respectively .",
    "this allows us to write the unruh vacuum as @xcite @xmath76 is a shortcut notation used to underline that each unruh mode @xmath77 is mapped into a schwarzschild mode @xmath77 .",
    "one - particle unruh states are defined as @xmath78 , @xmath79 where the unruh particle and antiparticle creation operators are defined as linear combinations of the two unruh operators @xmath80 and @xmath81 where @xmath82 satisfy @xmath83 .",
    "the operator @xmath84 indicates the creation of a pair of particles @xcite , i.e. , a boson with mode @xmath77 in the exterior region and an antiboson in the interior region of the black hole .",
    "similarly , the create operator @xmath85 means that an antiboson and a boson are created outside and inside the event horizon , respectively .",
    "hawking radiation comes from spontaneous creation of paired particles and antiparticles by quantum fluctuations near the event horizon.the particles and antiparticles can radiate randomly toward the inside and outside regions from the event horizon with the total probability @xmath86 .",
    "in this situation , @xmath87 means that all the particles move toward the black hole exteriors while all the antiparticles move to the inside region @xcite ; i.e. , only particles can be detected as hawking radiation . if we fix @xmath88 and assume that bob has a detector sensitive only to the particle modes , eq .",
    "( [ vacuumba ] ) reduces to @xmath89 and can be described by a bosonic amplification channel @xcite .",

    "hereafter we write @xmath93 as @xmath13 for convenience .",
    "it is worth noting that the squeezing transformation @xmath94 is a gaussian operation , it will preserve the gaussianity of the input states .",
    "therefore , if the input state @xmath90 is a gaussian state in eq .",
    "( [ stator2 ] ) , the output state @xmath95 in schwarzschild coordinates would remain gaussian.a symplectic phase - space representation of the two - mode squeezing operation @xmath94 has the form    @xmath96",

    "it is shown that the @xmath50 steering is always bigger than the @xmath43 steering and avoids  sudden death \" with the increase of @xmath13 , which indicates that the inertial part steers the noninertial part is easier than the noninertial part to steer the inertial part . from fig .",

    "that is to say , thermal noise introduced by the hawking effect will destroy the steerability between an inertial and an accelerated observer .",
    "however , the steerability between two observers segregated by the event horizon of the black hole is generated due to the effect of hawking radiation .",
    "it is found that the steering from alice to bob suffers from a  sudden death \" and the steering from anti - bob to bob experiences as sudden birth with the increases of hawking temperature , which is quite different from the behavior of quantum entanglement in accelerated setting @xcite and curved spacetime @xcite .",
    "it is intriguing to find that the steering is always asymmetric and is endowed with a maximum steering asymmetry for a fixed @xmath13 , and that the maximum steering asymmetry can not exceed @xmath0 in the curved spacetime .",
    "it has been shown that @xmath1 is a critical point of steering asymmetry under the influence of hawking radiation .",
    "in addition , the parameters attaining the peaks of steering asymmetry are obtained when the @xmath43 steering experiences  sudden death \" or the @xmath132 steering experiences  sudden birth \" .",
    "that is to say , the attainment of maximal steering asymmetry indicates a transition point of the two - mode gaussian state in the schwarzschild spacetime .",
