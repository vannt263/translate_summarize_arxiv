    "most young stars in our galaxy formed within groups or clusters ( lada and lada 2003 ) .",
    "small , nearby groups of protostellar objects provide compelling cases for investigating the physical processes involved with such formation since the numbers involved are relatively small ( e.g. , @xmath5 @xmath6 10 ) and the interactions of these objects with themselves and their environments are less complicated . for example , observational study of kinematics associated with young stars within groups and their immediate dense gas surroundings could provide evidence for a specific formation scenario , e.g. , fragmentation or triggering , that is easier to see because of the simpler nature of groups relative to clusters .",
    "kinematic study of the gas surroundings of protostellar objects is achieved through observation and interpretation of molecular rotational transitions , since line profiles can be shaped by the motions within the source gas ( see di francesco et al .",
    "2006 for a review . ) for example , outflow motions from young stellar objects were first seen in the low - intensity wings of co 1@xmath30 emission ( e.g. , snell , loren & plambeck 1980 ) . in addition",
    ", rotational motions in dense cores have been suggested from the detection of the shift of centroid velocities along different lines of sight in optically thin molecular transitions ( e.g , .",
    "goodman et al . 1993 ) . finally , infall motions in dense cores have been the interpretation of profiles of moderately optically thick lines that are asymmetric with a stronger blue peak relative to optically thin lines ( e.g. , zhou et al . 1993 ; myers , evans & ohashi 2000 ) . such kinematic evidence has come primarily from single - dish telescopes , i.e. , of relatively low spatial resolution , in studies of isolated protostellar objects . for protostellar groups ,",
    "however , the surface density of objects can be high , and single - dish telescopes may not have the resolution needed to associate kinematics with particular protostars within the group .",
    "instead , data from interferometers are very highly suited for such studies , especially when used in tandem with data from single - dish telescopes .",
    "the use of molecular lines to study kinematics is complicated by potentially significant molecular abundance variations along the lines of sight toward dense gas both before and after star formation .",
    "such abundance changes can be due to chemical evolution , intertwined with the yso luminosity evolution since luminosity affects the temperatures of nearby dust grains that interact with gaseous molecules ( see rawlings & yates 2001 ; doty et al .",
    "2002 ; lee , bergin & evans 2004 ) .",
    "of course , yso luminosity evolution is itself intertwined with dynamical evolution of the surrounding gas , as much of the luminosity originates from accretion .",
    "hence , a holistic approach in general is required that includes luminosity , dynamics and chemistry , to understand best the environments from which stars form ( see bergin et al .",
    "1997 and aikawa et al .",
    "2001 for early examples of such models ) .",
    "located at 300 pc @xmath7 50 pc ( kun & prusti 1993 ) , l1251b is an excellent example of a small , nearby group of protostellar objects where molecular line observations can probe the kinematics and chemistry of its environment and yield clues about its origins .",
    "l1251b is located within l1251e , the densest c@xmath0o core in l1251 ( sato et al .",
    "l1251b is associated with a single iras point source , iras 22376 + 7455 , and was found associated with co outflow by sato & fukui ( 1989 ) . in lee",
    "( 2006 ; paper i ) , we showed via single - dish data that iras 22376 + 7455 was associated with a local maximum of submillimeter emission , although significant peaks of 850 @xmath8 m emission were also seen @xmath4150  to the east .",
    "in addition , we showed spitzer space telescope ( sst ) observations of the region that revealed @xmath420 ysos within @xmath41 pc@xmath9 covering l1251b and its surroundings , indicative of the formation of a group of low - mass stars .",
    "within l1251b itself , these data revealed three class 0/i objects ( irs1 , irs2 , and irs4 ) and three class ii objects ( irs3 , irs5 , and irs6 ) , within a projected diameter of 55 .",
    "( no near- or mid - infrared sources were found to be associated with other locations of submillimeter emission adjacent to l1251b . ) finally , we showed submillimeter array ( sma ) continuum observations of l1251b in paper i that revealed two compact locations of high column density between irs1 and irs2 that may be starless condensations .",
    "paper i revealed clearly l1251b as a region of recent ( and possibly continuing ) star formation within a small group .    in this paper , we examine line emission associated with l1251b and the core @xmath4150  to its east ( henceforth , the  east core \" ) , to probe kinematic and chemical processes in the region .",
    "the three embedded class 0/i sources and two starless objects within l1251b are especially emphasized ; irs1 is the most luminous object , irs2 is located southeast of irs1 and is associated with a near - infrared bipolar nebula , and irs4 is located at the west of irs1 .",
    "the two starless objects are named as sma - n ( the northern one ) and sma - s ( the southern one ) in this paper . besides the outflow noted by sato & fukui , earlier molecular line observations",
    "have also provided evidence for rotational and infall motions in l1251b .",
    "for example , a velocity gradient of @xmath42.3 km s@xmath10 pc@xmath10 in the northeast  southwest direction across l1251b suggestive of rotational motion was detected by goodman et al .",
    "( 1993 ) in nh@xmath11 ( 1,1 ) ( also sato et al . 1994 ; t@xmath12th & walmsley 1996 ; anglada et al . 1997 ; morata et al .",
    "in addition , infall motions toward l1251b were suggested from the detections of asymmetric profiles with stronger blue peaks in hco@xmath13 1@xmath30 and 3@xmath32 , cs 2@xmath31 and h@xmath14co @xmath15@xmath16 by gregersen et al .",

    "( 1997 ) , though observations were published only toward the iras point source position .",

    "the offset of the n@xmath14h@xmath13 maxima and deficiencies of n@xmath1d@xmath2 from these objects are possibly caused by the depletion from the gas phase at densities greater than @xmath60 @xmath61 .",

    "our high - resolution observations of l1251b show further examples of the chemical behavior expected in the presence of nearby protostellar heating .",

    "( 2004 ) . for a dynamical model",
    ", we adopted the best - fit shu inside - out collapse model to the dust continuum emission as described in  4.1 .",
    "although l1251b has several sources , only one internal luminosity source at the center of a spherically symmetric envelope was assumed in the model .",
    "since irs1 is the dominant luminosity source by a factor of @xmath410 , however ( see paper i ) , this model is a reasonable first approximation , especially for interpreting the single dish observations . for this model , the infall rate from the disk to central protostar",
    "was tuned appropriately to match the luminosity calculated by observations at the given timescale ( young & evans 2005 ) .",
    "in addition , the interstellar radiation field was assumed to be attenuated to @xmath63 for consistency with the dust continuum modeling .",
    "an outflow was not included .",
    "we do not compare this chemical model with interferometric observations quantitatively since the density profile assumed in the 1-d model is not appropriate for the high resolution observations that reveal multiple sources .",
    "the chemical distribution close to the central source , however , is most sensitive to the temperature environment , so we can look for the effects of temperature increases around irs1 on the chemical abundances . as seen in figure 18 ,",
    "the model predicts a co evaporation radius ( which accordingly is also the n@xmath1h@xmath2 depletion radius ) of @xmath40.007 pc ( @xmath44 ) , i.e. , similar to the observed radius of the n@xmath14h@xmath13 hole at a 2 @xmath34 level of integrated intensity ( see figure 7a ) .",

    "a second h@xmath14co abundance peak seen in figure 18 caused by co evaporation does not affect significantly the h@xmath14co emission distribution likely because of the lower density and temperature of material at @xmath40.006 pc relative to material at @xmath40.003 pc associated with the inner abundance peak .",
    "therefore , this simple model is in good agreement with our observations close to the central source , where infall is kinematically dominant , and chemistry mainly depends on the evaporation of molecules from grain surfaces by heating .    near irs4",
    ", the associated h@xmath1co emission may not be due to an increased abundance due to localized dust grain heating .",
    "that source may not be luminous enough to heat grains above the h@xmath1co evaporation temperature at a projected distance of 600 au .",
    "the coincidence of the maxima of the integrated intensity of h@xmath1co 3@xmath282@xmath29 ( see figure 7b ) to one of that of hco@xmath2 1 - 0 ( see figure 7a ) suggests a possible origin from shocked outflow material .",
    "note that the h@xmath1co emission close to irs4 lies at redshifted velocities of @xmath64  to @xmath65 , and lies spatially at a full synthesized beam width ( 2 ) northeast of irs4 .",

    "the 1.3 mm dust continuum observations of l1251b with the sma revealed two condensations ( sma - n and sma - s ) unassociated with any detected near - infrared source .",

    "table 4 shows masses along the line of sight towards irs1 , irs2 , sma - n and sma - s , determined using the peak intensities of the 1.3 mm image and assuming a dust temperature of 20 k. we determined masses along the lines of sight rather than total masses from the respective fluxes because the extents of each were difficult to define with certainty in the crowded field , especially for sma - n and sma - s .",
    "furthermore , any differences in mass along the line of sight could be more easily discerned with a single sampling .",
    "table 4 shows that the peak intensities are quite similar ( i.e. , within 50% ) , suggesting quite similar masses along the line of sight if the temperatures are common .",

    "in particular , irs2 is not resolved at the @xmath44  resolution of the data , which is equivalent to a @xmath41200 au linear distance at the 300 pc distance of l1251b . since these sources are also highly embedded , however",

    ", the molecular emission ( see figure 1 ) may have high optical depths and the sub - cores may not be visible , despite the similarities between the densities these particular lines trace and the mean density of the sub - cores , i.e. , @xmath410@xmath72 @xmath61 .",
    "differences in the positions of maximum integrated intensities between these lines may also be due to their relative ( but high ) optical depths .",
    "( to determine if the @xmath43@xmath73 higher resolution of the 850 @xmath8 m map relative to the molecular line maps in figure 1 contributed to the different appearance of the continuum and line maxima , we smoothed the 850 @xmath8 m map to a resolution similar to that of the line maps ( 60 ) .",
    "the smoothed 850 @xmath8 m map , however , still shows an emission hole near the maxima of the line maps . )    the low optical depth of the 850  emission suggests that the much stronger continuum peak toward l1251b ( @xmath41 jy beam@xmath10 ) relative to the east core ( @xmath40.2 jy beam@xmath10 ) is indicative of a larger column density toward l1251b even if l1251b has been heated by internal sources .",
    "( note that the 850  emission peaks close to sma - s , not toward irs1 , as seen in figure 6 of paper i ) the 850 @xmath8 m fluxes of l1251b and the whole east core are similar , suggesting that their masses are also similar if their temperatures and dust opacities are themselves similar , i.e. , @xmath74 jy and @xmath71  if t = 20 k and @xmath75 = 0.02 @xmath76 g@xmath10 ( krgel & siebenmorgen 1994 ) . since l1251b contains several ysos but the east core does not , it is likely that l1251b is warmer than the east core , however .",
    "continuum observations at multiple wavelengths and modeling are needed to determine better relative values of dust temperature .",
    "table 5 lists the integrated intensities of molecular lines observed toward the centers of l1251b and the east core . to probe for any relative chemical evolution in the two cores ,",
    "we compare the relative integrated intensities of the 1@xmath30 transitions of h@xmath17co@xmath13 1@xmath30 and n@xmath1h@xmath2 , molecules found to be abundant respectively at earlier and later times in models of chemical evolution ( e.g. , lee et al . 2003 and references therein ) . for h@xmath17co@xmath13 1@xmath30 , the integrated intensities of l1251b and the east core are similar ( i.e. , @xmath41.3 k  and @xmath41.1 k km s@xmath10 respectively )",
    ". for n@xmath1h@xmath2 , however , the integrated intensity towards l1251b is larger than that towards the east core by a factor of two ( i.e. , @xmath44 k km s@xmath10 vs @xmath42 k km",
    "s@xmath10 respectively ) . the relative integrated intensity ratio between these lines , i.e. , @xmath46 for l1251b and @xmath43 for the east core , may be due to the relative chemical evolution , with l1251b being more chemically evolved .",
    "( note that the difference in n@xmath1h@xmath2 abundance might be greater than the difference in the n@xmath1h@xmath2 1@xmath30 intensity due to the higher optical depth in l1251b . )",
    "such differences in chemical evolution may result from differences in density since the chemical timescale shortens at a higher density .",
    "in addition , h@xmath17co@xmath2 and its isotopologue hco@xmath2 deplete significantly more than n@xmath1h@xmath2 in cold , dense environments such as in l1251b ( except in the immediate vicinities of protostellar objects ) .",
    "therefore , the higher ratio between the n@xmath1h@xmath2 and h@xmath17co@xmath2 intensities in l1251b than in the east core ( figure 1 ) may be caused by a denser environment in l1251b .",
    "various lines toward the east core suggest infall motions . therefore , the east core may be in earlier states of dynamical and chemical evolution than those of l1251b , and may harbor star formation in the future .",
    "l1251e , the densest c@xmath0o core of l1251 ( sato et al .",
    "1994 ) , has been observed at various molecular line transitions with single - dish telescopes , and l1251b , the protostellar group in the c@xmath0o core , has been observed with millimeter interferometers .",
    "we have compared these molecular line data to continuum data presented in paper i to study this region of l1251 more comprehensively .",
    "our results include :    \\1 .",
    "l1251e contains at least two cores , one coincident with l1251b and an east core detected from 850  continuum emission and various emission lines .",
    "the integrated intensities of these lines show primary maxima that are coincident with l1251b and other , secondary maxima associated with the east core which are non - coincident .",
    "no embedded sources have been detected in the @xmath47 irac or mips bands toward the east core ( paper i ) , suggesting it is starless .",
    "asymmetric profiles with stronger blue peaks have been detected toward the eastern core , however , that are suggestive of infall motions .",
    "the east core appears less dense and less chemically evolved than l1251b .",
    "the large - scale outflow associated with l1251b has been mapped in co 2@xmath31 with the cso .",
    "red and blue components of the outflow overlap around the brightest protostar , irs1 , and the near - infrared bipolar nebula source , irs2 .",
    "the co 2@xmath31 and @xmath17co 2@xmath31 maps observed with the sma resolve the outflow into a few components .",
    "hco@xmath13 3@xmath32 line emission observed with the cso across l1251b shows widespread line asymmetry that suggests infall motions towards the central group , with evidence for rotational or outflow motions from modifications of the line profiles at many off - center locations .",
    "\\4 . on a large scale , l1251b has a velocity gradient that is half the magnitude of that in the starless east core and is opposite in direction .",
    "previous low - resolution observations averaged the velocity gradients of both , causing rotational motions in the region to be misinterpreted .",
    "hco@xmath13 1@xmath30 line emission observed with the ovro mma is centered at irs1 and distributed linearly along the northwest  southeast direction of the larger - scale outflow .",
    "in contrast , the n@xmath14h@xmath13 1@xmath30 line emission also observed with the ovro mma is distributed between irs1 and irs2 ( like the position of maximum brightness of the iram 1.3 mm continuum emission ) and extended perpendicular to the outflow , i.e , . along the southwest  northeast direction .",
    "a position - velocity diagram of n@xmath14h@xmath13 1@xmath30 indicates very fast rotation in this flattened envelope , i.e. , @xmath77 s@xmath10 , where @xmath54 is the inclination of the rotational axis from the plane of sky .",
    "the maxima of n@xmath14h@xmath13 1@xmath30 and n@xmath14d@xmath13 3@xmath32 integrated intensity observed with the ovro mma and sma are offset from locations of maximum continuum brightness from the two starless objects , which were newly detected at 1.3 mm with the sma ( paper i ) .",
    "this offset may be due to reduction of n@xmath14h@xmath13 and n@xmath14d@xmath13 abundances at very high densities .",
    "ovro mma and sma observations reveal a lack of n@xmath14h@xmath13 emission at irs1 ( i.e. , a  hole \" ) but c@xmath0o and the h@xmath14co emission is coincident with irs1",
    ". these results are consistent with a chemo - dynamical evolution model where a central protostar heats up surrounding material . in this model , co and h@xmath1co are abundant close to the protostar where they are released into the gas phase from grain mantles , but n@xmath1h@xmath2 has had its abundance sharply reduced since it is depleted by reactions with gas - phase co.    support for this study was provided by nasa through hubble fellowship grant hst - hf-01187 awarded by the space telescope science institute , which is operated by the association of universities for research in astronomy , inc . , for nasa , under contract nas 5 - 26555 .",
    "this work was also supported by nsf grant ast-0307350 to the university of texas at austin and by the state of texas .",

    "we thank jonathan williams for allowing us to use his unpublished molecular line data , and we also thank chad young for his help for the dust continuum modeling of l1251b .",
