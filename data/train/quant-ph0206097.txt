    "quantum entanglement , an indispensable resource for quantum information processing such as superdense coding @xcite , quantum teleportation @xcite , quantum cryptography @xcite , and quantum computation @xcite , is expected to have a rich mathematical structure behind its weirdness . as in the case of other physical resources , quantification of entanglement",
    "is the key to understanding its full potential .",
    "the essentials of bipartite pure - state entanglement have already been revealed for both finite regimes and the asymptotic limit .",
    "the fundamental results are the intimate connection between the mathematical theory of majorization and entanglement manipulation @xcite , and the existence of a unique measure of entanglement in the asymptotic limit @xcite .",
    "one way of quantifying entanglement is to estimate the number of bell pairs , @xmath1 distilled from a given entangled state by local operations and classical communication ( locc ) .",
    "though the above quantity of distillable entanglement can be defined for mixed states , we deal with only pure states here . in order to make use of partially entangled states for quantum teleportation",
    ", we need to convert the partially entangled states into maximally entangled states by locc . the process is called entanglement concentration , and its efficiency in the asymptotic limit is the focus of this paper .",
    "the unique measure of bipartite pure - state entanglement gives the limitation on the efficiency of entanglement concentration .",
    "suppose we share @xmath0 identical copies of a partially entangled state @xmath2 where the schmidt coefficients squared are arranged in decreasing order , i.e. , @xmath3 , and sum to one .",
    "( schmidt coefficients are arranged in decreasing order throughout this paper . )",
    "bennett _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proved that the maximum number of bell pairs distilled per copy from @xmath4 is given by @xmath5 in the asymptotic limit , @xmath6 .",
    "( logarithms are taken to base two throughout this paper unless stated otherwise . )",
    "they imposed the condition that the success probability of entanglement concentration tends to one in the asymptotic limit , i.e. , @xmath7 where @xmath8 with this restriction , the maximum attainable entanglement yield is proven to be equation  ( [ entropy ] ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "much research on entanglement concentration has been undertaken from various viewpoints @xcite . among other things ,",
    "the bound on entanglement yield in deterministic concentration @xcite @xmath9 gives another quantification of entanglement .",
    "the restriction _",
    "means that the process succeeds with probability one both in finite regimes and in the asymptotic limit .    though the quantities @xmath10 and @xmath11 give entanglement yield in the asymptotic limit , where both processes succeed with probability one",
    ", the two quantities do not coincide .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to find out the reason for the discrepancy .",
    "we will see that it is caused by the difference of the rate at which failure probabilities decrease when @xmath0 tends to infinity in both concentration processes",
    ". roughly speaking , while we obtain @xmath10 when failure probability decreases slowly , we obtain @xmath11 when it decreases rapidly",
    ". we will represent the rate by the exponent of failure probability in the asymptotic limit ( _ error exponent _ ) .",
    "this is a common approach in the information sciences , and will allow us to ` tune ' between the two extremes just mentioned .",
    "the quantum fixed - length pure state source coding in reference   @xcite is another example that uses the notion of error exponents in quantum information theory .    in the derivation of @xmath10",
    ", we use the asymptotic equipartition property @xcite",
    ". however , a detailed analysis of the asymptotic behaviour requires more powerful mathematical tools ; namely , the method of types @xcite , which makes it possible to calculate the probabilities of rare events and derive stronger results than when we focus only on typical sequences .",
    "the argument via the method of types will give entanglement yield as a function of an error exponent and reveal the missing link between @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "in addition , we will also see that the success probability exponentially decreases when we try to distil more entanglement than @xmath10 ( strong converse ) .",
    "this was observed in reference  @xcite , but here we are able to derive the _ exact _ error rate .",
    "it was suggested that the two extremes @xmath10 and @xmath11 can also be expressed as some limits of rnyi entropy @xcite .",
    "we will also see that they can be linked by rnyi - entropy - like functions , which is useful for practical calculation .",
    "we can consider two different ways of analyzing entanglement concentration : one is estimating the optimal success probability of obtaining the exact copy of a maximally entangled state of a desired size , where we discard failure cases .",
    "the other is estimating the fidelity of the final state , which is generally a mixed state , to a maximally entangled state of a desired size , where we obtain the final mixed state with probability one .",
    "we will first derive the entanglement yield as a function of an exponent of failure probability ( error exponent ) under the condition that the optimal success probability converges to one in the asymptotic limit .",
    "then , we will also derive the entanglement yield as a function of an exponent of one minus fidelity , under the condition that the optimal fidelity converges to one in the asymptotic limit . the argument on fidelity",
    "can be reduced to that on probability via some lemmata .",
    "finally , the yield functions will turn out to be in the same form in the both cases . since transformations assumed in the argument on fidelity need not produce the exact copy of a maximally entangled state ,",
    "the treatment is more natural from a physical perspective than that on optimal success probability .",
    "in finite regimes , deterministically transforming a pure state into a maximally entangled state with optimal fidelity has been discussed in reference  @xcite , while we will consider that in the asymptotic limit .",
    "the strong converse will also be analyzed in terms of fidelity .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we begin in section [ sec : revisited ] by revisiting the entanglement concentration in finite dimensions . after a brief review of the method of types in section  [ sec : types ] , we will move on to the main result of this paper , error exponents and asymptotic entanglement concentration , in section  [ sec : asymptotic ] .",
    "section [ sec : strong ] discusses the strong converse . in section  [ sec : alternative formulae ] , we will present alternative formulae for the result proven in the preceding sections . finally , we will discuss interpretations of our result and of some properties of the yield function , then conclude the paper .",
    "some lemmata used in the proofs of our results are presented in appendices .",
    "in this section , we revisit entanglement concentration of finite - dimensional states so that the asymptotic limit will be smoothly derived from it .",

    "lo and popescu @xcite derived the optimal probability with which we distil @xmath15 from @xmath16 : @xmath17 } \\frac{l}{l - l+1 } \\sum_{i = l}^d p_i .",

    "thus , we can not distil a maximally entangled state with the schmidt number greater than @xmath14 .    in the following ,",
    "we reformulate the optimal probability @xmath18 in a more suitable form for our treatment of asymptotic entanglement concentration .",
    "our strategy for distilling a maximally entangled state consists of two parts :    1 .",
    "we perform a two - valued local measurement to change the initial distribution of the schmidt coefficients ( probabilistic part ) .",
    "if a desired result is obtained in the above measurement , we distil a maximally entangled state from the resultant state with probability one ( deterministic part ) .",
    "first , we briefly review the second ( deterministic ) part , which was investigated in reference  @xcite .",
    "suppose we wish to distil a maximally entangled state with the greatest possible schmidt number from @xmath16 with probability one .",
    "the maximum schmidt number of the maximally entangled state is @xmath19 , where @xmath20 represents the largest integer equal to or less than @xmath21 .",
    "thus , if we could make @xmath22 smaller somehow , the size ( schmidt number ) of the resultant maximally entangled state would become greater .",
    "note that , according to nielsen s theorem @xcite , the largest schmidt coefficient can not be deterministically decreased by locc .    in order to distil a maximally entangled state of size @xmath23 , we need to adjust the largest schmidt coefficient of the initial state before moving on to deterministic entanglement concentration in the second part .",
    "so , in the first ( probabilistic ) part , we perform the measurement presented below to truncate the initial distribution of the schmidt coefficients .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig1 ] , first we draw a truncating line that represents probability @xmath24 , which is uniquely determined by the size of the maximally entangled state as proved later .",
    "then we perform a two - valued local measurement on either side of the entangled pair by using measurement operators , @xmath25 with @xmath26 , and @xmath27 such that @xmath28 .",
    "measurement outcome 1 corresponds to the success of the entanglement concentration .",
    "it is easily seen that it occurs with probability @xmath29 which is shown schematically as the area of the shaded region below the truncating line @xmath24 in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "measurement outcome 2 corresponds to the failure of the concentration , and the failure probability , @xmath30 , is equal to the area of the region above the truncating line in figure  [ fig1 ] .     the distribution of the squared schmidt coefficients of a partially entangled state to be concentrated .",
    "each bar corresponds to a schmidt coefficient squared .",
    "the area of the shaded region below the truncating line @xmath24 represents the success probability of entanglement concentration . ]    in the case of measurement outcome 1 , the post - measurement state becomes @xmath31 whose schmidt coefficients squared are represented as the shaded region in figure  [ fig1 ] with an appropriate renormalization ; each bar ( schmidt coefficient ) is replaced with that divided by @xmath32 . since the largest schmidt coefficient of the post - measurement state is @xmath33 , we can distil a maximally entangled state of size @xmath34 in other words , our scheme distils a maximally entangled state of size @xmath35 with probability @xmath32 .",
    "the truncating probability @xmath24 is uniquely determined by a given integer @xmath35 via an implicit function @xmath36 which is given by equations  ( [ truncation ] ) and ( [ lvsp ] ) .",
    "since the right - hand side of equation  ( [ lvst ] ) is strictly monotone decreasing in @xmath37 $ ] for @xmath38 $ ] , @xmath24 is uniquely determined for a given integer @xmath39 $ ] .",
    "( when @xmath40 , @xmath15 can be distilled with probability one .",
    "thus , we do not need the probabilistic part . )",
    "the rest of this section gives the proof that the probability @xmath32 coincides with the optimal probability @xmath18 [ equation  ( [ lo ] ) ] .",
    "the truncating probability @xmath24 uniquely determines an integer @xmath41 satisfying @xmath42 .",
    "( see figure  [ fig1 ] . ) from equations  ( [ truncation ] ) and ( [ lvsp ] ) , we have @xmath43 thus , @xmath44 substituting this into equation  ( [ determining - t ] ) , we obtain an alternative expression of @xmath32 with @xmath41 and @xmath35 : @xmath45 on the other hand , equation  ( [ determining - t ] ) gives @xmath46 , i.e. , @xmath47 $ ] .",
    "thus , we have @xmath48 due to the right - hand side of equation  ( [ lo ] ) , which means the success probability of our scheme is optimal because @xmath18 has already been proven optimal .",
