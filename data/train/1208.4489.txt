    "water is one of the most abundant interstellar molecules after h@xmath0 and hence , it is important for interstellar chemistry and physics of molecular clouds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , due to the large atmospheric opacity , ground - based observations of the h@xmath0o lines in radio and infrared bands are almost impossible except for the isotopic species ( e.g. hdo and h@xmath6o ) and strong maser lines .",
    "in particular , the 6@xmath7@xmath35@xmath8 transition at 22  ghz ( lower state energy , @xmath9=642  k ) is known to show extremely strong maser emission in circumstellar envelopes ( cses ) around late - type stars , young stellar objects ( ysos ) in star - forming regions ( sfrs ) , and active galactic nuclei . the 22  ghz maser has been used as a unique probe of dense gas and their dynamics with very long baseline interferometers ( vlbi ) thanks to its extremely high brightness and compact structure ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "other h@xmath0o maser lines are also detected in millimeter / submillimeter wavelength @xcite .",
    "lower excitation lines in 183  ghz ( @xmath9=196  k ) and 325  ghz ( @xmath9=454  k ) are detected both in cses and around ysos while some of the higher excitation lines including vibrationally excited lines are detected only in cses .",
    "multi - transition studies of h@xmath0o maser lines could be powerful tools to investigate shocked regions in cses and ysos at the highest spatial resolution achieved with vlbi and millimeter / submillimeter interferometers when combined with the theoretical models @xcite .    in this letter ,",
    "we report the detection of the vibrationally excited h@xmath0o maser line at 232.68670  ghz ( @xmath9=3451  k ) in a massive sfr orion  kl at a distance of 420  pc @xcite with the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) .",
    "this line has been detected in late - type stars so far but not in ysos including orion  kl @xcite .",
    "thus , this is the first detection of the 232  ghz h@xmath0o maser line in ysos .",
    "we employed the public data obtained with the alma science verification ( sv ) on 2012 january 20 .",
    "they are part of a spectral line survey toward the orion  kl region at band  6 ( 215 - 245  ghz ) .",
    "the tracking center position of orion  kl was set to be r. a. = 05h35m14.35s and decl.=@xmath305@xmath102235.0 ( j2000 ) .",
    "the data consist of several spectral settings and net on - source time for each setting was about 20  minutes .",
    "the baseline lengths ranged from 17 to 265  k@xmath11 ( from 22 to 345  m ) consisted of 16@xmath1212  m antennas .",
    "the primary beam size of each 12  m antenna is about 30  at band 6 .",
    "the spectral resolution of the alma correlator was 488  khz , corresponding to the velocity resolution of 0.60@xmath30.65  km  s@xmath5 at the observed frequency range .",
    "dual polarization data were observed simultaneously .",
    "we made synthesis imaging with the calibrated data for selected observing frequency ranges by using the common astronomy software applications ( casa ) package .",
    "the natural weighted beam size was 1.7@xmath121.4 with the position angle of 171@xmath10 .",
    "the resultant typical rms ( root - mean - square ) noise level is 0.01@xmath30.03  jy  beam@xmath5 for each channel map . for comparison , we also made synthesized images of selected lines of methyl formate ( hcooch@xmath13 ) as discussed later .",
    "the mapped lines are summarized in table [ tab - lines ] .",
    "in addition to the sv data , we analyzed alma cycle 0 data for the continuum emission at band  6 in the orion  kl region .",
    "the observation was done in the extended configuration on 2012 april 08 with 17@xmath1212  m antennas .",
    "the observed frequency ranges were 240@xmath3244  ghz and 256@xmath3260  ghz .",
    "the alma correlator was set for low resolution wideband continuum observations and the spectral resolution was 15.625  mhz .",
    "the line emissions were subtracted from the visibility data and effective bandwidth was almost half of the observed frequency range .",
    "the synthesis imaging was done with the casa software package .",
    "the uniform - weighted synthesized beam size was 0.74@xmath120.56 at a position angle of 101@xmath10 .",
    "the on - source integration time was 30  s and the resultant rms noise level of the continuum image was 7  mjy  beam@xmath5 .",
    "further details will be published in the forthcoming paper ( t. hirota et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "first , we inspected the observed spectra of the alma sv data around the frequency range close to the 232  ghz h@xmath0o line . as a result",
    ", we found a significant spectral feature corresponding to a line - of - sight velocity with respect to the local standard of rest ( lsr ) of about 11  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "we checked the database of molecular lines , splatalogue , which is a compilation of the jpl , cdms , and lovas / nist catalogs @xcite , to confirm possible contamination of other spectral lines .",
    "we found that the torsionally excited hcooch@xmath13 line at 232.68393  ghz ( @xmath14=1 , 19@xmath15@xmath318@xmath16 e ) could be another candidate of this line if the source lsr velocity is about 8  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "thus , one should be cautious in identifying the detected lines .",
    "it is well known that orion  kl show an enormous amount of molecular lines described as a line forest @xcite .",
    "the alma data also show a number of spectral lines and a significant fraction of them are unassigned to known molecular lines . according to previous line survey and interferometer observations ,",
    "these molecular lines suggest complex velocity / spatial components in orion  kl such as the hot core , the compact ridge , sma1 , and source  i @xcite .",
    "all of them show different radial velocity , velocity width and spatial distribution .",
    "in addition , they are known to show significant chemical differentiation .",
    "for example , oxygen - bearing organic molecules such as hcooch@xmath13 are known to be distributed mainly in the compact ridge at an lsr velocity of 8  km  s@xmath5 with a linewidth of 2  km  s@xmath5 , while nitrogen - bearing species tend to peak at the hot core at the lsr velocity of 5  km  s@xmath5 and with wider velocity widths @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the sio masers are distributed within 100  au from the radio source  i @xcite . according to the observation with the very large array ( vla ) ,",
    "the 22  ghz h@xmath0o maser features are distributed in more extended regions , but they are concentrated around source  i , which are called the `` shell masers '' , and the compact ridge @xcite . if the detected feature really originates from the h@xmath0o masers at 232.68670  ghz , it can be distinguished based on the distribution and velocity structure of the emitting regions from other thermal lines .",
    "then we made synthesis images of the spectral feature of the 232.68393  ghz hcooch@xmath13 line and/or the 232.68670  ghz h@xmath0o line ( hereafter we call _ blended _ hcooch@xmath13/h@xmath0o feature ) by using the calibrated sv data .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig - map ] .",
    "for comparison , we show a reference image of another hcooch@xmath13 line at 232.73862  ghz ( @xmath14=1 , 19@xmath17@xmath318@xmath18 e ) having a similar frequency , lower state energy , and expected intensity ( hereafter we call this line _ pure _ hcooch@xmath13 feature ) . as can be seen in figure [ fig - map ] , overall distributions and peak intensities are quite similar .",
    "for example , both the _ blended _ hcooch@xmath13/h@xmath0o and the _ pure _ hcooch@xmath13 maps show four dominant compact condensations coincident with the hot core , the compact ridge , the northwest peak , and irc  7 .",
    "they are consistent with previous hcooch@xmath13 observations @xcite .",
    "one of the brightest peaks is coincident with the compact ridge with the integrated intensities of 3.5  jy  beam@xmath5  km  s@xmath5 and 4.9  jy  beam@xmath5  km  s@xmath5 for the _ blended _ hcooch@xmath13/h@xmath0o feature and the _ pure _ hcooch@xmath13 line , respectively .",
    "however , one can note a striking difference that only the _ blended _ hcooch@xmath13/h@xmath0o feature shows a significant peak at the position of source  i. this source",
    "is also associated with the strong sio masers @xcite and 22  ghz h@xmath0o masers @xcite . by subtracting the _ pure _ hcooch@xmath13 map from the _ blended _",
    "hcooch@xmath13/h@xmath0o map , the residual emission component is clearly concentrated at the source  i position as shown in figure [ fig - map](c ) .",
    "it is thought to be the contribution from the h@xmath0o line .",
    "a negative component in the compact ridge could be due to an intensity variation of the hcooch@xmath13 maps between the two transitions .",
    "we also imaged five more hcooch@xmath13 lines which are not affected by the contamination from other molecular lines ( table [ tab - lines ] ) , and we found that none of them shows a significant peak at the source  i position . therefore ,",
    "emission features in the _ blended _",
    "hcooch@xmath13/h@xmath0o map can be distinguished between hcooch@xmath13 and h@xmath0o lines ; hcooch@xmath13 is extended over the hot core , the compact ridge , the northwest peak , and irc  7 while h@xmath0o is only distributed around source  i.    to investigate the spatial and velocity structure of the _ blended _",
    "hcooch@xmath13/h@xmath0o feature more in detail , we made velocity channel maps and the spectra at the selected positions as shown in figures [ fig - chmap ] and [ fig - spectrum ] , respectively .",
    "the dominant emission components of the _ blended _",
    "hcooch@xmath13/h@xmath0o feature are found in the velocity channels from 6.9 to 17.0  km  s@xmath5 as shown in figure [ fig - chmap ] .",
    "they are most likely attributed to the hcooch@xmath13 line blended with the h@xmath0o line , while higher velocity components are affected by the contamination from the ethyl cyanide ( @xmath19ch@xmath13ch@xmath0cn ) line at 232.67737  ghz .",
    "other weak emission components can be seen in the velocity channels from 17.0 to 27.1  km  s@xmath5 and from @xmath38.2 to @xmath33.2  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "they are identified as the methyl acetylene ( @xmath19ch@xmath13cch ) and acetone ( ( ch@xmath13)@xmath0co ) lines at 232.67074  ghz and 232.69487  ghz , respectively",
    ". however , the channel maps show notable condensation around source  i with a velocity range wider than that of the hcooch@xmath13 and other molecular lines .",
    "these velocity structures can be seen more clearly in the spectra in figure [ fig - spectrum ] .",
    "the hcooch@xmath13 lines toward the hot core and the compact ridge show narrower linewidths of about 2  km  s@xmath5 at the peak velocities of 8  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "in contrast , the spectrum of the _ blended _",
    "hcooch@xmath13/h@xmath0o feature shows a double - peaked structure with the velocity range from @xmath310 to 20  km  s@xmath5 .",
    "their peak flux densities are derived by the two - component gaussian fitting to be 0.28@xmath200.02  jy and 0.43@xmath200.02  jy at the velocity of @xmath32.1@xmath200.6  km  s@xmath5 and 13.3@xmath200.4  km  s@xmath5 , respectively . on the other hand ,",
    "no spectral feature is detected for _ pure _ hcooch@xmath13 toward source  i.    interestingly , the spectral profile of the _ blended _",
    "feature toward source  i appears to be analogous to the 22  ghz shell masers @xcite and the 43  ghz sio ( @xmath21=1 ) masers @xcite as shown in figure [ fig - maser ] .",
    "one can see a common structure showing double - peaks at almost the same velocities and velocity ranges . since the higher velocity features of the sio ( @xmath21=1 ) maser show slightly redshifted with respect to the h@xmath0o maser lines , the _ blended _",
    "hcooch@xmath13/h@xmath0o feature would have a closer relation with the 22  ghz h@xmath0o masers .",
    "it is unlikely that other molecular lines with high velocity components contribute to this peak because no such molecular species is known except the sio thermal @xcite and maser @xcite lines , as well as the h@xmath0o maser lines @xcite .",
    "therefore , we can safely conclude that at least the emission feature associated with source  i is the vibrationally excited h@xmath0o maser line at 232.68670  ghz .",
    "as discussed above , we can identify the 232.68670  ghz feature detected in the alma sv data for orion  kl as the vibrationally excited h@xmath0o maser .",
    "this is the first detection of this maser line in ysos .",
    "the peak flux of the _ blended _ feature observed with the 2@xmath122  aperture is 0.43  jy ( figures [ fig - spectrum ] and [ fig - maser ] ) .",
    "it corresponds to the brightness temperature of 2.4  k. if this emitting region is as compact as this aperture size , the single - dish observation with the beam size of 30  would yield the brightness temperature of 0.01  k. thus , it was not detectable with the previous observations with single - dish telescopes @xcite , although a possible spectral feature can be seen in the line survey data by @xcite , probably attributed to the hcooch@xmath13 line .",
    "the vibrationally excited h@xmath0o masers have been detected in only several oxygen - rich late - type stars @xcite , which could be attributed to their higher excitation levels ( 3451  k ) than that of the 22  ghz maser ( 642  k ) .",
    "the 232  ghz h@xmath0o maser around source  i would be excited due to the internal heating by an embedded yso as expected from a maser pumping mechanism for late - type stars .",
    "source  i is also known as a powering source of the sio masers , which is quite rare for ysos @xcite .",
    "this observational evidence may imply similar characteristics of source  i and late - type stars .",
    "further studies with the millimeter / submillimeter masers in source  i , along with other ysos and cses in late - type stars , will be crucial in understanding the pumping mechanism of the h@xmath0o maser lines , physical and dynamical state of these maser sources , and accordingly mass - loss / accretion processes occurring in the ysos and cses .    the 232.68670  ghz h@xmath0o maser emission is concentrated around source  i. however",
    ", the distribution of the 232  ghz h@xmath0o maser features could not be resolved with the alma sv data with the beam size of 1.7@xmath121.4 . according to the double - peaked spectra of the 22  ghz and 232  ghz h@xmath0o maser as shown in figure [ fig - maser ] ,",
    "the 232  ghz maser features would have similar structure to that of the 22  ghz masers rather than the sio masers .",
    "higher resolution imaging will reveal their spatial structure and provide information about a possible powering source of the 232  ghz h@xmath0o maser ; whether they are really associated with the root of outflows / jets as traced by the 22  ghz h@xmath0o masers @xcite or with circumstellar disk as traced by the 43  ghz sio masers @xcite .    in the present study , we could not perfectly separate the contribution from the hcooch@xmath13 and the 232  ghz h@xmath0o maser lines mainly due to the insufficient spatial resolution . therefore",
    ", it is still unclear whether the 232  ghz masers are distributed other than in source  i , such as the compact ridge where strong h@xmath0o maser lines are sometimes detected @xcite .",
    "a search for the 232.68670  ghz h@xmath0o maser lines with higher spatial resolution would be important to distinguish their distribution by filtering out the contribution from the thermal and extended hcooch@xmath13 emission .",
    "our results clearly demonstrate alma s high possibility of detecting new millimeter / submillimeter maser lines with its high sensitivity / resolution .",
    "further observational studies with alma of millimeter / submillimeter masers will reveal spatial and velocity structure of the maser sources at a resolution of @xmath2210  mas or better , providing a complementary method to the vlbi studies of the sio and 22  ghz h@xmath0o masers .",
