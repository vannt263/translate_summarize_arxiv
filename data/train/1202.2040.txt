    "@xcite second , the measured pl results solely from recombination of the hh1:e1 transition , and hh - lh mixing can be neglected in that case .",
    "this assumption is supported by our measurements since we find that @xmath59 is close to 100% for resonant , circularly polarized excitation of the hh transition in the growth direction .",

    "the dashed lines depict the fits of the sqbs according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : extrapol ] ) .",
    "the fits clearly yield @xmath63 , i.e. , the spin excitation is solely in - plane .",
    "this is an important consistency check to rule out unintentional excitation in the growth direction .",
    "such an unintentional excitation could occur if part of the exciting laser light hits the growth surface and this light is then diffracted into the growth direction due to the large refractive index of gaas .",
    "it is conceivable that fast spin relaxation mechanisms effective at early time scales not accessible in our measurements may affect the spin polarization measured by extrapolation to time @xmath50 .",
    "however , in our experiments it appears unlikely that such a mechanism plays a significant role because any such additional spin relaxation channel must further reduce the measured degree of spin polarization .",
    "the overall good agreement of the absolute values of the measured versus the calculated spin orientations as a function of the laser energy [ see sec .  [",

    "we extract from the ple spectrum a full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the lowest hh transition of @xmath40  mev and use this value for a phenomenological lorentzian broadening of the numerically calculated spectrum .",
    "we briefly discuss the features of the measured @xmath1 going from low to high excitation energies . for resonant excitation at @xmath66  ev of the transition from the first hh subband to the first electron subband ( hh1:e1 ) , we find , as expected , @xmath67 . around the lh1:e1 transition at @xmath68",
    "ev , we observe a sign reversal of @xmath1 leading to a maximum negative initial degree of spin polarization of @xmath69 .",
    "the next peak at @xmath70  ev reflects the absorption edge of the hh1:e1 exciton continuum .",
    "we find two additional peaks at @xmath71  ev and @xmath72  ev , which correspond to the hh3:e1 and hh2:e2 transition , respectively .",
    "all experimental features are well reproduced by the calculated spectra .      the right column in fig .",
    "[ fig : growth_inplane ] shows ( a ) the measured @xmath1 , ( b ) the calculated @xmath1 , ( c ) the measured ple , and ( d ) the calculated ple as a function of the excitation energy .",
    "we use for these calculations a lorentzian broadening with an fwhm of 3  mev which is consistent with the measured ple spectrum for in - plane excitation .",
    "the significantly larger broadening for in - plane excitation results probably from surface effects such as local oxidation of the algaas qw barriers at the cleaved surface .",
    "moreover , our ple measurements are noisier for in - plane excitation than for excitation in the growth direction since the pl intensity is lower . finally , we note that we have to use a smaller laser - spot diameter for in - plane excitation so that small changes of the position of the exciting laser spot strongly change the detected pl intensity . nonetheless , we find no indication that the measured pl signal contained contributions from the lh1:e1 transition , consistent with the fact that this transition lies about 7  mev above the hh1:e1 transition , which makes such a contribution rather unlikely .",
    "all features in the spectrum for in - plane excitation are approximately 2  mev lower in energy than the corresponding features obtained for excitation in the growth direction .",
    "we expect that this result was caused by the position - dependent inhomogeneous strain that was unintenionally present in the sample during the low - temperature experiments , thus resulting in a small shift of the resonance energies .",
    "@xcite the sample was glued to a sample holder such that the edge used for the in - plane excitation was free - standing .",
    "thus upon cooldown the edge might have experienced a different strain compared to the rest of the sample .",
    "we note , furthermore , that the spectra for in - plane excitation and for excitation in growth direction were measured in different cooldowns , which likewise could have resulted in different amounts of unintentional strain in these experiments .",
    "in the ple spectrum measured for in - plane excitation the peak attributed to the lh1:e1 exciton has an asymmetric line shape , suggesting that two excitons with almost the same energy contribute to this peak .",
    "such a doublet structure may occur if the standard selection rules for a symmetric qw are relaxed due to the presence of a symmetry - breaking perpendicular electric field .",
    "@xcite we found that for the system studied here a weak field of a few kv / cm gives rise to a second resonance slightly above the lh1:e1 resonance .",
    "for our rather sensitive setup we can not exclude that such an electric field is present at the cleaved surface .",
    "we note that our calculations indicate that the additional resonance does not significantly affect the measured initial spin polarization @xmath1 .",
    "the features in the spectra at higher energies are not affected either by such a weak electric field .",
    "again , we discuss the features of @xmath1 going from low to high excitation energy . for resonant excitation of the hh1:e1 transition at @xmath73  ev , we measure @xmath74 , which is close to the calculated @xmath1 [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : growth_inplane](b ) ] .",
    "our calculations show that this small but finite @xmath1 results from the broadening of the lh1:e1 transition and that @xmath1 vanishes with decreasing broadening .",
    "this is consistent with the simplified model in sec .",
    "[ sec : qual ] which suggests that the polarization of the hh1:e1 pl in @xmath35 direction is always linearly polarized independent of the electron spin polarization , i.e. , the pl emitted in - plane of a qw gives no indication about the electron spin polarization in the case of the hh1:e1 transition .",
    "this would be different if the lh state contributed to the pl transition , e.g. , if lh and hh transitions overlapped due to broadening , if the lh states were thermally occupied , or if the lh transition were energetically below the hh transition due to strain .",
    "@xcite    figure  [ fig : growth_inplane](a ) shows for excitation energies between @xmath73  ev and @xmath75  ev an increase in @xmath1 as a function of energy with a maximum of the measured @xmath76 at the lh1:e1 transition ( @xmath75  ev ) .",
    "surprisingly , the measured @xmath1 at the lh1:e1 transition is significantly lower than the calculated value @xmath77 .",
    "such a difference between experiment and theory is only observed for resonant in - plane excitation of the lh transition .",
    "we discuss this point in more detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : bleaching ] . for excitation energies above the lh transition , @xmath1 is nearly constant apart from a dip at @xmath78  ev which results from the hh2:e2 transition .",
    "contrary to the case of resonant hh1:e1 excitation , we do not obtain @xmath79 since all excitons above the hh1:e1 absorption edge are fano resonances @xcite and the contribution of the lh1:e1 continuum gives rise to a nonzero @xmath1 .",
    "( color online ) @xmath1 as a function of the excitation energy for resonant lh1:e1 excitation at @xmath75  ev .",
    "the excitation power of @xmath40  mw for maximum @xmath1 is comparable to the excitation power used in fig .",
    "[ fig : growth_inplane ] . ]    in this section we discuss possible reasons for the reduction of the measured @xmath1 at the lh1:e1 transition . at first glance , spin - dependent phase - space filling of excitonic states could be a possible explanation for this behavior .",
    "for sufficiently large excitation powers @xmath80 , the optically created electrons and holes inhibit the creation of additional carriers due to pauli blocking .",
    "this effect is known as optical bleaching and leads to a decrease in @xmath1 with increasing excitation powers . to check for optical bleaching , we measure @xmath1 at the lh1:e1 transition as a function of @xmath80",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig : bleaching ] ) .",
    "the measurements are performed with a nearly identical experimental setup but , for experimental reasons , with a picosecond laser with a spectral linewidth of @xmath81  nm fwhm .",
    "the experimental results clearly show a strong influence of phase - space filling as @xmath1 decreases with increasing @xmath80 for @xmath82  mw . however",
    ", we still measure a maximal @xmath83 since @xmath1 also decreases for @xmath84  mw .",
    "such a decrease of @xmath1 with decreasing excitation power has been observed before for excitation in growth direction ( see fig .  6 in ref .  ) and has been explained by a fast initial spin relaxation , i.e. , a fast excitonically induced electron spin relaxation during the thermalization process which takes place within our time resolution .",
    "we may expect that fast initial spin relaxation is particularly important for the lh1:e1 resonance because thermalization of the resonantly excited lh excitons is much slower than the nearly instantaneous thermalization of non - resonantly excited excitons in the continuum where electron - electron and electron - phonon scattering occurs on very short time scales of the order of 100  fs  consistent with the fact that only for the lh1:e1 resonance do we measure a value of @xmath1 that is significantly lower than theoretically expected .",
    "the initial spin polarization @xmath1 may also be reduced due to an enhanced broadening of the resonance lines for in - plane excitation compared to excitation in growth direction .",
    "this can clearly be seen by comparing the ple data for both excitation geometries : the resonances for in - plane excitation are shifted to lower energies as in the case of excitaton in growth direction ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : growth_inplane ] ) .",
    "it appears that this has a large effect on the lh1:e1 transition , so that we might face an energy - dependent line broadening here .",
    "since the broadening of the resonances ( in our case approximately 3  mev ) implies smaller values for the measuerd @xmath1 , our measured data for @xmath1 agrees well with the measured ple data for in - plane excitation .",
    "to obtain a theoretical model for the optical spin orientation , it is our goal to evaluate the spin density matrix for the optically induced electron distribution .",
