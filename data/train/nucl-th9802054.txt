    "the theoretical description of weakly bound exotic nuclei close to the drip - line is one of the most exciting challenges today .",
    "what makes this subject both particularly interesting and difficult , is the proximity of the particle continuum implying strong modification of the effective nucleon  nucleon interaction and causing unusual spatial properties of the nucleon density distribution ( halo structures , large diffusivity ) .",
    "many of those nuclei are involved in the chain of thermonuclear reactions and , in the absence of data at relevant energies , the models of stars rely to certain extent on calculated astrophysical factors ( see bahcall ( 1989 ) )  .    in weakly bound exotic systems ,",
    "the number of excited bound states or narrow resonances is small and , moreover , they couple strongly to the particle continuum .",
    "hence , these systems should be described in the quantum open system formalism which does not artificially separate the subspaces of ( quasi- ) bound ( the @xmath2-subspace ) and scattering ( the @xmath3-subspace ) states . for well bound nuclei close to the @xmath4-stability line",
    ", microscopic description of states in the first subspace is given by nuclear sm with model - space dependent effective two - body interactions , whereas the latter subspace is treated in terms of coupled channels equations . in this work ,",
    "we question the validity of this basic paradigm of nuclear physics , and propose its modification for weakly stable exotic nuclei by taking into account coupling between @xmath2   and @xmath3   subspaces in terms of residual nucleon  nucleon interaction .",
    "this coupling modifies the scattering solutions as well as the spectroscopic quantities for interior bound states .    as said before , we are interested in describing low lying bound and quasi - bound states in exotic nuclei .",
    "for that reason , we can restrict description of particle continuum to the subset of one nucleon decay channels .",
    "still , in few rare cases of two - nucleon halo nuclei , this limitation may turn out to be restrictive . in any case ,",
    "further improvement of our model to more complicated channels like , e.g. , @xmath5 - channels , can be done as well ( balashov ( 1964 ) ) .",
    "the influence of scattering continuum on the mean - field properties has been addressed before ( see dobaczewski ( 1996 ) for review ) .",
    "no such analysis has been done so far for the realistic sm .",
    "a possible starting point could be the continuum shell model ( csm ) approach ( fano 1961 , mahaux and weidenmller ( 1969 ) , philpott ( 1977 ) ) , which in the restricted space of configurations generated using the finite - depth potential , has been studied for the giant resonances and the radiative capture reactions probing the microscopic structure of these resonances ( barz ( 1977,1978 ) , fladt ( 1988 ) ) .",
    "this is insufficient for nuclei close to drip lines , where it is essential to have a most realistic description of bound state subspace .",
    "for that reason , the corner - stone of our approach , called the shell model embedded in the continuum ( smec ) , is the _ realistic  sm _ itself which is used to generate the @xmath6-particle wavefunctions .",
    "this choice implies that the coupling between sm states and the one - particle scattering continuum must be given by the residual interaction . in our case",
    ", we use the residual interaction in the form : @xmath7 with @xmath8   and @xmath9  .",
    "the key element of both smec and csm is the treatment of single - particle resonances , which on one side may have an important amplitude inside a nucleus and , on other side , they exhibit asymptotic behaviour of scattering wavefunctions ( bartz 1977 ) . the part of resonance for @xmath10  , where @xmath11   is the cut - off radius , is included in @xmath2 subspace , whereas the remaining part is left in the @xmath3 subspace .",
    "the wavefunctions of both subspaces are then renormalized in order to ensure the orthogonality of wavefunctions in both subspaces .    in the smec calculations , we solve identical equations as in the csm ( bartz ( 1977 ) ) but due to specificity of exotic nuclei , ingredients of these calculations",
    "are modified . for the bound states we solve the sm problem : @xmath12  , using the code antoine ( caurier ( 1989 ) ) .",
    "@xmath13   is _ identified _ with the realistic sm hamiltonian and @xmath14   are the @xmath6-particle ( quasi- ) bound wavefunctions .",
    "the quasi - bound resonances in the continuum are included as well .    0.8    for the continuum part",
    ", we solve the coupled channel equations : @xmath15 where index @xmath16   denotes different channels and @xmath17  .",
    "the sign @xmath18 characterizes the boundary conditions , i.e. , whether we consider incoming ` @xmath19 ' or outgoing ` @xmath20 ' scattering waves . in our case , we have ingoing wave in the input channel and outgoing waves in all channels .",
    "the structure of @xmath21  -  nucleus is given by the sm , whereas one nucleon occupies a scattering state .",
    "the channel states are defined by coupling one nucleon in the continuum to a ` hole state ' of @xmath21  -  nucleus .",
    "the sm wavefunction has an incorrect asymptotic behaviour for states in the scattering continuum .",
    "on the other hand , the standard approach consisting of adjusting values of the two - body matrix elements to the experimental data and/or modifying the monopole term of the effective interaction ( dufour and zuker ( 1996 ) ) , makes the definition of average single - particle field and the radial dependence of the single - particle wavefunctions somewhat arbitrary .",
    "therefore , to generate both single - particle resonances and the radial formfactors of occupied orbits entering the coupling matrix elements ( [ force ] ) between states in the subspaces @xmath2   and @xmath3  , we use the finite - depth average potential of saxon - woods type with spin - orbit part included .",
    "the parameters of the average potential are fitted to reproduce experimental single - particle states , whenever their identification is possible .",
    "this is the initial choice of potential , because the microscopic coupling of bound and scattering states generates the correction term to the mean - field which modifies the single - particle wavefunctions for each @xmath22   of the quasi - bound state .",
    "this correction term must be carefully taken into account otherwise , the solutions including coupling of @xmath2   and @xmath3   subspaces could be non - orthogonal .",
    "the third system of equations are the coupled channel equations : @xmath23 with the source term @xmath24  , which is given by the sm structure of @xmath6 - particle wavefunction for state @xmath14  .",
    "these equations define functions @xmath25   which describe the decay of quasi - bound state @xmath14   in the continuum .",
    "the source @xmath24   couples the wavefunction of @xmath6 - nucleon localized states with @xmath21 - nucleon localized states + one nucleon in the continuum .",
    "the formfactor of the source term is given by the same average potential as used in the @xmath3-space ( [ esp ] ) .",
    "the residual coupling ( [ force ] ) is also identical .",
    "the complete solution can be expressed by means of three functions : @xmath14  , @xmath26   and @xmath27 : @xmath28 where @xmath29   is the effective sm hamiltonian including the coupling to the continuum and @xmath30   is the green function for the motion of single particle in @xmath3  .",
    "matrix @xmath31 is symmetric and complex .",
    "it can be diagonalized by the orthogonal transformation : @xmath32   with complex eigenvalues @xmath33 .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath31   at energies @xmath34   determine the energies and widths of resonance states . with this changes ,",
    "one obtains : @xmath35^{-1 } < { \\tilde { \\phi}_i } \\mid h \\mid { \\xi}_{e}^{c } > \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the wavefunction of continuum state modified by the discrete states and : @xmath36 for the wavefunction of discrete state modified by the continuum states .",
    "as an example of smec calculations for bound and resonant states , let us consider the proton - rich nucleus @xmath0b  .",
    "1 compares sm spectrum for @xmath38   states of @xmath0b   calculated in the @xmath39 - shell using the cohen and kurath ( 1965 ) ( ck ) interaction , with those obtained in the smec for two different strength @xmath40   of the residual interaction ( [ force ] ) . in the smec calculations , the saxon - woods average potential with parameters : @xmath41 mev , @xmath42 mev , @xmath43 fm and @xmath44   was used as a starting guess .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath0b does not show large sensitivity to the choice of these parameters .",
    "this initial average potential is then modified for each @xmath22   state by the coupling to the continuum .",
    "this correction make the average potential deeper , it increases slightly the diffusivity and produceses a maximum at the center of the potential .",
    "it is the corrected potential which is then used to calculate the radial formfactors of coupling matrix elements and single - particle wavefunctions .",
    "the coupling to the continuum mixes the unperturbed sm states .",
    "for example for @xmath45 mev@xmath46@xmath47 in ( [ force ] ) , the wavefunction for the first @xmath48 resonance has an overlap of 0.992 , @xmath49   and @xmath50   with unperturbed sm states @xmath48 , @xmath51 and @xmath52  , respectively .",
    "the calculated width of @xmath48 state is 17  kev and 29  kev for @xmath53 and 1200 mev@xmath46@xmath47   respectively .",
    "the experimental width for this state is @xmath54  kev .",
    "one should notice that also the energy difference between @xmath55   and @xmath48 states is improved by inclusion of the coupling to the continuum .      the @xmath57   decay of @xmath0b , which is formed by the reaction @xmath58 at the center of mass ( c.m . )",
    "energy of about 20 kev , is the main source of high energy solar neutrinos . in the absence of data in this region ,",
    "the input of standard model for the solar neutrino problem ( bahcall and ulrich ( 1988 ) ) should be compared with those of    0.95    various calculations . in the smec , the initial wavefunction @xmath59_{j_i^{\\pi}=1^{+}})$ ]   is : @xmath60^{j_a}\\times\\chi^{i_t}\\biggr]^{(j_i ) } _ { m_i }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the final wavefunction @xmath61_{j_f^{\\pi}=2^{+}})$ ] is : @xmath62^{j_b}\\times\\chi^{i_t}\\biggr]^{(j_f ) } _ { m_f }   \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath63   and @xmath64   denote the spin of target nucleus and incoming proton , respectively .",
    "@xmath65   is the coefficient of fractional parentage and @xmath66   is the s.p .",
    "wavefunction in the many - particle state @xmath67  . with the wavefunctions",
    "@xmath68   and @xmath69  , we calculate the transition amplitudes : @xmath70 for @xmath71   and @xmath72   and : @xmath73 \\cr \\hfill + \\mu_t ( -1)^{j_f - j_i } \\hat i_t",
