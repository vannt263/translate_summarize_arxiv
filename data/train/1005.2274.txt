    "the core physics behind all - optical quantum manipulation is to explore the single - photon scattering and propagation in the confined structure of the sizes comparable to the wavelength of the photon .",
    "the investigations about the single - photon propagation in one - dimension involve some new phenomena , such as the perfect reflection of the single photon by atomic mirror lukin , fan , zhou , zhou5,olshanii , slowing light processes liyong1,liyong2,zhou1,zhou2,hughes1 in hybrid coupled - resonator waveguides , and other related issues @xcite .",
    "the hybrid structures concerned here could be implemented physically with linear defect cavities in photonic crystals @xcite  with doped quantum dots , or superconducting transmission line resonators @xcite coupled to a superconducting qubit @xcite .",
    "these physical systems with artificial band structures coupled to a two - level system enable us to control the transport of a single photon . by tuning the structure parameters of the hybrid system ,",
    "the two - level system acts as a quantum switch , making the transporting single photon be reflected perfectly , or transmit totally . in this sense , the two - level system can behave as an ideal mirror @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that a single - photon transistor using nanoscale surface plasmons @xcite coupled with a three level atom in eit ( electromagnetically induced transparency ) setup liyong1,liyong2,gong , zhou1,zhou2 , exhibits controllable behavior in the transmission spectra .",
    "we have re - examined the coherent transport of a single photon in a coupled - resonator array coupled to a controllable two - level system @xcite .",
    "being different from the linear dispersion relation in chang _",
    "s setups @xcite , the cosine - type dispersion @xcite will result in two bound - states in the hybrid system .",
    "the total reflection by the two - level system , which behaves as an ideal mirror , has been found associated with the fano - feshbach and breit - wigner line shapes @xcite around the resonance in the reflection spectrum .",
    "however , in all these works @xcite , we emphasize that the perfect reflection exists only at a specific frequency point .",
    "it brings physical difficulties in practical applications , such as the efficiency to control an optical pulse , which actually is a superposition of the plane waves with different frequencies where the off - resonant components could deviate from the perfect reflection point dramatically .    in this paper",
    ", we propose an experimentally accessible setup based on the coupled - resonator array with doped atoms hybrid system , which is excepted to realizes perfect reflection with wide spectrum , and thus can perfectly reflect an optical pulse , namely , a single photon wave packet . here , we use a thick  atomic mirror which is made of an array of two - level atoms individually doped in some cavities arranged in a coordinate region of the one - dimensional coupled - cavity waveguide .",
    "the physical mechanism is intuitive : when a photon little far from resonance reaches one cavity coupled to the doped atom , it is reflected by the atom partly , and then the left part passing through the next atom experiences the same process .",
    "this process is repeated many times , which may realizes the perfect reflection with wide spectrum so long as the interference enhancement could be suppressed by some mechanism .",
    "the emergence of wide - band spectrum is also shown schematically in fig .",
    "1 , where the perfect reflection region is from a specific incident energy point ( for single atom ) to a wide band ( for more than one atoms ) .    in details , we will study the wide - band scattering phenomena for our proposed atomic mirror by using the discrete coordinate scattering approach @xcite .",
    "here , with the second order processes for the atom absorbing a photon and then radiating back inside cavity , the basic role of the doped atoms is to provide an effective potential like a local resonant dirac comb @xcite , which leads to the stopping and slowing light phenomena @xcite . by detuning the coupling strength of the atom coupled to the single cavity mode",
