    "atmospheric neutrino data from super - kamiokande provides strong evidence that @xmath12 s created in the atmosphere oscillate to @xmath13 with mass - squared difference @xmath14  ev@xmath3 and almost maximal amplitude  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the recent solar neutrino data from the sudbury neutrino observatory ( sno ) establishes that electron neutrinos change flavor as they travel from the sun to the earth : the neutral - current measurement is consistent with the solar neutrino flux predicted in the standard solar model  @xcite , while the charged - current measurement shows a depletion of the electron neutrino component relative to the total flux  @xcite .",
    "global fits to solar neutrino data give a strong preference for the large mixing angle ( lma ) solution to the solar neutrino puzzle , with @xmath15 ev@xmath3 and amplitude close to 0.8  @xcite .",
    "the combined atmospheric and solar data may be explained by oscillations of three neutrinos , that are described by two mass - squared differences , three mixing angles and a @xmath4 violating phase .",
    "the atmospheric and solar data roughly determine @xmath16 , @xmath1 and the corresponding mixing angles .",
    "the lma solar solution will be tested decisively ( and @xmath17 measured accurately ) by the kamland reactor neutrino experiment  @xcite .",
    "more precise measurements of the other oscillation parameters may be performed in long - baseline neutrino experiments . the low energy beam at minos  @xcite plus experiments with icarus  @xcite and opera  @xcite will allow an accurate determination of the atmospheric neutrino parameters and may provide the first evidence for oscillations of @xmath18 at the atmospheric mass scale  @xcite .",
    "it will take a new generation of long - baseline experiments to further probe @xmath18 appearance and to measure the leptonic @xmath4 phase .",
    "matter effects are the only means to determine sgn(@xmath19 ) ; once sgn(@xmath19 ) is known , the level of intrinsic @xmath4 violation may be measured .",
    "matter effects and intrinsic @xmath4 violation both vanish in the limit that the mixing angle responsible for @xmath20 oscillations of atmospheric neutrinos is zero .",
    "it is now well - known that there are three two - fold parameter degeneracies that can occur in the measurement of the oscillation amplitude for @xmath20 appearance , the ordering of the neutrino masses , and the @xmath4 phase  @xcite . with only one @xmath21 and one @xmath22 measurement",
    ", these degeneracies can lead to eight possible solutions for the oscillation parameters ; in most cases , @xmath4 violating ( @xmath23 ) and @xmath4 conserving ( @xmath24 ) solutions can equally explain the same data .",
    "studies have been done on how a superbeam  @xcite , neutrino factory  @xcite , superbeam plus neutrino factory  @xcite , or two superbeams with one at a very long baseline  @xcite could be used to resolve one or more of these ambiguities .    in this paper",
    "we show that by combining the results of two superbeam experiments with different medium baselines , @xmath0  km , the ambiguity associated with the sign of @xmath19 can be resolved , even when it can not be resolved by the two experiments taken separately .",
    "furthermore , the ability to determine sgn(@xmath25 ) from the combined data is found to not be greatly sensitive to the size of @xmath1 , unlike the situation where data from only a single baseline is used .",
    "if both experiments are at or near the peak of the oscillation , a good compromise is obtained between the sensitivities for resolving sgn(@xmath19 ) and for establishing the existence of @xmath4 violation .",
    "if @xmath9 is not known accurately , the neutrino energies and baselines can be chosen to give fairly good sensitivity to the sign of @xmath19 and to @xmath4 violation for a range of @xmath9 .",
    "the organization of our paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : degen ] we discuss the parameter degeneracies that can occur in the analysis of long - baseline oscillation data . in sec .",
    "[ sec : joint ] we analyze how two long - baseline superbeam experiments can break degeneracies , determine the neutrino parameters , and establish the existence of @xmath4 violation in the neutrino sector , if it is present .",
    "a summary is presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "we work in the three - neutrino scenario using the parametrization for the neutrino mixing matrix of ref .  @xcite .",
    "if we assume that @xmath26 is the neutrino eigenstate that is separated from the other two , then @xmath27 and the sign of @xmath28 can be either positive or negative , corresponding to the mass of @xmath26 being either larger or smaller , respectively , than the other two masses .",
    "the solar oscillations are regulated by @xmath29 , and thus @xmath30 .",
    "if we accept the likely conclusion that the solar solution is lma  @xcite , then @xmath31 and we can restrict @xmath32 to the range @xmath33 $ ] .",
    "it is known from reactor neutrino data that @xmath34 is small , with @xmath35 at the 95% c.l .",
    "thus a set of parameters that unambiguously spans the space is @xmath28 ( magnitude and sign ) , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath5 ; only the @xmath39 angle can be below or above @xmath40 .    for the oscillation probabilities for @xmath20 and @xmath41 we use approximate expressions given in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which the probabilities are expanded in terms of the small parameters @xmath34 and @xmath42  @xcite , which reproduces well the exact oscillation probabilities for @xmath43  gev , @xmath44 , and @xmath45  km  @xcite . in all of our calculations",
    "we use the average electron density along the neutrino path , assuming the preliminary reference earth model  @xcite .",
    "our calculational methods are described in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we expect that @xmath46 and @xmath47 will be measured to an accuracy of @xmath48% at @xmath49 from @xmath50 survival in long - baseline experiments  @xcite , while @xmath36 will be measured to an accuracy of @xmath48% at @xmath51 and @xmath37 will be measured to an accuracy of @xmath52 at @xmath51 in experiments with reactor neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "the remaining parameters ( @xmath34 , the @xmath4 phase @xmath53 , and the sign of @xmath28 ) must be determined from long - baseline appearance experiments , principally using the modes @xmath18 and @xmath41 with conventional neutrino beams , or @xmath54 and @xmath55 at neutrino factories . however , there are three parameter degeneracies that can occur in such an analysis : ( i ) the ( @xmath56 ) ambiguity  @xcite , ( ii ) the sgn(@xmath28 ) ambiguity  @xcite , and ( iii ) the ( @xmath57 ) ambiguity  @xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a complete discussion of these three parameter degeneracies ) . in each degeneracy ,",
    "two different sets of values for @xmath53 and @xmath34 can give the same measured rates for both @xmath21 and @xmath22 appearance and disappearance . for each type of degeneracy the values of @xmath34 for",
    "the two equivalent solutions can be quite different , and the two values of @xmath53 may have different @xmath4 properties , e.g. , one can be @xmath4 conserving and the other @xmath4 violating .",
    "a judicious choice of @xmath58 and @xmath59 can reduce the impact of the degeneracies .",
    "for example , if @xmath60 is chosen such that @xmath61 ( the peak of the oscillation in vacuum ) , then the @xmath62 terms in the average appearance probabilities vanish , even after matter effects are included  @xcite .",
    "then since it is @xmath63 that is being measured , the ( @xmath56 ) ambiguity is reduced to a simple ( @xmath64 ) ambiguity , @xmath23 solutions are no longer mixed with @xmath24 solutions , and @xmath34 is in principle determined ( for a given sgn(@xmath28 ) and @xmath39 ) .",
    "if @xmath58 is chosen to be long enough ( @xmath65  km ) , then the predictions for @xmath66 and @xmath67 no longer overlap if @xmath68 a few degrees , and the sgn(@xmath69 ) ambiguity is removed ; our previous studies indicated that for @xmath70  ev@xmath3 this happens at @xmath71  km if @xmath72  @xcite ( before experimental uncertainties are considered ) .",
    "however , the persistence of the sgn(@xmath28 ) ambiguity is highly dependent on the size of the solar oscillation mass scale , because large values of @xmath36 cause the predictions for @xmath66 and @xmath67 to overlap much more severely than when @xmath42 is smaller .",
    "also , existing neutrino baselines are no longer than 735  km . in this paper",
    "we explore the possibility that two experiments with medium baselines ( @xmath0  km ) can determine sgn(@xmath28 ) , even when data from one of the baselines alone can not .",
    "we then address the sensitivity for establishing @xmath4 violation .",
    "for our analysis we take one baseline to be 295  km , the distance for the proposed experiment from the japan hadron facility ( jhf ) to the super - kamiokande detector at kamioka . for the neutrino spectrum of this experiment we use their @xmath73 off - axis beam with average neutrino energy of 0.7  gev  @xcite . for the second experiment",
    "we assume an off - axis beam in which the beam axis points at a site 735  km from the source ( appropriate for a beamline from numi at fermilab to soudan , or from cern to gran sasso ) . for the off - axis spectra of the numi experiment we use the results presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , which provides neutrino spectra for 39 different off - axis angles ranging from @xmath74 to @xmath75 .    using the off - axis components of the beam has the advantage of a lower background  @xcite due to reduced @xmath76 contamination and a smaller high - energy tail .",
    "off - axis beams also offer flexibility in the choice of @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "for example , for a beam nominally aimed at a ground - level site a distance @xmath77 from the source , the distance to a ground - level detector with off - axis angle @xmath78 can lie anywhere in the range @xmath79 where @xmath80 , and @xmath81  km is the radius of the earth .",
    "then for @xmath82 the possible range of distances for an off - axis detector at approximately ground level is @xmath83 the neutrino energy and neutrino flux @xmath84 decrease with increasing off - axis angle as @xmath85 where @xmath86 is boost factor of the decaying pion .",
    "thus a wide range of @xmath58 and @xmath59 can be achieved with a single fixed beam , although the event rate will drop with increasing off - axis angle because the flux decreases and the neutrino cross section is smaller at smaller @xmath59 ( thereby putting a limit on the usable range of @xmath58 and @xmath59 ) .",
    "for the first experiment at @xmath87  km , we assume that the neutrino spectrum is chosen so that the @xmath62 terms in the @xmath21 and @xmath22 oscillation probabilities vanish ( after averaging over the neutrino spectrum ) , using the best existing experimental value for @xmath28 . the jhf @xmath73 off - axis beam  @xcite satisfies this condition for @xmath88  ev@xmath3 .",
    "this spectrum choice reduces the ( @xmath89 ) ambiguity to a simple ( @xmath90 ) ambiguity , as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : degen ] . for the second experiment",
    "we allow @xmath91 and @xmath78 to vary within the restrictions of eq .",
    "( [ eq : loa2 ] ) . this flexibility can be fully utilized if a deep underground site is not required ; the short duration of the beam operation ( an 8.6  @xmath92s pulse with a 1.9  s cycle time  @xcite ) may enable a sufficient reduction in the cosmic ray neutrino background .",
    "we assume that the proton drivers at the neutrino sources have been upgraded from their initial designs ( from 0.8 to 4.0  mw for jhf  @xcite and from 0.4 to 1.6  mw for fnal  @xcite ) , so that they are both true neutrino superbeams .",
    "we assume two years running with neutrinos and six years with antineutrinos at jhf , and two years with neutrinos and five years with antineutrinos at fnal ; these running times give approximately equivalent numbers of charged - current events for neutrinos and antineutrinos at the two facilities , in the absence of oscillations . for detectors , we assume a 22.5  kt detector in the jhf beam ( such as the current super - k detector ) and a 20  kt detector in the fnal beam ( which was proposed in ref .",
    "larger detectors such as hyper - kamiokande or uno would allow shorter beam exposures or higher precision studies .",
    "in all of our calculations , we assume @xmath93  ev@xmath3 , @xmath94 , @xmath95  ev@xmath3 , and @xmath96 , unless noted otherwise .",
    "we first consider the minimum value of @xmath5 for which the signal in the neutrino appearance channel can be seen above background at the @xmath49 level ( the discovery reach ) , varying over a range of allowed values for @xmath78 and @xmath91 in the second experiment .",
    "the discovery reach depends on the value of @xmath53 and the sign of @xmath28 ; the best ( when @xmath97 ) and worst ( when @xmath98 ) cases in the @xmath21 channel ( after varying over @xmath53 ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : discovery ] . in the @xmath22 channel ,",
    "the best case occurs for @xmath99 and the worst for @xmath97 . in our calculations",
    "we assume a background that is 0.5% of the unoscillated charged - current rate ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and that the systematic error is 5% of the background .",
    "however , we note that our general conclusions are not significantly affected by reasonable changes in these experimental uncertainty assumptions .",
    "detector positions where there is no @xmath62 dependence in the rates are denoted by boxes .",
    "the best reach is @xmath100 , which occurs for @xmath101-@xmath102 . in the worst case scenario",

    "the question we next consider is whether an additional measurement of @xmath104 and @xmath105 at @xmath91 can determine sgn(@xmath28 ) , measure @xmath4 violation , and distinguish @xmath53 from @xmath108 .",

    "two superbeam experiments at different baselines , each measuring @xmath20 and @xmath41 appearance , are significantly better at resolving the sgn(@xmath69 ) ambiguity than one experiment alone . using beams from a 4.0  mw jhf with a 22.5  kt detector @xmath73 off axis at 295  km and a 1.6  mw numi with a 20  kt detector @xmath194-@xmath123 off axis at @xmath195-@xmath125  km , sgn(@xmath28 )",
    "can be determined for @xmath196 if @xmath88  ev@xmath3 .",
    "sensitivities for other beam powers and detector sizes are given in table  [ tab : sign1 ] .",
    "2 .   for the most favorable cases ,",
    "a higher value for the solar oscillation scale @xmath36 does not greatly change the sensitivity to sgn(@xmath28 ) when @xmath21 and @xmath22 data from two different baselines are combined ( unlike the single baseline case , where the ability to determine sgn(@xmath28 ) is significantly worse for @xmath197  ev@xmath3 ) .",
    "3 .   running both experiments at the oscillation peaks , such that the @xmath62 terms in the average probabilities vanish , provides good sensitivity to both sgn(@xmath28 ) and to @xmath4 violation . on the other hand ,",
    "the ability to resolve the ( @xmath198 ) ambiguity is lost , and the ( @xmath199 ) ambiguity is not resolved for any experimental arrangement considered .",
    "however , the ( @xmath90 ) and ( @xmath170 ) ambiguities do not substantially affect the ability to determine whether or not @xmath4 is violated ( although the latter ambiguity could affect the inferred value of @xmath34 by as much as a factor of 2 ) .",
    "4 .   since running at or near the oscillation peaks is favorable , knowledge of @xmath46 to about 10% ( from minos ) before these experiments are run would be advantageous . if @xmath200 is not known that precisely in advance , then the detector off - axis angle and baseline can still be chosen to give fairly good ( though not optimal ) sensitivities to sgn(@xmath28 ) and @xmath4 violation .",
    "we conclude that superbeam experiments at different baselines may greatly improve the prospects for determining the neutrino mass ordering in the three - neutrino model .",
    "since a good compromise between determining sgn(@xmath28 ) and establishing the existence of @xmath4 violation is obtained when both experiments are tuned so that the @xmath62 terms in the average probabilities approximately vanish , knowledge of @xmath46 would be helpful for the optimal design for the experiments .",
