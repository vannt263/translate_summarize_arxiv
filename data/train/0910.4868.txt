    "hypernuclei , where one or two nucleons ( @xmath6 ) are replaced by hyperons ( @xmath7 ) in the bound orbits , provide a unique opportunity for studying a new form of the hadronic system which has strangeness degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "lambda ( @xmath8 ) hypernuclei are the most familiar and extensively investigated hypernuclear systems .",
    "since the @xmath8 hyperon does not suffer from pauli blocking by other nucleons , it can penetrate deep inside the nucleus and form deeply bound hypernuclear states .",
    "thus , hypernuclei can provide information about the nuclear states which are not accessible in ordinary nuclei .",
    "such systems are perhaps the only tool currently available to get information about the @xmath8-@xmath6 interaction as @xmath8-nucleon scattering experiments are very difficult to perform due to short life time of the @xmath8 particle . during the past years , data on hypernuclear spectroscopy have been used extensively to extract information about the hyperon - nucleon interaction within a variety of theoretical approaches ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "@xmath8 hypernuclei have been studied extensively by the stopped as well as the in - flight @xmath9 reaction ( see , e.g. , the reviews  @xcite ) and also by the @xmath10 reaction  @xcite . the kinematical properties of the @xmath9 reaction allow only a small momentum transfer to the nucleus ( at forward angles ) , thus there is a large probability of populating @xmath8-substitutional states ( @xmath8 assumes the same orbital angular momentum as that of the neutron being replaced by it ) .",
    "on the other hand , in the @xmath10 reaction the momentum transfer is larger than the nuclear fermi momentum",
    ". therefore , this reaction can populate states with the configuration of an outer neutron hole and a @xmath8 hyperon in a series of orbits covering all the bound states having high spin natural parity configurations .",
    "the richness of the spectroscopic information on @xmath8 bound states in the @xmath10 reaction was demonstrated in the experiments performed at the brookhaven national lab and national laboratory for high energy physics ( kek ) ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for a comprehensive review ) . furthermore , although the reaction cross section of the strangeness production , via the @xmath10 process , is smaller than that of the strangeness exchange reaction @xmath9 , the higher luminosity of pion beams makes experiments more feasible .    in the experimental studies reported in refs .",
    "@xcite , this reaction has been used to carry out the spectroscopic investigations of hypernuclei ranging from light mass @xmath11c , to medium mass @xmath12v and @xmath13y with the best resolution ( @xmath14@xmath15mev ) achieved in the spectrometer at kek .",
    "this experiment has succeeded in clearly observing a characteristic fine structure in heavy systems by precisely obtaining a series of @xmath8 single - particle states in a wide range of excitation energies .",
    "most of the theoretical models used so far to describe the @xmath10 reaction employ a non - relativistic distorted wave impulse approximation ( dwia ) framework  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a comprehensive review of these models ) . in these calculations ,",
    "the @xmath8 bound states are generated by solving the schrdinger equation with woods ",
    "saxon or harmonic oscillator potentials .",
    "however , for processes involving momentum transfers of typically @xmath16mev / c or more , a non - relativistic treatment of the corresponding wave functions may not be adequate as in this region the lower component of the dirac spinor is no longer negligible in comparison to its upper component ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .     reaction .",
    "the elliptic shaded area represent the optical model interactions in the incoming and outgoing channels . ]    in this paper , we study the a@xmath17a reaction within a fully covariant model by retaining the field theoretical structure of the interaction vertices and by treating the baryons as dirac particles . in this model ,",
    "the kaon production proceeds via the collision of the projectile pion with one of the target nucleons .",
    "this excites intermediate baryon resonance states ( @xmath1 ) which decay into a kaon and a @xmath8 hyperon .",
    "the hyperon is captured in the respective nuclear orbit while the kaon rescatters onto its mass shell ( see fig .  [ fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "a similar picture has been used to describe the @xmath18 and @xmath19 reactions in refs .",
    "@xcite . in our model ,",
    "the intermediate resonance states included are @xmath1(1650)[@xmath20 , @xmath1(1710)[@xmath21 , and @xmath1(1720)[@xmath22 which have dominant branching ratios for the decay to the @xmath23 channel  @xcite .",
    "terms corresponding to the interference among various resonance excitations are included in the total reaction amplitude .    in section  [ chap : model ]",
    ", we present the details of our formalism for calculating the amplitudes corresponding to the diagrams shown in figure  [ fig : fig1 ] . in section  [ chap : results ] , numerical results are presented for the @xmath10 reaction on @xmath2c , @xmath3ca , @xmath4v and @xmath5y targets using continuum wave functions in the plane wave approximation .",
    "summary , conclusions and future outlook of our work are given in section  [ chap : summary ] .",
    "the structure of our model for the @xmath10 reaction is described in fig .  [",
    "fig : fig1 ] .",
    "the @xmath1 corresponds to the @xmath25 $ ] , @xmath26 $ ] , and @xmath27 $ ] baryon resonance intermediate states .",
    "terms corresponding to interference between various amplitudes are retained . the elementary process involved in this reaction",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "it is clear that our model has only @xmath28-channel resonance contributions . in principle ,",
    "born terms and the resonance contributions in @xmath29- and @xmath30-channels should also be included in description of both the processes depicted by figs .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] and  [ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "these graphs constitute the non - resonant background terms .",
    "their magnitudes depend on particular models used to calculate them and also the parameters used in those models .",
    "this can be seen in ref .",
    "@xcite where the effect of the background terms is studied for @xmath31 phase shifts in the pion - nucleon interaction . whereas the contributions of the background terms are about @xmath32@xmath33 of the resonance terms within a coupled - channel @xmath34 matrix model , they are limited to less than @xmath35 in the model of ref .",
    "@xcite for the energies of our interest ( @xmath36gev / nucleon ; the corresponding invariant mass is about @xmath15gev ) ( see fig .  15 of  @xcite ) .",
    "the effect of the background terms on the total production cross sections of the @xmath37 reaction at our beam energies can be indirectly inferred from the calculations reported in ref .",
    "it is seen in fig .  2 of this reference that the total production cross sections at invariant mass around @xmath15gev are dominated by the contributions of @xmath31 and @xmath38 resonance terms . therefore , the magnitudes of the background terms are likely to be limited to about @xmath39@xmath33 of those of the resonance terms .",
    "our results reported later on in this paper may be uncertain by @xmath39@xmath33 due to omission of the background contributions .          for the interaction terms of the spin-@xmath40 resonances , we have vertices of _ pseudoscalar _ ( ps ) or _ pseudovector _ ( pv ) form .",
    "the pseudovector coupling is consistent with the chiral symmetry requirement of the fundamental theory of strong interactions ( quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) ) .",
    "in contrast to that , the pseudoscalar one does not have this property , but it is easier to calculate .",
    "the couplings are in both cases fixed in such a way that they are equal on - shell ; for off - shell cases , their difference is suppressed due to the denominator of the resonance propagator .",
    "it is , therefore , arguable which lagrangian to use .",
    "the best approach would be to introduce a mixing parameter , which was investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite .    to avoid the introduction of additional parameters in our model due to a ps - pv mixing for the interaction lagrangians of refs .",
    "@xcite , we use the convention of either choosing the ps or the pv couplings for these vertices as done in refs .",
    "this is in line with the studies reported in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the pseudoscalar interaction lagrangians for the spin-@xmath40 resonances are given by    [ eq : lag.ps ] @xmath41    where the @xmath42 takes care of parity conservation .",
    "we use @xmath43 and h.  c.  in eqs .",
    "denotes the _",
    "hermitian conjugate_.    the pseudovector lagrangians involve the derivative of the pion wave function rather than the wave function itself .",
    "this introduces an additional mass dimension , which is taken care of by a `` rescaling '' of the coupling constant .",
    "it also ensures the matching of the on - shell behaviour the two types of lagrangians .",
    "the pseudovector lagrangians are given by    [ eq : lag.pv ] @xmath44    where @xmath42 is given by @xmath45 and the upper and lower signs are used for even and odd parity resonances , respectively .",
    "the spin-@xmath46 resonance lagrangians are given by    [ eq : lag.32 ] @xmath47    such a form of the coupling was used for studying the hypernuclear production also in other reactions  @xcite .",
    "the values and signs of the various coupling constants have been taken from refs .",
    "@xcite and are shown in table  [ tab : couplings ] .",
    "these parameters describe well the associated @xmath48 production in proton - proton collisions within a similar resonance picture .",
    "all the pion - resonance - kaon vertices that are of interest in this paper are involved in this reaction .",
    "thus the vertex parameters used by us inherently describe the elementary process shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] .",
    ".coupling constants for various vertices used in the calculations . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we see that the distortion effects in the incident channel lead to the reduction of the peak cross sections by factors of @xmath49 to @xmath50 as the target mass varies from @xmath50 to @xmath51 .",
    "our result for the @xmath2c target is in contrast to that of the non - relativistic impulse model of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the distortion effects were found to reduce the differential cross section by about an order of magnitude for this target .",
    "the distortion effects play an increasingly important role with increasing mass of the target nucleus .",
    "this result is in agreement with those of refs  @xcite , and  @xcite .",
    "in summary , we studied the @xmath52 reaction on @xmath2c , @xmath3ca , @xmath4v and @xmath5y targets within a fully covariant model , where in the initial collision of incident pion with one of the target nucleons the @xmath1(1650 ) , @xmath1(1710 ) , and @xmath1(1720 ) intermediate baryon resonance states are excited which subsequently propagate and decay into the relevant channel .",
    "we have retained the full field theoretic forms of various interaction vertices and obtained the baryon bound states by solving the dirac equation with appropriate scalar and vector potentials .",
    "the vertex constants were taken to be the same as those determined in previous studies .",
    "we have ignored , for the time being , the distortion effects in the incident and outgoing channels as our main aim in this paper has been to establish a fully covariant model for this reaction which has so far been described only within a non - relativistic distorted wave impulse approximation picture . the plane wave approximation facilitates the application of this novel approach to very many cases without requiring lengthy and cumbersome computations which are necessarily involved in the distorted wave methods .",
    "we find that excitations of @xmath1(1650 ) , and @xmath1(1710 ) resonant states dominate the cross sections for the @xmath10 reaction for beam energies below @xmath53gev .",
    "our model describes well the shapes of the experimental angular distributions for two states which corresponds to the prominent peaks in the @xmath54c spectrum .",
    "the total cross sections show a substantial dependence on the beam energy with a distinct peak around @xmath55gev for reactions on both @xmath2c and @xmath3ca targets .",
    "the differential cross sections peak near zero degrees for both light mass as well as heavier targets .",
    "thus , measurements at forward angles and at beam energies around @xmath56gev are expected to have high yields .",
    "the characteristic bump structures reflecting the @xmath8 major shell orbits as seen in the spectra of the @xmath57v and @xmath58y hypernuclei were reproduced reasonably well by our model . however , for a quantitative description of the spectra , more realistic calculations with configuration mixed @xmath8 particle , neutron hole states are required .",
    "mixing of the different parity states within a given particle - hole configuration may also be needed .",
    "our work shows that it is indeed feasible to have a fully covariant description of the hypernuclear production via the @xmath10 reaction . in future studies",
    ", the structure aspects of the model should be improved .",
    "also , alternative covariant bound state wave functions  @xcite should be used in order to check the validity of the method used in this work to determine them .",
    "distortion effects in the initial and final channels are required in order to have more reliable predictions of the absolute magnitudes of the cross sections .",
