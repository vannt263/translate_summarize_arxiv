    "fast - moving massive field stars in our galaxy and in external galaxies , that apparently are not associated with any nearby stellar assemblies , have been a focal topic for the past two decades .",
    "such runaway ob stars are widely thought to be members of star clusters that are ejected following dynamical encounters in their parent clusters .",
    "if the proper motions of these massive stars can be reliably estimated , the vast majority of them can then be traced back to their parent clusters . using this kinematic method , @xcite have demonstrated that most of the galactic ob runaway stars indeed originated from star clusters . another way to determine",
    "the parents of runaway massive stars is to image their bow shocks , if present , which has been possible with modern infrared telescopes @xcite .",
    "a detectable bow shock is generated if a star moves supersonically ( typically @xmath1 km s@xmath2 ) through a dense enough medium .",
    "the geometry of a bow shock allows one to determine the direction of motion of the shock - generating star and hence its possible parent cluster @xcite .",
    "bow shocks are particularly useful when the proper motions of the runaway ob stars are unavailable or are poorly known which is often the case for distant stars . however , even if every ob field star has been ejected from a young cluster , 1 - 4% of the ob stars can not be traced back to their parent clusters because of the two - step ejection process @xcite : a massive binary is first ejected from its cluster and when the primary explodes as a supernova , the secondary ob star continues on a diverted trajectory .",
    "high - velocity single and binary stars are launched from a star cluster due to super - elastic single - star ",
    "binary and binary - binary dynamical encounters @xcite that occur predominantly in the cluster s dense core . therefore , the spectrum of the ejected bodies is governed by the properties of the primordial binaries in the cluster @xcite and its stellar initial mass function ( imf ) and hence serves as a useful tracer of these fundamentally important cluster properties . as the stars and the binaries are mostly ejected from the cluster s core , where the most massive members remain segregated ( mass stratification ; see @xcite ) , the runaway population contains a large fraction of ob single stars / binaries .",
    "the ejection of the massive members also alters the stellar mass function ( mf ) of the bound cluster as it evolves .",
    "a particular runaway very massive star ( vms ) that has recently drawn significant attention is vlt - flames tarantula survey ( vfts ) 682 .",
    "this vms , visible in the tarantula nebula ( 30 doradus ) of the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , has an inferred present - day mass of @xmath3 and is located at a projected distance of @xmath4 pc in the north - east from the central massive star cluster r136 of the 30 doradus complex @xcite . from radial velocity measurements and its",
    "projected separation from r136 , @xcite inferred that the true velocity of vfts 682 should be @xmath5 km s@xmath2 if it is indeed a runaway from r136 . on the other hand , the apparent isolation of vfts 682 from any star cluster , its moderate peculiar motion and the non - detection of a bow shock ( but see @xcite ) might also indicate that this vms has formed isolated and is unrelated to r136 , as @xcite argue .",
    "the origin of vfts 682 is therefore currently unclear , _",
    "i.e. _ , whether it is a `` slow runaway '' from r136 or has formed alone , outside any clusters .",
    "this , in turn , freshens up the open question whether massive stars form only in dense environments @xcite or whether isolated massive star formation is possible through pure circumstellar disk - accretion @xcite .",
    "notably , the stellar content of r136 itself presents a challenge to the current understanding of star - formation phenomenology as it contains several single - star members with inferred initial masses upto @xmath6 , _",
    "i.e. _ , well above the widely accepted @xmath0 canonical upper - limit of the stellar imf @xcite . as coined by @xcite , the stellar population of r136",
    "is therefore `` super - saturated '' by containing super - canonical stars .    because of the important implications in massive star formation theory , it is essential to determine the likeliness of a vfts 682-like runaway from r136 . to that end , we compute the evolution of model star clusters with properties resembling r136 using the direct n - body integration method and focus on the kinematics of the massive stars ejected from them .",
    "we find that the ejection of vmss , within a few myr , with kinematic properties similar to vfts 682 is quite plausible : the latter star is then quite possibly a runaway from r136 and the substantially controversial assumption of isolated massive star formation is unnecessary to explain its existence .",
    "these computations also demonstrate that super - canonical stars appear naturally from merged binaries .    in sec .  [ comp ] , we describe our model clusters ( sec .  [ initcond ] ) and the method of our computations ( sec .",

    "as our primary objective is to study the runaway massive stars from a r136-like cluster , we begin our n - body computations with star clusters modelled as plummer spheres @xcite having properties conforming with the observed parameters of r136 .",
    "the present - day parameters of r136 still remain ambiguous .",
    "we take the total initial mass of each of our model plummer spheres to be @xmath7 which is an upper limit of the mass of r136 @xcite . as for its size ,",
    "a variety of half - mass radii / core radii has so far been assigned to this cluster by different authors @xcite .",

    "the initial masses @xmath12 of the clusters member stars are drawn from the canonical imf @xcite in the range @xmath13 .",
    "this imf is a two - part power - law with indices @xmath14 for @xmath15 and @xmath16 for more massive stars . throughout this paper",
    ", we denote the ( instantaneous ) mass of a stellar member by @xmath12 in general and @xmath17 is exclusively reserved to denote the mass of a runaway ( see sec .",
    "[ res ] ) member .",
    "the metallicity of the stars are taken to be low : @xmath18 which is appropriate for r136 .",
    "most stars form in binaries or higher - order multiple systems . furthermore",
    ", close binary - binary encounters play an important role in the dynamical ejection of stars from a cluster @xcite .",

    "[ nbint ] ) .",
    "thus , in order to achieve a reasonable calculation - speed , we initially arrange all the stars more massive than @xmath19 in binaries and all the less massive members are kept single . as our primary aim is to probe the _ massive _ runaway stars , which can be efficiently ejected only via close encounters with massive , hard binaries ( see sec .",
    "[ vfts682 ] ) , only massive binaries are important in this study .    to create the initial binary population , we first sort the @xmath20 stars with decreasing mass and then pair them in order , so that the resulting binaries have their mass - ratios close to unity .",

    "i.e. _ , @xmath31 @xcite . fig .",
    "[ fig : evm ] shows the resulting distribution of binary binding energies as a function of the primary mass .",
    "the two distinct energy distributions across @xmath32 are clearly visible ; the binaries with @xmath33 primaries are harder than those with @xmath34 primaries .",
    "the initial systems are completely mass - segregated @xcite using a method by @xcite so that the heaviest stars are initially concentrated within the clusters cores .",
    "such an initial condition mimics primordial mass segregation that is inferred to be true for several galactic globular clusters @xcite and young star clusters @xcite .",
    "notably , the initial setup employed here ( all massive stars in binaries , fully mass - segregated cluster ) are the very first ones ever computed under such extreme conditions .      the initial models , constructed as above , are dynamically evolved using the state - of - the - art direct n - body integrator `` nbody6 '' @xcite which takes advantage of the remarkable hardware accelerated computing capacity of a graphical processing unit ( gpu ) while integrating the centers of masses .",
    "algorithmically , the most important feature of nbody6 is that it applies regularization techniques @xcite to resolve close encounters , making them highly accurate and therefore uniquely suitable for this work .",
    "however , when there are a significant number of primordial binaries , their regualrized orbits can currently be integrated only on the much slower host workstation processors , which bottlenecks the gpu s hardware acceleration significantly . no external tidal field is applied during the n - body integration as the gravitational field structure of lmc is currently unclear .",
    "in addition to integrating the point - mass motion , nbody6 also employs analytical but well - tested stellar evolution recipes @xcite to evolve the individual stars .",
    "these prescriptions are based on model stellar evolution tracks computed by @xcite .",
    "the wind mass loss of all massive stars are taken into account using the empirical formula of @xcite , while they are on the main sequence .",
    "the mass loss rates are , of course , appropriately modified on the giant branches and other evolved phases for stars of all masses ( see sec .  7 of @xcite ) .",
    "the code incorporates the physics of stellar binary evolution as well @xcite .",
    "it also includes detailed models for tidal interactions between stars and recipes for the outcomes of mergers between different types of stars and stellar remnants ( see table 2 of @xcite for a summary ) .    since mergers among main - sequence ( hereafter ms ) stars have substantial consequences in our results ( sec .",
    "[ res ] ) , we summarize here the treatment of a merger between two ms stars in nbody6 ( which follows @xcite schemes ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "when two ms stars collide ( a collision between two single ms stars or between two ms components in a binary due to eccentricity induced by close encounters and/or due to encounter hardening ) , it is assumed that ( a ) the merged product is a ms star with the stellar material completely mixed and ( b ) no mass is lost from the system during the merger process .",
    "the no mass - loss assumption is based on the results of sph simulations of ms - ms mergers ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) but such calculations yield only a limited amount of mixing .",
    "the rejuvenated age of the merged ms star is determined depending on the amount of unburnt hydrogen fuel gained by the hydrogen - burning core as a result of the mixing . in case of a mass transfer across a ms - ms binary",
    ", distinction is made between the cases when the original accretor ms star has a radiative or a convective core . for a convective core",
    ", the core grows with the gain of mass and mixes with the unburnt hydrogen fuel so that the accreting ms star appears younger . for the case of a radiative core , the fraction of the hydrogen burnt in the hydrogen - burning core remains nearly unaffected by the gain of mass so that the effective age of the ms star decreases .",
    "the effective age is determined so as to keep the elapsed fraction of its ms lifetime unchanged .",
    "the initial cluster mass of @xmath7 in our models corresponds to @xmath35 stars . to our knowledge ,",
    "direct n - body computations with such a large number of stars , where the clusters are fully mass - segregated and all the massive stars are in binaries , are being reported for the first time .",
    "we evolve 4 initial models with the above @xmath36 , generated using different random number seeds , until @xmath37 myr .",
    "we take this age as an upper limit of the age of r136 @xcite .",
    "we do all the computations on `` nvidia 480 gtx '' gpu platforms .",
    "from the above computations , we trace the bodies that are ejected from the clusters during their evolution ( within @xmath37 myr ) . we consider a single - star / binary / multiplet to be a runaway member from its host cluster if it is found moving away from the cluster beyond @xmath38 pc distance from the cluster s center of density .",
    "although our primary focus is on the runaway vmss , we consider the whole mass spectrum of ejected stars as well .",
    "[ fig : ejsnap ] shows the projected snapshots of the runaways with masses @xmath39 , combined from the 4 computations , at @xmath40 myr and 3 myr evolutionary times .",
    "it can be seen that by @xmath41 myr there are a significant number of fast runaway vmss with total ( 3-dimensional ) velocities upto @xmath42 km s@xmath2 and a few fast vmss are already present at @xmath40 myr .",
    "all these runaways are on their mss and hence are ob stars .",
    "we note that the vast majority of the massive ejected members are single stars  only 2 of the massive ejecta from our computations are found in hard binaries .",
    "we shall discuss the multiplicity properties of the ejected stellar population in detail in a future paper .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that although our adapted canonical imf has a @xmath0 upper limit , our models yield single - star runaways with masses upto @xmath43 within @xmath44 myr , considerably exceeding the widely accepted @xmath0 limit",
    ". a few of such members are also found bound to each of our model clusters within the same evolutionary period .",
    "these vmss form when massive binary components merge as a result of encounter hardening @xcite of these binaries and/or eccentricities induced to them by close encounters .",
    "it is the adapted relatively small and narrow orbital period distribution of the massive binaries ( @xmath45 ) , conforming with the observed properties of o - type stellar binaries ( see sec .",
    "[ initcond ] ) , that makes such mergers probable , leading to the formation of single stars with @xmath46 . on the other hand , it is these hard , massive binaries that can efficiently drive the vms runaways ( see sec .",
    "[ vfts682 ] ) . in other words ,",
    "the possibility of the presence of runaway vmss naturally leads to the formation of vmss ( bound or ejected ) , in the course of the evolution of the cluster , with masses significantly exceeding the canonical upper limit , even though the cluster s imf is intrinsically canonical .",
    "therefore , the observed super - canonical vmss in r136 , with inferred individual initial masses upto @xmath6 , do not necessarily imply an imf with an upper - limit greatly exceeding the canonical limit as argued by @xcite : the @xmath46 single - star members can as well be accounted for as recent massive binary merger products .",
    "each of our computed models yields a few of such super - canonical single - star members .",
    "because of their substantial gravitational focussing @xcite , they are involved in very frequent close encounters with other massive binaries , thereby being vulnerable to being ejected from the cluster .",
    "three of our 4 computed clusters have produced super - canonical single - star runaways with @xmath47 and the most massive merger product has been ejected from 2 of the models .      to have an understanding of the spectrum of velocities with which the stars run away , we plot their 3-dimensional velocities @xmath48 as a function of their instantaneous masses @xmath17 at @xmath40 myr and 3 myr as shown in fig .  [ fig : mvplot ] .",
    "the data points from all the computations have been compiled in this figure , which are distinguished by the different symbols .",
    "we note two trends in this plot , _ viz .",
    "_ , ( a ) there is a lower boundary of the scatter in @xmath48 that increases moderately with @xmath17 and ( b ) the upper boundary of this scatter is independent of @xmath17 .",
    "these trends are vividly apparent from the plot at @xmath41 myr ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mvplot ] , lower panel ) where there is a significantly larger number of runaways .",
    "no well - defined boundaries can , of course , be drawn in this plot and the above mentioned boundaries are meant to indicate net trends .    to understand these trends , we first note that an ejected single star of mass @xmath17 and velocity @xmath48 can appear in two main ways , _ viz .",
    "_ , ( i ) it is ejected due to a kinetic energy ( k.e . )",
    "boost in a close , super - elastic encounter @xcite with a hard binary where no exchange of members has occurred ( a flyby encounter ) and ( ii ) it is ejected from a hard binary being replaced by a more massive star ( an exchange encounter ) . in both cases , the k.e .",
    "of ejection is of the order of the binary s binding energy , on average .",
    "the trend of the lower boundary can be understood by noting that a single star is likely to experience a flyby in a strong encounter with a hard binary ( most of them have nearly equal mass components in our model ) only if the binary components are more massive than the intruder , since otherwise the latter is likely to get trapped in the binary by exchanging with one of its ( lighter ) members .",
    "in other words , to recoil a mass @xmath17 in a flyby encounter , one needs a binary with components of mass @xmath49 .",
    "similarly , a star of mass @xmath17 can preferentially be ejected from a binary only by being replaced by an intruder of mass @xmath49 . since the ejected star , in both cases , will typically have a k.e .",
    "of the order of the binary s binding energy @xcite , we have @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the binary s semi - major - axis .",
    "hence the condition @xmath52 implies @xmath53 ; the smallest possible ejection velocity increases with @xmath17 , for a given @xmath51 .",
    "hence , the widest ( hard ) binaries in our model give rise to the lower boundary of the scatter in fig .  [",
    "fig : mvplot ] ( lower panel ) .",
    "indeed , the eye - estimated lower limit of the data for the lower mass ejecta can be well represented by a curve @xmath54 shown by the pink line segment in fig .",
    "[ fig : mvplot ] ( lower panel ) .",
    "this is also true for the massive end ; their lower boundary can be represented by another curve ( the green line segment ) but with the same proportionality .",
    "the discontinuity is expected due to that in the binary period distribution ( _ c.f .",
    "[ initcond ] ; fig .",
    "[ fig : evm ] ) .    on the other hand , the upper boundary of the plot is formed by the ejecta generated by binaries having the highest binding energies .",
    "[ fig : evm ] shows that the hardest binaries are also the most massive ones , as a result of our chosen primordial binary distribution ( see sec .  [ initcond ] ) .",
    "they can therefore eject stars over the entire mass range with k.e . of the order of their binding energy forming the upper boundary that is independent of @xmath17 .",
    "note that as an order of magnitude estimate , the highest binding energies are @xmath55 which yield @xmath56 .",
    "this indeed agrees with the highest @xmath48s in fig .",
    "[ fig : mvplot ] in terms of order of magnitude .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : mvplot ] ( lower panel ) it can be seen that the median of the ejection velocities ( thick black line ) tend to @xmath57 km s@xmath2 for the most massive runaways and the corresponding quartiles ( thin black lines ) span between about @xmath58 km s@xmath2 .",
    "taking into account the outliers with @xmath48 smaller than the first quartile in the massive end of the @xmath59 plot , these ejection velocities are similar to the inferred true velocity of vfts 682 @xcite .",
    "this result , therefore , already strongly indicates that vfts 682 is a typical runaway vms from r136 .",
    "the highest @xmath48 reached in our computations , however , exceeds 300 km s@xmath2 as can be read from fig .",
    "[ fig : mvplot ] .",
    "we further inspect that all of our computations eject vmss with kinematic properties agreeing fairly with those of vfts 682 , _ viz .",
    "_ , @xmath60 km s@xmath2 , @xmath61 pc and @xmath62 .",
    "such instances are shown in table  [ tab : tab1 ] .",
    "these results dictate that the vfts 682 is an expected , very likely runaway vms from r136 .",
    "as additional information to the reader and for convenience of comparison with observations , we provide the data corresponding to fig .",
    "[ fig : mvplot ] in the form of an online table ( table  [ tab : online2 ] ) .",
    "in addition to the 3-dimensional velocities and the ( instantaneous ) masses of all the runaways from all of our computations , we also provide the corresponding line - of - sight and tangential velocities and projected positions . for the aid of the reader in doing further analyses",
    ", we also provide the corresponding components of the positions and the velocities in an additional online table ( table  [ tab : online3 ] ) .",
    "another notable vms in the 30 doradus is 30 dor 016 which is also thought to be a runaway from the central r136 cluster @xcite .",
    "this star , located at @xmath63 pc projected distance from r136 , has a radial velocity of @xmath64 km s@xmath2 and its mass is inferred to be @xmath65 ( see @xcite and references therein ) . the possibility of # 016 having a close companion being quite unlikely as these authors conclude based on vfts multi - epoch spectroscopy , it is very likely a runaway from r136 .",
    "given that this vms is about 1 myr old @xcite , its projected distance implies a minimum of @xmath63 km s@xmath2 tangential velocity . combining this with its radial velocity , # 016 has at least @xmath66 km s@xmath2 3-dimensional velocity .",
    "two of our computations are indeed found to eject runaways with similar properties which are shown in table  [ tab : tab2 ] .",
    "it is very interesting to study the mass ( or spectral class ) dependence of the runaway members as it directly points to the pure dynamical nature of the ejection process .",
    "although the number of stars bound to the cluster decreases strongly with increasing stellar mass , more massive stars and binaries are more centrally concentrated due to mass segregation and hence interact with each other more efficiently and frequently .",
    "this causes the runaway fraction of stars ( defined as the ratio of the number of stars , within a bin around mass @xmath17 , moving away from the cluster at @xmath38 pc to the total number of stars in the whole system , _",
    "i.e. _ , including all the bound and the ejected members , within the same mass bin ) to increase with the stellar mass as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ejfrac ] , where the outcomes of all the computations are overplotted at @xmath40 myr and 3 myr . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ejfrac ] , the ejected fraction @xmath67 increases considerably with @xmath17 for @xmath68 but remains nearly flat and small for lower @xmath17 .",
    "this is probably an artifact of our initial binary population where only the stars with @xmath20 are in binaries and therefore are efficient in ejecting only those members which are more massive than @xmath19 .",
    "current technology does not allow us to perform direct n - body integrations of r136-type clusters in which all stars are initially in binaries .",
    "such computations are available only for moderate mass clusters @xcite .",
    "in the present work , we have computed the dynamical evolution of model clusters whose structure conform with the observed global properties of r136  the central massive cluster in the 30 dor complex of the lmc , using the direct n - body integration method .",
    "the evolution of the individual stars , chosen initially from the canonical imf with the standard @xmath0 upper cutoff @xcite , has also been incorporated and as well the evolution of the individual binaries .",
    "we focus on the ejection of massive stars from our model clusters which is a process that depends crucially on the properties of the primordial binaries in the cluster . for computational simplicity ,",
    "we have taken only the stars with initial masses @xmath20 to be in binaries ( see sec .",
    "[ initcond ] ) which are the only ones that are efficient in ejecting the massive stars .",
    "hence , the properties of the massive runaways are not expected to be affected significantly by the absence of lower mass binaries .",
    "recent observations of the r136 and the 30 dor region have raised fundamental questions regarding massive star formation mechanisms .",
    "in particular , the apparently isolated and relatively slow - moving single vms vfts 682 has raised suspicion that it might be an instance of isolated massive star formation ( @xcite ; see sec .",
    "[ intro ] ) .",
    "additionally , the presence of single vmss in r136 with inferred initial masses upto @xmath6 has questioned the canonical @xmath0 upper limit of the imf @xcite .",
    "the most important outcome of our computations is the confirmation that a `` slow runaway '' , with a 3-dimensional velocity similar to that of vfts 682 , is in fact the most probable type of ejected vms from a r136-like cluster ( _ c.f . _",
    "[ fig : mvplot ] ; sec .  [ vfts682 ] ) .",
    "in fact , all of our computed models yield one or more runaways with kinematic properties agreeing fairly with those of vfts 682 ( _ c.f .",
    "_ table  [ tab : tab1 ] ) .",
    "given such a likeliness of a vfts 682-type runaway from r136 , this apparently isolated star clearly does _ not _ imply isolated massive star formation and it is very likely a former member of r136 .",
    "furthermore , as explained in sec .",
    "[ res ] , massive , close binaries are necessary to dynamically eject vmss from star clusters , which , in turn , are susceptible to merge due to their hardening and/or eccentricity - pumping , by the frequent close encounters that they receive . as our computations show ( see sec .",
    "[ res ] ) , such massive binary mergers can easily produce single stars , within a few myr , with masses well exceeding the @xmath0 upper limit , even if the cluster begins with the canonical upper limit .",
    "our 4 computations have produced upto @xmath43 members and merger products upto @xmath69 are possible if the most massive binaries merge .",
    "therefore , it does nt seem to be a surprise that r136 has upto @xmath6 single - star members , given the large uncertainties in the stellar evolution models used to infer the masses ( see @xcite and references therein ) and the presence of these super - canonical vmss ( or the presence of a super - saturated mass function ) is _ not _ an indication that r136 was born with an imf having an upper limit that substantially exceeds the widely accepted @xmath0 limit .",
    "these vmss can as well be massive binary mergers .",
    "it is , of course , important to note that there are aspects in our assumptions and initial conditions that favor ejection of vmss and formation of massive merger products .",
    "first , the assumption of no mass - loss during ms - ms mergers ( see sec .",
    "[ nbint ] ) is an idealization .",
    "although sph computations indicate that no mass is lost during a ms - ms collision @xcite , the studied collisions are typically between low mass stars and such mass conservation is not necessarily true for massive ms - ms mergers .",
    "furthermore , the merged ms star can spin rapidly , even beyond break - up , in which case the net mass gain would be much smaller or nil .",
    "second , the assumption of a complete mixing ( see sec .  [ nbint ] ) is also an idealization ; it is possible that the denser helium - rich core(s ) preferably sink to the center of the merger product resulting only a partial mixing of unburnt hydrogen with the helium core .",
    "this would lead to a partial refuelling or rejuvenation of the merged ms stars s core and hence a smaller lifetime .",
    "in other words , the treatment of complete mixing maximizes the lifetime of the merged star and hence its probability of getting dynamically ejected and/or being observationally detected .",
    "although idealized , these conditions are those which can currently be adapted at best in a direct n - body calculation ; other widely - used direct n - body codes such as the `` nbody6++ '' @xcite and the `` starlab '' @xcite also utilize similar synthetic stellar evolution and merger recipes .",
    "third , the vms ejection and the massive merger formation are also facilitated by our adapted initial or primordial mass segregation ( see sec .  [ initcond ] ) .",
    "while the motivation for choosing this condition is indeed to maximize these effects , primordial mass segregation is inferred to be true for several galactic globular clusters @xcite and open clusters ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "an important outlook would be to study the effects of a varying degree of initial mass segregation .",
    "another ingredient that causes ejection of runaway vmss and the presence of @xmath46 vmss in our computations likely , is the presence of relatively close primordial binaries beyond @xmath33 ( see sec .",
    "[ initcond ] ) .",
    "however , such a binary distribution is in accordance to the observational fact that o - stars are generally found in close binaries .",
    "notably , the range of the o - star binaries initial orbital periods in our models is taken to be similar to the observed one @xcite . in this context , recall that we adapt a @xmath21-distribution that follows a single pik s law and also take the binary mass - ratios ( @xmath70 ) close to unity ( see sec .",
    "[ initcond ] ) .",
    "however , the @xmath21-distribution of o - stars in o - rich clusters is observed to follow a bi - uniform distribution in @xmath71 with the break at @xmath72 days ; there is a significant overabundance of binaries ( comprising 50%-60% of the o - star binary population ) for @xmath73 days ( see eqn .  5.2 of @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , their mass - ratios are found to be uniformly distributed between @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "a very important development would be to incorporate such more realistic distributions of o - star binaries orbital periods and mass - ratios .",
    "in fact , the @xcite @xmath21-distribution would even more strongly favor the ejection of vmss and the formation of super - saturated stars than the presently adapted distribution due to the overabundance of @xmath73 days binaries in the former distribution .",
    "this would , of course , be at least partially counter - balanced by the @xmath70-distribution ; the smallest @xmath70 gives a binary with a binding energy smaller by a factor of a few for the same primary - mass and semi - major - axis .",
    "it is , therefore , an essential outlook to study the net outcome of such effects .",
    "however , note that the gross conclusions , as obtained from the present models , are unlikely to get affected by these details since the range of @xmath21 and hence the range of binary binding energies are indeed taken to be similar .",
    "finally , note that the chosen masses of the initial plummer clusters are the upper mass limit of that of r136 ( @xmath75 ; @xcite ) .",
    "a lower mass limit of r136 is @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "this being only by a factor of two smaller than the upper limit , we do not expect that the results presented here would be affected significantly had we chosen the lower mass limit as the total initial cluster mass .",
    "a corollary of our above two results is that runaway vmss and super - canonical vmss ( with masses exceeding the canonical upper - limit ) would coexist , in general .",
    "of course , as explained in sec .",
    "[ res ] , the latter type of vmss can easily be ejected from their host clusters and may be found only as runaways .",
    "it would be worthwhile to search for other massive ( and young enough ) star clusters , in addition to r136 , where such super - canonical vmss exist and the clusters can be related to vms runaways at the same time . incidentally , the vms @xmath77 pup ( @xmath78 ) , whose kinematics indicate that it is a runaway from the vela r2 association , has recently been inferred to be a merger product of at least two massive stars @xcite .",
    "the main drawback of this study is the incompleteness of the primordial binary population .",
    "as already stressed earlier , the absence of initial binaries for @xmath79 is anyway unlikely to significantly influence the ejected stellar population for @xmath68 which justifies such a truncation for our purposes . the truncated primordial binary population , of course , has effects on less massive ejecta which are pointed out in sec .",
    "the purpose of eliminating the lower mass binaries is , of course , computational ease .",
    "the presence of binaries substantially diminishes the speed of direct n - body computations ( even on gpu platforms ; see sec .",
    "[ nbint ] ) and such computations with a full spectrum of primordial binaries ( _ i.e. _ , 100% primordial binary fraction ) of models of the mass that we use in this study ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath80 ; see sec .",
    "[ nbint ] ) are currently prohibitive even with the fastest available gpus and workstation processors .",
    "nevertheless , we wish to emphasize again that our computations in this study are the largest sized direct n - body computations of initially fully mass - segregated clusters in which all massive stars are in binaries reported so far , thanks to the remarkable boost of computing speed provided by the recent gpus ( see @xcite ) and to the efficient numerical algorithms of nbody6 @xcite .",
    "these calculations represent the first - time attempt to directly evolve a real - sized massive star cluster .",
    "an immediate improvement over our work is , of course , to explore a full primordial binary spectrum and the effect of their varied distribution functions which , we expect , will become plausible in the near future given the continuing remarkable algorithmic improvements of nbody6 and the availability of increasingly faster gpus . a more accurate structural modelling of r136 is also pending once its dimensions are more clearly settled ( see sec .",
    "[ initcond ] ) .    in conclusion ,",
    "our calculations imply that the observed vmss outside r136 and also its bound vms members are fully consistent with the standard paradigm of massive star formation exclusively in dense environments and following the canonical imf .",
    "hence , the observations discussed here can not be considered as instances violating these regimes .",
    "we are thankful to sverre aarseth of the institute of astronomy , cambridge , u.k .",
    ", for his effort in the continuing remarkable improvements of nbody6 and his gracious help during our computations .",
    "we are also thankful to keigo nitadori of riken , japan , for his developments that resulted in the exemplary hardware - acceleration of nbody6 .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee whose suggestions have improved the quality of the manuscript substantially .                                                                                                          .",
    "the binaries from the 4 initial models ( see sec .",
    "[ nbint ] ) are superimposed which are distinguished by the different symbols .",
    "binaries with primary masses @xmath81 are assigned significantly smaller and narrowly distributed orbital periods than the other group ( see sec .  [ initcond ] ) making the former ones significantly harder .",
