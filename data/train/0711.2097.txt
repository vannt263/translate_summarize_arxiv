    "dynamics of diffractive dis is conveniently described within the color dipole approach , @xcite .",
    "the incoming photon turns into a @xmath5 pair ( a color dipole ) , which experiences scattering off the target and then is projected onto the final meson @xmath6 .",
    "thanks to the lorentz - dilatation of the transverse motion inside the projectile , the amplitude for this transition can be written in the probabilistic form @xmath7 here , @xmath8 is the _ diffraction operator _ , which acts in the projectile fock space .",
    "in the @xmath9-space it is diagonal and is known as _ dipole cross section_.    practical calculations are most convenient in the transverse momentum space . in this approach , known as the @xmath0-factorization approach",
    ", the amplitude has form : ( v ) = e c_v 4 ^2 _ sfi^v__v;__v(p^2).[amp ] here @xmath10 is the lightcone momentum fraction of the photon carried by the quark , @xmath11 is the relative transverse momentum of the @xmath5 pair , while @xmath12 is the transverse momentum of the gluon .",
    "coefficient @xmath13 is the standard flavor - dependent average charge of the quark .",
    "the color dipole cross section is encoded via the unintegrated gluon distribution function @xmath14 . in our calculations",
    "we used fits of @xmath14 obtained in @xcite and adapted to the off - forward kinematics needed for the meson production , see details in @xcite .",
    "this approach can be used to calculate production of quarkonia in different spin - orbital states .",
    "the only requirement is that @xmath15 .    * ground state vector mesons ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) : @xmath18 . *",
    "radially excited vm ( @xmath16 , @xmath19 ) : @xmath20 ,  * orbitally excited vm ( @xmath21 , @xmath17 ) : @xmath22 ,  * high - spin mesons , e.g. spin-3 mesons with @xmath21 such as @xmath1 .",
    "the properties of the given meson appear in ( [ amp ] ) in two ways : via the radial wave function @xmath23 , and via the spin - orbital structure , which is encoded in an appropriate spinorial structure of the @xmath24 vertex , @xcite , and is present in ( [ amp ] ) implicitly inside the integrands @xmath25 .",
    "for example , for the @xmath26-wave vector meson the vertex has form @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the polarization vector and @xmath29 .",
    "the corresponding structure for the spin-3 meson is @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the polarization tensor and @xmath32 was derived in @xcite .",
    "let us first discuss the vital property of diffraction : _ it does not conserve orbital momentum @xmath33 of the @xmath5 pair_. indeed , symbolically the amplitude is l| _ | l = d^3 p l| _ |",
    "l = 0,[nondiagonal ] because diffraction operator @xmath34 is not spherically symmetric .",
    "namely , when calculating the diagrams , one observes that the transverse momentum circulating in the quark loop is much more important than the longitudinal one .",
    "this is the unavoidable consequence of the fact that any collision has a preferred direction .    since the incoming photon can be also represented as a coherent combination of various vector mesons , including radially and orbitally excited mesons ,",
    "see discussion in @xcite , one can , therefore , expect that orbitally excited and spin - excited mesons will be present among the final states in diffractive dis .",
    "orthogonality of @xmath5 with different @xmath33 suppresses the helicity conserving , but not the helicity violating amplitudes .",
    "therefore , a much stronger helicity violation is expected for orbital excitations than for grounds state mesons .",
    "numerical results are obtained by direct evaluation of amplitudes ( [ amp ] ) and integration of the differential cross section within the diffraction cone , @xmath35 gev@xmath36 .",
    "we took into account all helicity amplitudes , including all helicity violating transitions .",
    "r7.4 cm     ratios @xmath37 and @xmath38 as functions of @xmath39 .",
    "[ ivanovi_fig1 ]    the main sources of uncertainty in the absolute values of the cross sections are the choice of the parametrization of the radial wave function and the @xmath40 decay width , which is used to adjust the size of the wave function .",
    "our experience with ground state vm production @xcite shows that different choices of the wave function lead to results differing by factor of 2 .",
    "the results for the orbitally excited mesons are even more uncertain since the value of @xmath41 is known only within factor of 5",
    ". however , the relative production rates of @xmath42 and @xmath1 are more stable , within factor of 2 .",
    "1 shows the results for the ratios @xmath37 and @xmath38 as functions of @xmath39 .",
    "both ratios are @xmath43 and are comparable .",
    "since @xmath42 and @xmath1 are degenerate , this means that one must perform a very careful analysis of multipion diffractive final states in order to separate these two mesons .",
    "studying @xmath44 production in more detail , we found some other peculiar features .",
    "* numerical calculations confirm very large contribution from helicity violating transitions in @xmath44 even at moderate @xmath39 .",
    "we even predict _ domination of helicity violation _ at small @xmath39  a new regime in diffraction . *",
    "the radial wave functions of the orbitally excited mesons are broader than of the ground states .",
    "thus , typical dipole sizes in @xmath44 photoproduction are @xmath45 times larger ( up to 2 fm ) than for @xmath46 photoproduction .",
    "* @xmath47 ratio is abnormally large for @xmath44 .",
    "the cross sections for @xmath42 and @xmath1 production are of the same orders of magnitude , yet , the mechanisms of their diffractive production are quite different .",
    "we found this by performing , in the spirit of generalized vector dominance model , a coupled channel analysis of the action of diffraction operator in the fock space generated by three mesons : ground state @xmath46 , orbitally excited state @xmath42 and spin-3 meson @xmath1 .",
    "details are reported in @xcite .",
    "here we just show the matrix for the integrated cross sections and with the sum over all final polarization states : _",
    "ba = v_b|_| v_a= (    ccc 19 & 1 & 0.2 + 1 & 27 & 0.3 + 1.3 & 0.4 & 19    )  , v_a , v_b = ,  , _ 3 .",
    "the diagonal elements have uncertainty of @xmath48 , while the off - diagonal elements are uncertain within factor 2 - 3 .",
    "since the hadronic part of the incoming photon at small virtuality can be roughly represented as @xmath49 , one can conclude that    * @xmath42 is produced mostly via `` direct materialization '' of the @xmath26-wave component of the photon followed by diagonal scattering , @xmath50 .",
    "* @xmath1 is produced via truly off - diagonal transition @xmath51 .",
    "* thus , @xmath52 and @xmath44 probe _ different properties of diffraction_.",
    "in contrast to the ground state vector meson production , @xcite , the data on excited vm , in particular , on the orbitally or spin - excited mesons , are very scarce .",
    "for example , the only published data on excited @xmath1 go back to 1986 , when the fixed - target experiment omega at cern measured it in diffractive multipion photoproduction , @xcite .",
    "modern era experiments , both collider or fixed target , have great potential in making much progress in this field .",
    "what one needs is to study diffractive multipion production and extract the resonant contribution .",
    "one broad peak at @xmath53 gev should be separated into three excited @xmath46 states : @xmath54 , @xmath42 , and @xmath1 .",
    "specifically , the best tool to extract the @xmath44 contribution would be the partial - wave analysis .",
    "we expect that the most sensitive to the @xmath44 would be @xmath55 final state at not too small @xmath4 , say , at @xmath56 gev@xmath36 .",
    "one can try to see the @xmath44 by comparing multipion spectra in diffractive production and in @xmath40 annihilation experiments , since @xmath44 is present in diffraction but absent in the annihilation .",
    "preliminary analysis @xcite gave interesting results .",
