    "in the last few years considerable research effort has been invested in developing appropriately engineered structures that display novel transport properties not found in nature . in the thermal transport framework , this activity has recently started to gain a lot of attention . apart from the purely academic reasons ,",
    "there is a growing consensus on its practical implications in the efforts of the society to manage its energy resources efficiently .",
    "thus research programs that aim to propose new methods , designs or materials that allow to harness and mold the heat flow at the nanoscale level in ways that can affect society s energy consumption needs are at the forefront of the research agenda . some of the targets that are within our current nanotechnology capabilities include the generation of nanoscale heat - voltage converters , thermal transistors and rectifiers , nanoscale radiation detectors , heat pumps and even thermal logic gates @xcite .    in spite of these efforts",
    "the understanding of thermal transport and more importantly the manipulation of heat current is still in its infancy .",
    "this becomes more obvious if one compares with the tremendous achievements of the last fifty years in understanding and managing electron transport .",
    "in contrast , for example , the important problem of thermal rectification is addressed only by a handful of researchers .",
    "the majority of these proposals relies on the interplay of system non - linearities with structural asymmetries @xcite . at the nanoscale limit where the phonon mean - free path is comparable to the size of the devices the inherent nonlinearities are irrelevant and transport",
    "is fully dominated by ballistic phonon transport ( ballistic limit ) .",
    "however recently it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that in the ballistic regime one can achieve thermal rectification under very specific conditions : low temperature limit associated with quantum harmonic systems in the nonlinear response domain , and the presence of a third reservoir which acts as a probe and it is coupled asymmetrically with the rest of the system in order to break any spatial symmetry . the importance of asymmetry of the system itself was further highlighted in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in this paper we focus on the development of a new concept for the creation of unidirectional thermal valves that control and direct heat currents on the nanoscale level .",
    "specifically we propose to create a ballistic symmetric thermal rectifier which relies on coriolis forces .",
    "in contrast to previous studies our proposal does not rely on any structural asymmetry . rather , an asymmetry is induced in a very controllable way by the coriolis force allowing a high flexibility in the rectification properties without a change of the structural setup .",
    "the system consists of a symmetric harmonic lattice placed on a rotating platform with angular velocity @xmath0 .",
    "the direction of heat current is controlled on the sign of @xmath0 , thus allowing for a reconfigurable heat current management .",
    "using the non - equilibrium green s function formalism we derive the conditions of optimal operation of the structure .",
    "subsequently we have verified these predictions via detailed numerical calculations using a simple variant of the proposed structure .",

    "the third bath acts as a probe and its temperature @xmath22 is adjusted self - consistently such that the net heat flux from it is zero . in general",
    "this can lead to different @xmath23 values in the forward ( @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) and backward ( @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) process .    for simplicity",
    ", the heat baths are described quasi - classically , i.e. we promote the relative momenta @xmath28 of the @xmath29bath particles and their displacements @xmath30 , with respect to the rotating frame , to conjugate canonical pairs @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we assume that the statistical properties of the phonons in these thermal reservoirs are not affected by the coriolis force and respect quantum statistics @xcite .",
    "the three baths , each consisting of an infinite number of harmonically coupled bath particles , are discribed by hamiltonians @xmath31 with a ( semi - infinite ) harmonic force matrix @xmath32 contains additional @xmath33 terms due to the centrifugal force ( @xmath34 denotes the semi - infinite identity matrix ) .",

    "these data clearly demonstrate that the rectification effect is present once @xmath1580 .",
