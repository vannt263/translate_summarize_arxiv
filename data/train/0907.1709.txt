    "the observation of the supernovae of type ia @xcite provides the evidence that the universe is undergoing accelerated expansion at present . combining the observations from cosmic background radiation @xcite and sdss @xcite , one concludes that the universe at present is dominated by @xmath6 exotic component , dubbed dark energy , which has negative pressure and pushes the universe to accelerated expansion .",
    "of course , a natural explanation to the accelerated expansion is due to a positive tiny cosmological constant .",
    "though , it suffers the so - called _ fine tuning _ and _ cosmic coincidence _ problems .",
    "however , in @xmath7 confidence level , it fits the observations very well @xcite . if the cosmological constant is not a real constant but is time variable , the fine tuning and cosmic coincidence problems can be removed .",
    "in fact , this possibility was considered in the past years .",
    "in particular , the dynamic vacuum energy density based on holographic principle was investigated extensively @xcite . according to the holographic principle , the number of degrees of freedom in a bounded system should be finite and has relations with the area of its boundary . by applying the principle to cosmology , one can obtain the upper bound of the entropy contained in the universe . for a system with size @xmath8 and uv cut - off @xmath9 without decaying into a black hole , it is required that the total energy in a region of size @xmath8 should not exceed the mass of a black hole of the same size , thus @xmath10 .",
    "the largest @xmath8 allowed is the one saturating this inequality , thus @xmath11 , where @xmath1 is a numerical constant and @xmath12 is the reduced planck mass @xmath13 .",
    "it just means a _ duality _ between uv cut - off and ir cut - off .",
    "the uv cut - off is related to the vacuum energy , and ir cut - off is related to the large scale of the universe , for example hubble horizon , future event horizon or particle horizon which were discussed by @xcite .",
    "the holographic dark energy in brans - dicke theory was also studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the standard and brans - dicke holographic dark energy models when the hubble horizon is taken as the role of ir cut - off , non - accelerated expansion universe",
    "can be achieved @xcite .",
    "however , the hubble horizon is the most natural cosmological length scale , how to realize an accelerated expansion by taking it as an ir cut - off will be interesting .",
    "furthermore , the _ holographic cosmological constant _ were discussed in @xcite , where a time variable cosmological constant comes from the holographic principle .",
    "inspired by the observation of the relation between cosmological length or time scale with any nonzero value of the cosmological constant @xmath14 , _ horizon cosmological constants _ were discussed in @xcite . in these two cases ,",
    "an accelerated expansion universe could be obtained at present , precisely speaking a scaling solution was obtained , when the hubble horizon was taken as the role of an ir cut - off .",
    "but unfortunately , non - transition from decelerated expansion to accelerated expansion can be realized in this scenario .",
    "this observation motivates us to consider the possibility of realizing accelerated expansion by mini modification of holographic or horizon cosmological constant model .",
    "this will be the main task of this work .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in section [ sec :",
    "tvc ] , we give a brief review of time variable cosmological constant . in section [ sec : hir ] , hubble horizon as an ir cut - off will be explored when @xmath1 is fixed constant and time or scale dependent respectively . in this section , cosmic observational constraint",
    "is also implemented . where the cosmic observations and constraint methods are put in the appendix [ app : constraints ] .",
    "conclusions are set in section [ sec : con ] .",
    "the einstein equation with a cosmological constant is written as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the energy - momentum tensor of ordinary matter and radiation . from the bianchi identity ,",
    "one has the conservation of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath17 , it follows necessarily that @xmath9 is a constant . to have a time variable cosmological constant @xmath18",
    ", one can move the cosmological constant to the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ee ] ) and take @xmath19 as the total energy - momentum tenor . once again to preserve the bianchi identity or local energy - momentum conservation law , @xmath20 , one has , in a spatially flat frw universe , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the energy density of time variable cosmological constant and its equation of state is @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is the equation of state of ordinary matter , for dark matter @xmath25 .",
    "it is natural to consider interactions between variable cosmological constant and dark matter @xcite , as seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq : conservation ] ) . after introducing an interaction term @xmath26",
    ", one has @xmath27 and the total energy - momentum conservation equation @xmath28 for a time variable cosmological constant , the equality @xmath29 still holds .",
    "immediately , one has the interaction term @xmath30 which is different from the interactions between dark matter and dark energy considered in the literatures @xcite where a general interacting form @xmath31 is put by hand .",
    "with observation to eq .",
    "( [ eq : rholambda ] ) , the interaction term @xmath26 can be moved to the left hand side of the equation , and one has the effective pressure of the time variable cosmological constant- dark energy @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the effective dark energy pressure .",
    "also , one can define the effective equation of state of dark energy @xmath34 the friedmann equation as usual can be written as , in a spatially flat frw universe , @xmath35",
    "horvat has considered a time variable cosmological constant from holographic principle @xcite , where the hubble horizon @xmath36 was taken as a cosmological length scale .",
    "the time variable cosmological constant is given by @xcite @xmath37 where @xmath1 is a fixed constant .",
    "as known , our universe is filled with dark matter and dark energy and deviates from a de sitter one .",
    "just to describe this gap , the constant @xmath1 was introduced . with this observation , @xmath1 can be named gap filling parameter .",
    "it can be seen that a @xmath38 constant is expected under the consideration of the energy budget of the universe .",
    "also , one can see that a de sitter universe will be recovered when @xmath39 is respected .",
    "now , the corresponding vacuum energy density can be written as @xmath40 which takes the same form as the so - called holographic dark energy based on holographic principle . with this vacuum energy , the friedmann equation ( [ eq : fe ] )",
    "can be rewritten as @xmath41 to protect a positive dark matter energy density , a constraint @xmath42 is required .",
    "immediately , a scaling solution is obtained @xmath43 substituting eq .",
    "( [ eq : scaling ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq : conservation ] ) , one has @xmath44 here , one can see a rather different result on @xmath45 from the standard evolution @xmath46 . in this case , the deceleration parameter becomes @xmath47 to obtain a current accelerated expansion universe , i.e. @xmath48 , and to protect positivity of dark matter energy density , one obtains a constraint to the constant @xmath1 @xmath49 the effective equation of state of vacuum energy density is @xmath50 under the constraint eq.([eq : cconstraint ] ) , one can see that a quintessence like dark energy is obtained .",
    "this is tremendous different from holographic dark energy model where non - accelerated expansion universe can be achieved when the hubble horizon taken as the role of an ir cut - off @xcite .",
    "also , it is easily see that the de sitter universe will be recovered when @xmath39 is respected .",
    "once the constant @xmath4 deviates from @xmath39 , a scaling solution will be obtained .",
    "it is clear from the above subsection that when @xmath1 is a fixed constant , non - transition from decelerated expansion to accelerated expansion can be realized . and",
    ", a possible remedy maybe make the constant @xmath1 not fixed but time or scale dependent .",
    "a time variable @xmath1 was considered in @xcite to solve the coincidence problem .",
    "so , we assume that @xmath1 is time variable or scale dependent , i.e , @xmath51 as that of @xmath1 a fixed constant case , one also has the relation @xmath52 also , to protect energy density of cold dark matter from negativity , the constraint @xmath53 is required . from the conservation equation of cold dark matter eq .",
    "( [ eq : rhom ] ) and the friedmann equation , one has @xmath54 to solve the eq .",
    "( [ eq : hz ] ) , one has to assume some concrete forms of the parameter @xmath55 . after simple calculation",
    ", one also has the same form of the deceleration parameter as the case of the fixed constant @xmath1 @xmath56 one can easily find that once @xmath57 is time or scale dependent , the possible transition from deceleration expansion to accelerated expansion can be realized .",
    "however , one will derive a different form of effective eos of the time variable cc in the case of time or scale dependence of parameter @xmath1 @xmath58 here , an extra term enters in the effective eos and can make the eos cross the cc boundary and be phantom - like at present .",
    "also , by the definition of dimensionless energy density of time variable cc @xmath59 , one obtains the simple form @xmath60 obviously , it is time or scale dependent as a contrast to the fixed constant @xmath1 case .    the next step is to give some forms of time or scale dependent parameter @xmath61 .",
    "however , unfortunately we have no any first principle and underlying physics theory to obtain the forms of @xmath61 at present .",
    "we only know that the constraint @xmath62 must be satisfied to have an accelerated expansion universe at present .",
    "also , the transition from decelerated expansion to accelerated expansion would also be covered potentially . and",
    ", the tension of parameters contained in the parameterized form of @xmath61 must be as looser as possible .",
    "in fact , we can reverse the process by giving some parameterized forms of the deceleration parameter .",
    "for example , we can assume the form of deceleration parameter in redshift @xmath63 as follows @xmath64 which has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "then , one immediately has the parameterized form of @xmath61 @xmath65 as required the condition @xmath66 would be satisfied at early epoch , when @xmath67 .",
    "one has the relation between @xmath68 and @xmath69 @xmath70 then , @xmath71 can be rewritten as @xmath72 taken this parameterization as a clue , an generalized form of @xmath73 can be assumed as the form of @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are model parameters which can be determined by cosmic observations .",
    "it is clear that our model is a one parameter model .",
    "also , one can easily has the expression of the deceleration parameter @xmath77 now , the eq .",
