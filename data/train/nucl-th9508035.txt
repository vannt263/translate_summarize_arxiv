    "the suggestion of goldman , henderson , and thomas  @xcite that the contribution of @xmath1-@xmath2 mixing to charge - symmetry - breaking ( csb ) observables is suppressed in the low momentum transfer regime has opened the search for new sources of isospin violation . since then , many calculations , using a variety of models , have confirmed the suppression of the @xmath1-@xmath2 mixing amplitude at small spacelike momenta  @xcite .",
    "indeed , it has been shown that the @xmath1-@xmath2 mixing amplitude is zero at @xmath3 in all models with vector mesons coupled to conserved currents  @xcite . yet , in refs .  @xcite",
    "no alternate mechanisms to @xmath1-@xmath2 mixing are proposed .",
    "the phenomenological impact of this gap must be emphasized : the csb potential from @xmath1-@xmath2 mixing  with the mixing amplitude fixed at the omega - meson point  accounts for some 40% of the difference between the neutron and proton analyzing powers ( @xmath5 ) measured in elastic @xmath0 scattering at 183 mev  @xcite . without this contribution",
    "the previous agreement between theory and experiment would be upset  @xcite .",
    "although the suppression of the mixing amplitude continues to be controversial  @xcite , sources of additional isospin violation are interesting in their own right and deserve examination .",
    "indeed , the aim of the present paper is to show that a recently proposed csb mechanism  based on isospin - violating meson - nucleon coupling constants  @xcite  is sufficient to restore the agreement with experiment .",
    "specifically , we examine the effect of these new sources of csb on the spin - singlet  triplet mixing angles ; these are the fundamental dynamical quantities driving @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "most theoretical efforts devoted to understanding csb observables use a nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath6 ) interaction constrained by two - nucleon data  @xcite .",
    "in such a picture , isospin violations arise from electromagnetic effects and hadronic mass differences .",
    "sources of csb can be classified in terms of three distinct contributions : ( i ) isovector - isoscalar mixing in the meson propagator , ( ii ) isospin - breaking in the nucleon wave function , and ( iii ) isospin breaking in the meson - nucleon and photon - nucleon vertices .",
    "rho - omega mixing , the proton - neutron mass difference , and the difference between the electric charge of the proton and the neutron are typical examples of ( i ) , ( ii ) , and ( iii ) , respectively .",
    "the existence of isovector - isoscalar mixing , such as @xmath7-@xmath8 and @xmath1-@xmath2 mixing , is well established .",
    "for example , @xmath1-@xmath2 mixing has been observed experimentally in @xmath9 measurements at the @xmath10meson production point  @xcite .",
    "however , the suggested suppression of the mixing amplitudes at small spacelike momenta lessens their impact on csb observables .",
    "this is , in part , why we consider other sources of isospin violation in this paper .",
    "isospin breaking in the nucleon wave function in a hadronic model is driven by the neutron - proton mass difference .",
    "indeed , it is through this mechanism that charged - pion exchange dominates  @xcite the class iv potential  @xcite at moderate momentum transfers .",
    "isospin breaking in the nucleon wave function can also arise in a quark model picture from the mixing of the nucleon to @xmath11 baryon states  @xcite . while undoubtedly nonzero , one expects the @xmath12 components of the nucleon to be small due to the large mass difference between the nucleon and the @xmath13",
    " the first @xmath14 baryon .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath1-@xmath2 mass difference is a mere 12 mev .",
    "thus , we turn to the meson - nucleon coupling constants as the possible sources of isospin violation demanded by data .",
    "while there have been calculations of isospin - violating meson - nucleon coupling constants  @xcite , their impact on class iv csb observables has only recently been considered  @xcite . here , as earlier  @xcite",
    ", we adopt a nonrelativistic quark model to calculate isospin breaking in the meson - nucleon coupling constants . in the model",
    "the coupling constants emerge from evaluating matrix elements of quark currents of the appropriate lorentz and flavor structure between nucleon states .",
    "the isospin violations arise from the up - down quark mass difference .",
    "radiative corrections to the vertices have also been evaluated and are found to be small  @xcite .",
    "here we study the phenomenological impact of ref .",
    "@xcite in greater detail . in order to do this",
    ", we estimate the @xmath15 dependence of the isospin - breaking found in the vertices at @xmath3 .",
    "we have organized the paper as follows . in sec .",
    "[ secivcc ] the model is introduced , and isospin - violating meson - nucleon coupling constants are computed .",
    "we show that in the @xmath3 limit the couplings depend merely on the spin - flavor structure of the nucleon wave function ; they are insensitive to the spatial components of the nucleon wave function . in sec .",
    "[ seccsbp ] we use these findings to compute the resulting csb potentials . in particular , we obtain a large contribution from omega - meson exchange to the class iv potential .",
    "we quantify the impact of isospin - violation in the @xmath16 vertex by computing the resulting spin - singlet  triplet mixing angles  these are the basic building blocks of @xmath5 .",
    "these results are presented in sec .",
    "[ secresults ] .",
    "finally , we discuss the impact of our work in sec .",
    "[ secconcl ] .",
    "we are interested in computing the coupling of an on - shell nucleon to the neutral mesons @xmath2 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 .",
    "the off - shell vertices could engender additional isospin breaking , but our primary focus is on the @xmath6 system , so that we will not consider these effects further .",
    "the exchanged mesons couple to nucleon currents of the appropriate lorentz character , and the meson - nucleon coupling constants emerge from evaluating the matrix elements of these currents in the quark model .",
    "the difference in the up and down constituent quark masses thus gives rise to isospin - violating meson - nucleon coupling constants . at @xmath20",
    "these couplings are determined from the spin and flavor structure of the nucleon wave function alone .",
    "in contrast , the couplings at @xmath3 of the nucleon to the charged mesons are sensitive to the quark momentum distribution as well , and are , therefore , more model dependent  @xcite .",
    "we shall consider the neutral - vector - meson  nucleon vertices first , as they are relevant to the @xmath5 measurement .",
    "the most general form for these on - shell @xmath6-meson vertex functions , consistent with lorentz covariance and parity invariance , are    [ vert ] @xmath21    where @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) are the isospin - averaged , phenomenological , meson - nucleon coupling constants , determined from fits to the @xmath6 phase shifts and to the properties of the deuteron  @xcite , and @xmath24 is the nucleon mass .",
    "we compute the couplings , that is , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , by assuming that the @xmath27 vertex functions can be related to the matrix elements of quark currents of the appropriate lorentz and flavor structure between nucleon states , computed in the nonrelativistic quark model .",
    "thus ,    @xmath28    [ vertex ]    here @xmath29 denotes a on - shell nucleon spinor of mass @xmath24 , momentum @xmath30 , and spin @xmath31 .",
    "we shall focus on the couplings at @xmath3 , where @xmath32 , as the nonrelativistic quark model is best suited to an estimate in the static limit .",

    "the isoscalar vector quark charge is @xmath37 , whereas the isovector vector quark charge is @xmath38 for the up quark and @xmath39 for the down quark .",
    "the charge assignments are made such that @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 , at @xmath3 .",
    "our model stems from the notion of vector dominance  @xcite .",
    "vector dominance presumes that a photon s interaction with a nucleon is mediated by the rho  or omega  meson .",
    "here we argue that the coupling of the vector mesons themselves to the nucleon can be determined via matrix elements of the appropriate isospin components of the quark _ vector _ current .",
    "our model does not predict the isospin - conserving coupling constants @xmath22 ; these must be extracted from phenomenological fits to two - nucleon data . however , the isospin - violating pieces , as well as the tensor - to - vector ratio , can be calculated within the model .",
    "note that the vector dominance nature of our model implies that the quarks couple to _ conserved currents_. we estimate the resulting coupling constants using the nonrelativistic quark model ( nrqm ) ; this is an additional assumption .",
    "the couplings @xmath43 and @xmath44 are functions of the meson four - momentum @xmath45 , though we shall focus on the couplings at @xmath3 . in this limit",
    "the couplings are insensitive to the spatial component of the nucleon wave function ; they follow directly from its spin and flavor content alone . in the @xmath46 limit",
    "@xcite , @xmath47 the neutron spin - up wave function , @xmath48 , is obtained by exchanging the up and down quarks in the expression for @xmath49 .",
    "the isospin violations arise from the difference in the up and down constituent quark masses .",
    "the couplings constants are obtained from computing the matrix elements found in the nonrelativistic reduction of eq .  ( [ vertex ] ) in the quark model ; _ i.e. _ ,    [ themodel ] @xmath50    note that we have introduced the quark magnetic moment @xmath51 , with the charges @xmath52 given in table  [ tableone ] . in the following presentation we discuss only the coupling of the nucleon to the @xmath10meson , as an illustrative example .",
    "our results , collected in table  [ tabletwo ] , include the couplings to the other mesons as well .",
    "the vector coupling of the @xmath10meson to the nucleon is determined by simply counting the quark charges :    @xmath53    [ model1 ]    the tensor coupling , in contrast , depends on the spin structure of the nucleon wave function :    @xmath54    [ model2 ]    it is useful to construct isoscalar and isovector combinations at the _ nucleon _ level ; i.e. , @xmath55 where @xmath56 \\equiv    \\left [ { ( g^{\\omega}_0 + f^{\\omega}_0 ) \\over 2 m } +          { ( g^{\\omega}_1 + f^{\\omega}_1 ) \\over 2 m } \\tau_z \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath57 the expression in eq .",
    "( [ omegaf ] ) is given to leading order in @xmath58 only .",
    "note that isospin breaking in the @xmath59 and @xmath60 couplings is realized in the @xmath59 _ alone _ and that the breaking in the @xmath2 tensor coupling is isovector in character . the @xmath2  and @xmath1  vector couplings are isospin - conserving .",
    "the isospin - breaking in our model is connected to that of the electromagnetic form factors through our assumption of vector dominance ; charge conservation protects the charge form factor from isospin - breaking at zero momentum transfer  @xcite .",
    "the tensor coupling is explicitly sensitive to the quark mass , as seen in eq .",
    "( [ themodel ] ) , and the isospin - breaking corrections are generated by the up - down mass difference . in the constituent quark model @xmath61  @xcite ;",
    "the up quark , which is lighter , has a larger magnetic moment than the down quark .",
    "henceforth we shall adopt the choice @xmath62 in reporting the coupling constants .",
    "our results are summarized in table  [ tabletwo ] .",
    "we now consider the isospin - conserving results .",
    "we find for the tensor - to - vector ratio that @xmath63 these results are qualitatively consistent with the @xmath64 ratios which emerge from phenomenological fits to the @xmath6 interaction  @xcite  recall that the bonn b potential parameters  @xcite , for example , are @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "this consistency is intimately connected to the nrqm s ability to describe the nucleon magnetic moments and to our assumption of vector dominance . in the nrqm , with @xmath67 ,",
    "the anomalous magnetic moment is purely isovector : @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "note that @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "these successes gives us confidence in using our model to compute the isospin - violating corrections to these coupling constants .    for completeness , we shall now consider isospin breaking in the @xmath72 and @xmath73 vertices as well . we exclude the @xmath74 vertex from this discussion because the @xmath75 coupling constant is poorly constrained by @xmath6 data  @xcite .",
    "the appropriate vertex functions are    @xmath76    we have assumed pseudoscalar , rather than pseudovector , coupling for the pion in order to be consistent with earlier calculations of charge - symmetry breaking  @xcite . in our model , we connect the vertex functions to matrix elements of quark currents , so that    @xmath77    [ vertexsig ]    where    @xmath78    [ scurrent ]    the charges @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 have been chosen such that @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 when @xmath85 .",

    "( [ thesigpi]a ) we see that the sigma meson generates merely a spin - independent coupling to the nucleon in the nonrelativistic limit , so that there is no isospin breaking in the @xmath72 vertex and no contribution from sigma exchange to the csb potential .",
    "thus , we will not consider sigma exchange further .",
    "however , the quark mass dependence contained in @xmath88 in eq .",
    "( [ thesigpi]b ) implies that the isospin - breaking in the pion case is finite .",
    "the breaking to @xmath89 is indicated in table  [ tabletwo ] .",
    "note , however , that the computed breaking at @xmath3 depends on the nature of the assumed pion - nucleon coupling . if we had chosen _",
    "pseudovector _ coupling , rather , then no isospin breaking would result .",
    "the pseudovector current contains no quark mass dependent pieces in the nonrelativistic limit .",
    "thus , our prediction in the @xmath90 case is decidedly more model dependent than in the @xmath91 and @xmath2 channels .",

    "@xmath199 is some 3/4 of @xmath150 , yet the above calculations show that the @xmath5 at 183 mev is essentially dominated by the @xmath3 physics . note that if one were to assume a momentum - independent @xmath1-@xmath2 mixing amplitude  @xcite and to include the contributions from omega and rho exchange an increase of almost a factor of two relative to the above mixing angle estimates would result .",
    "we have studied the charge - symmetry breaking in the @xmath6 potential arising from isospin - violating meson - nucleon coupling constants .",
    "the isospin - violating couplings are obtained by computing matrix elements of quark currents of the appropriate lorentz and flavor structure between nucleon states .",
    "we have used a nonrelativistic quark model to evaluate these matrix elements , yet our estimates at @xmath3 depend merely on the spin and flavor structure of the nucleon wave function , rather than on the details of the quark momentum distribution .",
    "thus , in the vector meson sector , for example , our model estimates at @xmath3 depend on our vector dominance assumption , but little else .",
    "we have also studied isospin breaking in the @xmath200 and @xmath72 vertices .",
    "no isospin - violations exist in the @xmath19 vertex at @xmath3 .",
    "we have found that the breaking in the @xmath200 vertex depends on whether the @xmath7n coupling is of pseudoscalar or pseudovector character  no isospin breaking results if pseudovector coupling is assumed .",
    "however , a pseudoscalar @xmath7n coupling is commonly used in studies of csb , and the breaking we find in the vertex is substantially larger than the breaking computed in hadronic models of neutral pion exchange .",
    "thus , any csb observable receiving an important contribution from @xmath7-@xmath8 mixing will also be affected by the exchange of neutral pions .",
    "we have found that omega - meson exchange is an important component of the class iv charge - symmetry - breaking @xmath6 potential needed to describe the analyzing power difference measured in elastic @xmath0 scattering at low energies .",
    "the potential which emerges from the isospin - violating @xmath16 vertex is identical in structure to that from @xmath1-@xmath2 mixing  @xcite .",
    "moreover , our estimates indicate that these two contributions  with the mixing amplitude fixed at its on - shell value  are comparable in magnitude and identical in sign at @xmath3 .",
    "models in which the vector mesons couple to conserved currents , of which ours is an example , have no @xmath1-@xmath2 mixing at @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "we have found that isospin - violation in the @xmath16 vertex can generate a csb potential of sufficient magnitude to fill the phenomenological role required by the iucf measurement of @xmath5 at 183 mev .",
    "the isospin - violating couplings we have computed at @xmath3 do not suffice to make a quantitative prediction of the csb potential needed for the iucf experiment .",
    "one must compute the @xmath15 dependence of the @xmath6  meson vertex as well  including that of the isospin - violating pieces .",
    "we have considered two simple estimates .",
    "the first is simply a prescription : we modify the `` point '' couplings by introducing hadronic form factors according to the bonn b potential .",
    "this assumes that the relative strength of the isospin - breaking potential found at @xmath3 persists at finite @xmath15 as well . in the second we compute the isospin breaking to @xmath155 using the spatial wave functions of the harmonic oscillator quark model and",
    "find the hadronic form factor for omega exchange needed to reproduce the isospin breaking computed to the above order .",
    "the use of the spatial component of the nucleon wave function is required here , so that this estimate is rather more model dependent than our @xmath3 results .",
    "we find that the use of the latter estimate yields slightly larger csb potentials .",
    "armed with estimates of the momentum dependence of the @xmath6  meson vertex , we have computed the spin - singlet  triplet mixing angles @xmath173 : these are the fundamental dynamical quantities driving @xmath5 . our @xmath173 computation is realistic as we have used the reid soft - core potential to generate the distortions in the @xmath6 wave function .",
    "we have computed the spin - singlet  triplet angles using three different sources of isospin violation : ( 1 ) @xmath1-@xmath2 mixing with the amplitude fixed at its on - shell value , ( 2 ) off - shell @xmath1-@xmath2 mixing plus omega- and rho - meson exchange , and ( 3 ) on - shell @xmath1-@xmath2 mixing plus omega- and rho - meson exchange .",
    "the first case , used in the original estimates of @xmath5 , represents a `` baseline '' value , as it fits the data .",
    "a csb potential of this magnitude accounts for a substantial fraction of the measured value of @xmath5 at 183 mev . the second case , which should be regarded as our best estimate , yields values for @xmath173 that are within 10% of those obtained with on - shell @xmath1-@xmath2 mixing , for the important partial waves . in contrast , case ( 3 ) results in a factor - of - two enhancement relative to the original calculation using on - shell @xmath1-@xmath2 mixing .",
    "two important results thus emerge from the present work .",
    "first , we have found a new source of isospin violation , namely in the @xmath16 vertex , which can fill the role demanded by the data .",
    "second , we have shown that insisting upon a @xmath1-@xmath2 mixing amplitude held constant at its on - shell value , after including the contribution from omega - meson exchange , results in a class iv potential too large to be consistent with the iucf @xmath5 measurement .    we thank v. dmitrainovi and s.j .",
