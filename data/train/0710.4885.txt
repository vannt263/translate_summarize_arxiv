    "when alexander first defined the multivariable alexander polynomial ( mva ) @xcite it was defined only up to sign and powers of the variables .",
    "it was shown by murakami @xcite that once a normalization and an appropriate change of variables is chosen , the polynomial is of finite type . in @xcite a recursive definition of this weight system",
    "was given , whose computation would take exponential time .",
    "we give a closed form formula using determinants , which would be computable in polynomial time .",
    "this explicit formula makes it possible to verify that the relations from @xcite which hold for the single variable alexander polynomial also hold for the multivariable alexander polynomial .",
    "a coloured link ( or chord diagram ) is a link along with a variable associated to each of the components .",
    "we will use the normalization of the multivariable alexander polynomial given in @xcite .",
    "this uses the matrix given by fox free calculus on the wirtinger presentation of the link , with the crossings labeled by the arc starting at that crossing . to compute the multivariable alexander polynomial one first labels all of the arcs , and then labels the crossings by the exiting lower strand",
    "this allows us to create a matrix with rows and colums indexed by the arcs .",
    "the @xmath0 row is given below .    2           [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     then once again we can delete the rows and columns corresponding to @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 . but note that there is no change in the @xmath4 column .",
    "so the contribution of the @xmath5 column is lost , this is equivalent to deleting the column associated to the marked chord .",
    "this is the matrix that was described in theorem 1 .",
    "as a test of this method , we wish to show that this function obeys certain known relations , such as the 4 t relation and the recursive relations in murakami s paper .",
    "each of these relations involve chord diagrams that differ only at one small area .",
    "this means that the matrix formed in computing the invariant will differ in only one block .",
    "the following lemma shows that the relations need only hold among certain minors of that block .",
    "let b be an @xmath6 block matrix of the following form , where a is an @xmath7 matrix , and @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath9    where @xmath10 refers to the matrix formed from the @xmath11 columns of a and @xmath12 refers to m with the @xmath13 columns removed .",
    "* proof : *    expand b along the rows of a using cofactor expansion , and collect like terms .",
    "+    let @xmath14 be matrices as in the previous lemma , with the same @xmath15 but different @xmath16 . to show a relation of the form    @xmath17    it is enough to show the relation holds on the appropriate minors the @xmath16 s .",
    "* proof : *    follows from previous lemma .",
    "+ when we wish to show relations between chord diagrams differing in a region , we note that the matrices used to compute their weight will be of the above form . using this lemma",
    "let us show the following relation holds .        to use the previous lemma we make both sides of the relation have the same number of arcs , so we divide the arcs in the left term in three .",
    "the matrices involved will be as follows .    2    @xmath18    @xmath19    for the first matrix in the example above the minors in question are as follows ;    2    @xmath20    @xmath21    @xmath22    @xmath23    @xmath24    @xmath25    the corresponding minors for the second matrix are , @xmath26 .",
    "you can see that the first are precisely @xmath27 times those of the second , so the relation holds .",
    "if we cross the chords we get the following two relations .",
    "+   + this allows us to derive the following useful relations .",
    "+     the first relation is a direct consequence of the previous . since it does nt matter how these components connect we can omit the connections from our diagrams .",
    "we can draw elements as in the second relation with the understanding that there will always be an even number of such elements in a diagram .",
    "obviously for more complicated relations we are unable to compute by hand all of the minors involved .",
    "the solution to this is to allow mathematica to do all of the computations for us .",
    "for example here is the computation that shows the 4y relation holds . +     using the previous relation we can rewrite the relation as .",
    "+     in the following calculation , we have used the substitution @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , and a common factor of @xmath32 has been factored from all of the matrices .    2    .... mat[1]= {        { 1,1,0,0,0,-1,-1,0,0 } ,        { -x , y,0,0,0,y ,-",
