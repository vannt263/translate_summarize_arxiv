    "they concluded that the excited quasiparticles must contain both spin and pseudospin flips in order to explain their results .",
    "in particular , the behavior of the activation energy could not be explained by a level crossing between skyrmion and a bimeron excitations .",
    "instead , the bimeron excitation , at the balance point , _ continuously _ transformed into a spin - skyrmion at high bias .",
    "this suggests the quasiparticles at these biases may be some object that interpolates between the two types of skyrmions .",
    "such objects have been studied in the field theoretic literature by ghosh and rajaramanrajaramancp3 , and more recently by ezawa and tsitsishvili@xcite , who dubbed these objects cp@xmath2 skyrmions . in this last work ,",

    "a possible explanation @xcite involves the inclusion of skyrmions in the groundstate when the system is doped away from @xmath1 .",
    "a single skyrmion has it spin aligned with the zeeman field at infinity , reversed at at the center of the skyrmions , and has nonzero @xmath26 spin components at intermediate distances in a vortex - like configuration . for @xmath27 which defines the global orientation of the @xmath26 spin components .",
    "_ et al.__@xcite showed that this extra @xmath28 degree of freedom leads to broken symmetry and hence to a spin wave mode that remains gapless in the presence of the zeeman field .",
    "it is the existence of this extra gapless spin mode in the crystal phase ( and possibly in some overdamped form in a skyrme liquid state ) that is believed to be responsible for the rapid nuclear spin relaxation observed in the experiments .",
    "our goal in this paper is to show that crystal states with some amount of spin depolarization due either to spin - skyrmions or cp@xmath2 skyrmions exist around @xmath1 , with lower energy than crystal states with maximal spin polarization .",
    "we show this by comparing the energy of several crystal states in the hartree - fock approximation .",
    "we study the spin and pseudospin textures of these states as the interlayer separation , the zeeman , tunnel coupling or the electrical bias are varied .",
    "because cp@xmath2 crystals must have a gapless spin wave mode , just as the skyrme crystal in a monolayer qh system has , this crystal state could be responsible for the fast nmr relaxation rate seen in the experiments of spielman _ _ et al.__@xcite and kumada _ _ et al.__@xcite .",
    "in addition , these hartree - fock calculations provide a check on the field theoretic calculations that have been used on the cp@xmath2 state@xcite . in the latter",
    "it is assumed that the many body wavefunction can be represented by a local 4-spinor with constant magnitude .",

    "3 , for example ) .     and @xmath307      to conclude this section , we look at the effect of a potential bias on the spin polarization . intuitively we understand that a cp@xmath2 skyrmion involves a twist  in some high dimensional space that is difficult to plot in 2d .",
    "that twist will occur through degrees of freedom where it costs the least energy , and the texture will vary slowly in sectors where the system is stiff . if we can change the stiffness of textures along some direction of phase space we can drive the texture into or out of that degree of freedom . a simple analogy would be to drive an o(3 ) model into an xy model by making excursions into the z - direction too costly .",
    "the behavior of this system with respect to bias illustrates this physics .",
    "we choose the parameters @xmath308 and @xmath309 so that , at the balanced point , the ground state is a spin - polarized meron crystal ( spb ) .",
    "our numerical results , plotted in fig . 9 , show that there is a transition first into a cp@xmath2 crystal and then into the ss state as the applied bias increases . the energy of the cp@xmath2 crystal interpolates nicely between the spb and ss phases as can be seen in the figure .",
    "the corresponding spin polarizations are shown in fig .",
    "the bias has the effect of inducing a linear spin depolarization of the 2deg in the cp@xmath2 state . in effect , the texture inducing the deviation of charge density from @xmath1 is being shifted from the pseudospin degree of freedom to the spin degree of freedom in a continuous way .",
    "note that the spin polarization varies only slightly with @xmath168 in the ss state .",
    "9(c ) shows the filling factor @xmath310 and @xmath311 in the cp@xmath2 state ( the exact same curves are obtained in the ss state ) . above @xmath312",
    "all the charge is transferred into the right layer and the spin polarization is that appropriate for a monolayer skyrmion crystal with filling factor @xmath313 and zeeman coupling @xmath314 and is then independent of the interlayer separation .",
    "we expect the marked decrease in the spin polarization with bias to translate into an increase of the nmr  relaxation rate with increasing bias .     or ss states and the spb state ; ( b ) spin polarization per electron as a function of bias for @xmath315 and @xmath316 ; and ( c ) filling factor in the right and left wells in the cp@xmath2 state . ]",
    "our numerical calculations show that crystals involving spin and/or pseudospin textures are likely candidates for the ground state of the 2deg in a bilayer quantum hall system around filling factor @xmath0 at small tunneling and for @xmath187 , we find intertwined spin and pseudospin textures ( cp@xmath2 crystal ) with a spin polarization that is strongly interlayer dependent while at higher tunneling , a symmetric skyrmion state with fully polarized pseudospins or another type of spin - pseudospin state minimizes the energy .",
    "as mentioned in our introduction , a skyrmion crystal has an extra gapless spin mode in the crystal phase ( and possibly in some overdamped form in a skyrme liquid state ) that is believed to be responsible for the rapid nuclear spin relaxation observed in the experiments__.__cotegirvinprl .",

    "the rapid change in the spin polarization that we found in the cp@xmath2 crystal state ( very small @xmath4 ) for filling factor around @xmath1 may explain the rapid change in the nmr  relaxation rate measured in the experiment of spielman _",
    "et al_. which was carried on at almost zero tunneling and for a zeeman coupling which is approximately that indicated in fig .",

    ", the spin polarization @xmath318 varies much less rapidly with filling factor than for cp@xmath2 crystal .",
    "moreover , the spin polarization does not depend much on the interlayer separation as can be seen , for example , in figs .",
    "3 . the results of kumada _",
    "et al_. showing a rapid change in the nmrrelaxation rate as well as a strong dependence on the interlayer separation would be more readily explained by a cp@xmath2 crystal state than by the ss state that we find .",

    "the evident continuous behavior is reminiscent of the kumada results .",
    "we speculate that the effects of finite well width , landau level mixing , and possibly disorder , all not included in our calculations , may stabilize the cp@xmath2 state at higher tunneling than was found for our idealized system .    in conclusion ,",
