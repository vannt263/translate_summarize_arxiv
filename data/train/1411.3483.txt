    "<S> a detailed calculation in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ( see also @xcite ) shows that this applies for @xmath71 for the following reason . </S>",
    "<S> while the states @xmath70 have the same kinetic energy , irrespective of the value of @xmath66 , the interaction energy explicitly depends on @xmath66 . in the deep wells of the lattice potential , </S>",
    "<S> the local wave function is the superposition @xmath72 , where @xmath73 and @xmath74 denote the wavefunctions of the local @xmath73 and @xmath74-orbitals , respectively . in analogy to hund s second rule in multi - electron atoms , the interaction energy is minimized if @xmath71 , because the superposition @xmath75 provides the largest possible mode volume such that the repulsively interacting atoms can best avoid each other . </S>",
    "<S> note that ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite also presents experimental evidence for the minimization of interaction energy . </S>",
    "<S> we hence conclude that in each lattice region and in each experimental implementation either of the two possible minimal energy states @xmath76 or @xmath77 is produced via a spontaneous breaking of the inherent @xmath9 symmetry associated with two possible signs of the chiral order . the corresponding wavefunction @xmath78 is illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3](d ) . in the deep wells , it possesses alternating local @xmath75 orbitals , thus maximizing angular momentum in each plaquette . </S>",
    "<S> the local phases are arranged to introduce plaquette currents breaking time - reversal symmetry and the translation symmetry of the lattice . </S>",
    "<S> our findings are supported by detailed calculations . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3](e ) we show the interference contrast calculated for the two cases of equal condensates corresponding to states @xmath79 in both lattice regions ( right panel ) and for different condensates @xmath76 and @xmath80 in the upper and lower lattice region , respectively ( left panel ) . </S>",
    "<S> these pictures reproduce the signatures of the corresponding data in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> details are deferred to ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    at higher temperatures , the correlations </S>",
    "<S> @xmath51 reduce and eventually , the distributions in the histograms in fig .  [ fig:3](b ) and ( c ) wash out . </S>",
    "<S> even at the lowest temperatures possible in our experiments some realizations give rise to distorted interference patterns with spatial irregularities , indicating the presence of excitations . some specific low energy excitations ( found in about @xmath81 of all implementations ) </S>",
    "<S> yield characteristic interference patterns , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:4](a ) . while the two outer interference gratings ( 1 and 3 ) are not notably different from those of fig .  [ fig:3](a ) , the inner gratings 2 and 4 show additional vertical nodal lines , highlighted by the two arrows . </S>",
    "<S> a zipper - like structure arises , more clearly seen in the high - pass filtered images shown in the bottom part of the graph . a theoretical analysis , deferred to ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , shows that this signature reflects the formation of two domains of different chirality in one of the lattice regions , while the other region does not carry notable excitations . </S>",
    "<S> these domains are nearly equally sized , and they are separated by a straight domain wall approximately aligned with the @xmath82-direction ( see fig . [ fig:4](b ) ) . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:4](c ) , an interference pattern calculated for this specific configuration is plotted , which reproduces the signatures seen in the data in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:4](a ) ( see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the observed vertical nodal line arises from the destructive interference in the @xmath83-plane of the matter waves emanating from the two domains of the upper lattice region during ballistic expansion , which is expected due to their phase difference of @xmath8 .    </S>",
