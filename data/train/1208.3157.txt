    "a key issue in the field of molecular electronics is the search for molecular compounds that give rise to new or improved functionalities .",
    "porphyrin molecules constitute in this respect promising candidates and are as such receiving increased attention .",
    "these molecules play an essential role in many biological processes such as electron transfer , oxygen transport , photosynthetic processes and catalytic substrate oxidation .",
    "porphyrins have been extensively studied in the past by biologists and chemists @xcite .",
    "however , an increasing number of theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite physics analyzes have appeared in the past few years .",
    "progress in the design of supramolecular structures involving porphyrin molecules has been rather spectacular @xcite .",
    "porphyrins are cyclic conjugate molecules .",
    "their parent form is the porphin , which is made of four pyrrole groups joined by carbon bridges and has a nearly planar d4h symmetry @xcite .",
    "the alternating single and double bonds in its structure , make this molecule chemically very stable . in porphyrin systems , the porphine is the base molecule , but different functional groups can join the macrocycle by replacing a peripheral hydrogen .",
    "in addition , the macrocycle can accommodate inside a metallic atom , such as fe ( which is the base of the hemoglobin in mammals ) , cu ( hemolymph in invertebrates ) , mg ( chlorophyll in plants ) , etc .",
    "large porphyrin systems can undergo certain ruffling distortions because of its peripheral ligands , its metallic atom inside or the environment @xcite .",
    "it is precisely the large number of possible configurations , which give rise to a wide variety of interesting properties that make these molecules very attractive for molecular - scale technological applications .    in this work",
    ", we present a theoretical study of the electronic and transport properties of porphyrins sandwiched by gold electrodes using density functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "the porphyrine molecule is attached to the gold surface by a thiol group and oriented perpendicular to it , as sketched in fig .",
    "( [ auphfe ] ) .",
    "the metallic atom placed inside can be fe , co , ni , cu and zn . for the sake of comparison",
    ", we have also studied the porphine compound , which has no metallic atom .",
    "since dft fails to describe correctly transition metal elements in correlated configurations , we have also adopted a dft@xmath0 approach .",
    "we show that the inclusion of strong correlations is necessary to accurately characterize the transport properties of some of the metalloporphyrin complexes .    the outline of the article is as follows : in section ii we briefly explain the dft@xmath0 flavor used in our calculations . in section iii",
    "we give the computational details and in the last two sections , iv and v , we present and discuss the electronic and transport properties of the junctions , respectively .",
    "dft has emerged as the tool of choice for the simulation of a wide array of materials and nanostructures . however , the theory fails to describe strongly correlated electron systems , such as embedded 3d transition metal or 4f rare earth elements .",
    "apart from the fact that even exact dft can not describe all excited states@xcite , the approximations included in the exchange - correlation potential induce qualitative errors in correlated systems . there have been many attempts to fix these problems .",
    "these include generating exchange - correlation functionals specifically tailored to the system under investigation , but then those are frequently not transferable .",
    "another attempt is based on removing the electronic self interactions introduced by the approximate treatment of exchange in dft@xcite .",
    "this unphysical self - interaction is a significant source of errors when electrons are localized .",
    "however it is not clear that just by removing the self - interaction error the physical description will be qualitatively correct .",
    "we will use in this article the popular dft@xmath0 approach , developed by anisimov and co - workers @xcite , that represents a simple mean - field way to correct for strong correlations in systems with transition metals or rare earth compounds .",

    "the dft@xmath0 method assumes that electrons can be split into two subsystems : delocalized electrons , that can be treated with traditional dft , and localized electrons ( 3d or 4f ) , which must be handled using a generalized hubbard model hamiltonian with orbital - dependent local electron - electron interactions .",
    "the dft@xmath0 functional is defined then as :    @xmath3=e^\\mathrm{dft } [ \\rho^\\sigma ( \\overrightarrow{r})]+\\nonumber \\\\ + e^\\mathrm{hub } [ \\ { n^\\sigma \\}]-e^\\mathrm{dc } [ \\ { n^\\sigma \\}]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath4 is the standard dft functional ; @xmath5 is the charge density for the @xmath6 spin ; @xmath7 is the on - site coulomb correction ; @xmath8 is the double counting correction , which is necessary to avoid including again the average electron - electron interaction that is included in @xmath4 ; and @xmath9 are the atomic orbital occupations corresponding to the orbitals that need to be corrected .",
    "the generalized hubbard hamiltonian is written as    @xmath10    following ref .",
    ", we take the atomic limit of the above hamiltonian where the number of strongly correlated electrons @xmath11 is an integer and write :    @xmath12    in contrast , for a noninteger occupation number , corresponding to an ion embedded in a larger system , we write :    @xmath13    the above two equations can be merged and after some algebra the dft@xmath0 functional can be written as    @xmath14    where @xmath15 .",
    "it has to be noted that the correction term depends on the occupation number matrix .",
    "this occupation number matrix , a centrepiece of the dft@xmath0 approach , is not well defined , because the total density charge can not be broken down into simple atomic contributions . since the appearance of the dft@xmath0 approach ,",
    "there have been many different definitions of the occupation number matrix @xcite .",
    "we evaluate the occupation number matrix by introducing projection operators in the following way@xcite :    @xmath16    where @xmath17 are the ks eigenvectors for the @xmath18 state with spin index @xmath6 and @xmath19 are their occupations . the choice of the projection operators @xmath20 is crucial , because due to the non - orthogonal basis set different projection operators give different occupation number matrices . in our case",
    ", the choice corresponds to so - called _ full _ representation . here",
    ", the selected operator is    @xmath21    where @xmath22 are the atomic orbitals of the strongly correlated electrons . introducing this projector in ( 6 )",
    ", we get :    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the overlap matrix and @xmath25 is the density matrix of the system .",
    "we have performed the electronic structure calculations using the dft code siesta@xcite , which uses norm conserving pseudopotentials and a basis set of pseudoatomic orbitals to span the valence states . for the exchange and correlation potential ,",
    "we have used both the local density approximation ( lda ) , as parameterized by ceperley and adler@xcite , and the generalized gradient approximation(gga ) , as parameterized by perdew , burke and ernzernhof@xcite .",
    "siesta parameterizes the pseudopotentials according to the troullier and martins@xcite prescription and factorizes them following kleynman and bylander@xcite .",
    "we included non - linear core correction in the transition metal pseudopotentials to correctly take into account the overlap between the valence and the core states @xcite .",
    "we also used small non - linear core corrections in all the other elements to get rid of the small peak in the pseudopotential close to the nucleus when using the gga approximation .",
    "we placed explicitly the @xmath26 and @xmath1 orbitals of gold as valence orbitals and employed a single-@xmath27 basis ( sz ) to describe them .",
    "we used a double-@xmath27 polarized basis ( dzp ) for all the other elements ( h , c , o , n , s and tm ) .",
    "we computed the density , hamiltonian , overlap and the matrix elements in a real space grid defined with an energy cutoff of 400 ry .",
    "we used a single @xmath28-point when performing the structural relaxations and transport calculations , which is enough to relax the coordinates and correctly compute the transmission around the fermi level in the case of gold electrodes .",
    "we relaxed the coordinates until all forces were smaller than 0.01 ev /  .",
    "we varied the @xmath2- parameter and the radii of the projectors of the @xmath2-projectors and compared the results with experiments or previous simulations of the isolated molecules . in this way we found that the optimal values for them were 4.5 ev and 5.5  , respectively .",

    "we carried out a study of the most stable position and distance and found , both in gga and lda , that the hollow configuration was more stable than the top and bottom , in agreement with previous results obtained with other molecules .",
    "the most stable distances were 1.6 / and 1.8/ for lda and gga , respectively .",

    "although the lumo is still formed by the same type of orbitals ( i.e. cu @xmath34 and n @xmath38 ) now changes its spin polarization and becomes populated by spin down electrons , unlike gga .",
    "the energy gap with @xmath2 is about 1.4 ev .    with lda",

    "such configuration is similar to that where a side state couples to a molecular backbone , which produces fano resonances in the transmission coefficients .",
    "the @xmath1 orbitals generate therefore fano resonances associated to one or various molecular states .",
    "if , for example , the molecular state is the lumo and the @xmath1 orbital is in the homo - lumo gap , the effect of the fano resonance is clearly seen because it affects the transmission in the gap , which has a large weight from the lumo .",
    "the fano resonance does not go to zero , however , because of the tails of the transmission of other molecular states . if , on the other hand , the @xmath1 orbital couples to a state below the homo or above the lumo , the effect of the fano resonance turns out to be much smaller because the transmission of such state does not affect the transmission in the homo - lumo gap .",
    "there is however one effect produced by the fano resonance , which is related to its peak .",
    "this peak has a transmission of 1 at the tip and therefore can be seen above the background of the transmission of other states .",
    "we can therefore confirm that the sharp breit - wigner - like resonances that are seen at different energies come in reality from fano resonances . in view of these results",
    "it is possible to conclude then that the fano features inside the homo - lumo gap are produced by @xmath1 orbitals that couple to the @xmath50 states , appear mainly on the lumo .",
    "one @xmath1 orbital responsible for such a feature is clearly the @xmath48 , as seen in fig .",
    "( [ fe.xz-yz ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the sharp resonances are generated by @xmath1 orbitals , such as the @xmath43 , that couple to sigma states above the lumo or below the homo .",
    "these features , specially the sharp resonance , appear in all cases and are a general characteristic of these molecules .",
    "we propose that the above - discussed metalloporphyrine molecules could be used as atomic or gas sensors .",
    "this is so due to the sharp changes in the zero - bias conductance that they generate when the fano resonances cross the fermi level , which should be altered whenever a given atom or molecules couples either to the metallic atom or to other parts of the molecular backbone .",
    "these resonances induce also differences between the spin - up and spin - down transmissions , which are specially important in the case of iron , cobalt and copper",

    "the previous behavior can be described with a simple model that takes into account the coupling of the molecular orbitals placed in the neighborhood of the fermi energy to featureless leads displaying a flat density of states , as well as the coupling of one of those molecular orbitals to the @xmath1 orbital responsible for the fano resonance@xcite .",
