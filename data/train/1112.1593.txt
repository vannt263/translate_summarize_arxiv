    "space - time block codes ( stbcs ) from complex orthogonal designs ( cods ) have been widely studied for square designs , since they correspond to minimum - delay codes for co - located multiple - antenna coherent communication systems .",

    "4 .   in distributed space - time coding for relay channels , rectangular designs appear naturally  @xcite .    a _ complex orthogonal design _ ( cod ) in complex variables @xmath10 is a @xmath11 matrix @xmath12 with entries @xmath13 , their complex conjugates @xmath14 such that @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the complex conjugate transpose of @xmath12 and @xmath17 is the @xmath18 identity matrix .",
    "the matrix @xmath12 is also said to be a @xmath19 $ ] cod .",

    "the importance of determining the delay of rate-@xmath8 cods has also been noted by adams et al  @xcite .",

    "in other words , lambda scaling ( where lambda ( @xmath52 ) is an integer greater than @xmath3 ) of a complex orthogonal design allows all the non - zero entries in a subset of columns of the matrix to take values from the set @xmath57 .",
