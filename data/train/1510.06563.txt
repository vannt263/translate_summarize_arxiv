    "most recently , @xcite obtained _ xmm - newton _ observations at energies of @xmath4@xmath5kev for 110 sightlines and inferred the x - ray temperature and surface brightness .",
    "they found the surface brightness to vary by one order of magnitude @xmath6@xmath7erg @xmath1 s@xmath2 deg@xmath3 , while the temperature had a rather constant value around @xmath8k .",
    "what produces this hot halo gas is currently not clear .",

    "other ideas invoke supernova explosions more than @xmath9pc above the galactic disk @xcite or hybrid cosmic - ray and thermally driven outflows @xcite .",
    "however , the relative importance of these different potential sources of the hot halo gas is unknown .",
    "recently , @xcite analyzed stratified box simulations of a supernova - driven galactic disk by @xcite and measured surface brightnesses that were two orders of magnitude or more too low compared to observations .",
    "the origin of this discrepancy is unclear , although @xcite discuss several possibilities .    in this letter , we study the galactic halo x - ray emission of simulations from the silcc projectsilcc/ ] @xcite .",
    "we model a non - equilibrium multi - phase interstellar medium using a time - dependent chemical network and include feedback by supernovae and cosmic rays ( section  [ sec : sim ] ) . in section",
    "[ sec : prof ] we show vertical profiles of the galactic winds .",
    "we create synthetic surface brightness maps ( section  [ sec : surf ] ) of the galactic halo and study the morphology ( section  [ sec : morph ] ) , surface brightness distribution ( section  [ sec : dist ] ) and time evolution ( section  [ sec : time ] ) of the x - ray emission . in section  [ sec : ebud ]",
    "we discuss the energy budget of the halo gas .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : con ] .",
    "we analyze simulations run with the ` flash `  4.1 adaptive mesh refinement code @xcite , employing a positivity - preserving magnetohydrodynamics solver @xcite .",
    "the magnetohydrodynamic equations are extended by a mono - energetic , relativistic cosmic - ray fluid @xcite in the advection - diffusion approximation as described in @xcite .",
    "parallel to the magnetic field , the diffusion tensor is @xmath10 , and in perpendicular direction @xmath11 .",
    "all simulations use a time - dependent chemical network @xcite , which follows the abundances of free electrons , h@xmath12 , h , h@xmath13 , c@xmath12 , o and co. dust shielding and molecular self - shielding are taken into account with the ` treecol ` algorithm ( @xcite , wnsch et al . in prep ) . in hot gas , we use the @xcite cooling rates and include diffuse heating from the photoelectric effect , cosmic rays and x - rays following the prescriptions of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "more information on the chemical network and the various heating and cooling processes can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we simulate stratified boxes with dimensions @xmath14kpc@xmath15kpc@xmath16kpc or @xmath17kpc@xmath18kpc@xmath16kpc and a grid resolution of @xmath19pc .",
    "these boxes are larger and have a coarser resolution than previous simulations of similar type @xcite because our cosmic ray diffusion coefficient does not allow for higher resolution .",
    "the simulation domain is periodic in the @xmath20 and @xmath21 directions .",
    "gas can leave the box in @xmath22 direction , but infall is not permitted .",
    "we use a tree - based method to incorporate self - gravity ( wnsch et al . in prep . ) and additionally impose an external gravitational potential for the stellar component of the gravitational force on the gas .",
    "we choose the parameters of the external potential to fit solar neighbourhood values , namely a surface density in stars of @xmath23pc@xmath3 and a vertical scale height of @xmath24pc .",
    "the disk has a gas surface density @xmath25pc@xmath3 .",
    "the mass is initially set up according to a gaussian distribution in @xmath22-direction with a scale height of @xmath26pc .",
    "the disk has a midplane density of @xmath27g@xmath28 and temperature of @xmath29k .",
    "it is embedded in a halo with density @xmath30g@xmath28 and temperature @xmath31k .",
    "magnetic fields are initialized in the @xmath20-direction and scale in magnitude with the square root of the gas density .",
    "the midplane field strength is @xmath32ng . for more information on the initial conditions and simulation setup",
    "see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "following the kennicutt - schmidt relation @xcite , we inject supernova explosions at a constant supernova rate surface density of @xmath26myr@xmath33kpc@xmath3 and half of this value ( see discussion in @xcite ) . using the same approach as @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "explosion events are drawn randomly from a distribution of type ia and type ii supernovae , taking spatial and temporal correlations of explosion sites in stellar clusters into account ( see @xcite ) .    with each supernova explosion",
    ", we inject a thermal energy of @xmath34erg . for a detailed description of the supernova injection subgrid model",
    "we refer to @xcite . in simulations with cosmic rays",
    ", we additionally inject 10% of @xmath35 in the form of cosmic ray energy .",
    "we also consider a control run in which we only inject cosmic ray energy , but no thermal energy during supernova explosions @xcite .",
    "table  [ tab : sims ] summarizes the key simulation properties for the runs presented in this paper .",
    "simulations sn , sncr and cr are discussed in @xcite . for the small boxes , we also present simulations that include self - gravity , and simulations with half the fiducial supernova rate .",
    "additionally , we show one high - resolution simulation from @xcite with identical supernova rate and surface density , and which uses the same clustered driving , s10-ks - clus .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      + we list the values of the gas surface density @xmath36 , the supernova rate ( surface density ) , the numerical resolution , and the box dimension .",
    "we also specify which simulations include thermal energy injection , cosmic rays or self - gravity .",
    "since x - rays are emitted from hot , ionized gas in the halo , we show in figure  [ fig : prof ] vertical profiles of the h@xmath37 number density and temperature for the upper halo of the simulations sn , sncr and cr after @xmath38 and @xmath39myr .",
    "the simulations with cosmic - ray feedback can reach half an order of magnitude higher densities of h@xmath37 in the halo .",
    "however , this h@xmath37 is at much lower temperatures , @xmath40k instead of @xmath41k in the pure thermal case . including cosmic rays , the galactic wind is mostly atomic in composition @xcite , which through mixing processes with the ionized component leads to a lower average temperature of h@xmath37 in the halo .",
    "after @xmath39myr , simulation sn has filled the halo up to 13kpc with hot gas from a galactic wind .",
    "runs sncr and cr expand more slowly ( see discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "simulation sncr only drives gas in excess of @xmath42k into the halo in a @xmath43kpc wide layer ahead of the primarily atomic outflow , while run cr does not create any hot gas at all .",
    "to estimate the importance of absorption for the soft x - ray surface brightness maps , we compute the total optical depth for the neutral hydrogen cross section along lines of sight from @xmath44kpc above the galactic midplane to the end of the simulation box at 20kpc .",
    "soft x - rays are primarily absorbed by atomic hydrogen near @xmath45 .",
    "the absorption cross section per hydrogen nucleus can be approximated by @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the energy of the x - ray photon @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath48 falls monotonically from @xmath49 to @xmath50 , with an average value of @xmath51 .",
    "we find optical depths well below @xmath52 for the vast majority of the sightlines .",
    "although the galactic wind is mostly atomic in composition in the cosmic - ray runs , the total amount of atomic hydrogen that accumulates in the halo remains small , and the entire halo stays optically thin .",
    "therefore , we can neglect absorption for the computation of the surface brightness maps .",
    "we use an emission table generated with the astrophysical plasma emission code ( apec , @xcite ) from the collisional ionization database atomdb to compute the x - ray emissivity in the energy band @xmath4@xmath5kev .",
    "the metallicity is solar throughout .",
    "the emissivity is largest for gas with temperatures between @xmath53k and @xmath54k and declines rapidly for higher and lower temperatures .",
    "given the emissivity as function of temperature and density , we compute surface brightness maps by integrating the emissivity along lines of sight . the base grid of our simulations has a resolution of @xmath55 in the midplane ( @xmath20-@xmath21 plane ) for the large boxes and @xmath56 for the small ones .",
    "for each of these @xmath57-coordinates , we trace a ray outwards until the end of the simulation volume and integrate the emissivity along the ray .",
    "we start the integration at an altitude of @xmath58kpc above the midplane to only include halo gas .",
    "hereafter , we call the region @xmath59kpc the upper halo . to visualize the structure of the galactic wind in the simulations , we also generate edge - on maps of the surface brightness with an analogous procedure .",
    "@xcite use a more complex method to post - process the galactic fountain models of @xcite , following closely the analyis of real observations .",
    "we have compared our values for the surface brightness to the results of this more sophisticated procedure by applying our method to the @xcite simulations .",
    "we find good agreement in the surface brightness distribution between the results reported by @xcite and our own values .",
    "however , our approach does not allow us to determine x - ray temperatures , and so we will focus exclusively on the surface brightness in this paper .",
    "the morphology of the face - on soft x - ray emission is qualitatively similar in all simulations .",
    "the largest differences occur as function of the outflow driving mechanism .",
    "we illustrate this in figure  [ fig : morph ] for the three simulations sn , sncr and cr at a simulation time of @xmath60myr .",
    "when thermal feedback is included , the supernova and/or cosmic - ray driving launches a wind into the galactic halo that is bright in soft x - rays . in the case of runs sn and sncr , supernova explosions inject hot gas into the halo that reaches a height of @xmath61kpc .",
    "the edge - on surface brightness corresponds very well to the vertical profiles of figure  [ fig : prof ] .    because of the lower temperature of the wind , run sncr has a smaller face - on surface brightness than run sn .",
    "most of the gas launched by the galactic wind in run sncr is too cool to emit soft x - rays .",
    "therefore , supernovae which explode at high altitudes and inject thermal energy locally into the halo provide a more important contribution to the face - on surface brightness than in run sn , where the galactic wind is bright in soft x - rays and the emission stems from the entirety of the halo gas .",
    "as expected , run cr is completely dark in soft x - rays , with the exception of the hot gas remaining from the initial conditions . in all cases",
    "the face - on maps of surface brightness are relatively homogeneous , with a scatter for different lines of sight of less than an order of magnitude .",
    "run sn is an order of magnitude brighter than run sncr , with run sn being very close to the observed values .",
    "as the simulations proceed , an increasing amount of gas is pushed into the halo .",
    "figure  [ fig : distr ] shows the face - on surface brightness distribution of run sn , sncr and cr at @xmath60myr and @xmath62myr .",
    "the width of the distribution in all snapshots is one order of magnitude or smaller . in the @xmath63myr of evolution between the snapshots , the distribution shifts towards larger surface brightnesses , but does not significantly change its shape .    the histograms for the simulations with the smaller volume are shown in figure  [ fig : distr ] for @xmath60myr .",
    "the surface brightness distributions of the simulations with the lower supernova rates are shifted towards smaller values by a factor of a few compared to simulations with the fiducial supernova rates , but only in the case of pure thermal feedback .",
    "most strikingly , the runs that include self - gravity have an up to one order of magnitude higher surface brightness than simulations without self - gravity .",
    "both sets of simulations with and without cosmic rays show this effect , but it is more pronounced in the pure thermal case .",
    "the reason for the increase in surface brightness for simulations with self - gravity is the formation of filaments and sheets in the disk , which sets in after about @xmath64myr .",
    "these structures bind the diffuse gas in the disk , so that supernovae exploding in voids can inject large amounts of hot gas into the halo . without self - gravity , these ejecta are largely absorbed by diffuse gas in the disk before they can enter the halo .",
    "all surface brightness distributions have mean values not farther away than one order of magnitude from the median of the @xcite observations .",
    "[ fig : distr ]",
    "the time evolution of the mean face - on surface brightness of all simulations is shown in figure  [ fig : time ] .",
    "run sn reaches a value of @xmath65erg @xmath1 s@xmath2 deg@xmath3 after 50myr , and then @xmath66 continues to grow slowly .",
    "we note that this growth is not limited by the size of the simulation box , which extends up to 20kpc ( compare figure  [ fig : prof ] ) .",
    "run sncr is much more intermittent than run sn because of the large relative importance of supernova explosions at high altitudes . on average , the surface brightness in run sncr",
    "is one order of magnitude smaller than in run sn .",
    "the simulations with the smaller boxes show a similar behavior as the other runs . for pure thermal feedback , runs with a lower supernova rate always have a smaller surface brightness than simulations with the fiducial value .",
    "note , however , that the difference in surface brightness at late times is much larger than the difference in the supernova rate .",
    "therefore , simulations with only thermal feedback are very sensitive to the assumed supernova rate . when cosmic rays are included , no systematic dependence on the supernova rate is observed .",
    "of all the different physical effects considered here , self - gravity has by far the largest impact .",
    "this , however , is only a temporary effect , because in our simulations the inclusion of self - gravity leads to a run - away process that accumulates most mass in dense clouds that can not be destroyed by supernovae @xcite . at @xmath60myr ,",
    "most of the disk in run sb - sn - sg has been blown away , and the remaining gas is locked up in a few blobs in the midplane .",
    "in contrast , the disks in runs sb - sncr and sb - sncr - sg can survive for a longer time . therefore , their evolution is more steady compared to the bursty situation in run sb - sn - sg .    the high - resolution run s10-ks - clus behaves similarly as the other simulations but shows larger fluctuations over time , which is expected .",
    "the magnitude of the surface brightness in the lower - resolution runs is therefore not affected by resolution .",
    "all the simulations reach surface brightness values between @xmath67erg @xmath1 s@xmath2 deg@xmath3 and @xmath68erg @xmath1 s@xmath2 deg@xmath3 .",
    "this agrees with the observations by @xcite within an order of magnitude .",
    "because the time variability of the observed values is unknown , and since our simulations do not reach a steady state within the simulation runtime , a comparison of absolute values should not be overemphasized .",
    "the exact surface brightness values depend sensitively on the simulation parameters , but all of our simulations naturally produce values of the same order of magnitude as the observations .",
    "we can estimate the energy budget of the upper halo ( @xmath59kpc ) as follows . for symmetry reasons ,",
    "we assume that half of the energy input ( thermal or cosmic rays ) from supernova explosions goes into the heating of the upper halo .",
    "furthermore , we have to consider the total x - ray heating rate of the upper halo due to the @xcite prescription , which is the only heating term in our chemical network that affects hot , ionized gas .",
    "both forms of energy input give the total heating rate @xmath69 . in simulations with the fiducial supernova rate and thermal feedback ,",
    "the energy input from supernova explosions is about @xmath70 times the x - ray heating rate , however in run cr both forms of energy input are comparable in magnitude . therefore , the contribution of x - ray heating to the surface brightness is negligible when thermal feedback is present .",
    "the energy radiated away by soft x - rays is given by the luminosity @xmath71 .",
    "figure  [ fig : time ] shows @xmath71 and the ratio @xmath72 as function of time .",
    "the amount of energy radiated away in soft x - rays is usually less than a percent and in most cases even less than a permille .",
    "we have presented a differential analysis of the soft x - ray emission from the galactic halo in a set of simulations in which we systematically vary the effects of supernova feedback , cosmic - ray driving and self - gravity .",
    "we find that star formation feedback alone is sufficient to explain the observed surface brightness . for pure thermal feedback ,",
    "the results are very sensitive to the supernova rate .",
    "cosmic rays suppress this dependence and reduce the surface brightness by an order of magnitude or more .",
    "self - gravity binds the diffuse gas in the disk plane , so that supernovae exploding in voids can blow a large amount of hot gas into the halo .",
    "this can boost the soft x - ray surface brightness by several orders of magnitude . because this quantity is extremely sensitive to the above physical effects ,",
    "we conclude that observations of the soft x - ray surface brightness alone do not provide useful diagnostics for the study of galactic star formation .",
