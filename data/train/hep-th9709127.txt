    "the planck mass , @xmath0 and corresponding length @xmath1 or time @xmath2 , are of fundamental importance , marking the onset of strong non - renormalizable quantum gravity effects . in this `` superplanckian '' regime",
    "the theoretical framework of local field theory and indeed the very concept of space time may break down .",
    "many different lines of reasoning suggest that @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the minimal distance to which the location of an elementary particle can be defined and the maximal energy to which an elementary localized degree of freedom can be excited .    in the following",
    "we address the question of the highest energy that can be given to a single elementary particle in our universe subject to the known laws of microphysics and cosmology .",
    "as one approaches the planck regime novel physics effects may come into play , modifying the very concept of an elementary degree of freedom .",
    "this new , fundamental , planck scale physics may , in turn , directly prevent crossing the `` planck barrier '' , i.e. prevents achieving @xmath5 for one elementary degree of freedom .",
    "however we are starting with the familiar low energy regime where weakly coupled theories , with degrees of freedom corresponding to local fields or pointlike quarks , leptons , photons , and other gauge bosons apply .",
    "our question whether any device utilizing electromagnetism , gravity , or strong interaction ( qcd ) can accelerate such an elementary particle to an energy @xmath6 is therefore well posed .",
    "interestingly we find that an interplay of microphysics and cosmological parameters may prevent acceleration to @xmath7 .",
    "strictly speaking accelerating one particle to @xmath8 causes only one , longitudinal , ( @xmath9 ) dimension to shrink up to @xmath10 .",
    "it does not , by itself , generate say energy densities in the superplanckian regime : @xmath11 . to achieve",
    "the latter in say a @xmath12 collision scattering is generated via @xmath13 collisions .",
    "the momentum fraction carried by the valence quarks evolves to zero as @xmath14 but only logarithmically .",
    "thus we can still achieve in principle the superplanckian @xmath12 collisions if the protons are accelerated to somewhat higher energies @xmath15 .",
    "] we need to accelerate the two quarks in opposite directions so as to have an invariant center of mass energy @xmath16 and then both have to mutually scatter with a transverse momentum transfer @xmath17 so as to achieve localization also in the transverse ( x , y ) directions down to @xmath18 .",
    "the cross section for such a collision , @xmath19 , is extremely small @xmath20 making the goal of achieving superplanckian energy densities far more difficult than the mere acceleration of one particle to @xmath21 .",
    "can be built , there is no intrinsic difficulty in joining two such accelerators back to back to achieve cms invariant planck energy . ]",
    "we find however that even the latter goal seems to be unattainable .",
    "it should be emphasized that this does not stem from any limitation of say a maximal lorentz boost . thus boosts vastly exceeding @xmath22 ( or @xmath23 )",
    "required to achieve planck energy proton ( or electron ) are implicit in having very energetic photons .",
    "the latter can be viewed as very soft photons boosted by @xmath24 .",
    "the group property of lorentz boosts implies that one very large boost can be achieved in many successive small steps .",
    "thus consider the set of `` gedanken '' nested accelerators illustrated schematically in fig .",
    "suppose that a proton is accelerated inside some microscopic device @xmath25(see fig .",
    "( 1 ) ) to @xmath26 .",
    "the whole @xmath25 device in turn sits within a larger setup @xmath27 , which boosts @xmath25 to @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath27 in turn sits inside @xmath28 ... etc . ,",
    "the device @xmath29 is then also boosted by @xmath30 to @xmath26 , thus finally achieving transplanckian energies @xmath31 for our proton .",
    "it is hard to imagine a non - local mechanism impeding the operation of the huge accelerator @xmath30 just because nineteen layers down , inside the innermost microscopic @xmath32 proton is about to achieve planck energy .",
    "however strict lorentz invariance applies only if space time is uniform and flat . precisely due to gravity @xmath33",
    "the universe is curved , and the horizon grows ( since the big bang ) only with a finite velocity @xmath34 .    the idealized nested accelerator and many others which we discuss below are either larger than the present universe , are too fragile and breaks down , or are too compact and massive and collapses into a black hole .",
    "more sophisticated multi - stage devices are flawed by the amplification of tiny errors in the process of acceleration or require overly complex corrective feedback .",
    "clearly the issue here is not of overall energetics .",
    "just one ton of matter moving at a modest velocity of @xmath35 has kinetic energy @xmath36 .",
    "this is also the output in one second of a high intensity laser .",
    "the real `` bottleneck '' is the focusing of all of this energy residing initially in @xmath37 nucleons or photons onto a single proton !",
    "we proceed next to discussion of various type of `` gedanken accelerators '' .",
    "electromagnetism presents an easily controlled long range force and hence it is most natural to consider its utilization for accelerators first .",
    "electromagnetism , along with quantum mechanics and the mass of the electron , also fix the scale of atomic ( chemical ) energies and material strength .",
    "terrestrial em accelerators operating at limited@xmath38 scales already produce @xmath39 .",
    "similar devices of cosmic dimensions could naively be envisioned with far larger acceleration energies .",
    "indeed even naturally occurring cosmic ray acceleration generates primaries ( protons ! ) with @xmath40 which have already been experimentally observed .    the claim that protons or electrons with energies @xmath41 can never be achieved is therefore far from obvious .",
    "hopefully it will become clearer as we proceed through a list of more and more sophisticated accelerators .",
    "an obvious objection to the notion of maximal energy is its non - lorentz invariant nature .",
    "thus if we put our `` laboratory '' or the accelerator on a rocket and boost it by a factor @xmath42 the energy that we see in our lab will be enhanced by an extra factor of @xmath42    let us assume that the rocket is boosted via emitting `` burnt fuel '' at a velocity @xmath43 relative to the rocket . if the latter ever becomes relativistic then momentum conservation yields ( henceforth @xmath44 ) @xmath45 with @xmath46 the red shifted momentum of the emitted mass element balanced by the increment @xmath47 of the rocket momentum .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) readily yields @xmath48    normal exhaust velocities are very small making @xmath49 hopelessly small .",
    "even if @xmath50 , i.e. the rest mass is converted into photons , just to achieve @xmath51 for a 100  kg `` laboratory '' requires @xmath52 ! thus no appreciable boost can be achieved and this naive realization of the `` nested accelerators '' scheme is impossible .",
    "instead of accelerating macroscopic pieces of matter , one may accelerate single charged particles via photon pressure .",
    "an intense laser beam can accelerate charged particle to high energies by repeated compton scattering .",
    "as the particle approaches the putative super - planckian regime , it becomes extremely relativistic . in the particle s rest frame the photons will be strongly red - shifted ( by a @xmath53 factor ) and @xmath54 is appropriate .",
    "if the energy flux @xmath55 of the photon beam is :    @xmath56    the key factor limiting the rate of energy gain is the difference between the photon and particle velocities @xmath57 .    integrating we find that after time @xmath58 , @xmath59 the flux of energy in the beam is related to the mean @xmath60 by @xmath61    we will demand that @xmath62 so as to avoid vacuum breakdown via @xmath63 pair creation@xcite .",
    "hence @xmath64 and @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the length of the accelerator .",
    "evidently the growth of energy with linear dimension @xmath67 is too slow . even if @xmath68 , @xmath69 .",
    "if the lightest charged particle were not the electron , but rather some heavier particle x , @xmath70 would be larger by a factor of @xmath71 .",
    "planck energies would still be unattainable so long as @xmath72 does not exceed @xmath73 !",
    "the energy loss due to synchrotron radiation for a circular accelerator is given by @xcite @xmath74    the mild requirement that @xmath75 should not exceed @xmath76 ( namely that all the energy is not radiated away in one turn ) , implies @xmath77 or @xmath78 .",
    "( [ eq2])is fortuitously similar to eq . ( [ eq3 ] ) above with @xmath79 replaced by @xmath80 , the mass of the accelerating particle . even for @xmath81 and @xmath82 of mass @xmath83 the limit of eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) would appear to allow planckian acceleration . ]",
    "@xmath84    another important corollary which follows from the large rate of synchrotron loss ( eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) above ) is : acceleration to an energy w along a circular arc of length l and an angle @xmath85 is impossible unless @xmath86 this relation will be useful in subsequent considerations .",
    "the simplest , `` brute - force '' , accelerator consists of a finite region of space of dimension r in all directions in which an electric field e exists .",
    "the final energies obtained are limited by : @xmath87    the `` 3-d '' field in question could be due to two `` capacitor '' plates of size r x r placed at a distance r apart . in principle",
    "it appears that @xmath88 can be obtained even for small e if r is sufficiently large .",
    "a more `` realistic '' setup could be an extreme rotating neutron star such that the intense b field generates an almost equal e field @xmath89 we will not address the important issues of how one builds cosmic capacitors or the effects of synchrotron radiation due to magnetic bending of particle trajectories in the magnetic field around the neutron star - which drastically reduces the maximal energies obtained .",
    "the interesting point is that no such three dimensional configuration can , in principle , achieve planck energies .",
    "the total energy stored in the b and e fields , @xmath90   \\approx ( b^2 + e^2)r^3 $ ] , should not exceed the critical value @xmath91 , or the whole system will collapse into a black hole of schwarzchild radius r. however , @xmath92 implies @xmath93 ( or @xmath94 ) and since @xmath95 , we find that @xmath96(or @xmath97 , this result is independent of how compact and strong or extended and weak the field configuration may be .",
    "the only key requirement is that the electromagnetic charge of the elementary particle accelerated be smaller than unity .",
    ", should be considered as elementary .",
    "then the thooft - polyakov monopoles are extended objects of size @xmath98 and effectively contain @xmath99 elementary quanta . ]",
    "the excessive masses and synchrotron radiation can apparently be avoided in the case of linear accelerators .",
    "existing linacs have gains @xmath100 and extend over lengths @xmath101 few kilometers .",
    "electron energies @xmath102 and @xmath103 can thus be achieved . scaling up @xmath104 and/or @xmath105 one",
    "might hope to achieve @xmath106 .",
    "let us first note that the gain , @xmath105 , is limited by @xmath107    @xmath108 is the maximal electric field that can be generated or sustained by charges or currents in normal matter .",
    "stronger fields would readily ionize hydrogen atoms .",
    "such fields overcome the work function and skim all conduction ( valence ) electrons breaking all materials . in general any physical system that stores or guides energy with density @xmath109 experiences a pressure @xmath110 with a coefficient of order unity .",
    "the maximal e corresponds then to the maximal pressure @xmath111 that materials can withstand .    even for @xmath112",
    "the minimal , `` net '' , acceleration length required for achieving energy @xmath113 is : @xmath114 further , to avoid local buckling under the pressure inside the pipe the thickness of the pipe , should be comparable with the radius @xmath115 .",
    "let us consider next the electromagnetic field of the accelerating particle itself .",
    "the rest frame coulomb field @xmath116 has a coulomb energy @xmath117 stored in the pipe wall . in the lab frame this becomes an electromagnetic pulse of duration shortened by lorentz contraction down to @xmath118 and total energy @xmath119 according to the w.w .",
    "method@xcite this pulse is equivalent to a pulse of real photons of energy ( @xmath120 ) @xmath121 the high energy equivalent photons will produce @xmath63 pairs on the wall nuclei with the bethe - heitler cross section @xmath122 this leads to an energy loss at a rate : @xmath123 it is convenient to parameterize the density of scattering nuclei via ( @xmath120 ) @xmath124 with the dimensionless @xmath125 being typically @xmath126 .",
    "demanding that the loss rate does not exceed the    maximal gain @xmath127 thus , for @xmath128 , we find that unless @xmath129 we will not be able to achieve @xmath130 for protons .",
    "this implies in particular that @xmath131 the large length ( @xmath132 ) and diameter ( @xmath133)required exacerbate another crucial difficulty ; namely , that of guiding the accelerating particle to remain at all times along the central axis , and maintaining this linear trajectory with very high precision .",
    "such guidance is required for several reasons .",
    "the light - like particle suffers a gravitational deflection of order @xmath134 as it travels a distance @xmath104 in the field @xmath135 of a galaxy of schwarzchild radius @xmath136 at a distance @xmath137 away . using @xmath138 and @xmath139 as `` typical '' values and @xmath140 we find by comparing with eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) that the radiative synchrotron losses , due to the gravitational bending will be excessive once @xmath141 , one order of magnitude smaller than @xmath142 .",
    "more generally , let us envision some transverse `` wobbling '' of the accelerated particle around the axis with wavelength @xmath143 and amplitude @xmath144 . using eq .",
    "( [ eq44 ] ) ( with @xmath145 ) we find that in order to avoid excessive synchrotron losses we must satisfy @xmath146 even if we take @xmath147 , an incredible accuracy of trajectory with @xmath148 should be maintained at all times .",
    "this would seem to be virtually impossible if we indeed maintain an empty pipe hole and guide the particle only via fields generated at the pipe wall at a distance of @xmath149 away .",
    "a key observation in this context is that on - line monitoring and correction of the orbit is impossible .",
    "thus let us assume that at some `` station '' @xmath150 we find the position and velocity of the accelerating particle and then transmit the information to the next `` station '' @xmath151 `` downstream '' so that some corrective action can be taken there . if the distance between the two stations is @xmath152 then a signal traveling with the velocity of light will arrive only a very short time @xmath153 ahead of our particle .",
    "the distance that a corrective device can move at that time is only @xmath154 where @xmath155 is the velocity with which the corrective device moves .    using @xmath22 we find ( even for @xmath156 ! ) that @xmath157 so that even for @xmath158 !    our considerations of the linear accelerator touched only some of the possible difficulties .",
    "yet these arguments strongly suggest that such a project is not merely difficult because of , say , the need to assemble a @xmath159 pipe of 20,000 solar masses .",
    "rather there are inherent , `` in principle '' , difficulties which make the project of accelerating particles to planck energy via a linear accelerator impossible .",
    "gravity is , in many ways , the strongest rather than the weakest interaction .",
    "this is amply manifest in the gravitational collapse to a black hole which no other interaction can stop .",
    "along with the very definition of the planck mass , @xmath160 , this naturally leads us to consider gravitational accelerators , and the acceleration ( or other effects ) of black holes in particular .",
    "if a particle of mass @xmath161 falls from infinity to a distance r from the center of a spherical object of mass m , it obtains , in the relativistic case as well , a final velocity @xmath162 with @xmath163 , the schwarzchild radius of the mass m. in order that our particle obtain , in a `` single shot '' , planckian energies , we need that @xmath164 or @xmath165 the last equation applies also if at infinity we have initially a photon or massless neutrino of energy@xmath161 . using for the generic starting energy or rest mass @xmath166",
    "we then find @xmath167 since to avoid trapping the last ratio should exceed 2 this planck acceleration is clearly ruled out .",
    "the difficulty of using the gravitational fields in the neighborhood of the black hole horizon is best illustrated by considering the following concept of a `` hanging laboratory '' ( suggested to us by n. itzhaki as a possible counterexample to the impossibility of achieving planck energy ) .",
    "thus let us envision a black hole of very large radius @xmath136 .",
    "we can then hang our laboratory keeping it at a distance d away from the horizon",
    ". if @xmath137 is sufficiently large there will be minimal tidal distortion across the laboratory .",
    "an energetic particle falling towards our laboratory would then be blue - shifted by a factor @xmath168 and can appear superplanckian to us , once @xmath169 is large enough .    amusingly , this fails simply because any `` rope '' used to hang the laboratory and extending between @xmath170 and @xmath171 with @xmath172 tears under its own weight .",
    "imagine that the rope is `` virtually displaced '' downwards around the upper hanging area by some distance @xmath173 which we take to be @xmath174 , the inter - atomic distance in the rope material .",
    "this will decrease the gravitational energy by @xmath175 with @xmath176 the mass of a rope element of length @xmath173 : @xmath177 where s is the cross - sectional area of the rope and @xmath178 the mass density with @xmath179 the average mass of the nuclei in the rope material .",
    "a displacement by @xmath180 causes the tearing of the rope .",
    "the energy required for tearing the rope is @xmath181 with @xmath182 the number of atomic nearest - neighbor bonds torn along the z direction and @xmath183 is our usual estimate for the bond energy .",
    "tearing will be avoided if the gravitational energy gained ( which from eq .",
    "( [ eqad ] ) is @xmath184 ) can not supply the @xmath181 energy required i.e. if : @xmath185 which leads to the condition ( note that as @xmath186 cancels ) : @xmath187 this inequality clearly fails .",
    "we can also show that tearing can not be avoided by having the cross section of the rope change so that a broader section on top can more readily sustain the weight of a lighter section on the bottom .",
    "a sophisticated accelerator using repeated `` slingshot kicks '' was suggested by unruh .",
    "this beautiful concept is best illustrated in the following simple two black holes context .",
    "consider first two black holes of equal mass @xmath188 at points @xmath189 and @xmath190 located at @xmath191 along the @xmath9 axis . a relativistic neutral particle @xmath161 ( neutron , neutrino , or photon )",
    "is injected parallel to the z - axis with some relative impact parameter near @xmath192 . with an appropriate choice of the impact parameter @xmath193",
    ", the accelerated particle describes a `` semi - circle '' trajectory around @xmath194 at @xmath195 , and is reflected around this mass by an angle @xmath196 exactly . moving then along a reflected ( @xmath197 ) trajectory the particle @xmath161 approaches the other mass @xmath198 at @xmath190 , and",
    "is reflected there by @xmath196 as well .",
    "the particle will eventually describe a closed geodesic trajectory bound to the two mass @xmath199 system .",
    "in reality these two masses move . for simplicity",
    "consider the case when the masses move symmetrically towards each other with relative velocity @xmath43 .",
    "transforming from the rest mass of @xmath198 say to the `` lab frame '' , we find that in each reflection the energy of @xmath161 is enhanced according to @xmath200 .",
    "the last equation represents the boost due to the `` slingshot kick '' alluded to above .",
    "if we have @xmath201 such reflections , the total boost factor is @xmath202 . in order to achieve planck energies , for starting energies",
    "@xmath203 , this overall boost should exceed @xmath204 .",
    "however , in this simple geometry the total number of reflections is limited by @xmath205 .",
    "after more reflections , the two masses will either coalesce or reverse their velocities , leading now to a deceleration of the particle @xmath161 upon each reflection .",
    "furthermore , in order to avoid the two masses coalescing into a black hole upon first passage , we find that @xmath206 , the maximal @xmath43 along the trajectory , is @xmath207 .",
    "the total amplification is therefore bound by @xmath208 .",
    "the unruh set up involves , however , two additional heavier black holes @xmath209with @xmath210 , revolving around @xmath211 respectively , in circular orbits of equal radius @xmath137 and period @xmath212 , with @xmath213 the orbital velocity .",
    "the two orbits are assumed to lie in the @xmath214 plane with the centers of the circles located at @xmath215 .",
    "the `` top points '' on the two circles , _",
    "i.e. _ the points where x is maximal , define now the original reflection centers @xmath216 .",
    "the oppositely rotating masses @xmath194 and @xmath217 are synchronized to pass at @xmath195 and @xmath190 , respectively , at the same time  once during each period t. furthermore , the motion of the accelerated mass @xmath161 is timed so as to have @xmath161 at the extreme left point on its `` stadium shaped '' orbit @xmath218 or , at the extreme right point @xmath219 , at precisely the above times .",
    "this then allows us to achieve the desired sling shot boosts , repeating once every period t. note that 2 t is now the period of the motion of the overall five body system @xmath220 .",
    "however , the inherent instability of this motion limits the number @xmath201 of periods ( and of sling shot boosts ) and foils this ingenious device .",
    "the assumed hierarchical set - up @xmath221 can be used to approximate the angular deflection of @xmath161 while it is circulating around @xmath222 , say , by @xmath223 with @xmath224 the impact parameter and @xmath225 corresponding to the turning point of closest approach . independently of the exact ( inverse elliptic function ) dependence of @xmath226 on @xmath227 ,",
    "a fluctuation @xmath228 around the optimal @xmath229 , for which @xmath230 equals @xmath231 , causes a corresponding fluctuation in the reflection angle @xmath230 : @xmath232 , with the dimensionless constant @xmath233 of order one .",
    "the large distance @xmath104 transforms this small @xmath234 into a new impact parameter deviation , @xmath235 .",
    "the ratio between successive deviations of the impact parameter is then given by @xmath236 , etc .",

    "( this beautiful refutation of the unruh accelerator is due to b. reznik . )",
    "the above unruh accelerator is actually a prototype of many other gravitational accelerators in which the high energy is achieved by repeating many stages of more limited boosts .",
    "another example , suggested to us by a. polyakov , involves the phenomenon of super - radiance@xcite .",
    "specifically if two particles fall towards a rotating black hole , and collide in its vicinity then one can be emitted with an energy higher than the total energy .",
    "it turns out again that the ratio of @xmath257 with @xmath258 so that many repeated such collisions with a series of kerr black holes is required and again exponentially growing fluctuations are encountered .    thus , ab - initio , finely tuned , perfect , gravitational accelerators are impossible .",
    "could we still achieve such energies if we monitor the trajectory and correct deviations ?",
    "since the accelerated particle is neutral ( to avoid synchrotron losses ) , the correction of the trajectory requires additional mass(es ) . just adding such masses only complicates the problem turning the unruh accelerator into say , a six ( or more ) body problem .",
    "hence we need two ingredients : ( i ) extra non - gravitational forces to navigate the corrective masses and ( ii ) means for monitoring the trajectory of the accelerated particle .",
    "neither of these tasks seems readily achievable .",
    "thus to have an appreciable light bending effect the corrective mass should be large - probably a black hole itself and its propulsion via non - gravitational forces ( say some rocket mechanism ) appears impossible    the second task of monitoring the location and momentum @xmath259 of the accelerated particle @xmath161 is even more difficult . to this end",
    "we need to scatter other particles from @xmath161 .",
    "since , among others , we need to correct for the effect of @xmath260 we have to monitor each accelerated particle individually , by having several scatterings from @xmath161 during one traversal of its closed orbit .",

    "finally , gravitational boosting of the mini black holes is excluded by the reasoning presented in sections ( [ da]),([tua ] ) . in particular since the minimal distance to which the mini black hole can approach the big black hole without being captured onto it , is limited by @xmath281 , the schwarzchild radius of the large black hole , we can not achieve even @xmath282 boosts .",
    "another serious difficulty with using evaporating mini black holes as planck accelerators - albeit for o(1 ) quanta emitted at the last stage - stems from the fact that such black holes can not be created ab - initio in the lab .",
    "the bottleneck is again the need to focus excessive energy onto a tiny domain of size @xmath136 - the schwarzchild radius of the prospective black hole .    to see that , consider the following `` attempt '' to build small black holes by focusing energy .",

    "there is the `` standard '' mechanism of generating black holes via the collapse of supermassive ( @xmath300 ) stellar cores with @xmath301 , the chandrasekhar mass .",
    "the evaporation time of such a black hole is : @xmath302 it has been speculated by lee smolin [ @xcite ] that the final decays of these black holes will spawn new universes .",
    "most of the limitations and bounds on accelerators that were found above stem from the fact that our starting particles have some limited energy , etc . to denote the energy of individual particles and @xmath303 the energy of the complete system with @xmath201 particles]@xmath304 and that normal materials have limited energy density and strength @xmath305 .",
    "we may try to generate an `` inverted cascade '' process where fewer and fewer particles will survive at consecutive stages but with increasing energy . @xmath306 since the starting energy in each stage is higher , the original energy - strength bounds do not apply .",
    "this is a crucial difference between this gedanken accelerator and the , superficially similar , rocket accelerator .",
    "there even later stages are constructed from ordinary fragile material .",
    "indeed we do not envision here a static accelerator , but rather a sequence of transient or `` single - shot '' devices .",
    "it is modeled in an abstract way after the schematic `` nested accelerator '' of fig .",
    "( 1 ) . we are , however , building consecutively the various stages of the accelerator starting from the biggest outermost stage first as the very acceleration process proceeds . in this `` dynamical accelerator '' earlier stages which have fulfilled their mission",
    "literally `` evaporate '' and disappear .",
    "let us assume that the process starts at the zeroth stage with @xmath307 particles , each with kinetic energy @xmath308 , so that the total initial energy is @xmath309 in the kth stage we have @xmath310 particles of average energy @xmath311 , and the total energy at this stage is @xmath312 if no `` waste heat energy '' is dissipated in going from one stage to the next then @xmath313 and after @xmath314 stages all the energy would concentrate in one single particle of energy @xmath315 however such a process - where all the many , low energy final , particles conspire to reconstitute the energetic primary proton is completely impossible . specifically , we need to worry about the second law of thermodynamics as well .    thus along with a fraction @xmath316 of the particles of the kth generation which have been elevated to higher energies @xmath317 and constitute the ( k+1)th stage of the accelerator , we need to emit a certain minimal amount of energy as `` waste heat '' in the form of particles of energy lower than @xmath318 .",
    "what is the maximal efficiency of the kth stage accelerator , i.e. what is the maximal value of the ratio @xmath319 let us identify the average energy of a particle in the kth stage with a fictitious `` effective temperature '' @xmath320 for this stage .",
    "@xmath321 let us follow the pattern of our schematic idealized nested accelerator of fig .",
    "thus we identify the kth accelerating stage as a device which transfers a fraction @xmath322 of its energy to the next , @xmath323 stage and at the same time dissipates the rest .",
    "the maximal thermodynamic efficiency of such a device is limited by : @xmath324 or @xmath325 hence the equation is bound by @xmath326 where @xmath327 indicates a second derivative with respect to @xmath328 and we assumed that we have many stages with @xmath329    in eq .",

    ", attractive force seems to be required in order to keep these particles confined .",
    "gravity can precisely supply that .",
    "indeed the evaporating black hole of section 9 can be viewed as an `` inverted cascade '' planck accelerator . to this end",
    "we should view its initial stage with mass @xmath337 and corresponding temperature @xmath338 as a collection of @xmath339 hawking photons each with average energy @xmath340 so that all together we have @xmath341 in the process of hawking radiation some of these `` photons '' are radiated away - the total energy decreases , but the remaining , fewer , photons get `` hotter '' i.e. more energetic according to : @xmath342 until ultimately we stay with @xmath343 planck photons @xmath344 , and eq .",
    "( [ eq66 ] ) precisely conforms to the above @xmath345 with @xmath346.the optimality of the black hole in `` upgrading '' energy up to a planckian level may be related to another interesting issue of maximal number of elementary `` computations '' in a given spacetime region .",
    "( s. massar and s. popescu , work in preparation . ) ]",
    "the accelerators considered so far - with the exception of the evaporating black hole - fall into two basic categories : accelerators where a large number of quanta of some common low energy @xmath347 are absorbed by the accelerating particle , and those involving predesigned , classical field configurations .",
    "the latter include neutron stars , the gedanken capacitor fields and also the linear accelerator .",
    "much energy is stored in advance in coherent collective classical degrees of freedom .",
    "these degrees of freedom then directly interact with and accelerate the particle .",
    "the photon beam accelerator of section [ seca ] is typical of the first category .",
    "for all accelerators in the first category there is a clear - cut limit on the rate of energy increase .",
    "it follows from the confluence of the limited energy density or energy flux @xmath348 and the @xmath349 relative velocity factor . if @xmath308 is some effective low energy physics mass scale ( = energy of photons , atomic energies , nuclear energies , nucleons mass , ... ) then this implies @xmath350 and @xmath351 the time required to achieve @xmath352 is therefore @xmath353 the issue of acceleration via coherent preexisting fields is less clear . the energy density in the accelerating field is still limited by @xmath354 with @xmath308 some low energy physics scale .",
    "in addition to this we also need to address the questions of how the classical field is to be generated in the first place and also of the stability of the trajectory of the accelerating particle .",
    "we would like to speculate that given all these limitations the general bound eq .",
    "( [ eqb ] ) still applies .",
    "it is amusing to apply this speculation to super - high cosmic rays .",
    "recently such primary cosmic rays , with energies exceeding @xmath355gev have been observed@xcite@xcite .",
    "these findings appear to conflict with the greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin bound on originating primary protons ( because of the energy degradation by the @xmath356 background radiation ) .",
    "however eq . ( [ eq66 ] ) ( with a `` natural '' choice @xmath357 ) would allow , in hubble time , @xmath358 values up to @xmath359 still exceeding the maximal value observed by @xmath360 .",
    "needless to say the maximal cosmic ray energy observed to - date need not be the true absolute end of the cosmic ray spectrum .",
    "this raises an interesting issue .",
    "what if protons ( or neutrons ) of energy @xmath361 gev are ever found and our speculated upper upper bound value ( eq .",
    "( [ eq66 ] ) ) indeed applies ?",
    "we would then be forced to the radical conclusion that these protons / neutrons must originate from the decays of long lived particles x of mass @xmath362gev .",
    "certain planck accelerators have been ruled out by the fact that the hubble radius of the universe is too small to accommodate them .",
    "present observations and estimates of @xmath363 tend to favor an open , or critical , universe which keeps expanding forever .",
    "it would seem therefore that after waiting a sufficiently long time ( @xmath364 according to the scaling law of eq .",
    "( [ eqb ] ) with @xmath365 acceleration to super - planckian energies becomes feasible .",
    "we observe , however , that truly cosmic accelerators are `` red - shifted '' , in the process of the expansion .",

    "( [ eqb ] ) we note that even drastic reduction of the red - shifting of @xmath366 to @xmath381 with @xmath382 still will allow only a @xmath383 increase of @xmath384 .",
    "our statement that the horizon is too small really means that the dimensionless dirac number : @xmath385 is in some sense `` small '' .",
    "in particular it does not much exceed or is smaller than other dimensionless combinations that naturally arose in our previous discussions such as @xmath386 , the minimal number of particles in an ideal inverted cascade accelerator or @xmath387 which arises in the discussion of section 12 . if @xmath4 is left fixed , which we assume to be the case , we can enhance the dirac combination relative to @xmath388 by enlarging @xmath304 .",
    "this leads to the amusing question of whether planck accelerators would be feasible in a hypothetical case where the proton / electron masses are increased say by a common factor @xmath143 .",
    "scales are scaled up by a common @xmath143 .",
    "this can be done leaving gauge couplings almost the same up to mild `` running '' ( i.e. renormalization group ) logarithmic changes . ]",
    "indeed as noted above ( sections ( [ seca ] ) and ( [ ca ] ) this would reduce synchrotron radiation and enhance the rigidity of materials and of the vacuum against @xmath63 pair production breakdown in strong electric fields .",
    "hence taking @xmath389 appears to help facilitate super - planckian accelerators .",
    "clearly the cosmology of such a gedanken universe is likely to drastically change - the enhanced gravitational interactions may lead to quick recollapse drastically decreasing by as much as a factor @xmath390 or even @xmath391 the maximal @xmath392 ( or @xmath393 ) .",
    "it turns out however that physics on much shorter scales is also drastically modified , preventing dramatic increase in the maximal energy achieved by accelerators .",

    "( [ eqaa ] ) above we find that the new materials will be able to withstand much larger maximal pressure    @xmath396    and for this reason so will be the gain in say the linear accelerator    @xmath397    thus an original linac capable of achieving maximum energy @xmath398 , can now achieve @xmath399 even if @xmath400 is scaled down ( with all other dimension ) by @xmath390 .    in general",
    "the pressures in materials due to self gravity are negligible unless the dimensions are large .",
    "if we have a uniform body of size @xmath137 ( in all directions ) then the gravitational pressure is    @xmath401    if we use @xmath402 for ordinary materials and @xmath403 then : @xmath404 it exceeds @xmath405 when @xmath406 and hence hypothetical large cold stars of such dimensions would liquify at the center . for a given @xmath137 @xmath407 scales with @xmath408 whereas the maximal pressure eq .",
    "( [ eqab ] ) only with @xmath409 .",
    "hence the maximal size of new material is @xmath410 .",
    "thus taking @xmath411 ( so as to allow bridging the gap between our conjectured maximal energy @xmath412 ( in em accelerators ) @xmath413 and @xmath4 ) will make even @xmath414 devices crush - leaving little room for planckian accelerators .",
    "the above discussion strongly suggests that elementary particles with super - planckian energies may be unachievable .",
    "is this indicative of new physics or just a curiosity ? there is the well known example of our inability to build a heisenberg microscope so as to beat the uncertainty principle .",
    "however , unlike in the celebrated case , we do not ( yet ! ) see a single common principle causing all our gedanken accelerators to fail .",
    "it has been conjectured that planck scale physics can manifest in the low energy regime by inducing effective interactions which violate all global symmetries .",
    "an example is a @xmath415 term where the @xmath368 bosons carry two units of lepton number .",
    "such a term violates @xmath416 .",
    "it endows the putative massless goldstone boson ( majoron ) , associated with a spontaneous breakdown of this global @xmath417 , with a finite mass .",
    "a concrete mechanism for b - l violation involves the formation of a black hole in a collision of , say , @xmath418 , followed by the decay of the b.h . into @xmath419 , a final state with two units of lepton number . in this way",
    "the violation of the global quantum numbers traces back to the fundamental `` no hair theorem '' for black holes .",
    "exactly as in the case of su(5 ) , where a virtual @xmath420 guts meson can mediate nucleon decay by generating effective four fermi terms , the virtual `` mini black hole '' system was conjectured to induce the @xmath421 term .",
    "the estimated resulting majoron mass @xmath422 is rather high.@xcite also planckian black holes would constitute some irreducible environment and may require modification of quantum mechanics    however our inability to achieve super - planckian energies could be due to some profound principle . in the `` ultimate '' theory",
    "the whole super - planckian regime may then be altogether excluded - much in the same way that in quantum mechanics the simultaneous definition of @xmath423 and @xmath424 to better than @xmath425 is impossible .",
    "all these global quantum number or quantum mechanics violating effects will then not be there - and super planck physics even in terms of its indirect low energy manifestations could be completely absent .",
    "building a theory of this kind is an outstanding challenge that clearly will not be attempted here .",
