    "sandpile models were introduced by bak , tang and wiesenfeld@xcite as a prototypical example for a class of models that show self - organized criticality .",
    "these models show critical behavior without fine tuning of any external parameter .",
    "the abelian structure of the sandpile model was first discovered by d. dhar , and there after the ( generalized ) model was named abelian sandpile model ( asm)@xcite . despite its simplicity , asm has various interesting features and numerous work , analytical and computational , has been done on this model . among them",
    "one can mention different height and cluster probabilities@xcite , the connection of the model to spanning trees@xcite , ghost models@xcite , q - state potts model@xcite avalanche distribution@xcite . for a good review see @xcite .",
    "moreover , some of these results are analyzed in the light of a conformal field theory description with central charge @xmath4@xcite .",
    "knowing that the model has a conformal field theory description , one may be encouraged to look for geometrical objects that show conformal symmetry . the model has been shown to be related to loop erased random walk ( lerw)@xcite . on the other hand it was realized that lerw belongs to a family of conformally invariant curves called schramm - loewner evolution , sle@xmath5@xcite .",
    "schramm - loewner evolution is a mathematical description of continuum limit of interfaces in 2-dimensional critical statistical mechanical systems .",
    "the curves described by the sle growth process have two essential properties that make them suitable to describe the curves in critical statistical models : conformal invariance and the domain markov property@xcite .",
    "it is also shown that sle@xmath6 is related to conformal field theory with central charge @xmath7@xcite .",
    "this suggests that asm , which has correspondence with a @xmath1 conformal field theory , should have geometrical objects which are described by sle@xmath6 with @xmath8 or 8 .",
    "it was numerically shown that the avalanche frontiers in asm obey the statistics of sle@xmath9@xcite .",
    "many aspects of the asm have been studied at criticality , but little work is done on the model out of criticality . away from the critical point , the conformal invariance of the system breaks and therefore the drift in sle is expected not to be a simple wiener process .",
    "it is very interesting to see how the drift term properties separates from a wiener process as we slightly take the system away from the critical point .",
    "as the conformal invariance is broken , a length scale , which is a correlation length , should appear in the system .    in scales",
    "much smaller than the correlation length , but larger than the lattice constant , one expects that the statistical features of the curves fit to the critical case .",
    "since the correlation length could be assumed to diverge at these scales , the conformal symmetry is restored and the evolution of sle uniformizing map is the same as in the critical case .",
    "therefore we expect to see a wiener process at small scales with diffusivity parameter @xmath8 . on the other hand at",
    "scales much larger than the correlation length , the renormalization group ( rg ) flow may take the system to a new fixed point and we might again see a wiener process at very large scales but with a new diffusivity@xcite .",
    "we suggest that the new critical point corresponds to the self avoiding walk ( saw ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ asm ] we briefly introduce asm and off - critical asm , section [ ocsle ] contains some features of ( off - critical ) sle and in section [ nsle ] we present some statistical analysis s on waves and avalanches of asm in the off - critical state and bring our numerical result of application of schramm - loewner evolution on these off - critical avalanches .",
    "let us consider asm on a two dimensional square lattice @xmath10 .",
    "to each site a height variable @xmath11 is assigned which takes its value from the set @xmath12 .",
    "this height variable shows the number of sand grains in the underling site .",
    "the dynamics of this model is as follows : in each step , one grain of sand is added to a randomly chosen site @xmath13 , i.e. @xmath14 . if the resulting height becomes more than 4 , the site topples and looses 4 grains of sand , each of which is transferred to one of four neighbors of the toppled site . as a result , the neighboring sites may become unstable and topple , and in this way a chain of topplings may happen in the system and in this way an avalanche forms . if a boundary site topples , one or two grains of sand ( for the sites in the corners of the lattice two grains and for the other boundary sites one grain ) will leave the system .",
    "the process of toppling continues until the system reaches a stable configuration in which no site has a height greater than 4 .",
    "the process is then repeated .",
    "there are two kind of configurations in asm : those configurations that may happen once and shall not happen again , which are called transient states , and those which are called recurrent states . in the steady state , no transient state occurs and the recurrent states all occur with the same probability .",
    "it has been shown that the total number of recurrent states is det@xmath15 where @xmath15 the discrete laplacian matrix . for more details",
    "see the reference@xcite .",
    "this model can be defined on other lattices . for a lattice in which the sites have @xmath16 neighbors , a site topples if its height exceeds @xmath16 , the site looses @xmath16 grains and the height of each of its neighbors",
    "will be increased by amount 1 . for technical purposes",
    "we have done our simulations on triangular lattice in which @xmath17 .",
    "much work has been done on distribution functions of size , area , gyration radius and etc.@xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the avalanches are not single fractal objects , while waves are@xcite .",
    "the waves are constructed in the following way : if , as a result of the addition of a grain to a site @xmath13 , the site becomes unstable , it topples , as do the sites which become unstable as a consequence of the toppling at site @xmath13 .",
    "the first wave is the collection of all sites which have toppled given that the initial site is not allowed to topple more than once .",
    "it is easy to see that in the wave , the set of toppled sites forms a connected cluster with no voids ( untoppled sites fully surrounded by toppled sites ) , and no site topples more than once . after the first wave is formed completely , if the site @xmath13 is still unstable , it topples once more to construct the second wave .",
    "the process continues until after a number of waves , the site @xmath13 becomes stable . +",
    "* dissipative asm *    in the off - critical set up the system has dissipation in the following sense : when the height of a site becomes greater than @xmath18(@xmath19 ) , then @xmath16 grains are transfered to the neighboring sites and @xmath20 grains leave the system .",
    "this means that during a toppling in the bulk , the number of sand grains is not conserved anymore , so the system is dissipative .",
    "the subject of non - conserved sandpile models has been discussed in @xcite and it has been shown that making the model dissipative takes the system to off - criticality . also , mahieu and ruelle showed that this system could be described by massive symplectic fermions@xcite : @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 and @xmath24 are complex grassmann variables . to study the model at small masses",
    ", we should be able to make the mass continuous .",
    "it is straightforward to generalize the theory to continuous mass@xcite . for simplicity in simulations , we take the mass to be a rational number . the dissipative model is constructed in the following way : let the threshold beyond which the column of grains becomes unstable be @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a arbitrary positive integer number and define @xmath27 .",
    "now , during a toppling ( @xmath28 ) , @xmath26 grains of sand are transferred to each neighboring site and 1 grain leaves the system . with this construction ,",
    "the effective dissipation will be @xmath29 .",
    "the correlation length of such a model is defined as a characteristic length above which the correlation functions of the model become negligible ( with respect to the their amount at small distances ) . at criticality ,",
    "the correlation length is of order of the size of the system and if the system is taken to be the whole two dimensional plane , it becomes infinite . in the off - critical state",
    "however , the correlation length is finite and is a function of the off - critical parameter .",
    "this length scale could be observed in many different properties of the model .",
    "for example , the green function of the model will have an exponential decay , rather than a power law .",
    "this exponential decay will show up in the correlation function of two site probabilities@xcite . also there will be a maximum size of an avalanche , say a typical radius , which is of the order of correlation length .",
    "for the scales much smaller than this length scale , again a critical behavior is observed , through power law behavior .",
    "critical statistical systems have special geometrical features .",
    "since in such systems there is no preferred length scale , the system is scale invariant and you can find fractal properties in different objects of the system . in two dimensions ,",
    "the algebraic aspect of this scale ( and conformal ) invariance has been well studied in terms of conformal field theories .",
    "however the geometric aspects of conformal symmetry is not clear in this approach .",
    "schramm - loewnwer evolution is a new approach focused on the geometrical properties of a single curve existing in the model , conditioned to start at the boundary , in the background of all the others .",
    "in fact , in this approach , instead of studying the local observables , we focus on the interfaces within two dimensional models .",
    "these domain walls are some non - intersecting curves which reflect the essential properties of the system in question .",
    "they are supposed to have two properties : conformal invariance and the domain markov property@xcite .",
    "schramm - loewner evolution is the candidate to analyze these random curves by classifying them to the one - parameter classes ( sle@xmath30 ) .",
    "sle@xmath30 is a growth process defined via conformal maps , @xmath31 , which are solutions of loewner s equation : @xmath32 where the initial condition is @xmath33 and @xmath34 is a continuous real valued function and is shown to be proportional to the brownian motion ( @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the one dimensional brownian motion and @xmath37 is the diffusivity constant ) if the curves have the two above properties . for fixed @xmath16",
    ", @xmath31 is well - defined up to time @xmath38 for which @xmath39 .",
    "let us denote the upper half plane by @xmath40 and @xmath41 as the sle trace i.e. @xmath42 and the hull @xmath43 . the complement @xmath44 is simply connected and @xmath31 is the conformal mapping @xmath45 with @xmath46 as @xmath47 that is known as hydrodynamical normalization .",
    "one can retrieve the sle trace by @xmath48 .",
    "there are phases for these curves , @xmath49 the trace is non - self - intersecting and it does not hit the real axis ; @xmath50 , but for @xmath51 , the trace touches it self and the real axis so that a typical point is surely swallowed as @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "it has also been shown that sle@xmath6 has correspondence with cft with central charge @xmath54 and at the point where the sle curve starts a boundary changing operator with weight @xmath55 is sitting@xcite .",
    "* sle out of criticality * ; tuning some external parameters , it is possible to take a system off its criticality . in this case",
    "the conformal invariance of the system is broken and the system s correlation length @xmath56 so that it will not be confused with the drive function @xmath57 is finite and will play a crucial role in statistical properties of the system .",
    "the question will then be that if we break the conformal symmetry , what would be the effect on schramm - loewner evolution . in other words , when the curves do not have conformal symmetry , then there is no guarantee that the drive function @xmath58 be proportional to a brownian motion , and its statistics have to change as we go away from criticality .",
    "however it is expected that at small scales ( comparing with correlation length ) i.e. in the ultraviolet regime ( uv ) , the deviations from criticality are small .",
    "this means that the interface should look locally like the critical interface and over short time periods , the off - critical driving function @xmath59 should not be much different from the critical state .",
    "on the other hand , at large scales ( comparing with @xmath56 ) , i.e. in the infrared regime , it is possible that the rg flow take the system to a new fixed point with conformal symmetry , and the interfaces look like another sle with a new @xmath60 . if this is the case , the overall behavior of the curve could be explained as follows : the growing curve forms some bulbs at small scales , with properties close to the original critical system ( with diffusivity @xmath61 ) .",
    "when the linear size of the bulb becomes comparable with the correlation length , the curve travels to a new region to form a new bulb .",
    "when we integrate out the small scale objects to reach the large scale properties , the bulbs which is formed by sle trace , may be seen as points that the sle trace crosses with the new diffusivity ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "one example is the ising model . at criticality",
    "we have @xmath63 , but if the temperature is raised above the critical point , renormalization group arguments indicate that at large scale the interfaces of the model look like the interfaces at infinite temperature i.e. percolation with @xmath64@xcite .",
    "it is interesting to see if this happen in some other models , such as asm i.e. @xmath1 theory",
    ". the question could be traced in the context of perturbed cfts@xcite .",
    "the special case we are interested in , is the perturbed logarithmic cft , as it is known the @xmath1 is actually a logarithmic cft . in @xcite",
    "various deformations to a lcft is considered and it is discussed that the ir fixed point of the massive perturbation of @xmath1 theory is @xmath65 conformal field theory .",
    "they proposed that this theory could be critical percolation in which the domain - walls separating black and white sites are sle@xmath66 ( whose dual sle is sle@xmath67 ( saw ) ) .",
    "in this section we present some numerical results on off - critical asm and its relation with sle . in the following subsection we focus on how off - criticality affect basic properties of asm and",
    "then we apply sle to the model to see what happens in presence of dissipation .      to have a feeling about the off - critical asm , let us study the above mentioned properties of the off - critical model : green function , two - point functions and the statistics of waves and avalanches of asm and its dependence on the dissipation",
    ".    * green function . * to begin , it would be proper to see how the green function changes as dissipation is introduced to the system .",
    "the green function of asm is defined as follows@xcite : @xmath68 is the number of topplings occurring in the site @xmath69 ( up to a normalization factor ) if you add a grain of sand to the site @xmath13 .",
    "it is easy to show that the green function is just the inverse of the matrix @xmath15 , therefore in two dimensions , asymptotically it behaves as a logarithmic function .",
    "the same matrix @xmath15 appears in the action of the field theory associated with the model whose continuous limit is the free massless grassmann action if there is no dissipation .",
    "now if we add dissipation , the grassmann field will become massive ( the action in eq[[action ] ] .",
    "therefore in this context , the new green function is the solution of the equation @xmath70-m^{2})g(r,\\acute{r})=\\delta(r-\\acute{r})$ ] which is the modified bessel function of 2nd kind .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of this function is @xmath71 which means that a correlation length @xmath72 is introduced to the system . at scales",
    "much less than the correlation length , the green function revive its critical logarithmic behavior .",
    "( 110,130)(0,0 )    on the other hand one can find the green function numerically from its definition stated above . in fig[[green ] ] the modified bessel function and the simulated result are sketched in a single plot . in the limit where the distance is much larger than the lattice spacing ,",
    "the two curves coincide .",
    "the inset graph shows this property . for small values of @xmath73 ,",
    "yet much larger than the lattice spacing , the simulated green function shows a logarithmic behavior as expected .",
    "* correlation function * one may ask what is the probability that two distinct sites , distance @xmath73 apart have heights equal to one , @xmath74 . the quantity @xmath75 ^ 2 $ ] then expresses the correlation function of height - one sites ( @xmath76 is the probability of finding a site with height 1 ) . there is a straightforward way to calculate this quantity based on a test called the burning test@xcite .",
    "it turns out that in the expression of the correlation function , the derivatives of green function appear .",
    "this may also be seen in the field theoretical approach , where it has been shown that the field associated with height 1 is proportional to @xmath77@xcite . in the presence of dissipation",
