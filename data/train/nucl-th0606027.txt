    "the present - day interpretation of qcd lattice simulations requires a profound understanding of the dependence of observable quantities on the light quark masses .",
    "a powerful tool to derive such dependencies is the chiral lagrangian , an effective field theory based on the chiral properties of qcd .",
    "the application of strict chiral perturbation theory to the su(3 ) flavor sector of qcd is plagued by poor convergence properties for processes involving baryons @xcite .",
    "thus it is important to establish partial summation schemes that enjoy improved convergence properties and that are better suited for chiral extrapolations of lattice simulations .",
    "it was suggested by donoghue and holstein @xcite to improve the convergence properties by introducing a finite cutoff into the heavy - baryon effective field theory of jenkins and manohar @xcite .",
    "another scheme was suggested in @xcite , the construction of which was guided by keeping manifestly covariance , analyticity and causality .",
    "the computation of the baryon octet and decuplet masses in this scheme was worked out recently indicating convincing convergence properties of the chiral loop expansion @xcite .    for studies of chiral extrapolations of the nucleon mass within the chiral su(2 ) lagrangian we refer to the work by procura , hemmert and weise @xcite .",
    "the latter study applied the partial summation scheme of becher and leutwyler @xcite .",
    "it was based on simulations of the cp - pacs collaboration that used dynamical u- and d - quarks only @xcite .",
    "the application of the scheme by becher and leutwyler @xcite to the chiral su(3 ) lagrangian is questioned by poor convergence properties as was demonstrated by ellis and torikoshi at hand of the baryon octet masses @xcite .",
    "the recent work of pascalutsa and vanderhagen @xcite suggested to take serious the partial summation implied by the extended on - mass shell scheme ( eoms ) introduced by gegelia and japaridze @xcite .",
    "their computation addressed so far the chiral extrapolation of the nucleon and isobar mass only .",
    "it is the purpose of the present work to confront the results of @xcite to recent lattice qcd simulation of the milc collaboration @xcite , that use dynamical u-,d- and s - quarks in the staggered approximation .",
    "we do not aim at a quantitative extrapolation of the lattice simulation , which would require a continuum limit extrapolation and a quantitative control of systematic errors .",
    "rather , we want to use the available partial lattice results to make predictions for future qcd lattice simulations and possibly obtain rough constraints on some chiral parameters .",
    "an analysis of the recent milc results , similar in spirit , was undertaken by frink and meiner @xcite based on the cutoff scheme of donoghue and holstein .",
    "adjusting the values of the @xmath3 counter terms to the physical masses we predict a discontinuous dependence of the baryon masses on the pion mass .",
    "this is a consequence of self consistency imposed on the partial summation approach , i.e. the masses used in the loop function are identical to those obtained from the baryon self energy .",

    "it should be emphasized that the baryon masses are a solution of a set of coupled and non - linear equations in the present scheme .",
    "this is a consequence of self consistency imposed on the partial summation approach .",
    "the latter is a crucial requirement since the loop functions depend sensitively on the precise values of the baryon masses . as a consequence of the non - linearity for a given parameter set",
    "there is no guarantee for a unique solution to exist , nor that solutions found are continuous in the quark masses . indeed as illustrated by fig .",
    "1 the pion - mass dependence predicted by the chiral loop expansion is quite non - trivial exhibiting various discontinuities . upon inspecting the energy dependence of the baryon self energies this",
    "is readily understood : the baryon self energies , as implied by ( [ octet ] , [ decuplet ] ) , allow in certain cases for multiple solutions of the mass equation , @xmath62 even though the self consistency requirement singles out a particular solution at @xmath63 .",
    "such a scenario appears inconsistent at first : the meson baryon loop functions have to be evaluated with all states provided by ( [ mass - equation ] ) .",
    "in contrast the computation of the meson - baryon loop functions ( [ octet ] , [ decuplet ] ) takes the existence of uniquely defined baryon states for granted .",
    "in addition it is assumed that the mass poles of the baryon propagators have residuum one .",
    "thus our computation considers implicitly additional counter terms of the form : @xmath64 where @xmath65 denotes the baryon masses that solve the self consistent system . if the term ( [ wave - function ] ) is added to the self energies it does not affect the solutions of the self consistent system .",
    "however , it does affect the energy dependence of the final baryon self energy . by adjusting the parameters @xmath66 , it is possible to arrive at uniquely defined baryon states .    within",
    "the scheme described above it is intuitive that for a given set of parameters multiple solutions of the self consistent system may exist .",
    "a priori it is not evident which of the possible solutions one should select .",
    "our strategy is to continuously evolve the solution established at physical pion masses to larger pion masses .",
    "similarly we evolve down to smaller pion masses the solution that reproduces the lattice simulations at the su(3 ) symmetric point defined by @xmath67 690 mev .",
    "both solutions reach end points beyond which we do not find any continuation . in the region of intermediate pion masses",
    "we , however , find another solution , suggesting a discontinuous dependence of the baryon masses on the quark masses of qcd .",
    "one may expect that the physical solutions are those of lowest mass always .",
    "the three branches discussed above are shown in fig . 1 and confronted with the simulation points of the milc collaboration @xcite .",
    "it is striking to see that we reproduce the mysterious pion - mass dependence of the @xmath2 mass , i.e. the quite flat behavior which does not seem to smoothly approach the physical mass .",
    "given the present uncertainties from finite lattice spacing , the staggered approximation and the theoretical uncertainties implied by higher order contributions , we would argue that we arrive at a fair representation of the lattice simulation points for all baryons with some reservation concerning the nucleon .",
    "we note that the parameter set used before in @xcite leads to results qualitative similar to those shown in fig . 1 for the baryon octet masses .",
    "while the description of the nucleon is improved showing no discontinuity at large pion masses , the sizeable jump of the @xmath2 mass at small pion masses remains .",
    "however , the milc simulation points of the isobar mass disfavor the latter choice .",
    "an overestimate of the lattice simulations of the isobar mass at larger quark masses would be the consequence .    incorporating the many @xmath68 counter terms offered by the chiral lagrangian it is reasonable to expect that the latter will further improve the picture .",
    "however , as long as there is no detailed analysis available that performs the continuum limit and estimates the uncertainty from the staggered fermion approximation there is not much point considering the @xmath68 counter terms .",
    "we evaluated the baryon octet and decuplet self energies at the one - loop level applying the relativistic chiral lagrangian . adjusting the @xmath3 counter terms an excellent representation of the physical baryon octet and decuplet masses",
    "is obtained .",
    "the size of the pion - nucleon sigma term was estimated by including in the fit the baryon octet and decuplet masses at the su(3 ) symmetric point defined by @xmath55 mev .",
