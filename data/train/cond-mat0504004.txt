    "carbon nanotubes have the potential to make good interconnects because current densities approaching @xmath3  @xcite and compatibility with silicon technology  @xcite have been demonstrated . in the use of multiwall nanotubes for such applications ,",
    "contact with as many layers of the tube as possible  @xcite is desirable .",
    "larger diameter nanotubes are preferable because even the semiconducting shells can carry current due to small bandgaps . for example , a semiconducting shell with a radius of 18.8 nm has a half bandgap of only 62.5 mev ( kt=26 mev at room temperature ) . experimentally measured conductance of metallic carbon nanotubes is close to the theoretical maximum of @xmath2 at low biases  @xcite .",
    "experiments on small diameter carbon nanotubes show that the differential conductance decreases with applied bias , for voltages larger than 100 - 200 mev  @xcite . ref .",
    "@xcite found that the conductance decrease with increase in bias was caused by reflection of incident electrons at crossing subbands due to scattering with zone boundary phonons .",
    "measured values of the mean free path  @xcite are in the range of 0.1 - 1 @xmath4 m at low bias and around 10 nm at high bias for 1.8 nm diameter nanotubes ( corresponds to a ( 24,0 ) nanotube ) .",
    "simple estimates of scattering rates  @xcite show inverse dependence with nanotube diameter , which suggests that phonon scattering is less important in large diameter nanotubes .",
    "the non crossing subbands of small diameter nanotubes do not carry current due to their large band gap .",
    "in contrast , large diameter nanotubes experimentally show an increase in conductance with applied bias  @xcite .",
    "reference @xcite suggested that as the diameter increases electrons may tunnel into non crossing subbands , thus causing an increase in differential conductance with applied bias .",
    "the main drawbacks of the calculation in reference @xcite was that the results depended on the assumed form of potential drop in metallic nanotubes ( charge self - consistency and phonon scattering were neglected ) .",
    "apart from measuring current - voltage characteristics , the potential drop can be measured by efm .",
    "@xcite found that the potential drop in a single wall nanotube was small compared to a multiwall nanotube .    in this work ,",
    "we computationally model ballistic electron flow in metallic nanowires within a tight - binding approximation by including _",

    "the potential distribution and current - voltage characteristics are studied as a function of both nanotube diameter and length . in 3d",
    "( bulk ) crystal the electric field , potential and net charge at the edges of the tube would decay exponentially , resulting in zero net charge and zero electric field inside the conductor . in a 1d wire ,",
    "even perfectly ballistic , the screening is poorer , due to the lower electron density of states .",
    "reference @xcite found that near _ p - n _ junctions in semiconducting nanotubes , this leads to a very long range ( @xmath5 ) tail in the charge distribution and , consequently , a non zero electric field very far from the junction .",
    "it is however an open question whether metallic nanotubes also have poor screening properties .",
    "here we use an electrostatics model similar to that in @xcite , but significantly improve on transport , using non equilibrium green s function formalism .",
    "the ballistic approximation works well at low bias and/or in large diameter nanotubes .",
    "the detailed study of phonon scattering effects will be given elsewhere .",
    "the nature of the metallic contacts is also important . from an experimental view",
    "point the contact between a metal and a nanotube can either be an end - contact or side - contact .",
    "the end - contact corresponds to only the nanotube tip making the contact to the metal lead . in experiments ,",
    "the end - contacts usually include strong chemical modification of the nanotube at the metal - nanotube interface .",
    "also , reference @xcite found that end - contacts without sufficient chemical modification of the nanotoube - metal interface have a large contact resistance .",
    "in such configuration , electrons are injected directly from the metal to the nanotube region between the contacts . due to the uncertainty of the contact bandstructure ,",
    "modeling end - contacts even remotely correct is extremely difficult .",
    "the side - contacts correspond to coupling between metal and nanotube atoms over many unit cells of the nanotube , and can be thought of as a nanotube buried inside a metal .",
    "most experimental configurations correspond to side - contacts @xcite .",
    "an important feature of the side contacts is that the coupling between atoms in the nanotube is much stronger than coupling between nanotube and metal atoms which means that the bandstructure of the contacts can be assumed to be the same as that of the nanotube between the contacts . in the side - contact geometry ,",
    "electrons are predominantly injected from the metal into the nanotube buried in the metal and then transmitted to the nanotube region between the contacts .",
    "in fact , as proof of such a process , scaling of conductance with contact area has been observed in the side - contacted geometry by references @xcite .",
    "modeling showed that the conductance in metallic zigzag nanotubes can be close to the theoretical maximum for conductance with sufficient overlap area in the contact @xcite .    in the work presented here , we assume `` perfect '' contacts to represent an ideal side - contacted nanotube .",
    "the details of the contact model will be given below .",
    "in this paper we consider only zigzag carbon nanotubes .",
    "the analysis for armchair nanotubes is similar .",
    "the general form of the hamiltonian for electrons in a carbon nanotube can be written as : @xmath6 the sum is taken over all rings @xmath7 in transport direction and all atoms located at @xmath8 in each ring .",
    "we make the following common approximations : i ) only nearest neighbors are included ; each atom in an @xmath9-coordinated carbon nanotube has three nearest neighbors , located @xmath10 1.42 @xmath11 away ; ii ) the bandstructure consists of only @xmath12-orbital , with the hopping parameter @xmath13 ev and the on - site potential @xmath14 .",

    "we obtain a decoupled electron hamiltonian in the eigenmode space : @xmath23 where @xmath24 the 1-d tight - binding hamiltonian @xmath25 describes a chain with two sites per unit cell with on - site potential @xmath26 and hopping parameters @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( fig .",

    "the contact self - energies @xmath37 due to the source contact are found @xcite using the surface green s function @xmath38 of a semi - infinite nanotube , which is the solution of the following system of equations : @xmath39 where the indices @xmath40 and @xmath41 stand for the two sites of the unit cell and @xmath42 .",
    "the green s function for the drain are solved for in a similar way , by making the following substitutions : @xmath43 , @xmath44 .    for each subband @xmath45",

    "the ballistic transport is also an adequate approximation at low bias for all diameter nanotubes due to the absence of strong inelastic phonon emission .",

    "note , that in the ballistic regime , resistance of the nanotube does not depend on tube length , which results in the drop at the edges being constant for all tube lengths .              while the total density of states ( dos ) per unit length of metallic nanotubes is independent of diameter ,",

    "another qualitative difference occurs at zero bias in ( 240,0 ) nanotube ( fig.[fig : didv ] ) .",
    "the zero bias conductance of ( 240,0 ) nanotube is larger than @xmath2 because the non crossing subbands are partially filled and contribute to current : the first non crossing subband opens at an energy of 2.4 @xmath94 from the band center .",

    "the important consequence of the different origin of these four peaks is the temperature dependence of differential conductance . at low temperatures ,",
    "the outermost peaks will vanish , reducing the value of conductance to @xmath2 .",
    "however , the height and shape of the inner peaks are insensitive to the temperature which implies the robustness of zener tunneling .    in conclusion , we find that in the ballistic ( low bias / large diameter ) regime , applied bias drops mostly at the edges .",
    "however , the 1-dimensionality of the nanotube leads to very slow ( @xmath95 ) screening of the electric field as compared to a bulk crystal . in agreement with experimental measurements of ref .",
