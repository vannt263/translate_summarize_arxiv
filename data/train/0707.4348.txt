    "pairing symmetry is an important issue towards understanding the mechanism of superconductivity . for hole - doped cuprate high-@xmath1 superconductor , it is generally accepted that the pairing symmetry is @xmath0-wave @xcite . on the other hand , although no consensus has been reached yet , more and more recent experiments have pointed out that the order parameter of electron - doped cuprate superconductors is also likely to have a @xmath0-wave pairing symmetry @xcite .",
    "interestingly however , angle resolved photoemission measurement ( arpes ) @xcite and raman scattering @xcite suggest a nonmonotonic @xmath0-wave order parameter with maxima close to the nodes ( diagonals ) rather than to the brillouin zone ( bz ) boundary .",
    "understanding the origin of the nonmonotonic @xmath0-wave order parameter becomes an important issue .",
    "yoshimura and hirashima performed a strong - coupling one - band calculation and claimed that the nomonotonic feature comes from a strong af spin fluctuation @xcite .",
    "in contrast to hole - doped cases , they @xcite found that the hot spots , the intersections of the magnetic bz boundary and the fermi surface ( fs ) , are located near the diagonals of the bz .",
    "alternatively it was also argued that the nonmonotonic feature of the order parameter is the outcome of the coexistence of the superconducting ( sc ) and the af orders @xcite . when af order coexists with the sc order , the resulting quasiparticle ( qp ) excitation can be gapped by both orders and behave to be nonmonotonic @xmath0-wave , even though the sc gap itself could have a typical monotonic @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "the clue to understand the electron doped cuprate comes from two doping - dependent fs as revealed by arpes @xcite .",
    "these are well explained in terms of the * k*-dependent band - folding effect associated with an af order which splits the band into upper- and lower - branches @xcite . in the sc state",
    ", the qps could pair each other within the same band that leads naturally to a two - band / two - gap model .",
    "the two - gap model gives a unified explanation for the upward feature near @xmath2 and the weak temperature dependence at low @xmath3 in superfluid density @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "it is also supported by hall coefficient and magneto - resistance measurements @xcite .",
    "raman scattering has the potential to probe different regions of the fs .",
    "it has been shown by lu and wang @xcite that sc and af orders in electron - doped cuprates are disentangled in raman spectra . in our earlier calculation on raman spectra @xcite",
    ", we have also proved that the raman shift for electron - doped cuprates is mainly determined by their pair breaking associated with different pieces of the fs .",
    "the af order can cause a vertex correction and enhance the spectral weight , but nevertheless , it does not change the raman symmetry . in particular , near the optimally - doped regime , the frequency of @xmath5 peak appears to be higher than that of @xmath6 peak @xcite .",
    "it seems indicating that the sc gap deviates from the monotonic @xmath0-wave .",
    "however , it has been shown that it is indeed two monotonic @xmath0-wave gaps , associated with @xmath7 and @xmath8-band fs respectively , which leads to a good description for it @xcite .    in this paper , spin dynamics",
    "is explored to further test the two - gap model for the electron - doped cuprates .",
    "spin fluctuation is observable by inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) , and is confirmed to be intimately connected with the pairing mechanism in hole - doped cuprates . in single ( cuo@xmath9 ) layer",
    "hole - doped cuprates such as la@xmath10sr@xmath11cuo@xmath12 , the magnetic peak is always incommensurate and their incommensurability is robust against the frequency change @xcite .",
    "( strong commensurate peak at momentum @xmath13 and some particular resonance frequency @xmath14 has been observed in multilayer yba@xmath9cu@xmath15o@xmath16 and bi@xmath9sr@xmath9cacu@xmath9o@xmath17 though @xcite . ) in current single - layer electron - doped cuprates such as nd@xmath10ce@xmath11cuo@xmath12 ( ncco ) , in contrast , commensurate peak at @xmath18 is observed both in the sc and normal states @xcite .",
    "these commensurate peaks survive over a wide frequency range .",
    "it will be shown later that the commensurability of these magnetic peaks is a natural outcome of the band nesting , and their robustness is actually incorporated into the existence of two separate bands .",
    "spin dynamics has been theoretically examined in various aspects for electron - doped cuprates lately @xcite .",
    "based on a mechanism making use of the strong af spin fluctuation , a pairing model will be proposed for the electron - doped cuprates .",
    "analogous to the hole - doped side , the sc gap function of the electron - doped cuprates is thus naturally to have the @xmath0 symmetry in the whole doping range .",
