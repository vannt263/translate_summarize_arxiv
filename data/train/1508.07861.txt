    "heavy fermion materials involve a lattice of localized magnetic moments derived from f - electrons , embedded in a conduction sea formed principally from delocalized d - electrons @xcite .",
    "the physics of these materials can be understood as a consequence of the interplay between two competing physical processes :    * the kondo effect , which tends to screen the local moments to produce a band of heavy electrons , and * antiferromagnetism , which locks the local moments together via the rkky interaction , into a state with long range magnetic order .",
    "the characteristic scales for these two processes are @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the strength of the onsite kondo interaction between the localized f - electrons and conduction electrons , @xmath4 is the density of states of the conduction electrons at the fermi energy and @xmath5 the bandwidth .",
    "the kondo temperature , @xmath6 , sets the energy scale for the onset of the kondo effect and consequently the formation of a coherent heavy fermi liquid ( hfl ) while @xmath7 defines the energy scale for the onset of magnetic order .",
    "the family of heavy fermion materials provides an important setting for the study of quantum criticality @xcite which develops when a continuous second - order phase transition is suppressed to absolute zero temperature .",
    "the small characteristic energy scales of these compounds makes them highly tunable , allowing the ready exploration of the phase diagram as a function of pressure , magnetic field or doping .",
    "superconductivity is often found in the vicinity of magnetic quantum critical points ( qcp ) . at temperatures above the quantum critical point non fermi liquid ( nfl ) behavior",
    "is observed , generally characterized by sub - quadratic temperature dependence of the resistivity @xmath8 and a logarithmic temperature dependence of the specific heat coefficient @xmath9 , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the characteristic scale of the spin fluctuations . for a review of experimental properties of these materials",
    "see stewart@xcite .",
    "one of the central challenges of heavy fermion materials is to understand the mechanism by which magnetism develops within the heavy electron fluid .",
    "traditionally , magnetism and heavy fermion behavior have been regarded as two mutually exclusive states , separated by a single quantum critical point . however , a variety of recent experiments suggest a richer state of affairs , in particular :    * ybrh@xmath12si@xmath12 can be driven to a quantum critical point by the application of magnetic field , where both the nel temperature and the kondo energy scale appear to simultaneously vanish . however",
    ", when doped , these two energy scales appear to separate from one - another , indicating that the break - down of fermi liquid behavior and the development of magnetism are not rigidly pinned together @xcite ; * in the 115 superconductor cerhin@xmath13 there is evidence for a microscopic and homogeneous coexistence of local moment magnetism and superconductivity under pressure @xcite ; * neutron scattering experiments observe a partially ordered state in the geometrically frustrated cepdal , in which one third of the ce moments do not participate in the long - range order , suggesting the development of inhomogeneous kondo states @xcite .",
    "various phenomenological frameworks have been proposed for the understanding of heavy fermion systems .",
    "the classical framework proposed in the 70 s by doniach @xcite , involves a competition between @xmath6 and @xmath7 determining the ground state to be a heavy fermi liquid or magnetically ordered .",
    "more recently a new axis was added to this picture , by the inclusion of geometric frustration or reduction of dimensionality @xcite .",
    "these two factors contribute towards the suppression of magnetism in a different way , if compared to the competition with the kondo effect .",
    "also , based on experiments in several families of heavy fermions , a phenomenological two - fluid picture was proposed by nakatsuji and pines , with predictive power on the ground state @xcite .",
    "unfortunately these proposals do not give us information about the character of the transition between the hfl and magnetic phases , and its theoretical description has remained an unsolved challenge for several decades .",
    "theoretical proposals based on a spin density wave description of the qcp @xcite , kondo breakdown @xcite , deconfined quantum criticality @xcite and local quantum criticality @xcite have been suggested , but no one picture is yet able to fully account for experimental observations .",
    "the kondo lattice hamiltonian @xmath14 provides a minimal model for heavy fermion systems .",
    "the first term in @xmath15 describes a band of conduction electrons with dispersion @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the antiferromagnetic kondo coupling between the local moment @xmath18 and the spin of the conduction electron @xmath19 at site @xmath20 .",
    "the local moments are neutral entities uniquely characterized by their spin quantum numbers .",
    "the removal of the charge degrees of freedom from the hilbert space of the localized f - electrons means that spin operators do not follow canonical commutation relations ; consequently , their treatment within a path integral or diagrammatic approach is complicated by the absence of a wick s theorem . to circumvent this difficulty , the spin operator is traditionally factorized in terms of creation and annihilation operators : @xmath21 where @xmath22 , @xmath23 are bosonic or fermionic creation and annihilation operators , respectively , and the indexes @xmath24 for an @xmath25 spin .",
    "there are actually several such spin representations : the holstein - primakoff @xcite , schwinger boson @xcite , abrikosov pseudo - fermion @xcite and the drone or majorana fermion @xcite representations , among others .",
    "the physics that each of these representations describes is profoundly different .",
    "for example , the antiferromagnetic ( afm ) phase at small @xmath17 is very effectively described by a schwinger boson representation of the local moments , with the condensation of the bosons corresponding to the onset of magnetic order @xcite . by contrast , the heavy fermi liquid phase at large @xmath3 is successfully captured by a fermionic representation of the spins @xcite .",
    "we take the view that the success of these two representations in the different limits is not simply one of mathematical convenience ; rather , it reflects the physical transformation of both the spin correlations and the excitations of the local moments : these evolve from collective spin waves to charged heavy fermions .",
    "remarkably , experiment indicates that these two phases connect together _ continuously _ via a quantum critical point , suggesting that at quantum criticality the two representations merge .",
    "in this paper we argue that a full description of heavy fermion materials requires a methodology that can capture the transformation in the character of the ground - state and its spin excitations .",
    "this , in turn , leads us to adopt a _",
    "representation of the spin@xcite @xmath26 here , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , @xmath30 are respectively , fermionic and bosonic creation and annihilation operators .",
    "the spin is _ supersymmetric _ because it is invariant under transformations that take bosons into fermions and vice versa ; these are generated by fermionic operators which will be introduced in the next section .",
    "one of the challenges of such a factorization , is that it requires a constraint which guarantees that the physics lies within the physical hilbert space @xcite .",
    "for example , an elementary spin @xmath31 kramers doublet requires the constraint @xmath32 . within this",
    "constrained hilbert space , the most general wavefunction is an _ entangled product _ @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the bosonic and fermionic components of the wavefunction , respectively , while @xmath35 is a gutzwiller projection operator .",
    "this operator can be written as : @xmath36 which imposes the constraint @xmath37 at each site @xmath20 .",
    "the unprojected wavefunction @xmath38 describes the formation of long - range magnetic correlations in the form of a bosonic rvb wavefunction , while @xmath39 captures the development of kondo of singlets and the development of a large fermi surface of heavy electrons .",
    "the gutzwiller projection entangles the two components of the wavefunction into a single entity as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : susypsi ] .",
    "this merged wavefunction has , in principle , the potential to capture the two - fluid aspect of the heavy fermion ground - state .     and the height @xmath40 of the tableau . ]",
    "the absence of a small parameter in the kondo model effectively rules out the use of conventional perturbation theory .",
    "the alternative approach , followed here , is the use of a large-@xmath41 expansion in which the fundamental representations contain @xmath41 , rather than @xmath42 components . in this approach @xmath43",
    "plays the role of synthetic planck s constant leading to a controlled mean - field ( `` classical '' ) theory in the large-@xmath41 limit , with the possibility of expanding the fluctuations and the constraint condition as a power - series in @xmath44 about the large-@xmath41 limit .",
    "the simplest generalization takes @xmath25 to @xmath45@xcite . written in traceless form",
    "the @xmath46 spin is then @xmath47 where @xmath48 .",
    "however , in this paper we seek to extend the supersymmetric description of spins to the symplectic subgroup @xmath1 of @xmath46@xcite : @xmath49 here @xmath41 must be even , while the range of the elementary spin quantum numbers is @xmath50 . the tilde notation , employed extensively in this article , denotes the sign of the index @xmath51 with the analogous definition for other indexes .",
    "this new spin operator has the symplectic property @xmath52 ( and is thus also traceless ) .",
    "the symplectic group @xmath53 offers many advantages for condensed matter physics , allowing for a consistent extension of the notion of time reversal symmetry to the large-@xmath41 limit , which permits one to form singlet pairs of particles that are absent in the @xmath46 generalization @xcite .",
    "this capability is vital to describe antiferromagnetism and superconductivity .",
    "the concept of a supersymmetric spin was introduced in previous studies of impurity kondo models @xcite . in the work presented here , we follow the lines of coleman et al.@xcite , with the additional generalization to @xmath1 , and discuss the spin representations in terms of young tableaux .",
    "young tableaux provide a precise pictorial rendition of irreducible spin representations : horizontal young tableaux label completely symmetric representations , which are naturally described by bosons , while vertical young tableaux label completely antisymmetric representations , usually described by fermions .",
    "the use of supersymmetric representations lead us to consider the set of representations characterized by l - shaped young tableaux ( fig .",
    "[ lshaped ] ) .",
    "these representations are characterized by two constants :    1 .   the total number of elementary spins ( or boxes ) in the representation @xmath54 , where @xmath40 and @xmath55 are height , and width of the young tableau , respectively , and 2 .   the asymmetry @xmath56 of the l - shaped young tableau , as discussed in coleman et al.@xcite .",
    "the asymmetry of the representation is absent in a physical @xmath25 spin-1/2 , in which case the young tableau is depicted by a single box , but once we enlarge the symmetry group of the spin in order to develop a large-@xmath41 theory , we find a family of representations that range from a completely symmetric representation , fully described by bosons , to a completely antisymmetric representation , described only by fermions , including a whole plethora of intermediate representations that we refer to as _ mixed representations _ , depicted by l - shaped young tableaux ( see fig .",
    "[ rep ] ) .",
    "the possibility of mean - field solutions described by mixed representations is interesting as it may permit the description of new states of matter , including coexistence of magnetism with superconductivity or with heavy fermi liquid phases .",
    "limit ranging from a fully symmetric ( top ) towards a fully antisymmetric ( bottom ) , passing through a series of l - shape representations . ]    for a given value of @xmath41 , one needs to decide which representation to choose in order to proceed with the calculations .",
    "traditionally a purely bosonic representation or a purely fermionic representation is chosen , but the supersymmetric approach provides the possibility of considering an l - shaped representation . to constrain the problem to such a representation one must fix the values of @xmath57 and @xmath58 through the introduction of projection operators into the partition function : @xmath59.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    typically , the more negative @xmath60 , the more symmetric the spin representation and the more magnetic the resulting ground - state whereas the more positive @xmath60 , the more antisymmetric the spin representation and the more fermi - liquid like the ground - state . to avoid biasing the physics , we consider a grand - canonical ensemble of representations defined by the partition function with indefinite asymmetry @xmath60 , @xmath61=\\sum_{y_0 } tr[p_{q_0 , y_0 } e^{-\\beta h}],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where now we can identify @xmath62 with the large-@xmath41 generalization of the gutzwiller projection operator introduced in eq .",
    "[ gutz ] : @xmath63    this procedure will enable the ensemble to explore the lowest energy configurations . another motivation to work with the constraint that fixes only the total number of boxes of the representation is the fact that the asymmetry of the representation appears only in the large-@xmath41 limit , so by letting @xmath60 run free provides an unbiased way to take the limit @xmath64 , as schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ rep ] .",
    "the large-@xmath41 limit we now develop places all l - shaped representations with a given number of boxes on the same footing , and the asymmetry of the representation can be thought of as a variational parameter .",
    "the character of the representation ( bosonic , fermionic or mixed ) will now be decided by the energetics of the problem .",
    "this will permit us to explore the phase diagram of systems as heavy fermions , in which the character of the spin changes from fermionic in the hfl phase towards bosonic in the afm region .",
    "[ spoint ] illustrates schematically the evolution of the energy landscape ( energy as a function of @xmath65 , the number of fermions in the representation ) , for three different values of @xmath66 . for small @xmath66",
    "the energy landscape has a minima for @xmath67 , which means that the system prefers to have a bosonic spin representation and possibly develops magnetic order .",
    "analogously , for large @xmath66 , the energy landscape has a minimum for the maximum value of @xmath68 , indicating a purely fermionic representation , which would possibly lead to the development of a heavy fermi liquid . for intermediate values of @xmath66",
    "we find that the representation is _ mixed _ , with an energy minima developing at an intermediate value of @xmath68 so that the minima is a saddle point as a function of @xmath65 .",
    "we are thus able to identify two classes of solution :    1 .   ,",
    "in which the free energy is minimized by a purely bosonic or a purely fermionic representation , indicating that the original supersymmetry of the spin is severely broken . in this case",
    "the results of a purely bosonic or fermionic representations are recovered ; 2 .",
    ", in which mixed representations are energetically favorable .",
    "these kinds of minima are candidate representations for a two - fluid picture of heavy fermions .",
    "since the fermionic and bosonic components of the spin fluid acquire the same chemical potential , this opens up the possibility of a new kind of zero mode : a _ goldstino _ , arising from the zero energy cost of rotations between the fermionic and bosonic spin fluid .     for different values of the ratio @xmath66 .",
    "]    other new features of this work are :    * _ symplectic spins _ : we generalize the rotation group of the spin from @xmath25 to @xmath1 for a large-@xmath41 treatment @xcite .",
    "this generalization guarantees that all the components of the generalized spin properly invert under time reversal which confers various advantages .",
    "in particular , it allows the description of geometrically frustrated magnetism@xcite and it permits the exploration of singlet superconductivity within the large-@xmath41 framework .    * _ spatially inhomogeneous representations _ : we explore the possibility of solutions which _ spontaneously _ develop kondo , or magnetic character at different sites . here",
    "we are motivated by the partially ordered phase verified experimentally in cepdal .",
