    "the molecular gas is dense enough that recombination is nearly total , so that very low fractions ( @xmath0 ) of the gas remains ionized while the rest of the gas is neutral @xcite .",
    "this small residual ionization is usually attributed to cosmic rays , which can penetrate nearly all clouds .",
    "ambipolar diffusion causes the relative drift of ions coupled to the magnetic field and neutrals in the molecular cloud cores and so it enable the cloud cores to collapse gravitationally",

    "in a current paradigm of star formation , magnetically supported molecular cloud cores must lose magnetic support through the action of ambipolar diffusion so that star formation can take place .",
    "recent works have focused on the role of turbulence in the formation of protostellar cores ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "including the effect of turbulence on the mechanism of ambipolar diffusion can enhance the ambipolar diffusion rate @xcite , so that the ambipolar diffusion timescale is significantly shorter than that estimated for a similar , but quiescent , medium . using three - dimensional numerical simulations , @xcite and @xcite have studied the properties of turbulence with ambipolar diffusion in a two - fluid approximation , while @xcite have investigated the heating through ambipolar diffusion in turbulent molecular clouds using a single - fluid approximation .",
    "shock waves in molecular clouds spread into steady - state continuous shocks , or c - type shocks , through ambipolar diffusion .",
    "if the shock speed is slower than the ion alfvn speed but faster than the neutral sound speed , the ions coupled to magnetic fields drag the neutrals into the postshock region , producing a continuous structure @xcite .",
    "these steady - state c - type shocks can , however , be unstable on a short enough timescale to be of astrophysical interest .",
    "@xcite showed that if the magnetic field lines are perturbed slightly and ions collect in the magnetic valleys , the ion - neutral friction may overcome the magnetic forces in the shock front and derive an exponentially growing instability .",
    "numerical treatments of ambipolar diffusion have been commonly derived from ideal magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) models .",
    "extensive numerical methods including ambipolar diffusion have been proposed in the study of the dynamics of partially ionized plasmas within the frame of single or two fluid models @xcite . @xcite",
    "have described an explicit method for one - fluid ambipolar diffusion in the strong coupling limit , while @xcite has used a semi - implicit scheme for two - fluid ambipolar diffusion to investigate instability in c - type shocks . @xcite",
    "have also presented a semi - implicit method for ambipolar diffusion using a two - fluid approximation .",
    "implicit schemes for the multifluid treatment of hall diffusion and ambipolar diffusion have been suggested by @xcite and @xcite .    in this work",
    "we describe a fully explicit method for incorporating the single - fluid ambipolar diffusion into a multidimensional mhd code based on the total variation diminishing scheme .",
    "the divergence - free condition of the magnetic field is ensured by a flux - interpolated constrained transport scheme , and a super time stepping method is used in order to considerably accelerate the otherwise painfully short diffusion - driven time steps .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in ",
    "2 the mhd equations are presented along with the approximations we have made and in  3 our numerical methods are described in detail .",
    "two test problems are presented in  4 , while mhd turbulence simulations with significant ambipolar diffusion follow in  5 .",
    "a summary is given in  6 .",
    "we assume the strong coupling approximation , i.e. , that the ion pressure and momentum are usually negligible in the weakly ionized plasma compared to those of the neutrals and so the magnetic force on the ions and the drag force exerted by the neutrals on the ions are almost equal . in this approximation",
    "the plasma can be represented as a single fluid .",
    "this single - fluid approximation turns out to be useful in the formation of molecular cloud cores through the process of ambipolar diffusion @xcite . to simplify the modeling of ambipolar diffusion here we assume isothermality with a constant sound speed in the ions and the neutrals and we ignore gravity .",
    "the isothermal mhd equations including ambipolar diffusion can then be written as @xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath3\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\times b$}\\right\\},\\ ] ] with the additional constraint for the absence of magnetic monopoles , @xmath4 here the equation of state is @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is an isothermal sound speed , @xmath7 is the collisional coupling constant between ions and neutrals , and @xmath8 is the ion density .",
    "the other variables @xmath9 , , and denote neutral density , neutral velocity , and magnetic field , respectively .",
    "we renormalize the magnetic field by defining @xmath10 throughout this paper so that the factor of @xmath11 does not appear in equations ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) .",
    "although the ion density in molecular clouds depends on complicated physical balance between the cosmic - ray ionization of neutrals and the recombination of ions and electrons on charged grains , for the purpose of simplicity we assume that the ion density scales as a power of the neutral density ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath12 by setting @xmath13 we further simplify by taking the ion density constant in this work , as these variations will not significantly affect the problems we treat . for conditions appropriate to molecular clouds ,",
    "however , the choice of @xmath14 usually would be more realistic , with @xmath15 most applicable at very high densities where grains are the main charge carriers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". on the other hand , the ion velocity is obtained from the equation for the relative drift velocity between ions and neutrals , @xmath16 this equation shows that the drag force and the magnetic force on the ions are balanced and that the ion - neutral drift velocity @xmath17 is always perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "the basic effect of ambipolar diffusion on the magnetic field can be expressed in a diffusion coefficient @xmath18 @xcite given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the mean collisional time between ions and neutrals and @xmath21 is the alfvn speed .",
    "then we can estimate the ambipolar diffusion timescale as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the characteristic length scale of magnetic field .",
    "the numerical scheme for solving the ideal mhd equations is described in previous works @xcite .",
    "this method is based on the total variation diminishing ( tvd ) scheme @xcite which is an explicit eulerian upwind scheme with a second - order accuracy in space and time . in the strong coupling approximation",
    "we can separate the ion density and velocity from the neutral density and velocity so that we can basically use the mhd tvd code to compute the evolution of the neutral density and velocity using mass and momentum conservation equations .",
    "we now describe how to incorporate ambipolar diffusion terms into the induction equation .",
    "the induction equation can be rewritten in component form as @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26 here the source term components are given by @xmath27,\\ ] ] @xmath28,\\ ] ] @xmath29.\\ ] ] note that the source terms on the right - hand side of equations ( 9 ) to ( 11 ) have the same divergence form as the flux components on the left - hand side .",
    "standard second - order finite difference operators are applied to the explicit discretization of the source components . here",
    "we define the source components at grid centers , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 , while the @xmath33-th components of the tvd flux vectors in each direction , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 , are defined at face centers .",
    "the first four components of the tvd flux vectors , @xmath37 through @xmath38 , are the upwind fluxes associated with the transport of mass and momentum , i.e. , mass and momentum advection fluxes , and the last three components of the tvd flux vectors , @xmath39 through @xmath40 , represent the components of the electric field . while keeping second - order accuracy , the source components",
    "can then be included in the tvd flux components as follows @xmath41 @xmath42 @xmath43 @xmath44 @xmath45 @xmath46 since the tvd scheme has second - order accuracy , the above second - order interpolation of the source components should be adequate .",
    "the contributions of the source components are added in a fully unsplit way after all the tvd flux components are updated through the tvd step .",
    "these total advective fluxes at face centers , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 , are used to enforce @xmath50 as described in the following subsection as well as to update the magnetic field components to the next time step .",
    "analytically the divergence - free condition @xmath50 is maintained if the condition holds for the initial magnetic field , but numerically the divergence of the magnetic field will not be exactly zero due to numerical discretization and dimensional splitting . several schemes to maintain @xmath50 constraint have been suggested and used in numerical mhd ( see * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite suggested the constrained transport ( ct ) scheme which used a specific finite difference discretization on a staggered mesh to satisfy the divergence - free constraint .",
    "the flux - interpolated ct schemes @xcite have introduced a new staggered magnetic field variable which is updated by simple finite differences using the interpolated fluxes .",
    "we have found the flux - interpolated ct scheme to be effective for incorporating ambipolar diffusion and have followed the approach suggested by @xcite .    using the total fluxes at face centers , equations ( 15 ) to ( 20 ) , the advective fluxes at grid edges are reconstructed with second - order accuracy as follows @xmath51 @xmath52 @xmath53 then the magnetic field components at face centers are updated as @xmath54 it is straightforward to show that @xmath55 if the numerical divergence of is initially zero .    in the tvd scheme for mhd ,",
    "all fluid quantities are defined at grid centers .",
    "thus the magnetic field components at grid centers are interpolated as @xmath56 @xmath57 @xmath58 note that the above arithmetic interpolation will be sufficient to maintain second - order accuracy .",
    "the time step for ambipolar diffusion is proportional to the square of the grid size in the single fluid approximation , so the explicit treatment of ambipolar diffusion terms leads to very small time steps @xcite . in the two fluid approximation that treats ions and neutrals separately , including the ion momentum equation severely limits the time steps via a very restrictive stability criterion . to resolve this problem ,",
    "previous papers have proposed different solutions .",
    "for instance , @xcite proposed a `` heavy - ion '' approximation to speed up the time steps , while @xcite set a density threshold below which the ambipolar diffusion rate is set to zero to avoid this problem . in this work",
    "we adopt the `` super time stepping '' approach @xcite to increase the effective time interval and allow much faster computations for ambipolar diffusion .",
    "@xcite also used this strategy in their multifluid mhd models .",
    "the super time stepping technique considerably accelerates the explicit schemes for parabolic problems @xcite .",
    "the key advantage of this approach is that it demands stability over large compound time steps , rather than over each of the constituent substeps . in this method ,",
    "the state vector is evolved over a super time step , @xmath59,\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is the nominal ambipolar diffusion timestep , @xmath33 is the number of substeps , and @xmath61 is a fuzzy factor ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "this super time step is defined as @xmath63 , and consists of the substeps , @xmath64 , which are given by @xmath65^{-1}.\\ ] ] it has been proven that @xmath66 as @xmath67 so that the super time step approach is asymptotically @xmath33 times faster than the standard explicit scheme @xcite . however , the @xmath61 parameter must be properly chosen for each problem in order to achieve optimality and stability of performance . for diffusion - dominated problems",
    ", @xmath60 drops below the typical courant time step , @xmath68 ( i.e. , @xmath69 ) .",
    "thus , if @xmath70 is taken to be the courant time step , the super time stepping method requires roughly @xmath71 substeps .",
    "in addition to allowing larger effective time steps , the super time stepping approach offers relatively simple implementation since it is a first order method . we have successfully applied this approach to the linear and nonlinear ambipolar diffusion problems presented in the following sections .",
    "our numerical results confirm the efficiency and accuracy of the super time stepping approach , as previously implemented in other approximations .",
    "we compute the structure of oblique c - type shocks in order to test the numerical methods described in the previous section .",
    "the steady state structure of a c - type shock is characterized conveniently by the shock length scale defined as @xmath72 following @xcite , the steady state equations are solved by setting @xmath73 in equations ( 1 ) to ( 3 ) , which then can be reduced to a single ordinary differential equation for @xmath9 .",
    "the steady state solution can be obtained through the numerical integration of the ordinary differential equation . in a separate code",
    "we numerically integrate the ordinary differential equation using the fourth - order runge - kutta method .",
    "this solution is specified by the three parameters , the sonic mach number @xmath74 , the alfvn mach number @xmath75 , and the angle @xmath76 between the shock normal and the magnetic field .    to generate c - type shocks we set up a two - dimensional shock heating problem . initially a gas with a neutral density @xmath9 propagates with a velocity against a reflecting wall placed at @xmath77 in the uniform magnetic field that lies at an angle @xmath76 to the @xmath78-axis . as the gas hits the reflecting wall , both the fluid and the magnetic field are compressed",
    ", the gas is heated and a reverse shock is produced .",
    "the ion - neutral friction drags the neutral gas into the postshock region , and finally the steady - state c - type shock is built up , yielding the appropriate continuous transition .",
    "the parameters we chose for this problem are @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 with @xmath84 .",
    "this problem has been set up with two inflow velocities , @xmath85 and @xmath86 , which correspond to the shock velocities @xmath87 and @xmath88 for our chosen parameters .",
    "this gives @xmath89 and @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath88 , and @xmath92 .",
    "the computations have been done in a two - dimensional box of @xmath93 $ ] with @xmath94 using @xmath95 cells .",
    "outflow boundary conditions are used except for a reflecting boundary imposed at @xmath77 .",
    "the parameters for the run shown in figure [ fig1](a ) are @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 and those for the run shown in figure [ fig1](b ) are @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath98 . in figure",
    "[ fig1 ] , the structure of neutral density , neutral ( red ) and ion ( blue ) velocity components , and magnetic field components from numerical calculations are marked with open circles and compared to analytic solutions plotted with solid lines .",
    "structures are measured along the @xmath78-direction before the shock reaches the outer boundary .",
    "the spike in the neutral density seen in a few cells near the reflecting wall is the overheating phenomenon .",
    "this is purely a numerical artifact that most finite difference schemes applied to the shock heating problem intrinsically possess since they can not compute the jump condition across strong shocks within a single cell . in all the flow variables , the structure of the c - type shock clearly forms .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the excellent agreement between the numerical solutions and the analytic solutions for the steady - state c - type shocks , demonstrating the accuracy of our numerical methods .",
    "the accuracy of numerical solutions depends on the number of cells spanned by the box size @xmath23 .",
    "so we have run the case of the test in figure [ fig1](a ) with different numerical resolutions to check the convergence properties . except for the resolutions the initial conditions are identical to those used in the test in figure [ fig1](a ) .",
    "we have computed the mean errors for neutral density defined by @xmath101 , where the superscript @xmath33 represents numerical solution and the superscript @xmath6 represents analytic solution .",
    "the resolutions of @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath95 , and @xmath105 cells give the mean errors of @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , and @xmath109 , respectively .",
    "as expected , the mean errors for neutral density converge as the numerical resolution increases . in this convergence test we also see that there are clear trends toward convergence in mean errors for velocity and magnetic field , and that a @xmath95 grid is sufficient to treat this problem .",
    "the propagation of alfvn waves in a weakly ionized plasma provides an effective tool for testing the dynamics of ambipolar diffusion .",

    "<S> we describe a method for incorporating ambipolar diffusion in the strong coupling approximation into a multidimensional magnetohydrodynamics code based on the total variation diminishing scheme . </S>",
    "<S> contributions from ambipolar diffusion terms are included by explicit finite difference operators in a fully unsplit way , maintaining second order accuracy . the divergence - free condition of magnetic fields is exactly ensured at all times by a flux - interpolated constrained transport scheme . </S>",
    "<S> the super time stepping method is used to accelerate the timestep in high resolution calculations and/or in strong ambipolar diffusion . </S>",
    "<S> we perform two test problems , the steady - state oblique c - type shocks and the decay of alfvn waves , confirming the accuracy and robustness of our numerical approach . </S>",
    "<S> results from the simulations of the compressible mhd turbulence with ambipolar diffusion show the flexibility of our method as well as its ability to follow complex mhd flows in the presence of ambipolar diffusion . </S>",
    "<S> these simulations show that the dissipation rate of mhd turbulence is strongly affected by the strength of ambipolar diffusion . </S>"
