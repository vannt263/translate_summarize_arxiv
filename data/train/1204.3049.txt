    "first , we fix the product of the mass and lattice constant to that used in the previous example ( rubidium atoms with @xmath140 ) and explore the effect of changing @xmath175 .",

    "+ according to expression , @xmath175 for a given initial band @xmath64 depends only on the width of the quasimomentum distribution ; the strength of the periodic potential , characterized by @xmath101 ; and the scaled force @xmath177 . for fixed values of these three parameters the oscillations preserve their shape and are only rescaled when the physical parameters , such as the bare mass or the lattice constant , are changed .",

    "however , as pointed out before , the estimate does not take into account the motion of the wavepacket through the brillouin zone over one bloch period since it was derived from the approximation , which misses completely the revival of the oscillations of the effective mass .",
    "the decay can be minimized or even removed if the oscillations of the effective mass do not have time to decay before the periodicity of the terms in ( over one bloch period ) returns the amplitude of the oscillations to the initial value .",

    "the second case is shown in figure  [ fig7 ] where , instead of changing @xmath177 , we increase @xmath101 in the parameters used for figures  [ fig4 ] and  [ fig5 ] so that the bands @xmath117 and @xmath115 become flatter and the reduced effective mass increases . in both figure  [ fig6 ] and figure  [ fig7 ] the spread of the wavepacket is the same as for figures  [ fig2]-[fig5 ] .",
    "we can control the decay by changing the spread of the wavepacket as shown in figure  [ fig8 ] , where we plot our results for sodium atoms with @xmath182 and @xmath139 ( as in figures  [ fig4 ] and  [ fig5 ] ) for a very small spread of the initial wavepacket ( @xmath183 ) .",
    "notice that in this case , instead of a decay of the oscillations after half a bloch period , there is a slight increase of the amplitude of the oscillations due to the higher sensitivity of the wavepacket to the changes of the momentum matrix elements and the energy differences at the center of the wavepacket as it moves through the brillouin zone .",
    "such small width in quasimomentum can be achieved experimentally in bose einstein condensates of sodium atoms @xcite .",

    "explored here ( from @xmath139 to @xmath185 ) , the effect of modifying @xmath101 on the amplitude of the oscillations is much smaller than the effect of @xmath177 ( compare figures  [ fig5 ] , [ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] ) .",
    "thus , in an experimental setting , the oscillations can be made more visible by increasing the force within the limits where zener tunneling is not significant .",

    "one of the reasons for this increase is the smaller gap between bands @xmath188 and @xmath191 at @xmath70 .",
    "both figures predict almost no decay , but the reasons are different .",
    "for the situation in figure  [ fig7 ] the cause is the small curvature of the band @xmath117 , which increases the reduced effective mass associated with @xmath117 and @xmath115 . in figure",
    "[ fig9 ] , on the other hand , the cause is the small spread in quasimomentum and not the curvature of the bands ; in fact , the larger magnitudes of the curvatures of @xmath188 and @xmath193 make the absolute value of the reduced effective mass associated with them smaller , and therefore the decay would be faster if the spread @xmath186 were the same as for figure  [ fig7 ] .",
    "+ the last example , shown in figure  [ fig10 ] , corresponds to a situation where the wavepacket is again in the lowest band , @xmath117 , but under a force that is approximately two times larger than the one used in previous examples with sodium atoms and produces an acceleration @xmath194 ; the strength of the potential is set to @xmath185 .",

    ", the most important contribution in the sum over the different bands in comes from the closest band to the initial one ; accordingly , the frequency of the oscillations is governed by the energy difference between these two bands as the wavepacket moves through the brillouin zone .",
    "the oscillations can decay because of the spread of the wavepacket in quasimomentum , but the periodicity of the momentum matrix elements and energy differences in produces a revival of the oscillations as the wavepacket completes a full bloch oscillation .",
    "+ we presented calculations for a toy model of a one - dimensional semiconductor illustrating the features described by pfirsch and spenke .",
    "the initial decay in this case is very fast ( femtosecond timescale ) and occurs while the wavepacket has moved over a small portion of the brillouin zone , allowing us to write a simple expression for the envelope function that controls the decay of the oscillations according to the predictions by pfirsch and spenke ( see expression [ e : aoscdefinitionapproxan ] ) .",
    "+ we also showed an analysis of the oscillations in a system of cold atoms in an optical lattice , where the timescales of the oscillations and the decay are much longer ( of the order of microseconds ) and comparable to a bloch period . we analysed the effects of tuning the different parameters , such as the force , the strength of the potential , the spread of the wavepacket in quasimomentum , the bare mass of the atom and the lattice constant .",
    "since the velocity of the atoms is a good candidate for experimental measurements , we plotted its expectation value , showing how the deviations from the usual effective mass prediction can be comparable to the oscillations calculated from the usual effective mass alone .",
    "since the decoherence in optical lattices is much smaller than in typical solid - state systems , it would be possible , in principle , to detect the oscillations during times of the order of a bloch oscillation . in the case of optical lattices ,",
