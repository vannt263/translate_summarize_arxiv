    "in 1972 j.c .  willems @xcite developed a general theory of dissipative systems for the purpose of stability analysis of open systems , that is , systems that may be subject to external influences , @xcite .",
    "this theory generalizes lyapunov methods that apply to closed systems , as well as important results in control theory including the positive and bounded real lemmas .",
    "the theory is widely used in control system analysis and design . in particular , methods for stability analysis , e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , control design by energy shaping , interconnection , robust control system design ; e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ,",
    "@xcite have been developed .",
    "while willems theory applies to quite general nonlinear systems , it has its origins in classical physical systems and is based on describing energy storage and flows . as a simple example , consider the passive series rlc circuit of figure [ fig : rc1 ] .",
    "energy @xmath0 is stored in the inductor and the capacitor ( here , @xmath1 is the impedance , @xmath2 is the capacitance , @xmath3 is capacitor charge , and @xmath4 is the current ) .",
    "the external voltage @xmath5 is related to the internal voltages by @xmath6 , with @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and this determines the dynamical equation @xmath10 .",
    "the rate of change of stored energy is given by @xmath11 the first term on the rhs is the energy dissipated by the resistor , and the second term is the power applied to the circuit by an external source .",
    "this expression describes the balance of energy flows , and implies the inequality @xmath12 which is an example ( in differential form ) of the _ dissipation inequalities _ considered by willems .",
    "it says simply that the rate at which energy is stored must be less than the rate at which energy is supplied ; the remainder being dissipated .",
    "inequalities of this type are of fundamental importance to stability analysis of open systems .",
    "furthermore , such inequalities can be exploited to facilitate control system design . because of the emerging need for analysis and design methods for quantum technologies , the purpose of this paper is to develop an analogous framework for open quantum systems .",

    "our modeling of dissipative quantum systems has its origins in the papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and represents inputs as the sum of a quantum noise term , used in physics to describe damping as mentioned above , and a signal term of the type used by willems to provide a means for the external world to influence the system .",

    "the crucial observation is that the energy balance relation ( [ rc - diss-1 ] ) and the dissipation inequality ( [ rc - diss-2 ] ) are to hold for all input signals @xmath5 .",
