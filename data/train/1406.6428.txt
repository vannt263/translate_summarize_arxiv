    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are close binary systems transferring matter from a low - mass dwarf secondary to a white dwarf .",
    "the transferred matter forms an accretion disk . in dwarf novae ( dne )",
    ", a class of cvs , thermal - viscous instability in the accretion disk causes outbursts .",
    "su uma - type dwarf novae , a subclass of dne , show long outbursts ( superoutburst ) in addition to ordinary short outbursts , and semi - periodic modulations called superhumps are detected during the superoutbursts .",
    "the superhumps have periods a few percent longer than the orbital period .",
    "it is now widely believed that the 3:1 resonance in the accretion disk causes the eccentric deformation of the disk , resulting superhumps [ tidal instability : @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ] .",
    "the superoutburst can be understood as a result of the increased tidal dissipation and removal of the angular momentum when the tidal instability works [ thermal tidal instability ( tti ) model : @xcite ; @xcite ] .",
    "this process produces a relaxation oscillation in the total angular momentum of the disk , and the superoutbursts recur .",
    "the interval between the successive superoutbursts is called supercycle . [ for general information of cvs , dne , su uma - type dwarf novae and superhumps , see e.g. @xcite ] .    in a series of papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite @xcite and @xcite , we systematically surveyed su uma - type dwarf novae particularly on period variations of superhumps .",
    "the change in the superhump period reflects the precession angular velocity of the eccentric ( or flexing ) disk , and is expected to be an excellent probe for studying the structure of the accretion disk during dwarf nova outbursts . in recent series of papers , we dealt with a various of topics related to su uma - type dwarf novae and superhumps : in @xcite , we also studied kepler data and made a pilot study of variations of superhumps amplitudes motivated by @xcite . in @xcite , we systematically studied er uma - type dwarf novae ( a class of su uma - type dwarf novae with very short supercycles , see e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and helium dwarf novae ( am cvn - type objects ) . in @xcite , we made a pilot study of the decline rate of the superoutburst motivated by @xcite and studied negative superhumps ( superhumps having periods shorter than the orbital period and are considered as a manifestation of a tilted disk , see e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) particularly in bk lyn , which displays both states of a novalike variable ( a thermally stable cv ) and an er uma - type dwarf nova .",
    "we continue this extended , comprehensive research of su uma - type dwarf novae and superhumps in general in this paper .",
    "since most of the objects treated in this paper is little documented in the past , and since a compilation of historical descriptions of dwarf novae has not been issued for long since @xcite , we intend these series of papers to be also a source of compiled information of individual dwarf novae .    the present advances in understanding of the superhump periods and their variations started with the new interpretation of the kepler observation @xcite , who used the negative superhumps as a probe for the variation of the disk radius over the supercycle , and confirmed the radius variation predicted by the tti model .",
    "combined with @xcite , @xcite , the tti model is currently the only viable model to explain the su uma - type phenomenon .    in @xcite , we demonstrated that most of the @xmath1 diagrams of superhumps in su uma - type dwarf novae can be expressed by three distinct stages : initial growing stage ( stage a ) wuth a long period and fully developed stage ( stage b ) with a systematically varying period and later stage c with a shorter , almost constant period .",
    "[ see @xcite for the notation of stages a - b - c of superhumps ] .",
    "the origin of these three stages of superhumps was a mystery when it was documented in @xcite .",
    "after examination of the kepler data , @xcite proposed that the appearance of the pressure effect is responsible for the transition from stage a to stage b. in this interpretation , stage a reflects the state when the 3:1 resonance is confined to the resonance region .",
    "this interpretation allowed a new method to determine the mass ratio ( @xmath2 ) only from superhump observations and the orbital period @xcite .",
    "this method is particularly suitable for measuring mass ratios in wz sge - type dwarf novae ( su uma - type dwarf novae with very long supercycles , and are considered to be the terminal stage of the cv evolution ) and for discriminating hitherto very poorly known period bouncers ( cvs which have passed the minimum orbital period in evolution : @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "superhumps are now not only a powerful tool for diagnosing the accretion disk , but also a powerful tool for illuminating the cv evolution .    the material and methods of analysis are given in section [ sec : obs ] , observations and analysis of individual objects including short discussions on individual objects are given in section [ sec : individual ] , the general discussion is given in section [ sec : discuss ] and the summary is given in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the data were obtained under campaigns led by the vsnet collaboration @xcite . for some objects",
    ", we used the public data from the aavso international databasehttp://www.aavso.org / data - download@xmath3 . ] .",
    "the majority of the data were acquired by time - resolved ccd photometry by using 30 cm - class telescopes located world - wide , whose observational details will be presented in future papers dealing with analysis and discussion on individual objects of interest .",
    "the list of outbursts and observers is summarized in table [ tab : outobs ] .",
    "the data analysis was performed just in the same way described in @xcite and @xcite and we mainly used r softwarehttp://cran.r - project.org/@xmath3 . ] for data analysis . in de - trending the data , we used both lower ( 15th order ) polynomial fitting and locally - weighted polynomial regression ( lowess : @xcite ) .",
    "the times of superhumps maxima were determined by the template fitting method as described in @xcite .",
    "the times of all observations are expressed in barycentric julian dates ( bjd ) .",
    "the abbreviations used in this paper are the same as in @xcite : @xmath4 means the orbital period and @xmath5 for the fractional superhump excess . since @xcite ,",
    "the alternative fractional superhump excess in the frequency unit @xmath6 has been introduced because this fractional superhump excess can be directly compared to the precession rate .",
    "we therefore used @xmath7 in referring the precession rate .",
    "we used phase dispersion minimization ( pdm ; @xcite ) for period analysis and 1@xmath8 errors for the pdm analysis was estimated by the methods of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we also used least absolute shrinkage and selection operator ( lasso ) method ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , which has been proven to yield very sharp signals . in this paper , we used the two - dimensional lasso power spectra as introduced in the analysis of the kepler data such as in @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite .",
    "these two - dimensional lasso power spectra have been proven to be helpful in detecting negative superhumps ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) as well as superhumps with varying frequencies ( cf .",
    "although the application of two - dimensional lasso power spectra to the kepler data dealt with almost uniformly sampled data , we have demonstrated in @xcite and @xcite that two - dimensional lasso power spectra are also effective in detecting multiple signals and their variations in non - uniformly sampled ground - based data .",
    "the resultant @xmath9 , @xmath10 and other parameters are listed in table [ tab : perlist ] in same format as in @xcite .",
    "the definitions of parameters @xmath11 and @xmath10 are the same as in @xcite .",
    "we also presented comparisons of @xmath1 diagrams between different superoutbursts since this has been one of the motivations of these surveys ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) and it has been demonstrated that a combination of @xmath1 diagrams between different superoutbursts can better describe the overall pattern of the period variation @xcite . in drawing combined @xmath1 diagrams , we usually used @xmath12 for the start of the superoutburst , which usually refers to the first positive detection of the outburst .",
    "this epoch usually has an accuracy of @xmath131 d for well - observed objects , and if the outburst was not sufficiently observed , we mentioned how to estimated @xmath14 in such an outburst .",
    "we also present representative @xmath1 diagrams and light curves especially for wz sge - type dwarf novae , which are not expected to undergo outbursts in the near future . in all figures ,",
    "the binned magnitudes and @xmath1 values are accompnied by 1@xmath8 error bars , which are omitted when the error is smaller than the plot mark .",
    "we used the same terminology of superhumps summarized in @xcite .",
    "we especially call attention to the term `` late superhumps '' .",
    "we only used `` traditional '' late superhumps when an @xmath130.5 phase shift is confirmed [ @xcite ; see also table 1 in @xcite for various types of superhumps ] , since we suspect that many of the past claims of detections of `` late superhumps '' were likely stage c superhumps [ cf .",
    "@xcite ; note that the kepler observation of v585 lyr also demonstrated this persistent stage c superhumps without a phase shift @xcite ] .",
    "early superhumps are double - wave humps seen during the early stages of wz sge - type dwarf novae , and have period close to the orbital periods ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we used the period of early superhumps as approximate orbital period .",
    "the validity of this assumption is also reviewed in this paper .",
    "as in @xcite , we have used coordinate - based optical transient ( ot ) designations for some objects , such as catalina real - time transient survey ( crts ; @xcite)http://nesssi.cacr.caltech.edu / catalina/@xmath3 . for the information of the individual catalina cvs ,",

    "in addition to basic data of superhumps of the objects observed in this paper , the major findings we obtained can be summarized as follows .",
    "* we report the detection of negative superhumps in quiescence of vw hyi in 2012 .",
    "we conclude that type l supercycle in vw hyi ( reduced number of normal outbursts ) is associated with the presence of negative superhumps as in v1504 cyg and v344 lyr .",
    "* master j005740 is the first eclipsing wz sge - type dwarf nova showing the probable eclipse of the white dwarf .",
    "the sharp structure in the profile of the early superhumps is interpreted as the eclipse of the accretion disk , which has been difficult to distinguish from the profile of the early superhump itself in other wz sge - type dwarf novae .",
    "the symmetric profile of the eclipse indicates that the disk itself , not the enhanced hot spot , is eclipsed .",
    "this finding gives observational support to @xcite who interpreted that the source of the early superhumps is not the hot spot as suggested by an enhanced mass - transfer model @xcite .",
    "we also provided a model calculation of the eclipse light curve of this object during the phase of early superhumps .",
    "* we detected stage a superhumps with growing amplitudes in mn dra and likely stage a ( from the @xmath1 diagram ) in gz cnc , both of which have long orbital periods .",
    "the stage a superhumps in these systems lasted longer than expected .",
    "we interpreted that the 3:1 resonance was confined in the region of excitement because these objects have mass - ratios critically close to the condition in which the tidal instability occurs .",
    "this may provide an interpretation of large negative period derivatives recorded in the past in systems with long orbital periods . * the 2013 superoutburst of uz boo was followed by four post - superoutburst rebrightening as was observed in the 2003 superoutburst .",
    "this observation suggests that the pattern of rebrightening tends to be reproducible in the same object . *",
    "the wz sge - type dwarf novae al com and asassn-13ck showed a long - lasting ( plateau - type ) rebrightening . in the early phase of the rebrightening",
    ", both objects showed a precursor - like outburst , suggesting that the long - lasting rebrightening is triggered by a precursor outburst .",
    "both objects showed small dip(s ) during the rebrightening .",
    "* we have reviewed the observation of early superhumps of wz sge - type dwarf novae and found that the fractional superhump excesses for early superhumps have a typical value of @xmath16% .",
