    "while the methods used in particle physics tend to be rather different from the microscopic approaches taken by condensed matter physicists , there is though one fully systematic analytic method that can be applied to both sectors .",
    "the effective lagrangian method , based on a symmetry analysis of the underlying theory , makes use of the fact that the low - energy dynamics is dominated by goldstone bosons which emerge from the spontaneously broken symmetry : chiral symmetry su(3)@xmath1 su(3)@xmath2 su(3)@xmath3 in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , spin rotation symmetry o(3 ) @xmath4 o(2 ) in the context of ferromagnets .",
    "the method thus connects systems as disparate as qcd and ferromagnets from a universal point of view based on symmetry .",
    "the low - energy properties of the system are an immediate consequence of the spontaneously broken symmetry , while the specific microscopic details only manifest themselves in the values of a few effective constants .",
    "still , as we are dealing with nonrelativistic kinematics in the case of the ferromagnet , apart from analogies , there are important differences : most remarkably , the effective lagrangian method , unlike for systems with relativistic kinematics , perfectly works for ferromagnets in one spatial dimension ( @xmath0=1 ) .",
    "while the low - temperature behavior of qcd was discussed more than two decades ago within effective field theory @xcite , the low - temperature properties of ferromagnetic crystals , films and spin chains were considered only very recently within the effective lagrangian framework @xcite . in the present article we review both qcd and ferromagnets , trying to build a bridge between the particle physics and condensed matter communities .",
    "for example , so - called chiral logarithms , well - known in lorentz - invariant effective theories in @xmath5=3 + 1 , also show up in the context of ferromagnets in @xmath5=2 + 1 dimensions ( our notation is @xmath5=@xmath0 + 1 , where @xmath0 is the spatial dimension ) .    in the first part of this review , an outline of the effective lagrangian method is provided , covering both relativistic and nonrelativistic kinematics . in the second part we present the low - temperature expansions for the pressure and the order parameters , i.e. , the quark condensate in qcd and the spontaneous magnetization in the context of ferromagnets . in particular , by considering the suppression of loop diagrams and the absorption of ultraviolet divergences , we point out analogies and differences in the low - temperature behavior of ferromagnetic systems and qcd .    as is well - known , qcd  the theory of the strong interaction  can not be solved perturbatively at low energies where the qcd coupling constant is not a small parameter . therefore its effective theory - chiral perturbation theory ( chpt )  based on an expansion in powers of energy and momenta , rather than on an expansion in powers of the qcd coupling constant , represents an indispensable tool to explore the low - energy domain of qcd . in the case of ferromagnets , the heisenberg model can be solved at low energies by microscopic methods . here , effective",
    "lagrangians thus represent an alternative scheme which is , however , more efficient than conventional methods such as spin - wave theory .",
    "a crucial point is that the effective lagrangian technique is fully systematic and model independent , and does not resort to any approximations or _",
    "ad hoc _ assumptions . to appreciate the power of the effective method",
    ", we mention that  until dyson s monumental work on the @xmath5=3 + 1 ferromagnet @xcite  it was unclear at which order in the low - temperature expansion of the spontaneous magnetization the spin - wave interaction shows up . while the correct answer is @xmath6 @xcite , other researchers obtained @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( see refs .",

    ", it was straightforward to confirm dyson s result @xcite .",
    "likewise , the effective method allowed one to go beyond dyson , demonstrating that the first interaction correction to @xmath6 is of order @xmath10 @xcite , whereas all other proposals in the literature , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , are incorrect @xcite .    in @xmath0=1,2",
    "the analogous question regarding the spin - wave interaction has largely been ignored in the many relevant articles @xcite , which are based on methods as diverse as spin - wave theory , schwinger - boson mean - field theory , green functions , scaling methods and numerical simulations .",
    "the impact of the spin - wave interaction in ferromagnetic films and spin chains was first addressed systematically and conclusively solved with effective lagrangians in refs .",
    "the link between the underlying , or microscopic , theory  qcd lagrangian and heisenberg hamiltonian in the present context  and the effective theory is provided by symmetry . the effective action @xmath14 must be invariant under all the symmetries of the underlying theory @xcite .",

    "we first consider lorentz - invariant theories . in quantum chromodynamics ,",
    "the underlying lagrangian is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the strong coupling constant , @xmath18 is the quark field , @xmath19 is the field strength of the gluon field , @xmath20 is the quark mass matrix , and tr@xmath21 denotes the trace of a color matrix . in the chiral limit ( i.e. , when the quark masses @xmath22 are sent to zero ) the above expression is invariant under the chiral transformation su(3)@xmath1 su(3)@xmath23 .",
    "the qcd vacuum , on the other hand , is only invariant under su(3)@xmath3 , such that the chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "theorem @xcite then implies that we have eight pseudoscalar mesons in the low - energy spectrum of qcd , which are identified with the three pions , the four kaons and the @xmath24-particle . in the real world where the quark masses are different from zero , the chiral symmetry of the qcd lagrangian is not exact , but only approximate",

    "the summation only extends over nearest neighbors , and the exchange coupling constant @xmath32 is purely isotropic .",

    "both quantities are order parameters , their nonzero values signaling spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "although the spontaneous symmetry breaking pattern o(3 ) @xmath4 o(2 ) gives rise to two magnon fields according to goldstone s theorem @xcite , in a nonrelativistic setting only one type of spin - wave excitation  or one magnon particle  exists in the low - energy spectrum of the ferromagnet @xcite . unlike in a lorentz - invariant framework , there is no 1:1-correspondence between the number of goldstone fields and goldstone particles .",
    "after this brief review of the underlying theories ( qcd lagrangian and heisenberg hamiltonian ) we now proceed with the discussion of the corresponding effective theories .",
    "chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) @xcite is well - established in particle physics .",
    "it exploits the fact that the low - energy dynamics of qcd is dominated by pions , kaons and the @xmath24-particle , i.e. the goldstone bosons of the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry .",
    "these are the relevant degrees of freedom that appear in the effective lagrangian @xmath15 .",

    "the leading effective lagrangian is of momentum order @xmath39 , @xmath40 where the matrix @xmath41 contains the eight goldstone boson fields @xmath42 , with @xmath43 as gell - mann matrices .",
    "the structure of the above terms is unambiguously fixed by chiral and lorentz symmetry : these are the symmetries of the underlying theory which the effective theory inherits . note that , at this order , there are two _ a priori _ unknown low - energy constants , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , that are not determined by the symmetries and hence have to be determined experimentally .",
    "pseudoscalar mesons obey a relativistic dispersion law , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the renormalized goldstone boson mass , and @xmath48 involve low - energy ( or effective ) constants from the subleading pieces @xmath49 and @xmath50 of the effective lagrangian @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the effective lagrangian method was transferred to nonrelativistic systems . a crucial point of",
    "that analysis is that for nonrelativistic kinematics , order parameters related to the generators of the spontaneously broken group , show up as effective constants of a topological term which dominates the low - energy dynamics .",

    "for the ferromagnet , the leading contribution in @xmath51 is of momentum order @xmath39 @xcite , @xmath52 the effective constant of the topological term , involving one time derivative ( @xmath53 ) only , is the ( zero - temperature ) spontaneous magnetization @xmath54 .",

    "it is important to note that , unlike in chpt , time and space derivatives are not on the same footing in the case of nonrelativistic kinematics : two powers of momentum count as only one power of energy or temperature : @xmath61 .",
    "finally we point out that the leading - order effective lagrangian @xmath62 is space - rotation invariant , although the underlying heisenberg model is not .",

    "what is most remarkable from a conceptual point of view is that the effective method perfectly works in one spatial dimension in the case of nonrelativistic kinematics , whereas in a lorentz - invariant setting the method fails in @xmath0=1 .",
    "the reason is that the perturbative evaluation of the partition function is based on the suppression of loop diagrams by some power of momenta .",

    ", a loop corresponds to the integral @xmath63 which , on dimensional grounds , is proportional to @xmath0 powers of momentum . in particular , loops related to ferromagnetic spin chains are still suppressed by one power of momentum .    for systems with a linear ( relativistic ) dispersion relation , obeyed e.g. by the pseudoscalar mesons in the chiral limit ,",
    "the loop suppression is rather different : there a loop involves the integral @xmath64 for lorentz - invariant systems , loops in @xmath0=3(2 ) are suppressed by two ( one ) power of momentum .",

    "these nlo constants then undergo logarithmic renormalization @xcite . for the ferromagnet in @xmath0 spatial dimensions ,",
    "the cateye diagram is proportional to @xmath73 in the case of ferromagnetic films ( @xmath74 ) , the above regularized expression is divergent . much like in chiral perturbation theory ,",

    "they are finite as they stand .",
    "the fact that there are no ultraviolet singularities in @xmath0=1,3 is crucial for the nonrelativistic effective framework to be consistent : in @xmath0=1 ( fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] ) and @xmath0=3 ( fig .  [ figure1 ] ) , the cateye graph is of different order than the two - loop contributions with vertices from @xmath66 .",
    "in contrast to @xmath0=2 , where three - loop and two - loop graphs `` communicate '' ( they are of the same momentum order @xmath76 ) and the uv - singularities can thus be absorbed by @xmath66 constants , the effective loop analysis appears to be inconsistent in @xmath0=1,3 : there are no two - loop diagrams available to absorb the `` divergences '' of the cateye graphs 11c ( fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] ) and 5c ( fig .",

    "the puzzle is solved by noticing that in @xmath0=1,3 , the cateye graph is not divergent and that the perturbative scheme hence is perfectly consistent .",
    "we end our discussion of partition function diagrams by pointing out that , on the two - loop level , there is an important difference between chiral perturbation theory and ferromagnets . while graph 6a ( fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] ) in chpt does contribute to the partition function , the same diagram for ferromagnets in any @xmath0 ( i.e. , including graph 8 of fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] and graph 4 of fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] ) turns out to be zero because of parity @xcite . as a consequence , in the thermodynamic quantities the spin - wave interaction , in general , is weaker than the interaction among the pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "the fact that the two - loop graph in question does not contribute in the case of the ferromagnet , may be rather surprising to readers trained in chiral perturbation theory , where this two - loop graph indeed does contribute to the partition function @xcite .",
    "we are dealing here with one of the novel effects that occur in the case of nonrelativistic kinematics .",
    "in fact , any of the three terms in the leading - order effective lagrangian ( [ leadinglagrangian ] ) yields expressions with four magnon fields that appear to lead to a nonzero contribution for the two - loop graph .",
    "however , making use of the leading - order equation for the magnon propagator  much like using the leading - order equation for the pion propagator in chiral perturbation theory ",
    "these different contributions can be reduced to a single one , proportional to @xmath77_{x=0 } \\ , [ { \\partial}_r g(x ) ] _ { x=0}$ ] , where the time derivative and the magnetic field have been eliminated .",
    "one therefore concludes that this two - loop graph , in the context of ferromagnets , does not contribute to the partition function due to parity .",
    "on the other hand , the same two - loop diagram in chiral perturbation theory is proportional to @xmath78_{x=0 } [ g(x)]_{x=0}$ ] .",
    "we now consider the low - temperature series for the pressure , starting with the ferromagnet . while the leading terms in the pressure @xmath79 are of order ( @xmath80 ) in @xmath0=(3,2,1 ) , the spin - wave interaction only emerges at ( @xmath81 ) , @xmath82 note that all interaction terms are boldfaced . since the two - loop diagram with an insertion from @xmath62 does not contribute ( diagram 6a in fig",
    ".  [ figure2 ] ) , interaction terms of order ( @xmath83 ) in @xmath0=(3,2,1 ) are absent .",
    "one further notices that the higher the spatial dimension , the less important the interaction becomes : there are more terms related to noninteracting magnons , until the interaction sets in . in particular , as dyson showed a long time ago @xcite , the spin - wave interaction in the case of the three - dimensional ferromagnet only manifests itself at order @xmath11 in the pressure , i.e. , far beyond the leading bloch term of order @xmath84 .",
    "interestingly , ferromagnets in two spatial dimensions develop a logarithm , because in the limit @xmath37 the cateye graph diverges logarithmically like @xmath85 @xcite . in chiral perturbation theory , the situation is analogous : in the chiral limit ( @xmath86 ) , the cateye graph diverges like @xmath87 @xcite , such that we also have a logarithmic contribution in the low - temperature series of the pressure , @xmath88 but , unlike for @xmath0=2 ferromagnets , an analogous term @xmath89 ( without @xmath90 ) is absent .",
    "this is because in chiral perturbation theory all effective @xmath66 constants undergo logarithmic renormalization , whereas for @xmath0=2 ferromagnets only part of them @xcite .    in @xmath0=1,3 ,",
    "the leading terms involve half - integer powers of the temperature , while loops are further suppressed by powers of @xmath91 ( @xmath92 ) in @xmath0=1(3 ) . for odd spatial dimensions the pressure for ferromagnets thus exhibits both integer and half - integer powers of @xmath93 .",
    "in the case of ferromagnetic films , on the other hand , the leading term in the pressure is of order @xmath94 . since here",
    "loops are suppressed by one power of @xmath93 , the series does not involve any half - integer temperature powers .",
    "however , as we have pointed out before , logarithmic contributions emerge . in the limit @xmath95 , the coefficients @xmath96 formally become @xmath93-independent , while for @xmath97 they are complicated functions of the ratios @xmath98 and @xmath99 @xcite .",
    "note however , as we discuss below , that the limit @xmath100 is problematic in @xmath101 .",
    "finally , the low - temperature series of the magnetization of ferromagnets , @xmath102 in three , two and one spatial dimensions , amount to @xmath103 the low - temperature expansion for the analogous quantity in qcd , the quark condensate @xmath104 reads @xmath105 again , for nonzero magnetic field and nonzero quark masses , the coefficients @xmath106 and @xmath107 depend on the ratios @xmath98 and @xmath99 in a nontrivial way . in the chiral limit ( @xmath86 ) , the leading coefficient @xmath108 in the quark condensate reduces to @xmath109 .",
    "the leading coefficient in the spontaneous magnetization of the @xmath0=3 ferromagnet becomes @xmath110 .",
    "the temperature scale in chiral perturbation theory is thus given by @xmath111 , which roughly corresponds to the temperature where the chiral phase transition takes place @xcite .",
    "in the case of the @xmath0=3 ferromagnet , the temperature scale is @xmath112 , which is roughly of the order of the curie temperature where the spontaneous magnetization becomes zero .",
    "although these scales differ in more than ten orders of magnitude , the effective theory captures both systems from a universal perspective based on symmetry .",
    "in particular , for temperatures small compared to the corresponding scales @xmath113 and @xmath114 , the series presented in this review are perfectly valid .",
    "it is important to point out that in one and two spatial dimensions , the leading coefficients @xmath115 and @xmath116 in the magnetization become divergent in the limit @xmath37 .",
    "this is related to the mermin - wagner theorem @xcite , stating that spontaneous symmetry breaking in @xmath117 can not occur at finite temperature in the heisenberg model .",
    "according to eqs .",
    "( [ magnetizations ] ) , the magnetization @xmath118 , in any dimension @xmath0=1,2,3 , tends to zero at a `` critical '' temperature @xmath119 , where the spontaneously broken symmetry is restored .",
    "while @xmath119 in @xmath0=3 tends to a finite value in the limit @xmath37 ( much like for the quark condensate , @xmath119 tends to a finite value in the chiral limit ) , the `` critical '' temperatures in @xmath0=1,2 tend to zero if the magnetic field is switched off .",
    "spontaneous symmetry breaking never occurs here at finite temperature  that is how the effective theory `` knows '' about the mermin - wagner theorem .",
    "in addition , in @xmath101 , an energy gap is generated nonperturbatively at finite temperature @xcite . strictly speaking",
    "this also implies that the limit @xmath37 can not be taken in @xmath117 , neither in the pressure nor in the magnetization , because we would then leave the domain of validity where the effective expansion applies @xcite .",
    "still , in two spatial dimensions , where the the nonperturbatively generated correlation length @xmath120 is exponentially large ( @xmath121 ) , this effect is tiny in the pressure , and does not numerically affect the corresponding low - temperature series . in the context of ferromagnetic spin chains , however , where the nonperturbatively generated correlation length is proportional to the inverse temperature ( @xmath122 ) , it would be completely inconsistent to switch off the magnetic field even in the low - temperature series of the pressure @xcite .",
    "it is important to point out that these subtleties in one and two spatial dimensions only emerge at finite temperature . in particular , at @xmath123 the limit @xmath37 is well defined in @xmath117 .",
    "much like in chiral perturbation theory or in ferromagnetic systems in @xmath124 , no divergent behavior of the observables occurs . in other words , the `` chiral limit ''",
    "@xmath37 is not problematic for ferromagnets living in one or two spatial dimensions at zero temperature .",
    "however , if the temperature is finite , then the magnetic field can not be totally switched off in @xmath117 , because one would then leave the domain of validity of the effective expansion . as discussed in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite , this parameter regime where the effective expansion breaks down , is tiny .",
    "again , this observation is related to the mermin - wagner theorem and the nonperturbatively generated energy gap .",
    "the systematic effective lagrangian method is a very useful tool also in the nonrelativistic domain where it even works in one spatial dimension .",
    "the method is appealing due to its universal character , interconnecting different branches of physics , such as particle and condensed matter physics .",
    "chiral logarithms showing up in the renormalization of next - to - leading order effective constants in chiral perturbation theory and @xmath0=2 ferromagnets , e.g. , are due to analogous ultraviolet divergences . in general , the structure of the low - temperature series  both in relativistic and nonrelativistic effective field theory  is an immediate consequence of the spontaneously broken symmetry .",
