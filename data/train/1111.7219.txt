    "the remarkable speed and multiplexing capability of optics makes it very attractive for information processing .",
    "these features have enabled the telecommunications revolution of the past decades . however , so far they have not been exploited insomuch as computation is concerned .",
    "the reason is that optical nonlinearities are very difficult to harness : it remains challenging to just demonstrate optical logic gates , let alone compete with digital electronics@xcite .",
    "this suggests that a much more flexible approach is called for , which would exploit as much as possible the strenghts of optics without trying to mimic digital electronics .",
    "reservoir computing @xcite , a recently introduced , bio - inspired approach to artificial intelligence , may provide such an opportunity .    here",
    "we report the first experimental reservoir computer based on an opto - electronic architecture . as nonlinear element we exploit the sine nonlinearity of an integrated mach - zehnder intensity modulator ( a well known , off - the - shelf component in the telecommunications industry ) , and to store the internal states of the reservoir computer we use a fiber optics spool .",
    "we report results comparable to state of the art digital implementations for two tasks of practical importance : nonlinear channel equalization and speech recognition .",
    "reservoir computing , which is at the heart of the present work , is a highly successful method for processing time dependent information .",
    "it provides state of the art performance for tasks such as time series prediction @xcite ( and notably won a financial time series prediction competition@xcite ) , nonlinear channel equalization @xcite , or speech recognition @xcite . for some of these tasks",
    "reservoir computing is in fact the most powerful approach known at present .",
    "the central part of a reservoir computer is a nonlinear recurrent dynamical system that is driven by one or multiple input signals .",
    "the key insight behind reservoir computing is that the reservoir s response to the input signal , i.e. , the way the internal variables depend on present and past inputs , is a form of computation .",
    "experience shows that in many cases the computation carried out by reservoirs , even randomly chosen ones , can be extremely powerful .",
    "the reservoir should have a large number of internal ( state ) variables .",
    "the exact structure of the reservoir is not essential : for instance , in some works the reservoir closely mimics the interconnections and dynamics of biological neurons in a brain @xcite , but many other architectures are possible .    to achieve useful computation on time dependent input signals , a good reservoir should be able to compute a large number of different functions of its inputs .",
    "that is , the reservoir should be sufficiently high - dimensional , and its responses should not only depend on present inputs but also on inputs up to some finite time in the past . to achieve this , the reservoir must operate at the threshold of dynamical instability which ensures that the system exhibits a `` fading memory '' , meaning that it will gradually forget previous inputs .",
    "reservoir computing is a versatile and flexible concept .",
    "this follows from two key points : 1 ) many of the details of the nonlinear reservoir itself are unimportant except for the dynamic regime ( threshold of instability ) which can be tuned by some global parameters ; and 2 ) the only part of the system that is trained is a linear output layer . because of this flexibility , reservoir computing is amenable to a large number of experimental implementations",
    ". thus proof of principle demonstrations have been realized in a bucket of water @xcite and using an analog vlsi chip @xcite , and arrays of semiconductor amplifiers have been considered in simulation @xcite .",
    "however , it is only very recently that an analog implementation with performance comparable to digital implementations has been reported : namely , the electronic implementation presented in @xcite .",
    "our experiment is based on a similar architecture as that of @xcite , namely a single non linear node and a delay line .",
    "the main differences are the type of non linearity and the desynchronisation of the input with respect to the period of the delay line .",
    "these differences highlight the flexibility of the concept .",
    "the performance of our experiment on two benchmark tasks , isolated digit recognition and non linear channel equalization , is comparable to state of the art digital implementations of reservoir computing . compared to@xcite ,",
    "our experiment is almost 6 orders of magnitude faster , and a further 2 - 3 orders of magnitude speed increase should be possible with only small changes to the system .",
    "the flexibility of reservoir computing and its success on hard classification tasks makes it a promising route for realizing computation in physical systems other than digital electronics .",
    "in particular it may provide innovative solutions for ultra fast or ultra low power computation . in supplementary material 1",
    "we describe reservoir computing in more detail and provide a road map for building high performance analog reservoir computers . in the discussion",
    "we discuss how to measure the speed of experimental reservoir computers .      understanding how physical systems can process information is a major scientific challenge .",
    "the tremendous progress that has been accomplished during the past century has given rise to whole new fields of science , such as computer science and digital ( silicon ) electronics , or quantum information .",
    "information processing by classical analog systems is a case apart because remarkable examples are found in the biological sciences ( e.g. the brain ) , but our understanding is still very incomplete .",
    "thus , we understand at the basic level many aspects of how information is processed using biochemical reactions in cells , or how information is processed by neurons in a brain , to take two examples . but how these elementary processes are organized at a higher level , and what is the large scale architecture of these systems , still escapes us . understanding these issues would be of great conceptual interest .",
    "it could also have huge technological repercussions , as it could completely change the way we build information processing machines .",
    "that this tremendous scope for progress exists is illustrated by the approximately 6 orders of magnitude gap in energy consumption between a brain and a present day silicon computerwatt . for a presentation of the simulation , see @xcite ] .",
    "so far most work on information processing in analog systems has been based on imitating biological systems .",
    "this has given rise to the field of artificial neural networks .",
    "more abstract approaches have also been developed , such as hidden markov models , or support vector machines .",
    "reservoir computing @xcite provides an alternative line of attack .",
    "the interest of reservoir computing is that 1 ) it proposes architectures that are quite different from those studied up to now ; and 2 ) despite a relatively recent history -the first papers on the topic date from 2002- , its performances are comparable to , and sometimes even exceed , those of other approaches to machine learning .",
    "a deeper understanding of reservoir computing could provide new insights into how analog classical systems , and in particular biological systems , process information .",
    "additionally it could give rise to novel approaches for implementing computation and enable new applications .",
    "the aim of the present text is not to duplicate existing reviews of reservoir computing @xcite .",
    "rather , we wish to present the subject from the point of view of the physicist or engineer who wishes to build an experimental reservoir computer .",
    "we will argue that reservoir computing provides a quite detailed , but also quite flexible , road map towards building physical systems that process information with architectures very different from those used up to now .",
    "before introducing our implementation , we recall a few key features of reservoir computing ; for a more detailed treatment of the underlying theory , we refer the reader to supplementary material 1 .",
    "as is traditional in the literature , we will consider tasks that are defined in discrete time , e.g. , using sampled signals .",
    "we denote by @xmath0 the input signal , where @xmath1@xmath2 is the discretized time ; by @xmath3 the internal states of the system used as reservoir ; and by @xmath4 the output of the reservoir .",
    "a typical evoultion law for @xmath3 is @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a nonlinear function , @xmath7 is the time independent connection matrix and @xmath8 is the time independent input mask .",
    "note that in our work we will use a slightly different form for the evolution law , as explained below .    in order to perform the computation",
    "one needs a readout mechanism . to this end",
    "we define a subset @xmath9 ( also in discrete time ) of the internal states of the reservoir .",
    "it is these states which are observed and used to build the output .",
    "the time dependent output is obtained in an output layer by taking a linear combination of the internal states of the reservoir @xmath10 .",
    "the readout weights @xmath11 are chosen to minimize the mean square error ( mse ) between the estimator @xmath4 and a target function @xmath12 : @xmath13 over a set of examples ( the training set ) . because the mse is a quadratic function of the @xmath11 the optimal weights can be easily computed from the knowledge of @xmath14 and @xmath12 . in a typical run , the quality of the reservoir",
    "is then evaluated on a second set of examples ( the test set ) .",
    "after training , the @xmath11 are kept fixed .      in the present work we use an architecture related to that used in @xcite and to the minimum complexity networks studied in @xcite . as in @xcite ,",
    "the reservoir is based on a non - linear system with delayed feedback ( a class of systems widely studied in the nonlinear dynamics community , see e.g. @xcite ) and consists of a single nonlinear node and a delay loop .",
    "the information about the previous internal state of the reservoir up to some time @xmath15 in the past is stored in the delay loop . after a period @xmath15 of the loop ,",
    "the entire internal state has been updated ( processed ) by the nonlinear node .",
    "in contrast to the work described in @xcite , the nonlinear node in our implementation is essentially instantaneous . hence , in the absence of input , the dynamics of our system can be approximated by the simple recursion @xmath16 where @xmath17 ( the _ feedback gain _ ) and @xmath18 ( the _ bias _ ) are adjustable parameters and we have explicitly written the sine nonlinearity used in our implementation .",
    "we will use this system to perform useful computation on input signals @xmath0 evolving in discrete time @xmath19 as the system itself operates in continuous time , we need to define ways to convert input signal(s ) to continuous time and to convert the system s state back to discrete time .",
    "the first is achieved by using a sample and hold procedure .",
    "we obtain a piecewise constant function @xmath20 of the continuous variable @xmath21 : @xmath22 .",
    "the time @xmath23 is taken to be less than or equal to the period @xmath15 of the delay loop ; when @xmath24 we are in the unsynchronised regime ( see below ) . to discretize the system s state",
    ", we note that the delay line acts as a memory , storing the delayed states of the nonlinearity . from this large - dimensional state space , we take @xmath25 samples by dividing the input period @xmath26 into @xmath25 segments , each of duration @xmath27 and sampling the state of the delay line at a single point with periodicity @xmath27 .",
    "this provides us with @xmath25 _ snapshots _ of the nonlinearity s reponse to each input sample @xmath0 . from these snapshots ,",
    "we construct @xmath25 discrete - time sequences @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) to be used as reservoir states from which the required ( discrete - time ) output is to be constructed .    without further measures ,",
    "all such recorded reservoir states would be identical , so for computational purposes our system is one - dimensional . in order to use this system as a reservoir computer ,",
    "we need to drive it in such a way that the @xmath14 represent a rich variety of functions of the input history .",
    "it is often helpful @xcite to use an `` input mask '' that breaks the symmetry of the system . in @xcite good performance",
    "was improved by using a nonlinear node with an intrinsic time scale longer than the time scale of the input mask . in the present work we also use the `` input mask '' , but as our nonlinearity is instantaneous , we can not exploit its intrinsic time scale .",
    "we instead chose to desynchronize the input and the reservoir , that is , we hold the input for a time @xmath26 which differs slightly from the period @xmath15 of the delay loop .",
    "this allows us to use each reservoir state at time @xmath30 for the generation of a new different state at time @xmath31 ( unlike the solution used in @xcite where the intrinsic time scale of the nonlinear node makes the successive states highly correlated ) .",
    "we now explain these important notions in more detail .",
    "the input mask @xmath32 is a periodic function of period @xmath26 .",
    "it is piecewise constant over intervals of length @xmath27 , i.e. , @xmath33 when @xmath34 , for @xmath35 .",
    "the values @xmath36 of the mask are randomly chosen from some probability distribution .",
    "the reservoir is driven by the product @xmath37 of the input and the mask , with @xmath38 an adjustable parameter ( the _ input gain _ ) .",
    "the dynamics of the driven system can thus be approximated by @xmath39 it follows that the reservoir states can be approximated by @xmath40 when @xmath41 ( the synchronized regime ) or more generally as @xmath42 when @xmath43 , ( @xmath44 ) ( the unsynchronized regime ) . in the synchronized regime ,",
    "the reservoir states correspond to the responses of @xmath25 uncoupled discrete - time dynamical systems which are similar , but slightly different through the randomly chosen @xmath36 . in the unsynchronized regime , with a desynchronization @xmath45 ,",
    "the state equations become coupled , yielding a much richer dynamics . with an instantaneous nonlinearity ,",
    "desynchronisation is necessary to obtain a set of state transformations that is useful for reservoir computing .",
    "we beleive that it will also be useful when the non linearity has an intrinsic time scale , as it provides a very simple way to enrich the dynamics .    in summary , by using an input mask , combined with desynchronization of the input and the feedback delay ,",
    "we have turned a system with a one - dimensional information representation into an n - dimensional system .",
    "the above architecture is implemented in the experiment depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : experimental - set - up . ] .",
    "the sine nonlinearity is implemented by a voltage driven intensity modulator ( lithium niobate mach zehnder interferometer ) , placed at the output of a continuous light source , and the delay loop is a fiber spool .",
    "a photodiode converts the light intensity @xmath46 at the output of the fiber spool into a voltage ; this is mixed with an input voltage generated by a function generator and proportional to @xmath47 , amplified , and then used to drive the intensity modulator .",
    "the feedback gain @xmath17 is set by adjusting the average intensity @xmath48 of the light inside the fiber loop with an optical attenuator . by changing @xmath17",
    "we can bring the system to the edge of dynamical instability .",
    "the nonlinear dynamics of this system have already been extensively studied , see @xcite .",
    "the dynamical variable @xmath49 is obtained by rescaling the light intensity to lie in the interval @xmath50 $ ] through @xmath51 .",
    "then , neglecting the effect of the bandpass filter induced by the electronic amplifiers , the dynamics of the system is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : dynamics ] ) where @xmath17 is proportional to @xmath48 . equation ( [ eq : dynamics ] ) , as well as the discretized versions thereof , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : discretedynamics ] ) and ( [ eq : discreteunsynchronizeddynamics ] ) , are derived in the supplementary material ; the various stages of processing of the reservoir nodes and inputs are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram ] .    in our experiment",
    "the round trip time is @xmath52s and we typically use @xmath53 internal nodes . the parameters @xmath17 and @xmath38 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dynamics ] ) are adjusted for optimal performance ( their optimal value may depend on the task ) , while @xmath18 is usually set to 0 .",
    "the intensity @xmath46 is recorded by a digitizer , and the estimator @xmath4 is reconstructed offline on a computer .",
    "we illustrate the operations of our reservoir computer in fig.[fig : signalclass ] where we consider a very simple signal recognition task . here , the input to the system is taken to be a random concatenation of sine and square waves ; the target function @xmath12 is @xmath54 for a sine wave and @xmath55 for a square wave .",
    "the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : signalclass ] shows the input to the reservoir : the blue line is the representation of the input in continuous time @xmath20 . in the bottom panel , the output of the network after training",
    "is shown with red crosses , against the desired output represented by a blue line .",
    "the performance on this task is essentially perfect : the normalized mean square error @xmath56 reaches @xmath57 , which is significantly better than the results reported using simulations in @xcite .",
    "we have checked the performance of this system extensively in simulations .",
    "first of all , if we neglect the effects of the bandpass filters , and neglect all noise introduced in our experiment , we obtain a discretized system described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : discreteunsynchronizeddynamics ] ) which is similar to ( but nevertheless distinct from ) the minimum complexity reservoirs introduced in @xcite .",
    "we have checked that this discretized version of our system has performance similar to usual reservoirs on several tasks .",
    "this shows that the chosen architecture is capable of state of the art reservoir computing , and sets for our experimental system a performance goal .",
    "secondly we have also developed a simulation code that takes into account all the noises of the experimental components , as well as the effects of the bandpass filters .",
    "these simulations are in very good agreement with the experimentally measured dynamics of the system .",
    "they allow us to efficiently explore the experimental parameter space , and to validate the experimental results .",
    "further details on these two simulation models are given in the supplementary information .",
    "we apply our optoelectronic reservoir to three tasks .",
    "these tasks are benchmarks which have been widely used in the reservoir computing community to evaluate the performance of reservoirs .",
    "they therefore allow comparison between our experiment and state of the art digital implementations of reservoir computing .",
    "for the first task , we train our reservoir computer to behave like a nonlinear auto regressive moving average equation of order 10 , driven by white noise ( narma10 ) . more precisely ,",
    "given the white noise @xmath0 , the reservoir should produce an output @xmath4 which should be as close as possible to the response @xmath12 of the narma10 model to the same white noise .",
    "the task is described in detail in the methods section .",
    "the performance is measured by the normalised mean square error ( nmse ) between output @xmath4 and target @xmath12 . for a network of 50 nodes ,",
    "both in simulations and experiment , we obtain a @xmath58 .",
    "this is similar to the value obtained using digital reservoirs of the same size .",
    "for instance a nmse value of @xmath59 is reported in @xcite also for a reservoir of size 50 .    for our second task",
    "we consider a problem of practical relevance : the equalization of a nonlinear channel .",
    "we consider a model of a wireless communication channel in which the input signal @xmath60 travels through multiple paths to a nonlinear and noisy receiver .",
    "the task is to reconstruct the input @xmath60 from the output @xmath0 of the receiver .",
    "the model we use was introduced in @xcite and studied in the context of reservoir computing in @xcite .",
    "our results , given in fig . [ fig : channelequalization ] , are one order of magnitude better than those obtained in @xcite with a nonlinear adaptive filter , and comparable to those obtained in @xcite with a digital reservoir . at 28 db of signal to noise ratio ,",
    "for example , we obtain an error rate of @xmath61 , while the best error rate obtained in @xcite is @xmath62 and in @xcite error rates between @xmath63 and @xmath64 are reported .",
    "finally we apply our reservoir to isolated spoken digits recognition using a benchmark task introduced in the reservoir computing community in @xcite . the performance on this task",
    "is measured using the word error rate ( wer ) which gives the percentage of words that are wrongly classified .",
    "performances reported in the literature are a wer of @xmath65 using a hidden markov model @xcite ; wers of @xmath66 @xcite , of @xmath67 @xcite , of @xmath68 @xcite for reservoir computers of different sizes and with different post processing of the output . the experimental reservoir presented in @xcite reported a wer of @xmath67 .",
    "our experiment yields a wer of @xmath69 , using a reservoir of @xmath70 nodes .",
    "further details on these tasks are given in the methods section and in supplementary material 2 .",
    "we have reported the first demonstration of an opto - electronic reservoir computer .",
    "our experiment has performance comparable to state of the art digital implementations on benchmark tasks of practical relevance such as speech recognition and channel equalization . our work demonstrates the flexibility of reservoir computers that can be readily reprogrammed for different tasks .",
    "indeed by re - optimising the output layer ( that is , choosing new readout weights @xmath71 ) , and by readjusting the operating point of the reservoir ( changing the feedback gain @xmath17 , the input gain @xmath38 , and possibly the bias @xmath18 ) one can use the same reservoir for many different tasks . using this procedure ,",
    "our experimental reservoir computer has been used successively for tasks such as signal classification , modeling a dynamical system ( narma10 task ) , speech recognition , and nonlinear channel equalization .",
    "we have introduced a new feature in the architecture , as compared to the related experiment reported in @xcite .",
    "namely by desynchronizing the input with respect to the period of the reservoir we conserve the necessary coupling between the internal states , but make a more efficient use of the internal states as the correlations introduced by the low pass filter in @xcite are not necessary .",
    "our experiment is also the first implementation of reservoir computing fast enough for real time information processing .",
    "it can be converted into a high speed reservoir computer simply by increasing the bandwidth of all the components ( an increase of at least 2 orders of magnitude is possible with off - the - shelf optoelectronic components ) .",
    "we note that in future realisations it will be necessary to have an analog implementation of the pre - processing of the input ( digitisation and multiplication by the input mask ) and of the post - processing of the output ( multiplication by output weights ) , rather than the digital pre- and post - processing used in the present work .    from the point of view of applications ,",
    "the present work thus constitutes an important step towards building ultra high speed optical reservoir computers . to help achieve this goal , in the supplementary material we present guidelines for building experimental reservoir computers .",
    "whether optical implementations can eventually compete with electronic implementations is an open question . from the fundamental point of view",

    "the aim of reservoir computing is to perform a computation on the input @xmath0 . to this end one",
    "maps the internal state of the reservoir to an output signal denoted @xmath4 .",
    "the output should be as close as possible to a given target function @xmath12 .",

    "another example would be trying to predict future inputs such as electrical load prediction or financial time - series prediction .",
    "the output @xmath4 of the reservoir computer at time @xmath30 is a linear combination of the high dimensional internal states of the reservoir at time @xmath30 : @xmath105 the @xmath11 are usuallly chosen as follows . for some time interval , @xmath106 $ ] we simulate the reservoir such that one knows both the inputs @xmath0 and the target function @xmath12 .",

    "note that in general one should apply some form of regularization ( to reduce the model complexity ) to the readout function eq .",
    "( [ eq : output ] ) . to this end",
    "one uses optimisation techniques that prefer models with small parameters @xmath11 .",
    "this is accomplished by using e.g. ridge regression .",
    "the coefficients @xmath11 are now fixed and the reservoir computer is ready for use : one can input into the reservoir new inputs @xmath0 and obtain the corresponding output @xmath4 . because of the training procedure where we ensured proper generalization , the output will continue to be close to the target function , even for new data .",

    "estimates the performance of the reservoir in a test phase during which new inputs are fed into the reservoir , and one compares , using the previously chosen @xmath11 and an appropriate error metric , how close the output is to the target function .",
    "several remarks are now in order :    1 .   for good performance ,",
    "it is necessary to scale the coefficients by a multiplicative factor @xmath108 ( in other words , if the coefficients are drawn from normal distributions with mean zero , one adjusts the variances of the normals ) .",
    "these parameters are often called the feedback gain and input gain respectively . the necessity for this scaling",
    "can be understood intuitively as follows : if the coefficients @xmath100 are too small , then the state equation ( [ eq : restanh ] ) is strongly damped ; if the coefficients @xmath100 are too large , then the system has highly complex dynamics or is even chaotic , and its behavior is very sensitive to small changes in the input .",
    "the coefficients @xmath101 are adjusted in order to have an appropriate ratio between the contribution of the terms @xmath109 and the source term @xmath110 .",
    "they also determine how non - linearly the inputs are expanded in the reservoir states .",
    "2 .   finding the optimal values of @xmath11 is immediate in the case of linear regression . indeed inserting eq .",
    "( [ eq : output ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq : mse ] ) and extremizing with respect to @xmath11 , one finds that the optimal choice is @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the inverse of the correlation matrix @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "this should be contrasted to what would happen if one tried to optimize the coefficients @xmath100 and @xmath101 . in this case",
    "there are many more coefficients to optimize , and furthermore it is difficult to find the optimal value , as one may very easily end up in local optima . the use of a linear readout eq .",
    "( [ eq : output ] ) is thus highly advantageous .",
    "many variants on the above architecture have been investigated with success .",
    "we can list : 1 .",
    "using other nonlinearities than @xmath104 , such as the biological inspired models which approximate the way real neurons interact with each other ( spiking neuron models ) .",
    "2 .   using sparse connection matrices @xmath100 ( i.e. matrices with most of the elements set to zero ) , so as to decrease the computational resources required to simulate the evolution .",
    "3 .   using multiple inputs @xmath115 , @xmath116 . in this case",
    "one simply adds an index to the coefficients @xmath101 . the source term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : restanh ] ) thus becomes @xmath117 .",
    "4 .   using the output @xmath4 as input to the reservoir .",
    "this modification allows training the reservoir to behave as a given dynamical system @xcite.[enu : using - the - output ] 4 .",
    "the above approach is extremely powerful . to take two examples : 1",
    "given a time series @xmath0 for times @xmath118 , the task is to guess the subsequent values of the time series @xmath119 the time series could for instance come from the evolution of a chaotic dynamical system , such as the mackey - glass system . using the trick [ enu : using - the - output ] , results which outperform all other known approaches for predicting chaotic time series were obtained @xcite .",
    "reservoir computing also won an international competition on prediction of future evolution of financial time series @xcite .",
    "reservoir computing has been extensively applied to speech recognition . using well known data sets",
    ", reservoir computing outperforms other approaches for isolated digit recognition @xcite .",
    "recently reservoir computing has been applied to a more complex task : phoneme recognition .",
    "performances comparable to the best alternative methods were obtained using 3 coupled reservoirs , each with @xmath120 variables @xcite .",
    "the basic setup of reservoir computing , although typically implemented in software , suggests many promising new avenues to implement computation in analog dynamic systems . the theoretical requirements for reservoir computing to be computationally universal ( in the analog sense )",
    "@xcite are very loose : the reservoir is required to have fading memory , to be excitable by the input and a high dimensional readout must be possible .",
    "many physical systems could be conceived that adhere to these rules and could thus potentially be turned in universal computing machines . however turning these general ideas into a working machine in more difficult .",
    "if one wishes to build an experimental reservoir computer , then it is essential to understand what are the constraints , but also the design freedom . in this respect",
    ", a number of important lessons can be learned from the example presented in the previous section .    1 .",
    "the fact that the interconnection matrix @xmath100 and the coefficients @xmath101 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : restanh ] ) are chosen at random is extremely important .",
    "it means that fine tuning of a large number of coefficients is not necessary for a good reservoir computer .",
    "rather almost all interconnection matrices will give good performance .",
    "2 .   the fact that the tanh in eq .",
    "( [ eq : restanh ] ) can be changed into other non - linearities is also extremely important .",
    "it means that one does not have to imitate specific non - linear behavior ( such as the specific dynamics of neurons in a biological brain ) , but one can use the non - linearities that are easily accessible experimentally .",
    "3 .   the fact that the only coefficients that are task specific are the @xmath11 ( the weights of the readout function ) implies that a given dynamical system can be used for many different information processing tasks .",
    "it also implies that one can separate the design and analysis of the reservoir itself from the design and analysis of the readout function .    on the basis of these remarks ,",
    "a reservoir computer can be built out of a dynamical system that satisfies the following constraints :    1 .",
    "it should consist of a large number ( say 50 , or more , but this depends on the task and on the specifics of the dynamic system ) dynamical variables which are coupled together by a non - linear evolution equation .",
    "the evolution of the dynamical system can be perturbed by the external input .",
    "3 .   as much as possible , one should try to break all symmetries of the system ( this is the message coming from the fact that the @xmath100 and @xmath101 are random : there is no residual structure / symmetry in the dynamics ) . to this end",
    "one should privilege dynamical systems that depend on a large number of random parameters .",
    "a few global parameters must be experimentally tunable .",
    "these global parameters are used to adjust the operating point of the system ( typically to just below the threshold of instability ) , and to adjust the overall weight given to the external inputs ( this corresponds to the scaling of the coefficients @xmath100 and @xmath101 ) .",
    "it should be possible to read - out the state of a large number ( better all ) of the dynamical variables , or at least to construct the readout function @xmath121 with adjustable weights @xmath11 .",
    "note that a reservoir computer can function satisfactorily even if only a subset of the dynamical variables are read out .",
    "once these constraints are satisfied , one can proceed to test the system ( either using numerical simulations , or using the experimental realization ) . in the reservoir computing literature ,",
    "there exists a series of ( somewhat ) standardized tests on which to evaluate the performance of the system .",
    "some of these tests have a theoretical justification ( e.g. linear memory capacity ) ; others are interesting tasks which have been often used by the community .",
    "these tasks thus provide benchmarks with which to compare the performances of different reservoir computers .",
    "possible tasks to study include :    1 .",
    "linear memory capacity and memory function @xcite . in this task",
    "the target function @xmath122 is simply the input @xmath89 time steps in the past .",
    "performance on this task indicates how well the reservoir s state can be used to recover past inputs .",
    "if the linear memory capacity is small , then the reservoir will be unable to carry out tasks that require long memory of the input .",
    "non - linear memory capacity , see @xcite . in this task",
    "the target function is a non - linear function of the past inputs , for instance the product @xmath123 .",
    "performance on this task measures how much non - linear processing of the input is carried out by the reservoir .",
    "3 .   simulating specific nonlinear auto regressive moving average ( narma ) systems .",
    "for the narma tasks , the aim is to use the reservoir to simulat the response of a narma system driven by a random input .",
    "two variants are widely used : a 10th order system ( narma10 ) introduced in @xcite , and the more difficult 30th order system ( narma30 ) ( see for instance @xcite for a definition ) .",
    "4 .   predicting the evolution of the trajectory of chaotic attractors such as the attractor of the mackey - glass system @xcite .",
    "speech recognition : several benchmarks have been published , going from japanese vowel recognition @xcite , to isolated spoken digits @xcite , to phoneme recognition @xcite .    this ( non - exhaustive ) list of benchmarks provides a natural road - map for future experimental reservoirs .",
    "first master easy tasks such as signal classification , or isolated digit recognition . then go on to moderately harder tasks such as narma10 or narma30 .",
    "finally , one can imagine tackling hard tasks such as phoneme recognition .",
    "in all cases , measure the linear and nonlinear memory functions , as they will give task independent information on how the reservoir is processing information .",
    "this road - map is appealing .",
    "steps along it have been followed using reservoirs based on water waves in a bucket @xcite , on the cerebral cortex of a cat @xcite , on analog vlsi chips @xcite , using a ( numerically simulated ) array of coupled semi - conductor optical amplifiers @xcite .",
    "however it is only very recently that it has been possible , using an electronics implementation and a delayed feedback loop , to demonstrate an analog reservoir computer with performance comparable to that of digital reservoirs on a non trivial task ( in this case isolated digit recognition ) @xcite .",
    "the above road map leaves open a number of important questions .",
    "we outline the most obvious :    1 .   effect of noise . in experimental realizations of reservoir computing",
    ", there will inevitably be noise and imperfections .",
    "how will these affect the performance of the scheme",
    "? there has not been an exhaustive analysis of this issue , but a few remarks are in order .",
    "one should distinguish between noise within the reservoir itself and noise in the readout .",
    "1 .   noise in the reservoir itself is deleterious .",
    "however , _ _ reservoir computers can continue to work even with moderate levels of noise .",
    "indeed the noise can be viewed as an unwanted input , and the aim is to perform the desired task while ignoring this second unwanted input . a possible approach to counteract the effect of noise",
    "would simply be to increase the size of the reservoir .",
    "but this remains to be studied in detail .",
    "2 .   noise in the readout can be beneficial . indeed adding noise to the readout is a trick , equivalent to ridge regularization , often used in numerical simulations to increase the robustness of reservoirs .",
    "best non - linearity .",
    "experience with digital simulations of reservoirs shows that sigmoidal non - linearities , such as @xmath104 , give very good performance .",
    "however in experimental realizations , other non - linearities may be much easier to implement .",
    "experience suggests that the best non - linearity depends to some extent on the task at hand .",
    "also sub - optimal non - linearities can presumably be compensated by increasing the size of the reservoir .",
    "3 .   continuous time and continuous space . in numerical simulations , it is by far easier to work with a discrete set of variables @xmath14 , @xmath124 evolving in discrete time @xmath98 .",
    "but in experimental systems , it is often much more natural to work with continuous variables and continuous time .",
    "a theory of reservoir computing operating with continuous variables evolving in continuous time remains to be written , although some theoretical progress has been made along these lines @xcite .    finally , what is the future of experimental reservoir computing ?",
    "on the one hand the quest is fundamental : can we build analog systems that perform high - level information processing ?",
    "will we in this way gain new insights into how biological information processing systems operate ?",
    "on the other hand experimental reservoir computers could ultimately have practical applications .",
    "indeed they are based on architectures completely different from those used in present day digital electronics .",
    "presumably the place to look for applications is at the frontier where digital electronics has difficulty coping , such as information processing at ultra high speeds , or with ultra low energy consumption , or for tasks which are hard to code using standard programming methods .",
    "here we describe in more detail our experimental system ( schematized in fig . 1 of the main text )",
    ", the algorithm used to simulate it numerically , and the tasks we study to validate its performance as a reservoir .",
    "we first consider the free running dynamics of our system , in the absence of input .",
    "the light source consists of a laser at the wavelength 1564 nm ( in the standard c band of optical telecommunication ) .",
    "it produces a time independent intensity @xmath48 .",
    "the light passes through an intensity modulator ( mach - zehnder modulator ) driven by a time dependent voltage @xmath125 .",
    "the light intensity just after the modulator is @xmath126 where @xmath127 is a constant voltage ( the voltage which is needed to go from a maximum to the next minimum of light at the output of the modulator ) and @xmath128 can be adjusted by applying a dc bias voltage to the modulator .",
    "taking @xmath129 allows us to rewrite    @xmath130    the light passes trough a tunable optical attenuator , enabling the adjustment of the loop s gain through the variation of the value @xmath48 .",
    "it propagates through a long spool of fiber ( 1.7 km of single mode optical fiber in our experiment ) , and is then detected by a photodiode integrated with a transimpedance amplifier .",
    "the resulting voltage is amplified again ( by a rf amplifier ) to produce the voltage @xmath125 that drives the intensity modulator . in our experiment ,",
    "the photodiode ( with its transimpedance amplifier ) and rf amplifier operate in a linear regime , hence @xmath125 is proportional to @xmath131 where @xmath15 is the round trip time of the oscillator .",
    "however , one must take into account that the photodiode acts as a lowpass filter and that the rf amplifiers act as highpass filters .",
    "both the photodiode and the amplifiers also add noise .",
    "thus , approximating the filters by first order filters , we have @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the imaginary unit , tilde denotes the fourier transform , @xmath134 denotes the amplification factor , @xmath135 are the cutoff frequencies of the resulting bandpass filter , and @xmath30(t ) is the white noise . in the time domain",
    "we have @xmath136 where @xmath137 denotes the linear bandpass filter .",
    "because of the high pass filter , we can use as variable the fluctuations around the mean intensity .",
    "we define @xmath138 ( i.e. , we rescale the intensity i(t ) to lie in the interval @xmath50 $ ] ) whereupon eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) becomes @xmath139 where @xmath140 is experimentally adjustable by changing the input light intensity @xmath48 .",
    "experimentally it can be tuned over the range @xmath141 $ ] .",
    "typical values of the parameters are @xmath142s , @xmath143mhz , @xmath144khz , and the amplitude of @xmath145 is approximately @xmath146% . at the output of the intensity modulator ,",
    "an optical splitter enables us to take approximatively 3% of the optical signal in order to measure the optical intensity in the fiber by the mean of a second amplified photodiode .",
    "the resulting voltage is digitized with a national instrument pxi card at the sample rate of 200 megasamples per second , or can be measured with a digital oscilloscope .",
    "if we increase @xmath48 gradually , the intensity @xmath147 undergoes a bifurcation diagram typical of nonlinear dynamical systems .",
    "figure [ fig : bifurcationdiagram ] shows the excellent agreement between the experimentally observed bifurcation diagram and the one obtained by numerical simulations of the evolution equations ( with the bias @xmath148 ) . in this bifurcation diagram , the number of bifurcations before reaching chaotic behavior is strongly affected by the amount of noise in the system . comparing this bifurcation diagram to simulations is the most precise way we have to estimate the amount of noise in our experimental setup .",
    "the estimated value is in agreement with measurements carried out on each component of the setup separately .",
    "we also verified that the thickness of the branches inside the bifurcation diagram is mainly due to the noise level of oscilloscope .",
    "we now consider the addition of an input term .",
    "the input is characterized by a new time scale @xmath23 . the scalar input @xmath149 ( evolving in discrete time @xmath150 and the input mask @xmath101",
    "are transformed into a continuous input @xmath151 as follows : @xmath152,\\quad i=0,\\ldots , n-1\\quad,\\quad n\\in\\mathbb{z}\\label{eq : source}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the number of nodes in the reservoir .",
    "the input mask values @xmath101 , @xmath124 are randomly chosen from a given distribution ( which may depend on the task ) .",
    "the time scale @xmath27 over which the input @xmath151 changes is : @xmath153    a voltage proportional to @xmath151 is generated by a function generator ( at a sample rate of 200 msamples / s ) and added to the output voltage of the amplified photodiode using a rf combiner placed at the entrance of the rf amplifier .",
    "so the voltage @xmath125 that drives the intensity modulator is a combination of the light intensity and the input signal .",
    "the dynamical equations thus become    @xmath154    where @xmath38 is experimentally adjustable by varying the output voltage amplitude of the function generator . in this equation , we take into account that the rf combiner is placed before the rf amplifier , and therefore that the source term is affected by the highpass filter @xmath155 of the rf amplifier . because of the difference between the time scales @xmath15 and @xmath156 , the effect of the filter @xmath155 is almost negligible .",
    "its main effect is to ensure that the effective source signal @xmath157 has mean value zero .    in our experiments",
    "we take @xmath158 .",
    "the number @xmath25 of variables is taken in the range @xmath159 .",
    "we take @xmath160 ( see figure [ fig : inputoutputand discretization ] ) .",
    "thus for @xmath161 we have @xmath162 .",
    "the performance of the reservoir does not depend on the exact value of @xmath26 chosen , as long as @xmath163 is not a simple fraction ( such as 1 , 3/4 , or 1/2 ) , which would divide our reservoir into different independent subsystems .",
    "to obtain the discretized dynamics , we discretise the intensity along the fiber according to @xmath164 where we suppose that @xmath165 with @xmath89 integer ( see figure [ fig : inputoutputand discretization ] ) .",
    "we thus have that the physical time @xmath21 is related to @xmath166 through @xmath167 upon neglecting the effects of the filters @xmath168 and @xmath155 we obtain the discretized version of eq .",
    "( [ eq : xsinxsource ] ) .",
    "note that the absence of synchronisation ( @xmath24 , or equivalently @xmath169 ) completely modifies the dynamics by coupling the discretised variables @xmath170 to each other .",
    "note also that the wrap arround effect ( the second line in eq .",
    "( [ eq : discreteunsynchronizeddynamics ] ) ) does not appear in traditional reservoir computing .",
    "two different numerical models were developed to study the capabilities of the network : a discretized model , closer to the standard formulation of echo state networks , and a continuous model , which is as close as possible to our experimental apparatus .    in the discretized version of the model we implement the discretization described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : discreteunsynchronizeddynamics ] ) .",
    "no noise is considered , and the bandpass effects of the various components are neglected .",
    "the sine nonlinearity and the topology of the network are preserved .",
    "the optimal operating point of the system is found by tuning the parameters @xmath17 and @xmath38 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : discreteunsynchronizeddynamics ] ) .",
    "this model is used to set a performance goal for our experimental system : if the performance of the experiment is close to the one of the model , then our system is robust enough with respect to the noise and the effects introduced by each of its components . moreover , the performance of the discretized model is the same , within the experimental error , to the one of traditional networks as reported in @xcite , allowing us to validate the chosen nonlinearity and topology as good choices for a reservoir computer .",
    "the continuous matlab model we developed is instead as close as possible to the experiment .",
    "all the signals in the simulation are discretized at 200 msamples / s .",
    "this corresponds to the sample rate of the arbitrary waveform generator and the digitizer .",
    "all the components are represented by their transfer function at their respective operating point ( sine function for the mach - zehnder modulator , responsivity and transimpedance gains of the photodiodes , gain of the amplifier ) .",
    "the collective frequency response of all the components is represented by a bandpass filter with first order slopes .",
    "this is a reasonable approximation to the exact slope of the bandpass filters which was measured using a vector network analyzer in open loop configuration .",
    "noise is added to the signal at each noisy element of the system ( dark current of the photodiode , noise added by each amplifier ... ) .",
    "the dynamics of the model correspond very closely to the experiment .",
    "this is illustrated for instance by the clear agreement of the simulated and measured bifurcation diagram ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : bifurcationdiagram ] ) and by the clear agreement of the simulated and measured performances on the channel equalization task , see fig .",
    "[ fig : channelequalization ] in the main text .",
    "the continuous model allows us to easily explore the sensitivity to parameters , such as noise level or the shape of the nonlinearity , which ca nt always be reached with the experiment .",
    "the light intensity @xmath46 in the fiber loop is converted to a voltage by a photodiode and recorded by the digitizer operating at 200ms / s . from the intensity @xmath46 recorded during a time @xmath26",
    "we extract @xmath25 discrete variable values @xmath14 , @xmath124 .",
    "this is carried out as follows .",
    "the intensity @xmath46 is divided into @xmath25 pieces of duration @xmath27 .",
    "we neglect the first quarter and the last quarter of the data points recorded over the duration @xmath27 and associate to @xmath14 the average of the remaining data points .",
    "this procedure in which the beginning and end of each interval @xmath27 is omitted allows us to not be affected by the transients as the intensity goes from one value to the other , and also allows an efficient synchronization of our system .",

    "this post processing is carried out offline , on a computer .",
    "[ fig : inputoutputand discretization ] shows an example of the input sent to the reservoir , the reservoir response and the discretization operated on the reservoir output .",
    "in our work we considered several tasks . we review them in detail .",
    "this is a simple task that we use for a first evaluation of the performance of the reservoir .",
    "the input @xmath0 to the system consists of random sequences of sine and square waves discretized into @xmath172 points per period .",

    "the weights @xmath11 are obtained by minimizing the mse between @xmath4 and the ideal output .",
    "experimentally we obtain @xmath96 , which corresponds to essentially perfect operation for this task .",

    "we then obtain an estimator @xmath177 by replacing @xmath4 by the discretized value @xmath178 to which it is closest .",
    "finally we estimate the symbol error rate ( ser ) , i.e. , the fraction of time that @xmath177 differs from @xmath60 .",
    "the performance of the network is calculated as the average performance over 10 different input sequences , in which the first 3000 samples form the training set and the following 6000 samples form the test set .",
    "the ser on the test set is then studied as a function of signal to noise ratio at the input .",
