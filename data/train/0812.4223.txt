    "the large hadron collider ( lhc ) will soon test the mechanism of spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "it is widely agreed that this phenomenon is associated to the expectation value of a scalar field which transforms as a doublet with respect to the weak su(2)-symmetry .",
    "the origin and status of this order parameter wait , however , for experimental clarification .",
    "in particular , an effective description in terms of a scalar field does not tell us if this scalar is  fundamental \" in the sense that it constitutes a dynamical degree of freedom in a microscopic theory which is formulated at momentum scales much larger than the fermi scale .",
    "alternatively , no fundamental higgs scalar may be present , and the order parameter rather involves an effective  composite field \" . in this note",
    "we investigate the second possibility and therefore consider the fermions of the standard model without a fundamental higgs scalar .    as long as we include only the gauge interactions of the standard model , the microscopic or classical action of such a theory does not involve any mass scale .",
    "an effective mass scale @xmath2 will only be generated by the running of the strong gauge coupling , which is asymptotically free @xcite .",
    "confinement removes then the gluons and quarks from the massless spectrum .",
    "in addition , the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking by quark - antiquark condensates would also imply electroweak symmerty breaking by a composite order parameter , in this case the chiral condensate . in this",
    "setting all particle masses would be of the order @xmath2 or zero , such that this scenario can not explain why the top quark mass or the @xmath3,@xmath4-boson masses are much larger than 1gev .",
    "furthermore , all leptons would remain massless .",
    "one concludes that any realistic model needs further interactions beyond the standard model gauge interactions .",
    "since the strong and electroweak gauge couplings remain actually quite small at the fermi scale of electroweak symmetry breaking , they are expected to produce only some quantitative corrections to the dominant mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "we will therefore neglect the gauge couplings in this paper .",
    "our knowledge about the effective interactions between the quarks and leptons at some microscopic or ",
    "ultraviolet \" scale @xmath5 is very limited .",
    "furthermore , it is not known which scale @xmath5 has to be taken .",
    "typically , one may associate @xmath5 with the scale where further unification takes place , as a grand unified scale or the planck scale for the unification with gravity .",
    "this would suggest a very high scale , @xmath6 gev and we will have this scenario in mind for our discussion . however , much smaller values of @xmath5 are also possible . in practice",
    ", we will only assume here that @xmath5 is sufficiently above the fermi scale ( say @xmath7 tev ) , such that an effective description involving only the fermions of the standard model becomes possible in the momentum range @xmath8 .",
    "we will formulate our model in terms of effective fermion interactions at the scale @xmath5 and restrict the discussion to a four - fermion interaction involving only the right - handed top quark and the left - handed top and bottom quarks .",
    "this is motivated by the observation that only the top quark has a mass comparable to the fermi scale .",
    "interactions with the other quarks and leptons are assumed to be much smaller than the top quark interactions - typically their relative suppression is reflected in the much smaller masses of the other fermions .",
    "for the discussion in this paper we omit all  light \" fermions and the gauge bosons .    since we do not know the effective degrees of freedom at the scale @xmath5 , the effective interaction is not necessarily local .",
    "non - localities involving inverse powers of the exchanged momenta are typically generated by the propagators of exchanged massless particles . with the inclusion of possibly non - local interactions the limitation to an effective four - fermion interaction",
    "poses no severe restriction .",
    "many models with additional degrees of freedom can be effectively described in this way .",
    "local four - fermion interactions have already been investigated earlier , for example in the models of  top quark condensation \" @xcite . by simple dimensional analysis",
    "a local interaction involves a coupling @xmath9(mass)@xmath10 .",
    "such models therefore exhibit an explicit mass scale in the microscopic action .",
    "it is indeed possible to obtain spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking in this way - the prototype is the nambu - jona - lasinio model @xcite . without a tuning of parameters",
    "the top quark mass @xmath11 turns out , however , to be of the same order as @xmath5 , in contradiction to the assumed separation of scales . by a tuning of parameters it is possible to obtain @xmath12 , but",
    "the issue is now similar to the  gauge hierarchy problem \" in presence of a fundamental scalar field . in order to obtain @xmath12",
    "the microscopic effective action must be close to an ultraviolet fixed point .",
    "the necessity of tuning arises from a  relevant parameter \" in the vicinity of the fixed point ( in the sense of statistical physics for critical phenomena ) which has a dimension not much smaller than one .",
    "a rather extensive search for possible ultraviolet fixed points for pointlike four - fermion interactions has been performed in @xcite .",
    "many fixed points have been found , but all show a relevant direction with substantial dimension , and therefore the need for a parameter tuning for @xmath12",
    ".    we will therefore concentrate in this paper on non - local effective interactions . for such interactions",
    "the coupling @xmath13 is replaced by @xmath14 , with @xmath15 the square of some appropriate exchanged momentum and @xmath0 a dimensionless coupling .",
    "interactions of this type do not involve a mass scale on the level of the microscopic action - the classical action exhibits dilatation symmetry .",
    "still , the quantum fluctuations typically induce an anomaly for the scale symmetry , associated to the running of the dimensionless coupling @xmath0",
    ". this may be responsible for the generation of the fermi scale , in analogy to the  confinement scale \" @xmath2 for qcd .",
    "since the running of dimensionless couplings is only logarithmic , this offers a chance for a large natural hierarchy @xmath16 , without tuning of parameters .",
    "we will present a model of this type .",
    "let us first discuss the possible tensor structures for a non - local four - fermion interaction @xmath17 .",
    "the basic building block is a color singlet fermion bilinear @xmath18 , where the color indices are contracted . the tensor structure with respect to the lorentz symmetry",
    "is determined by @xmath19 such that @xmath18 is a scalar or pseudoscalar , a vector or pseudovector , or a second rank antisymmetric tensor .",
    "interactions in the vector or pseudovector channels involve bilinears with two left - handed or two right - handed fermions , @xmath20 or @xmath21 .",
    "they conserve chiral flavour symmetries which act separately on @xmath22 and @xmath23 and therefore forbid mass terms for the fermions @xmath24 .",
    "interactions capable of producing masses for the top quark and w / z - bosons of comparable magnitude must therefore involve the ( pseudo)scalar or tensor channels . a non - local scalar interaction @xmath25 , with @xmath15",
    "the squared momentum in the scalar exchange channel , has very similar properties as a model with a fundamental higgs scalar which is massless at the scale @xmath5 .",
    "we therefore expect the usual necessity of parameter tuning if we want to achieve a small ratio @xmath26 .",
    "a local coupling @xmath27 is allowed by the symmetries and will be generated by quantum fluctuations .",
    "the interesting remaining candidate is a tensor interaction , with @xmath28 $ ] . for chiral tensors no local interaction in this channel",
    "is consistent with the su(3)@xmath29su(2)@xmath29u(1 ) symmetries of the standard model as well as lorentz symmetry .",
    "we will therefore investigate a model with a non - local interaction of this type .",
    "we define the microscopic or classical action for a lorentz invariant theory of massless interacting fermions by @xmath30 , defined in momentum space as @xmath31 and @xmath32 \\ ;         \\left [ \\bar{t}(p')\\sigma_-^l t(p'+q)\\right ] \\\\",

    "violate the chiral symmetry that would protect the top quark from acquiring a mass .",
    "the matrices @xmath50 correspond to appropriate projections of the commutator @xmath51 $ ] on left ( right ) handed spinors , such that eq .",
    "( [ a2 ] ) indeed describes a tensor exchange interaction ( cf . the appendix a ) .",
    "the lorentz - invariance of the interaction can be checked explicitly .",
    "furthermore , the action ( [ a1 ] ) , ( [ a2 ] ) has a global su(2)@xmath29u(1 ) symmetry - the remnant of the electroweak gauge symmetry in the limit of neglected gauge couplings .",
    "this symmetry forbids mass terms for the quarks , such that a mass term can be generated only by spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "similarly , the interaction is invariant under the color symmetry su(3 ) , with implicitly summed color indices in the bilinears .",
    "we note that only the left - handed bottom quarks are involved in the interaction and we will therefore omit the right - handed bottom quark together with the other light quarks and the leptons .",
    "similar to the photon - exchange description of the non - local coulomb interaction we may obtain @xmath52 from the exchange of chiral tensor fields @xcite , according to the feynman diagrams in fig .  1 .",
    "the lorentz symmetry of @xmath52 becomes more apparent in this formulation .",
    "a summary of the properties of the associated tensor fields and a proof of equivalence of a local theory with massless chiral tensor fields with our non - local fermion interaction ( [ a2 ] ) is provided in appendix a. in this paper we will not use tensor fields and concentrate on the purely fermionic action ( [ a1 ] ) , ( [ a2 ] ) .",
