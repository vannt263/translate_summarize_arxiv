    "in the famous 1966 paper @xcite v. arnold described the dynamics of an ideal fluid as a geodesic flow on the group of volume - preserving diffeomorphisms of a fixed domain equipped with the metric defined by the kinetic energy .",
    "he also showed how sectional curvature of this group enters the problem of lagrangian stability of eulerian fluid motions . in this paper",
    "we are concerned with the exterior geometry of the group of volume - preserving diffeomorphisms considered as an infinite - dimensional submanifold of the group of all diffeomorphisms .",
    "we study its second fundamental form and introduce the associated shape operator .",
    "the focal points of this infinite - dimensional submanifold turn out to correspond to shocks forming in potential solutions of the inviscid burgers equation on the underlying finite - dimensional domain .",
    "this provides a common geometric framework for both eulerian hydrodynamics of ideal fluids and the phenomenon of shocks of the inviscid burgers equation .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath0 be a compact @xmath1-dimensional riemannian manifold .",
    "consider the group @xmath2 of sobolev class diffeomorphisms of @xmath0 along with its subgroup @xmath3 of diffeomorphisms preserving the riemannian volume form @xmath4 .",
    "( as usual , if @xmath5 both groups can be considered as smooth hilbert manifolds . ) for a curve @xmath6 in @xmath2 defined on an interval @xmath7 $ ] its @xmath8-energy is given by @xmath9 where the norm @xmath10 is defined by the @xmath8-inner product @xmath11 on each tangent space @xmath12 .",
    "the corresponding ( weak ) riemannian metric on @xmath2 is right - invariant when restricted to the subgroup @xmath3 of volume - preserving diffeomorphisms , although it is not right - invariant on the whole of @xmath2 .",
    "arnold @xcite proved that the euler equation of an ideal incompressible fluid occupying the manifold @xmath0 , @xmath13 for a divergence - free field @xmath14 , corresponds to the equation of the geodesic flow of the above right - invariant metric on the group @xmath3 .",
    "he also showed that lagrangian instability of such flows , regarded as geodesic deviation , can be estimated in terms of sectional curvatures of the group of volume - preserving diffeomorphisms @xmath3 and provided first such curvature estimates of this group .",
    "below , by regarding the group of volume - preserving diffeomorphisms as a subgroup of the group of all diffeomorphisms ( cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite ) , we describe its sectional curvatures by means of the second fundamental form of the embedding @xmath15 and relate its principal curvatures to the distance from its nearest focal point . recall that the distance from a submanifold @xmath16 to the first focal point along a geodesic in the direction normal to this submanifold gives a lower bound on the principal curvature radius of @xmath16 ( in the subspace containing the normal direction ) : @xmath17 @xmath18    hence a lower bound on the distance to a focal point provides an upper bound for ( principal ) curvatures of @xmath16 .",
    "this motivates our study of the riemannian geometry of the embedding @xmath15 as the following sequence of implications , which we make precise below :    @xmath19 geodesics in the full diffeomorphism group @xmath2 with respect to the above @xmath8-metric are described by solutions of the inviscid burgers equation .",
    "the geodesics normal to the submanifold @xmath15 of volume - preserving diffeomorphisms are given by potential burgers solutions , see figure 1 .",
    "@xmath20 the first focal point along a ( potential ) burgers solution determines the moment when the shock wave develops .",
    "the geometry of the initial profile allows one to precisely estimate the lifespan of this solution .",
    "@xmath21 focal points along normal geodesics are in one - to - one correspondence with conjugate points along the projection of these geodesics to the space of densities @xmath22 equipped with the wasserstein @xmath8-metric .",
    "@xmath23 on the other hand , sectional curvatures of @xmath3 can be explicitly computed from the gauss - codazzi equations using the second fundamental form ( or , the corresponding shape operator ) of the embedding @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath24 the location of the first focal point along a normal geodesic can be estimated in terms of the spectral radius of the shape operator of @xmath25 .",
    "epsf    in the next three sections we describe the geometry behind relations @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "the second fundamental form , the shape operator and its spectral properties in items @xmath27 are described in section [ shape ] .",
    "a detailed analysis of the shape operator will be postponed to a future publication . in the last section we recall the properties of asymptotic directions on the diffeomorphism groups discussed in @xcite within the framework of the differential geometry of @xmath2 .",
    "finally , we mention that the connection between the lagrangian instability of ideal fluids and negativity of curvatures of the corresponding diffeomorphism group was precised by v.arnold in @xcite , and further explored in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the geometric characterization of the onset of shock waves in terms of focal points of the embedding @xmath15 is based on the following observation .",
    "geodesics in the group @xmath2 with respect to the @xmath8-metric ( [ l2-metric ] ) correspond to solutions of the burgers equation : each particle moves with constant velocity along a geodesic in @xmath0 .",
    "geodesics normal to the submanifold @xmath25 have potential initial conditions .",
    "first assume for simplicity that @xmath0 is equipped with a flat metric .",
    "then the statement that particles move with constant velocity along their own geodesics in @xmath0 follows from the `` flatness '' of the @xmath8-metric ( [ l2-metric ] ) . to see that the corresponding velocity field satisfies",
    "the burgers equation denote the flow of fluid particles by @xmath28 and let @xmath14 be its velocity field @xmath29 the chain rule immediately gives @xmath30 and hence the burgers equation on @xmath0 @xmath31 is equivalent to @xmath32 the equation of freely flying non - interacting particles in @xmath0 .    in the general case",
    ", any riemannian metric on @xmath0 induces a unique levi - civita @xmath8-connection @xmath33 on @xmath2 , which is determined pointwise by the riemannian connection @xmath34 on the manifold @xmath0 itself ( see for example @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "then the same chain rule leads to the burgers equation @xmath35 equivalent to the riemannian version of freely flying particles : @xmath36 .",
    "the latter equation has the explicit form @xmath37 , where @xmath38 are the christoffel symbols of @xmath34 in a local coordinate system @xmath39 on @xmath0 .    finally , observe that the tangent space to the subgroup @xmath25 at the identity consists of divergence - free vector fields and hence the space of normals is given by gradients of @xmath40 functions on @xmath0 .",
    "thus horizontal geodesics are the ones whose initial velocities are gradient fields @xmath41 .",
    "the following result describes a connection between focal points and formation of shocks for the burgers equation .    the first focal point to the submanifold @xmath42 in the direction @xmath43",
    "is given by the moment of the shock wave formation for the burgers equation with this initial condition @xmath41 .",
    "in the 1-dimensional case the shock wave solutions of the burgers equation appear from the inflection points of the initial velocity profile , see figure 2 .",
    "such points correspond to @xmath44 , i.e. to @xmath45 for @xmath46 .",
    "epsf    before the appearence of a shock wave any solution with smooth initial data remains smooth and the shock wave is the first moment of non - smoothness .",
    "furthermore , for a given potential @xmath47 , any such solution is given by a family of diffeomorphisms @xmath48 parameterized by time @xmath49 .",
    "the loss of smoothness occurs when the potential @xmath50 ceases to be @xmath51-concave with respect to the distance function @xmath52 on the manifold . in this case",
    "@xmath6 is no longer a diffeomorphism . on the other hand ,",
    "as long as the potential is @xmath51-concave , the curve @xmath6 remains the shortest curve joining the diffeomorphisms @xmath53 and @xmath6 , see @xcite , and focal points on @xmath6 can not appear .    finally , we note that the moment when a shock wave appears corresponds to a focal point ( i.e. , to a caustic ) , rather than to a cut ( or maxwell ) point .",
    "this follows from the fact that in any shock wave the first collisions start between neighboring particles , see e.g. @xcite . to see why such collisions lead to the existence of a neighboring shorter geodesic",
    ", one can employ the following heuristic argument .",
    "consider a shock wave generated by a solution to the 1-dimensional burgers equation with the initial velocity @xmath54 , see figure 2 .",
    "assume that this shock wave emerged at time @xmath55 and consider it at time @xmath56 .",
    "consider a perturbation @xmath57 of the original solution which at the initial moment differs from the initial velocity @xmath14 on a small segment .",
    "this segment consists of exactly those particles which are glued together in the shock wave between the times @xmath58 $ ] .",
    "perturbations @xmath57 , whose velocity profile on the @xmath59-plane ( see figure 2 ) lies below that of @xmath14 correspond to smooth perturbations of the initial velocities of these particles , slowing them down to ensure that the shock wave develops after time @xmath55 but no later than @xmath60 .",
    "note that such a perturbation defines another solution which coincides with the original one after time @xmath60 but represents a shorter geodesic .",
    "indeed , since we decreased the velocity vectors of the particles , the length of the new geodesic , being the integral of the velocity squares , can only get smaller . by arbitrarily shortening the segment",
    "@xmath58 $ ] this implies that the first moment @xmath55 of the original shock wave for the initial condition @xmath14 indeed defines a focal point , rather than a cut point , since there exists a shorter geodesic nearby .    in higher dimensions",
    "the shock waves are first generated from the special points of the initial potential @xmath61 : singularities of type @xmath62 modulo certain linear and quadratic terms in local orthogonal coordinate charts , see @xcite .",
    "the list of initial singularities , possible bifurcations of the shock waves and other related questions for the inviscid burgers equations , can be found in @xcite .",
    "a given shock wave for the burgers equation forms at a caustic corresponding to a deeper degeneration of this potential , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the most degenerate caustic points correspond to the endpoints of the spectrum for the shape operator @xmath63 , which we describe below .",
    "the lifespan of a solution before the shock formation provides an estimate for the spectrum of this operator : a _ lower bound _ for the lifespan , and hence for the distance to the first focal point gives the _ upper bound _ for the ( principal ) curvatures of the submanifold @xmath15 .",
    "next we would like to show that conjugate points along geodesics in the wasserstein space of densities are in 1 - 1 correspondence with focal points on the group of diffeomorphisms .",
    "namely , consider the fibration @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the projection of diffeomorphisms onto the space of ( normalized ) densities on @xmath0 .",
    "thus , two diffeomorphisms @xmath66 and @xmath67 belong to the same fiber if and only if @xmath68 for some volume - preserving diffeomorphism @xmath69 .",
    "( moreover , this projection can be defined for more general maps by tracing how they transport the given standard density form on @xmath0 . )",
    "the map @xmath65 is a riemannian submersion @xcite and the above @xmath8-metric on @xmath2 induces the wasserstein ( or , kantorovich ",
    "rubinstein ) metric in the space of densities @xmath22 .",
    "the following general observation holds .",
    "consider a projection @xmath70 between two ( possibly weak ) riemannian manifolds which is a riemannian submersion and where @xmath71 an infinite - dimensional lie group .",
    "let @xmath72 be a geodesic starting at a point @xmath73 in @xmath74 and let @xmath75 be a horizontal lift of this geodesic to @xmath71 , i.e. a horizontal geodesic in @xmath71 whose initial point lies in the fiber @xmath76 and whose projection to @xmath74 is @xmath72",
    ". assume , in addition , that the metric restricted to @xmath76 is right invariant .",
    "( in our case , the fiber @xmath76 is the group @xmath3 of volume - preserving diffeomorphisms for @xmath73 ) .",
    "[ prop : gamma ] the points along the geodesic @xmath77 conjugate to the initial position @xmath73 are in one - to - one correspondence with the focal points of the fiber @xmath78 , regarded as a submanifold in @xmath71 , along a horizontal geodesic @xmath75 in @xmath71 .",
    "moreover , the multiplicities of the conjugate points in @xmath74 coincide with the multiplicities of the corresponding focal points in @xmath71 .",
    "recall that conjugate points and their generalizations , the focal points , arise as singularities of the riemannian exponential map . in a general infinite - dimensional space",
    "two types of such points , called epi - conjugate ( epi - focal ) and mono - conjugate ( mono - focal ) points , can be found .",
    "roughly speaking , geometric significance of the former has to do with covering properties of the exponential map , while the latter are responsible for the minimizing properties of geodesics .",
    "the statement follows from the submersion property of @xmath65 .",
    "since geodesics in the base manifold have unique lifts to horizontal geodesics in @xmath71 we can identify the geodesics emanating from @xmath73 that are close to @xmath72 and which come together near a conjugate point in @xmath79 with the horizontal geodesics emanating from @xmath76 , that are close to @xmath80 and come together near the focal point in @xmath71 .",
    "furthermore , the argument works for both mono- and epi - conjugate ( or focal ) points , since the exponential map is nondegenerate along the fibers .",
    "indeed , shifts along the fibers correspond to right multiplication by an element of @xmath76 , while the metric in @xmath71 is @xmath76-invariant .",
    "geodesics in the wasserstein space @xmath22 of ( smooth ) densities are projections of the horizontal geodesics in the diffeomorphism group @xmath2 . for a given potential @xmath81",
    "they are the diffeomorphisms @xmath82 parameterized by @xmath49 . according to the theorem on polar decomposition on manifolds @xcite every non - degenerate map @xmath83 has a unique decomposition @xmath84 into a `` gradient map '' @xmath85 for a @xmath51-concave potential @xmath81 and a volume - preserving map @xmath86 .",
    "consequently , the projection of the family of diffeomorphisms @xmath87 remains a shortest geodesic in @xmath74 ( in the space of non - degenerate maps ) as long as the potential @xmath88 remains @xmath51-concave .",
    "we next turn to the shape operator of the embedding @xmath15 .",
    "the eigenvalues of this operator are traditionally called the principal curvatures and the corresponding eigenvectors of unit norm are the principal directions . in our case , at each point in @xmath25 there is a family of shape operators parametrized by vectors normal to the submanifold .",
    "the _ shape operator _ of the submanifold @xmath3 at the identity is the operator @xmath89 on @xmath90 defined by @xmath91 where @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 are in @xmath90 and @xmath95 is the second fundamental form of @xmath25 . by right invariance",
    "we similarly define the shape operator at any point @xmath75 in @xmath25 .",
    "recall that the ( weak ) riemannian metric on @xmath2 induces on both the group @xmath2 and its subgroup @xmath25 the unique levi - civita connections @xmath33 and @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the hodge projection @xmath98 onto divergence - free vector fields on @xmath0 conjugated with the right translation by @xmath75 ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "the second fundamental form @xmath99 of the submanifold @xmath100 is the difference of the two connections , which at the identity is given by @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the hodge projection onto the gradient fields on @xmath0 .",
    "the second fundamental form , as well as the curvature tensors of the connections on @xmath2 and @xmath25 , are bounded multilinear operators satisfying the gauss - codazzi equations , see @xcite .",
    "the above gives an explicit formula for the shape operator at the identity @xmath103 one can check that the shape operator is bounded and self - adjoint .",
    "the next result provides an estimate of the distance to the first focal point along a normal geodesic in terms of the spectral radius of @xmath63 .",
    "[ thmf ] suppose that @xmath0 is a compact manifold of non - negative sectional curvature .",
    "let @xmath6 be the geodesic normal to @xmath25 at @xmath104 with @xmath105 and let @xmath106 .",
    "then @xmath6 contains a focal point in the interval @xmath107 .    in this case our strategy to show existence of focal points along geodesics normal to the fibre @xmath25 is to obtain estimates on the second variation of the @xmath8-energy ( [ energy ] ) .",
    "the latter is given by the following formula @xmath108 for any vector field @xmath109 along @xmath75 such that @xmath110 is tangent to the fibre @xmath25 and @xmath111 .",
    "here @xmath112 is the curvature of the connection @xmath33 on the group @xmath2 .",
    "we discuss this theorem and its proof in detail in a future publication .",
    "we point out that the conclusion of theorem [ thmf ] holds provided that the geodesic @xmath75 is defined on the interval @xmath113 $ ] .",
    "furthermore , this geodesic does not minimize the @xmath8-distance between @xmath25 and any @xmath6 with @xmath114 and hence the focal point is in fact mono - focal .",
    "another corollary of the same formula for the second variation is as follows .",
    "[ cor : non - pos ] suppose now that @xmath0 has non - positive sectional curvature .",
    "consider any initial vector @xmath115 with a convex function @xmath47 .",
    "then there can be no focal points on the corresponding geodesic .",
    "indeed , for such a manifold @xmath0 and any @xmath109 one obtains @xmath116 in particular , if @xmath47 is convex then its hessian @xmath117 is non - negative and so @xmath118 , implying the absence of focal points between @xmath53 and any other @xmath119 .",
    "asymptotic directions for the group of volume - preserving diffeomorhisms also appear naturally in the context of the exterior geometry of this group .",
    "recall , that a vector tangent to a riemannian submanifold is _ asymptotic _ if the ( vector - valued ) second fundamental form evaluated on it is zero .",
    "the geodesics issued in the direction of this vector , one in the submanifold and the other in the ambient manifold , have a second order of tangency .",
    "( note that in general two geodesics with a common tangent will have only a simple , i.e. first order , tangency . ) asymptotic vectors for the submanifold of volume - preserving diffeomorhisms among all diffeomorhisms are given at the tangent space to the identity by vector fields @xmath120 satisfying @xmath121 , see @xcite . such fields rarely exist .",
    "for instance , for diffeomorhism groups of surfaces one has the following sufficient condition for non - existence of such directions .",
    "consider the square length function @xmath123 on @xmath0 . at its maximum point @xmath124",
    "we get from @xmath125 that the jacobi matrix @xmath126 is degenerate at @xmath124 .",
    "this implies that @xmath127}=0 $ ] for a divergence - free field @xmath120 .    now employing the identity @xmath128 where @xmath129 stands for the ricci curvature of the metric @xmath130 , which holds for any divergence - free vector field @xmath120 on @xmath0 , we find that @xmath131 since in two dimensions the ricci curvature @xmath129 and the gaussian curvature @xmath132 coincide .",
    "however , for an asymptotic field @xmath120 this implies that @xmath133 contradicting the assumption @xmath134 on @xmath0 , and in particular at the point @xmath124 .",
    "vanishing of the second fundamental form on asymptotic vectors implies vanishing of the projections of this form to any gradient direction .",
    "in particular , such vectors must be asymptotic simultaneously for all the projections of the second fundamental form described above .",
    "this implies the following sufficient condition for the non - existence of asymptotic directions : if at least in one of the gradient projections the second fundamental form is sign - definite , then there are no asymptotic directions .",
    "the latter sufficient condition can also be given in terms of gradient solutions of the burgers equation : in such a gradient direction all shocks develop only as @xmath49 changes in the one direction ( say , increases ) , and do not develop as @xmath49 changes in the other direction .",
