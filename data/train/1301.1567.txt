    "the idea to apply the coherent elastic scattering of photons ( compton scattering ) to an investigation of the internal structure of the nucleon dates back to the early 1950s . at that time",
    "the structure of the nucleon was mainly discussed in terms of a bare nucleon surrounded by a `` pion cloud '' . in the framework of this simple model the polarization of the pion cloud leads to an absorption of the incoming photon and the emision of the outgoing photon and thus to a compton scattering process .",
    "estimates carried out by sachs and foldy in 1950 showed that the pion - cloud polarization should lead to a small modification of the thomson scattering cross section @xcite . later on in 1957 the proposal was made by aleksandrov @xcite to measure cross sections for the scattering of slow neutrons in the coulomb field of heavy nuclei . in this case",
    "it was predicted that the pion - cloud polarization leads to a small modification of schwinger s scattering cross section which takes into account the effects of the anomalous magnetic moment of the neutron . for the proton",
    "the scattering in a coulomb field is no option because of the electric charge of the proton .",
    "the first experiment on compton scattering by the proton to measure the polarizability was carried out in 1958 .",
    "the final experiment of high precision was performed at mami ( mainz ) by olmos de len et al in 2001 @xcite .",
    "an extensive description of these experiments and their analyses may be found in @xcite the weighted averages of these results are given in table 1 of the present work .",
    "first experiments on electromagnetic scattering of slow neutrons have been carried out from 1986 to 1988 .",
    "the results of these experiments are listed in table 2 of @xcite .",
    "these first experiments remained of rather limited precision .",
    "great progress has been made in an experiment carried out by schmiedmayer et al . in 1991",
    "the result obtained in @xcite is discussd in subsection 2.6 of the present paper .",
    "as a second option to measure the electromagnetic polarizabilities of the neutron quasifree compton scattering by a neutron bound in a deuteron has been proposed by levchuk et al .",
    "@xcite . in this case",
    "only the internal structure of the neutron is excited whereas the proton merely serves as a spectator .",
    "the first high - precision experiment of this kind has been carried out by kossert et al . in 2002 @xcite , leading to a result which is discussed in subsection 2.6 of the present paper together with the result of electromagnetic scattering of neutrons @xcite .    in principle also the cohenrent elastic compton scattering by the deuteron may be exploited . in this case",
    "the sum of the proton and neutron polarizabilities is measured which may be used to arrive at the polarizability of the neutron by subtracting the proton polarizability .",
    "a first experiment of this kind has ben carried out by lundin et al . @xcite and it has been proposed to repeat the experiment in order to arrive at a higher precision @xcite      a number of theoretical papers concerned with the polarizabilities of the nucleon based on nucleon models have been published in the 1980s .",
    "these investigations include the mit bag model , the nonrelativistic quark model , the chiral quark model , the chiral soliton model and the skyrme model .",
    "the investigations based nucleon models ceased with the advent of effective field theories at the beginning of the 1990s .",
    "these latter theories attracted many researchers and still are a subject of active investigations .",
    "some information on the early activities may be found in @xcite .",
    "for the status of the present activities we wish to cite the recent article `` using effective field theory to analysis low - energy compton scattering data from protons and light nuclei '' @xcite and `` signatures of chiral dynamics in low - energy compton scattering off the nucleon '' @xcite . in the analyses described in @xcite",
    "the polarizabilities are treated as free parameters .",
    "the results obtained may be compared with the present _ recommended _ values . in @xcite",
    "a projection formalism is presented which allows to define dynamical polarizabilities of the nucleon from a multipole expansion of the nucleon compton amplitudes .",
    "these dynamical polarizabilities may be compared with the corresponding quantities presented in section 6 of the present work .",
    "since these investigations @xcite have been published recently , the papers cited therein should give a complete overview .",
    "the purpose of the present article is to give a concise status report on the research topic of nucleon compton scattering and polarizabilities , by describing the results achieved on the basis of dispersion theory since the latest review article published in 2005 @xcite , partly based on published and partly on recent unpublished investigations .",
    "the published results are distributed over a larger number of papers @xcite .",
    "this makes it difficult for the reader to get insight into the present status of development and makes a status report on the results highly advisable .",
    "the present status report includes a complete precise prediction of the polarizabilities and their interpretation in terms of degrees of freedom of the nucleon .",
    "the progress made for the prediction of the nucleon structure ( @xmath28-channel ) part has been made possible by high - precision analyses @xcite of photomeson data and their conversion into partial photoabsorption cross sections for all resonant and nonresonant photoexcitation processes of the nucleon @xcite .",
    "these high - precision analyses contain the most precise information on the electromagnetic structure of the nucleon available at present .",
    "using dispersion relations these partial photoabsorption cross sections can be transferred into polarizabilities . as a consequence",
    "we have a method to precisely predict the polarizabilities of the nucleon on the basis of meson photoproduction data which includes all processes which are considered as the degrees of freedom of the nucleon .",
    "however , when carrying out these predictions of electromagnetic polarizabilities one is led to a severe problem .",
    "the electric polarizability @xmath29 predicted in this way amounts to only about 40% of the experimental value and the magnetic polarizability @xmath30 overshoots the experimental value by about a factor of 5 .",
    "apparently there is a missing piece in the electric polarizability and a strong diamagnetic component which compensates the predicted paramagnetic polarizability .",
    "predictions based on models of the nucleon are in general not sensitive to details of the problems outlined above . on the other hand , already in 1974 t.e.o .",
    "ericson and coworkers ( beft ) @xcite carried out calculations on the basis of dispersion relations which led to the discovery of the missing piece in the electric polarizability and to the missing diamagnetic polarizability .",
    "these authors found a way of solving this severe problem by tracing it back to the scalar @xmath0-channel contribution introduced by hearn and leader in 1962 @xcite .",
    "quantitatively , the results obtained in @xcite remained of rather limited precision .",
    "therefore , in the following years further calculations were carried out by a number of researchers with more or less success as far as the numerical results are concerned .",
    "the main problem persisting up to the present was to get data of sufficient precision for the scalar two - photon excitation process leading to a pion pair in the final state .",
    "this line of development is described in detail in the previous review @xcite .    in @xcite",
    "a step further is made by asking the question how this scalar @xmath0-channel can be understood in terms of degrees of freedom of the nucleon , a question which had never been asked before . since the structure of the nucleon as observed in photomeson experiments is exhausted by the @xmath28-channel it was considered as likely that the @xmath0-channel is related to the mesonic structure of the constituent quarks .",
    "this idea was worked out in a series of investigations @xcite and proved to be extremely successful after it had been noted that the quark - level linear @xmath21 model ( qll@xmath21 m ) as developed by delbourgo , scadron and coworkers @xcite leads to a quantitative agreement with the experimental data . in this way",
    "the missing part of the electric polarizability and the diamagnetic polarizability were traced back to the @xmath21 meson as part of the constituent - quark structure . from the point of view of chiral symmetry breaking this does not come as a surprise .",
    "chiral symmetry breaking explains the mass of the constituent quark in terms of the exchange of the @xmath21 meson with @xmath31 loops of the qcd vacuum .",
    "this necessarily leads to a @xmath21 meson as part of the constituent - quark structure .",
    "the nucleon model introduced above containing a @xmath21 meson as part of the constituent - quark structure is strongly supported by a compton scattering experiment on the proton carried out at mami ( mainz ) in the 1990s and published in 2001 @xcite . in this experiment it has been shown that the scalar @xmath0-channel makes a strong contribution to the compton scattering amplitude in the second resonance region of the nucleon at large scattering angles . this contribution is successfully represented in terms of a @xmath0-channel pole located at @xmath32 as introduced by lvov et al . in 1997",
    "@xcite where @xmath33 is the `` bare '' mass ( see subsection 5.4 ) . ] of the @xmath21 meson , determined in this experiment to be @xmath34 mev .",
    "the error given here corresponds to the uncertainty of the cgln amplitude representing the @xmath35 resonance .",
    "details are given in section 6 .",
    "in spite of this great success the physical interpretation of the experiment remained uncertain because the @xmath21 meson was not a generally accepted particle at that time .",
    "this led to a delay in the final interpretation of the experiment , because additional detailed theoretical investigations were required in oder to remove the remaining uncertainties .",
    "the breakthrough came in 2006 @xcite when it was shown that it is possible to quantitatively predict the scalar @xmath0-channel part of the electromagnetic polarizabilities in terms of the qll@xmath21 m and thus proving that the @xmath0-channel part of the compton - scattering amplitude is a property of the structure of the constituent quarks .",
    "this result was further worked out in a series of additional investigation @xcite .",
    "in the course of these further investigations it was realized that the @xmath21 meson provides by far the largest part of the scalar @xmath0-channel contribution .",
    "but there are also smaller contributions from the @xmath26 and @xmath27 scalar mesons .",
    "these mesons together with the @xmath21 meson are members of the scalar nonet @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath26 @xmath27 .",
    "this observation led to the attempt to extend the qll@xmath21 m of @xcite to su(3 ) .",
    "the investigation carried out in @xcite showed that the members of the scalar nonet have the same mass in the chiral limit ( cl ) amounting to @xmath38 mev .",
    "this degeneracy is removed via explicit symmetry breaking by taking into account the effects of the finite current - quark masses , applying the rules of spontaneous and dynamical symmetry breaking .",
    "the present review is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we present an updated list of _ recommended _ experimental values for the polarizabilities .",
    "new arguments are given in favor of the value @xmath39@xmath10 of the neutron electric polarizability .",
    "a slight modification of the _ recommended _ value of @xmath40 is found . in section 3",
    "we derive a complete list of predicted contributions to the @xmath28-channel polarizabilities . in section 4",
    "we describe the properties of the invariant amplitudes and their relation to the polarizabilities .",
    "section 5 is concerned with the @xmath0-channel polarizabilities .",
    "since the methods and results for the @xmath0-channel are widely unknown we provide an extended description of the @xmath0-channel aimed to arrive at high clarity . in section 6 we describe compton scattering in a large angular range and at energies up to 1 gev , with emphasis on interference effects between nucleon structure ( @xmath28-channel ) and constituent - quark structure ( @xmath0-channel ) contributions .",
    "in the following we will outline the basic relations used in our studies of nucleon compton scattering and polarizabilities beginning with a classic approach to the polarizabilities .",
    "we will see that in addition to the electromagnetic polarizabilities @xmath29 and @xmath30 spin - polarizabilities @xmath41 and @xmath42 for compton scattering in the forward and backward directions are required .",
    "the experiments and the experimental results have been described in previous works @xcite .",
    "this makes it sufficient for the present review to only summarize the experimental results      a nucleon in an electric field @xmath43 and magnetic field @xmath44 obtains an induced electric dipole moment @xmath45 and magnetic dipole moment @xmath46 given by @xmath47 in a unit system where the electric charge @xmath48 is given by @xmath49 .",
    "( [ electric ] ) and ( [ magnetic ] ) may be understood as the response of the nucleon to the fields provided by a real or virtual photon and it is evident that we need a second photon to measure the polarizabilities .",
    "this may be expressed through the relation @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the energy change in the electromagnetic field due to the presence of the nucleon in the field .",
    "compton scattering contains the most effective method to provide two photons interacting simultaneously with the nucleon .",
    "therefore , compton scattering is the method of first choice for the measurement of polarizabilities .",
    "the second method is the electromagnetic scattering of slow neutrons in the electric field of a heavy nucleus .",
    "the differential cross section for compton scattering @xmath52 may be written in the form @xcite @xmath53 with @xmath54 in the lab frame ( @xmath55 , @xmath56 = lab energies of the incoming and outgoing photon ) and @xmath57 in the cm frame ( @xmath58 = total energy ) .",
    "for the following discussion it is convenient to use the lab frame and to consider special cases for the amplitude @xmath59 .",
    "these special cases are the extreme forward ( @xmath60 ) and extreme backward ( @xmath61 ) direction where the amplitudes for compton scattering may be written in the form @xcite @xmath62_{\\theta=0 } = f_0(\\omega){{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\epsilon$}}}'{}^*\\cdot{{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\epsilon$}}}+ g_0(\\omega)\\ , \\mbox{i}\\ , { { \\mbox{\\boldmath$\\sigma$}}}\\cdot({{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\epsilon$}}}'{}^*\\times { { \\mbox{\\boldmath$\\epsilon$ } } } ) , \\label{t0}\\\\ & & \\frac{1}{8\\pi m}[t_{fi}]_{\\theta=\\pi } = f_\\pi(\\omega){{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\epsilon$}}}'{}^*\\cdot{{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\epsilon$}}}+ g_\\pi(\\omega)\\ , \\mbox{i}\\,{{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\sigma$}}}\\cdot({{{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\epsilon$}}}}'{}^ * \\times { { { \\mbox{\\boldmath$\\epsilon$ } } } } ) ,   \\label{tpi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath63 being the nucleon mass , @xmath64 the polarization of the photon and @xmath65 the spin vector .    the process described in ( [ t0 ] ) is the transmission of linearly polarized photons through a medium as provided by a nucleon with spin vector @xmath65 parallel or antiparallel to the direction of the incident photon with rotation of the direction of linear polarization .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath66 and @xmath67 correspond to the polarization components of the outgoing photon parallel and perpendicular to the direction of linear polarization of the incoming photon .",
    "the interpretation of ( [ tpi ] ) is the same as that of ( [ t0 ] ) except for the fact that the photon is reflected . in case of forward scattering ( [ t0 ] ) the origin of the rotation of the direction of linear polarization",
    "may be related partly to the alignment of the internal magnetic dipole moments of the nucleon and partly to the dynamics of the pion cloud . in case of backward scattering ( [ tpi ] ) a large portion of the relevant phenomenon",
    "is of a completely different origin .",
    "this is the @xmath0-channel contribution which will be studied in detail in the following .",
    "it is important to realize that in contrast to frequent belief there is no flip of any spin in the two cases of compton scattering .",
    "the factor @xmath65 in the second terms of the two equations may be interpreted as a spin dependence of scattering in the sense that the direction of rotation of the electric vector changes sign ( from @xmath68 clock - wise to anti clock - wise ) when the spin of the target nucleon is reversed .",
    "the two scattering processes may also be related to the two states of circular polarization , i.e. helicity amplitudes for forward and backward compton scattering .",
    "if the photon and nucleon spins are parallel ( photon helicity @xmath69 , nucleon helicity @xmath70 , and net helicity in the photon direction @xmath71 ) then the amplitude is @xmath72 while for the spins being anti - parallel ( photon helicity @xmath69 , nucleon helicity @xmath73 , and net helicity along the photon direction @xmath74 ) the amplitude is @xmath75 the amplitudes @xmath76 and @xmath77 are related by the optical theorem to the total cross sections @xmath78 and @xmath79 for the reaction @xmath80 when the photon spin is parallel or anti - parallel to the nucleon spin : @xmath81 therefore , @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the spin averaged total cross section and @xmath84 . for the backward direction we obtain @xmath85 , \\label{optical-5}\\\\ { \\rm im}g_\\pi(\\omega)&=&\\frac{\\omega}{8\\pi}\\left[\\delta\\sigma(\\omega , \\delta p={\\rm yes } ) -",

    "the nucleon has a spin and because of this the two electric and magnetic vectors have the option of being perpendicular to each other .",

    "in addition to the experimental results given in ( [ schmiedmayer ] ) and ( [ kossert ] ) we may take into consideration a determination of the neutron polarizability from the proton polarizability by making use of predicted isovector components of the nucleon polarizabilities . this method has been proposed and applied for the first time in @xcite .",
    "the relevant numbers may be found in @xcite and in tables [ polresults1 ] and [ tab4 ] of the present work . as shown before the electromagnetic polarizabilities consist of an @xmath28-channel contribution due to the excited states of the nucleon and a @xmath0-channel contribution due to the scalar mesons @xmath21 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 . for the proton the present method of calculation leads to predictions which are in excellent agreement with the experimental electromagnetic polarizabilities .",
    "since the experimental value for @xmath23 has an error of only 5% we may tentatively conclude that the present method of predicting the electric polarizabilities of the proton and the neutron has been tested at a level of precision of 5% .",

    "but it would be of advantage to have an experimental confirmation . the excellent agreement between predicted and experimental polarizabilities observed for the proton means that the @xmath28-channel prediction is confirmed to be precise , but for the @xmath0-channel only the @xmath21-meson part and the cancellation of the @xmath26 and @xmath27 contributions are confirmed but not the sign of @xmath137 .",
    "this sign can only be determined by a high - precision experiment on the neutron and has to be left as an open problem as long as such an experiment has not been carried out . because of this we give in the following predictions for @xmath135 including and not including the effects of @xmath26 and @xmath27 and the latter also with a reversed sign .",
    "these predictions are @xmath138 apparently this rather straightforward determination of the electric polarizability of the neutron strongly supports the experimental results given in ( [ schmiedmayer ] ) and ( [ kossert ] ) .",
    "furthermore , there is a tendency towards a larger value for @xmath135 rather than a smaller value than @xmath2 ( see pdg 2012 @xcite ) .",
    "this gives us confidence that the weighted average of the two experimental results in ( [ schmiedmayer ] ) and ( [ kossert ] ) is a good choice for a @xmath20 final result as given in table [ exresults ] .",
    "for the experiments to come it can be predicted that the neutron electric polarizability obtained in a high - precision experiment should be close to the interval @xmath139 .",
    "in the following partial contributions to the @xmath28-channel part of the polarizabilities are calculated from the corresponding partial photoabsorption cross sections using dispersion relations .",
    "therefore , we first have to explain how these partial photoabsorption cross sections are generated .",
    "two different approaches are possible which will be described in the following .",
    "the first makes use of total photoabsorption cross sections analyzed in terms of resonant and nonresonant partial cross sections @xcite and the other of high - precision analyses @xcite of photomeson data and their conversion into partial photoabsorption cross sections .",
    "figure [ absorption-2 ] shows the total photoabsorption cross section of the proton .",
    "this figure has already been published in the 1970th @xcite and there are more precise data available .",
    "the advantage of this figure over these more recent data is that dispersion theory has been used to disentangle the total photoabsorption cross section into partial cross sections which can be identified with the @xmath28-channel degrees of freedom of the nucleon . in figure [ absorption-2 ]",
    "we see three main resonant states , the @xmath35 state which can be excited via a @xmath140 transition and thus is responsible for the large paramagnetism of the nucleon , the @xmath141 state which can be reached via an @xmath142 transition and the @xmath143 which can be reached via an @xmath144 transition .",
    "these main resonant states correspond to the three oscillator shells with oscillator quantum numbers @xmath145 , @xmath146 and @xmath147 respectively .",
    "the further weaker resonances are identified in the caption .    , @xmath148 , @xmath149 , @xmath150 , @xmath143 and @xmath151 .",
    "the nonresonant component is of electric dipole @xmath152 or @xmath153 multipolarity as shown in the right panel and a mixture of @xmath154 and @xmath155 multipolarity at higher energies ]    in addition to the resonances , figure [ absorption-2 ] contains a continuous nonresonant part .",
    "this continuous part of the spectrum corresponds to the nonresonant cross section where the low - energy part up to about 500 mev is mainly given by the @xmath153 electric - dipole ( e1 ) single - pion photoproduction process .",
    "there are also minor magnetic - dipole ( m1 ) and mixed m1e2 single - pion photoproduction processes . at higher energies",
    "the photoabsorption cross section is due to two - pion processes which mainly are of the type @xmath156 and , thus combine nonresonant and resonant processes during the absorption .",
    "though figure [ absorption-2 ] is very useful as an overview @xcite for quantitative predictions of partial photoabsorption cross sections information is more appropriate which has been obtained in recent time from the study of photo - meson amplitudes @xcite .",
    "this will be explained in more detail in subsection 3.3 .",
    "figure [ absorption-2 ] shows only the strongest resonances located below 2 gev excitation energy .",

    "quantitative information on the strength is given in @xcite in terms of integrated photoabsorption cross sections . in figure [ secondshell ]",
    "the strong states are depicted by thick bars .",
    "the first resonance region is solely due to the @xmath35 state which as a @xmath161 state is of equal photon - excitation strength for the proton and the neutron .",
    "the second resonance region is due to the @xmath141 state and to a lesser extent to the @xmath150 state .",
    "the third resonance region consists of the @xmath143 and the @xmath162 states . for the proton the two contributions are of approximately equal strength , whereas for the neutron according to the general rule for @xmath163 states based on the quark model the @xmath143 contribution is largely suppressed .",
    "the fourth resonance is due to the @xmath151 state which is of equal strength for the proton and the neutron",
    ".      for the prediction of resonant cross sections in principle a direct calculation from the cgln amplitudes is possible , provided the one - pion branching @xmath164 of the resonances is taken into account where necessary .",
    "however , as shown in @xcite , a much more precise procedure is available .",
    "this method makes use of the parameters of the resonances extracted from the cgln data @xcite .    for the precise prediction of @xmath165 we use the walker parameterization of resonant states where the cross sections are represented in terms of lorentzians in the form @xmath166 where @xmath167 is the resonance energy of the resonance .",
    "the functions @xmath168 and @xmath169 are chosen such that a precise representation of the shapes of the resonances are obtained .",
    "the appropriate parameterizations and the related references are given in @xcite .",

    "tabulations of values adopted for the present purpose are given in @xcite .",
    "the cross - section difference @xmath172 can also be calculated directly from the cgln amplitudes .",
    "but also for this difference we propose a more appropriate procedure .",
    "this procedure makes use of the fact that precise values for total cross sections @xmath173 are easier to obtain than for the cross section differences @xmath172 .",
    "therefore , we start from the relation @xmath174 where @xmath175 refers to the different resonant states .",

    "the resonance couplings @xmath176 and @xmath177 , the widths @xmath171 and the scaling factors @xmath178 entering into ( [ crossansatz ] ) are tabulated in @xcite .    in figure [ coordinates1 ] we show the total resonant cross sections for the individual resonances of the proton and the neutron .",
    "four resonance regions are clearly visible in both cases , however with the difference that for the neutron the third resonance region is largely suppressed .",
    "this difference may be traced back to the @xmath143 resonance which is smaller by a factor of 10 for the neutron as compared with the proton .",
    "figure [ coordinates2 ] shows the corresponding cross section differences @xmath172 . here again the line obtained for the @xmath143 resonance is largely suppressed in case of the neutron .",
    "recent measurements at mami ( mainz ) and elsa ( bonn ) have led to very valuable data for the helicity dependence of the total photo - absorption cross section of the proton and the neutron @xcite . in the following",
    "we will compare experimental data obtained for the proton with the predictions of the present approach .",
    "we restrict the discussion to the proton because of the higher precision of the experimental data as compared to the neutron .    in figure [ mami ]",
    "we discuss experimental data obtained at mami ( mainz ) . in order to clearly demonstrate the resonant structure of the first and the second resonance we have eliminated the nonresonant contribution from the figure and only keep the resonant contribution .",
    "the baseline of the resonant contribution now is the abscissa .",
    "technically this has been achieved by adding the predicted nonresonant contribution to the experimental data .",

    "this makes it possible to apply this procedure also to other problems as there is the prediction and interpretation of the @xmath28-channel contribution to the forward and backward angle spin - polarizabilities @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "furthermore , we have clearly demonstrated that the upper part of the cross section in the right panel of figure [ elsa ] is due to the @xmath151 resonance as anticipated before @xcite .",
    "due to @xmath28-wave single pion photoproduction for the proton ( p ) and the neutron ( n ) .",

    "this has been discussed in the textbook of ericson and weise ( see p. 286 of @xcite ) .",
    "the explanation is that for meson photoproduction the electric dipole amplitude @xmath153 is larger for the reaction @xmath187 than for the reaction @xmath188 because of the larger electric dipole moment in the final state .",
    "indeed the ratio of the two cross sections given for the born approximation can be obtained from ratio of the @xmath189 and @xmath190 dipole moments .",
    "the difference in dipole moments which also shows up in the empirical @xmath153 cross sections leads to an explanation for the fact that the neutron has a larger electric polarizability than the proton .",
    "the empirical cross section shown in figure [ e0plus ] above @xmath191 mev are extrapolations of data given in @xcite .",
    "the extrapolation was necessary because this cross section is purely nonresonant only up to @xmath192 mev .",
