    "the blue star lb 3459 ( hd269696 ; @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) , and situated at high galactic latitude ( @xmath8 ) , was discovered to be variable in brightness by kilkenny , hilditch & penfold ( 1978 ) .",
    "observations with the university of cape town high - speed photometer revealed the light curve of an eclipsing binary ( designated aa doradus ) with an orbital period of 0.261 day and a primary eclipse of depth 0.4 mag in the v - band .",
    "spectroscopic and further photometric observations followed over many years , and the present understanding of the properties of this remarkable binary system is summarized in hilditch , harries & hill ( 1996 ) ( hereafter hhh ) , and in rauch ( 2000 ) where references to previous publications on this system may be found .",
    "hhh obtained chelle spectra of aa  dor from the anglo- australian telescope and determined a velocity semi - amplitude for the sdob primary star of @xmath9 .",
    "many attempts to detect spectral signatures of the secondary component from these data failed , and hhh were forced to adopt a representative mass of @xmath10 for the sdo star in order to calculate the mass of the secondary star from the derived mass function and the earlier light - curve analyses , and establish the absolute sizes of the stars in this system .",
    "the sdob star seemed to be an unremarkable member of that class of evolved stars , whilst the unseen secondary component at @xmath11 seemed to be a degenerate red dwarf of surface temperature @xmath12 .",
    "the derived surface gravity of the primary star was found to be @xmath13 which was in some disagreement with an earlier nlte analysis by kudritski,_et al . _",
    "( 1982 ) , where a value of @xmath14 was derived .",
    "hhh recommended that a new determination of @xmath15 from spectral line profiles would help to resolve this issue and permit a direct determination of the mass of the sdob star and therefore also the secondary component .",
    "the more recent work by rauch ( 2000 ) addressed this issue directly by detailed nlte analysis of high resolution optical and ultraviolet spectra .",
    "rauch obtained an effective temperature for the primary component of @xmath16 , in agreement with kudritski _",
    "et al . _ , and a value of @xmath17 which clearly exacerbated the problem .",
    "he also derived a mass for the sdo star of @xmath18 from comparison of the location of the primary in the @xmath19 plane with evolution tracks for post - rgb stars .",
    "the consequent mass for the secondary component was @xmath20 which places it firmly in the brown dwarf category .",
    "with the discrepancy about the surface gravity still unresolved , we decided to secure new complete light curves of aa dor in the @xmath4 and @xmath21 bands in order to re - determine the radii of both stars relative to the semi - major axis of the relative orbit .",
    "most recently , rauch & werner ( 2003 ) have published a new spectroscopic study of aa  dor based upon many 180s - exposure uves spectrograms obtained with the eso very large telescope .",
    "because the primary eclipse of aa  dor has a total duration of only 26 minutes and a depth of 0.4 mag , it is clear that photometry has to be secured with excellent time resolution in order to ensure that the detailed shape of the eclipse curve is established without compromise .",
    "accordingly , the university of capetown ccd camera , mounted on the 1.0-m telescope at the south african astronomical observatory , was used to secure these data .",
    "this camera operates in frame - transfer mode , so that there is essentially no time lost between exposures .",
    "integration times of 15- or 20-s were used for the @xmath4 observations , and 20-s for the @xmath5 observations , ensuring that the eclipse curves were well sampled . to be certain of this time resolution ,",
    "all the observations on a single night were obtained in one filter only , rather than alternating between the @xmath4 and @xmath5 passbands .",
    "the field of view of the uct ccd camera on the 1-m telescope is only about @xmath22 arcminutes so that , despite aa  dor being a foreground object to the large magellanic cloud , the field is remarkably free of useful comparison stars .",
    "one comparison star is @xmath23 fainter than aa  dor at maximum , and the rest are all at least @xmath24 fainter .",
    "observations of the aa  dor field were obtained on 4 consecutive nights , two nights with incomplete light curves , and two nights with complete light curves , one in each of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 passbands that are in routine use at the saao .",
    "the data were reduced with an saao version of dophot , slightly modified to reduce data `` on - line '' so that an almost immediate assessment of photometric quality can be made .",
    "differential magnitudes were derived relative to the brightest comparison star using standard saao software .",
    "the constancy of this star was established by comparing it with the fainter stars in the field .",
    "infrared @xmath25 photometry was obtained using the mkiii photometer ( glass 1973 ) , with the @xmath26 chopping secondary , on the 1.88-m reflector of the saao .",
    "observations were made during two allocations of time : 1984 january 1723 and 1984 january 2730 . for each filter , observations were obtained in modules of two 10-s integrations .",
    "beamswitching occurred twice in each module , which was repeated as necessary in order to achieve the desired accuracy . on a given night , a single filter was selected and aa  dor monitored for an entire orbital period .",
    "the star hd37027 was selected as a comparison star since it was an early - type star close to aa  dor and which cousins ( 1987 ) subsequently published as a secondary @xmath27 standard star .",
    "infrared standard stars were selected from the saao list , which carter ( 1993,1995 ) later published , and observed in so far as was practicable at approximately the same airmass as aa  dor .",
    "these enabled differentially- corrected infrared magnitudes to be placed on the standard system .",
    "the intention was to detect a signature of the cool secondary component in the infrared light curves , specifically by examining whether the depth of the secondary eclipse would be found to dip below the occultation of the reflection effect by the primary , that is , below the level recorded immediately outside the primary eclipse , and thereby yield some measurement of the infrared flux from the secondary star .",
    "the data were of poorer quality than had been hoped , and they failed to show a clear signature of the flux from the secondary star beyond the known reflection effect ; they are included graphically as a further test of reflection - effect modelling , considered in section 3.3 .",
    "the most recent orbital ephemeris for aa  dor has been determined by kilkenny _",
    "et al . _ ( 2000 ) from times of primary eclipse minima observed from 1977 to 1999 .",
    "this linear ephemeris has a reference time of primary minimum of @xmath28 , and an orbital period of @xmath29 , and has been used to convert the heliocentric julian dates into orbital phases . to improve photometric accuracy ,",
    "the individual observations were added in orbital - phase bins of @xmath30 and then differential magnitudes formed between the variable and the comparison star .",
    "most bins had 2 - 3 observations yielding a typical poisson uncertainty of @xmath31 in @xmath4 and @xmath32 in @xmath5 .",
    "the two complete light curves are plotted in figure  [ vlc ] , with a total of 500 binned observations defining the @xmath4 curve from 1157 individual observations obtained on jd2451880 , and in figure  [ ilc ] with a total of 500 binned observations defining the @xmath5 curve from 1287 individual observations obtained on jd2451879 . on each of these nights",
    "complete light curves were secured and the small region of orbital - phase overlap with data obtained at the beginning and end of each night showed no differences .",
    "the overall @xmath4 curve shows some minor irregularities from a symmetric curve , but the @xmath5 curve is entirely symmetric .",
    "band light curve of aa  dor defined by 500 binned observations ( crosses with poisson uncertainties of @xmath31 ) .",
    "the solid line shows the light2 model fit to these data , whilst the dotted line is the theoretical curve with the albedo fixed at unity .",

    ", width=317 ]      the two stellar radii , expressed in terms of the semi - major axis of the relative orbit , and the orbital inclination are determined very well from the annular primary eclipse curve alone , as noted in hhh .",
    "we have used the light2 light - curve - synthesis code ( hill 1979 , hill & rucinski 1993 ) to analyse the complete @xmath4 and @xmath5 curves separately , and the results are given in table  [ geompar ] .",
    "we adopted standard values of linear limb darkening for both stars , together with standard values of the gravity darkening exponent .",
    "a mass ratio of 0.20 ( secondary / primary ) was adopted from rauch ( 2000 ) .",
    "the effective temperature of the sdo star was taken to be @xmath37 also from rauch s ( 2000 ) nlte spectral analysis , and that of the cool secondary star to be a nominal @xmath38 .",
    "solutions of the @xmath5-band curve with different fixed values of the secondary temperature ( @xmath39 ) showed that the @xmath40 value increases by a factor 2 over the range @xmath41 .",
    "the reason for this lack of dependence on the secondary temperature is simply that the flux ratio ( primary / secondary ) is @xmath42 in the @xmath5 band and @xmath43 in the @xmath4 band immediately after egress from the primary eclipse , when we see only the averted unheated hemisphere of the secondary . at the maximum of the reflection effect",
    "this ratio has reduced to 13 in @xmath5 and 19 in @xmath4 , which suggests that it should be possible to detect the heated face of the secondary in near - infrared spectra obtained at the appropriate orbital phases .",
    ".geometric parameters [ cols=\"^,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     the corresponding range of mass ratio is @xmath44 and has no effect upon the derived relative radii , orbital inclination etc from the light curve analyses .",
    "these ranges result from the assumed range of primary star mass , and are larger than the range of uncertainties that would result from propagation of the formal uncertainties of the derived quantities .",
    "they may be compared with the values determined by rauch ( 2000 ) and rauch & werner ( 2003 ) from their analyses of spectra of aa  dor .",
    "rauch ( 2000 ) derived a mass for the sdob star of @xmath45 from comparison of their derived effective temperature ( @xmath46 ) , and surface gravity ( @xmath47 ) with theoretical models for the evolution of subdwarf stars of different masses plotted in the @xmath19 plane .",
    "this value of surface gravity disagrees with that determined from the velocity curve of the primary component and the above light curve analysis .",
    "we note that rauch & werner ( 2003 ) state:``since the analysis of rauch ( 2000 ) was hampered by the relatively long exposure times ( 1h and 2 - 3h , respectively ) and hence , a relatively large orbital velocity coverage ( the observed line profiles were broadened by the star s rotation as well as by smearing due to orbital motion within the observations ) , it has been speculated that @xmath15 from rauch ( 2000 ) is somewhat too low . ''",
    "the new data reported in rauch & werner ( 2003 ) ( hereafter rw ) have exposure times of just 180s and remove this problem . from nlte model atmospheres ,",
    "rw fitted theoretical line profiles for the @xmath48 absorption line and derived @xmath49 , @xmath50 , without published uncertainties , and @xmath51 .",
    "they note , however , that this determination of @xmath52 is not as definitive as that determined by rauch ( 2000 ) from the ionization equilibria of many species , whilst the value of @xmath53 was determined from the broad balmer lines of hydrogen .",
    "later , rw note that : `` unfortunately , significant effects of changes in @xmath54 are detectable only in the outer line wings where the data reduction of the broad balmer lines in the echelle spectra is not very accurate . ''",
    "the value of @xmath50 for @xmath48 is remarkably close to the range in table  [ abspar ] derived from our radial - velocity and light - curve analyses , and the value of @xmath51 is consistent with synchronism .",
    "these new results from rw suggest that the apparent discrepancy in surface gravity may already be resolved ( cf .",
    "the above results from the @xmath48 line ) , although rw did reject this solution in favour of the rauch ( 2000 ) value . with",
    "@xmath55 and @xmath56 fixed , rw determined a rotational velocity of @xmath57 from the @xmath58 line , which is @xmath59 faster than synchronism .",
    "the ranges of mass , radius and surface gravity for the sdob star lie within the expectations of the binary population synthesis models of han _",
    "et al . _ , whilst the ranges of mass , radius and surface gravity of the unseen secondary component are consistent with models for the lowest mass dwarfs ( dorman _ et al .",
    "_ 1989 ) at the boundary of the lower main sequence and the substellar brown - dwarf region .",
    "the referee has commented that the @xmath60 values for the primary component of aa  dor place it in an unusual and relatively - short - lived phase of evolution compared to most hot subdwarf stars . when compared to the binary - star evolution models of han _",
    "( 2002 ) , or the single - star evolution models of dorman , rood & oconnell ( 1993 ) , its location would suggest that the aa  dor primary is evolved beyond the terminal - age extreme horizontal branch ( taehb ) towards the white dwarf region , a phase of evolution that lasts @xmath61 yr .",
    "we may ask whether the relative numbers of sdo and sdob stars to all hot subdwarf stars would be consistent with that view , at least in the sense of being a small proportion of the total .    from the analysis of zone 1 of the edinburgh - cape ( ec ) blue object survey , kilkenny et al ( 1997 ) found 27 sdob stars ( like the aa  dor primary ) , and 20 sdo stars out of a total of 357 identified hot subdwarfs , making proportions of @xmath62 and @xmath63 respectively . the vast majority ( @xmath64 ) are sdb stars , with the next most common being the he - sdo and he - sdb stars at @xmath65 . from the hamburg schmidt survey ( hss ) , lemke et al ( 1997 ) selected 400 stars for more detailed spectroscopic analysis . they identified 34 he - sdo stars and 13 normal sdo stars , the latter being @xmath66 of the total .",
    "their derived values of @xmath52 for these normal sdo stars lay in the wide range @xmath67 , whilst the values of @xmath15 were in the range @xmath68 with the average at @xmath69 , very similar to the aa  dor primary . these statistical results , and the model - atmosphere analyses , are consistent with the evolutionary expectations that sdo , sdob stars do lie beyond the taehb in this short - lived phase of evolution .",
    "by contrast , the very recent spectral analyses by edelmann _ et al . _",
    "( 2003 ) of sdb stars discovered in the hss is in agreement with the work of maxted _ et al . _",
    "( 2001 ) on the locations of the sdb stars mostly within the bounds between the zero - age and the terminal - age extreme horizontal branch .",
    "revised values of the mean radii of the two stars in aa  dor have been determined from these new @xmath0 light curves which differ only a little from those determined earlier , but they are defined more precisely .",
    "these results together with the published orbital parameters from hhh and rw provide new determinations of the astrophysical parameters with an adopted range of primary star mass .",
    "these results are compatible with the theoretical evolution models for binary systems containing hot subdwarf stars published by han _",
    "( 2002 , 2003 ) .",
    "an error in the reflection effect subroutine within the light2 code has been corrected with the result that it agrees with the accepted standard wd code .",
    "analysis of the observed reflection effect demonstrates significant departures within some passbands from an idealised albedo of unity for the heated hemisphere of the secondary star , but the overall bolometric value is most likely close to unity .",
    "it is suggested that further theoretical work should be done on modelling the reflection effect in these types of binaries containing stars with very different effective temperatures .",
