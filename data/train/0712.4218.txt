    "the physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) has been the central focus of high - energy phenomenology for more than three decades . many proposals , including supersymmetry , technicolor , little higgs , and extra dimensions ,",
    "have been made and studied thoroughly in the literature , tests are soon to be made at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "one of the earliest proposals , the left - right symmetric model ( lrsm ) , was motivated by the hypothesis that parity is a perfect symmetry at high - energy , and is broken spontaneously at low - energy due to the asymmetric vacuum  @xcite .",
    "asymptotic restoration of parity has a definite aesthetic appeal  @xcite .",
    "the model has a number of additional attractive features , including a natural explanation of weak hyper - charge in terms of baryon and lepton numbers , existence of right - handed neutrinos and entailed seesaw mechanism for neutrino masses , possibility of spontaneous cp ( charge - conjugation - parity ) violation , and natural solution for the strong cp problem .",
    "the model can be constrained strongly by low - energy physics and predicts clear signatures at colliders .",
    "it so far remains a decent possibility for new physics .",
    "the lrsm is best constrained at low - energy by flavor - violating mixing and decays , particularly cp violating observables . in making theoretical predictions ,",
    "the major uncertainty comes from the unknown right - handed quark mixing matrix , similar in spirit to that of the left - handed quark cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) mixing .",
    "the new mixing is a unitary matrix , depending on 9 real parameters : 6 cp violation phases and 3 rotational angles .",
    "all are physical after the left - handed ckm mixing is rotated into a standard 4-parameter form .",
    "historically , two special cp violation scenarios in lrsm have been considered .",
    "the first one ,  the manifest left - right symmetry \" , assumes that there is no spontaneous cp violation i.e. all higgs vacuum expectation values ( vev s ) are real .",
    "then the quark mass matrices are hermitian , and the left- and right - handed quark mixings become identical , modulo the sign uncertainty of the elements from negative quark masses .",
    "the second scenario ,  pseudomanifest left - right symmetry \" , assumes that the cp violation comes entirely from spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) of the vacuum and all yukawa couplings are real @xcite . here",
    "the quark mass matrices are complex and symmetric , implying that the right - handed quark mixing is related to the complex conjugate of the ckm matrix multiplied by additional cp phases .",
    "there are few studies of the model with general cp violations in the literature @xcite .",
    "it has been noted that there are problems with both manifest and pseudo - manifest scenarios .",
    "the manifest lrsm with real potential and vev s always provides more minimization conditions than the number of vev s , thus has a fine - tuning problem . in any case , in the non - suspersymmetric lrsm , the assumption of all parameters of the model being real is not technically natural since loop corrections lead to one of the parameters being complex . on the other hand , the pseudo - manifest lrsm , where exact cp is assumed before symmetry breaking and all couplings in the higgs potential",
    "are real , leads in the decoupling limit to either a model with light triplet higgs , which is already excluded by sm precision test , or a two higgs doublet model , which is excluded by experiment due to large tree level flavor - changing neutral current @xcite .",
    "therefore , neither of the two special scenarios can be realistic .",
    "in a recent paper @xcite , we reported a systematic approach to analytically solving the right - handed quark mixing in the minimal lrsm where only the requirement of parity invariance is imposed prior to symmetry breaking , leaving automatically only one cp phase in the higgs potential and one in the yukawa couplings and leading to a theory with both explicit and spontaneous cp violations .",
    "this model therefore falls in - between the above two extreme cases and is free of the problems described above .",
    "our approach is based on the observation that in the absence of any fine tuning , @xmath5 implies that the ratio of the two vev s of the higgs bi - doublet , @xmath6 , is small and is of the order of @xmath7 . in the leading - order in @xmath8",
    ", we find a linear equation for the right - handed quark mixing matrix which can be readily solved .",
    "we present an analytical solution of this equation valid to @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the cabibbo mixing parameter .",
    "the leading right - handed quark mixing is nearly the same as the left - handed ckm matrix , except for additional phases which are fixed by @xmath8 , spontaneous cp phase @xmath11 , and the quark masses .",
    "our work is similar in spirit to the detailed numerical study of the general cp lrsm made by kiers et al .",
    "@xcite , with the two vev s ratio @xmath12 fixed exactly to @xmath7 .",
    "it is interesting that the gross feature of the right - handed ckm was obtained already in the appendix of that paper , in particular the hierarchical structure of flavor mixing and the magnitude of the dirac cp phase .",
    "however , realistic studies were made numerically for lack of an explicit solution with known precision .",
    "in fact , much of the numerical work of ref .",
    "@xcite goes into solving the right - handed ckm in the presence of 11 input parameters , which must be scanned through using monte carlo to obtain the physical quark masses and the left - handed ckm mixing . because the extensive nature of numerical study , it is difficult to see some of the physics in a clear way , in particular , the interplay between the explicit and spontaneous cp violations in physical observables .",
    "our explicit analytic solution for the right - handed ckm makes extensive analytical studies simple and straightforward .    in this paper , we first give the detailed method obtaining the analytical solution to righthanded quark mixing @xcite . with this explicit right - handed mixing",
    ", we study the neutral kaon and b - meson systems and the neutron electric dipole moment ( edm ) to obtain the lower bound on righthanded @xmath13-boson mass scale .",
    "the neutral kaon mass mixing provides a rigorous lower bound @xmath14 tev , with the use of the new lattice qcd calculations of the four - quark matrix elements and the strange quark mass .",
    "the indirect cp violation @xmath3 receives large contributions from both explicit and spontaneous cp phases , and from both the gauge - boson box diagram and flavor - changing neutral higgs ( fcnh ) .",
    "there are strong cancelations among all the contributions , which in turn constrain severely the relation among the spontaneous cp phase , @xmath15 , and fcnh mass @xmath16 .",
    "we use the cancelation condition to fix the spontaneous cp phase , which is then used to predict the neutron edm in terms of the model parameters . using the experimental bound on the edm ,",
    "we obtain a strong lower bound on @xmath15 , which can be improved with better calculations of the hadronic matrix elements and more precise experimental data .",
    "furthermore , we study implications of direct cp violation in @xmath17 and @xmath18 decays . in the former case , a strong lower bound on @xmath15",
    "is obtained under the factorization assumption for the four - quark matrix elements .",
    "the cp violating observables in the kaon and b systems and the neutron edm provide competitive or even stronger bounds than the well - known kaon mass mixing .",
    "we also present a detailed study of the higgs sector in the presence of the spontaneous cp phase , including the mass spectrum , the neutral and charged couplings to the quarks , and the bound on the fcnh mass .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first briefly introduce the minimal lrsm in sec .",
    "ii . in sec .",
    "iii , we report our method in solving for the righthanded ckm matrix in the scenario of generic cp violation , including both spontaneous and explicit phases as is the case with only parity invariance . in sec .",

    "v , we explore the well - known neutral kaon mass difference to find out updated constraints on the right - handed @xmath13 mass and the fcnh mass .",
    "we also consider similar constraints from the neutral b - meson system .",
    "the cp violations in various processes are discussed in sec .",
    "vi , including @xmath3 , @xmath4 , neutron edm and cp asymmetry in @xmath19 , to constrain the mass of @xmath0 and the spontaneous cp phase @xmath11 .",
    "we find that they place consistently strong lower bounds on @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "we conclude the paper in sec .",
    "vii , with a table summarizing various constraint on the right - handed scales .",
    "the minimal lrsm is based on the gauge group @xmath20 .",
    "parity is assumed to be a good symmetry at the lagrangian density level , and is broken spontaneously by vev s of higgs fields .",
    "the electric charge formula can be written as a generalized gell - mann - nishijima formula including the third component of the right - handed isospin , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , and the difference between baryon and lepton numbers  @xcite , @xmath23 this in turn gives an explicit explanation for the standard model @xmath24-hypercharge in terms of physical quantum numbers rather than an arbitrarily adjustable quantum number @xmath25 .    in the matter sector ,",
    "the left - handed fermions form fundamental representations of the @xmath26 gauge group , while right - handed ones form the representations of the @xmath27 gauge group .",
    "the right - handed neutrinos are introduced automatically so that the right - handed leptons also form doublets under @xmath27 @xmath28 where the quantum numbers are those of the above gauge groups . from these , we can easily write down the gauge - coupled lagrangian density for fermions , @xmath29 where the index @xmath30 labels fermion generation with all the fields being in flavor eigenstates . @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the gauge fields associated with the above gauge groups , with corresponding couplings @xmath33 and @xmath34 . @xmath35 are pauli matrices for isospins .",
    "the right - handed currents couple to the gauge bosons @xmath0 in a way symmetric to the left - handed counterparts .",
    "the higgs sector contains a bidoublet @xmath36 , belonging to the @xmath37 representation of the gauge group , which is the left - right symmetric version of the sm higgs doublet and two triplets @xmath38 belonging to @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively , @xmath41 the higgs boson s kinetic energy and coupling to the gauge fields are canonical , @xmath42   + { \\rm tr}[(d_\\mu",

    ", we use the vev s of neutral higgs fields to break the gauge symmetry .",
    "the symmetry group @xmath44 is first broken to @xmath45 by the vev @xmath46 at tev or multi - tev scale .",
    "then electroweak symmetry breaking is induced by the vev s of @xmath36 . with a generic higgs potential , all the neutral components of the higgs get vev s , @xmath47 where there are 4 neutral complex components and so generically 4 phases . at first",
    "it appears that 3 of them can be eliminated through gauge symmetry because we have 3 generators , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath48 , commuting with the electromagnetic charge operator @xmath49 . in reality , however , we can eliminate only 2 . if the transformation parameters associated with the above 3 operators are @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , the higgs fields transform as , @xmath53 this leads a transformation of the vev phases , @xmath54 it is clear that there are two independent combinations of transformation parameters , allowing removing two phases only .",
    "conventionally the phases of @xmath55 and @xmath56 are set to zero , and thus the general form of higgs vev s is simplified to @xmath57 if one chooses @xmath58 , the only remaining phase @xmath11 is physically relevant .",
    "since the bidoublet @xmath36 transforms non - trivially under both @xmath26 and @xmath27 , the gauge bosons @xmath59 and @xmath0 are not the mass eigenstates after ssb . from ( [ f1 ] )",
    "we get the @xmath13-boson mass matrix , @xmath60 where @xmath61 , and @xmath62 by parity .",
    "since @xmath63 is at most on the order of the left - handed neutrino masses and @xmath64 on the sm scale , @xmath65 , and we can neglect @xmath66 in eq .",
    "( [ f2 ] ) .",
    "the mass matrix can be diagonalized by a unitary transformation @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are mass eigenstates ( 1 and 2 subscripts shall not be confused with the cartesian components of the isospins ) , with masses @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "the parameters @xmath72 and @xmath73 are related to the cp phase @xmath11 and the masses of @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath55 and @xmath76 @xmath77 where again @xmath78 .",
    "if there is no cancelation in generating quark masses , @xmath8 has a natural size @xmath7 , and thus @xmath72 is suppressed by both @xmath79 and @xmath7 and is smaller than @xmath80 , which is much smaller than the current experimental bound @xmath81 .",
    "even so this tiny mixing will be the dominating contribution to the neutron edm , as we will discuss below . in terms of the mass eigenstates ,",
    "the charged current couplings in the quark sector are @xmath82 the above expression is in quark flavor basis . in the next section , we will consider the quark mass basis in which it will be modified by the ckm mixing matrices .",
    "in this section , we will focus on the quark sector , solving for the right - handed quark mixing matrix compatible with the observed quark masses and the left - handed mixing .",
    "the solution is valid in the general cp violation scenario in which both explicit and spontaneous cp breakings are allowed .",
    "the only significant assumption we will make is that bidoublet higgs vev s and related yukawa couplings have a hierarchical structure and there is no large cancelation in generating quark masses , and the solution can be made in a systematic expansion of the relevant small parameter .",

    "it is present because the eigenvalues of a hermitian matrix can either be positive or negative , and by convention we take all @xmath98 positive . in this basis",
    ", @xmath99 is not diagonal and is related to @xmath100 via left- and right - handed ckm rotations . since the phase factor @xmath101 in @xmath99 is generically non - zero , @xmath102 .",

    "the @xmath89 matrix , however , will be subjected to a unitary transformation and remains hermitian .",
    "second , after the transformation , all parameters in the unitary matrix @xmath108 must be physical , including 3 rotations and 6 cp - violating phases .    to make further progress",

    "there are a total of 9 equations in the above expression , which is just enough to solve 9 parameters in @xmath110 .",
    "it is interesting to note that if there is no spontaneous cp violation , @xmath112 , we recover the solution @xmath113 , in which @xmath114 is the sign matrix for down - type quark masses .",
    "this is just the manifest lrs case .",
    "the above linear equations can be readily solved utilizing the hierarchy between down - type quark masses .",
    "we find an analytical expression for @xmath108 up to order of @xmath115 , where @xmath73 is sine of cabibbo angle .",
    "we begin directly from ( [ a19 ] ) and the left side is anti - hermitian , and we can write it explicitly @xmath116 where we have used @xmath117 . the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ a19 ] ) depends on the physical quark masses , the standard ckm matrix , and the spontaneous cp violation parameter @xmath118 .",

    "a few remarks about the above result are in order .",
    "first , the hierarchical structure of the right - handed mixing is similar to that of the left - handed ckm , namely 1 - 2 mixing is of order @xmath73 , 1 - 3 order @xmath153 and 2 - 3 order @xmath154 .",
    "second , every element now has a substantial cp phase .",
    "when @xmath155 is of order 1 , the elements involving the first two families have cp phases of order @xmath73 , and the phases involving the third family are of order @xmath156 .",
    "these phases are all related to the single spontaneous cp - violating phase @xmath11 , and generate rich phenomenology for @xmath157 and @xmath158 meson systems as well as the neutron edm .",
    "finally , from ( [ vr ] ) and ( [ theta ] ) , it is clear that the final solution is a function of sign bi - products @xmath159 .",
    "we can always fix one of them , say @xmath160 , to be positive , then we are left with @xmath161 distinct sectors .",
    "the actual physical choice must be determined by phenomenology , as we will illustrate in the following sections .",
    "in this section , we discuss several issues related to the higgs sector .",
    "in particular , we consider the possibility of spontaneous cp violation from the higgs potential , the mass spectrum of the higgs bosons , and the higgs couplings to the quark sector .",
