    "resonances are used in the creation of ultracold polar molecules @xcite and are required to observe heteronuclear efimov trimer states @xcite .",
    "they also allow the investigation of many interesting many - body phenomena in ultracold mixtures @xcite . since their first observation @xcite , interspecies feshbach resonances have been studied in many experiments .",
    "feshbach resonances in bose - fermi mixtures give rise to a rich palette of physical phenomena @xcite .",
    "the bose - fermi mixture of @xmath4li+na @xcite has so far mainly been used to efficiently prepare a degenerate fermi gas of @xmath4li . in combination with a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) of na , this mixture is a candidate to show boson mediated interactions between fermions @xcite .",
    "interspecies feshbach resonances have not been utilized in @xmath4li+na , despite of the early experimental observation of three resonances @xcite .",
    "we have created an ultracold @xmath4li+na mixture in different spin - state combinations and searched for interspecies feshbach resonances at magnetic fields of up to 2050 g . the observed 26 interspecies feshbach resonances have been assigned using the asymptotic bound - state model ( abm ) @xcite .",
    "most of the resonances found are of @xmath2-wave character , i.e.  caused by molecular states with rotational angular momentum @xmath5=2 , coupled via the weak magnetic dipole interaction to the @xmath6-wave continuum .",
    "the observed s - wave resonances give rise to very weak loss features , even weaker than some of the @xmath2-wave resonances , in agreement with a coupled - channel calculation based on the full interaction potentials .",
    "we show that the previous assignment of ref.@xcite is incorrect , and as a result also the predictions of feshbach resonances and scattering lengths in ref.@xcite .",
    "li and @xmath1na .",
    "the indicated labeling of the different zeeman levels is used throughout the paper.[zeeman],width=321 ]    this paper is organized as follows . in sec.[exp ] we outline our experimental procedure for the preparation of an ultracold @xmath4li+na mixture ( sec.[prep ] ) , the feshbach spectroscopy measurements ( sec.[fspec ] ) , and additional experiments providing information about sign and magnitude of the interspecies singlet and triplet scattering lengths ( sec.[add ] ) . in sec.[theory ] we give an assignment of the observed resonances using abm ( sec.[abm ] ) .",
    "we compare the observed resonance positions with a coupled - channel calculation ( sec.[cc ] ) using modified interaction potentials .",
    "this results in the determination of the resonance widths and background scattering lengths , latter in good agreement with the experimental observations . in sec.[7lina ] we apply these potentials to the isotopologue @xmath3li+na and give prospects of possible feshbach resonances in this bose - bose mixture .",

    "our experimental procedure to obtain an ultracold @xmath4li+na mixture is based on the strategy of ref.@xcite . in short , we start with a double species magneto - optical trap and load the atoms into a cloverleaf ioffe - pritchard magnetic trap , after optically spin - polarizing both li and na .",

    "a similar scheme is applied for li .",
    "specifically , for preparation of the @xmath19 state we omit the @xmath20 mw rap and directly do the rf transfer @xmath8@xmath9@xmath21@xmath9@xmath22@xmath9@xmath19 .",
    "it is important to note that in all spin channels the lifetime of the resulting mixtures is longer than 10s .      for the feshbach spectroscopy , we ramp the magnetic field a few gauss below the resonance , where the system is allowed to thermalize for 0.5s .",
    "subsequently , we switch the magnetic field to the desired value , wait for a hold time ranging from 20ms to 2s such that on resonance a detectable number of li atoms is still left , which prevents systematic errors due to saturation effects .",
    "na and li are imaged for different time of flights after ramping down to zero magnetic field . for applying magnetic fields below 1200 g ,",
    "the antibias coils of the cloverleaf trap , which are in helmholtz configuration , are sufficient .",
    "higher magnetic fields are reached adding the pinch coils of the cloverleaf trap with a magnetic field inhomogeneity of at most 10 mg over the sample , not being a limitation to our feshbach spectroscopy .",

    "we perform measurements to obtain information about the sign and magnitude of the interspecies scattering length @xmath34 .",
    "this will later serve as guidance for the abm resonance assignment by restricting the @xmath6-wave bound state energy .    to determine the absolute value of the triplet scattering length @xmath35 experimentally , we excite the dipole mode in the odt with high amplitude @xmath36 m .",
    "in the subsequent oscillation , the sodium and lithium clouds both having a @xmath37-radius of @xmath38 m penetrate each other at the frequency @xmath39 .",
    "after an interspecies scattering event , the colliding atoms do not contribute to the coherent oscillation signal any more .",

    "the sodium having a chemical potential of @xmath50nk experiences a @xmath51 density modulation by the @xmath52nk deep lattice , which is negligible compared to the overall atom number fluctuations . due to",
    "the high associated momentum in the lattice with gap @xmath53khz , in an interspecies collision each lithium atom in the second band will relax to the first band due to energy and momentum conservation .",
    "thus , the rate of this process is given by @xmath54 where the relative velocity @xmath55 of li and na is mainly given by the momentum of the lithium atoms due to their confinement in the lattice wells .",
    "we monitor the dynamics of this process by employing the band - mapping technique @xcite .",
    "for a li@xmath10+na@xmath10 mixture , which has both singlet and triplet character , we obtain @xmath56 .",
    "the sign of the scattering lenght can be infered by comparing the in - situ density profiles of an ultracold lithium cloud with and without a sodium background . for that purpose ,",
    "we remove the sodium atoms with a resonant light pulse after evaporative cooling of the mixture in the odt .",
    "as can be calculated with the absolute value of the scattering length obtained above , this process leads to a lithium atom loss of less than 1% , a value below our typical atom number fluctuation .",
    "the consecutively observed broadening of the lithium density profile clearly indicates an attractive interspecies interaction @xmath57 .",
    "an insight into the difference between singlet and triplet scattering length @xmath58 and @xmath59 is provided by measuring the two - body loss rate due to spin - exchange collisions .",
    "these processes induce changes of the magnetic quantum numbers @xmath60 and @xmath61 of the two colliding atoms while leaving the total @xmath62 constant . using fermi s golden rule",
    ", these processes occur at a rate @xcite @xmath63 here , @xmath15 denotes the reduced mass and @xmath64 the energy difference between initial state @xmath65 and final state @xmath66 .",
    "the term @xmath67 , with @xmath68 being the electron spin operator of atom 1,2 , induces the spin exchange , i.e. lowers the spin of atom 1  while raising the spin of atom  2 and vice versa .",
    "eq.([eq : diff ] ) is exact in the limit of vanishing coupling strength of the magnetic dipole and hyperfine interactions . in its derivation ,",
    "the singlet and triplet potentials @xmath69 and @xmath70 are simply replaced by their respective scattering lengths .",
    "thus the potentially important effects of magnetic dipoles and hyperfine structure as well as the variation of @xmath71 with the internuclear distance @xmath72 are neglected , an effect which we will adress below using a cc calculation .",
    "experimentally , we choose @xmath73 , which has the only energetically possible decay channel with equal @xmath74 to the state @xmath75 .",
    "the energy gain @xmath64 is given by the breit - rabi formula and by taking also the small magnetic field dependence of @xmath71 into account , one sees that the spin exchange rate is maximized for @xmath76 g .",
    "therefore , @xmath77 is mapped out for @xmath78 g to @xmath79 g and we fit the observed maximum of the loss rate to obtain @xmath80 . with @xmath81 , using eq.([eq : diff ] ) we finally get @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the bohr radius . due to the simplifications mentioned above , this result can only be considered an estimate , thus we performed a cc calculation with fixed triplet scattering length @xmath84 . by varying the singlet scattering length @xmath58 ,",
    "the experimentally observed spin exchange rate is theoretically obtained for @xmath85 , in excellent agreement with the value from the approximate formula eq.([eq : diff ] ) .    for all experimental results presented above",
    ", the statistical errors in the scattering length values are given by the relative uncertainties in determination of @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) , atom numbers @xmath88 and @xmath42 ( @xmath89 ) , temperature @xmath90 ( @xmath89 ) and condensate fraction ( @xmath91 ) @xcite .",
    "feshbach resonances occur when molecular states are resonant with two scattering atoms . for li and na atoms in the ground state @xmath92 the molecular states are related to the least - bound rovibrational levels of the singlet  and triplet  born - oppenheimer potentials .",
    "their rovibrational levels are labeled by the vibrational and rotational angular momentum quantum numbers @xmath55 and @xmath5 as well as the space - fixed projection @xmath93 of the rotational angular momentum along the magnetic field direction .",
    "the basis @xmath94 for a pair of atoms @xmath95 and @xmath96 describes the remainder of the molecular state , where the fixed atomic quantum numbers @xmath97 for electron and nuclear spin are suppressed in the basis vector for brevity .",
    "the total electron spin of the molecule is given by @xmath98 .",
    "projections are always defined along the magnetic field direction . because of the hyperfine interaction it is useful to introduce the coupled basis @xmath99 , in which @xmath100 , and @xmath101 is its projection .",
    "we note that @xmath102 .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian conserves the total angular momentum @xmath103 at zero magnetic field , and always conserves its projection @xmath104 .",
    "we focus on ultra - cold collisions , with temperatures well below the @xmath24-wave centrifugal barrier .",
    "hence , in general only @xmath6-wave collisions need to be considered , although @xmath24-wave scattering may be enhanced at @xmath24-wave resonances .",
    "however , @xmath5=2 molecular states can induce feshbach resonances in the @xmath6-wave channels , since distinct angular momentum states are coupled via the weak magnetic dipole spin - spin interaction .",
    "this anisotropic interaction does not conserve the quantum numbers @xmath5 and @xmath93 , and gives rise to the selection rules @xmath105 and  2 , and @xmath106 .",
    "the number of @xmath107 states for a given @xmath26 is much larger than for @xmath108 , therefore it gives rise to many more possible @xmath2- than @xmath6-wave resonances .",
    "note that the @xmath2-wave resonances show up as resonances in the @xmath6-wave scattering length , and therefore in practice are not different from direct @xmath6-wave feshbach resonances .",
    "we have applied the asymptotic bound - state model ( abm ) @xcite , which provides a powerful yet computational light description of the near threshold molecular spectrum , in order to assign the observed feshbach resonances . by using the binding energies of the rovibrational states and the wavefunction overlap between singlet and triplet states as fit parameters",
    "it circumvents the need of detailed knowledge on the molecular potentials and wavefunctions .",
    "the abm is very suitable to guide both experiment and coupled - channel calculations once a few resonances are found .",
    "we define @xmath109 as the crossing point of a molecular state and the atomic threshold . in principle , this differs from the feshbach resonance position because finite coupling between the molecular bound states and the threshold channel shifts the resonance position @xcite .",
    "however , since the observed feshbach resonances are very narrow , these shifts can be neglected .     from abm , showing the molecular states @xmath108 ( thick blue ) and 2 ( solid red ) states , and the observed @xmath6- ( large blue ) and @xmath2-wave ( small red ) feshbach resonances as filled circles .",

    "we note that many @xmath6- and @xmath2-wave feshbach resonances are not observed in the investigated magnetic field range , consistent with the findings of the coupled - channel calculation revealing that their widths are below the detection limit of our apparatus ( see section [ cc ] ) .",
    "since our measured resonance spectra contain both @xmath6- and @xmath2-wave resonances , we need in principle six abm parameters : the four binding energies @xmath122 and overlap parameters @xmath123 , where latter can differ for @xmath108 and @xmath107 .",
    "however , since the corresponding bound states are weakly - bound and thus have a large spatial extent , the rotational splittings @xmath124 between the @xmath108 and @xmath107 bound states are approximately equal for singlet and triplet states , i.e. @xmath125 .",
    "moreover , we assume that the overlap parameters @xmath123 for @xmath108 and @xmath107 waves are equal . since we have mostly resonances of @xmath2-wave character , we choose the four remaining parameters to be the @xmath2-state binding energies @xmath126 and @xmath127 , the overlap @xmath128 , and the @xmath2-wave rotational shift @xmath129 .",

    "we see that the abm reproduces all but one resonance positions within 1 g , providing very strong evidence of the correctness of our assignment .      guided by the abm results , we performed a coupled - channel calculation that includes the full interaction potentials , to obtain a more thorough description of the feshbach spectrum . to describe the relative motion of two scattering atoms in the coupled system",
    "+  we use the following hamiltonian ( see  e.g.  @xcite ) : @xmath134 where @xmath90 is the operator for the relative kinetic energy of the atoms , @xmath135 is the @xmath136-dependent hyperfine - contact interaction of atom a  and b , and @xmath137 is the magnetic zeeman interaction .",

    "finally , @xmath140 is the weak but non - negligible magnetic dipole spin - spin interaction that includes the second - order spin - orbit interaction .",
    "nevertheless , in the fitting procedure the latter extension turned out to be insignificant for the present data set of feshbach resonances for lina .",
    "@xmath140 depends on the orientation of the electron spin with respect to the internuclear axis @xmath141 as well as the internuclear separation and therefore couples and thus mixes different partial waves @xmath142 .",
    "the atomic constants are taken from ref.@xcite , the atomic masses of li and na from ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the born - oppenheimer potentials are introduced as power expansions with a non - linear function of internuclear separation @xmath136 , and are defined in an accompanying paper @xcite .",
    "they are derived from a fit to all measured feshbach resonances and recently measured fourier spectroscopy data of more deeply bound rovibrational levels of the  potential as presented in the same paper @xcite .",
    "the fit is split into two parts because of the very different kinds of data .",
    "feshbach resonances depend strongly on hyperfine and zeeman interaction , whereas deeply bound rovibrational levels from fourier spectroscopy belong to almost uncoupled singlet and triplet states .",
    "despite the fact that experimentally most feshbach resonances are detected via three - body loss , the coupled - channel calculation determines their position from the two - body resonance . for the fit of the feshbach resonances ,",
    "the slope of the short range branch of both potentials is varied first only for @xmath107 , because of the large number of observed @xmath2-wave resonances .",
    "the @xmath6-wave resonances are assigned only after a good model for the @xmath2-wave resonances is obtained . with this result",
    "we predict where @xmath6-wave resonances could occur and found three in our set of observations about 12 g off the predictions .",
    "this tells immediately that the rotational splitting is not yet correctly described by the applied long range function , which is introduced by dispersion coefficients @xmath117 , @xmath143 and @xmath144 as reported from theory by ref.@xcite .",
    "because we have only few data from the @xmath6-wave feshbach resonances , a fit of all three dispersion parameters would be meaningless as it leads to strongly correlated values .",
    "we select @xmath117 for variation . from preliminary potentials we find that the outer turning points of the relevant rovibrational levels will lie around 32@xmath83 and thus the influence of the higher order terms is much less than that of @xmath117 .",
    "the fits yield  a  @xmath117 value which is 2.2% smaller than the theoretically predicted one @xcite .",
    "this is roughly twice the uncertainty expected from that calculation .",
    "we do not interpret our finding as a deviation because of the correlation to the higher order terms which we keep constant .",
    "as described in ref.@xcite the fit routine runs iteratively through the above mentioned two parts . with the result of the feshbach fit",
    ", the born - oppenheimer potentials can predict the position of the uncoupled least bound singlet and triplet levels .",
    "they are used in the second part of the fit together with all deeply bound rovibrational levels to obtain potentials getting an improved description of feshbach and spectroscopy data .",
    "then the separated feshbach fit is started again and later with this new result the combined spectroscopy fit .",
    "only few iterations are needed for convergence . with the coupled - channel calculation we can select from the many possible feshbach resonances ( see fig.[overview ] ) the ones which are broad enough to become detectable in the present experimental setup , i.e. with @xmath145 mg .",
    "this selection was confirmed by the additional observations of the resonances at 800.9 g and 1700.4 g , which proves the predictive power of our scenario . in total , all theoretically predicted @xmath146 resonances with @xmath147 mg were experimentally observed , whereas for @xmath148 no further systematics were done after the successful resonance assignment .",
    "c c c & @xmath114 & @xmath115 +   + @xmath34(@xmath83 ) & -73(8 ) & -76(5 ) + @xmath149(ghz ) & -9.3838(50 ) & -9.35335(50 ) + @xmath150(ghz ) & -5.95634(40 ) & -5.85180(30 ) +    the results of the coupled - channel calculation in terms of the feshbach resonance position @xmath151 and width  @xmath29 , defined as the separation of field positions between the peak and the zero crossing of the scattering length , are given in table  [ frlist ] .",
    "all resonances are modeled well within the experimental uncertainty .",
    "the most striking result is that the @xmath6-wave resonance widths do not exceed 0.1 mg , while the @xmath2-wave widths can reach 10 mg .",
    "for the two resonances of asymptote @xmath152 no widths are given , because the resonances are significantly influenced by inelastic decay channels .",
    "thus the calculated functional form of the scattering lenght is not described by the normally assumed mathematical form as it does not necessarily show a zero crossing at all .",
    "this might also explain why in the abm fit these two resonances show the largest deviation .    from the improved @xmath153 and @xmath154 potentials",
    "the background scattering lengths can be extracted , as well as the binding energies of the least bound states , whose values are given in table  [ scatteringlengthlist ] .",
    "we notice that both abm triplet values deviate less than 1mhz from those obtained from the full interaction potentials , while the @xmath2-state singlet value agrees within 7mhz .",
    "the scattering length values , which have been derived from the results of the coupled - channel calculation with the feshbach resonance spectrum as input , are in perfect agreement with the independently obtained experimental results @xmath155 and @xmath156 .",
    "it is important to note that the singlet and triplet scattering lengths are nearly equal , which is intimately linked to the narrow widths of the feshbach resonances arising due to a combination of factors : first , the singlet and triplet interaction potentials are far from being resonant , indicated by their scattering lengths which are of the same order as the van der waals length @xmath157 , where @xmath15 denotes the reduced mass .",
    "second , the effective coupling between singlet and triplet states is very small , indicated by @xmath158 .",
    "a similar situation can be found in homonuclear @xmath159rb @xcite , where the narrowness of the feshbach resonances and the smallness of the loss rates can be traced back to non - resonant and similar values of @xmath58 and @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "li+na in the energetically lowest spin channel , derived from the interaction potentials .",
    "the spectrum shows much broader @xmath6-wave feshbach resonances than found in @xmath4li+na , most notably a 5.4 g broad resonance around 1220 g .",
    "[ scat_7li],width=321 ]    the lack of a broad @xmath6-wave feshbach resonance to tune the interaction in ultracold @xmath4li+na , has motivated us to consider the isotopologue bose - bose @xmath3li+na mixture . from the improved interaction potentials obtained for @xmath4li+na ,",
    "predictions of scattering lengths and possible feshbach resonances in @xmath3li+na can be made within the born - oppenheimer approximation .",
    "fig.[scat_7li ] shows the predicted scattering length of the energetically lowest spin channel of @xmath3li+na as an example . here",
    "much broader feshbach resonances are present than in @xmath4li+na , including a 5.4 g broad resonance around 1220 g .",
    "we estimate that the accuracy of the feshbach resonance prediction to be better than 50 g , keeping the overall structure and width of the resonances as given in fig.[scat_7li ] .",
    "the main uncertainty of these predictions originates from the insufficiently characterized well depth of the triplet potential @xcite .",
    "the singlet and triplet scattering lengths are predicted to be around @xmath160 and @xmath161 , respectively .",
    "we have observed 26 interspecies feshbach resonances in ultracold @xmath4li+na , consisting of 3 @xmath6- and 23 @xmath2-wave resonances .",
    "the broadest resonance has a width of 10 mg , which practically limits the tunability of the interaction by a magnetic field . on basis of our extensive feshbach spectra and new fourier",
    "spectroscopy data @xcite the interaction potentials have been improved , leading to the scattering lengths @xmath162 and @xmath163 . within the mutual uncertainties ,",
    "they show very good agreement with our experimental findings both in sign and magnitude , where the latter was obtained via an oscillation measurement .",
    "the relatively large absolute value of the triplet scattering length explains the efficient sympathetic cooling observed in ref.@xcite .",
    "moreover , the experimentally measured long lifetimes of different spin mixtures are explained by the small difference of @xmath58 and @xmath59 , which we also confirm quantitatively .",
    "the scattering lengths determined in this study show still fairly large errors ( see table [ scatteringlengthlist ] ) , which result from the uncertainty in the long range function or more explicitly from the uncertainty in @xmath117 due to high correlation between the dispersion coefficients .",
    "one could gain information by measuring @xmath6-wave resonances which have significant singlet character , as the ones reported here are of strong triplet character only .",
    "examples of such resonances are expected to be at 2981(3)g for the entrance channels @xmath111 and @xmath164 and at 3137(3)g for @xmath111 and will show widths around 10 mg thus similar to the broadest observed @xmath2-wave resonances .",
    "but such high fields are not reachable in the present experimental setup .",
    "the lack of data on the triplet potential could be overcome by two - color photo - association experiments ending in deeply bound triplet levels .",
    "for such an experiment , feshbach molecules could be prepared via the broadest @xmath2-wave resonances which have strong triplet character .",
    "this association process should still be possible for resonances having a width larger than 1 mg @xcite .",
