    "it has been shown that simultaneously for each codebook the same error exponent can be achieved as the random coding exponent of this codebook alone .",
    "this theorem is used in @xcite to give an achievable error exponent for joint source - channel coding ( jscc ) .    here , the mentioned results of @xcite are generalized to ( discrete memoryless ) multiple access channels ( macs ) .",
