    "something similar is true of nature .",
    "although the world looks to our senses as if it has an infinite amount of resolution in both space and time , in fact a finite - sized physical system with a finite energy has only a finite amount of distinguishable detail and this detail changes at only a finite rate  @xcite .",
    "the finite character of the states of physical systems came as a great surprise when it became apparent at the start of the twentieth century .",
    "the revolution was started by max planck in 1900 when he found that he had to introduce a new constant into physics in order to understand the thermodynamics of electromagnetic radiation in a cavity . the new constant fixed the statistical mechanical analysis , but it did so by making the count of distinct possible states finite .",
    "planck s constant has a particularly simple interpretation in classical statistical mechanics .",
    "there , the number of microscopic ways a system can realize a macroscopic state is taken to be proportional to the volume in _ phase space _",
    "( i.e. , position / momentum space ) of states consistent with the parameters that define the macroscopic state . in units where planck s constant is one , the phase space volume becomes the actual finite count of distinct states .",
    "planck s constant is the fundamental grain size in phase space , representing one state .",
    "although planck s constant was initially introduced to fix statistical mechanics , a new dynamical theory also grew from this beginning .",
    "the resulting quantum mechanics established new rules for describing the microscopic dynamics of physical systems .",
    "the qm rules were , of course , constructed so that the well established rules of classical mechanics would be recovered as a limiting case .",
    "the continuous equations of motion in cm correspond to the limit in which planck s `` fundamental grain size in phase space '' goes to zero . in this limit",
    ", a finite - sized physical system has an _ infinite _ number of distinguishable states and passes through an infinite subset of these states in a finite amount of time .",
    "even though an actual finite - sized physical system has only a finite number of distinct states and a finite rate of state change , if these finite numbers are large enough ( as they would normally be in a macroscopic system ) the motion is well approximated by the continuous cm equations .",
    "the finite - state and finite - rate character of physical systems make classical finite state models of fundamental interest in physics .",
    "this is because classical models are easier to understand and simulate than quantum models .    in statistical mechanics , classical finite - state lattice systems",

    ".    we might hope to similarly gain insight by studying classical special cases of quantum _ dynamics_. any such classical special case must ( like any other finite physical system ) necessarily have only a finite number of distinct states .",
    "the most common classical finite - state models of physical dynamics are numerical approximations of continuum models .",
    "these are not good candidates to be special cases of microscopic physical dynamics , though , because in this case it is the theoretical continuum model that has realistic physical characteristics , not its truncated and rounded - off finite - state realization  @xcite .",
    "the best candidates for exact special cases are lattice dynamics generalizations of classical lattice gases .",
    "these are lattice models with exact finite - state conservation laws , that at large scales can exhibit not only realistic thermodynamic behavior but also realistic classical mechanical behavior such as wave propagation and fluid dynamics  @xcite .",
    "these models have been used to simulate physical dynamics  @xcite but have not previously been studied as classical special cases of quantum dynamics .",
    "any invertible classical logic operation can be implemented as a qm unitary dynamics , and so can any composition of such operations .",
    "since there are additional operations needed to implement an arbitrary qm unitary dynamics  @xcite , classical finite - state dynamics is logically a proper subset of quantum dynamics .    before the advent of invertible models of computation  @xcite and qm models of computation  @xcite it was nt obvious that , from a logical standpoint , a classical dynamics could be regarded as a special case of quantum dynamics .",
    "historically , the viewpoint had been that classical dynamics is a purely macroscopic concept , relevant only in a limit in which quantum effects become negligible .",
    "in retrospect the confusion stems from not considering the possibility of invertible classical finite - state dynamics ",
    "an understandable omission since qm was developed before computer ideas were prevalent , let alone the idea of invertible computation !",
    "we are glossing over a significant issue , though , when we picture classical finite - state dynamics as a composition of unitary operations . in a quantum computer  @xcite",
    ", the structures that switch from one unitary operation to the next are assumed to be macroscopic and classical .",
    "thus it seems that our picture is incomplete since there are unspecified things going on to implement the explicitly time - dependent sequence of unitary operations .",
    "it is helpful to note , though , that if we take the limit of an infinitely large array of finite - state elements going through a simple cycle of unitary operations , we can recover the familiar time - independent equations of continuum qm  @xcite .",
    "thus explicit time dependence at the microscopic scale does not preclude compositions of unitary operations from being equivalent to more traditional time - independent models of physical dynamics .    even if there is nothing essential missing from explicitly time - dependent qm models , it s not clear that they embody what we re looking for here : a classical - quantum correspondence that is so direct that we might hope to interpret the quantities and concepts of quantum dynamics in a simpler classical context .",
    "if we have to traverse a continuum limit in order to make contact with the familiar time - independent quantities and concepts of continuous dynamics , we lose this directness .",
    "much of the simplicity of qm derives from the use of continuous operators .",

    "the motion remains perfectly continuous between integer times , but dynamical parameters ( masses , spring constants , etc . )",

    "to illustrate some issues involved in describing cm dynamics using qm , and how qm concepts look in this classical context , we discuss in this section the simplest examples : non - interacting particle models .",
    "these models are embeddings of an @xmath7 bit shift register .",
    "we start with the case where all bits of the shift register are 0 s except for a single 1 ( figure  [ fig.register]a ) . at each discrete time step",
    "the register is circularly shifted one position to the right : the 1 hops to the next position to the right , and if it is in the rightmost position it hops to the first position .      the discrete - shift dynamics can be embedded into a continuous shift ( figure  [ fig.register]b ) .",
    "we replace the register with a one - dimensional space , and the 1 by a free particle moving to the right at a constant speed @xmath8 .",
    "the space is periodic , so that when the particle exits at one end , it reappears at the other end .",
    "if the length of the space is @xmath9 , then we take our unit of distance to be @xmath10 and our unit of time to be @xmath11 .",
    "the particle is started at an integer coordinate , moving to the right at speed @xmath8 .",
    "it will subsequently always be found at one of the @xmath7 integer coordinates at any integer time . interpreting the presence or absence of a particle at a position as a 1 or a 0",
    ", the continuous system reproduces the discrete - shift dynamics at integer times .",
    "conversely , the time evolution of the continuous system can be exactly predicted at integer times by evolving the discrete - shift system .",
    "this implies that the continuous system , with a finite set of allowed integer - time states , effectively has no more distinct states than the finite - state system . from the point of view of the discrete - shift dynamics",
    "intermediate states are _ fictitious _ states that have been added in order to construct a continuous embedding .    in this example , as in the other finitary cm examples we will consider , the finite subset of the continuous state set that can be visited by the dynamics at integer times is known when the system is defined and does nt change with time .",
    "periodic discreteness makes the details of the fictitious states between integer times irrelevant for predicting the long - term behavior of the dynamics .",
    "given finite energy a qm particle in a box can be completely described using only a finite set of distinct states .",
    "one could regard the cm embedding of the shift register example above as a semiclassical analog of a qm particle in a box , illustrating how a system with a dynamics that obeys a continuous translational symmetry can be made to act like a finite state system by restricting the set of allowed initial states in a manner that is conserved at integer times by the dynamics .",
    "we can make this more than an analogy by recasting the continuous cm `` particle in a box '' dynamics in qm language .",
    "consider a free massless relativistic particle in a one dimensional periodic box .",
    "if we ignore for a moment that the particle can travel both left and right we can take the hamiltonian to be @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the usual momentum operator and @xmath3 is the speed of light .",
    "the schrdinger equation becomes @xmath14 this has the solution @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the initial state of @xmath17 at @xmath18 and can be specified arbitrarily .",
    "this dynamics just shifts whatever state we start with uniformly to the right at speed @xmath3 .",
    "now we assume that this system has finite energy . in qm , this assumption imposes constraints on the allowed initial states .",
    "the conventional way to analyze this for a qm particle in a box is to describe the particle s position in terms of momentum eigenstates : only waves that fit an integer number of wavelengths across the width of the box are allowed by the boundary conditions .",
    "since momentum eigenstates with higher spatial frequencies correspond to higher energies , a finite maximum energy eigenstate only allows us to use a finite number of frequency components .",
    "the qm average energy corresponds to the classical energy , and so the natural constraint for a closed classical dynamical system is that the _ average energy _ is bounded ( rather than the maximum energy eigenvalue ) .",
    "we will take the average energy constraint as the starting point for the analysis in this section .",
    "average energy is related to rate of state change  @xcite : for any closed qm system , the average energy @xmath19 ( taking the ground state energy as zero ) gives an achievable bound on the rate and @xmath20 separated in time by an interval @xmath8 depends only on @xmath8 .",
    "] @xmath21 at which the system can pass through a long sequence of the total - system dynamical cycle that an orthogonal change is part of  we omit a factor of @xmath22 on the right side of the inequality .",
    "] of distinct ( i.e. , mutually orthogonal ) states : @xmath23 now suppose the particle is initially very well localized . then the initial wavefunction @xmath16 is sharply peaked at one point and zero everywhere else . under the `` shift '' dynamics , after a short time the sharp peak will have moved enough so that the old and new position states will be distinct ( figure  [ fig.register]c ) .",
    "the more sharply the particle is localized , the sooner the states will be distinct and so the higher the rate of orthogonal change and hence the higher the average energy .",
    "if instead the `` peak '' is spread evenly over the whole box , the shift will never produce a different state and the average energy can be very low .    given a finite average energy @xmath19 there is thus a limit to how sharply the particle can be localized and this determines how many distinct position states are available to the system .",
    "if the width of the box is @xmath9 and there are @xmath7 distinct position states , then the system transitions to a new orthogonal state in the time it takes the pattern to shift a distance of @xmath10 .",
    "thus the rate at which the system passes through orthogonal states is @xmath24 and so , from equation  [ eq.max-rate ] , @xmath7 ca nt be more than @xmath25 .",
    "the maximum number of distinct states is bounded by the energy @xmath19 .",
    "since the average ( classical ) momentum is @xmath26 , this can also be written as @xmath27 .",
    "the unidirectional hamiltonian we ve used here seems unphysical , since a real particle should be able to move in either direction .",
    "the direction should be part of the state , not part of the hamiltonian .",
    "this can easily be fixed .",
    "since the hamiltonian @xmath28 moves the particle uniformly to the right at speed @xmath3 without changing the shape of the wavefunction , clearly the hamiltonian @xmath29 would carry the particle uniformly to the left at speed @xmath3 .",
    "if we make a two component state vector and use the hamiltonian @xmath30 then the particle will travel to the right if we represent it in the first component , and to the left if we represent it in the second component .",
    ", and only negative momentum eigenvalues for motion to the left . ]",
    "if we define @xmath31 then the hamiltonian can be written as @xmath32 .",
    "thus @xmath33 can be interpreted as the operator that reads the sign of the particle direction from the state information .",
    "this is a one - dimensional version of the weyl equation , sometimes also referred to as the massless dirac equation .",
    "@xmath34{figures / ss - gg - comparison } & \\includegraphics[height=1.5in]{figures / pulse - real - imag } \\\\   \\mbox{\\bf ( a ) } & \\mbox{\\bf ( b ) } \\\\ \\end{array}\\ ] ]      in figure  [ fig.register]c , we depicted the wavepacket representing the particle as a square wave . in this section",
    "we discuss the actual shape of the wavepacket needed to achieve the energy bound of section  [ sec.energy-counting ] on the number of distinct states .",
    "if we were just specifying a discrete distribution at integer times and positions , the probabilities needed to reproduce the shift dynamics are obvious : the particle is at some integer position with probability 1 and at other integer positions with probability 0 .",
    "we want to extend this distribution to the continuum .    for continuous positions , the width of the wavepacket represents uncertainty in where exactly the particle would be found if we looked .",
    "since the shape of the wavepacket does nt change as it shifts , we are free to interpret all of the uncertainty as uncertainty in the initial position of the particle .",
    "there is , however , a better way to interpret this .",
    "the shape of the wavepacket is chosen to allow us to represent exactly @xmath7 distinct states , each with the wavepacket centered at an integer coordinate . the uncertainty in particle position blurs distinctions , combining continuum states that would otherwise be distinct .",
    "thus another way to interpret the position uncertainty would be to say that we invented fictitious intermediate positions in order to map a finite - state dynamics onto the continuum , and then we treated the exact value of the position coordinate _ as if it was uncertain _ in order to eliminate the fictitious position information by representing it probabilistically as missing information .",
    "now , if we represented the particle by a square pulse , as in figure  [ fig.register]c , we would be assigning equal probabilities to all fictitious intermediate positions in one region and zero elsewhere , with a sharp transition in between .",
    "the only constraint on the continuous wavefunction , however , is that it should exactly represent the finite - state dynamics when sampled at integer times and positions .",
    "we should therefore choose the wavefunction that includes as little information as possible about fictitious intermediate positions ( i.e. , in keeping with jaynes maximum entropy principle  @xcite , we should choose the wavefunction that is maximally noncommital with regard to missing information ) .",
    "this implies a bound on the fourier spectrum of the wavefunction : spatial frequencies that are needed only to specify details about fictitious intermediate positions should be omitted .    in figure",
    "[ fig.sinc]a we illustrate a probability distribution function based on the cardinal sine function , @xmath35 cardinal sine gets its name as the basis of e.  t.  whittaker s cardinal interpolation function , and it plays a central role in bandlimited sampling theory @xcite .",
    "it is the fourier transform of a finite range of frequency components , all taken with equal weight .",
    "the probability distribution function shown with the solid line is @xmath36 .",
    "this is a normalized distribution that is close to a gaussian ( dotted line ) near the mean , has the value 1 at the point @xmath37 and has the value 0 at every other integer position .",
    "the corresponding amplitude distribution for a particle centered at integer position @xmath38 is @xmath39 times a phase factor .",
    "of course this function also has magnitude one at the center of the distribution , and magnitude zero at all other integer positions .",
    "we can use a weighted sum of such functions to construct any assignment of amplitudes to integer positions .",
    "figure  [ fig.sinc]b shows the real and imaginary parts of the function @xmath40 the set of functions @xmath41 for @xmath38 an integer are all mutually orthogonal : these functions form a complete basis .",
    "we will refer to these states as the _ discrete position basis_.    the discrete position basis states ( and any states constructed out of them ) have a bounded spatial frequency spectrum .",
    "these basis states answer the question we started this section with : for the shift dynamics , they have the waveshape that achieves the maximum possible rate of orthogonal change for a given average energy ( equation  [ eq.max-rate ] ) .",
    "the average energy of a particle in a discrete position basis state is @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the time it takes the particle to travel from one integer position to the next .",
    "we derive these fastest - changing states directly from the hamiltonian @xmath44 in the next section .",
    "a general construction for fastest changing states is given in @xcite .",
    "these states are essentially fourier transforms of a finite set of energy eigenstates , which are the slowest changing states .    in the macroscopic limit",
    ", the discrete position basis states of equation  [ eq.ubasis ] are fastest changing states ( for given average energy ) of a 1d particle evolving under the shift dynamics .",
    "the case we are interested in , however , is finite and periodic .",
    "it is instructive to construct the exact states that achieve the energy bound of equation  [ eq.max-rate ] in this case .",
    "if we consider a situation where the particle travels only to the right ( equation  [ eq.schrodinger ] ) , then the energy eigenstates satisfy the equation @xmath45 we assume that our energy scale is chosen so that the smallest value of @xmath19 is zero .",
    "this equation is satisfied by an exponential of @xmath46 .",
    "if we use positive @xmath46 coordinates that range from 0 to @xmath9 in the box , then the generic solution that is periodic at @xmath47 is given by @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is a non - negative integer .",
    "this function satisfies equation  [ eq.energy-eigenstates ] provided @xmath50    in our cm embedding of an @xmath7-bit shift register dynamics , the only meaningful positions at integer times are @xmath51 for @xmath52 an integer : the wavefunction at the ( fictitious ) non - integer positions is a continuous extension , completely determined by the values at the integer positions .",
    "thus we require that the probabilities of finding the particle at integer positions at integer times add up to one , and so @xmath53 for which @xmath54 . using equations  [ eq.en ] and [ eq.normalized ]",
    "we can construct a normalized fastest changing state centered at position zero : in this case it is simply the sum of the @xmath7 different @xmath55 s taken with equal amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "therefore the fastest changing state centered at position @xmath56 is given by @xmath57 where the final expression comes from summing the geometric series and some rearrangement .",
    "the fastest changing states are fourier transforms of the energy eigenstates . for large @xmath7 , @xmath58 turns into @xmath41 of equation  [ eq.ubasis ] .",
    "@xmath58 also has the property that it is one for @xmath59 and zero for @xmath52 any other integer . for integer values of @xmath52 ,",
    "the @xmath58 functions provide a complete discrete - position basis for the finite system .",
    "the discrete position basis state @xmath58 corresponds to a probability distribution that is normalized both from a continuous and a discrete point of view .",
    "furthermore , the discrete normalization does nt apply just to a sampling of the state at integer locations : it applies to any discrete sampling of the state at a unit - spaced set of positions .",
    "the continuous normalization is apparent from equation  [ eq.fastest2 ] , since @xmath60    to see the generality of the discrete normalization , we similarly sum over positions @xmath61 where @xmath52 is an integer and @xmath62 .",
    "this shifted normalization also implies that if we start the system in a discrete - position basis state , then as the wavefunction shifts continuously with time the values sampled at fixed integer locations always constitute a normalized discrete representation of the state .",
    "both normalization properties are of course inherited by any normalized wavefunction @xmath63 constructed out of the @xmath64 states ( i.e. , any @xmath65 whose spectrum of spatial frequencies is bandlimited like the @xmath66 s ) .",
    "@xmath63 can be exactly reconstructed from the amplitudes @xmath67 sampled at integer locations : @xmath68      we can construct a @xmath69 state centered at any continuum position @xmath3 as a superposition of the @xmath7 discrete - position basis states @xmath70 centered at integer locations @xmath38 .",
    "this is obvious since the @xmath70 states form a complete basis for describing the continuously shifting time evolution of an initial @xmath70 state . a shift of all @xmath70 states by the same amount yields a new basis",
    "if we start our system with a particle at an integer location in a basis state and then change bases in step with the particle motion , we can follow the continuous motion of the particle , always seeing it in a single localized basis state . from this point of view the quantum motion",
    "is just as spatially local and continuous as the classical motion : in both cases we see the constraint on the classical system of a discrete set of possible positions at integer times reflected as a corresponding discrete set of possible intermediate positions at each intermediate time .",
    "the shift register example is easily extended to multiple particles .",
    "this simply corresponds to a value in the register ( figure  [ fig.register]a ) with more than a single ` 1 ' bit . for simplicity ,",
    "we ll assume for the moment that all particles are traveling to the right .    in elementary qm",
    ", the overall state of a collection of independent particles is normally represented using a product of single - particle states : we track the state of each particle separately as if it were the only particle in the system .    for our classical shift",
    "register we ve already described a single particle system using a localized wavepacket basis ( equation  [ eq.fastest3 ] ) . here",
    "we ll denote the single particle basis state where particle @xmath71 has its wavepacket centered at location @xmath46 as @xmath72 .",
    "an overall state can be described as a product of such states , one per particle .    since all particles are moving to the right",
    ", the direction @xmath33 is + 1 in all cases .",
    "the hamiltonian for a multi - particle system is then @xmath73 , where @xmath74 acts only on particle @xmath71 .",
    "for example , for a two particle system ( i.e. , shift register with two 1 s ) , the schrdinger equation would be @xmath75 this equation is satisfied if both @xmath76 and @xmath77 hold , and so the two particles each follow a shift dynamics .    by using a product of single - particle wavefunctions to construct our multiparticle wavefunction we ve added two kinds of extra states that did nt exist in the original shift register .",
    "first of all , our states can represent more than a single 1 at the same location , which is nt possible in the original shift register . secondly , our states keep track of which particle is which , but these particles are identical 1 s in a shift register and interchanging two 1 s in a binary number does nt give us a different state !",
    "we can fix both of these problems by combining each set of equivalent states into a single state .",
    "we do this by adding together all product states that differ only by a relabeling of identical particles and we call that a single state . in performing this sum on a set of @xmath78 equivalent states we weight half of the states by a factor of @xmath79 and half by @xmath80 .",
    "this is done in such a manner that the entire combination changes sign if we interchange any two particle labels ( i.e. , it is _ antisymmetrized _ ) . in our two particle example , the antisymmetrized wavefunction is @xmath81 using only antisymmetrized wavefunctions we can no longer represent two particles ( 1 s ) at the same location : as in this example , if two mean positions are equal ( i.e. , @xmath82 ) the wavefunction is zero .    replacing each set of equivalent states with a single antisymmetrized sum avoids over - representing states . for a classical embedding into qm",
    ", a superposition of classically distinct states corresponds to a classical statistical ensemble : we can interpret all probabilities as arising from ignorance about which single state the system started in .",
    "thus by assigning equal probabilities to a set of equivalent states , the antisymmetrized superposition represents the equivalent states as if we were completely ignorant about which particle was which . of course the particle label information does nt exist in the original finite - state dynamics and so , once again",
    ", the probabilities we ve assigned represent ignorance of fictitious classical details added in constructing our qm description .",
    "thus for a classical dynamics of bits , if a fixed number of identical 1 s are described quantum mechanically as if we could distinguish which is which , and then the fictitious distinctions are eliminated using superposition , they are _",
    "fermions_. if , instead , there were no constraint in our original classical dynamics on how many 1 s can be represented at each location , we would use symmetrization rather than antisymmetrization to eliminate the fictitious distinctions . in this case",
    "the 1 s would be _",
    "there are two kinds of probabilities that can arise in a quantum description of a classical finite - state dynamics",
    ". there may be unknown information about the state of the actual dynamics : this is represented by ordinary probabilities and contributes to the entropy of the system .",
    "there may also , however , be unknown information about fictitious classical details that were added in constructing the quantum description of the dynamics ( such as distinct labels for identical 1 s ) : this is represented by probabilities derived from amplitudes and does nt contribute to the entropy of the system .",
    "there is more to amplitudes than this , though .",
    "if the dynamics was always described in a single classical basis , then the superposition would evolve like a classical statistical ensemble and the coefficient of a basis state in the superposition could be any function of the basis state s ensemble probability  there is no recombining of coefficients in the ensemble dynamics .",
    "the fact that amplitudes are square roots of probabilities makes it possible to also use them to describe the system in multiple bases : the sum of the squares of component magnitudes is the same for a vector described in any basis .",
    "amplitudes , when used for basis change , still do nt represent unknown information about the real system , and so again do nt contribute to its entropy .      for a classical finite - state system with a conserved number of identical 1 s , we can treat the 1 s as distinguishable particles in a qm description and follow their trajectories .",

    "we discuss state - change energy and use it to define the ideal minimum energy of a finitary cm dynamics . in sections  [ sec.waves ] and [ sec.cb ] we apply this idea to two examples of finitary cm dynamics .      if a spatially extended finite - state system evolves in time synchronously , the rate of global state change dramatically underestimates the minimum energy needed for an actual physical realization of the dynamics . in particular , the energy of a collection of independent subsystems is additive : localized independent changes must be counted separately .",
    "we can arrive at a more realistic minimum - energy estimate by making use of the locality and time dependence inherent in a physical description of classical finite state dynamics .",

    "since the full 2d dynamics just turns peaks into valleys and vice versa , leaving straight segments unchanged , we can perform that dynamics equally well on the array of gradients ! as the 2d dynamics interchanges which blocking to use ,",
    "the dynamics on the gradients also alternates which pairs of gradients to update together . in all cases ,",
    "the dynamics on the gradients duplicates what happens on the string : if the two dynamics are both performed in parallel , the gradient listed below a column will always match the slope of the string in that column .",

    "turning a peak into a valley and vice versa is exactly the same as swapping the left and right elements of a block .",
    "leaving a ` // ` or ` \\\\ ` unchanged is also exactly the same as swapping the left and right elements of a block . in all cases ,",
    "the dynamics on the gradients is equivalent to a swap .",
    "this means that the left element of a block will get swapped into the right position , and at the next update it will be the left element of a new block and will get swapped into the right position , and so on .",
    "thus all of the gradients that start off in the left side of a block will travel uniformly to the right , and all of the gradients that start in the right side of a block will travel uniformly to the left .",
    "this shows that the system obeys a discrete version of the wave equation .",
    "half of the gradients constitute a right - going wave , and half constitute a left - going wave . at any step of the dynamics ,",
    "the 2d wave in the original dynamics is just the sum of the two waves : it is reproduced by laying gradients end to end !",
    "as the number of cells in our lattice gets arbitrarily large , the straight segments in our waves become smaller and smaller compared to the total width of the lattice , and the discrete wave equation turns smoothly into exactly the continuum wave equation . as we will see , though , even the discrete model exactly obeys the continuum wave equation .",
    "the discrete wave system also has another continuum limit that allows us to embed our discrete wave dynamics with time - dependent blocking into a continuous dynamics with a time - independent dynamical law .",

    "since the dynamics for the gradients is simply that all of the even numbered gradients shift one way and all of the odd numbered gradients shift the other , the state after @xmath7 steps corresponds exactly to the state we would have gotten by running one step on the original configuration , pairing the gradients into the alternate set of blocks and then replicating each block @xmath7 times .",
    "although the @xmath7-step dynamics is exactly equivalent to the original , the waves we reconstruct from the array of repeated blocks look much different than simply a scaled up version of the original wave : a peak ` /\\ ` does nt turn into a peak @xmath7 times as large , it turns into @xmath7 little peaks ` /\\/\\/\\ ... /\\ ` .",
    "this is a wiggly flat line , and as @xmath7 grows the wiggles get proportionately smaller and smaller compared to the straight parts ` // ` and ` \\\\ ` , which simply get @xmath7 times longer . in the limit ,",
    "the peaks turn into flat places with a net velocity up or down , still obeying the continuum wave equation .",
    "the rescaled continuum configurations correspond isomorphically with the discrete time evolution , since a flat portion of the wave moving up or down can simply be interpreted as an array of peaks or valleys .",
    "in fact , if we simply draw each block of the active partition that we ve been showing as ` /\\ ` or ` \\/ ` as a horizontal segment moving up or down instead , then the discrete dynamics is directly mapped onto the continuous wave equation without invoking any limiting process !",
    "since this evolution obeys the continuous wave equation we can draw it as the superposition of continuous rightgoing and leftgoing waves .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig.scale-wave]c .",
    "the top solid wave is a redrawing of figure  [ fig.scale-wave]a with a horizontal segment used instead of the ` /\\ ` ( or equivalently , the continuum limit of figure  [ fig.scale-wave]b ) .",
    "it is also the sum of the dotted rightgoing and leftgoing waves shown below it , each segment of which has slope @xmath91 .",
    "the collection of gradients that make up the rightgoing and leftgoing waves are shown at the bottom .",
    "these are just the even position ( top ) and odd position ( bottom ) gradients from figure  [ fig.scale-wave]a , each stretched to fill the width of a block .",
    "after the waves each move half the width of a gradient segment , all segments will again be aligned and will add up to a result that corresponds to the next step of the discrete wave dynamics , with the appropriate blocking .",
    "assume the string carrying a discrete wave wraps around a space of width @xmath7 .",
    "we ve discussed the horizontal motion of waves along such a string , but the string itself can move vertically . for example , a pattern such as ` /\\/\\/\\ ... /\\ ` all the way around the space reproduces itself after two steps , but shifted vertically by two lattice units .",
    "this is clearly the maximum rate of travel for a string : one position vertically per time step .",
    "we can express the net velocity of the string in terms of the populations of rightgoing and leftgoing gradient segments .",
    "with @xmath7 positions there are @xmath92 rightgoing segments and @xmath92 leftgoing segments , and the members of each group never change .",
    "thus if there are @xmath93 rightgoing ` \\ ` s , there must be @xmath94 rightgoing ` / ` s , and similarly for the other direction . therefore if we know the numbers @xmath93 and @xmath9 of rightgoing and leftgoing ` \\ ` s , we have complete population information .    for a wave that wraps around the space and",
    "joins at the ends , there must be equal numbers of ` / ` s and ` \\ ` s .",
    "thus half of the gradient segments must be ` \\ `",
    "s , @xmath95 the average upward velocity of the string depends on the difference between @xmath93 and @xmath9 , @xmath96 if we think of the dynamics as swapping adjacent pairs of gradients during each step ( even though ` \\\\ ` and ` // ` pairs do nt actually change ) , each gradient moves one position up or one position down during each update .",
    "a ` \\ ` moving right always moves the gradient it passes one up as it goes by , whereas a ` \\ ` moving left moves the gradient it passes one down .",
    "thus we get equation  [ eq.r - l ] for the average velocity of gradients that pass the @xmath92 ` \\ `",
    "the average velocity of gradients that pass the ` / ` s is exactly the same ( their populations are complementary but the effects of passing them are also complementary ) .    since the motion of each gradient contributes a velocity of @xmath97 to the the net motion of the string , it is natural to interpret the net motion relativistically .",
    "we can focus on just the ` \\ ` particles , since the ` / ` particles have the same behavior .",
    "the total energy is proportional to the number of identical particles all moving at the same speed , so we let @xmath98 ( equation  [ eq.r+l ] ) .",
    "since @xmath99 ( taking @xmath100 ) , this gives us a vertical momentum of @xmath101 ( equation  [ eq.r - l ] ) .",
    "then the mass of the string must be @xmath102 and @xmath103 where @xmath104 .",
    "we can exactly analyze the vertical motion of the string statistically , since the probability @xmath105 is the _ exact _ frequency with which leftgoing gradients will encounter a rightgoing ` \\ ` in the course of a cycle of length @xmath92 .",
    "a rightgoing gradient is the left element of a block of two adjacent string segments that are about to be updated by the dynamical rule . if the block contains ` \\/ `",
    "then the dynamics will move both elements upward one position .",
    "thus @xmath106 is the probability that , for any block holding part of the string , the left element of the string is ready to take an upward step , and @xmath107 the probability it is ready to take a downward step .",
    "similarly , if a block contains ` \\ ` as its right element ( i.e. , a leftgoing ` \\ ` ) , then the block is ready to take a downward step if the left element is ` / ` .",
    "the chance that the block contains a leftgoing ` \\ ` is @xmath108 which is just @xmath107 .",
    "thus in either position of a block , @xmath106 is the probability a gradient is ready to take an upward step and @xmath107 the probability it is ready to take a downward step , and so the average frequency ( per step ) of both elements of a block moving upward is @xmath109 and both downward is @xmath110 .",
    "the average upward velocity of the string is thus @xmath111 which just gives us back equation  [ eq.r - l ] .",
    "is also the probability of moving a gradient upward as it passes and @xmath107 the probability of moving it downward , the average vertical velocity @xmath112 is also given by @xmath113 . ]      our original continuous description of the elastic string dynamics involved minimal - motion between integer times : all cases remain motionless except for ` \\/ ` and ` /\\ ` , which turn into each other . thus the least possible energy for this transition determines the ideal kinetic energy for the string dynamics .",
    "since the average frequency ( per step ) of both elements of a block moving upward is @xmath109 and both downward is @xmath110 , the average fraction of the blocks that change per step is @xmath114 .",
    "this fraction times @xmath92 , the total number of blocks in the string , gives ( using equation  [ eq.bce ] ) the least possible average kinetic energy ( in energy units of @xmath42 ) . since the motion exactly repeats after a cycle of @xmath92 steps , the ideal kinetic energy per cycle is invariant .",
    "the minimum value of @xmath114 is @xmath115 and occurs when @xmath116 , which is also when @xmath117 .",
    "thus at low speeds , half of the block changes do nt contribute to the net vertical motion of the string .",
    "if we think of the string as a particle moving in one dimension ( i.e. , vertically ) with a horizontal internal dimension of width @xmath7 , then only the portion of the ideal kinetic energy that contributes to vertical motion is particle kinetic energy .",
    "thus at low speeds , the ideal particle kinetic energy is the excess over @xmath115 of the blocks that change , @xmath118 since @xmath119 , for small @xmath112 we have @xmath120 and we recover the expected non - relativistic kinetic energy .    as @xmath106 approaches zero or one , the fraction of the blocks that change approaches one and the vertical speed of the string also approaches one .",
    "thus as @xmath121 , all of the ideal kinetic energy contributes to the string motion : @xmath122 .",
    "if we think of the block changes that do nt contribute to overall string motion as internal dynamics of the string , then as the string approaches the speed 1 the internal dynamics stops : all of the changes contribute to overall string motion and none to internal dynamics .",
    "the internal dynamics exhibits relativistic time dilation .",
    "there is a slight subtlety , though , that arises from relativistically interpreting _ all _ gradient segments as moving .",
    "we correspondingly interpret a fraction @xmath123 of _ all _ segment motion as contributing to the internal motion , and so the internal dynamics slows down by this factor as the string speeds up .",
    "the remaining fraction @xmath124 of the segment motion contributes to the overall string motion .",
    "of course some of the internal `` motion ''",
    "we re counting here does nt involve block changes , but all of the segment motion that contribute to overall motion of the string does actually correspond to block changes .",
    "thus the fraction of all @xmath92 blocks of the string that contribute to kinetic energy of string - particle motion is in fact @xmath124 ( i.e. , @xmath125 ) . the fraction of blocks that contribute only to internal kinetic energy in the string is then the total fraction that change minus the external kinetic fraction , and so @xmath126 which is always non - negative and which approaches a fraction of all blocks of @xmath127 as @xmath112 approaches zero .",
    "the energy of the string is fixed and the rest mass @xmath128 approaches zero for strings that move at speeds approaching 1 . ]    related models of diffusive behavior which make contact with relativity are discussed in  @xcite . none of these relativistic discussions define a model with objects that have an internal dynamics .",

    ", particles will often pass through each other without affecting each other .",
    "for example , if two groups of black particles collide head on , they pass through each other . since most of the",
    "`` no interaction '' cases do nt occur in the kind of collision shown in figure  [ fig.rel-coll]a , we could augment the rule without affecting figure  [ fig.rel-coll]a by changing some of the `` no interaction '' cases",
    ".    @xmath129{figures / rel - block}\\ ] ]      figure  [ fig.rel-block ] shows a continuous time history for a collision of two groups of 8 incoming particles ( black arrows on the left ) . the solid lines trace the paths of black particles , the dotted lines show the paths of white particles .",
    "interactions occur at both the centers and the corners of the squares .",
    "the grid is shown with 8@xmath898 blocks of cells outlined by darker lines .",
    "notice that the upper group of 8 incoming black particles occupies the fifth column within an 8@xmath898 block , and the corresponding outgoing group of black particles also occupies the fifth column within an 8@xmath898 block . because of the uniform horizontal motion in this diagram , if we filled all of the columns in the two 8@xmath898 blocks on the left of the diagram with black particles ( moving right and down in the top block , right and up in the bottom block ) , each input column would separately turn into the corresponding output column within the rightmost 8 columns .",
    "thus two 8@xmath898 `` square balls '' would collide , reconstituting themselves one ball - width to the right of where the balls would have gone if no collision had occurred .",
    "thus the rss dynamics implements the soft sphere collision using square balls . by making balls",
    "square we allow them to sometimes collide along a horizontal axis and sometimes along a vertical axis  this couples the two dimensions .",
    "if the square balls were larger , they would shift correspondingly further to the right : the block dynamics is scale invariant .",
    "the square ball dynamics scales all the way down to 1@xmath891 square balls : even single particles reproduce ssm collisions .",
    "we can take a soft sphere model dynamics that is simulated at the finest grain size of the dynamics and reproduce it in a system @xmath38 times larger in each dimension at a rate @xmath38 times slower by simply replacing each block of the partition in the fine grain initial state by a tesselation of @xmath135 identical blocks in the scaled system ( cf . rescaling discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "rescaling can be used as a way to take the continuum limit of an rss model .",
    "if the time scale of the underlying rss dynamics is @xmath38 times smaller than that of a scaled system , for @xmath38 sufficiently large the microscopic space and time scales can be considered infinitesimal compared to the `` macroscopic '' scales . at that point",
    "we have the macroscopic system performing a dynamics that is exactly equivalent to a microscopic dynamics , but in an effectively continuous space and time .    when macroscopic blocks collide , there is a question of which block is which afterwards .",
    "this of course depends on how we decide to interpret which particle is which when two particles collide .",
    "for example , if we decide that particle labels never cross the plane of a two - particle collision , then block collisions look like figure  [ fig.ssm ] ( repulsive collision ) . if we decide particle labels always cross , then entire blocks pass through each other as they come together and then again as they come apart ( attractive collision ) .",

    "we could of course simply reinterpret the horizontal axis in the diagram as time , and this becomes a diagram of a 1d collision of two extended objects .    in this case",
    "blocks in the transition rule of figure  [ fig.rel-coll]b should be half as wide : particles have only two directions ( up and down ) .",
    "this is the only `` rotation '' of the rule in 1d .",
    "we still need two white particle types so that the white particles can pass through other white particles of the same type until the two different types come back together and collide at the `` axis '' of the collision .    to get the same rescalable ssm behavior in a 3d system we can simply apply the planar rule of figure  [ fig.rel-coll]b in various orientations : only pairs of particles collide and the entire collision process takes place in the plane defined by the two particle directions .",
    "we need to use more kinds of labels for the white particles ( more possibilities of which way they can turn ) , but for each collision plane only two kinds of turners are needed  these become the @xmath133 and @xmath134 particles in the rule .",
    "of course the scalable 2d square balls become 3d cubical balls , and we only use a set of directions for which collisions occur between parallel faces of cubes .",
    "since the rss model is a single - speed dynamics that conserves energy and momentum in its collisions , we are free to interpret it as a special case of a continuous classical relativistic dynamics with constrained initial conditions .    as two particles cross over the same spot in figure  [ fig.rel-block ] , we can consider the continuation of each particle to be either the one that went straight or the one that turned . in the former case the particles move at the speed of light and",
    "are massless . in the latter case",
    "the net motion of each particle during the timestep is horizontal at less than the speed of light and so it has mass .    in this model",
    "all isolated freely moving particles have the same energy @xmath137 , whose minimum possible value ( equation  [ eq.bce ] ) sets the ideal energy scale . for a classical particle moving at the speed of light , @xmath138 . in this section",
    "we use units in which @xmath100 , so that the magnitude of the momentum equals the energy for a massless particle . for each particle that changes direction in a crossover",
    "the average momentum during the timestep is only @xmath139 and so the mass is also @xmath139 , since @xmath140 .",
    "thus during the collision of figure  [ fig.rel-block ] , the mass goes from zero to a maximum of @xmath141 and then back to zero .",
    "in units of @xmath142 , the mass at each step of the collision is just the number of mass - generating crossings in a column .",
    "a collision of two @xmath143 square balls corresponds to @xmath49 simultaneous collisions such as the one in the figure . as we let the balls get larger and larger , the fraction of the total energy that is mass energy approaches one of the three curves shown in figure  [ fig.rel-mass]a .",
    "here we ve chosen our unit of time to be the time it takes a freely moving square ball to move the length of its diagonal . with this unit ,",
    "a collision takes two units of time .",
    "because of the symmetry of the collision , the fraction of the energy that is mass is the same for each of the two colliding balls : each ball changes energy into mass and then back again according to the curves shown .",
    "which curve the mass of each ball follows depends on how we interpret the particle crossings .",
    "we ve shown three possible interpretations .",
    "the `` maximum mass '' interpretation , ( coarse - dashed line ) is given as a function of time by considering _",
    "all _ crossings to be massive .",
    "the `` sudden mass '' interpretation ( thick - solid line ) interprets all particles of each square ball as moving straight ( with perhaps a change in particle - type ) until the moment the two balls completely overlap , and then all crossings have mass until the two balls start to separate . the `` white mass '' interpretation ( fine - dashed line )",
    "is given by only counting pairs of white particles that cross to be massive .",
    "the `` maximum mass '' interpretation corresponds to the minimum possible motion ( least kinetic energy ) .",
    "let us associate the entire mass of each ball with a single representative point .",
    "for a freely moving ball , the representative point is the center of the ball . since @xmath103 the ratio of mass to energy shown in figure",
    "[ fig.rel-mass]a is equal to @xmath123 . knowing @xmath144 as a function of time gives us the velocity @xmath112 of the ball as a function of time .",
    "since the horizontal component of @xmath112 is unaffected by the collision and remains constant this gives us the vertical velocity as a function of time , and hence the vertical position as a function of time .",
    "this is depicted in figure  [ fig.rel-mass]b , where we ve shown the path that the representative point for each ball must follow during a collision if its mass varies according to one of the three curves in figure  [ fig.rel-mass]a .",
    "the three cases show that exactly the same collision can be interpreted as attractive , repulsive , or sticky .",
    "it is clear from the behavior of @xmath145 and @xmath146 as functions of time that the ratio @xmath145 depends only on the separation @xmath147 between the two representative points ( once the interaction starts ) .",
    "this dependence is graphed in figure  [ fig.rel-mass]c .",
    "thus if we think of mass as a kind of relativistic potential energy ( i.e. , total energy minus kinetic energy ) , we see that it depends only on the distance between the two balls .",
    "the potential is zero when the balls are not yet close enough to touch and it increases as the balls collide .",
    "the maximum mass @xmath78 for each ball is the fraction @xmath148 of the ball s energy , which obtains when all particles are paired so that there is maximum cancellation of vertical momentum components .",
    "we were able to use the rss model to discuss mass in a relativistic collision by interpreting the model s single particle - speed as the speed of light and its conservations as relativistic conservations .",
    "this model is , however , clearly not very relativistic even in a continuum limit .",
    "while it does display macroscopic mechanical behavior , it does so only in a single inertial frame .",
    "it thus does not exhibit relativistic frame invariance .",
    "we might expect that , for a colliding pair of rss particles , the relativistic kinetic energy ( which includes only energy related to net translational motion ) should be closely related to the state - change energy ( which is the minimum energy for the net motion ) .",
    "this suggests that we might be able to use the intrinsic definition of ideal kinetic energy provided by state - change to expose the non - relativistically invariant character of the rss model .    if we interpret freely moving rss particles as massless , as we did in section  [ sec.mass-energy ] , then state - change energy and relativistic kinetic energy evolve differently .",
    "the state - change energy of both a free particle and of a block where two particles cross are the same ( equation  [ eq.bce ] ) . in constrast , if the relativistic kinetic energy of a free massless particle is @xmath137 , then the relativistic kinetic energy of a block containing two massless particles whose paths intersect at right angles is only @xmath149 .",
    "we can try to reinterpret the rss dynamics to make the relativistic kinetic energy match the state - change energy both for a free particle and for a two - particle collision . if we let free rss particles each have mass @xmath150 and let a two - particle collision have mass @xmath151 we find that the only choice of masses that allows the two energies to be equal is @xmath152 , which corresponds to @xmath153 .",
    "thus the state - change energy becomes the ideal kinetic energy in the rss model only for a non - relativistic interpretation of the dynamics .",
    "a finite - sized qm system has only a finite number of possible distinct states and can move between distinct states at only a finite rate .",
    "this means that classical special cases of qm dynamics must be classical finite - state dynamics .",
    "conversely , we can regard the dynamics of real physical systems to be a generalization of classical finite - state dynamics .",
    "this is not a common viewpoint among physicists today .",
    "the study of classical finite - state dynamics that are special cases of qm dynamics should , at the least , be of interest for pedagogical reasons since it allows physical concepts to be seen in an intuitive classical setting .",
    "this study should also be of interest to theoretical computer science since it establishes an exact correspondence between a classical computation and an ideal quantum realization .",
    "finally , this study should be of interest to theoretical physics since it provides a novel finite - state perspective on the foundations of both classical and quantum mechanics , along with an intuitive starting point for the construction of new physical models .",
