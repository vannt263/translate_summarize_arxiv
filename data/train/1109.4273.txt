    "* ( ruiter et al . 2011 ) ) , very strongly depends on the assumed efficiency of he - accumulation ( piersanti et al . , these proceedings ) .",
    "also , models do not fit observables , due to the presence of he - burning products in the outer layers of ejecta .",

    "sss , which are deemed to be nuclearly burning white dwarfs ( nbwd , , may be direct precursors of  in the sd - scenario . in the dd - scenario ,",
    "a binary may be a sss when the first - formed wd accretes matter from the stellar wind of the precursor of the second wd .",
    "the number of observed sss provides the lower limit of the number of nbwd , since the latter do not necessarily radiate in x - ray .",
    "below , we consider the relations between the rates of formation of nbwd , , sss in the model of stellar system with a constant for 10gyr star formation rate @xmath2 and for a model in which the same mass of stars is formed in a 1gyr long star - formation burst , i.e. for toy - models of a spiral and an elliptical galaxy .",
    "we test also the influence of ce parameters and mass accumulation efficiency upon dtd .",
    "our assumptions are described in ( * ? ? ? * yungelson ( 2010 ) ) .",
    "note , we do not consider effects like `` stripping '' or `` companion reinforced attrition process '' .",

    "* webbink s ( 1984 ) ) equation for ce . total dominance of dd mergers is clear , irrespective of assumptions on @xmath3 and efficiency of matter accumulation .",
    "the main reason for this is a narrow range of combinations of masses of components in semidetached systems which allows steady accumulation of the matter .",
    "bearing in mind all uncertainties involved in population synthesis and in derivation of dtd from observations , the slope of the model dd dtd ( @xmath4 ) compares well with the slope of dtd curve ( @xmath5 at @xmath6myr ) derived by ( * ? ? ?",

    "figure [ fig : rates ] shows results of computations for two model stellar systems . formation rate of close binary wd reflects sfr , hence ,  in the dd - scenario start at the age of several tens of myr when the most massive pairs of wd begin to form . in the `` spiral '' galaxy binary wd form",
    "continuously and dd - rate permanently increases , since merge both `` old '' initially relatively wide pairs and `` young '' relatively close ones . in the `` elliptical '' galaxy",
    "the reservoir of binary wd created in the star - formation burst gradually `` melts '' and soon after cessation of star formation dd-  rate starts to decline .    in semidetached systems",

    "occur in binaries with @xmath9  and @xmath10  at the beginning of roche - lobe overflow .",
    "figure  [ fig : rates ] shows that formation rate of semidetached systems with nbwd able to accumulate   is only a minor fraction of the total formation rate of systems with nbwd even in the relatively early stages of evolution .",
    "semidetached systems with nbwd form continuously , but _ in the case of burst - like star formation currently observed sss are not precursors of _ .",
    "the epoch of  in semidetached systems is short : in the model `` spiral '' galaxy at @xmath11gyr   occur in stars formed approximately 600myr to 2.5gyr ago .",
    "the phenomenon of symbiotic stars is associated predominantly with wide binaries , in which wd form neither through rlof nor ce .",
    "as the donor begins to ascend the giant branch , its stellar wind is weak and in a binary with @xmath12  day accretion is extremely inefficient .",
    "newborn nbwd first becomes an unstable burner and , typically , it may become a stationary burner only shortly before the loss of the envelope by companion ( * ? ? ? * ( yungelson et al .",

    "* ( l et al . 2006 ) ) .",
    "an implication of this is that co",

    "the fraction of outbursting systems is initially low , since first start to overfill their roche lobes relatively massive stars with high .",
    "later , the fraction of systems in which the rate of accretion is lower than the limit for stable h - burning increases , since the systems with massive donors finish their evolution fast . at @xmath15=10gyr ,",
    "the number of nbwd in a `` spiral '' galaxy exceeds their number in an `` elliptical '' galaxy of the same mass and masses of wd are also higher ( fig .",

    "* ( di stefano 2010 ) ) , the number of nbwd in the models at least qualitatively agrees with the one expected from observations .",
    "this brings to conclusion that the model in which the rate of   is defined by dd - mechanism and which is reasonably consistent with observationally inferred dtd , is also able to explain , at least partially , the difference in the numbers of sss in spiral and elliptical galaxies ."
