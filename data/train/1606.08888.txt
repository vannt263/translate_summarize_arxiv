    "consider a transformation on @xmath4 which creates a new polygon @xmath9 by taking the midpoints of the original , connecting them , and then normalizing the resulting vertex vectors to unit length .",
    "it has been shown that iteration of this process produces a sequence of polygons @xmath10 converging to an ellipse oriented at @xmath11 degrees @xcite .    our goal is to relax the condition of taking only the midpoint , and allow the point of division @xmath12 to vary inside the open unit interval .",
    "indeed , there is an elegant and surprising invariance in the orientation of our ellipse that hints at a deeper underlying structure for this type of problem .",
    "we note that this paper will make absolutely no assumption on our initial polygon .",
    "we do not require convexity or any other special condition that makes our polygon well - behaved .",
    "this is truly an example of order out of pure chaos . indeed",
    ", there are numerous papers written on the subject of iterative transformations of random polygons , in which limiting behavior is of interest .",
    "many of these papers hint at an underlying invariance and structure of these types of iterations ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "in proving the case for @xmath3 a matrix @xmath13 was introduced such that if @xmath14 is the x coordinates of our vertex vectors after the kth iteration , then @xmath15 .",
    "we then wish to study the sequence @xmath16 , where @xmath17 denotes the polygon @xmath18 with vertex coordinates given by @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "since the polygon is entirely determined by these two vectors , we shall only study how each vertex vector changes with respect to our transformation . in this way",
    ", we find that our question of convergence becomes a question of the properties of iterating @xmath13 .",
    "following in these tracks , we introduce a more general version that applies to any @xmath12 .",
    "let @xmath19    with @xmath13 defined as so , we can turn to the analysis of its properties . without normalizing after every iteration , it can be shown that iteration of @xmath13 will produce a sequence that eventually converges to the centroid of our original polygon .    the sequence of vertex vectors @xmath20 and @xmath21 created by iteration of @xmath13 has the same centroid for every @xmath22 .",
    "letting @xmath23 represent an @xmath24 matrix of 1 s , we note that the centroid of the @xmath5 coordinates of our polygon is just @xmath25 , and the centroid of the @xmath6 coordinates is defined analogously .",
    "we then see : @xmath26    from this , we deduce that if our sequence converges to a point , that point is the centroid of our initial polygon , and that every polygon in the sequence has the same centroid .",
    "intuitively , it is clear that    @xmath27 \\subset \\big [ \\min \\ { \\vec{x}^{(k ) } \\ } , \\max \\ { \\vec{x}^{(k ) } \\ } \\big]\\ ] ]    where @xmath28 denotes the largest component of the vector @xmath29 ( and the minimum defined analogously ) .",
    "if we had a contraction after every iteration , it is obvious that the sequence of nested intervals must converge to a point . not",
    "every case will induce a contraction , though , with the obvious example being a square .",
    "however , since our polygon must have a finite number of vertices , after a sufficiently large amount of iterations , our transformation intuitively should induce a contraction . indeed",
    ", we will make this intuition more rigorous in section 5 .    by introducing the upshift matrix @xmath30 @xcite , which is just the identity matrix with all of its entries shifted up once",
    ", we see that @xmath31    in this way , we see that @xmath13 shares the same eigenvectors as @xmath30 but with different eigenvalues .",
    "since @xmath30 is unitary , its eigenvectors will be orthogonal . by normalizing we create an orthonormal set of eigenvectors where the eigenvalues of @xmath30 are @xmath1th roots of unity .",
    "allow that @xmath32 and    @xmath33    it is easy to see that @xmath34 . in this way , we can also see that @xmath35 so that the eigenvectors of @xmath30 are also eigenvectors of @xmath13 .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath13 lie on the circle of radius @xmath12 centered at @xmath36 on the complex plane .    .",
    "from top to bottom the initial polygons have @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 vertices , respectively .",
    "we see that the transformation does seems to tend to the centroid , and smaller @xmath1 seem to converge faster . ]    . from top",

    "to bottom the initial polygons have @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 vertices , respectively .",
    "we see that the transformation does seems to tend to the centroid , and smaller @xmath1 seem to converge faster . ]",
    "from @xcite we see that our analysis leads in the direction of repeated iteration of @xmath13 onto a unit vector with centroid zero in the span of our eigenvectors .",
    "we can assume that our unit vector has centroid zero because we can always just redefine the centroid as the origin of our coordinate system .",
    "this seemingly innocent assumption simplifies our analysis because it in fact forces our eigenvectors to be a dependent set , and the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath41 turns out to be redundant .",
    "it can then be seen that our vectors will becomes increasingly rich in the second largest eigenvalue and its complex conjugate .",
    "the rate at which our other eigenvectors converge can be measured by a _ damping factor _",
    "@xmath40 defined as the magnitude of the ratio of the third largest eigenvalue to the second largest .",
    "the reason we consider this is based off of an approximation method known as the _ power method_. consider :    @xmath42    this definition makes the most sense if we reorder our eigenvalues in such a way that @xmath43    we now seek to find an explicit damping factor .",
    "@xmath44 ^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\ ] ]    with some basic algebra this can be simplified to :    @xmath45^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\ ] ]    with , we deduce the following :    for any @xmath0 , @xmath40 attains a minimum at @xmath3 .",
    "differentiate @xmath40 with respect to @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath46 we have : @xmath47    after some simplification , we are left with : @xmath48    @xmath49    it is interesting to note that the above proof does not specify any value for @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , this condition holds for any arbitrary @xmath1 .    with the damping factor",
    "now specified , it is clear that upon iteration the damping factor will eventually converge to 0 .",
    "heuristically , the damping factor makes sense because as our sequence tends to infinity , the largest eigenvalues will of course dictate the overall behavior of the sequence . by the above lemma we see that the midpoint yields the fastest possible rate of convergence .",
    "we now intend to specify what this sequence is actually converging to .            .",
    "from top to bottom we have chosen @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 .",
    "it can be seen that as @xmath12 tends closer to @xmath53 , the rate of convergence is faster . ]",
    "we introduce an invariant subspace under our operator @xmath13 which is defined as @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a reordering of our eigenvectors in such a way that @xmath57 .    with the material of the previous section , we can introduce the undamped ( unit normed ) vector @xmath58    where @xmath59 are arbitrary constants . in this way",
    ", we define @xmath60 where @xmath61 is a centroid zero unit vector in @xmath62 . with this",
    ", we see that @xmath63    since @xmath64 for all @xmath0 , it is clear that our vector must eventually converge to @xmath54 .",
    "we now show the underlying structure of @xmath54 by the introduction of a new set of coordinates .",
    "let    @xmath65    in matrix notation we can define @xmath66 as the matrix with @xmath67 in the jth row .",

    "define @xmath73 where @xmath74 is arbitrary . noting that @xmath75",
    ", we have :    @xmath76 @xmath77 @xmath78    similarly , we can find that @xmath79    in matrix notation , we have :    @xmath80 @xmath81    in order to study the iteration of @xmath13 on these two basis elements , it is crucial to first introduce suitable notation .",
    "let @xmath82 and @xmath83    now let @xmath84 and @xmath85 setting @xmath86 , we can now put the above equation in a much more succinct form .",
    "we have :    @xmath87    @xmath88    in this form our two expressions resemble a recurrence relation , which motivates us to look for a closed form of @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "we see that it in fact satisfies a strikingly symmetric relationship .",
    "let @xmath91 and @xmath92 be defined as above .",

    "we then have :    @xmath95    @xmath96    by induction .",
    "base case is trivial .",
    "we proceed inductively :    @xmath97 @xmath98 collecting terms , we see the coefficient of @xmath99 is : @xmath100    @xmath101    @xmath102    where the angle sum formula was used for the last step .",
    "likewise we find the coefficient for @xmath103 as :    @xmath104 @xmath105 as desired .",
    "the case for @xmath106 is nearly identical .",
    "if we rewrite the results given above a little differently , the elegance and symmetry of the two expressions becomes more striking .",
    "we have :    @xmath107 @xmath108",
    "we now summarize a collection of the above results to continue below . without loss of generality",
    ", we can assume our given polygon has centroid at the origin . under this assumption , we then know that both vectors @xmath7 and @xmath8 are orthogonal to @xmath109 , the @xmath24 vector of all 1 s .",
    "thus : @xmath110    from here , we can express @xmath14 and @xmath111 as : @xmath112 @xmath113    where @xmath114    @xmath115    and @xmath116 , @xmath117 are arbitrary scalars .",
    "let us now assume that @xmath118 is a given unit vector such that @xmath119    we want to examine the behavior of @xmath120 . using the results of the previous section",
    ", we can now do this and find a rather simple closed form .",
    "@xmath121    @xmath122    similarly , we see @xmath123 with this result we are now able to prove the following lemma .    for any arbitrary point of division @xmath0 , iteration of @xmath13 onto the vertices of a given polygon will converge to the centroid of the polygon , and every polygon in the sequence will have the same centroid .    from lemma 2.1",
    "we have already shown that if our sequence converges to a point , then the hypothesis holds .",
    "we must then show that our vertices will in fact converge to a point .",
    "since we have already shown our vertex vectors @xmath124 , @xmath125 will become arbitrarily close to @xmath120 and @xmath126 , respectively , we only need to show convergence of the latter two vectors .    from and , we then deduce : @xmath127 for @xmath0 , @xmath128 . thus ,    @xmath129 @xmath130    therefore @xmath131 for all @xmath0 ( similarly for @xmath132 ) , so our sequence converges to a single point , the centroid .    * corollary*. the sequence of polygons @xmath16 such that @xmath3 will converge most quickly to the centroid of @xmath133 .",
    "we note that @xmath134 is positive everywhere except its root @xmath3 . from the work of the above lemma",
    ", we have :    @xmath135    with equality if and only if @xmath3 .",
    "we now turn our attention back to the behavior of our normed vectors @xmath136 and @xmath137 . from and",
    ", we see that the magnitudes of these vectors are only dependent on the magnitude @xmath138 , and so we easily deduce the normed vertex vectors :    @xmath139    @xmath140    from @xcite we find that our ellipse can be completely specified by the singular value decomposition ( svd ) of the set given by :    @xmath141    where @xmath142 .",
    "we now seek to find the svd of our 2x2 matrix .",
    "this is because , if we put a matrix @xmath143 , then the matrices @xmath144 and @xmath145 will specify the tilt of our ellipse , whose semiaxes are specified by the diagonal elements of our matrix @xmath146 .    if @xmath147    then there exist matrices @xmath144 , @xmath146 , and @xmath145 such that @xmath143 , where    @xmath148    @xmath149    @xmath150    it can be shown @xcite that the singular value decomposition for any 2x2 matrix is of the form @xmath151    the rest is omitted as it is not essential to understanding the properties of our ellipse .",
    "the explicit forms are found by straightforward computation of the explicit forms of the svd of a 2x2 matrix ( see @xcite ) .",
    "firstly , we see that by the matrices and , our ellipse will still be oriented at 45 degrees no matter what @xmath0 is chosen .",
    "one of the properties to be analyzed can be deduced from the matrix : periodic semi - axes .",
    "this can be seen by the explicit forms of each semi - axes of our ellipse , which are given by : @xmath152 @xmath153    , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 , respectively .",
    "we see that each @xmath12 tends to the ellipse at @xmath11 degrees , and values closer to @xmath53 converge more quickly . ]    , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 , respectively .",
    "we see that each @xmath12 tends to the ellipse at @xmath11 degrees , and values closer to @xmath53 converge more quickly . ]    , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 , respectively .",
    "we see that each @xmath12 tends to the ellipse at @xmath11 degrees , and values closer to @xmath53 converge more quickly . ]",
    "recall that @xmath154 @xmath140    by the periodicity of the trigonometric functions , we deduce an interesting property of the @xmath54 ellipse .    for @xmath93 , where @xmath91 and @xmath92 defined as before , @xmath136 is periodic with period @xmath155 if and only if @xmath156 is a rational multiple of @xmath157 .",
    "assume @xmath158 , where @xmath159 .",
    "we have : @xmath160 from here we see that @xmath161 must vanish after the use of elementary trigonometric identities .",
    "thus @xmath162 where @xmath163 , @xmath159 .",
    "also , @xmath164 , and likewise for @xmath99 . therefore we see that this is periodic since the upshift matrix is just a reordering of our entries .",
    "the converse is trivial .",
    "although this is a rather idealized case , in practice it seems that there still exists some periodicity , or _ almost periodicity _",
    ", for any point of division .",
    "this stems from the fact that for any given argument of @xmath165 as defined , it can be approximated arbitrarily close to some rational multiple of @xmath157 .",
    "explicitly , we have : @xmath166 where we allow that @xmath163 be any arbitrary integer .",
    "we do not hold @xmath163 to be fixed , we allow it to vary . because of this , as @xmath22 , @xmath156 will be sufficiently close to a rational multiple of @xmath157 an arbitrary amount of times .    to illustrate this more clearly ,",
    "consider taking @xmath38 randomized vertices with @xmath167 .",
    "then , we first start taking @xmath168 .",
    "we now scale this by some integer such that our value is very close to an integer . in this case , it is clear that scaling by @xmath169 gets us close to the number @xmath170 , so we could expect that this is weakly periodic with a period of @xmath170 . continued scaling shows us other places where we get even closer to integer values . for instance , scaling by @xmath171 gives us a number extremely close to @xmath172 , and it is to be expected that this process can be carried out indefinitely for closer and closer approximations .",
    "in fact , this is an illustration of _ dirichlet s approximation theorem _ , which gives us the following fact :    given the number @xmath157 , there exists an infinite sequence of rational numbers such that @xmath173 of course , this is just a particular case , and dirichlet s theorem has a much more general statement .",
    "finally , we consider our semi - axes .",
    "as is clearly seen by our matrix , we have semi - axes that are dependent on @xmath174 .",
    "this leads us to deduce a property of oscillating semi - axes . in practice",
    ", however , this oscillation is very slight and almost impossible to see for larger @xmath1 , as can be predicted by the fact that our periodicity gets much larger as the number of vertices grows .",
    "we now consider the case of taking a different point of division at each segment .",
    "we can now use the results given so far to generalize even further .",
    "suppose that we are given a polygon @xmath175 and instead of using a fixed point of division @xmath12 for every segment , we give an arbitrary and different point of division @xmath176 to the @xmath94th segment of our polygon .",
    "this case is inherently similar , and can in fact be reduced to the properties of the sequences of polygons @xmath177 , where @xmath178 denotes the sequence of polygons produced by our iteration when using the fixed point of division @xmath176 for each segment . in this way , it is easy to see that we can express our random point of division polygon , denoted @xmath179 as : @xmath180    with this form , we see that iteration of @xmath13 on the vertex vectors of @xmath179 without normalization will will also converge to the centroid of the original polygon , since we have already proved that every polygon in the intersection has to converge to the centroid .",
    "we now consider the case of @xmath181 , which is the normalized iteration .",
    "it can be easily shown that our periodicity will exist if and only if @xmath156 is a rational multiple of @xmath157 and that our period will become @xmath182 $ ] , where @xmath183 is the period of the ellipse produced by @xmath176 .",
