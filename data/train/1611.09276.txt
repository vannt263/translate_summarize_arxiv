    "moreover , although the algorithm was proved to generate a sequence of approximations @xmath17 to the hausdorff dimension ( depending on points of period up to @xmath18 ) , with convergence rate faster than any exponential , the derived error bounds were sufficiently conservative ( see remark [ conservative ] below ) that it was unclear whether they could be combined with the computed approximations to yield any effective _ rigorous _ estimate .    in the current paper",
    "we investigate the possibility of sharpening the approach of @xcite so as to obtain rigorous computer - assisted estimates on @xmath19 , with particular focus on @xmath0 .",
    "there are several ingredients in this sharpening .",
    "the first step is to locate a disc @xmath20 in the complex plane with the property that the images of @xmath20 under the mappings @xmath21 , @xmath22 , are contained in @xmath20 .",
    "it then turns out to be preferable to consider the transfer operator as acting on a _",
    "space of analytic functions on @xmath20 , rather than the banach space of @xcite ; this facilitates an estimate on the taylor coefficients of @xmath16 in terms of the _ approximation numbers _ ( or _ singular values _ ) of the operator , which is significantly better than those bounds derived from banach space methods .",
    "the specific hilbert space used is hardy space , consisting of those analytic functions on the disc which extend as @xmath23 functions on the bounding circle .",
    "the contraction of @xmath20 by the mappings @xmath24 , @xmath22 , prompts the introduction of the _ contraction ratio _ , which captures the strength of this contraction , and leads to estimates on the convergence of the approximations to the hausdorff dimension .",
    "the @xmath25 taylor series coefficient of @xmath16 can be expressed in terms of periodic points of period up to @xmath18 , and for sufficiently small @xmath18 these can be evaluated exactly , to arbitrary precision . for larger @xmath18 ,",
    "we show it is advantageous to obtain two distinct types of upper bound on the taylor coefficients : we refer to these as the _ euler bound _ and the _ computed taylor bound_. the euler bound is used for all sufficiently large @xmath18 , while the computed taylor bound is used for a finite intermediate range of @xmath18 corresponding to those taylor coefficients which are deemed to be computationally inaccessible , but where the euler bound is insufficiently sharp .",
    "intrinsic to the definition of the computed taylor bounds is the sequence of _ computed approximation bounds _ , which we introduce as computationally accessible upper bounds on the approximation numbers of the transfer operator .",
    "as an example of the effectiveness of the resulting method we rigorously justify the first 100 decimal digits of the hausdorff dimension of @xmath0 , thereby improving on the rigorous estimates in @xcite . specifically , we prove ( see theorem [ e2theorem ] ) that @xmath26 using the periodic points of period up to 25 .",
