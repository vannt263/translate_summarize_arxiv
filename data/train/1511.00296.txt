    "evolution is the self - sustaining , open - ended process arising wherever entities ( organisms , algorithms , memes , etc . )",
    "are subject to differential reproduction , heredity and variation .",
    "the specifics of this process are as diverse as life itself , but its basic structure  the principle of the  survival of the fittest \" is abstract and universal . does this general _ principle _ translate into a general _ pattern_a pattern which could be predicted mathematically and tested empirically , in the same way in which , say , energy conservation translates into the boltzmann distribution in statistical mechanics ? are there falsifiable _ laws of evolution _ ?",
    "experience in the physical and statistical sciences suggests that emergent patterns often arise through suitable  coarse - gainings \" , i.e. after large numbers of different configurations of the system are grouped according to dynamically relevant _ macroscopic _ variables . in practice , pinpointing these relevant variables is no easy task , as the history of thermodynamics and the discovery of energy as a conserved quantity shows ; in biology , it was not until darwin s _ origin of species _ that such a variable  reproductive rate or malthusian _ _ fitness__was identified .",
    "the formal analogy between these two coarse - grained variables , energy and fitness , has been repeatedly highlighted in recent years @xcite , but an equivalent to the boltzmann distribution for evolutionary dynamics has yet to be identified .",
    "these considerations encourage us to push darwin s logic to its end and treat populations as collections of _ fitness classes_groups of individuals with the same reproductive rate irrespective of their phenotype ; we can then ask about the structure of _ fitness distributions _ in evolving systems . to be sure",
    ", this approach amounts to a dramatic reduction of biological ( or algorithmic , or cultural ) reality : important ingredients such as genotype , phenotype , but also evolutionarily stable strategies , etc .",
    ", are entirely left out of the analysis",
    ". such may be , however , the price to pay to lift ourselves off from system - dependent properties and extract a robust prediction from the darwinian paradigm .    to our knowledge , the fitness space approach was first explored by eshel in 1971 within a discrete - time framework @xcite ; in continuous time , it was introduced by tsimring _",
    "_ @xcite . using a  diffusion approximation \" familiar from non - equilibrium statistical mechanics ,",
    "these authors went on to identify a class of  fitness waves \" solutions : gaussian - shape fitness distributions moving at constant speed towards higher fitness values @xcite .",
    "subsequent literature has developed methods to compute the speed of these fitness waves in terms of the frequency , effect and fixation probability of new mutations @xcite .",
    "the major finding of these studies is the extreme sensitivity of that speed to stochastic effects of rare mutations : in daniel fisher s words , fitness waves describe the evolutionary process as  a dog led by its mutational nose \" @xcite .",
    "fitness waves hint at a general statistical pattern , but they are incomplete in one key respect : they disregard the importance of _ negative selection _ in evolution .",
    "positive ( or directional ) selection consists in the growth of newly discovered high - fitness traits at the expense of slower reproducers , resulting in significant gains for the population mean fitness ; by contrast , negative selection is the removal of low - fitness individuals without any new beneficial traits being introduced into the population .",
    "a condition for positive selection to sustain itself through time is that beneficial mutations are sufficiently frequent : the  diffusion approximation \" of tsimring _ et al .",
    "_ expresses this assumption in extreme form by imposing that new mutations are _ infinitely frequent _ with _ infinitely small _ fitness effects ( both beneficial and deleterious ) .",
    "this can potentially capture aspects of the evolutionary process in phases of rapid adaptation , but not much more ",
    "real mutations ( in biology and in other fields ) are rare , mostly deleterious , and can occasionally have major fitness effects .    in this paper",
    "we reconsider the dynamics of fitness distributions under less restrictive assumptions , with the goal of identifying more general patterns of evolution .",
    "our approach consists in proving _",
    "limit theorems _ for fitness distributions , analogous to the h - theorem in statistical physics or the central limit theorem in probability theory .",
    "limit theorems are powerful tools which cut through the complexity of statistical phenomena to extract their emergent , or  universal \" properties ; in this sense they are the mathematician s  extra sense \" famously envied by darwin .",
    "a key ingredient underlying all limit theorems is the distinction between a probability distribution and its _",
    "type_. technically , the type of distribution is its equivalence class under an affine transformation of its argument ; in practice , this means the _ shape _ of the distribution , i.e. all information in the distribution except its location and scale . as a rule , limit theorems show that distribution types are more strongly constrained by large - number effects than location or scale . in the h - theorem , for instance , the mean and variance of the boltzmann distribution depend on temperature , hence are system - dependent ; its exponential structure is not .",
    "that is , _ types , not distributions , are subject to emergence and universality_.    we combine an exact solution of the general replication - mutation equation in fitness space with suitable asymptotic estimates to prove that _ evolving fitness distributions are attracted to a one - parameter family of universal types_. this pattern breaks down into two sub - patterns : under positive selection ( of pre - existing variation or of new mutations ) , fitness is normally distributed ; under negative selection and weak mutations , fitness has a reverted gamma distribution .",
    "a generic evolution trajectory consists of crossovers between these types .",
    "we check these findings with numerical simulations of the wright - fisher process and with a simple genetic algorithm .",
    "we consider an infinite population with a continuous distribution of ( malthusian ) fitness @xmath0 .",
    "we assume that fitness - changing new mutations occur with a rate @xmath1 , and that their fitness effects @xmath2 , with @xmath3 ( resp .",
    "@xmath4 ) for beneficial ( resp . deleterious ) mutations , are distributed according to some distribution of fitness effects ( dfe ) @xmath5 , a common assumption in evolutionary biology @xcite .",
    "( for clarity of the presentation we assume that the mutation rate @xmath1 and dfe @xmath5 are fixed , but our results can be straightforwardly generalized to time - dependent and/or stochastic mutational effects to allow for changing fitness landscapes , changing environments , etc . )",
    "the dynamical equation for the evolution of fitness distributions under selection and mutation can be formulated both in continuous and in discrete time , without it making any difference for our purposes .",
    "for definiteness we focus on the continuous case , where it reads @xmath6\\ ] ] with @xmath7 the mean fitness at time @xmath8 .",
    "the first term in this equation expresses natural selection , i.e. the population effect of differential fitness ; the second term is the mutation term , responsible for the introduction of new variations in fitness distributed according to the dfe @xmath5 .",
    "after ref .",
    "@xcite this  replicator - mutator equation \" is often approximated by a reaction - diffusion equation , with the mutation integral replaced by a term proportional to @xmath9 , but this step is neither well justified  real mutations are not infinitely frequent  nor necessary .",
    "indeed we can obtain the general solution of in closed form for any dfe .",
    "it suffices for that to transform into an equation for the cumulant - generating - function ( cgf ) of the fitness distribution , defined by @xmath10 $ ] .",
    "this gives a simple transport - like equation , with explicit solution ( appendix [ appendixevo ] ) @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the moment - generating - function ( mgf ) of the dfe .",
    "this reformulation is intuitively appealing : in @xmath13-space , natural selection corresponds to the transport of the initial cgf @xmath14 towards progressively lower values of @xmath15 , and mutations to a source term , see fig .",
    "[ transportfig ] .     space .",

    "the explicit solution allows us to distinguish between two different regimes of evolution . indeed depending on the relative magnitude of the terms above",
    ", the evolutionary trajectory can either be dominated by the _ selection of pre - existing variation _ , in which case @xmath27 or by the _ selection of new mutations _ , and then we have @xmath28 note that eq . is _ not _ the solution of without the selection term on the right - hand side .",
    "we now analyze these two regimes separately , using the tools of asymptotic analysis .",
    "henceforth the symbol @xmath29 stands for  asymptotically equivalent up to a multiplicative constant \" .",
    "we begin by focusing on the case where eq",
    ". holds , either because the mutation rate @xmath1 is small or because the initial fitness distribution @xmath30 is broad .",
    "this regime , the selection of pre - existing variation , is covered by the two limit theorems below .",

    "the first theorem is concerned with initial fitness distributions with unbounded support , i.e. such that @xmath31 .",
    "this condition is the mathematical counterpart of the biological notion of _ positive _ ( or directional ) selection , expressing the idea that ever - higher fitness individuals continuously take over the population at the expense of more common but less fit variants .    if eq",
    ". holds and the initial fitness distribution @xmath30 has unbounded support with @xmath32 for any @xmath33 , then the fitness distribution @xmath0 becomes asymptotically normal as @xmath8 grows .",
    "furthermore , the mean @xmath34 and variance @xmath35 of @xmath0 scale as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the exponent conjugate to @xmath38 , i.e. @xmath39 .",
    "we make several remarks concerning this limit theorem .",
    "first , and in spite of an obvious formal similarity , thm .",
    "1 is _ not _ a consequence of the central limit theorem .",
    "this is apparent from its proof in appendix [ proofs ] , which involves a different kind of asymptotic estimate ; it is also clear from the scaling behavior of the mean @xmath34 and variance @xmath35 : in contrast with the central limit theorem , where the mean and variance are linear functions of the sample size , here @xmath34 and @xmath35 do _ not _ grow with time at the same rate .",

    "1 is a general one , which encompasses many classical distributions ( such as the weibull family ) ; it can moreover be generalized further in terms of the notion of  regular variation at infinity \" @xcite .",
    "third , a lower bound on the rate of convergence of the fitness distribution to the normal type can be estimated as a function of the tail index @xmath38 , see appendix [ proofs ] .    our second theorem deals with the case of fitness distributions with a finite right endpoint @xmath40 , corresponding to the _ negative _ selection of pre - existing variation .",
    "if eq . holds and @xmath30 has a finite right endpoint @xmath41 with @xmath42 for some @xmath43 , then the fitness distribution @xmath0 becomes asymptotically a reversed gamma distribution with shape parameter @xmath44 as @xmath8 grows , i.e. converges in type to the distribution with density function @xmath45}\\big[(1+\\beta)^{1/2}-x\\big]^\\beta \\quad\\textrm{for}\\quad x\\leq ( 1+\\beta)^{1/2}.\\ ] ] furthermore , the variance in fitness @xmath35 eventually decreases as @xmath46    the reversed gamma distributions above interpolate between a reversed exponential distribution for @xmath47 and a normal distribution for @xmath48 . in this sense , the situations of positive selection ( thm . 1 ) and negative selection ( thm .",

    "the nature of evolutionary dynamics in this regime depends on whether these mutations are sometimes beneficial ( positive selection ) or always deleterious or neutral ( negative selection ) .",
    "our next theorem shows that , provided at least some mutations are beneficial , @xmath56 , the fitness distribution converges to the normal type _ for any dfe_. this is a strong form of universality in evolutionary dynamics .    if eq",
    ". holds and at least some mutations are beneficial , @xmath57 , the fitness distributions becomes asymptotically normal as @xmath8 grows independently of the distribution of fitness effects .    finally , the case where all mutations are deleterious or neutral ( @xmath58 ) was treated by eshel in the context of discrete generations @xcite .",

    "note that , unlike the situation in theorems 1 - 3 , which all describe to phases of _ adaptative evolution _ ( the mean fitness increases ) , the mutation - selection balance in theorem 4 does _ not _ lead to universal fitness distributions , except when fitness effects are very small or mutation rates very high .",

    "crucially , this relationship closes the tower of cumulant equations : the mean fitness is determined by the variance in fitness , which is determined by the skewness , which is determined by the kurtosis  which in turn is determined by the skewness .",
    "we have emphasized that robust patterns should not be expected at the level of the mean fitness @xmath34 or the variance in fitness @xmath35 .",

    "in this regime , thm . 1 implies that both @xmath34 and @xmath35 should be _ power - law _ functions of time , with an exponent which depends on the fat - tailedness of the initial fitness distribution ( captured by the tail index @xmath38 ) .",
    "this prediction is at variance with fitness wave theory , which predicts a linear growth of the mean fitness @xcite , but it matches with the results of a long - term evolution experiment with _",
    "e. coli _ @xcite .",
    "whether pre - existing variation in fitness was indeed the main determinant of the fitness gains observed by lenski _",
    "_ , or new mutations did play a critical role in the evolution of _ e. coli _ populations , is unclear to us .    also note that thm .",
    "1 implies the existence of a critical value of the tail index , @xmath97 , below which the variance in fitness _ increases _ under pure selection .",
    "this means that , if the initial distribution of fitness is sufficiently fat - tailed , selection does not necessarily imply a loss of variation in fitness .",
