    "multilayered superconductor / ferromagnet ( @xmath5 structures are under an intensive study now ( for a recent review see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the interest in such systems originates from a possibility to find new physical phenomena as well from the hope to construct new devices based on these structures .",
    "although a ferromagnet f attached to a superconductor s is expected to suppresses the order parameter in s , under certain conditions superconductivity and ferromagnetism may coexist and exhibit interesting phenomena .",
    "one of them is a nonmonotonic dependence of the critical temperature @xmath6 of the superconducting transition in @xmath7 multilayered structures on the thickness @xmath8 of the ferromagnetic layers .",
    "theory of this effect has been developed in refs.@xcite , and experimental results have been presented in refs.@xcite .",
    "another interesting phenomenon is a @xmath9state that can be realized in @xmath10 josephson junctions .",
    "it was shown @xcite that for some values of parameters ( such as the temperature @xmath11 , the thickness @xmath8 , the exchange energy @xmath2 ) the lowest josephson energy corresponds not to the zero phase difference @xmath12 , but to @xmath13 ( negative josephson critical current @xmath14 ) .",
    "detailed theoretical studies of this effect have been presented in many papers @xcite .",
    "the @xmath15-state has been observed experimentally in refs.@xcite .",
    "later it was discovered that the critical current @xmath14 in josephson junctions with ferromagnetic layers is not necessarily suppressed by the exchange interaction and it may even be enhanced .",
    "such an enhancement of @xmath14 has been demonstrated by the present authors on a simple model of a @xmath16 junction , where @xmath17 stands for a thin insulating layer @xcite .",
    "it was shown for thin s and f layers that at low temperatures the critical current @xmath14 in a @xmath16 junction may become even larger than in the absence of the exchange field ( i.e. if the @xmath18 layers are replaced by @xmath19 layers , where @xmath19 is a nonmagnetic metal ) .",
    "more detailed calculations of @xmath14 ( for arbitrary @xmath7 interface transmittance ) for this and similar junctions have been performed later in refs.@xcite .",
    "properties of superconductors in s / f structures may change not only due to the proximity effect but also due to the long - range magnetic interaction .",
    "a spontaneous creation of vortices caused by the magnetic interaction has been predicted in a s / i / f system ( i is an insulating layer)@xcite . in most papers on @xmath7 structures",
    "the case of collinear ( parallel or antiparallel ) orientations of the magnetization @xmath0 was considered .",
    "if the magnetization vector @xmath0 is not constant in space , as in a domain wall , or if the orientations of @xmath3 in different @xmath18 layers are not collinear to each other , a qualitatively new and interesting effect occurs .",
    "for example , if a ferromagnetic wire is attached to a superconductor , a domain wall in the vicinity of the interface can generate a triplet component of the superconducting condensate @xcite ( a similar case was analyzed in a later work @xcite ) .    the existence of the triplet component ( @xmath20 ) has far reaching consequences .",
    "it is well known that the singlet component ( @xmath21 ) penetrates into a ferromagnet over the length @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the diffusion coefficient in @xmath18 .",
    "in contrast , it was shown that even for @xmath24 the @xmath20 penetrated @xmath18 over a much longer distance @xmath25 this long - range penetration of the @xmath20 might lead to an increase of the conductance of the @xmath18 wire if the temperature is lowered below @xmath6@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider a multilayered @xmath7 structure .",
    "each @xmath18 layer has a constant magnetization @xmath0 but the direction of the @xmath0 vector varies from layer to layer .",
    "we show that , in this case , the triplet component of the superconducting condensate is also generated and it penetrates the @xmath18 layers over the long length @xmath26 that does not depend on the large exchange energy @xmath2 at all .",
    "if the thickness of the f layers @xmath8 is much larger than @xmath27 , then the josephson coupling between adjacent @xmath28 layers and , therefore , superconductivity in the transverse direction is due to the @xmath20 . in the vicinity of the @xmath7 interface",
    "the amplitudes of the @xmath21 and @xmath20 may be comparable but , unlike the @xmath20 , the @xmath21 survives in @xmath18 only over the short distance @xmath29 from the @xmath7 interface . in other words , in the multilayered @xmath30 structures with a non - collinear magnetization orientation , a new type of superconductivity arises .",
    "the non - dissipative current within the layers is due to the s - wave singlet superconductivity , whereas the transversal supercurrent across the layers is due to the s - wave , triplet superconductivity .",
    "it is important to emphasize ( see ref.@xcite ) that the @xmath20 in this case differs from the @xmath20 realized in the superfluid he@xmath31 and , for example , in materials like sr@xmath32ruo@xmath33 @xcite .",
    "the triplet - type superconducting condensate we predict here is symmetric in momentum and therefore is insensitive to non - magnetic impurities .",
    "it is odd in frequency and is called sometimes odd superconductivity .",
    "this type of the pairing has been proposed by berezinskii in 1975 @xcite as a possible candidate for the mechanism of superfluidity in he@xmath34 however , it turned out that another type of pairing was realized in he@xmath31 : triplet , odd in momentum @xmath35 ( sensitive to ordinary impurities ) and even in the matsubara frequencies @xmath36 .",
    "attempts to find conditions for the existence of the odd superconductivity were undertaken later in several papers in connection with the pairing mechanism in high @xmath6 superconductors @xcite ( in ref .",
    "@xcite a singlet pairing odd in frequency and in the momentum was considered ) .",
    "it is also important to note that while the symmetry of the order parameter @xmath37 in refs.@xcite differs from that of the bcs order parameter , in our case @xmath37 is nonzero only in the s layers and is of the bcs type .",
    "it is determined by the amplitude of the singlet component . since",
    "the triplet and singlet components are connected which each other , the tc affects @xmath37 in an indirect way .",
    "therefore the type of superconductivity analyzed in our paper complements the three known types of superconductivity : s - wave and d - wave singlet superconductivity that occur in ordinary superconductors and in high @xmath6 superconductors respectively , and the p - wave superconductivity with triplet pairing observed in sr@xmath32ruo@xmath33 .",
    "in addition , the new type of the triplet superconductivity across the @xmath7 layers shows another interesting property related to the chirality of the magnetization @xmath0 . if the angle of the magnetization rotation @xmath38 across the @xmath39 layer ( see fig.[geom2 ] ) has the same sign as the angle of the @xmath3 rotation across the @xmath40 layer , then the critical josephson current @xmath14 between @xmath39 and @xmath40 is positive .",
    "if these angles have different signs , then the critical current @xmath14 is negative and @xmath41 state is realized ( in this case spontaneous supercurrents arise in the structure ) .",
    "this negative josephson coupling , which is caused by the @xmath20 and depends on chirality , differs from that analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite . depending on the chirality an  effective  condensate density in the direction perpendicular to the layers may be both positive and negative .",
    "we note that a dependence of the josephson current on chirality has also been obtained in ref.@xcite .",
    "the authors of ref.@xcite considered two magnetic superconductors @xmath42 with spiral magnetization , separated by a thin insulating layer i. in the latter case the tc exists in the bulk superconductors together with the sc ( and they can not be separated ) and the josephson current depends on the chirality of the spiral structures .",
    "the main difference between our system and the system considered by the authors of ref.@xcite is that in our case only the long - range tc survives in the f layers whereas in the @xmath43 junction both the sc and tc exist simultaneously .",
    "therefore in the case of a collinear alignment of * m * , the josephson coupling ( and triplet superconductivity in the transverse direction ) disappears in our system , whereas it remains in the @xmath43 system .",
    "another possible detection of the tc in the s / f structures may be achieved by measuring the density of states ( dos ) in a f / s / f trilayer ( see fig . [ geom1 ] ) .",
    "we will see that the long - range tc causes a measurable change of the local dos at the outer side of the f layers even if @xmath44 is much larger than @xmath1 .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we make some preliminary remarks concerning the tc in s / f structures .",
    "we consider a three - layer @xmath45 structure and calculate the condensate function in this structure .",
    "we show that the amplitude of the @xmath20 is proportional to @xmath46 and its long - range part is an odd function of the matsubara frequency @xmath36 ( the @xmath21 is an even function of @xmath36 ) , where @xmath47 is the angle between the @xmath48-axis and the magnetization in the right ( left ) @xmath18 layers .",
    "we discuss properties of the @xmath20 and calculate the dos related to it . in sec .",
    "3 we calculate the josephson current between adjacent @xmath28 layers and discuss its dependence on the chirality of the magnetization variation in the system . in sec .",
    "4 we take into account spin - orbit interactions and study the effect of this interaction on the @xmath20 . in the conclusion",
    "we discuss the obtained results and possibilities of an experimental observation of the predicted effects .",
    "the odd triplet superconductivity in @xmath30 structures was first predicted by the present authors in a short paper where the case of small angles @xmath49 and of a perfect @xmath30 interface was considered @xcite .",
    "in order to get a better understanding of the properties of the superconducting condensate in the presence of the ferromagnetic layers , we consider in this section a simple case of a trilayered f / s / f structure ( see fig.[geom1 ] ) .",
    "generalization to a multilayered structures is of no difficulties and will be done in the next section .    in the most general case , when the magnetization vectors @xmath0 of the f - layers are non - collinear , the electron green functions are @xmath50 matrices in the particle - hole@xmath51spin - space@xcite .",
    "the @xmath50 matrix green functions have been introduced long ago @xcite and used in other papers@xcite . later on they were used in ref.@xcite for a description of magnetic superconductors with a rotating magnetization .",
    "a very convenient way for the study of proximity effects is the method of quasiclassical green s functions @xcite .",
    "equations for the quasiclassical green s functions have been generalized recently to the case of a non - homogeneous exchange field ( magnetization ) @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "following the notation of ref.@xcite we represent the quasiclassical green functions in the form @xmath52 where the subscripts @xmath53 and @xmath54 stand for the elements in the particle - hole and spin space , respectively , and @xmath55 is the pauli matrix .",
    "the field operators @xmath56 are defined as @xmath57 and @xmath58 ( @xmath59 denotes the opposite to @xmath54 spin direction ) .",
    "the elements of the matrix @xmath60 diagonal in the particle - hole space ( i.e proportional to @xmath61 and @xmath55 ) are related to the normal green s function , while the off - diagonal elements ( proportional to @xmath62 and @xmath63 ) determine the superconducting condensate function @xmath64 . in the case under consideration the matrix ( [ gf ] )",
    "can be expanded in the pauli matrices in the particle - hole space ( @xmath61 is the unit matrix ) : @xmath65 where the condensate function is given by @xmath66 the functions @xmath67 and @xmath68 are matrices in the spin - space . in the case under consideration the matrices @xmath68 can be represented in the form @xmath69 this follows from the equation that determines the green s function ( see below ) .",
    "let us discuss briefly properties of the condensate matrix function . according to the definitions of the green s functions , eq .",
    "( [ gf ] ) , the functions @xmath70 are related to following correlation functions @xmath71",
    "= 5 cm    the function @xmath72 describes the @xmath21 , while the functions @xmath73 and @xmath74 describe the @xmath20 ( see for example ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the function @xmath73 is proportional to the zero projection of the triplet magnetic moment of the cooper pairs on the z - axis , whereas the function @xmath74 corresponds to the projections @xmath75 .",
    "it is important that in the absence of an exchange field @xmath76 ( or magnetization @xmath0 ) acting on spins , the @xmath21 , i.e. the function @xmath72 , exists both in the superconducting and normal ( non - magnetic ) layers . if @xmath2 is not equal to zero but is uniform in space and directed along the z - axis , then the part @xmath73 of the @xmath20 arises in the structure .    however , both the functions @xmath72 and @xmath73 decay very fast in the ferromagnet ( over the length @xmath77 ) .",
    "the singlet component decays because a strong magnetization makes the spins of a pair be parallel to each other , thus destroying the condensate .",
    "the triplet component with the zero projection of the magnetic moment is also destroyed because it is more energetically favorable for the magnetic moment to be parallel to the magnetization .    on the other hand ,",
    "the structure of the matrix @xmath64 ( the functions @xmath68 ) depends on the choice of the @xmath48-axis . if the uniform magnetization @xmath3 is directed not along the @xmath48-axis ( but , say , along the @xmath78-axis ) , terms like @xmath79 inevitably appear in the condensate function ( see for example , ref.@xcite where such a term was obtained even at @xmath80 , @xmath81 is the wave vector of a spiral magnetic structure ) .",
    "however , the condensate component corresponding to this term penetrates the @xmath18 layer over the short distance @xmath29 only .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that the presence of terms like @xmath79 in the condensate function does not necessarily mean that the @xmath20 penetrates the @xmath18 layer over the long distance @xmath82 .",
    "actually , long - range effects arise only if the direction of the vector @xmath3 varies in space . if the magnetization has different directions in neighboring @xmath18 layers , then not only @xmath73 but also @xmath74 arise in the system and both functions penetrate the ferromagnetic layer over a long distance @xmath82 .    in order to find the green s function @xmath83 , we consider the diffusive case when the usadel equation is applicable .",
    "this equation can be used provided the condition @xmath84 is satisfied ( @xmath85 is the momentum relaxation time ) .",
    "of course , this condition can hardly be satisfied for strong ferromagnets like @xmath86 and in this case one should use a more general eilenberger equation for a quantitative computation .",
    "however , the usadel equation may give qualitatively reasonable results even in this case .",
    "the usadel equation is a nonlinear equation for the 4@xmath874 matrix green s function @xmath83 and can be written as @xmath88 + ij\\left\\{\\left[{\\mbox{$\\hat{\\tau}_3$}}{\\mbox{$\\hat{\\sigma}_3$}},{\\mbox{$\\check{g}$}}\\right ] \\cos\\alpha(x)+\\left[{\\mbox{$\\hat{\\tau}_0$}}{\\mbox{$\\hat{\\sigma}_2$}},{\\mbox{$\\check{g}$}}\\right ] \\sin\\alpha(x)\\right\\}=-i\\left[\\check{\\delta},{\\mbox{$\\check{g}$}}\\right]\\ ; . \\label{usad}\\ ] ] in the s layer @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 ( the phase of @xmath37 is chosen to be zero ) . in the f layers @xmath92 , @xmath93 for the right ( left ) layer and @xmath94 .",

    "we studied odd , s - wave , triplet superconductivity that may arise in s / f multilayered structures with a non - collinear orientation of magnetizations .",
    "it was assumed that the orientation of the magnetization is not affected by the superconductivity ( e.g. the energy of the magnetic anisotropy is much larger than the superconducting energy ) .",
    "the analysis was carried out in the dirty limit ( @xmath206 ) when the usadel equation is applicable .",
    "it was shown that for all values of @xmath168 the condensate function consists of a singlet ( sc ) and a triplet ( tc ) components . even in the case of a homogenous magnetization ( @xmath169 ) , in addition to the sc",
    ", the tc with the zero projection onto the @xmath48 axis arises . in this case , both the sc and the tc decay in the f layers over a short distance given by @xmath289 .",
    "if the magnetization vectors @xmath0 are not collinear @xmath290 , all projections of the tc appear , in particular , those with non - zero projection on the @xmath48-axis . in this case , the tc penetrates the f layer over a long distance @xmath165 . in the presence of spin - orbit interaction this penetration length is given by min(@xmath283 ) , where @xmath291 .",
    "generally , this length may be much larger than @xmath1 .",
    "thus , if the condition @xmath176 is fulfilled the josephson coupling between neighboring s layers is only due to the tc .",
    "therefore in this case a new type of superconductivity may arise in the multilayered structures with non - collinear magnetizations .",
    "the supercurrent within each s layer is caused by the sc , whereas the supercurrent across the layers is caused by the triplet condensate , which is odd in the frequency @xmath162 and even in the momentum .",
    "the tc in our case is completely different from the triplet condensate found in sr@xmath32ruo@xmath33 @xcite . in the latter case one",
    "has a @xmath35-wave , even in @xmath162 , triplet superconductivity , which is suppressed by impurity scattering .",
    "in contrast , the tc we have considered is not affected by non - magnetic impurities .",
    "the reason for the existence of the long - range tc is the fact that if @xmath177 , the sc and the tc are coupled and , in addition to @xmath292 , the eigenvalue @xmath293 appears .",
    "the latter corresponds to the long - range penetration of the tc in the ferromagnet .",
    "the triplet superconductivity in s / f structures possesses an interesting property : the josephson current depends on the chirality of the magnetization @xmath0 : if the @xmath0 vector rotates in only one direction ( the positive chirality ) the critical current @xmath239 is positive . if the direction of the @xmath3 vector oscillates in space ( the negative chirality ) then @xmath294 . in the latter case spontaneously circulating currents must arise in the structure .",
    "this result can be explained as follows : if the chirality is positive the averaged @xmath0 vector @xmath295 is zero and the s / f structure behaves as a superconductor with anisotropic properties ( the singlet superconductivity along the layers and the triplet superconductivity across them ) . in the case of the negative chirality",
    "the average in space yields a non - zero magnetization @xmath296 .",
    "in such a superconductor with a build - in magnetic moment the circulating currents arise as they arise in superconductors of the second type in the mixed state .",
    "note also that in a single josephson fsfsf junction a non - zero magnetic field exists also inside the junction and this causes meissner currents .",
    "however , the experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite on sfs junctions shows that the observed fraunhofer pattern corresponds to @xmath297 in the f layer .",
    "this behavior according to the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite may be attributed to a multi - domain structure .",
    "it would be interesting to carry out experiments on s / f structures with non - collinear magnetization in order to observe this new type of superconductivity . as follows from a semiquantitative analysis ,",
    "the best conditions to observe the josephson critical current caused by the tc are high interface transparency ( small @xmath157 ) and low temperatures .",
    "these conditions are a bit beyond our quantitative study",
    ". nevertheless , all qualitative features predicted here ( angle dependence , etc ) should remain in a general case when one has to deal with the non - linear usadel equation .",
    "another type of experiments that may detect the triplet condensate is measuring the local density of states .",
    "as we have shown in the second section , the long - range tc may be detected by measuring the local dos of the f layers .",
