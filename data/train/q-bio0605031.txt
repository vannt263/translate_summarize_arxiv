    "the mechanism of biomolecular motors is one of the major topics in biophysics . among a number of such systems that have been found so far , the actomyosin motor is of a particular interest , because it is responsible for muscle contraction and cellular movements in eukaryotic cells .",
    "myosin moves unidirectionally along the actin filament using chemical energy released by atp hydrolysis @xcite .",
    "it is widely recognized that the efficiency of this energy conversion is very high compared with macroscopic artificial machines , in spite of the fact that biomolecular motors work under a noisy environment in the cell .",
    "in fact , the free energy released during each atp hydrolysis is only about @xmath0 ; therefore the thermal fluctuation should be appreciable .",
    "although recent progress in imaging and of nanomanipulation has enabled the observation of single molecules , the movement mechanism of the actomyosin motor is still not understood .",
    "there has been a long - standing controversy between the tight - coupling ( lever - arm ) model and the loose - coupling model .",
    "x - ray crystallographic studies have revealed that the angle of the neck domain changes relative to the motor domain , depending on the nucleotide state . the `` lever - arm '' model was proposed based on these observations , in which the structural change of myosin is tightly coupled with the atp hydrolysis cycle , and directly causing a stepwise sliding motion .",
    "it was shown , however , that the sliding distance of the myosin along the actin filament per atp at the muscle contraction can be much longer than the displacement predicted by the lever - arm - like structural change of a single myosin molecule @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is questionable whether a material as soft as proteins can accurately switch its conformation in the same way as a macroscopic machine under thermal fluctuation .    in the `` loose - coupling '' model , in contrast , the structural change does not always correspond to a step in a one - to - one correspondence ; the motion is intrinsically stochastic and thermal fluctuation is an essential ingredient for its mechanism @xcite .",
    "the simplest class of models that produce the loose - coupling mechanism is based on a thermal ratchet , in which a myosin molecule is treated as a brownian particle that moves along a periodic and asymmetric potential under both thermal noise and non - thermal perturbations @xcite .",
    "although ratchet systems can , in fact , exhibit unidirectional flow in a noisy environment , a high efficiency comparable to that of the actomyosin system is found difficult to achieve using only a simple ratchet system .",
    "even if the ratchet models do to express some essence of the mechanism of the biomolecular motor , they are too much simplified and we should say that the connection with the real actomyosin system is rather vague .",
    "in particular , since the myosin is expressed as a particle , the effect of its conformational change is , at best , only implicitly taken into account .",
    "a somewhat more realistic modelling is desirable , which can reflect the chain conformation .",
    "recently , it was revealed by single molecule experiments that the chemomechanical cycle of the myosin head is controlled by a load on the actomyosin crossbridge @xcite .",
    "the observation suggested that the rate of adp release from the myosin head depends on the force acting on myosin ; namely , the chemical reaction rate varies with the deformation of the myosin .",
    "if the myosin head indeed acts as such a `` strain sensor , '' this would be reminiscent of a classical model by a. huxley @xcite ; in this model , the myosin head is supposed to undergo brownian motion and change into a tightly bound state to the actin filament triggered by a structure dependent chemical reaction .",
    "the relationship between structure and function of proteins has long been investigated . thus far ,",
    "mainly the static aspects of proteins have been considered , for example , the classical `` lock and key '' model of an enzyme .",
    "recently , the role of structural fluctuations , or that of a more drastic structural change , including `` partial unfolding , '' on protein functions has become a subject of growing interest .",
    "although there have been many experimental studies to clarify the dynamical processes of protein at a functional level , it is still difficult to observe the structural changes with high resolution in both space and time .",
    "computer simulations serve as possible alternatives .",
    "typical computational studies treated equilibrium fluctuations near a crystal structure using the all - atom model @xcite or the elastic network model @xcite ; although these types of simulations can not deal with large - scale structural change , the low - frequency fluctuation modes were found to be consistent with the direction of motion of the structural change associated with the function .",
    "some attempts have been made to simulate a larger structural change beyond the elastic regime using a class of models called the g - like model @xcite . according to the recently developed theory of spontaneous protein folding",
    ", the protein energy landscape has a funnel - like global shape toward the native structure .",
    "the g - like model is certainly the simplest class of models that can realize a funnel - like landscape @xcite and has successfully described the folding process of small proteins .",
    "it is , however , not suitable for the study of a change between two conformations , because only the interaction between the pairs of residues that contact each other in the native state are taken into account ; the conformation other than the native state becomes too unstable as a result .",
    "thus , a model is desirable in which two conformations can be embedded . here",
    ", we introduce a new model bearing this property as a variant of the g - like model .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the dynamics of the myosin conformational change from the pre - power stroke state to the near - rigor state by molecular dynamics simulations of a coarse - grained protein .",
    "this process is called `` power stroke '' because the angle of the lever - arm changes remarkably , and it is considered in the lever - arm model that this structural change directly causes the force generation . to describe the structural change , we propose the `` dual g - model . ''",
    "the dissociation process of the nucleotide that accompanies the conformational change is also involved in the simulation by introducing a coarse - grained nucleotide . to our knowledge",
    ", the ligand at the binding site has not been considered explicitly in coarse - grained protein simulations , possibly because the primary role of atp is considered to be the release of chemical energy through hydrolysis , and the excluded volume effect of the molecule has not been investigated .",
    "we , however , consider that the presence or absence of nucleotides in the binding site would profoundly affect the structural fluctuation of the protein .",
    "therefore , it is important to perform simulations including the nucleotide .",
    "first , we introduce the dual g - model . while only the native structure is taken as a reference structure for the potential energy function in the standard g - like models , the dual g - like model takes two reference structures , structure 1 and structure 2 , in the effective potential . for the interaction between `` native - contact '' pairs ,",
    "each potential energy function has two minima corresponding to two reference structures . to study the relaxation process from structure 2 to structure 1 , the minimum corresponding to structure 2",
    "is given a slightly higher energy than that of structure 1 to make structure 1 more stable .",
    "in this study , we used a model based on one of the c@xmath1 g - like models @xcite , which involves local interactions such as bond length , bond angle , and dihedral angle interactions as well as the native - contact interaction .",
    "for these local interactions , we set that each potential energy function has two minima of the same depth corresponding to two reference structures .    as reference structures ,",
    "we choose x - ray crystallography structures of _ dictyostelium discoideum _ myosin ii : the near - rigor structure without nucleotide , 1q5 g @xcite for structure 1 and the pre - power stroke structure with adp@xmath2p@xmath3 analog , 1vom @xcite for structure 2 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : x - ray_structures ] ) .",
    "the initial structure is the pre - power stroke structure with a coarse - grained nucleotide ( fig .",
    "[ fig : atp ] ) located at the nucleotide - binding site .",
    "typical time courses of the distance root mean square deviation ( drmsd ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : time_courses ] for ( a ) @xmath4 and ( b ) @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the strength parameter of the protein - nucleotide interaction .",
    "the drmsd from the near - rigor structure is defined as @xmath7 in which @xmath8 is the distance between c@xmath1 carbons of the @xmath9th and @xmath10th residues in the given conformation , and @xmath11 indicates their distance in the near - rigor structure . at the initial conformation",
    ", the drmsd of @xmath12 3.9 , and decreases rapidly to @xmath12 3 , and stays there for a while .",
    "the conformation eventually relaxes into the final state , drmsd @xmath12 1.5 .",
    "this final state is actually the near - rigor state , judging from its average structure ; in fact , the drmsd of the average structure is @xmath12 1 . in short ,",
    "the myosin motor domain in the pre - power stroke conformation relaxes at first into the intermediate state and then to the near - rigor conformation .",
    "we introduced an index to characterize the state of the nucleotide binding , @xmath13 ; we count how many of the nucleotide contacts that is formed in structure 2 ( the pre - power stroke ) remain in a given conformation , @xmath14 .",
    "then , @xmath13 is defined as this number divided by the number of nucleotide contacts in structure 2 .",
    "@xmath15 1 when a nucleotide is bound , and @xmath16 if the nucleotide - binding site is empty .",
    "the time courses of @xmath17 are also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : time_courses ] .",
    "the structural relaxation occurs after or , at the earliest , at the same time as the nucleotide dissociation .",
    "furthermore , the relaxation tends to synchronize with the dissociation as @xmath6 increases . to clarify the @xmath6 dependency of the synchronization",
    ", we plotted the histograms of @xmath18 and of @xmath19 from 200 independent runs for each value of @xmath6 , where @xmath18 is the number of steps taken before the nucleotide dissociates , @xmath20 is the number of steps taken before the conformation relaxes to the near - rigor state , and @xmath21 is the delay in the relaxation after the dissociation takes place ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hist_diff ] ) .    for small @xmath6 ,",
    "both the histograms of both @xmath18 and of @xmath21 show exponential decay ; thus , the nucleotide dissociation and the relaxation of the myosin conformation are considered to be decoupled . for larger @xmath6 , on the other hand ,",
    "the histogram of @xmath18 can not be fitted to an exponential decay .",
    "in addition , the average of @xmath18 is shifted to the right and the delays , @xmath21 become shorter ; in other words , the nucleotide is unbound later and the conformational relaxation tends to occur immediately after the nucleotide dissociation . for @xmath22 ,",
    "dissociation and relaxation occur nearly simultaneously in over 60% of 200 trajectories .",
    "note that apparent `` @xmath23 cases '' are caused simply from the numerical ambiguity of @xmath18 and @xmath20 and actually correspond to coincidental dissociation - relaxation .",
    "the largest difference between the intermediate state and the initial ( pre - power stroke ) conformation is the position of the converter domain with respect to the other subdomains ; the relative positions among other subdomains ( for example , the n terminal and the 50-kda subdomain ) are similar to those in the pre - power stroke conformation . the average drmsd of the intermediate state varies slightly with the parameter @xmath6 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : nucl_constraint ] ) , reflecting little difference in the position of the converter relative to the other subdomains .",
    "some of the native contacts of structure 1 are not formed until the conformation finally relaxes to the near - rigor state .",
    "figure [ fig : contact_drmsd_corr ] shows the residues included in these contacts .",
    "they are concentrated at the boundary between the n terminal and the 50-kda subdomain , that is , the region around the nucleotide - binding site .",
    "thus , the final relaxation process consists of a rearrangement of the n terminal subdomain against the other part .",
    "as already mentioned , the myosin motor domain relaxes to the near - rigor conformation only after the dissociation of the nucleotide and not before .",
    "thus , it seems that the nucleotide must be unbound for the final relaxation to occur .",
    "this observation leads to a speculation that the nucleotide blocks the deformation of myosin around the nucleotide - binding site by its volume . to investigate the case of",
    "when the nucleotide can not dissociate , we attempted a nucleotide - free and constrained simulation . in this simulation , instead of treating the nucleotide molecule explicitly , we connected the residues that would contact with the nucleotide by virtual bonds , to force the nucleotide - binding site to keep the pre - power stroke form .",
    "figure [ fig : nucl_constraint ] shows the time courses obtained by the simulations .",
    "we find that the conformation remains at the intermediate state and that the relaxation toward the near - rigor state is not completed .",
    "the relaxation simulation using coarse - grained myosin and the nucleotide have shown that the myosin motor domain does not relax to the near - rigor conformation before the nucleotide dissociates .",
    "@xcite showed by simultaneous observation of adp release and mechanical events that force is generated at the same time as or several hundreds of milliseconds after the dissociation of adp .",
    "our results are consistent with their experimental findings if force generation is preceded by structural relaxation .",
    "moreover , the results from the simulations in which the conformation of the nucleotide - binding site is constrained also indicate that the relaxation is indeed prevented if the nucleotide can not dissociate .    based on these observations",
    ", we now suggest that the primary role of the nucleotide in the `` power stroke '' process is to suppress relaxation through blocking deformation around the nucleotide - binding site by its volume . in this scenario ,",
    "hydrolysis is required to alter the affinity of the nucleotide to the binding site .",
    "in particular , our simulations have shown that the structural relaxation is synchronous with nucleotide dissociation when the nucleotide is tightly bound to the myosin head .",
    "in other words , the nucleotide dissociates cooperatively with the motion of the subdomain .",
    "this strong coupling of deformation and dissociation seems to be relevant to the function of the `` strain sensor , '' in which nucleotide dissociation is controlled by the strain induced by an external force .",
    "the correlation depends on the binding strength , @xmath6 ; the relaxation is only loosely coupled with the dissociation for weak binding conditions .",
    "the origin of a large kinetic diversity among myosins may be attributed to this binding strength dependence .",
    "the intermediate state observed in the relaxation process should also be discussed .",
    "although several intermediate states have been revealed by kinetic experiments@xcite , their structural aspects , except for adp@xmath2p@xmath3 state , are little known .",
    "et al_. @xcite reported , from their fret study , that there are two `` pre - power stroke '' conformations ; while one conformation corresponds to the crystal structure of the complex with the adp@xmath2p@xmath3 analog , the other conformation has not yet been observed using crystallography .",
    "we found that the average structure of the intermediate state observed in the present study is consistent with the latter conformation .",
    "our dual g model is effective in studying myosin conformational changes .",
    "recently , a similar approach was proposed for a monte carlo simulation of a lattice protein , in which a double - square - well potential for native - contact pairs was introduced@xcite .",
    "this type of model , in which two conformations are embedded in an energy potential function , will be useful in understanding the dynamics of protein conformational change .",
    "our dual g - model is a variant of the c@xmath1 g - like model @xcite .",
    "a protein chain is formed , consisting of spherical beads that represent c@xmath1 atoms of amino acid residues connected by virtual bonds . in conventional g - like models ,",
    "only amino acid pairs that contact in the native conformation are assigned an effective energy . in the dual g - model ,",
    "on the other hand , the effective energy function takes two reference structures , structure 1 and structure 2 . a nucleotide molecule is also expressed as a chain of connected beads .",
