    "intriguing properties of vacuum as viewed by accelerated observers have been the subject of intense investigation for almost three decades .",
    "one of the most remarkable results is the so - called fulling - unruh effect predicted and analyzed by davies , fulling , unruh and dewitt @xcite , and others @xcite .",
    "in essence , it was shown that ground state atoms , accelerated through vacuum , are promoted to an excited state just as if they were in contact with a blackbody thermal field .",
    "these studies predict that a ( two - level ) ground state atom , having transition frequency @xmath0 , and experiencing a constant acceleration @xmath1 , will be excited to its upper level with a probability governed by the boltzmann factor @xmath2 , where @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the speed of light in vacuum .",
    "unfortunately , even for very large acceleration  frequency \" @xmath5 @xmath6 hz @xcite , and microwave frequency @xmath0 @xmath7 hz @xcite , this factor is exponentially small , @xmath8 ; and is not of experimental interest .    to begin with",
    ", we note that the physical picture of the unruh effect in any setting is quite straightforward . in particular",
    ", it is the counter - rotating terms in the interaction hamiltonian that describe the process of an excitation of an atom with simultaneous emission of a photon ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "( a ) resonant absorption or emission : an atom is excited ( deexcited ) as it simultaneously absorbs ( emits ) a photon . ( b ) counter - resonant absorption or emission processes that are usually neglected in the `` rotating wave approximation '' : an atom is excited ( deexcited ) as it simultaneously emits ( absorbs ) a photon .",
    "( c ) the energy for counter - resonant emission is drawn from work done by a force accelerating an atom .",
    "( d ) atoms or ions in their ground state @xmath9 are accelerated through a single - mode microwave or optical cavity . ]",
    "furthermore , it is known that many effects related to the interaction of atoms with the electromagnetic field acquire new features or are enhanced in the cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) setting , when the atoms are injected into a high - q cavity .",
    "thus we were motivated to study a simple _ gedanken _ experiment with a beam of atoms in their ground state that are accelerated through a single - mode microwave cavity @xcite ; see fig .  1 .",
    "this model is sufficiently simple so that we are able not only to find the probabilities of a photon emission and absorption by ground state atoms , but also to solve the density matrix equation for the photons in the cavity mode interacting with a beam of atoms and to analyze its steady state solutions .",
    "we found that the radiation is thermal ( in the typical case ) and the effective  boltzmann factor \" can be much larger than the above exponentially small value @xcite .",
    "in particular , for the above example it is given by @xmath10 , which is of order @xmath11 .",
    "hence , it is many orders of magnitude larger than that for the usual unruh effect and is potentially observable .",
    "we find that the mechanism of simultaneous excitation of both field and atom in a cavity is the same as for the unruh effect in free space .",
    "we show that in both cases it is the nonadiabatic transition due to the counter - rotating term @xmath12 in the interaction hamiltonian ( [ inter ] ) .",
    "the reason for an enhanced excitation in the cavity is the relatively large amplitude for a quantum transition @xmath13 between the dressed atomic states due to the sudden nonadiabatic switching on of the interaction at the cavity boundaries , whereas for the unruh effect in free space the emission is exponentially small due to a slow switching on . in both cases",
    "nonadiabatic effects , however small they are , play a critical role : there is quite a real emission of a photon accompanied by the excitation of an atom  not just dressing of the ground state of an atom as a result of interaction . as was shown in @xcite , when the cavity boundaries are removed , our expressions yield the usual unruh result .    other processes where counter - rotating terms play a crucial role include , e.g. parametric resonance and the anomalous doppler effect . the similarity between the unruh effect and the anomalous doppler effect ,",
    "in which an atom moving faster than the velocity of light in a medium is also excited to an upper state while simultaneously emitting a photon , has been emphasized in @xcite . in both cases the energy for the excitation of an atom and emission of a photon",
    "is taken from the work done by the force supporting the motion of an atom along the given trajectory .",
    "however , for the doppler effect there are no time - changing parameters : the excitation occurs due to the existence of the cerenkov resonance .    in section",
    "ii we formulate the model and write down the hamiltonian . in section",
    "iii the transition probabilities for emission are shown to yield a simple physical picture of the unruh radiation .",
    "next , the master equation is derived and the steady - state solution for the photon density matrix is derived and analyzed . in sections iv - vi we analyze the mechanism of emission and absorption by the accelerated atoms and its relation to the standard unruh effect .",
    "the emission and absorption probabilities are calculated .",
    "the resulting integrals are evaluated by the method of stationary phase in all physically interesting asymptotic limits .",
    "the possibility of amplification and laser action is discussed .",
    "the interpretation of the results and discussion are presented in section vii .",

    "thus , when the acceleration shifts the frequency @xmath222 further away from the resonance ( e.g. when @xmath223 for the co - propagating wave or when @xmath224 for the counter - propagating wave ) , the emission - to - absorption ratio is increasing .",
    "in this case the effect of acceleration results in the increase of the steady - state number of photons in the cavity as compared to the constant velocity case .",
    "this tendency is of course reversed when the frequency is shifted towards the resonance by acceleration . at the same time , in the case of a constant acceleration we can also have the situation when the atom starts far from resonance , then passes through resonance in the course of acceleration , and finally ends up far from the resonance . in this case",
    "the ratio @xmath191 can be quite large and given by @xmath225 , while for an atom moving with a constant velocity and close to resonance @xmath226 the ratio @xmath191 is very small due to a strongly enhanced absorption .",
    "thus , depending on the initial conditions , acceleration can lead to either increase or decrease in the emission - to - absorption ratio .",

    "( [ vconst1]),([vconst2 ] ) strongly depends also on the interference factors @xmath227 that are defined by the time of flight @xmath188 , i.e. the phase an atom accumulates relative to the cavity mode while passing through the cavity .",
    "the ratio @xmath191 can be even greater than one . to achieve @xmath228",
    ", one can tune the time of flight to get the proper interference factors : @xmath229 where @xmath230 are integer numbers .",
    "for the particular case @xmath231 one obtains @xmath232 .",
    "the monochromaticity of the beam should satisfy the condition @xmath233 where @xmath234 , @xmath235 is a cavity length , and we assumed @xmath236 .",
    "for @xmath237 km / s and @xmath238 one gets @xmath239 , which is tough but possible to satisfy .",
    "the counter - propagating mode is more favorable for the gain since the absorption can then be anomalously small while the gain remains as large as for the co - propagating mode .",
    "similar interference effects , obviously , are present in the case of a constant acceleration according to eqs .",
    "( [ int ] ) , ( [ gamma ] ) , ( [ b ] ) , and ( [ s ] ) , as can be seen in figs .  1 - 3 .",
    "they can also lead to the net gain , as we have already discussed .    in the case of a parametric resonance , consider an atom moving along an oscillating trajectory @xmath240 , @xmath241 .",
    "the photon absorption and emission probabilities by a ground - state atom ( [ pem ] ) are given by @xmath242 where we introduced a small factor @xmath243 describing the atomic decay .",
    "using @xmath244 the above probabilities can be written as @xmath245 where @xmath246 is bessel s function .",
    "evidently , the probabilities are sharply peaked close to parametric resonance , where @xmath247 .",
    "resonance for emission corresponds to @xmath248 , while the absorption resonance is at @xmath249 .",
    "when @xmath250 , absorption is always stronger than emission .",
    "indeed , resonance in absorption exists for @xmath251 , while parametric resonance in emission requires @xmath252 .",
    "therefore , in this case @xmath253 for @xmath252 .",
    "however , when an atom is not at resonance with the field , one can have parametric resonance in emission but no resonance in absorption , which results in the parametric gain .",
    "the energy is drawn from the external force causing an atom to follow an oscillating trajectory , and the high efficiency of this energy transfer is due to a non - stationary , strongly nonadiabatic character of the atomic center - of - mass motion . in the case of unruh effect ,",
    "i.e. a uniformly accelerated atom in free space , it is also nonadiabaticity that drives simultaneous excitation of the atom and the field",
    ". however , the efficiency is much lower due to much slower change in the atomic velocity . for an atom entering the cavity , a sudden nonadiabatic switch - on of the interaction",
    "causes a stronger excitation .",
    "the above calculations clearly show that the mechanism of simultaneous excitation of both field and atom is the same as for the unruh effect in free space , namely nonadiabatic transition due to the counter - rotating term @xmath254 in the interaction hamiltonian ( [ inter ] ) , i.e. @xmath255 .",
    "the reason for an enhanced excitation in the cavity is the relatively large amplitude for a quantum transition @xmath13 due to the sudden nonadiabatic switching on of the interaction , whereas for the unruh effect in free space the emission is exponentially small due to a slow switching on .",
    "however , in both cases there is quite a real emission of a photon accompanied by the excitation of an atom  not just dressing of the ground state of an atom as a result of interaction .",
    "we will now illustrate the above statement by explicit derivation of both the unruh factor and the enhanced excitation factor as a probability of the nonadiabatic transition from the dressed ground state to the dressed excited state .",
    "consider first our case of a sudden turn on of the interaction in cavity qed . as a result of the interaction ,",
    "the initial state @xmath256 is no longer an eigenstate of the hamiltonian .",
    "now , a linear superposition of the excited states of the atom and field makes up the dressed @xcite ground state of the interacting system @xmath257 in @xmath258 is of the order of @xmath259 .",
    "it is easy to calculate that the latter corresponds to the atomic excitation probability @xmath260 , where the emission integral @xmath139 is defined above .",
    "this result can be also obtained directly from the density matrix equation for the atom , via the atomic counterpart to eq .",
    "( [ master ] ) with a trace over the photon states instead of the tr@xmath102 .",
    "this probability has the same origin and value as the well - known bloch - siegert shift of a two - level atomic transition @xcite , @xmath261 , due to counter - rotating terms in the interaction hamiltonian .",
    "the counter - rotating term in eq .  ( [ b ] ) represents the contribution from boundaries to the nonadiabatic transition amplitudes . in the absence of the boundary contributions , the emission integral @xmath262 in eq .",
    "( [ b ] ) becomes exponentially small @xmath263 for the small parameter @xmath264 since there are no stationary phase points in the integration interval .",
    "the absorption integral @xmath134 does have a point of stationary phase when the atomic frequency @xmath0 is brought into resonance with the field due to the time - dependent doppler shift of the mode frequency @xcite @xmath265 .",
    "this fact explains why the related exponential factor effectively disappears from the absorption integral ( [ s ] ) when @xmath266 . as a result ,",
    "if there are no edge effects , we obtain the same excitation factor @xmath267 as in the unruh effect ( in free space ) .",
    "this means that in order to observe the standard unruh result one has to extend the mode profile @xmath268 near the boundaries , i.e. , eliminate nonadiabatic boundary contributions .",
    "similary to what we did for the sudden turn - on case , let us now demonstrate the nonadiabatic nature of the unruh effect by the following explicit derivation of the unruh factor as a probability of the nonadiabatic transition @xmath269 from the dressed ground state .",
    "the shroedinger equation @xmath270 in the two - level case @xmath271 yields @xmath272 .",
    "the difference between the eigenenergies is , to the first order , @xmath273 . for small nonadiabatic coupling @xmath274 ,",
    "the perturbation solution is @xmath275 \\frac{d}{d\\tau^{\\prime}}\\left(\\frac{g(\\tau^{\\prime})}{\\omega + \\nu^{\\prime}}\\right)\\ , d\\tau'|^2 $ ] .",
    "if we now make the assumption of an adiabatic switching ( on and off ) of the interaction @xmath276 as in standard unruh effect treatments , then after integration by parts the latter integral is reduced to the integral @xmath262 in eqs .",
    "( 6 ) but in the infinite limits , i.e. without edge effects .",
    "this yields the standard unruh factor @xmath277 .",
    "this derivation clearly shows the dramatic effect of boundary contributions leading to a large amplitude @xmath278 of the atomic excited state @xmath279 .",
    "only if we eliminate the edge effects by adiabatic switching of the interaction do we retrieve the exponentially small excitation factor .",
    "note that in the cavity the excitation factor @xmath280 is determined by the first power of the same nonadiabaticity parameter @xmath225 .",
    "the reason for this effect is the existence of a true resonance , i.e. , a stationary - phase point , in the absorption coefficient . as mentioned earlier , this yields a resonance between the atomic transition frequency and the doppler - shifted frequency of the field seen by the atom , @xmath281 , and is responsible for the aforementioned effect .",
    "our simple model clearly demonstrates that the ground state atoms accelerated through a vacuum - state cavity radiate real photons .",
    "for relatively small acceleration @xmath282 , the excitation boltzman factor @xmath283 is much larger than the standard unruh factor @xmath284 .",
    "the physical origin of the field energy in the cavity and of the real internal energy in the atom is , of course , the work done by an external force driving the center - of - mass motion of the atom against the radiation reaction force . both the present effect ( in a cavity ) and standard unruh effect ( in free space ) originate from the transition of the ground state atom to the excited state with simultaneous emission of photon due to the counter - rotating term @xmath285 in the time - dependent hamiltonian ( 9 ) .",
    "thus , these effects have essentially the same counter - resonant , nonadiabatic mechanism .",
    "we emphasize that there is emission of real photons in both cases ; however the emission probability is exponentially small for the standard unruh condition of the absence of boundaries and slow turn - on of the interaction  simply because the nonadiabatic effect is very small in the latter case .",
    "the enhanced rate of emission into the cavity mode comes from the enhanced nonadiabatic transition at the cavity boundaries ; the standard unruh excitation comes from the nonadiabatic transition in free space due to the time dependence of the doppler - shifted field frequency @xmath286 , as seen by the atom in the course of acceleration .",
