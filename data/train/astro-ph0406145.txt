    "the fact that the magellanic stream is seen only in neutral hydrogen and not stars has led to some debate over whether ram - pressure stripping or tidal forces are at play @xcite .",
    "the best example of an ongoing accretion event in the milky way is the sagittarius dwarf satellite galaxy @xcite with its associated tidal debris @xcite .",
    "more recently , sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) stellar density maps have revealed that the low - luminosity , remote star cluster palomar  5 is undergoing tidal disruption @xcite .",
    "sdss and two - micron all - sky survey data have led to the discovery and characterization of the monoceros stream , an arc - like structure at low galactic latitude that is probably the result of an encounter with a dwarf galaxy @xcite .",
    "the monoceros stream and other milky way structures like it are only just being identified : their large angular extent requires the use of wide - field surveys .",
    "moreover followup studies of these structures can prove to be difficult from our vantage point within the galaxy s disk .",
    "in contrast to the milky way , its neighbor , the andromeda spiral galaxy ( m31 ) , offers certain advantages for halo studies : its disk is highly inclined , we have a global external perspective of the galaxy , and yet it is close enough to allow us to characterize the properties of individual stars in detail . @xcite and @xcite present star - count maps covering a large area around m31 and find a giant stream extending to its south ( hereafter referred to as the ` giant southern stream ' ) along with several other signs of disturbance in the halo and outer disk . while the giant southern stream appears to be tidal debris from a merger event , the origin / nature of the other features is not clear .",
    "an investigation of m31 s innermost satellites by @xcite confirms the presence of tidally - distorted outer isophotes in ngc  205 and revealed ongoing stripping in m32 , with the amount of mass lost estimated to be of the same order as that seen in the stream .",

    "candidate rgb stars in m31 s giant southern stream were selected from the field  ` a3 ' photometry / astrometry catalog of @xcite . the catalog is based on kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) 4-meter telescope and mosaic camera images in the washington system @xmath8 and @xmath9 bands as well as the intermediate - width @xmath0 band .",

    "the field center is located @xmath15  ( east ) and @xmath16  ( south ) with respect to m31 s center . only a portion of the field , the southwest or lower right half , is on the stream : the northeast edge of the stream runs more or less diagonally across field  ` a3 ' from northwest to southeast .",
    "it should be noted that the surface density of luminous m31 rgb stars is quite low in this remote field , even in the on - stream portion , and there is substantial foreground and background contamination ( see  [ sec : success ] ) .",
    "the @xmath0 filter has a passband of width @xmath17 centered at @xmath18 , designed to include the surface - gravity - sensitive mgi triplet and mgh stellar absorption features @xcite .",
    "the features are strong in dwarf stars but weak in rgb stars .",

    "the @xmath19 parameter is effective in guiding the selection of rgb stars and in reducing greatly dwarf contamination in the sample , but it is not a perfect discriminant at the relatively faint magnitudes of our survey ( as will be shown in  [ sec : reject_ddo51 ] below ) : metallicity variations cause rgb stars to have a relatively broad distribution in two - color space and the few more metal - rich ones that happen to intersect the dwarf locus are assigned a low @xmath19 value ; moreover , rgb ( dwarf ) stars in the tails of the photometric error distribution can scatter close to ( far from ) the dwarf locus and would then be assigned a low ( high ) @xmath19 value .",
    "since metallicity is a secondary parameter ( after surface gravity ) in determining the strength of the mgb and mgh features , one might worry about @xmath0 selection introducing a bias against metal - rich rgb stars .",
    "we will examine this issue in ",
    "[ sec : feh_bias ] below and show that such a bias is not important for our sample .",
    "the object detection algorithm in daophot tends to reject sources that are extended relative to the point spread function but some background field galaxies , especially compact ones , do slip through into the object catalog .",
    "the two - color method described above tends to assign high @xmath19 values to galaxies because they are dominated by the light of rgb stars and/or because their mgb / mgh features are redshifted out of the @xmath0 passband making them appear featureless . for this reason",
    "the @xmath19 criterion is supplemented by the daophot - based morphological criteria chi and sharp to reject galaxies .",

    "this was changed to @xmath50 for mask  # 3 and the rest of the fall 2003 masks from our deimos survey ( not presented here ) to avoid the possibility of losing one of the caii triplet lines in the inter - ccd gap and to extend the blue side coverage to the @xmath51 tio and @xmath52 h@xmath53 features . the 1200  lines  mm@xmath2 grating yields a dispersion of @xmath54  pix@xmath2 and the spatial scale is @xmath55  pix@xmath2 . the @xmath56 array of @xmath57 ccds span a spectral range of about @xmath58 and a total slitmask length of over @xmath59 .",

    "the width of the mask ( in the dispersion direction ) over which slitlets are distributed is about 2000  pix so the exact spectral coverage varies from slitlet to slitlet by up to a few hundred   ; moreover , some spectra are truncated by vignetting ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : spec_indiv ] ) .",

    "the actual resolution is slightly better than this : for typical seeing of @xmath65 ( fwhm ) , the spectral resolution is @xmath66 which corresponds to 44  km  s@xmath2 or @xmath67 at the caii triplet .",
    "while this is the characteristic width of stellar absorption lines , the precision with which the centroid of a line can be determined is typically a small fraction of its width . the centroiding accuracy , and hence the radial velocity measurement error (  [ sec : vel_error ] ) , depends on the s / n ratio or , more specifically , on the significance of the cross - correlation peak @xcite .    prior to starting spectroscopic exposures on each slitmask",
    ", we used the mask alignment procedure developed by the deep2 team : guide stars on the tv guider camera were used for coarse alignment ; direct images were then obtained through the mask with the grating in zeroth order to fine tune the alignment ( both position angle and translation ) .",
    "the procedure converged after 23  iterations with typical residuals of @xmath68 between the position of the alignment star and the center of its alignment box .",
    "this is indicative of the level of astrometric precision in the @xcite catalog from which our spectroscopic targets were drawn .",
    "the three  deimos masks in field  ` a3 ' were processed through the spec2d software pipeline ( version  1.1.4 ) developed by the deep2 team at the university of california - berkeley ( ucb ) for that survey .",

    "the flat field exposures are used to rectify the curved spectra in the raw spectrogram into rectangular arrays by applying shifts in the spatial direction .",
    "next , a one - dimensional ( 1d ) slit function correction and two - dimensional ( 2d ) flat - field and fringing correction are applied to each slitlet . using the deimos optical model as a starting point",
    ", a 2d wavelength solution is determined from the arc lamp exposures with residuals of order @xmath69 .",
    "each slitlet is then 2d sky - subtracted exposure by exposure using a b - spline model for the sky .",
    "the individual exposures of the slitlet are then averaged with cosmic - ray rejection and inverse - variance weighting .",
    "finally 1d spectra are extracted for all science targets using the optimal scheme of @xcite and converted to plain text format using standard iraf tasks .",
    "the 1d spectra shown in figure  [ fig : spec_indiv ] represent the top one - third of our stellar sample in terms of  s / n : typically @xmath70 at the caii triplet for this subset .",
    "the spectra have been normalized to unit flux at @xmath64 ; they are not flux calibrated and the telluric a - band feature is still present ( it will be removed in future versions of the data processing pipeline ) .",
    "boxcar smoothing , with a 10  pix ( @xmath71 ) window and inverse - variance weighting , has been applied to the spectra for illustration purposes .",
    "the deimos spectra presented here are generally of higher quality than the lris spectra in the rg02 study , even though the latter typically had @xmath72 longer exposure times ( compare fig .  [",
    "fig : spec_indiv ] to their fig .  1 ) .",
    "the most significant improvement is poisson - limited subtraction of the bright night sky emission lines that plague the caii triplet region .",
    "improved sky subtraction is the result of three  features of deimos : ( i )  a closed - loop flexure compensation system ; ( ii )  ccds that lack fringing in the far red ; and ( iii )  a fine enough pixel scale to sample the line spread function well , including the sharp slit edges .",
    "moreover deimos has a higher net throughput than lris in this wavelength regime and its spectral coverage is wider than the red side of lris .",
    "in addition to these improvements in quality , deimos roughly @xmath73 larger slitmask area allows a higher degree of multiplexing than lris .",
    "the extracted 1d spectra were processed through the spec1d pipeline developed for the deep2 survey at ucb ( an adaptation of the corresponding sdss pipeline ) .",
    "the pipeline cross - correlates the spectrum of each science target against a series of stellar templates spanning a range of spectral types and emission- and absorption - line galaxy templates to determine the redshift .",
    "the science and template spectra are continuum - subtracted and the science spectrum is interpolated to the resolution of the template : @xmath74 .",
    "the cross - correlation is computed in pixel space ( i.e. ,  real space as opposed to fourier space ) with the relative line strengths and line widths held fixed .",
    "the software shifts and scales the template to find the best fit in reduced-@xmath75 space .",
    "the galaxy templates used in the fitting procedure are linear combinations of the emission- and absorption - line templates whereas the various stellar templates are used individually in the fit .",
    "the 10  best solutions for the redshift @xmath76 of each object are reported , arranged in order of increasing reduced-@xmath75 .",
    "we used the visual inspection software zspec , developed by d.  madgwick et  al .  at ucb for the deep2 survey , to view the sky - subtracted 2d and 1d spectra of each slitlet / science target . the extraction window used by the spec2d pipeline  i.e .",

    "the night sky spectrum , or more precisely the variance versus wavelength , is plotted along side the target s 1d spectrum ; it proved to be very useful in deciding which spectral features were reliable and which ones were not .",
    "different degrees of smoothing were tried on the target s 1d spectrum to enhance the s / n at the cost of spectral resolution  this afforded a better view of its spectral features and allowed us to assess the reality of marginal / weak ones .    for about half the targets from masks  # 1 and  # 2 and two - thirds of those from mask  # 3 it was easy to pick out the correct @xmath76 value from the choices provided by spec1d . on rare occasions ,",
    "none of the 10  choices was accurate but it was obvious from the 1d spectrum what the correct @xmath76 was .",
    "the redshift was marked _",
    "manually _ in these cases .",
    "it was typically based on the caii triplet , often a subset of the three  lines ( the reddest line lies amidst a cluster of night sky lines and is sometimes affected by them ) , the @xmath51 tio band ( for red stars ) , and/or the nai doublet ( dwarf stars ) . only 19 out of the 248  science targets , or 17 out of the 221  unique m31 rgb candidates ( 8% ) , are in this `` @xmath76-by - hand '' category .    following the classification scheme used in the deep2 survey @xcite , each science target",
    "was assigned a quality code @xmath27 to indicate the reliability of the measured redshift and the overall quality of its spectrum .",
    "the above cases with well - measured @xmath76 s , including the `` @xmath76-by - hand '' cases , were placed in one of two  categories : ( i )  @xmath78 for redshifts based on two or more robust spectral features ; and ( ii )  @xmath79 for those based on one  robust feature and one or more marginal ones or on a few marginal features .",
    "the @xmath78 @xmath76 measurements are expected to be `` rock solid '' with something like 99% confidence , whereas the @xmath79 @xmath76 s are expected to have @xmath80 reliability .",

    "( ii )  @xmath82 for slitlets with a barely visible spectral continuum and/or very low  s / n ; and ( iii )  @xmath83 for cases where the s / n is marginal to adequate but there is not enough information for reliable @xmath76 determination . judging from the deep2 survey ,",
    "some of our @xmath83 cases are probably distant red galaxies for which the limited spectral coverage and low  s / n prevent us from making a reliable redshift measurement .",
    "the low  s / n in some of the @xmath82 cases in our sample , especially the handful of bright ones [ fig .  [ fig : cmd](_c _ ) ] , could be the result of early mask design / fabrication problems .",
    "such instrumental failures rightfully belong in the @xmath81 category , but we have not attempted to reclassify any @xmath82 cases as there is no direct way to confirm this hypothesis .    a heliocentric correction is applied to each of the three  masks using the iraf task rvcor .",
    "the observation dates span a wide range and the corrections span a range as well : @xmath84  km  s@xmath2 ( mask  # 1 ) , @xmath85  km  s@xmath2 ( mask  # 2 ) , and @xmath86  km  s@xmath2 ( mask  # 3 ) .      in this section",
    "we assess the efficiency of our spectroscopic survey and success rate of the photometric target selection procedure  i.e . ,  the yield of m31 rgb stars .",
    "we do this by counting up the numbers of objects from all three  masks in the different redshift quality ( @xmath27 ) code categories .    starting with the failed @xmath76 measurements , the number of @xmath87 cases is 8/22/14 , 6/19/14 , and 2/0/22 for masks  # 1 , # 2 , and # 3 , respectively ( table  [ tab : masks ] ) .",
    "most of the 16  catastrophic failures ( @xmath81 ) are near the ends of the masks and there are as many as 7  duplicates among them ; this high duplicate fraction ( nearly 50% ) is attributable to the fact that the overlap between masks occurs only near their ends ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fld_loc ] ) .    the fraction of catastrophic failures is lower for the fall 2003 mask  # 3 than for the fall 2002 masks  # 1 and # 2 , and the fraction of spectroscopic successes higher .",
    "there are a few reasons for this .",
    "the fall 2002 mask designs were based on a preliminary optical model for the spectrograph in dsimulator : design imperfections resulted in some slitlets on masks  # 1 and # 2 being affected by vignetting and inter - ccd gaps .",
    "the deimos optical model was refined in time for the fall 2003 mask designs .",
    "the procedure for taking proper calibration data to achieve good wavelength calibration and flat - fielding was fine - tuned over the course of a few months by the deep2 and deimos teams , so the calibration is less than ideal for the two  early masks .",
    "the fall 2002 wavelength setting was not optimal in that there was a finite chance of one of the three caii triplet lines landing in the inter - ccd gap ; the wavelength setting was improved for the fall 2003 observations . finally , the observing conditions were slightly sub par for the two  early masks with occasional thin cirrus and/or worse - than - average seeing .",
    "it is noteworthy that there is no significant difference in success rate between masks  # 1 and # 2 even though the integration time is 50% longer for the latter .",
    "this suggests that factors other than total exposure time ( e.g. ,  such as the factors listed above ) are responsible for determining the final data quality and success rate for the two  early masks .",
    "there are 9  catastrophic failures ( @xmath81 ) among the 221  unique rgb candidates targeted on the three  masks . while these failures lower the overall efficiency of our survey , it is important to keep in mind that they are _ instrumental _ failures that reflect in no way on the physical properties of the targeted objects or on the success rate of the photometric screening procedure  i.e .",

    "the efficiency and success rate for the rest of our deimos survey are expected to be higher than the fractions quoted here : most of the remaining slitmasks ( i.e. ,  those not presented in this paper ) were observed in fall 2003 and should therefore be comparable to mask  # 3 .",
    "it is instructive to examine the foreground / background contamination rates in the present study in the context of the earlier rg02 survey .",
    "the surface density of m31 stars at the @xmath90  kpc location of our field  ` a3 ' ( including the contribution of the giant southern stream ) should be roughly similar to that in rg02 s @xmath91  kpc minor - axis field ; the surface density of foreground galactic stars and background field galaxies is also expected to be the same in the two  fields .",
    "milky way dwarf stars constituted an estimated 57% of rg02 s sample of 80  stars , whereas they represent only 16 out of the 84  stars ( 19% ) in the present study , or 6 out of 62  stars ( 10% ) if one excludes the `` filler '' targets ( lists  3 and  4 ) for which the @xmath19 criterion was relaxed or dropped .",
    "the suppression of foreground contaminants in our study is attributable to @xmath0-based pre - selection of spectroscopic targets (  [ sec : targ_sel ] ) .",

    "the efficiency with which the morphological criteria chi / sharp reject compact galaxies is very sensitive to the seeing and depth of the kpno / mosaic image ; there is a fair bit of variation in seeing / depth across the different fields in the @xcite survey .",

    "three  features of the distribution are worthy of note : ( i )  a strong and narrow peak that dominates each of the four  histograms and presumably corresponds to m31 s giant southern stream ; ( ii )  a low - level broad component that is shifted towards less negative velocities than the main peak ( @xmath98  km  s@xmath2 ) ; and ( iii )  a weak concentration of stars seen as a disjoint group in the range @xmath99  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "a two - gaussian maximum likelihood fit to the first two  components is shown as a thin solid line in panel  ( _ d _ ) .",
    "we will show below that the second  component represents m31 s general halo population (  [ sec : halo_dyn ] ) while the third consists of galactic dwarf stars along the line of sight , but well in front of m31 of course (  [ sec : reject ] ) .",
    "mask  # 3 has the highest success rate of the three  masks for reasons discussed in  [ sec : success ] : their velocity histograms contain 26 , 27 , and 39  stars , respectively , even though the number of spectroscopic targets on the three  masks is comparable .",
    "the foreground dwarf star fraction is highest in the mask  # 3 velocity histogram because the @xmath19 criterion was dropped entirely while selecting lists  3 and  4 `` filler '' spectroscopic targets ( see  [ sec : dsim ] ) .",
    "the two - gaussian fit indicates that the ratio of giant southern stream to general halo stars is about 45:23i.e . ,  that the stream comprises @xmath100 ( 90% confidence limits from the maximum likelihood analysis ) of the m31 population in field  ` a3 ' .",
    "the actual ratio of stream to general halo stars may be somewhat higher than this : the @xmath101 limiting magnitude , and possibly the @xmath0 criterion , used in the spectroscopic target selection process tends to bias the sample against the most metal - rich rgb stars and these stars constitute a larger fraction of the stream than the general halo population (  [ sec : feh ] ) .",
    "it is important to note that we can only distinguish between stream and general halo stars on a statistical basis .",
    "the radial velocity range over which the stream dominates , @xmath102  km  s@xmath2 , contains 47  stars of which 45 are estimated to be members of the stream while the remaining two are members of the halo .",
    "the 21  m31 rgb stars outside this velocity range are all likely to be members of the halo",
    ".    the surface density of the stream appears to be roughly constant along its length over a wide range ( see star count map in * ? ? ?",
    "since the halo density falls monotonically with increasing distance from the galaxy center , the contrast of the stream is expected to become progressively stronger .",
    "this is evident from the velocity histograms presented in the @xcite study ( compare fields  1 , 2 , 6 , and  8 in their fig .",
    "1 ) ; in fact , the contrast in their innermost field ( field  8) is so low that the stream is not readily discernible as a distinct population .",
    "it should be noted that the @xcite fields were chosen to run along the highest surface density part of stream whereas our field  ` a3 ' sample is drawn from the edge of the stream ( by chance ) , so the stream - to - general halo ratio in their fields should be slightly higher than in ours at the same radial distance from m31 .",
    "this section discusses foreground milky way dwarf star contaminants in our sample .",
    "galaxies with high quality spectra ( @xmath79 or  4 ) are easily identified on the basis of redshift and spectral characteristics and removed from the sample , but it is a little more difficult to screen out foreground dwarf stars .",
    "five  pieces of information can be used to distinguish m31 rgb stars from foreground galactic dwarfs : ( i )  radial velocity , ( ii )  location within the ( @xmath103 ) cmd , ( iii )  @xmath19 parameter derived from the ( @xmath20 ) versus ( @xmath21 ) two - color diagram , ( iv )  strength of the @xmath104 nai doublet in red ( cool ) stars , and ( v )  comparison of photometric versus spectroscopic metallicity estimates . in general , no single criterion of the five is by itself a perfect discriminant between rgb and dwarf stars , but the combination is very effective .",

    "however , while candidate m31 rgb stars have a higher mean / median @xmath19 value than candidate galactic dwarfs ( consistent with their designations ) , the distributions are broad and overlap each other so that there is not a clear separation between the two  populations .      @xcite first developed the use of the @xmath110 nai absorption line doublet as a surface - gravity indicator .",
    "more recently @xcite have shown that the nai doublet is expected to be strong in dwarf stars cooler than @xmath111k , which corresponds to @xmath112 according to the calibration relation of @xcite , while rgb stars and hotter dwarfs are expected to have weak lines .",

    "their radial velocities , @xmath153 , @xmath154 , and @xmath155  km  s@xmath2 , place them right among the foreground galactic dwarf population , but it is possible that they belong to the m31 halo instead : for example , they would be within @xmath156 of a broad distribution centered on m31 s systemic velocity of @xmath107  km  s@xmath2 . including all three as members of the m31 halo changes the best - fit width to @xmath157  km  s@xmath2 , while including only the last pair of stars as halo members ( probably more realistic ) changes the width to @xmath158  km  s@xmath2 , where the quoted uncertainties are 90% confidence limits derived from new maximum likelihood fits in each case .",
    "our basic conclusion about the field  ` a3 ' halo sample having an unusually narrow velocity distribution seems to be independent of whether or not the possible rgb interlopers are included in the sample .",
    "the centroid of the radial velocity distribution of the halo population is offset by @xmath159  km  s@xmath2 with respect to m31 s systemic velocity of @xmath107  km  s@xmath2 , and the offset is significant at the 90% confidence level , based on the maximum likelihood fit to the primary sample of 68  m31 rgb stars ( possible interlopers excluded ) .",
    "inclusion of the possible interlopers leads to a small shift in the best - fit halo mean velocity towards less negative values and a reduction therefore in the magnitude of the offset relative to systemic , along with a slight increase in the uncertainty : the net result of these changes is the best - fit offset of @xmath160  km  s@xmath2 is no longer statistically significant .",
    "if the observed offset is real / significant , it could be a second sign of substructure in m31 s halo .",

    "an alternative explanation of the observed velocity offset ( taken at face value ) is that it is a result of global rotation of m31 s halo .",
    "the sense of halo rotation would then be the same as for m31 s disk whose southwest half is known to be blueshifted relative to systemic . since our field  ` a3 ' lies close to the minor axis , this would imply that we are seeing only a small component of the full halo rotation speed and would therefore place a lower limit of @xmath161 .",

    "we investigate whether our rgb star sample is an unbiased sample .",
    "a couple of selection effects in particular are worth discussing .",
    "it is well known that metal - line blanketing causes the rgb tip gets fainter with increasing metallicity .",
    "this causes the most metal - rich of the luminous rgb stars , those with @xmath117\\gtrsim-1 $ ] , to be underrepresented in any magnitude - limited sample .",
    "rg02 characterized this bias in detail and corrected for it .",
    "we do not correct for the bias in this paper since we are primarily interested in a differential stream versus general halo comparison rather than the absolute shape of the [ fe / h ] distribution .",
    "moreover , the bias should be less pronounced in our field  ` a3 ' sample ( and the rest of the deimos survey ) than in rg02 s sample : they used a limiting @xmath12-band magnitude of  22.0 , whereas our study used  22.0 for list  1 primary targets but relaxed it to  22.5 for lists  24 secondary and `` filler '' targets (  [ sec : dsim ] ) .",
    "since metallicity is the second parameter ( after surface gravity ) in determining the strength of the mgb / mgh feature , our @xmath0-based spectroscopic target selection procedure is expected to introduce a bias against the most metal - rich rgb stars (  [ sec : ddo51 ] ) .",
    "we investigate this by plotting @xmath117_{phot}$ ] versus @xmath19 in figure  [ fig : gprob_feh ] .",

    "the metallicity distribution of rgb stars in m31 s giant southern stream is compared to that of its general halo in figure  [ fig : feh ] .",
    "the top panel shows radial velocity as a function of metallicity for 68  confirmed rgb stars .",
    "the portion below the dashed horizontal line is the velocity range occupied by the stream , @xmath102  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "it appears that the 47  stars in this range are more skewed towards high metallicities than the 21  stars outside it .",
    "the thin solid histogram in the lower panel is the @xmath117_{phot}$ ] distribution of stars in the stream s velocity range , while the dashed histogram represents the non - stream general halo population",
    ". we will show below that the stream contains a few stars brighter than the rgb tip ; @xmath117_{phot}$ ] estimates for such stars are unreliable because they are based on a naive linear upward extrapolation of the rgb fiducials (  [ sec : feh_phot_method ] ) .",
    "we therefore recompute the stream s metallicity distribution , this time excluding the seven  stars that lie above the tips of the model rgb tracks ( bold solid histogram ) .",
    "the stream appears to be more metal - rich on average than the general halo , @xmath5\\rangle=-0.51 $ ] versus @xmath6 , and appears to have a smaller metallicity spread , 0.25 versus 0.40  dex .",
    "a two - sided kolmogorov - smirnov test indicates that there is only a 5% probability that the two  [ fe / h ] distributions are drawn from the same parent distribution  in other words , the apparent difference between the stream and general halo metallicity distributions is a @xmath168 effect .",
    "another difference between stream and general halo populations is evident from the cmd [ fig .",
    "[ fig : cmd](_d _ ) ] : there are nine  m31 stars that lie near or above the rgb tip and all nine are in the stream s radial velocity range ( pentagons ) .",
    "a couple of these stars in particular are more than 0.5  mag above m31 s rgb tip and yet must be m31 members given their large negative radial velocities . these are best explained in terms of an intermediate - age asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) population in the stream .",
    "two  pieces of information suggest that the _ true _ mean metallicity of the stream may be even higher , and the difference in mean metallicity between the stream and general halo larger / more significant , than observed .",
    "first , if a sizeable fraction of the rgb stars in the stream are indeed of intermediate age , then their photometric [ fe / h ] estimates will need to be corrected upward by about @xmath166  dex .",
    "second , any bias resulting from our photometric selection procedure will tend to deplete / truncate the high end of the [ fe / h ] distribution (  [ sec : feh_bias ] ) , the end where the difference between the stream and general halo distributions appears to be the greatest .",
    "even if the observed mean metallicity of the stream is taken at face value , it points to a relatively high luminosity for the progenitor satellite galaxy of the stream .",
    "an empirical correlation between metallicity and luminosity has been noted for dwarf satellite galaxies in the local group @xcite which would indicate an absolute @xmath169-band magnitude of @xmath170 for the stream s progenitor , or a luminosity of @xmath171 . this is consistent with the lower limits on progenitor luminosity derived from the stream s width and internal velocity dispersion in paper  ii .",
    "the mean [ fe / h ] of @xmath172  dex observed for the general halo population in field  ` a3 ' , and its total range of 1.5  dex , are broadly consistent with published studies of the metallicity distribution in other fields around the m31 halo @xcite .",
    "however several factors make it difficult for us to carry out detailed comparisons or to draw firm conclusions about real metallicity variations from field to field .",
    "first , our field  ` a3 ' general halo [ fe / h ] distribution is based on only 21  rgb stars and therefore suffers from large poisson fluctuations .",
    "second , while our study like these others is based on photometry of rgb stars , there are significant differences in terms of data analysis techniques and associated systematic errors , sample definition , contamination issues , and selection biases",
    ". the rg02 study may be comparable to ours since both are based on spectroscopy of rgb stars .",
    "we note that rg02 found the halo to be significantly more metal poor , by @xmath173  dex in the mean , with a tail in the [ fe / h ] distribution extending down to @xmath174  dex that is simply not seen in the present study [ see their fig .",
    "17(_c _ ) ] .",
    "this may be yet another sign of substructure in m31 s halo , something that needs to be confirmed using larger , more uniformly selected , and directly comparable samples .",
    "the discussion of the chemical abundance distribution in m31 s halo has so far been based purely on photometric metallicity estimates . in this section",
    "we present a brief analysis of the caii line strength in the spectra of rgb stars .",
    "the ew(ca ) measurement has a relatively large uncertainty associated with it , compared to the random error in @xmath117_{phot}$ ] say , so we prefer not to translate it into an estimate of the spectroscopic metallicity @xmath117_{spec}$ ] . instead the caii line strength is used as a point of comparison between photometric and spectroscopic metallicity estimates .",
    "we demonstrate that the two are in good agreement .",
    "the photometric properties of each star are used to predict the strength of its caii triplet .",

    "other features , such as the caii triplet and occasionally the nai doublet , are also visible .",
    "it should be noted however that the 1d spectra shown in figure  [ fig : spec_indiv ] represent the best third of our sample .",
    "unfortunately the spectral s / n ratio is not high enough to support a detailed star - by - star abundance analysis of all rgb stars in our sample .    we have decided therefore to coadd the 92  spectra ( including 8  duplicate observations ) in groups of about a dozen to improve the s / n .",
    "the spectra are grouped according to the expected caii triplet absorption line strengths of the stars , @xmath182 .",
    "two  different grouping schemes are tried . in the first scheme",
    ", no distinction is made between stream versus general halo populations and the entire set of rgb stars are simply divided into five  bins by line strength . in the second scheme ,",

    "the 16  galactic dwarf stars are placed in a bin by themselves .",
    "all spectra are shifted to zero velocity ( rest frame ) and then combined with inverse - variance weighting .",
    "the resulting coadded spectra are then smoothed with a weighted boxcar of width 5  pixels ( @xmath185 ) , comparable to the instrumental resolution .",
    "figure  [ fig : spec_coadd ] shows the six  coadded spectra using the first grouping scheme .",
    "the lowest coadded spectrum is that of milky way dwarfs and the next five are m31 rgb star coadded spectra with predicted line strength increasing upwards .",

    "it is merely used to illustrate / identify usable absorption features in the far red region of the spectrum  e.g .",
    ",  ca , fe , mg , ti , and v lines for rgb stars , and these plus the surface - gravity - sensitive nai doublet for dwarfs .",
    "a detailed quantitative treatment of absorption lines is postponed until a future paper ; only the caii line strengths are discussed briefly below .",
    "we have therefore not made any attempt to fine tune the match between model and data in terms of line strength or spectral resolution .",
    "the ews of the caii lines are measured in all coadded spectra using an 18 - window for each line . the continuum level ( close to unity , since these are normalized spectra )",
    "is measured on either side of each caii line using windows of the same width while avoiding regions of the spectrum known to contain other strong lines ( see rgb model spectrum in fig .",

    "figure  [ fig : ca_pred_meas ] compares the measured versus predicted combined caii ews for the seven  coadded spectra from the second grouping scheme defined above .",
    "it is reassuring to see that the m31 rgb coadds , both stream and general halo stars ( pentagons and squares , respectively ) , lie close to the one - to - one line .",
    "there is a slight mismatch for the most strong - lined ( metal - rich ) stream rgb stars . if these happen to be intermediate - age stars ",
    "in the @xmath1896  gyr range instead of the 12.6  gyr age that is assumed in fitting model rgb fiducials  their photometric metallicity estimates would be biased low by @xmath190  dex (  [ sec : feh_phot_method ] ) . thus the @xmath182 values would be biased low by 0.7(eq .",
    "[ [ eqn : sigma_ca_pred ] ] ) and would , for the most part , explain the observed offset from the one - to - one line .",

    "it is evident from figure  [ fig : spec_coadd ] that the coadded dwarf star spectrum is significantly less noisy than the m31 rgb star coadds : this is because the former are @xmath196  mag brighter on average [ compare panels  ( _ c _ ) and ( _ d _ ) of fig .",

    "<S> this paper presents the first results from a large spectroscopic survey of red giant branch ( rgb ) stars in m31 using deimos on the keck 10-meter telescope . </S>",
    "<S> a photometric pre - screening method , based on the intermediate - width @xmath0 band centered on the mgb / mgh absorption feature , was used to select spectroscopic targets . </S>",
    "<S> rgb candidates were targeted in a small section of m31 s giant southern tidal stream at a projected distance of 31  kpc from the galaxy s center . </S>",
    "<S> we isolate a clean sample of 68  rgb stars by removing contaminants ( foreground milky way dwarf stars and background galaxies ) using a combination of spectroscopic , imaging , and photometric methods ; the surface - gravity - sensitive nai doublet is particularly useful in this regard . about 65% of the m31 stars </S>",
    "<S> are found to be members of the giant southern stream while the rest appear to be members of the general halo population . </S>",
    "<S> the mean ( heliocentric ) radial velocity of the stream in our field is @xmath1  km  s@xmath2 , blueshifted by @xmath3  km  s@xmath2 relative to m31 s systemic velocity , in good agreement with recent velocity measurements at other points along the stream . </S>",
    "<S> the intrinsic velocity dispersion of the stream is found to be @xmath4  km  s@xmath2 ( 90% confidence limits ) . </S>",
    "<S> a companion paper by @xcite discusses possible orbits , implications of the coldness of the stream , and properties of the progenitor satellite galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the kinematics , and possibly the metallicity distribution , of the general halo ( i.e. ,  non - stream ) population in this region of m31 indicate that it is significantly different from samples drawn from other parts of the m31 halo ; this is probably an indication of substructure in the halo . </S>",
    "<S> the stream appears to have a higher mean metallicity than the general halo : @xmath5\\rangle\\sim-0.54 $ ] versus @xmath6 , and a smaller metallicity spread . </S>",
    "<S> the relatively high metallicity of the stream implies that its progenitor must have been a luminous dwarf galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the caii triplet line strengths of the m31 rgb stars are generally consistent with photometric estimates of their metallicity ( derived by fitting rgb fiducials in the color - magnitude diagram ) . </S>",
    "<S> there is indirect evidence of a population of intermediate - age stars in the stream . </S>"
