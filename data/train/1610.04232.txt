    "low - mass galaxies @xmath1 have shallow gravitational potentials that make them especially sensitive to stellar feedback - driven gas outflows .",

    "isolated low - mass galaxies are thus ideal laboratories for studying the interplay between stellar feedback , gas outflows , and the distribution and dynamics of stars and dark matter .",
    "one of the most widely used techniques for studying galaxies mass distributions is jeans dynamical modeling @xcite .",
    "jeans modeling aims to extract information about a galaxy s underlying gravitational potential from the distribution and kinematics of luminous tracers , which often constitute only a small fraction of the total dynamical mass .",
    "jeans modeling is predicated on the assumption of dynamical equilibrium ( that this , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the gravitational potential ) , so that stellar orbits can be assumed to instantaneously trace the gravitational potential .",
    "jeans modeling traditionally is used to study galaxies with dispersion - supported stellar kinematics and little or no gas , while dynamical modeling of gas - rich galaxies generally is based on measurements of gas rotation velocity .",
    "however , there are several potential advantages to using stellar rather than gas kinematics to probe a galaxy s gravitational potential .",
    "first , many gas - rich galaxies with high specific star formation rates ( ssfr@xmath4sfr@xmath5 ) have irregular gas distributions and lack coherent disks , making accurate measurements of the gas rotation velocity infeasible , particularly in the central regions @xcite . in addition",
    ", turbulence can drive gas velocities in the interstellar medium , even where there is a well - defined net rotation speed @xcite . in this case , the observed gas rotation speed is not an accurate tracer of the circular velocity ( @xmath6 ) , so rotation curve fitting will systematically underestimate the total enclosed mass .",
    "stars are ( effectively ) collisionless tracers of the gravitational potential , so their orbits are not directly coupled to the feedback processes that produce non - gravitational support in the gas .",
    "it is therefore promising ( though observationally challenging ) to probe the mass distributions of gas - rich galaxies with stellar kinematics , which serve as an independent tracer of the gravitational potential @xcite .    among the largest sources of uncertainty in stellar jeans modeling",
    "is poor knowledge of the stellar velocity anisotropy , @xmath7 , which characterizes the relative `` pressure '' between the radial and tangential components of stellar orbits .",
    "direct measurement of @xmath7 requires full 3d velocity information . because observational studies can readily measure only a single line - of - sight velocity component ,",
    "few observational constraints on @xmath7 exist . rather than measuring @xmath7 directly , through proper motions ,",
    "most studies of nearby galaxies attempt to indirectly constrain @xmath7 using dynamical models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . usually , the observed stellar velocities dispersion profile is compared to the dispersion profile predicted by the jeans equations for a particular guess of @xmath8 and @xmath9 profiles .",
    "one then chooses the combination of @xmath8 and @xmath9 profiles that most accurately recover the observed dispersion profile .",
    "observational works typically assume a parameterized form for the gravitational potential ( for example , an nfw profile ) and either assume @xmath10 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or assume a theoretically motivated functional form for @xmath8 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . a variety of qualitatively different forms of @xmath8 are regularly used in the observational literature to model the anisotropies of the same galaxies .",
    "it is generally taken for granted that the anisotropy and dynamical mass profiles that predict the dispersion profile in closest agreement with the observed dispersion profile reflect the galaxy s true @xmath8 and @xmath9 profiles , but the validity of this assumption has not been investigated in detail .    another major uncertainty in jeans modeling concerns the assumption of dynamical equilibrium .",
    "* hereafter e16 ) showed that the stellar kinematics of star - forming gas - rich dwarf galaxies can fluctuate on short @xmath11 timescales , as stellar feedback - driven gas outflows and inflows produce a time - varying gravitational potential that transfers energy to stars and dark matter .",
    "such galaxies are rarely in dynamical equilibrium .",
    "one might worry , then , that any dynamical model that treats galaxies as virialized , equilibrium systems could produce biased or incorrect mass estimates for bursty , gas - rich galaxies .    in this work ,",
    "we explore the role of stellar feedback in driving stellar kinematics in low - mass galaxies , emphasizing observable relations that can test the role of star formation and feedback in driving stellar kinematics .",
    "we then explicitly test the reliability of jeans dynamical models in low - mass galaxies .",
    "we use high - resolution baryonic simulations from the feedback in realistic environments ( fire ) project .",
    "because both the underlying mass distribution and 3d kinematics of simulated galaxies can be measured exactly , simulations make it possible to measure how robustly dynamical models can recover a galaxy s true mass and anisotropy profile and how non - equilibrium fluctuations can bias mass estimates derived from jeans modeling .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : simulations ] , we describe the fire simulations and our galaxy sample . in section  [ sec : presenting_profiles ] , we present velocity anisotropy and dispersion profiles for our simulated galaxies .",
    "in section  [ sec : observational_prediction ] , we study the relationship between stellar kinematics and star formation rate , making the observable prediction that at fixed stellar mass , galaxies with higher ssfr should have systemically higher stellar velocity dispersion . in section",
    "[ sec : spherical_jeans_modeling ] , we construct spherical jeans models for our galaxies , considering both the case in which @xmath8 is modeled with an unknown parameter and the case in which it can be measured directly . in section  [ sec : dwarf_spheroidal ] , we compare the reliability of jeans models in gas - rich galaxies to their reliability in gas - poor , quiescent galaxies . finally , in section  [ sec : summary_discussion ] , we summarize our results and discuss avenues for future research .",
    "we use cosmological zoom - in baryonic simulations from the feedback in realistic environments ( fire ) project @xcite .",
    "the galaxies which comprise our sample were first presented in @xcite and @xcite and were also studied in .",
    "we briefly summarize the simulations here , directing the reader to previous works for more details .",
    "our simulations were run using the gizmo code @xcite , which employs pressure - entropy based smooth particle hydrodynamics ( p - sph ; * ? ? ? * ) and an improved version of the treepm gravity solver from gadget-3 @xcite .",
    "initial conditions were generated at @xmath12 using the music code @xcite .",
    "all simulations use a flat @xmath13cdm cosmology with @xmath14 .",
    "gizmo incorporates radiative cooling and heating rates for gas from cloudy @xcite across @xmath15 , with atomic , molecular , and metal - line cooling computed for 11 elements . ionization and heating rates include a redshift - dependent , spatially uniform ultraviolet background computed in @xcite .",
    "star formation occurs only in dense , locally self - gravitating molecular clouds with density @xmath16 and proceeds with an instantaneous efficiency of 100% per free - fall time ( though stellar feedback quickly regulates the local gas density , leading to much lower resultant efficiency ; see orr et al .",
    ", in prep . , for more details ) .",
    "each star particle represents a single stellar population with the same mass and metallicity as its progenitor gas particle and a @xcite initial mass function .",
    "once stars form , they begin to deposit energy , momentum , and metals into nearby gas particles through a variety of feedback processes .",
    "energy , momentum , mass , and metal returns are calculated directly from stellar evolution models at each timestep , as computed from starburst99 ( v7.0 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we include the effects of stellar winds , radiation pressure from massive stars , local photoionization and photoelectric heating , and core - collapse and type ia supernovae , as detailed in @xcite .       throughout our primary analysis ,",
    "we use linearly spaced measurements of @xmath18 between @xmath19 and @xmath20 as our inputs in jeans modeling .",
    "many observational works can not reliably measure @xmath21 out to large radius . as discussed in the previous section",
    ", the region in which @xmath21 is sampled can have nontrivial effects on the predicted mass profile .",
    "for example , using logarithmically spaced measurements of @xmath18 or sampling @xmath18 primarily at small radius will cause the jeans modeling procedure to prioritize recovery of the @xmath18 profile at small radius over large radius , potentially leading to less accurate constraints on the total mass .    to assess the effects of varying the sampling of @xmath18 measurements to which our jeans models are fit , we experimented with using logarithmic bins and with bins extending only out to @xmath22 , the radius enclosing 50% of the stellar mass , rather than @xmath23 .",
    "table  [ tab : bin_spacing ] presents the median fractional mass errors over the last 40 snapshots of ` m10 ` and ` m10.6 ` for each of these binning schemes .",
    "mass errors are smallest for linearly spaced bins extending out to @xmath23 .",
    "using logarithmic bins out @xmath23 produces slightly larger mass errors , while restricting the fit to @xmath18 measurements inside @xmath24 leads to significantly larger mass errors .",
    "this is not surprising : when the available @xmath18 data is all within @xmath24 , jeans modeling can not constrain the mass profile between @xmath24 and @xmath23 . extrapolations in @xmath9 to larger radius are then based entirely on the form of the mass profile at small radius .",
    "we stress that , once a fitting region and binning scheme are chosen , our results are well converged with bin size : increasing the number of linearly spaced bins between @xmath19 and @xmath20 by a factor of two causes sub percent - level changes in the predicted dynamical masses .",
    "thus far , we have limited our discussion to the simplified case in which the true form of @xmath8 is known a priori .",
    "this is valid for systems for which one can obtain 3d stellar kinematics via proper motions ( see section  [ sec : observations ] ) .",
    "however , measuring @xmath7 directly in nearby low - mass galaxies is not yet feasible , so one generally uses a parameterized model for @xmath8 . here",
    ", we show how each of our three parameterized models for @xmath8 affects our jeans model fit for the total density profile .    during @xmath25 minimization ,",
    "we simultaneously fit for @xmath26 and the free parameter characterizing the anisotropy profile ",
    "@xmath27 for constant anisotropy , and the anisotropy radius , @xmath28 , for the ml and om profiles .",
    "we carry out @xmath25 minimization as described in section  [ sec : chi_square_minization ] , with the additional free parameter from the anisotropy increasing the dimension of the parameter space from 2 to 3 .",
    "figure  [ fig : beta_model_chi2s ] shows @xmath25 values for fixed-@xmath29 slices of parameter space for each of the models for @xmath8 that we tested in section  [ sec : different_beta_models ] . in each panel , @xmath29 is set to the value corresponding to the global @xmath25 minimum .",
    "to allow for straightforward comparison between the dynamical masses predicted by the different models for @xmath8 , which all favor different values of @xmath29 , we plot total dynamical masses rather than @xmath30 on the y - axis . at fixed @xmath29 ,",
    "these relate to @xmath30 via a multiplicative constant ( see equation  [ eqn : burkert_mr ] ) .",
    "all three forms of @xmath8 show some degeneracy between mass and anisotropy : models with radial orbits ( high @xmath7 ) and low @xmath31 predict similar @xmath18 profiles and @xmath25 values to those with more tangential orbits ( low @xmath7 ) and high @xmath31 .",
    "values for these profiles produce lower overall @xmath7 values , because @xmath28 is approximately the radius at which the profile increases from @xmath32 to @xmath33 ( for the ml profile ) or @xmath34 ( for the om profile ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : om_vs_ml_mean_beta ] shows this explicitly .",
    "] this degeneracy is well - studied in the literature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and breaking it is among the primary incentives for measuring @xmath8 through resolved proper motions studies . in part because of this degeneracy , the @xmath25 minimum does not coincide with the true @xmath31 and the best - fit anisotropy values recovered by direct fitting , which figure  [ fig : beta_model_chi2s ] shows in red symbols .",
    "however , the mass - anisotropy degeneracy is manifest differently for different models of @xmath8 , as the three models differently shaped @xmath25 contours show .",
    "the largest error in @xmath31 occurs for the constant anisotropy model . here , jeans modeling converges on a combination of high @xmath31 and low @xmath7 , which produces a similar @xmath18 profile to the true combination of lower @xmath31 and higher @xmath7 .",
    "the different constraints on @xmath8 that different anisotropy profiles provide was highlighted by @xcite , who used a dynamical modeling framework similar to ours to investigate how accurately jeans modeling could recover the anisotropy profiles of dark matter halos from dissipationless cosmological simulations .",
    "they tried a variety of different models for @xmath8 , including constant anisotropy and the ml profile .",
    "as in our simulations , the true anisotropy profiles of their halos generally increased with radius and were reasonably well - fit by the ml model . despite this , they found that using the ml profile in jeans modeling provided poor constraints on the anisotropy profile : even when the true @xmath8 closely resembled an ml profile , their dynamical modeling procedure could not reliably recover the true @xmath8 and was unable to distinguish between models with different anisotropy radii @xmath28 .",
    "in figure  [ fig : beta_model_chi2s ] , the shape of the contours of the @xmath25 function in @xmath36 parameter space illustrates the poor constraints on @xmath28 . for the ml profile ( and , to a lesser extent , the om profile ) , @xmath25 minimization is unlikely to strongly constrain @xmath28 , because similar @xmath25 values are produced by a wide range of @xmath28 values ( that is , the @xmath25 contours are almost horizontal ) .",
    "this occurs for two reasons .",
    "first , adjusting @xmath28 in the ml and om profiles changes the total anisotropy less than adjusting @xmath27 in the constant - anisotropy models ; that is , the ml and om profiles have a smaller dynamic range of allowed @xmath7 values .",
    "figure  [ fig : om_vs_ml_mean_beta ] demonstrates this explicitly , by showing the mean anisotropy between @xmath37 and @xmath23 , @xmath38 , of the ml and om anisotropy functions for different values of @xmath28 . while varying @xmath27 for the constant - anisotropy model allows @xmath39 to take on any value in @xmath40 $ ] , varying @xmath28 in the ml and om profiles only allows it to take values in the intervals @xmath41 $ ] and @xmath42 $ ] , respectively .",
    "these profiles have less freedom  and less opportunity for failure  in @xmath8 .",
    "the range of allowed @xmath31 values is thus also smaller .",
    "second , equation  [ eqn : int_factor ] shows that it is the behavior of @xmath8 at small radius that most significantly affects the @xmath18 profile predicted by jeans modeling ; at larger radii , the contribution from @xmath8 falls off as @xmath43 .",
    "both the om and ml profiles force @xmath44 as @xmath45 , so there is less freedom in @xmath7 , especially at small radii . on the other hand ,",
    "the constant anisotropy model allows @xmath46 to vary over the full range of @xmath47 $ ] , and as such , different values of @xmath27 produce @xmath18 profiles that are more distinct from one another than the range of profiles predicted by different choices of @xmath28 in the ml and om models .",
    "the om and ml models thus have less relative predictive power for constraining the shape of the anisotropy profile . on the other hand , in many dynamical modeling studies ,",
    "the dynamical mass profile is of primary interest , and the anisotropy profile is viewed as a nuisance parameter . for such works ,",
    "the ml and om profiles provide somewhat more accurate measurements of @xmath31 than the constant - anisotropy profile , which tends to systemically overestimate the total mass ( see section  [ sec : different_beta_models ] ) ."
