    "a scaling relation between the rate of fidelity loss and the variance is derived and verified numerically .",
    "the maximal variance scales as @xmath28 with the size of the system .",
    "an upper bound on the strength of tolerable noise , i.e. , noise leading to a negligible fidelity loss , is derived for a generic control noise model .",
    "the upper bound decreases linearly with the size of the system @xmath0 . in practice , for state - to - state control tasks the noise will dominate , practically scaling as @xmath2 with the size of the system .",
    "at best , according to the upper bound the scaling is @xmath1 .",
    "we can speculate that for a control task of generating a unitary transformation , which is equivalent to @xmath0 simultaneous state - to - state control tasks , the decrease in fidelity with noise will practically scale as @xmath139 .",
    "the numerical analysis of a model problem associated with the @xmath4 spectrum - generating algebra verifies the scaling relations and in addition suggests a conjecture that the task of finding a control field that requires a large variance , for example obtaining a cat state , is hard . in view of the foregoing discussion",
    "this conjecture essentially connects the computational complexity of the control problem with the sensitivity of the controlled system to noise .",
    "we believe that this relation is broader than the framework of the control paradigm considered in the present work and applies to any coherent control problem .",
    "it seems reasonable to predict that for other control algebras the generalized coherent states ( gcs)@xcite will assume the role of spin coherent states ( sgs ) considered in the present analysis .",
    "for example , in the two - dimensional henon - heils model with local controls @xmath140 and @xmath141 the gcs are products of single mode coherent states @xcite .",
    "control of a gcs to gcs transformation is easy with respect to generating a non - gcs state such as an entangled state @xcite .",
    "it still is to be verified that the noise sensitivity of generating entangled states is large .",
    "we want to thank lorenza viola , tomaso calarco and constatine brief for crucial discussions .",
