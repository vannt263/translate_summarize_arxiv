    "in 2005 , the bes collaboration observed a narrow peak called @xmath0 in the reaction @xmath11 with a statistical significance of @xmath12 , and the mass and width of the @xmath0 obtained from the fit with a breit - wigner function are @xmath13 mev and @xmath14 mev , respectively@xcite .",
    "no partial wave analysis has been made but based on production and decay , it is most likely that the @xmath15 of the @xmath0 is @xmath16 .",
    "the bes collaboration suggests that the @xmath0 is related to the @xmath17 mass threshold enhancement observed in the @xmath18 channel@xcite , which therefore triggering many exotic speculations of the nature of the @xmath0 such as glueball@xcite , @xmath17 baryonium@xcite etc .",
    "it should be noted that there is no strong experimental evidence that the @xmath17 threshold enhancement and the @xmath0 are the same resonance , as pointed out by huang and zhu@xcite ; very probably they have completely different underlying structures . in the presence of the @xmath0 being not related to the @xmath17 mass threshold enhancement , huang and zhu suggested the @xmath0 is the second radial excitation of the @xmath19@xcite , while klempt and zaitsev rather believed the @xmath0 to be the @xmath19 s first radial excitation@xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 was reported by the markiii collaboration in radiative @xmath20 decays into @xmath21@xcite and @xmath22@xcite .",
    "it was also observed by the dm2 collaboration in @xmath20 radiative decays in the @xmath22@xcite decay mode with a mass of @xmath23 mev and a width of @xmath24 mev and in the @xmath21 decay mode@xcite .",
    "vijande et al . suggested that it can be identified as the @xmath25 @xmath10 state@xcite ; page and li proposed that it could have hybrid admixture@xcite . a reanalysis markiii data on @xmath26 performed by bugg et al .",
    "suggested that the decay mode should not be in the @xmath22 pseudoscalar wave but in the @xmath27 @xmath28 scalar wave@xcite .",
    "this was supported by bes collaboration suggesting the @xmath22 resonance at @xmath29 mev should be interpreted as the scalar meson in its @xmath30 decay@xcite .",
    "the conclusions regarding the presence of this pseudoscalar signal in the markiii @xmath31 data become therefore controversial .",
    "more recently , the decay channel @xmath32 was analyzed by the bes collaboration , and a strong enhancement was found in the @xmath21 invariant mass distribution at @xmath33 gev .",
    "the partial wave analysis indicated that the structure was predominantly pseudoscalar with small scalar and tensor contributions .",
    "the mass of the pseudoscalar state also called @xmath1 is @xmath34 mev , the width @xmath35 mev and the product branching fraction is @xmath36@xcite .",
    "the bes collaboration suggested that it could be a mixture of the glueball and the @xmath10 meson .    from pdg2006@xcite , the @xmath37 meson nonet ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath19 and @xmath40 ) as well as the @xmath25 members [ @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 have been well established .",

    "the purpose of this work is to check in the simple picture of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 as the @xmath2 @xmath10 states , whether the total widths of these two states can be reasonably reproduced in the @xmath3 meson decay model or not .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "the brief review of the @xmath3 decay model is given ( for the detailed review see _",

    "the @xmath3 decay model has been widely used to evaluate the strong decays of hadrons@xcite , since it gives a good description of many of the observed decay amplitudes and partial widths of the hadrons .",
    "the main assumption of the @xmath3 decay model is that strong decays take place via the creation of a @xmath3 quark - antiquark pair from the vacuum . the new produced quark - antiquark pair , together with the @xmath10 within the initial meson regroups into two outgoing mesons in all possible quark rearrangement ways , which corresponds to the two decay diagrams as shown in fig.1 for the meson decay process @xmath45 .    the transition operator @xmath46 of the decay @xmath47 in the @xmath3 model is given by @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a dimensionless parameter representing the probability of the quark - antiquark pair @xmath50 with @xmath51 creation from the vacuum , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the momenta of the created quark @xmath54 and antiquark @xmath55 , respectively .",
