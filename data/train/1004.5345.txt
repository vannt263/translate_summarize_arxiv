    "here is a story , told at least in part through the exploits of one of its main characters .",
    "this character , like many a hollywood ( or bollywood ) star , has played a leading role in quite a few compelling tales ; this one ultimately concerns the dynamics of partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms .",
    "we begin with a connected , compact , smooth surface @xmath0 without boundary , of genus at least @xmath1 .",
    "the gauss - bonnet theorem tells us that the average curvature of any riemannian metric on @xmath0 must be negative , equal to @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the euler characteristic of @xmath0 .",
    "we restrict our attention to the metrics on @xmath0 of everywhere negative curvature ; among such metrics , there is a finite - dimensional moduli space of _ hyperbolic _ metrics , which have constant curvature .",
    "up to a normalization of the curvature , each hyperbolic surface may be represented by a quotient @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the complex upper half plane with the metric @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is a discrete subgroup of @xmath8 , isomorphic to the fundamental group of @xmath0 .",
    "more generally , any negatively curved metric on @xmath0 lies in the conformal class of some hyperbolic metric , and the space of all such metrics is path connected . throughout this story ,",
    "@xmath0 will be equipped with a negatively curved metric .",
    "this negatively curved muse first caught the fancy of jacques hadamard in the late 1890 s @xcite . among other things ,",
    "hadamard studied the properties of geodesics on @xmath0 and a flow @xmath9 on the unit tangent bundle to @xmath0 called the _",
    "geodesic flow_. the image of a unit vector @xmath10 under the time-@xmath11 map of this flow is obtained by following the unique unit - speed geodesic @xmath12 satisfying @xmath13 for a distance @xmath11 and taking the tangent vector at that point : @xmath14 this geodesic flow , together with its close relatives , plays the starring role in the story told here .",
    "a theorem of liouville implies that @xmath15 preserves a natural probability measure @xmath16 on @xmath17 , known as _",
    "liouville measure _ , which locally is just the product of normalized area on @xmath0 with lebesgue measure on the circle fibers .",
    "poincar recurrence then implies that almost every orbit of the geodesic flow comes back close to itself infinitely often .    in the special case where @xmath18 is a hyperbolic surface ,",
    "the unit tangent bundle @xmath17 is naturally identified with @xmath19 , and the action of the geodesic flow @xmath15 is realized by left multiplication by the diagonal matrix @xmath20 liouville measure is normalized haar measure .    in his study of @xmath15",
    ", hadamard introduced the notion of the _ stable manifold _",
    "of a vector @xmath21 : @xmath22 the proof that such sets are manifolds is a nontrivial consequence of negative curvature and a noted accomplishment of hadamard s .",
    "indeed , each stable manifold @xmath23 is an injectively immersed , smooth copy of the real line , and taken together , the stable manifolds form a foliation @xmath24 of @xmath25 .",
    "similarly , one defines an _ unstable manifold _ by : @xmath26 and denotes the corresponding unstable foliation @xmath27 .",
    "the foliations @xmath24 and @xmath27 are key supporting players in this story .    in the case",
    "where @xmath28 , the stable manifolds are orbits of the _ positive horocyclic flow _ on @xmath29 defined by left - multiplication by @xmath30 and the unstable manifolds are orbits of the _ negative horocyclic flow _ , defined by left - multiplication by @xmath31 this fact can be deduced from the explicit relations : @xmath32    the stable and unstable foliations stratify the future and past , respectively , of the geodesic flow .",
    "it might come as no surprise that their features dictate the asymptotic behavior of the geodesic flow .",
    "for example , hadamard obtained from the existence of these foliations and poincar recurrence that periodic orbits for @xmath15 are dense in @xmath17 .",
    "some 40 years after hadamard received the prix poncelet for his work on surfaces , eberhard hopf introduced a simple argument that proved the ergodicity ( with respect to liouville measure ) of the geodesic flow on @xmath17 , for any closed negatively curved surface @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "in particular , hopf proved that almost every infinite geodesic in @xmath0 is dense ( and uniformly distributed ) , not only in @xmath0 , but in @xmath17 .",
    "it was another thirty years before hopf s result was extended by anosov to geodesic flows for negatively curved compact manifolds in arbitrary dimension .",
    "up to this point the discussion is quite well - known and classical , and from here the story can take many turns .",
    "for example , for arithmetic hyperbolic surfaces , the distribution of closed orbits of the flow and associated dynamical zeta functions quickly leads us into deep questions in analytic number theory .",
    "another path leads to the study the spectral theory of negatively curved surfaces , inverse problems and quantum unique ergodicity .",
    "the path we shall take here leads to the definition of partial hyperbolicity .",
    "let us fix a unit of time @xmath33 and discretize the system @xmath15 in these units ; that is , we study the dynamics of the time-@xmath34 map @xmath35 of the geodesic flow . from a digital age perspective",
    "this is a natural thing to do ; for example , to plot the orbits of a flow , a computer evaluates the flow at discrete , usually equal , time intervals .",
    "if we carry this computer - based analogy one step further , we discover an interesting question .",
    "namely , a computer does not  evaluate the flow \" precisely , but rather uses an _ approximation to the time-@xmath34 map _",
    "( such as an ode solver or symplectic integrator ) to compute its orbits .",
    "to what extent does iterating this approximation retain the actual dynamical features of the flow @xmath15 , such as ergodicity ?    to formalize this question , we consider a _",
    "@xmath36 such that the @xmath37 distance @xmath38 is small . note that @xmath39 in general will no longer embed in a flow .",
    "while we assume that the distance from @xmath39 to @xmath35 is small , this is no longer the case for the distance from @xmath40 to @xmath41 , when @xmath42 is large .",
    "is not a good approximation to @xmath43 . ]",
    "the earliest description of the dynamics of such a perturbation @xmath39 comes from a type of structural stability theorem proved by hirsch , pugh , and shub  @xcite .",
    "the results there imply in particular that if @xmath38 is sufficiently small , then there exists an @xmath39-invariant _ center foliation _",
    "@xmath44 that is homeomorphic to the orbit foliation @xmath45 of @xmath15 .",
    "the leaves of @xmath46 are smooth . moreover , the homeomorphism @xmath47 sending @xmath46 to @xmath45 is close to the identity and @xmath46 is the unique such foliation .",
    "the rest of this paper is about @xmath39 and , in places , the foliation @xmath48 .",
    "what is known about @xmath39 is now substantial , but far from complete .",
    "for example , the following basic problem is open .",
    "_ problem .",
    "_ determine whether @xmath39 has a dense orbit .",
    "more precisely , does there exist a neighborhood @xmath49 of @xmath35 in the space @xmath50 of @xmath51 diffeomorphisms of @xmath17 ( for some @xmath52 ) such that every @xmath53 is topologically transitive ?",
    "note that @xmath35 is ergodic with respect to volume @xmath16 , and hence is itself topologically transitive . in what follows",
    ", we will explain results from the last 15 years implying that any perturbation of @xmath35 _ that preserves volume _ is ergodic , and hence has a dense orbit . for perturbations",
    "that do not preserve volume , a seminal result of bonatti and daz shows that @xmath35 can be approximated arbitrarily well by @xmath37-open sets of transitive diffeomorphisms @xcite .",
    "but the fundamental question of whether @xmath35 lives in such an open set remains unanswered .    in most of the discussion here , we will work in the conservative setting ,",
    "in which the diffeomorphism @xmath39 preserves a volume probability measure . to fix notation",
    ", @xmath54 will always denote a connected , compact riemannian manifold without boundary , and @xmath16 will denote a probability volume on @xmath54 . for @xmath52 ,",
    "we denote by @xmath55 the space of @xmath51 diffeomorphisms of @xmath54 preserving @xmath16 , equipped with the @xmath51 topology .",
    "the map @xmath35 and its perturbation @xmath39 are concrete examples of partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms .",
    "a diffeomorphism @xmath56 of a compact riemannian manifold @xmath54 is _ partially hyperbolic _ if there exists an integer @xmath57 and a nontrivial , @xmath58-invariant , continuous splitting of the tangent bundle @xmath59 such that , for any @xmath60 and unit vectors @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 : @xmath64 up to a change in the riemannian metric , one can always take @xmath65 in this definition @xcite . in the case where @xmath66 is the trivial bundle , the map @xmath39 is said to be _ anosov . _",
    "the central example @xmath35 is partially hyperbolic : in that case , the bundle @xmath67 is tangent to the orbits of the flow , and @xmath68 and @xmath69 are tangent to the leaves of @xmath24 and @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "partial hyperbolicity is a @xmath37-open condition : any diffeomorphism sufficiently @xmath37-close to a partially hyperbolic diffeomorphism is itself partially hyperbolic .",
    "hence the perturbations of @xmath35 we consider are also partially hyperbolic . for an extensive discussion of examples of partially hyperbolic dynamical systems ,",
    "see the survey articles @xcite and the book @xcite . among these examples",
    "are : the frame flow for a compact manifold of negative sectional curvature and most affine transformations of compact homogeneous spaces .",
    "as is the case with the example @xmath35 , the stable and unstable bundles @xmath68 and @xmath69 of an arbitrary partially hyperbolic diffeomorphism are always tangent to foliations , which we will again denote by @xmath24 and @xmath27 respectively ; this is a consequence of partial hyperbolicity and a generalization of hadamard s argument .",
    "by contrast , the center bundle @xmath66 need not be tangent to a foliation , and can even be nowhere integrable .",
    "in many cases of interest , however , there is also a center foliation @xmath46 tangent to @xmath66 : the content of the hirsch - pugh - shub work in  @xcite is the properties of systems that admit such foliations , known as  normally hyperbolic foliations . \"",
    "there is a natural and slightly less general notion than integrability of @xmath66 that appears frequently in the literature .",
    "we say that a partially hyperbolic diffeomorphism @xmath56 is _ dynamically coherent _ if the subbundles @xmath70 and @xmath71 are tangent to foliations @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively , of @xmath54 . if @xmath39 is dynamically coherent , then the center bundle @xmath66 is also integrable : one obtains the center foliation @xmath46 by intersecting the leaves of @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the examples @xmath35 are dynamically coherent , as are their perturbations ( by @xcite : see @xcite for a discussion ) .",
    "brin and pesin @xcite and independently pugh and shub @xcite first examined the ergodic properties of partially hyperbolic systems in the early 1970 s .",
    "the methods they developed give an ergodicity criterion for partially hyperbolic @xmath74 satisfying the following additional hypotheses :    * the bundle @xmath66 is tangent to a @xmath37 foliation @xmath46 , and * @xmath39 acts isometrically ( or nearly isometrically ) on the leaves of @xmath46 .",
    "in @xcite it is shown that such an @xmath39 is ergodic with respect to @xmath16 if it satisfies a condition called accessibility .",
    "a partially hyperbolic diffeomorphism @xmath75 is _ accessible _ if any point in @xmath54 can be reached from any other along an _",
    "@xmath76-path _ , which is a concatenation of finitely many subpaths , each of which lies entirely in a single leaf of @xmath24 or a single leaf of @xmath77 .",
    "this ergodicity criterion applies to the discretized geodesic flow @xmath35 : its center bundle is tangent to the orbit foliation for @xmath15 , which is smooth , giving ( a ) .",
    "the action of @xmath35 preserves the nonsingular vector field @xmath78 , which implies ( b ) .",
    "it is straightforward to see that if @xmath0 is a hyperbolic surface , then @xmath35 is accessible : the stable and unstable foliations are orbits of the smooth horocyclic flows @xmath79 and @xmath80 , respectively , and matrix multiplication on the level of the lie algebra @xmath81 shows that locally these flows generate all directions in @xmath8 : @xmath82 =   \\left(\\begin{array}{cc } \\frac12 & 0\\\\ 0 & -\\frac12 \\end{array}\\right ) ; \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the matrices appearing on the left are infinitesimal generators of the horocyclic flows , and the matrix on the right generates the geodesic flow . since @xmath35 is accessible , it is ergodic .",
    "now what of a small perturbation of @xmath35 ? as mentioned above , any @xmath83 sufficiently @xmath37 close to @xmath35 also has a center foliation @xmath46 , and the action of @xmath39 on the leaves is nearly isometric . with some work",
    ", one can also show that @xmath39 is accessible ( this was carried out in @xcite ) .",
    "there is one serious reason why the ergodicity criterion of @xcite can not be applied to @xmath39 : the foliation @xmath46 is not @xmath37 .",
    "the leaves of @xmath46 are @xmath37 , and the tangent spaces to the leaves vary continuously , but they do not vary smoothly",
    ". we will explore in later sections the extent to which @xmath46 fails to be smooth , but for now suffice it to say that @xmath46 is pathologically bad , not only from a smooth perspective but also from a measure - theoretic one .    the extent to which @xmath46 is bad was not known at the time , but there was little hope of applying the existing techniques to perturbations of @xmath35 . the first major breakthrough in understanding the ergodicity of perturbations of @xmath35 came in the 1990 s :    let @xmath0 be a hyperbolic surface , and let @xmath15 be the geodesic flow on @xmath17 . then @xmath35 is _ stably ergodic _ : there is a neighborhood @xmath49 of @xmath35 in @xmath84 such that every @xmath85 is ergodic with respect to @xmath16 .    the new technique introduced in @xcite was a dynamical approach to understanding lebesgue density points which they called _",
    "juliennes_. the results in @xcite were soon generalized to the case where @xmath0 has variable negative curvature @xcite and to more general classes of partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms @xcite .",
    "not long after @xcite appeared , pugh and shub had formulated an influential circle of conjectures concerning the ergodicity of partially hyperbolic systems .",
    "[ c = main ] on any compact manifold , ergodicity holds for an open and dense set of @xmath86 volume preserving partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms .",
    "this conjecture can be split into two parts using the concept of accessibility .",
    "[ c = main2 ] accessibility holds for an open and dense subset of @xmath86 partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms , volume preserving or not .",
    "[ c = main3 ] a partially hyperbolic @xmath86 volume preserving diffeomorphism with the essential accessibility property is ergodic .",
    "essential accessibility is a measure - theoretic version of accessibility that is implied by accessibility : @xmath39 is essentially accessible if for any two positive volume sets @xmath87 and @xmath88 , there exists an @xmath76-path in @xmath54 connecting some point in @xmath87 to some point in @xmath88 ",
    "see @xcite for a discussion .    in the next two sections",
    ", i will report on progress to date on these conjectures .    _ further remarks .",
    "volume - preserving anosov diffeomorphisms ( where @xmath89 ) are always ergodic .",
    "this was proved by anosov in his thesis @xcite .",
    "note that anosov diffeomorphisms are also accessible , since in that case the foliations @xmath24 and @xmath27 are transverse . hence all three conjectures hold true for anosov diffeomorphisms .",
    "it is natural to ask whether partial hyperbolicity is a necessary condition for stable ergodicity .",
    "this is true when @xmath54 is @xmath90-dimensional @xcite and also in the space of symplectomorphisms @xcite , but not in general @xcite .",
    "what is true is that the related condition of having a dominated splitting is necessary for stable ergodicity ( see @xcite ) .",
    "3 .   one can also ask whether for partially hyperbolic systems , stable ergodicity implies accessibility . if one works in a sufficiently high smoothness class , then this is not the case , as was shown in the groundbreaking paper of f. rodrguez hertz @xcite , who will also speak at this congress . hertz used methods from kam theory to find an alternate route to stable ergodicity for certain essentially accessible systems .",
    "4 .   on the other hand , it is reasonable to expect that some form of accessibility is a necessary hypothesis for a general stable ergodicity criterion for partially hyperbolic maps ( see the discussion at the beginning of @xcite ) . unlike anosov diffeomorphisms , which are always ergodic ,",
    "partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms need not be ergodic . for example",
    ", the product of an anosov diffeomorphism with the identity map on any manifold is partially hyperbolic , but certainly not ergodic .",
    "see also theorem 11.16 in @xcite .",
    "in general , the stable and unstable foliations of a partially hyperbolic diffeomorphism are not smooth ( though they are not pathological , either  see below ) .",
    "hence it is not possible in general to use infinitesimal techniques to establish accessibility the way we did in equation ( [ e = stabunst ] ) for the discretized hyperbolic geodesic flow .",
    "the @xmath37 topology allows for enough flexibility in perturbations that conjecture  [ c = main2 ] has been completely verified in this context :    [ t = dw ] for any @xmath52 , accessibility holds for a @xmath37 open and dense subset of the partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms in @xmath91 , volume - preserving or not .",
    "theorem  [ t = dw ] also applies inside the space of partially hyperbolic symplectomorphisms .",
    "more recently , the complete version of conjecture  [ c = main3 ] has been verified for systems with @xmath92-dimensional center bundle .",
    "[ t = rhrhu ] for any @xmath52 , accessibility is @xmath37 open and @xmath51 dense among the partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms in @xmath93 with one - dimensional center bundle .",
    "this theorem was proved earlier in a much more restricted context by niic - t \" or \" ok @xcite .",
    "the @xmath37 openness of accesssibility was shown in @xcite . a version of theorem  [ t = rhrhu ] for non - volume preserving diffeomorphisms was later proved in @xcite .",
    "the reason that it is possible to improve theorem  [ t = dw ] from @xmath37 density to @xmath51 density in this context is that the global structure of accessibility classes is well - understood . by _ accessibility class _ we mean an equivalence class with respect to the relation generated by @xmath76-paths . when the dimension of @xmath66 is @xmath92 , accessibility classes are ( @xmath37 immersed ) submanifolds . whether this is always true when @xmath94 is unknown and is an important obstacle to attacking the general case of conjecture  [ c = main2 ] .",

    "more precise criteria for accessibility have been established for special classes of partially hyperbolic systems such as discretized anosov flows , skew products , and low - dimensional systems @xcite .",
    "refined formulations of accessibility have been used to study higher - order statistical properties of certain partially hyperbolic systems , in particular the discretized geodesic flow @xcite . the precise relationship between accessibility and rate of mixing ( in the absence of other hypotheses )",
    "remains a challenging problem to understand .",
    "3 .   accessibility also plays a key role in a recently developed livsi theory for partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms , whose conclusions closely mirror those in the anosov setting @xcite .",
    "conjecture  [ c = main ] has been verified under one additional , reasonably mild hypothesis :    [ t = bw ] let @xmath39 be @xmath86 , volume - preserving , partially hyperbolic and center bunched . if @xmath39 is essentially accessible , then @xmath39 is ergodic , and in fact has the kolmogorov property .",

    "when the center foliation for @xmath39 fails to be absolutely continuous , this means that one can not ",
    "quotient out by the center direction \" to study ergodic properties @xmath39 .",
    "the existence of such pathological center foliations was first demonstrated by a. katok ( whose construction was written up by milnor in @xcite ) .",
    "theorem  [ t = sw ] shows that this type of pathology can occur in open sets of diffeomorphisms and so is inescapable in general . in the next section ,",
    "we discuss the extent to which this pathology is the norm .    _ further remarks . _    1 .   an unpublished letter of ma to shub examines the consequences of nonvanishing lyapunov center exponents on the disintegration of volume along center foliations",
    ". some of the ideas there are pursued in greater depth in @xcite .",
    "the examples of katok in @xcite in fact have center exponents almost everywhere equal to 0 , showing that nonvanishing center exponents is not a necessary condition for atomic disintegration of volume .",
    "systems for which the center leaves are not compact ( or even dynamically compact ) also exhibit non - absolutely continuous center foliations , but the disintegration appears to be potentially much more complicated than just atomic disintegration @xcite .",
    "examining in greater depth the potential pathologies of center foliations , we discover a rigidity phenomenon . to be concrete , let us consider the case of a perturbation @xmath121 of the discretized geodesic flow on a negatively - curved surface .",
    "if the perturbation @xmath39 happens to be the time - one map of a smooth flow , then @xmath46 is the orbit foliation for that flow . in this case",
    "the center foliation for @xmath39 is absolutely continuous  in fact , @xmath109 . in general , however , a perturbation @xmath39 of @xmath35 has no reason to embed in a smooth flow , and one can ask how the volume @xmath16 disintegrates along the leaves of @xmath46 .",
    "there is a complete answer to this question :    [ t = avw ] let @xmath0 be a closed negatively curved surface , and let @xmath122 be the geodesic flow .    for each @xmath123",
    ", there is a neighborhood @xmath49 of @xmath35 in @xmath124 such that for each @xmath53 :    1 .",
    "either @xmath16 has atomic disintegration along the center foliation @xmath46 , or 2 .",
    "@xmath39 is the time - one map of a @xmath109 , @xmath16-preserving flow .",
    "what theorem  [ t = avw ] says is that , in this context , nothing lies between @xmath109 and absolute singularity of @xmath46  _ pathology is all that can happen_. the geometric measure - theoretic properties of @xmath46 determine completely a key dynamical property of @xmath39  whether it embeds in a flow .",
    "the heart of the proof of theorem  [ t = avw ] is to understand what happens when the center lyapunov exponents _",
    "vanish_. for this , we use tools that originate in the study of random matrix products .",
    "the general theme of this work , summarized by ledrappier in @xcite is that  entropy is smaller than exponents , and entropy zero implies deterministic . \"",
    "original results concerning the lyapunov exponents of random matrix products , due to furstenberg , kesten  @xcite , ledrappier  @xcite , and others , have been extended in the past decade to deterministic products of linear cocycles over hyperbolic systems by bonatti , gomez - mont , viana  @xcite .",
    "the bernoulli and markov measures associated with random products in those earlier works are replaced in the newer results by invariant measures for the hyperbolic system carrying a suitable product structure .",
    "recent work of avila , viana  @xcite extends this hyperbolic theory from linear to _ diffeomorphism _ cocycles , and these results are used in a central way . for cocycles over volume preserving partially hyperbolic systems ,",
    "avila , santamaria , and viana @xcite have also recently produced related results , for both linear and diffeomorphism cocycles , which also play an important role in the proof .",
    "the proof in @xcite employs julienne based techniques , generalizing the arguments in @xcite .",
    "_ further remarks .",
    "the only properties of @xmath35 that are used in the proof of theorem  [ t = avw ] are accessibility , dynamical coherence , one - dimensionality of @xmath66 , the fact that @xmath35 fixes the leaves of @xmath46 , and @xmath90-dimensionality of @xmath54 .",
    "there are also more general formulations of theorem  [ t = avw ] in @xcite that relax these hypotheses in various directions .",
    "for example , a similar result holds for systems in dimension @xmath90 for whom all center manifolds are compact .",
    "deep connections between lyapunov exponents and geometric properties of invariant measures have long been understood @xcite .",
    "theorem  [ t = avw ] establishes new connections in the partially hyperbolic context .",
    "3 .   theorem  [ t = avw ] gives conditions under which one can recover the action of a lie group ( in this case @xmath125 ) from that of a discrete subgroup ( in this case @xmath126 ) .",
    "these themes have arisen in the related context of measure - rigidity for algebraic partially hyperbolic actions by einsiedler , katok , lindenstrauss  @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to understand more deeply the connections between these works .",
    "we leave this tale open - ended , with a few questions that have arisen naturally in its course .    * new criteria for ergodicity .",
    "* conjecture  [ c = main ] remains open . as discussed in section  [ s = ergodicity ]",
    ", the julienne based techniques using the hopf argument might have reached their limits in this problem ( at least this is the case in the absence of a significantly new idea ) .",
    "one alternate approach which seems promising employs lyapunov exponents and blenders @xcite .",
    "perhaps a new approach will find a satisfying conclusion to this part of the story .",
    "* classification problem . *",
    "a basic question is to understand which manifolds support partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms . as the problem remains open in the classical anosov case (",
    "in which @xmath66 is zero - dimensional ) , it is surely exremely difficult in general .",
    "there has been significant progress in dimension @xmath90 , however ; for example , using techniques in the theory of codimension-@xmath92 foliations , burago and ivanov proved that there are no partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms of the @xmath90-sphere @xcite .    modifying this question slightly",
    ", one can ask whether the partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms in low dimension must belong to certain  classes \" ( up to homotopy , for example )  such as time-@xmath11 maps of flows , skew products , algebraic systems , and so on .",
    "pujals has proposed such a program in dimension @xmath90 , which has spurred several papers on the subject @xcite .",
    "it is possible that if one adds the hypotheses of dynamical coherence and absolute continuity of the center foliation , then there is such a classification .",
    "evidence in this direction can be found in @xcite",
    ".    * nonuniform and singular partial hyperbolicity . * unless all of its lyapunov exponents vanish almost everywhere , _",
    "any _ volume - preserving diffeomorphism is in some sense  nonuniformly partially hyperbolic . \"",
    "clearly such a general class of systems will not yield to a single approach .",
    "nonetheless , the techniques developed recently are quite powerful and should shed some light on certain systems that are close to being partially hyperbolic .",
    "some extensions beyond the uniform setting have been explored in @xcite , in which the center bunching hypotheses in @xcite has been replaced by a pointwise , nonuniform center bunching condition .",
    "this gives new classes of stably ergodic diffeomorphisms that are not center bunched .",
    "it is conceivable that the methods in @xcite may be further extended to apply in certain `` singular partially hyperbolic '' contexts where partial hyperbolicity holds on an open , noncompact subset of the manifold @xmath54 but decays in strength near the boundary .",
    "such conditions hold , for example , for geodesic flows on certain nonpositively curved manifolds . under suitable accessibility hypotheses , these systems should be ergodic with respect to volume .",
    "* rigidity of partially hyperbolic actions . *",
    "the rigidity phenomenon described in section  [ s = rigidity ] has only begun to be understood . to phrase those results in a more general context",
    ", we consider a smooth , nonsingular action of an abelian lie group @xmath127 on a manifold @xmath54 .",
    "let @xmath128 be a discrete group acting on @xmath54 , commuting with the action of @xmath127 , and whose elements are partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms in @xmath129 .",
    "can such an action be perturbed , preserving the absolute continuity of the center foliation ?",
    "how about the elements of the action ? when absolute continuity fails , what happens ?",
    "the role of accessibility and accessibility classes has been exploited in a serious way in the important work of damjanovi and a. katok on rigidity of abelian actions on quotients of @xmath130 @xcite .",
    "it seems reasonable that these explorations can be pushed further , using some of the techniques mentioned here , to prove rigidity results for other partially hyperbolic actions .",
    "a simple case currently beyond the reach of existing methods is to understand perturbations of the action of a @xmath131 lattice in the diagonal subgroup on @xmath132 , where @xmath7 is an irreducible lattice .",
    "our final question takes us further afield , but back once again to the geodesic flow .",
    "fix a closed hyperbolic surface @xmath0 , and consider the standard action on @xmath17 by the upper triangular subgroup @xmath133 , which contains both the geodesic and positive horocyclic flows .",
    "ghys proved that this action is highly rigid and admits no @xmath16-preserving @xmath109 deformations @xcite .",
    "does the same hold true for some countable subgroup of @xmath134 ?",
    "for example , consider the solvable baumslag solitar subgroup @xmath135 generated by the elements @xmath136 which has the presentation @xmath137 .",
    "can the standard action be perturbed inside of @xmath124 ?",
