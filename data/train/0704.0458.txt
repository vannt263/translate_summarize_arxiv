    "the galactic magnetic field is now recognized as a fundamental component of the interstellar medium , and plays a critical role in the formation and evolution of structures in the milky way .",
    "an important prediction in models of the large - scale magnetic field , in both the milky way and in other galaxies , is the existence of magnetic field reversals ( regions of magnetic shear across which the field changes direction by roughly 180@xmath2 ) .",
    "determining the number and location of these magnetic reversals is essential to understanding galactic evolution @xcite .",
    "while the majority of the recent studies suggest several large - scale reversals in the galaxy along its radius , it is interesting to note that most other galaxies exhibit either one reversal or none @xcite . is our galaxy unique this way , or is it simply a difference in observing methods ?",
    "the large - scale galactic magnetic field is concentrated in the disk , and is most often studied via observations of rotation measure ( rm ) , the measurable consequence of faraday rotation . for a source that emits linearly polarised radiation at an angle @xmath3 , the received radiation will have a polarisation angle at a wavelength , @xmath4 [ m ] , given by : @xmath5 where @xmath6 [ @xmath7 is the electron density and * b * [ @xmath8 g ] is the magnetic field along the propagation path * dl * [ pc ] .",
    "the rm integral is over the path from the source to the observer .    for more than four decades",
    ", the rms of both pulsars and extragalactic radio sources ( egs ) have been used to probe the galactic magnetic field .",
    "this has led to a series of clear conclusions .",
    "first , in the local spiral arm , the field is unquestionably directed clockwise ( cw ) , as viewed from the north galactic pole @xcite .",
    "the field in the first quadrant ( q1 ; @xmath9 ; see figure [ fig1 ] ) of the sagittarius - carina spiral arm is reversed relative to the local arm @xcite , implying a large - scale field reversal between the local arm and the q1 component of the sagittarius - carina arm .",
    "some evidence suggests that this reversed field extends into the fourth - quadrant ( q4 ; @xmath10 ) component of the sagittarius - carina arm ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    at larger distances ,",
    "the existence of other large - scale reversals in the galaxy remains unclear .",
    "ideally , reconstruction of the galactic magnetic field should utilize information from both pulsars and extragalactic sources .",
    "however , until recently there have been very few egs rms available at low - latitude that might be used to study the field in the disk .",
    "studies that have utilized pulsar rms alone are constrained by the comparatively sparse sampling of pulsars on the sky , which can make it difficult to map the field in complicated regions .",
    "three recent pulsar rm studies are as follows . using pulsar rms , @xcite investigated the existence and location of reversals in q1 , concluding that a reversal occurs between each arm so that the magnetic fields in adjacent arms are oppositely directed . while the evidence presented by @xcite for a reversal between the local arm and the sagittarius - carina arm in q1 is indisputable , their evidence for additional reversals is based on limited data , and they acknowledge that the evidence for a reversal into the q4-component of the sagittarius - carina arm is not well - defined .",
    "@xcite investigated azimuthal field configurations in the galaxy using pulsar rms averaged in concentric rings .",
    "he concluded that best - fit for this model was an overall clockwise magnetic field with a 2 kpc wide counter - clockwise ( ccw ) ring , located between 4 and 6 kpc from the galactic center ( note that a non - standard solar - circle radius of 7.2 kpc was assumed in this study ) . in this model",
    ", the galactic field has two large - scale reversals , and the q1 component of the sagittarius - carina arm is ccw , while the q4 component is cw .    using 223 new pulsar rm observations primarily in the fourth quadrant , in conjunction with previous pulsar rms , @xcite concluded there is a reversal at every arm - interarm boundary , so that the fields in the arms are directed ccw , and the interarm regions are directed cw .",
    "a potential inconsistency with this model is that the majority of the pulsars distributed along the q4 component of the sagittarius - carina spiral arm have what @xcite describe as ` unexpectedly positive ' rms , which they suggest is the influence of hii regions along the lines - of - sight to the affected pulsars ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "recent surveys of the galactic plane at high resolution and at multiple wavelengths have assisted greatly in the study of the galactic magnetic field by addressing the previous paucity of low - latitude egs rm data ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "one such survey is the southern galactic plane survey ( sgps ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the sgps images low latitudes in the third and fourth quadrants of the galaxy , complementing the canadian galactic plane survey in the northern hemisphere ( cgps ; * ? ? ?",
    "rotation measures calculated from these data were used by @xcite to explore the structure of the small - scale field . here , we present the tabulation of these rms and use them to examine the structure of the large - scale field .",
    "the initial set of observations for the sgps ( ie .",
    "phase i ) spans an area of @xmath11 and @xmath1 .",
    "the observations were done with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) in new south wales , australia . for details about the sgps observations and polarimetric data reduction , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "rms were calculated using twelve separate 8 mhz bands centered on frequencies between 1336 mhz and 1432 mhz .",
    "the proximity of the 8 mhz bands allows for unambiguous rm calculations using the algorithm designed by @xcite for the cgps , with appropriate modifications for the atca .",
    "specifically , an rm calculation was considered reliable if the source was sufficiently polarized ( @xmath120.3% ) , had sufficient signal to noise ( @xmath122 ) across at least 3 pixels , was faraday thin @xcite , and had a consistent value across the source .    of the 215 polarised source candidates identified , 148 sources had rms that successfully passed the screening tests discussed above .",
    "these new data are given in table 1 .",
    "three of our 148 sources had a rm determined by @xcite , as part of the sgps test region ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the previously determined values of these sources are within the errors of the new values quoted in table 1 .",
    "these sources are indicated by footnote marker @xmath14 .",
    "two additional test region rm sources fall within the latitude range of the sgps but they lie within the noise perimeter of our data ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and were not observable .",
    "there is one other previously observed rm from an egs , reported by @xcite , that falls within our field at @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "this source is resolved in the sgps and exhibits a large gradient across the source .",
    "consequently , it failed the screening , though its calculated rm ( @xmath17 rad m@xmath18 ) is in agreement with the previously determined value ( @xmath19 rad m@xmath18 ) .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows the rms of egs and pulsars in the sgps region .",
    "most of the pulsars ( 99 of 120 ) are from @xcite .",
    "the remaining are from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the most striking feature of figure [ fig2 ] is the change in sign of rm from predominantly positive at low longitudes to predominantly negative at high longitudes for both the pulsars and egs at @xmath20 , though it is more prominent for the egs .",
    "a change in sign of the overall trend in rm can only come from a change of direction in the dominant line - of - sight component of the magnetic field .",
    "the fact that the rm sign change is abrupt indicates that this directional change is the result of a physical field reversal , rather than a viewing angle effect such as that observed towards @xmath21 ( eg .",
    "furthermore , the abruptness indicates a thin current sheet and an associated large gradient in the magnetic field @xcite .    by averaging the egs rms in @xmath22 across the sky to reduce small - scale variations ( for example , due to the small - scale field or intrinsic effects from the egs themselves )",
    ", we can obtain more information about the large - scale field .",
    "the top panel in figure [ fig3 ] shows the rm data from the sgps , both raw and binned plotted as a function of galactic longitude .",
    "the middle panel shows these data smoothed . in all three presentations of the egs data ,",
    "an oscillating pattern of rm with longitude is visible .",
    "the transition from positive to negative rms remains at @xmath23 , indicated by the solid vertical line . in the bottom panel of figure [ fig3 ] , we plot the individual pulsar rms as a function of galactic longitude .",
    "these data were not averaged in @xmath22 because of the variation and uncertainty in the pulsar distances . in spite of this , there are features seen here similar to the oscillatory pattern observed in the egs data .",
    "the dashed and dotted lines in the middle panel of figure [ fig3 ] are the approximate longitudes of @xmath24rm@xmath24 maxima and minima respectively for the sgps data . in figure",
    "[ fig1 ] , we show these lines as lines - of - sight overlaid on a top - down view of the galaxy where the grey scale is the galactic electron density model of @xcite , hereafter cl02 .",
    "interestingly , the blue dashed lines ( @xmath24rm@xmath24 maxima ) tend to have the longest continuous fraction of their length along a spiral arm or through the central annulus put in the cl02 to correspond to the molecular ring .",
    "this is consistent with the expectation that egs rms should be dominated by the spiral arms as a result of the higher electron densities in these regions @xcite .",
    "the strong positive rms in the longitude range around @xmath25 , seen in both the egs and pulsars , suggest the magnetic field in the q4-component of the sagittarius - carina arm is directed cw .",
    "the same conclusion was reached by @xcite using data from a distant supernova remnant .",
    "this cw field presents a simple explanation for the positive pulsar rms identified by @xcite as part of a ` carina anomaly ' .    similarly , the strong negative rms in the longitude range around @xmath26 suggest the magnetic field in the q4-component of the scutum  crux arm is directed ccw",
    ". therefore , a magnetic field reversal must reside between the sagittarius ",
    "carina arm and the scutum  crux arm in q4 .",
    "furthermore , the strong evidence for a field reversal between the local and sagittarius  carina arms in q1 suggests the reversal must slice through the sagittarius ",
    "carina arm if this reversal is continuous between q1 and q4 , such as in the model proposed by @xcite .",
    "the subsequently implied lack of alignment of the magnetic field with the sagittarius - carina arm is consistent with earlier observations of at least a @xmath27 offset in pitch angle between the orientation of the local field and that of the local spiral arm @xcite .",
    "as a separate approach to qualitative observational analysis of the data , we can fit global magnetic field models to the rm data ( with assumptions regarding the electron distribution in the galaxy ) , to explore the structure of the uniform field and the location or existence of magnetic field reversals . here",
    "we use the cl02 electron density model and the technique of @xcite which uses linear inversion theory @xcite to obtain a least - squares fit to the data . with this method ,",
    "the boundaries of magnetic field regions are fixed _ a priori _ but the strength and direction of the field within these regions are not .",
    "the model is fit to the observed rms to derive the strength and direction within each region .",
    "this contrasts previous analyses which also employed separate models for the electron density and magnetic field , but where the direction of the field was an input to the model ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we present here a simple model where we consider nine magnetic field regions , eight of which are either arm or interarm regions , and the ninth corresponds to the molecular ring .",
    "this model does not include the differing pitch angle between the magnetic and spiral arms discussed in section [ sec3 ] , but is instead designed to be directly comparable with the results of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the region boundaries are delineated by the green spirals in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "the constraints for the model field within each arm or interarm region are : 1 ) a log - spiral with a pitch angle of 11.5@xmath28 as shown ; 2 ) a field strength that is inversely proportional to galactic radius ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; 3 ) a zero vertical component ; 4 ) a coherent direction within each region .",
    "we set the magnetic field within the molecular ring to have the same constraints as in the arms , except that the field is assumed to be purely azimuthal . at galactic radii less than 3 kpc or greater than 20 kpc , or at more than 1 kpc from the mid - plane , the field",
    "is set to zero .",
    "we constrain the model using rm data from individual sources only within the sgps region ( 120 pulsars , 148 sgps egs , and 1 egs from broten et .",
    "al 1988 ; see sections [ sec2 ] and [ sec3 ] ) . for modeling purposes , we assume that the intergalactic contribution to the egs rms is negligible @xcite , so that the egs may be considered to reside at galactocentric radii of 20 kpc .",
    "most of the published pulsar distances used are based on the cl02 model , and are therefore consistent with this model . as a consequence of the limited sky coverage of the rm data used here",
    ", we confine our analysis of the result to within the sgps longitudes .",
    "the best - fit output for this model is a cw field everywhere except for a ccw field in the scutum - crux arm and in the molecular ring , as shown in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] shows a plot of both the measured and modeled rms for the individual sgps egs data ( top panel ) , these data averaged and smoothed as in the middle panel of figure [ fig3 ] ( middle panel ) , and the measured and modeled rms for individual pulsars ( bottom panel ) .",
    "this model is able to closely reproduce the rm structure seen in the smoothed sgps egs data ( recall that the fit is to the individual egs and pulsar data ) . however , there are two ( relatively small ) discrepancies between the model and the observed data towards the outer galaxy .",
    "the first is in the vicinity around @xmath29 , where the measured data are more negative than the modeled data as also seen in the top panel figure [ fig5 ] . in figure [ fig2 ] , there is a contained region of small , negative rm between @xmath30 at @xmath31 , resembling a magnetic bubble like that discussed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "rms at these longitudes nominally should be dominated by the field in the local arm .",
    "thus , if the negative rms seen here were to be attributed to the large - scale field , this would imply that the field is directed counter - clockwise in the local arm .",
    "this is contrary to the many studies that show the field is clockwise in the local arm , as discussed in section [ sec1 ] .",
    "interestingly , this region was previously identified in the parkes 2.4-ghz survey as containing a polarized feature of unknown origin @xcite .",
    "since the lines - of - sight in the outer galaxy are considerably smaller through the interstellar medium , compared to lines - of - sight through the inner galaxy , it is likely that this localized feature is dominating the rm for these egs . as a result",
    ", averaging the negative rms through this localized feature with the otherwise positive rms of the local arm creates the effect of @xmath32 at @xmath33 .",
    "the other discrepancy is around @xmath34 where the measured rms are more positive than the modeled rms .",
    "lines - of - sight at this longitude are again through the outer galaxy where localized features including the gum nebula @xcite could dominate the rm . as seen in the top panel of figure [ fig3 ] there are two egs sources at @xmath35 that have rms roughly double that of neighboring sources which biases the average rm near this longitude .",
    "interestingly , there is also a localized peak in the pulsar data near this longitude , as seen in the bottom panel of figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "the model tries to fit both the negative region around @xmath36 and the more positive region around @xmath34 , with the result being a compromise between the two .",
    "although the individual pulsar data are noisier than the averaged egs data , the trends of the pulsar data are also reproduced by this model . in particular , the model supports our observational conclusion that the q4-component of the sagittarius - carina arm is directed cw , while the q4-component of the scutum - crux arm is directed ccw .",
    "finally , we note that the direction of the norma arm field is not well constrained by this model or by the data . regardless of whether the field in the norma arm is oriented cw or ccw , the results from this model contrast the previous suggestions of reversals with every arm @xcite or at every arm - interarm boundary @xcite .",
    "we present the rotation measures for 148 extragalactic sources found in the southern galactic plane survey .",
    "the oscillations of rotation measure with longitude revealed by these sources , and as also seen in pulsar rm data , highlight the dominating effect of the spiral arms on rotation measure . both empirically and with a direct fit to measurements , the new data show conclusively that the field is directed clockwise in the fourth - quadrant component of the sagittarius - carina arm , and that a field reversal exists between the sagittarius - carina arm and the scutum - crux arms in the fourth quadrant .",
    "a definitive measurement of the number of large - scale magnetic reversals in the galaxy can only emerge from an analysis that includes pulsar and egs rm data at all galactic longitudes , and which considers a wide range of distinct field configurations .",
    "in addition , the technique presented here is constrained to geometries imposed by the cl02 model . with these caveats ,",
    "the results from our study of southern rms indicate that far fewer magnetic reversals are needed to explain the data than other recent studies have suggested .",

    "<S> we present new faraday rotation measures ( rms ) for 148 extragalactic radio sources behind the southern galactic plane ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) , and use these data in combination with published data to probe the large - scale structure of the milky way s magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the magnitudes of these rms oscillate with longitude in a manner that correlates with the locations of the galactic spiral arms . </S>",
    "<S> the observed pattern in rms requires the presence of at least one large - scale magnetic reversal in the fourth galactic quadrant , located between the sagittarius - carina and scutum - crux spiral arms . to quantitatively compare our measurements to other recent studies </S>",
    "<S> , we consider all available extragalactic and pulsar rms in the region we have surveyed , and jointly fit these data to simple models in which the large - scale field follows the spiral arms . in the best - fitting model , the magnetic field in the fourth galactic quadrant is directed clockwise in the sagittarius - carina spiral arm ( as viewed from the north galactic pole ) , but is oriented counter - clockwise in the scutum - crux arm . </S>",
    "<S> this contrasts with recent analyses of pulsar rms alone , in which the fourth - quadrant field was presumed to be directed counter - clockwise in the sagittarius - carina arm . </S>",
    "<S> also in contrast to recent pulsar rm studies , our joint modeling of pulsar and extragalactic rms demonstrates that large numbers of large - scale magnetic field reversals are not required to account for observations . </S>"
