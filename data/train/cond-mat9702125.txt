    "up to date much theoretical work has been devoted to the problem of a hole motion in two dimensional ( 2d ) s=1/2 quantum antiferromagnet ( afm ) @xcite .",
    "the important question is whether a hole injected in the undoped ground state behaves like a quasiparticle ( qp ) .",
    "this problem is mainly investigated within the framework of self - consistent born approximation ( scba ) for the @xmath8 model @xcite and kondo - lattice @xcite .",
    "there are rather few works devoted to the three - band hubbard model or the emery model @xcite that is more realistic for cuo@xmath1 planes in high- @xmath9 superconductors ( htsc ) . for the @xmath10 model",
    "it was shown that the spectral density function @xmath11 of a doped hole revealed a qp peak of intensity @xmath12 and a broad incoherent part that has a width of about @xmath13 .",
    "the qp band bottom corresponds to the momenta @xmath14 .",
    "similar results were obtained for the emery model @xcite .",
    "the presence of a great incoherent part and small intensity of qp peak indicate , that bare holes are rather poor elementary excitations even for @xmath15 close to @xmath16 .    in order to investigate",
    "the hole motion in the @xmath8 model one usually decouple the hole operator into a spinless fermion and an antiferromagnetic magnon operator . as a result",
    "the zero approximation corresponds to the dispersionless band with zero energy of the hole .",
    "the hopping of the particle appears only due to the fermion - magnon scattering which is treated by the usual perturbation method in @xmath15-space .",
    "for this reason we think that in this approach the resulting quasiparticle pole in the fermion green s function takes into account mainly a polaron of a large radius .",
    "the close situation takes place in the usual treatment of a hole motion in the effective three - band model @xcite and the kondo - lattice model @xcite , when one starts from a bare hole , not from a magnetic polaron of a small radius .    in the present paper , within the framework of the effective three - band model we study the spectral density function @xmath17 of a single small polaron , i.e .",
    ", an excitation which takes into account from the very beginning a local hole - spin coupling .",
    "it is well known that the simplest candidate for such a small polaron is an analog of the so - called zhang - rice singlet in cuo@xmath18 plaquette @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the mean - field spectrum @xmath19 of this excitation is well studied @xcite and it will be used as the zero approximation in our treatment .",
    "we shall consider the coupling of small polaron to spin - wave excitations within the self - consistent born approximation ( scba ) for the corresponding two - time retarded green s function @xmath0 .",
    "our motivations to study @xmath17 and the corresponding quasiparticle band are the following .",
    "first , it may be easily shown for the one - hole problem that the mean - field energy of the polaron @xmath19 represents the center of gravity of the spectral function    @xmath20    this means that the minimum of @xmath19 is the upper bound of the actual position for the quasiparticle band bottom .",
    "the scba , based on a bare hole green s function , gives the minimum value of quasiparticle energy equal to @xmath21 @xcite , for a typical value of copper - copper afm exchange constant @xmath22 .",
    "here @xmath3 is a constant of the effective oxygen - oxygen hopping via an intervening copper site ( note that our unit of energy is twice that of ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath23 ) . as to the value of the small polaron mean field band bottom it turns out to be substantially lower than @xmath24 , @xmath25 , for the same value of @xmath26 .",
    "so we may conclude that important local correlations are lost in scba when we start from the bare hole operators .",
    "secondly , we shall show that a small polaron represents the elementary hole excitation much more better than a bare hole dressed by magnons within the framework of scba .",
    "this will be manifested by a relatively great intensity of a quasiparticle peak in our calculation .",
    "finally , the mean field spectrum @xmath19 of the simplest small spin polaron explicitly depends on the state of the antiferromagnetic background . in the case of long range order state",
    ", @xmath19 demonstrates a flat band region close to the magnetic brillouin zone boundary @xcite .",
    "this region corresponds to the bottom of the band .",
    "moreover , if one takes into account the direct oxygen - oxygen hopping , finite temperature and a more complicated form for a small polaron wave function , then @xmath19 reproduces the experimentally observed extended saddle point which is directed along the line @xmath27 @xcite . therefore it seems important to clear up if the quasiparticle band reproduces the peculiarities of @xmath28 dispersion .",
    "below we study this question for the simplest variant of the model .",
    "the distinctive feature of our investigation consists in considering the afm copper spin subsystem in a spherically symmetric approach @xcite .",
    "such an approach is the most appropriate for treating the quantum 2d afm at any finite temperature . as a result",
    "the scattering of a spin polaron by spin excitations in the singlet spin background leads to the spectral function periodicity relative to the full brillouin zone .",
    "note that the conventional two - sublattice spin approach leads to periodicity relative to the magnetic ( reduced ) brillouin zone @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section ii",
    "we give the derivations for the self - consistent equation for the green s function in the case of the small polaron approach . in section",
    "iii we present the procedure that provides the opportunity to avoid the iterative solution of the self - consistent equation for complex energies .",
    "the procedure is based on the continued fraction ( cf ) expansion of green s function and it gives a possibility to calculate consequently the coefficients of the cf expansion with the use of the quadrature method . in section",
    "iv we offer the termination of the continued fraction which leads to the correct analytical properties of the resulting green s function .",
    "numerical results for the self - energies and spectral functions , the relation of our results to the previous approaches and discussion are given in section v. section vi summarizes the results .",
    "an appendix contains some details of the approach which gives the expression for integrals over the spectral density in terms of the chain representation of continuous fraction .",
    "part of our results were presented in brief reports @xcite .",
    "the paper presented here gives further results as well as the description of the new method and more details about the calculations .",
    "following refs.@xcite we adopt the hamiltonian that corresponds to one hole problem in the cuo@xmath1 plane in htsc : @xmath29 @xmath30    here and below @xmath31 are basic vectors of a copper square lattice ( @xmath32 ) , @xmath33 are four vectors of o sites nearest to the cu site @xmath34 , the operator @xmath35 creates a hole with the spin index @xmath36 at the o site , @xmath37 , operator @xmath38 represents the localized spin on the copper site . as mentioned above @xmath3 is the integral of oxygen hole hoppings that takes into account the coupling of the hole motion with copper spin subsystem .",
    "@xmath2 is the constant of nearest neighbor afm exchange between the copper spins .",
    "it is well known that the most prominent feature of the hamiltonian ( [ hamtot ] ) is that the low - energy physics of hole excitations is described by the bloch sums @xmath39 based on one site small polaron operators @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath42 @xmath43 here @xmath44 $ ] stand for an anticommutator and commutator , respectively ; @xmath45,\\hspace{\\parindent } q = sp{\\rm e}^{-\\beta h}$ ] .",
    "@xmath46 implies taking the trace of an operator , @xmath47 is an inverse temperature ; @xmath48 ; @xmath49 are the hubbard projection operators for cu sites states ; @xmath50 .    to calculate the average for commutators and anticommutators such as @xmath51 , we take into account that these expressions are reduced to the two - site or three - site averages of the hubbard operators located at different copper sites . in the spherically symmetric approach",
    "adopted here , all these averages can be expressed in terms of the two - site spin correlation functions @xmath52 .",
    "let us recall that due to the spherical symmetry @xmath53 , @xmath54 .",
    "simultaneously , at @xmath55 the spin subsystem is described by a long range order state with finite effective magnetization @xmath56 , @xmath57 , the value of @xmath56 is dictated by the bose condensation of spin excitations at the antiferromagnetic vector @xmath58 .",
    "note , that @xmath59 corresponds to the cuo@xmath1 plane state with the total spin equal to @xmath60 if @xmath61 as a candidate for the elementary excitations operator and calculate the corresponding two - time retarded green s function @xmath0 and spectral density @xmath62 @xmath63    the dyson s equation for @xmath0 has the form @xmath64 where @xmath65=\\frac 1{\\sqrt{nk_{{\\bf k}}}}\\sum_{{\\bf r}}{\\rm e } ^{-\\imath { \\bf k\\cdot r}}{\\cal r}_{{\\bf r},\\sigma } , \\ ] ] @xmath66 @xmath67 @xmath68 @xmath69 @xmath70 @xmath71 @xmath72 here and below @xmath73 .",
    "we see from eqs.([dy ] ) and ( [ rirr ] ) , that the self - energy @xmath74 accounting for interaction effects is expressed through the higher - order green s functions .",
    "one should notice , first , that the terms linear in @xmath75 do not contribute to the irreducible green s function ( [ rirr ] ) .",
    "second , the lowest - order self - energy contribution is provided by the first term in the right - hand side of the expression ( [ rirr ] ) , while the second term leads to higher - order corrections .",
    "following ref.@xcite we evaluate ( [ rirr ] ) with a proper decoupling procedure for two time correlation function @xmath76 .",
    "this procedure is equivalent to the self - consistent born approximation in a usual diagrammatic technique @xcite . in our case",
    "this means that the two - time correlation function is decoupled into the spin - spin correlation function and the polaron - polaron correlation function .",
    "the adopted decoupling procedure preserves the main character of polaron site operator ( [ singl ] ) - four hole site operators surround the copper spin operator .",
    "it schematically has the form @xmath77 @xmath78 let us mention that we also tested the more complex decoupling procedure , and it did not qualitatively alter the results given by approximation ( [ decu ] ) . on the next step we project polaron operators in ( [ decu ] ) onto @xmath79 : @xmath80    taking into account , that we shall calculate only the irreducible part of green s function ( [ rirr ] ) , the averages @xmath81 are transformed to corresponding spin - spin correlation functions @xmath82 . collecting all terms ,",

    "we come to the integral equation for the green s function that always arises within the framework of scba @xmath94    where @xmath95 , \\ ] ] @xmath96 $ ] is the bose function , @xmath97    @xmath98 corresponds to the bare vertex for the coupling between a spin polaron and a spin wave .",
    "it is known @xcite that this vertex is substantially renormalized for @xmath99 close to the afm vector @xmath100 .",
    "this renormalization is due to the strong interaction of a polaron with the condensation part of spin excitations that must be taken into account from the very beginning . as a result",
    ", the renormalized vertex @xmath101 must be proportional to @xcite @xmath102 ^{1/2}$ ] , @xmath103 being the spin - spin correlation length , @xmath104 in our case of a long range order state of the spin subsystem .",
    "below this renormalization is taken into account empirically by the substitution @xmath105 the introduced vertex correction is proportional to @xmath106 for @xmath99 close to @xmath107 .",
    "we have used also the following two functions for the vertex correction @xmath108 and @xmath109 and have obtained the results similar to those presented below .",
    "let us mention that the bare vertex leads the dramatic decrease of the qp bandwidth .",
    "the equation ( [ gineq ] ) is usually solved by an iteration procedure .",
    "we propose here an alternative way , based on the continued fraction expansion of @xmath110    @xmath111    where @xmath112    the coefficients @xmath113 are related with the spectral density @xmath4 via the set of orthogonal polynomials @xmath114 , satisfying the recurrence @xcite : @xmath115    @xmath116    and @xmath117 @xmath118    here we have used the nonnormalized form of the polynomials @xmath119 .    comparing eqs.([cf1 ] ) and ( [ gineq ] ) we see that the self energy @xmath120 is the continued fraction similar to @xmath121 . thus we can introduce the spectral density    @xmath122/\\pi\\ ] ] and the set of polynomials",

    "as it was proved by nex @xcite such integrals may be expressed through the coefficients @xmath134.the details of such a procedure are presented in the appendix .",
    "so , it turns out that in scba we can recursively calculate pairs of coefficients @xmath135and to obtain @xmath136 in the continued fraction form .",
    "of course we must calculate the coefficients at all the chosen @xmath137 points in the first brillouin zone simultaneously .",
    "below the chosen points correspond to a lattice of @xmath138 unit cells.the presented procedure provides the opportunity to avoid the iterative solution of eq.([gineq ] ) for complex energies .",
    "the procedure outlined in the previous section would be efficient if after calculating a finite number of coefficients @xmath139 , we could appropriately approximate the part ( infinite in our case ) of the continued fraction @xmath140 , which has not been calculated . in other words , we rewrite the expression ( [ cf1 ] ) in the form @xmath141 and try to find a function @xmath142 ( so called  terminator  ) that is close to @xmath140 .",
    "various ways to construct such approximations are described in the literature on the recursion method ( see refs.@xcite ) .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of continued fraction coefficients is governed by the band structure and singularities of spectral density @xcite .",
    "the main asymptotic behavior depends on the band structure : @xmath143 and @xmath144 converge towards limits in the single band case , oscillate endlessly in a predictable way in the multiband case .",
    "damped oscillations are created by isolated singularities .",
    "the main point here is that an isolated simple pole produces _ exponentially _ damped contribution in @xmath145 , @xmath146 . for our case",
    "it means that the quasiparticle pole position and weight could be obtained with the high accuracy from finite number of coefficients , and the asymptotic behavior determines the incoherent part of the spectrum .",
    "it is obvious that the spectrum we deal with has an lower bound and no upper bound .",
    "we can thus expect that coefficients will not converge to some finite values but will grow up to infinity .    in fig.[f1 ]",
    "we represent the coefficients @xmath147 as functions on @xmath148 calculated according the procedure described in the preceding section for two values of @xmath2 , @xmath22 and @xmath149 and for @xmath150 .",
    "as it may be seen , the distinctive feature of this dependence is that for large @xmath148 the coefficients @xmath147 are linear functions of @xmath148 .",
    "for all this , the slope for @xmath151 coefficients is twice as many as the slope for @xmath152 .",
    "so the coefficients behavior may be approximated as    @xmath153    it is interesting that the analogous behavior show the coefficients for @xmath8 model approximated by slave - fermion hamiltonian @xcite treated within the self - consistent born approximation @xcite . for @xmath154 the coefficients @xmath147 dictated by the relation analogous to ( [ gineq1 ] )",

( [ asab ] ) and ( [ gami7 ] ) for large @xmath148 , when @xmath164 , we see that the substitution @xmath165 leads to the function @xmath166 @xmath167 that has the same asymptotic as @xmath110 ( [ cf1 ] ) .",

    "we thus obtain @xmath110 in the whole complex energy plane including the real axis .",
    "note that usually the procedure of discretizing the energy range @xmath132 is used for iteration process when the dyson s equation is solved numerically .",
    "it is not obvious that such a self - consistent solution leads to the correct analytical properties of the resulting green s function .",
    "in contrast the continued fraction representation guarantees these properties ( e.g. the positive definiteness of spectral function @xmath173 ) .",

    "the comparison of fig.[f2 ] ( b),(c),(d ) and the corresponding functions given by fig.7,8 from ref.@xcite ( the same lattice size and @xmath182 ) demonstrates that the position of peaks of the hole spectral function and their intensities coincide .",

    "we do not represent the results for large @xmath2 , @xmath261 , as our approach in the present form fails to describe this limit . here , from the very beginning we treat a small polaron by a single site operator @xmath262 ( [ singl ] ) .",
    "for large @xmath2 the mean field static energy of such a state is proportional to @xmath2 and such a state is unstable .",
    "so in this limit we must extend the basis of site operators .",
    "the simplest way is to include in the basis the additional operator of a bare hole . in scba approximation",
    "this will lead to the system of two selfconsistent equations . as a result",
    "all effects of spin subsystem - hole interaction will be proportional to @xmath263 .",
    "the more general procedure for the extending of the small polaron operator basis is outlined in @xcite .",

    "the two - time retarded green s function was calculated within the framework of self - consistent born approximation for @xmath138 cell lattice .",
    "we have shown that spin polaron of small radius represents a good approximation to the true quasiparticle low - energy excitation even at mean - field level .",
    "the account of the self - energy does not crucially change the polaron motion picture for realistic values of parameters . for quasimomenta @xmath15 values ,",
    "corresponding to the band bottom , most of the total spectral weight is concentrated in the quasiparticle peak ( table [ t1 ] ) . in the same region of @xmath15-space",
    "the shape of the qp dispersion curve @xmath200 reproduces that of mean - field dispersion @xmath19(fig.[f4 ] ) .",
    "we compare our results with previous investigations@xcite that start from the bare hole .",
    "we see that the small polaron mean - field energy @xmath264 lies much lower than the qp pole obtained from scba for the bare hole .",
    "since @xmath28 determines the center of gravity for the green s function spectral density the actual qp pole position ( at least for the band bottom ) should lie deeper in energy than @xmath265 ( figs .",
    "[ f3 ] and [ f6]).this means that in the three - band model the important local correlations should be taken into account in zero approximation and small spin polaron should be constructed .",
    "then the polaron scattering on spin waves is of less importance and it may be treated by perturbation methods .",
    "the conclusion is that the low - energy physics of high-@xmath9 superconductors should be considered in terms of small spin polaron dynamics . in particular , that the problem of superconducting hole pairing must be treated as pairing of these quasiparticles rather than pairing of bare holes .",
