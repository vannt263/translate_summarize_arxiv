    "a deterministic and perfect quantum cloner for arbitrary quantum states is forbidden by the quantum no - cloning theorem@xcite . as an extension ,",
    "yuen and dariano@xcite showed that a violation of unitarity makes the cloning of two nonorthogonal states also impossible .",
    "then the case of mixed states is considered and it is shown that two noncommuting mixed states can not be broadcast , even when the state need only be reproduced marginally on the separate systems . for further consideration , koashi and imoto@xcite generalized the standard no - cloning theorem to the entangled states .",
    "their research showed to what extent the correlation to other systems can be read out from a subsystem without altering its marginal density operators .    after having considered about so many restrictions posed on cloning quantum states by quantum mechanics , people began to think about how to do our best in quantum states cloning under all these restrictions , that is , the inaccurate cloning of quantum states . these approached may be divided into two main categories : universal and state - dependent .",
    "state - dependent quantum cloning machines are designed to clone states belonging to a finite set .",
    "it can be divided into three subcategories : deterministic@xcite , probabilistic exact@xcite and hybrid@xcite .    on the other hand , universal quantum cloning machines deterministically generates approximate copies of an unknown quantum state .",
    "the word `` universal '' means that this kind of machines works equally well for any input states , i.e. , state - independent .",
    "this category can again be divided into two subcategories : symmetric and asymmetric .",
    "asymmetric universal quantum cloning machines which introduced by cerf and buek et al@xcite produce two non - identical imperfect copies of a single state of @xmath1-dimensional quantum system .",
    "symmetric universal quantum cloning machines , first designed by buek and hillery@xcite , works in a different way : act on any unknown quantum state and produce identical approximate copies equally well .",
    "this kind of buek - hillery cloning machine has been optimized and generalized@xcite .",
    "quantum cloning may be used to improve the performance of some quantum computation tasks@xcite and may be heleful in understanding quantum information theory and processing quantum imformation , and might be helpful in eavesdropping versus quantum cryptography@xcite . and we can improve the performance of the measurements on observables by performing measurements on clones of the original quantum system@xcite .    in the present paper , we realized the one - to - two qubits buek - hillery cloning machine with linear optical devices .",
    "this method relies on the representation of several qubits by a single photon .",
    "we showed that , the fidelities between the two output qubits and the original qubit are both @xmath2 ( which proved to be the optimal fidelity of one - to - two qubits universal cloner ) for arbitrary input pure states .",
    "the most important quality of symmetric universal cloning machines is how well we can do , i.e. , the optimal fidelity .",
    "we use the most usual definition of fidelity @xmath3 . for convenience ,",
    "we only discuss the case when the input states are pure .",
    "here,@xmath4 is the to - be - cloned unknown pure state and @xmath5 is the density matrix of one of the output copies .",
    "a @xmath6 symmetric universal quantum cloning machine is described as the following ( for qubit systems ) :    \\1 .",
    "the input system contains @xmath7 original qubits , each in the same unknown pure state @xmath8 , @xmath9 `` blank '' qubits @xmath10 and @xmath11 auxiliary qubits @xmath10 .",
    "the cloning machine acts on the input system and performs a prescribed unitary transformation @xmath12 on it .",
    "the output system contains @xmath1 identical copies ( usually entangled ) , each copy described by a reduced density matrix @xmath13 @xmath14 , and @xmath11 auxiliary qubits .",
    "the cloning process can be written as    @xmath15    for @xmath16 , there exists @xmath1 qubits such that each of them has the same reduced density matrix @xmath17 .    for the @xmath6 symmetric universal quantum cloning machine described above , the optimal fidelity has been demonstrated as@xcite    @xmath18    from the equation we can see that the optimal @xmath19 fidelity is @xmath2 .    the special unitary transformation @xmath12 of the one - to - two buek - hillery cloning machine can be written as@xcite @xmath20    where    @xmath21    in the cloning process , the quantum information in the original qubit ( the first qubit ) is copied to qubits @xmath22 and @xmath23 equally well such that the reduced density matrixes at the output are identical , i.e. , @xmath24 .",
    "the third qubit acts as an auxiliary qubit here .    from the specific expression of the unitary transformation @xmath12 given above we can easily calculate the fidelities @xmath25    where @xmath8 is an arbitrary unknown pure state    @xmath26    so , it is shown to be an optimal symmetric universal cloning machine .    in order to realize the transformation @xmath12 in experiment",
    ", we first have to construct the quantum logic circuit . to do that , @xmath12 is decomposed into a sequence of basic operations such as the rotation of a single qubit and the controlled - not ( cnot ) operation of two qubits@xcite .",
    "the final network of the cloning machine@xcite has been shown in figure 1 .",
    "we note that the network is divided into two parts ( except the state swapping part ) : preparation and cloning . in the preparation stage ,",
    "qubit 1 is left unaffected and qubit 2 and 3 are entangled by cnot gates .",
    "that is , there is no `` flow '' of quantum information from qubit 1 to qubit 2 , 3 .",
    "then , in the cloning stage , the quantum information in qubit 1 is `` redistributed '' among the three qubits by a sequence of four cnot gates .",
    "the unitary transformations in the two stages are described as@xcite    @xmath27is prepared by three ratations and two cnot operations    @xmath28    the rotation angles @xmath29 @xmath30 are determined by the specific @xmath31 reads    @xmath32    although there is no flow of information in the preparation stage , we note that we can controll the distribution of information among the three qubits by the choice of the ratation angles@xcite .",
    "we can copy qubit 1 to qubits 1 and 2 or qubits 2 and 3 , even copy qubit 1 to qubits 1 , 2 and 3 when the input state @xmath8 is    @xmath33    this is called quantum triplicator .",
    "now we concentrate on constructing the network given in figure 1 with linear optical devices .",
    "the basic idea is the representation of several qubits by a single photon .",
    "in such a scheme , qubits are represented by different freedom degrees of a single photon , i.e. , a photon can carry one polarization qubit and several location qubits@xcite .",
    "two orthogonal linear polarization states of the photon , i.e. , horizontal and vertical , serve as the basis states of the polarization qubit . hereafter ,",
    "they are denoted by @xmath34 and @xmath35 corresponding to @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "any of the location qubits is characterized by the information about `` which path '' is taken by the photon when passing a beam splitter . in this way ,",
    "entanglement of different qubits can be accomplished conveniently , and decoherence is very low because the photons have relatively less interaction with the environment .    in our scheme of universal quantum cloning ,",
    "three qubits are involved : one polarization ( qubit @xmath22 ) and two location qubits ( qubits @xmath23 and @xmath38 ) .",
    "qubit @xmath22 is the initial to - be - cloned qubit in an arbitrary state @xmath39 , which is cloned to qubits @xmath22 and @xmath23 at the output end with qubit @xmath38 serving as an ancilla .",
    "both location qubits are initially in blank states : @xmath40 and @xmath41 .    to realize the network in figure 1",
    ", we must construct cnot gates between any two qubits and unitary rotation of any single qubit . with",
    "the representation of qubits mentioned above , all these gates can be made with linear devices@xcite . however , in previous schemes@xcite , a unitary rotation to a single location qubit is realized by a shiftable beam splitter ( bs ) or a mach - zehnder ( m - z ) interferometer .",
    "unfortunately , a shiftable bs is infeasible and an m - z interferometer will inevitably multiply the complexity .    to overcome this difficulty , a trick of state - swapping between qubits @xmath22 and @xmath23 is employed to transform the input state @xmath42 to @xmath43 . then with a definite polarization state , unitary rotations to a single location qubit can be realized by an operation of controlled - rotation ( polarization controls location ) , which can be implemented by only using one polarization beam splitter ( pbs ) and several properly oriented half - wavelength plates ( hwp ) .",
    "after the state - swapping , we can begin to construct the two parts of our network : preparation and cloning .",
    "after having finished this work , we may have a complicated construction ( composed of many universal logic gates ) of such a cloning machine with optical deveces .",
    "but by techniques of compiling@xcite , the network can be significantly simplified and a feasible setup is shown in figure 1 .",
    "now let s explain the experiment setup ( figure 1 ) in detail .",
    "the performance of this cloning machine is demonstrated by using a laser beam attenuated to the single - photon level as input source . at the output , the photons",
    "are detected using geigermode avalanche photodiodes  single photon counting modules ( @xmath44-@xmath45 , eg&g # spcm - aq , efficiency @xmath46 , dark count @xmath47 ) . in our experiment ,",
    "a well polarized light beam is created by a he - ne laser with a brewster window ( melles griot , @xmath48 @xmath49 ) and its polarization degree is improved by a polarizer .",
    "then a pbs follows , and its vertical output is measured by a power meter @xmath50 to confirm the stability of the laser s power during the experiment .",
    "the horizontal output of this pbs is greatly attenuated ( by an attenuating plate , attn ) so that the maximum detection rates are always less than @xmath51 ; for the setup passage time of @xmath52 @xmath53 , this means that on average fewer than @xmath54 photons are in the setup at any time .",
    "now the input source can be viewed as single - photon source@xcite .",
    "after that the to - be - cloned state is prepared by a properly oriented hwp and an adjustable waveplate ( ajwp , namely , a pockels cell ) .    to confirm the correct result , in a general way , quantum state tomography@xcite at the output end is required , and a simple version by optical interference is considered in the present system .",
    "another auxiliary qubit is utilized to determine the reduced density operators of the two replicas respectively .",
    "this auxiliary qubit ( qubit _ aux _ ) is introduced as @xmath55 by four @xmath56 bses .",
    "then a controlled state swapping is performed with qubit _ aux _ as the controller : if qubit _ aux is _",
    "@xmath57 , the states of qubits @xmath58 and @xmath23 interchange , or else they remain unchanged .",
    "the four paths with qubit _ aux _ as @xmath59 determine the density operator of qubit @xmath22 ( polarization ) : if the relative photon counts and the polarization state of path @xmath60 is @xmath61 and @xmath62 respectively ( by measuring four linearly independent states of the polarization qubit : @xmath63 latexmath:[$%    determine each component of the matrix @xmath62 , here @xmath65 @xmath66,and this method is called quantum tomography@xcite ) , the density operator of qubit @xmath22 can be written as @xmath67 .",
    "other four paths determine the density operator of qubit @xmath23 ( location ) which has been swapped to the polarization qubit with _ aux _ as @xmath68 , and the method of measurement is the same as above .",
    "then the reduced density operators of the replicas provide the evaluation of the fidelities , which are shown in figure 2 .",
    "we can see that the experiment datas coincide with the theoretical value @xmath0 quite well .",
    "before qubit @xmath23 is under verification , it has been swapped with the polarization one , so errors of both qubits fidelities can be analyzed in similar ways .",
    "now we will analyze the error of our experiment .",
    "the error of the fidelity @xmath69 originates mainly from two ways :    \\1 .",
    "the oscillation of the photon counts of pass @xmath60 ( denoted by @xmath70 ) , which is primarily caused by the small oscillation of the reflexivity and transmissivity of the first hwp ( in the stage of state preparation ) for different polarization states .",
    "the precision limits of the waveplates and polarizers orientation angles ( denoted by @xmath71 ) .",
    "it can be deduced that an upper bound of the maximum error of @xmath69 can be expressed as@xcite @xmath72 . in the present system ,",
    "@xmath73 @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) and @xmath76 .",
    "thus we get the maximum error of @xmath69 as @xmath77 , which has been embodied in the result figure as error bars .",
    "a more complicated network can be designed to carry out the @xmath78 cloning , whose principle has been generalized from the @xmath19 cloning@xcite .",
    "but in the present scheme , qubits are represented by different freedom degrees of a single photon , and about @xmath79 optical elements are needed to represent @xmath80 qubits@xcite .",
    "so the complexity of the network will increase exponentially with the increase of @xmath1 and @xmath7 , and this is a shortcoming of the present method .    in the present experiment ,",
    "qubits are represented by different freedom degrees of a single photon . with a quantum non - demolition ( qnd )",
    "measurement@xcite , the information of the location qubit may be extracted without destroying the polarization qubit , in principle .",
    "figure 1 is the setup of the universal quantum cloning machine .",
    "the inset is the logic circuit ( @xmath81 and @xmath82 denote the controller and target of a cnot operation respectively , @xmath83 is a rotation to a single qubit ) .",
    "we represent the three input qubits by three freedom degrees of a single photon .",
    "qubit @xmath22 ( to - be - cloned polarization qubit ) is introduced by setting the photons initial polarization in an arbitrary state @xmath84 @xmath85 .",
    "qubits @xmath23 and @xmath38 are both location qubits , which are introduced by different choices of `` beam paths '' with the initial state @xmath86 . by the state - swapping , qubit @xmath23 is transformed to @xmath87 , while qubit @xmath22 is transformed to @xmath88 . in the stage of entanglement preparation , qubits @xmath22 and @xmath38 are prepared into @xmath89 .",
    "then several cnot operations follow to accomplish the cloning , which can be compiled to two independent polarization m - z interferometers .",
    "quantum state tomography is adopted to confirm the correct result .",
    "another auxiliary qubit enables us to measure the density operators of the replicas separately , which is introduced as @xmath90 by arranging four @xmath91_-_@xmath91 bses in each potential paths of the output photon .",
    "then a controlled state swapping is carried out and the four qubits ( qubit @xmath92 @xmath93 @xmath38 and @xmath94 ) evolve to the state @xmath95 @xmath96 . when the qubit @xmath94 is @xmath97 , the density operator of replica qubit @xmath22 _  _ ( polarization ) can be obtained by detectors @xmath22 to @xmath98 ( @xmath99_-_@xmath100 ) and corresponding quwps and polarizers , by measuring the mixed state of polarization and relative photon counts of each path . to the other four outputs of the bses where the qubit @xmath94 is @xmath101 , a state - swapping between qubits @xmath22 and @xmath23",
    "is performed so that the density operator of replica qubit @xmath23 is exactly realized by knowing that of the interchanged polarization qubit , which is measured by @xmath102_-_@xmath103 and corresponding quwps and polarizers .",
    "figure 2 is the replicas fidelities in the optimal universal cloning machine .",
    "the fidelity is defined as @xmath104 with @xmath5 denoting the density operator of a replica .",
    "this machine can deal with any state @xmath105 equally well . from down to up , the four subfigures represent the cases @xmath106 , respectively . in each subfigure ,",
    "the state angle @xmath107 of the to - be - cloned qubit varies from @xmath108 to @xmath109 , the dotted lines represent the theoretical optimal fidelities @xmath0 @xmath110 , while the crosses @xmath111 denote the fidelities of the output qubit @xmath22 and the triangles @xmath112 denote the fidelities of qubit @xmath23 .",
    "as is shown , all the fidelities are close to the theoretical value @xmath0 , and errors have been analyzed in section iii .",
    "we have realized a one - to - two qubits buek - hillery cloning machine with linear optical devices .",
    "we showed that , the fidelities between the two output qubits and the original qubit are both @xmath0 for arbitrary input pure states .",
    "considering the output state of the polarization qubit as @xmath114 , the fidelity is calculated by @xmath115 .",
    "let @xmath116 , where @xmath117 $ ] .",
    "it is easy to prove that @xmath118 , and the error of @xmath69 can be expressed as @xmath119 .",
    "then the maximum error may be written as @xmath120 , for @xmath121 and @xmath122 is the orientation precision ."
