    "pulsars are universally accepted as fast rotating neutron stars with very a strong magnetic field ( @xmath0-@xmath1 g ) , which is predominantly dipolar .",
    "their radio emission is thought to be curvature emission from relativistic plasma streaming out along the open field lines of a dipole whose foot points on the neutron star surface define the polar cap @xcite .",
    "the simplistic picture of pulsar radio emission that we can gather from the polar cap emission models is as follows .",
    "the rotationally induced , very strong electric field component parallel to the magnetic field pulls out the primary plasma from the neutron star surface and accelerates it to very high energies with a lorentz factor of @xmath2-@xmath3 these ultrarelativistic primary particles emit @xmath4-ray photons through curvature and synchrotron radiations , which in turn produce the secondary electron - positron ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) pair plasma by their interaction with a strong magnetic field .",
    "the secondary plasma further undergoes the pair cascade process and develops into a high density plasma of @xmath7 once the density of pair plasma becomes comparable to the goldreich - julian charge density , it shields the parallel electric field component @xcite .",
    "hence , the plasma motion becomes `` force free '' along the field lines and emits curvature radiation due to the curvature of the field lines .",
    "since the brightness temperature of the pulsar radio emission is very high ( @xmath8-@xmath9 k ) , the emission is believed to be coherent emission from plasma .",
    "pulsars show a high degree of linear polarization with a systematic `` s''- shaped polarization position angle ( ppa ) swing , which is a characteristic property of pulsar signals",
    ". the `` rotating - vector - model '' ( rvm ) of @xcite attributes this characteristic `` s '' curve to an underlying geometry , wherein the magnetic field is assumed to be mainly dipolar , and relativistic beaming is in the direction of field line tangents .",
    "ever since the success of rvm , the fitting of pulsar polarization angle profiles to the model has been attempted to constrain the underlying emission geometry , such as the magnetic axis inclination angle with respect to the rotation axis and the sight line impact angle with respect to the magnetic axis . however , some pulsars show that the polarization angle behavior deviates from the standard `` s '' curve , particularly in millisecond pulsars , where the polarization sweep is noisy and on average flatter @xcite .",
    "several relativistic and plasma effects have been proposed to understand these deviations : plasma propagation effects @xcite , aberration of the beaming direction from strict parallelism @xcite , distortion of the underlying dipole field due to the field aligned polar cap current ( pc - current * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or multiple interacting orthogonal polarization modes @xcite .",
    "phenomenologically , pulsar emission is recognized as a central `` core '' arising from a region near the magnetic pole and surrounding `` cones '' from concentric rings around the pole ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , due to an asymmetry in the phase location of the components , there are some contrary arguments that the emission is `` patchy '' @xcite .",
    "pulsars also show an asymmetry in the strength of the components intensity between the leading and trailing sides .",
    "the asymmetry observed both in the strength and the phase location of the components has been attributed to the effects of rotation such as aberration and retardation ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "due to the rotationally induced aberration and asymmetry in the curvature of the source trajectory , the inflection point of the ppa profile lags the peak of the central intensity component ( core ) @xcite , and the leading side components become stronger and broader than the corresponding ones on the trailing side @xcite .    in general",
    ", circular polarization is common in pulsar emission , but diverse in nature @xcite .",
    "the research related to its origin is still of great importance from the point of view of the emission mechanism .",
    "there are two types of models for the origin of the circular polarization : intrinsic to the emission mechanism ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and generated by the propagation effects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "only the `` antisymmetric''-type circular polarization was thought to be an intrinsic property of curvature radiation .",
    "very recently , @xcite have shown that the `` symmetric''-type circular polarization ( where the circular sign remains the same throughout a component or pulse ) is also possible within the framework of the curvature radiation , which takes into account the pulsar rotation and modulation ( nonuniform plasma distribution ) .",
    "they have made an attempt to simulate the diverse behavior of polarization properties of pulsar radio emission by developing a relativistic model on full polarization of curvature radiation .    since the polarization behavior of pulsars",
    "is believed to depend upon the underlying geometry of the emission region , any perturbation to the dipole field is expected to be reflected in the polarization profiles .",
    "the induced toroidal magnetic field due to field - aligned , poloidal currents above the polar cap perturbs the dipole field and it is quite significant in affecting the ppa @xcite and introduces a phase shift into the intensity components @xcite .",
    "it is shown that the pc - current can only introduce an offset into the ppa swing , but there is no significant phase shift into the inflection point .",
    "the full polarization model that describes all the polarization parameters of radio emission in the pc - current perturbed dipole magnetic field does not exist .",
    "so , in an attempt to understand the pc - current - induced perturbation on the pulsar radio emission and polarization , we develop a complete polarization model by taking into account only the pc - currents .",
    "we derive the viewing geometry for the perturbed dipole field in section 2 . in section 3",
    ", we present the simulation of typical polarization profiles for the cases of uniform and nonuniform distribution of radiation sources . in section 4",
    "we provide the discussion , and in section 5 the conclusion .",
    "in spherical polar coordinates @xmath10 centered on the magnetic axis , the unperturbed dipole field is given as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the magnetic moment , @xmath13 is the magnetic colatitude , and @xmath14 is the radial distance from the origin .",
    "most of the polar cap models of pulsar emission include a current of relativistic charged particles streaming out along the open field lines , which is approximately equal to the goldreich ",
    "julian charge density ( @xmath15 ) , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a scale factor of order unity , reflecting our ignorance of the actual current , and @xmath18 is the pulsar angular velocity . for simplicity",
    ", we treat @xmath19 to be a constant quantity throughout this work .    by assuming a small polar cap so that the variation in @xmath20 across the polar cap is also small , and that @xmath21 is a point dipole with an axisymmetric current flow , the induced magnetic field due to the field aligned current is given as @xcite @xmath22 which is purely toroidal and axisymmetric with respect to the magnetic axis , i.e. , independent of the magnetic azimuth @xmath23 .",
    "the angle @xmath24 is the magnetic axis inclination angle , and @xmath25 is the light cylinder radius , where @xmath26 is the speed of light and @xmath27 is the pulsar rotation period . then the perturbed dipole field",
    "@xmath28 with @xmath29 is also axisymmetric with respect to the magnetic axis .",
    "the differential equations for the magnetic field lines are @xmath30 where @xmath31 are the respective @xmath32 components of @xmath33 in polar coordinates . substituting the expressions for @xmath31 into equation ( [ eqn : diff ] )",
    "yields the following three differential equations for the magnetic field lines : @xmath34 @xmath35 and @xmath36 since equation ( [ eqn : diff3 ] ) can be deduced from equations ( [ eqn : diff1 ] ) and ( [ eqn : diff2 ] ) , magnetic field lines can be defined uniquely by the earlier two equations .",
    "integration of equation ( [ eqn : diff1 ] ) gives @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the integration constant .",
    "using @xmath39 the field line constant at @xmath40 we obtain @xmath41 then equation ( [ eqn : r1 ] ) becomes @xmath42 substitution of equation ( [ eqn : r2 ] ) into equation ( [ eqn : diff2 ] ) and integration gives @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the integration constant . using @xmath45 at @xmath46 we obtain @xmath47 , where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the initial colatitude and azimuth , respectively . by substituting @xmath44 into equation ( [ eqn : phi1 ] )",
    "we get @xmath50 the position vector @xmath51 of an arbitrary point @xmath52 on a perturbed dipolar field line is given by equation ( 1 ) of @xcite , where the parameter @xmath23 has to be replaced by the expression that we have given in equation ( [ eqn : phi ] ) . by using @xmath53 rotation phase @xmath54 @xmath55 @xmath56  s , @xmath57 @xmath58 @xmath49 from @xmath59 to @xmath60 in steps of @xmath61 , and @xmath14 from @xmath62 to @xmath63 we have traced the field lines and presented them in figure [ fig : figure1 ] . dashed line curves represent the field lines of an actual dipole while the solid line curves represent those of the perturbed dipole .",
    "pc - currents induce the toroidal component of the magnetic field , and hence there is an azimuthal twist in the field lines of the perturbed field with respect to the magnetic axis .",
    "the curvature of the perturbed dipolar field line is given by @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the arc length of the field line , @xmath66 and @xmath67 is the field line tangent .",

    "we define the emission point coordinates : magnetic colatitude and azimuth of the emission points within the beaming region as @xmath93 and @xmath94 respectively , wherein at the center of the beaming region @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",

    "but the angle @xmath104 between @xmath102 and @xmath82 is given by @xmath105 for an exact alignment of @xmath82 and @xmath103 at the beaming region center , @xmath106 which implies @xmath107 hence we have @xmath108 next , by solving @xmath109 , we obtain @xmath110 and @xmath111 in figure [ fig : figure2 ] we have plotted the emission coordinates @xmath112 of the beaming region center and the corresponding radius of curvature @xmath113 of the source trajectory at those points as functions of the rotation phase .",
    "we chose the parameters @xmath114 , @xmath115 , the emission altitude @xmath116 , @xmath56 s , and @xmath117 .",
    "the dotted line curves are for the parameters in the case of an unperturbed dipole , and the solid line curves represent those in the perturbed case .",
    "the colatitude @xmath118 is found to remain unaffected , whereas there is an upward vertical shift in azimuth @xmath119 due to the induced toroidal magnetic field . therefore at any rotation phase the radiation aberrated in the direction opposite to the direction of the pulsar rotation for positive @xmath86 ( i.e. , for @xmath120 ) , whereas for negative @xmath86 ( i.e. , for @xmath121 ) it is aberrated in the direction of the pulsar rotation . in other words , emission locations in @xmath23 get shifted to later phases with respect to those due to the unperturbed dipole for positive @xmath86 , whereas for negative @xmath86 they get shifted to earlier phases ( the phase shift of an antisymmetric point of @xmath122 with respect to @xmath123 is indicated by the longer arrows ) .",
    "note that the inflection point of @xmath122 ( the phase at which the @xmath122 curve has a maximum slope ) is found to remain unaffected as indicated by the shorter arrows .",
    "since the effect of the induced toroidal component of the magnetic field due to pc - currents is just a twist of the field lines around the magnetic axis and is the same on both the leading and trailing sides , @xmath113 in the perturbed configuration will remain almost symmetric with respect to the phase @xmath124 similar to that in the unperturbed one but with smaller values because of an induced curvature .",
    "next at @xmath125 , we solve @xmath126 and find the allowed range of @xmath101 : @xmath127 and hence deduce the allowed range of @xmath13 from equation ( [ eqn : theta ] ) .",

    "we note that the behavior of the beaming regions with respect to rotation phase @xmath81 is mostly similar to the case of the unperturbed dipole of the non - rotating magnetosphere @xcite .",
    "note that the whole beaming regions of the perturbed dipole get shifted in the coordinate @xmath23 with respect to those of the unperturbed dipole ( see figure [ fig : figure2 ] ) .",
    "the spectral distribution of the radiation field emitted by accelerating relativistic plasma at the observation point @xmath131 is given by @xcite @xmath132}{\\xi^{2 } } e^{i \\omega (    t-\\hat{n}\\cdot \\textbf{r}/c ) } d\\theta .",
    "\\label{eqn : ew}\\ ] ] note that the time @xmath133 in the above equation has to be replaced by the expression given in equation ( 6 ) of kumar & gangadhara ( 2012 ) . following the method given in kumar & gangadhara ( 2012 )",
    ", we solve the integral of equation ( [ eqn : ew ] ) and estimate the polarization state of the radiation field in terms of the stokes parameters @xmath134 @xmath135 @xmath136 and @xmath137 which are defined in @xcite .      by assuming a uniform radiation source distribution in the emission region of the magnetosphere",
    ", we estimated the polarization state of the emitted radiation .",
    "the simulated contour plots of total intensity @xmath138 , linear polarization @xmath139 , and circular polarization @xmath140 in the perturbed dipole configuration are given in figure [ fig : figure3 ] .",

    "the polarized emissions from the beaming region get rotated as indicated by the contour patterns in the @xmath145-plane compared to those due to the unperturbed dipole ( see figure 3 of * ? ? ?",
    "the rotation of the contour patterns is due to the perturbation of the actual dipole geometry by the pc - currents .",
    "also it introduces an asymmetry into the beaming region emissions in such a way that there is a selective enhancement of emissions over larger the @xmath13 and larger @xmath23 regions due to a larger resultant curvature .",
    "this is very clear from the @xmath140 parameter contour plots where there is a selective enhancement of the positive circular over the negative circular .",
    "note that the direction of the rotation of contour patterns in the @xmath145-plane is opposite between the positive and negative @xmath86 cases .",
    "it is in opposite direction to the one with a rotating dipole for positive @xmath86 while for negative @xmath86 it is in the same direction ( see * ? ? ?",
    "also note that the magnitude of the rotation of intensity patterns is found to be independent of the rotation phase of the magnetic axis unlike the one other due to the effect of the pulsar rotation where it noticeably decreases at outer phases .    the net emission that the observer receives at any instant of time will be an incoherent superposition of emissions from different plasma particles / bunches .",
    "following @xcite , we have simulated the polarization profiles : total intensity @xmath146 linear polarization @xmath147 circular polarization @xmath148 and polarization position angle @xmath149 and plotted them in figure [ fig : figure4 ] . for simulation",
    ", we used the same parameters as in figure [ fig : figure3 ] and assumed that the source distribution is uniform throughout the emission region .",
    "the emission on the leading side ( @xmath150 ) is roughly the same as that on the railing side ( @xmath151 ) due to the symmetry of curvature of field lines on both the sides ( see figure [ fig : figure2 ] ) , which is the same as in the unperturbed dipole geometry .",
    "even though emissions from individual sources are highly polarized , the net emission from the whole beaming region becomes less polarized due to the incoherent addition .",
    "however a small quantity of positive circular polarization survives due to the asymmetry in the magnitudes of positive and negative polarities ( see figure [ fig : figure3 ] ) which becomes more significant when the source distribution becomes nonuniform .",
    "the ppa curves ( solid line curves ) shift upward with respect to those due to the unperturbed rvm model ( dotted line curves ) only , but the ppa inflection point is left mostly unchanged . for comparison , ppas derived by @xcite are also superposed with our simulations and both are in good agreement ( see the dashed line curves ) . note that @xcite considered the emission from the beaming region center only , and",
    "the simulations show that the contributions from the neighboring emission points will have the least effect on the net ppa .",
    "however they become important once there is a density gradient in the plasma distribution as we show later .",
    "the sub - pulses in the pulsar individual pulses suggest that the emission region of the pulsar magnetosphere may not be filled with a uniform plasma density .",
    "when the observer s sight line encounters plasma columns which are associated with the sparks activity on the polar cap , components such as features in intensity can result .",
    "hence the net emission that the observer receives will be modulated emission over the uniform background emission .",
    "we model the nonuniform source distribution in the emission region in terms of `` modulation '' function as considered in kumar & gangadhara ( 2012 ) .",
    "the intensity components of average profiles are assumed to be nearly gaussian in shape , and hence they have been fitted with an appropriate gaussian ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we define the modulation function as @xmath152 where @xmath153 is the amplitude , and @xmath154 $ ] and @xmath155 $ ] are the gaussian modulations in @xmath13 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "the parameters @xmath156 define the peak location of the gaussian and @xmath157 and @xmath158 , where @xmath159 and @xmath160 are the corresponding fwhm of the gaussian in the two directions .      by considering a modulation in the magnetic azimuthal direction that has a peak location in the magnetic meridional plane in two cases @xmath161 for @xmath162 and @xmath163 for @xmath164 we computed the polarization profiles and shown them in figures [ fig : figure5 ] and [ fig : figure6 ] , respectively .",
    "for the simulation we used the parameters @xmath165 , @xmath166 , and other parameters that are the same as in figure [ fig : figure3 ] . in the case of @xmath162 ( see figure [ fig : figure5 ] ) , the intensity peak shifted to a later phase whereas for @xmath167 it gets shifted to an earlier phase ( see figure [ fig : figure6 ] ) . due to the perturbation of the magnetic field ,",
    "the emission locations are shifted in the magnetic azimuth as shown in figure [ fig : figure2 ] , and hence , the intensity gets phase shifted to the later and earlier phases for the positive and negative @xmath86 sight lines , respectively .",
    "the phase shifts of the intensity peaks in the case of @xmath168 @xmath169 and @xmath170 are found to be @xmath171 and @xmath172 respectively , whereas those in the case of @xmath173 @xmath169 and @xmath174 are found to be @xmath175 and @xmath176 respectively .",
    "the increase in the phase shift of intensity peaks with increasing @xmath177 can be explained as follows . in the perturbed dipole geometry ,",
    "the emission locations ( particularly in the magnetic azimuth ) get phase shifted with respect to the unperturbed one . because of this phase shift , the curvature of the source trajectory becomes asymmetric about the antisymmetric point of the magnetic azimuth .",
    "for @xmath162 the curvature becomes larger on the trailing side of @xmath178 compared to that on the leading side , whereas it is vice versa about @xmath163 for @xmath167 ( see figure [ fig : figure2 ] ) .",
    "therefore the phase shift of the modulated intensity peaks will be larger than @xmath179 ( where the modulation peak is located ) , and this extra phase shift becomes larger for the broader modulation .",
    "furthermore , the intensity component gets broader as well as shifted further in the negative @xmath86 as the modulation mapped on to broader region in observer s frame compared to that in the positive @xmath86 ( see the case of @xmath169 in figures [ fig : figure5 ] and [ fig : figure6 ] ) .",
    "circular polarization @xmath180 is antisymmetric for the steeper modulation ( @xmath169 ) , and changes sign from negative to positive in the case of @xmath162 and from positive to negative in the case of @xmath167 . in both cases ( @xmath181 ) , the positive circular becomes stronger compared to the negative circular due to an enhancement of the unmodulated positive circular over the negative circular ( see figure [ fig : figure3 ] ) .",
    "also the phase location of the sign reversal of the circular either leads or lags the intensity peak due to the above said asymmetry . in the case of broader modulation ( @xmath182 and @xmath174 ) , the circular becomes almost positive throughout the pulse .",
    "hence it becomes almost symmetric as the effect of the modulation becomes less significant over the beaming regions in comparison with the induced asymmetry between the unmodulated positive and negative circulars that resulted from pc - currents .",
    "linear polarization @xmath183 almost follows the total intensity @xmath184 profile with a lower magnitude due to an incoherent addition of emissions within the beaming region .",
    "further , it is slightly enhanced on the leading side where the circular is smaller than on the trailing side in the case of @xmath168 and vice versa in the case of @xmath167 .",
    "ppa is increasing ( `` counter clockwise '' or `` ccw '' swing as @xmath185 ) in the case of @xmath162 , while decreasing ( `` clockwise '' or `` cw '' swing as @xmath186 ) for @xmath187 hence , in the case of pulsars with antisymmetric - type circular polarization we find the correlation of the sense reversal of circular polarization from negative to positive with the increasing ppa and vice versa .",
    "the inflection point of ppa is mostly unaffected for the broader modulation , similar to the one with an unmodulated emission ( see figure [ fig : figure4 ] ) .",
    "but for a steeper modulation ( @xmath169 ) , it is shifted to the earlier phase in the case of @xmath162 and to the later phase in the case of @xmath173 which is opposite of the intensity phase shifts .",
    "note that the phase shift of the ppa inflection is found to be shifted toward the stronger @xmath183 side .",
    "the phase shifts of the ppa inflection point in the cases of @xmath181 with @xmath169 are found to be @xmath188 and @xmath189 respectively .",
    "the smaller phase shift of the ppa inflection point in the case of @xmath173 as compared to that in the case of @xmath168 is due to effective broadening of the modulation in the observer s frame .",
    "for the next case we consider the modulation symmetrically located on either side with respect to the meridional plane : @xmath190 for @xmath167 and @xmath191 for @xmath162 .",
    "the simulated polarization profiles are shown in figure [ fig : figure7 ] . the modulation strength @xmath192 that the observer finds at the beaming region center and the corresponding radius of curvature @xmath113 of the particle s trajectory are also given .",
    "even though @xmath113 is roughly symmetric at about @xmath193",
    "it becomes asymmetric in strength at the modulation peaks between the leading and trailing sides .",
    "the @xmath113 at the modulation peak on the leading side becomes smaller than that on the trailing side in the case of @xmath167 , and vice versa in the case of @xmath194 this is due to the phase shift of the modulation peaks ( the mid point of the modulation peaks is indicated by the thick arrows ) from the phase shift of the emission points ( see figure [ fig : figure2 ] ) . as a result ,",
    "an asymmetry arises in the strength of the intensity components between the leading and the trailing sides : the component on the leading side becomes stronger than that on the trailing side in the case of @xmath167 and vice versa in the case of @xmath162 . also , since @xmath113 at the modulation peak on leading side becomes less steep than that on the trailing side in the case of @xmath167 , the leading component becomes broader , and vice versa in the case of @xmath162 as indicated by the second row panels . in both",
    "the cases of @xmath86 , similar to the modulation , the outer phase emissions become stronger than the inner ones , and @xmath180 clearly shows that .",
    "however the larger asymmetry between the positive and negative circulars under the leading side component in the @xmath167 case and that under the trailing one in the @xmath162 case is due to the selective enhancement of the positive circular of the unmodulated emissions ( see figure [ fig : figure3 ] ) .      by assuming a hallow cone modulation around the magnetic axis , i.e. , a plasma density gradient only in the polar direction",
    ", we simulated the polarization profiles , which are shown in figures [ fig : figure8 ] and [ fig : figure9 ] .",
    "the parameters used for the simulation are @xmath165 , @xmath195 , and the rest are the same as in figure [ fig : figure3 ] . in the cases of @xmath196 and @xmath197 and @xmath198 since the minimum of @xmath199 the observer sight line just grazes the hallow emission cone and hence a single intensity component is observed .",
    "but in the case of @xmath200 and @xmath201 the observer sight line cuts the hallow cone twice and hence results in double components . in all cases , the intensity peak ( the @xmath184 peak in the cases of @xmath196 and @xmath202 and @xmath203 and the mid point of the intensity peaks in the case of @xmath200 and @xmath201 ) more or less remains at @xmath144",
    "this is because , even with the perturbation of the dipole , both the colatitude and the corresponding radius of curvature remain symmetric about @xmath204 however there is a small phase shift of the ppa inflection point in the cases of @xmath196 and @xmath205 and @xmath200 and @xmath206 but the shift is in the opposite direction between the @xmath181 cases .    in the case of @xmath196 and @xmath202",
    "a tiny circular survives due to a less steep modulation , but in the cases of @xmath196 and @xmath205 and @xmath200 and @xmath201 it is quite significant . in the case of @xmath196 and @xmath207 where the observer sight line grazes the modulation at a larger colatitude , a symmetric - type negative circular",
    "is observed due to the selective enhancement of beaming region emissions over the smaller @xmath13 part ( see figure [ fig : figure3 ] ) .",
    "but in the case of @xmath200 and @xmath206 an antisymmetric - type circular is observed with the sign changing from negative to positive under the leading component and vice versa on trailing .",
    "this is due to the selective enhancement of emissions over either smaller values of @xmath13 or larger depending upon when the sight line crosses the hallow cone .",
    "note that with the modulation in @xmath208 the sign reversal of the circular is the same for both cases of @xmath86 unlike the case with modulation in @xmath23 ( see figures [ fig : figure5 ] and [ fig : figure6 ] ) . since the beaming region emission , due to the uniform source distribution , has a larger positive circular than the negative circular ( see figure [ fig : figure3 ] ) ,",
    "modulated profiles also show a slightly larger positive circular than the negative circular .",
    "in general , the plasma distribution can be nonuniform in both the polar and azimuthal directions and hence we consider the modulation in both @xmath13 and @xmath23 . the extreme cases of modulation : modulation in @xmath23 dominating over that in @xmath13 for @xmath209 and the modulation in @xmath13 dominating over that in @xmath23 for @xmath210 are detailed in sections @xmath211 and @xmath212 respectively .",
    "the simulations with the combinations of modulation parameters used in the sections @xmath211 and @xmath213 give the general polarization profiles .",
    "for the case with the gaussian modulation , with peaks located symmetrically on either sides of the magnetic meridional plane in the conal ring of colatitude @xmath214 , we consider two sets of azimuthal peak locations at @xmath215 and @xmath216 the simulated polarization profiles are given in figure [ fig : figure10 ] for the case of @xmath162 .",
    "for simulation we used @xmath165 , @xmath217 @xmath218 and the other parameters are the same as in figure [ fig : figure3 ] .",
    "since the phase shift of the emission points from the pc - current is only in @xmath23 and not in @xmath208 the observer sight line selectively encounters the modulation depending upon their azimuthal locations as shown in figure [ fig : figure10 ] .",
    "the sight line encounters a stronger modulation on the leading side as it passes closer to the gaussian peak than that on the trailing side in the case @xmath219 and vice versa in the case @xmath220 however , the asymmetry in the strength of the components between the leading and trailing sides becomes enhanced or reduced in the intensity profiles depending upon the asymmetry in the curvature at the modulation peaks as explained earlier for figure [ fig : figure7 ] .",
    "the @xmath113 at the modulation peak on the leading side becomes larger than that on the trailing side .",
    "hence there is a decrease in the asymmetry in the strengths of the modulated intensity components between the leading and trailing sides in the case of @xmath219 whereas it increases in the case of @xmath220 the inner circulars become stronger than the outer ones in the case of @xmath215 as the observer selectively encounters the modulated regions that are closer to the magnetic meridional plane , and vice versa in the case of @xmath220 further , it is more pronounced on the trailing side than that on the leading side due to an asymmetry in the modulation encountered by the observer .    note that if one considers the modulation in the @xmath208 direction which is even steeper , then the circular becomes an almost symmetric type with the sign of inner circulars for @xmath219 and only the outer circulars sign for @xmath220 also note that if one chooses negative sight line @xmath167 and the modulation peaks are situated symmetrically in the azimuthal direction with respect to the meridional plane , then the behavior of the strength of the modulation that the sight line encounters and intensity components on the leading and trailing sides will be opposite to the case of @xmath194      so far we have considered the emissions from the northern hemisphere of the pulsar magnetosphere , which lies toward the positive @xmath221 however one can receive emissions from the southern hemisphere that lies toward the negative @xmath222 by considering @xmath223 and the azimuthal nonuniform source distribution , we have simulated the polarization profiles for the emission from the southern hemisphere for the two cases of @xmath224 and @xmath225 the simulated profiles are given in figure [ fig : figure11 ] .",
    "the simulations show that the emission from the southern hemisphere for the case of @xmath224 is similar to the case of @xmath169 of figure [ fig : figure5 ] , except with the opposite sign of circular polarization and opposite ppa swing .",
    "similarly , the emission in the case @xmath226 is similar to that in the case @xmath169 of figure [ fig : figure6 ] .",
    "note that this behavior remains the same even with the nonuniform source distribution in both the polar and azimuthal directions that we have considered in the case of figure [ fig : figure10 ] .",
    "the pc - current - perturbed dipole field is axisymmetric with respect to the magnetic axis wherein the field lines are twisted around the magnetic axis due to an azimuthal component .",
    "since the plasma particles ( or bunches ) are constrained to move along the field lines , the beaming direction of the relativistic emission gets aberrated toward the direction of a tangent of twisted field lines . as a result , for the case of positive @xmath86 sight line ,",
    "the emission points of the perturbed dipole field are shifted to later phases ( or later times ) in the magnetic azimuth than those of the unperturbed dipole field , and vice versa for the case of the negative @xmath86 sight line .",
    "since the induced twist of field lines is around the magnetic axis only , the emission points are found to be more or less unaffected in the magnetic colatitude . as the perturbed dipole field remains axisymmetric , for a given field line constant @xmath227",
    "the radius of the curvature of the perturbed dipole field lines becomes a function of colatitude only .",
    "hence the curvature remains symmetric about @xmath193 which is similar to the magnetic colatitude .",
    "therefore the emission due to the uniform radiation source distribution and its polarization profiles remain symmetric about @xmath123 as shown in figure [ fig : figure4 ] , which is similar to the emission in the unperturbed dipole field , except for the survival of a small circular polarization due to a pc - current - induced asymmetry .",
    "however , due to the nonuniform source distribution with a density gradient effectively in the magnetic azimuth , the modulated intensity components get shifted in the phase .",
    "since the phase shift of the magnetic azimuth between the two cases @xmath228 is of opposite directions , the modulated intensity components shift to the later phase in the case of positive @xmath86 and to the earlier phase in the case of negative @xmath229 even though the radius of curvature @xmath113 is symmetric about @xmath193 it becomes asymmetric about the shifted modulation peak where the observer encounters the maximum plasma density .",
    "hence the phase shift of modulated intensity components becomes significantly different from that of the peak location of the broader modulation .",
    "but the intensity components do not get shifted in phase if the modulation is effective only in the polar direction as both @xmath13 and @xmath113 remain symmetric about @xmath230    @xcite have shown that due to the distortion of the underlying dipole field , the resultant ppa curve gets an upward shift in the ppa versus rotation phase diagram , but the inflection point remains roughly unchanged .",
    "our simulations do confirm the results of @xcite in the case of unmodulated emission .",
    "however , once the radiation source distribution becomes nonuniform with larger density gradient , as we showed in sections @xmath231 the phase shift of the ppa inflection point becomes quite significant .",
    "note that , if there are phase shifts between the intensity components and that of the ppa inflection point then they will be in the opposite directions .",
    "since the phase shift of emission points in the perturbed dipole field occurs only in the magnetic azimuth but not in the colatitude , the observer in general encounters an asymmetry in the strength of the two directional ( polar and azimuthal ) modulations between the leading and trailing sides as shown in figure [ fig : figure10 ] . depending upon the azimuthal peak location of the gaussian modulation in a given cone",
    ", the sight line selectively encounters the modulation either on the leading side or the trailing side .",
    "hence , an asymmetry arises in the strength of the intensity components between the leading and trailing sides .",
    "however , the asymmetry in the intensity profiles could get enhanced or reduced .",
    "this depends upon the asymmetry in the curvature of the source trajectory at the modulation peaks between the two sides , which is induced due to the phase shift of the modulation peaks .",
    "note that , even with modulation only in the azimuthal direction , an asymmetry arises in the strength of the intensity components between the leading and trailing sides as shown in figure [ fig : figure7 ] .",
    "we showed that both the `` antisymmetric '' ( with an asymmetry in the strength between the opposite circular polarization polarities , in general ) and `` symmetric '' types of circular polarization could be observed anywhere within the pulse window .",
    "this is possible due to an induced asymmetry in the polarized emission from the beaming region , such as the asymmetry between the positive and negative polarities , and asymmetry due to the rotation of circular contour patterns in the @xmath145-plane , the modulation of emission due to the non - uniform distribution of sources .",
    "our simulations show that the sign reversal of circular polarization near the central region of the pulse profile from negative to positive is correlated with the increasing ppa ( wherein the ppa curve has a positive slope ) and vice versa .",
    "this behavior is found in many pulsars @xcite and has been confirmed by @xcite , and @xcite . however , there is also an association of the sign reversal of the circular polarization from positive to negative with the increasing ppa and vice versa @xcite . in the case of pulsars with the sign reversal of circular polarization",
    "not associated with the central core region , @xcite have found that both the sign reversals of the circular from negative to positive and from positive to negative are associated with both the increasing and the decreasing ppa , and our simulation of double component pulse profiles confirms this behavior . in pulsars with the symmetric type of circular polarization , we observed no correlation between the sense of circular polarization and the ppa swing .",
    "hence we confirm the findings of @xcite that the positive circular could be associated with either the increasing or decreasing ppa , and similarly negative circular too .",
    "note that @xcite have also confirmed these findings in the emissions from the rotating dipole .",
    "the @xmath232 drift on the spark - associated plasma filaments makes them rotate around the magnetic axis , and serves as a natural and physical mechanism for the sub - pulse drift phenomenon @xcite .",
    "the effects of the @xmath232 drift and the pc - current are similar , in the sense that both of them introduce an azimuthal component of velocity to the plasma in addition to the velocity in the direction of tangents to the dipolar field lines .",
    "the aberration angle @xmath233 @xcite between the unperturbed velocity @xmath234 and the perturbed velocity @xmath235 is given by @xmath236 where @xmath237 and @xmath238 can be used to investigate the significance of one over the other .",
    "for the case of the @xmath232 drift , the perturbed velocity is given by @xmath239 where @xmath240 is the drift velocity around the magnetic axis with @xmath241 being the time taken by the plasma filament to complete one full rotation around the magnetic axis . by considering observationally quoted values for @xmath241 in the literature ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , we find the ratio of @xmath233 due to @xmath242 to that due to the pc - current .",
    "it is @xmath243-@xmath244 for slow drifting pulsars ( e.g. , it is about @xmath245 for psr b0943 + 10 and @xmath244 for psr b2319 + 60 whose @xmath246 and @xmath247 respectively ) and @xmath248-@xmath249 for fast drifting pulsars ( e.g. , it is about @xmath250 for psr b2303 + 30 and @xmath249 for psr b0826@xmath25134 whose @xmath252 and @xmath253 respectively ) . therefore , we believe that the pc - currents are more significant in comparison with the @xmath254 drift in influencing the emission beam geometry and polarization , unless the pulsar drifting is very fast ( i.e. , @xmath255 ) .    in this work , we considered the altitude - independent pc - current density , but in reality it could have an altitude dependency due to the diverging nature of the dipolar field lines and conservation of escaping plasma . since we considered constant emission altitude @xmath14 across the pulse profile ,",
    "our simulations are still valid in explaining the trend of the effect of the pc - current on pulsar polarization profiles . however ,",
    "if one considers the emissions from a range of altitude that increases from inner to outer phases ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , then the altitude dependent current density would be more appropriate .",
    "our aim was to understand the role of the pc - current on pulsar radio emission and polarization , and we did not consider the pulsar rotation here . however , the combined role of pc - currents and the rotation on the pulsar radio emission and polarization needs to be investigated .",
    "by considering the pc - current - induced perturbation on the dipole field we have developed a model for the pulsar radio emission and polarization . by incorporating the nonuniform distribution of radiation sources in the emission region of the distorted dipole field ,",
    "we have simulated a few typical polarization pulse profiles . based on our simulations ,",
    "we conclude the following points .    1 .   due to the pc - current - induced perturbation of the underlying dipole field ,",
    "the emission points in the magnetic azimuth get shifted to later phases in the case of positive @xmath256 and to earlier phases in the case of negative @xmath86 compared to those due to unperturbed ones ( see figure [ fig : figure2 ] ) .",
    "2 .   the intensity components that resulted from the modulation that dominated in the azimuthal direction over that in the polar direction , shift to either later or earlier phases depending upon the viewing geometry .",
    "the magnitude of the phase shift depends upon the steepness of the modulation and the pc - current - induced asymmetry in the curvature of the source trajectory .",
    "3 .   due to the pc - current - induced asymmetry and modulation",
    ", there arises a small phase shift in the ppa inflection point , too .",
    "4 .   the leading side intensity components could become stronger and broader than the corresponding trailing ones or vice versa depending upon the viewing geometry and azimuthal location of the gaussian modulation peaks in the concentric cones .",
    "both the `` antisymmetric''-type circular polarization with usual asymmetry in the strength of the opposite polarities and the `` symmetric''-type circular polarization become possible anywhere within the pulse window .",
    "it depends upon the viewing geometry and modulation in the emission region of the perturbed dipole field ."
