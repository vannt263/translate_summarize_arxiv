    "the suppression of highly energetic particles observed at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) @xcite suggests that the matter created in the first moments after the two heavy ions have collided is a strongly - coupled deconfined plasma of quarks and gluons @xcite .",
    "the degree of thermalization of the soft degrees freedom seems to be consistent with the perfect fluid hypothesis where the strongly - coupled quark - gluon plasma ( sqgp ) has a shear viscosity to entropy density ratio @xcite of the order of the string - inspired lower bound @xmath4 @xcite derived using the anti - de sitter / conformal field theory ( ads / cft ) correspondence @xcite .",
    "this correspondence provides a framework to calculate nonpertubatively observables associated with strongly - coupled @xmath0 supersymmetric yang - mills ( sym ) theories in terms of dual weakly - coupled ( super)gravity .",
    "if the rhic plasma is indeed strongly - coupled , one has to rely on non - perturbative methods , such as ads / cft , to describe its properties . at temperatures sufficiently above the critical temperature , the sqgp appears to display some of the inherent properties of @xmath0 sym plasmas such as conformal invariance .",
    "given the power of ads / cft to compute nonequilibrium dynamical quantities , it is natural to investigate whether jet quenching phenomena can be explained in terms of the dual gravitational concepts of ads / cft .    in this paper",
    "we therefore study the sym analogous of jet quenching , i.e. , the problem of a heavy quark moving through a strongly - coupled @xmath0 sym plasma .",
    "we use the setup proposed in @xcite where an infinitely massive heavy quark moving at a constant speed @xmath5 along the comoving @xmath6 axis in the sym plasma corresponds to one of the endpoints of a classical string that lives in a 5-dimensional space defined by an ads@xmath7-schwarzschild black ( brane ) hole geometry . in this steady - state solution ,",
    "the quark has been moving since @xmath8 and can be found at the origin at @xmath9 .",
    "according to the ads / cft correspondence , the disturbances in the 5-dimensional metric caused by the string can be used to obtain the full non - perturbative result for the energy - momentum tensor of the system plasma+heavy quark at finite temperature @xmath10 . in ref.@xcite , the total energy - momentum tensor of the system",
    "was computed analytically to leading order in an expansion in powers of inverse momentum @xmath11 and then transformed back to coordinate space .",
    "this tensor describes the energy and momentum disturbances induced in the plasma in a spacetime region close to the heavy - quark in the limit where both the thooft coupling constant of the plasma @xmath12 and the number of colors @xmath13 are large .",
    "note that the low - energy excitations found in the linearized analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite , i.e , the sound and diffusion modes , only appear in the opposite limit where @xmath14 @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we compare the analytical result for the stress tensor derived in @xcite with a first - order navier - stokes ansatz for the energy - momentum tensor in order to determine the distance within which the wake left behind by the heavy quark is thermalized ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "to first order in a gradient expansion , the navier - stokes stress tensor is @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the local energy density , @xmath17 is the isotropic pressure , and @xmath18 is the flow 4-vector ( in our metric @xmath19 ) .",
    "the dissipative contribution to the tensor above is given by the shear tensor ( the bulk viscosity of conformal plasmas is identically zero ) @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the local spatial projector and @xmath22 .",
    "note that we kept the nonlinear terms in @xmath23 in the definition of @xmath24 .",
    "the flow velocity associated with the full @xmath25 of @xcite can be obtained by boosting the tensor to its local rest frame ( landau frame ) @xcite . the deviation from navier - stokes hydrodynamics",
    "can then be studied by defining the tensor @xmath26 and checking its components in the landau frame . if @xmath27 ( components evaluated in the landau frame come with the l subscript )",
    "can be described by navier - stokes , we should obtain @xmath28",
    "one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] that the magnitude and structure of the discrepancy between navier - stokes and @xmath25 remains approximately the same for all the components of @xmath29 .",
    "we have set @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath1 . outside the region where @xmath32 ( longitudinal direction ) and @xmath33 ( transverse direction ) , the system can be described by the first - order navier - stokes energy - momentum tensor to an accuracy of roughly @xmath34 . inside that region",
    ", however , the discrepancy quickly increases and eventually diverges . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , one can see that in the region where navier - stokes provides a good description of the system the numerically calculated velocity flow @xmath35 matches the leading order result in @xmath36 , @xmath37 , where @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , in this region the system is more accurately described by a linearized version of the first - order navier - stokes equations .",
    "in this paper we have compared the analytically obtained energy - momentum tensor of an infinitely massive quark moving through a strongly coupled @xmath0 sym plasma with a non - ideal tensor given by the first - order navier - stokes ansatz .",
    "we have found that the energy deposited by the quark is thermalized in the region defined by @xmath40 and @xmath41 , which excludes the nonequilibrium jet head .",
    "in fact , the system can be described by linearized first - order navier stokes hydrodynamics down to distances of roughly @xmath42 .",
    "thus , assuming that a strongly coupled @xmath0 sym plasma can capture the main features of the sqgp , we should expect that the energy deposited by jets induces almost perfect fluid hydrodynamic response of the sqgp outside the head region .",
