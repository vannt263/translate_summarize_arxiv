    "<S> in this paper , we address a crucial point regarding the description of moderate to high reynolds numbers aquatic swimmers . for decades , </S>",
    "<S> swimming animals have been classified in two different families of propulsive mechanisms based on the reynolds number : the `` resistive '' swimmers , using local friction to produce the necessary thrust force for locomotion at low reynolds number and the `` reactive '' swimmers , lying in the high reynolds range , and using added mass acceleration ( described by perfect fluid theory ) </S>",
    "<S> . however , inertial swimmers are also systems that dissipate energy , due to their finite size , therefore involving strong resistive contributions , even for high reynolds numbers . using a complete model for the hydrodynamic forces , involving both reactive and resistive contributions , </S>",
    "<S> we revisit here the physical mechanisms responsible for the thrust production of such swimmers . </S>",
    "<S> we show , for instance , that the resistive part of the force balance is as crucial as added mass effects in the modeling of the thrust force , especially for elongated species . </S>",
    "<S> the conclusions brought by this work may have significant contributions to the understanding of complex swimming mechanisms , especially for the future design of artificial swimmers .    </S>",
    "<S> every fluid dynamicist has opened , at least once , a book addressing the mechanics of swimming . </S>",
    "<S> although the problem has been studied by experimental biologists for almost a century @xcite , and formalised later by the pioneer works of taylor @xcite and lighthill @xcite , it remains a very active field for experimental and theoretical physics and biology ( see e.g. recent reviews by @xcite ) . behind the elegant undulatory kinematics that leads to motion , </S>",
    "<S> it is newton s third law that allows the estimation of the net thrust force produced by the animal . basically , the local force applied by the fluid to the body in reaction to the body movements has two components : a _ resistive _ component due to local friction at the fluid / solid interface and a _ reactive _ ( inertial ) component coming from the amount of fluid accelerated away from the swimmer s body . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of these two contributions has brought scientists to make a distinction between different swimming mechanisms , depending on the animal body size or the nature of the fluid . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , swimmers at small scales are in the low - reynolds domain where viscosity prevails over inertial effects . established a potential flow theory for inertial swimmers ( high reynolds domain ) where viscous contributions are neglected , relying on a slender - body approximation that allows to integrate the _ reactive _ lateral forces along the coordinate following the spinal cord of the fish .     where the function @xmath0 describes its span varying along the longitudinal coordinate , and ( b ) the @xmath1 function describing the undulation of the spinal cord of the fish.[fig_schema_fish ] ]    the existence of these two models has led to a virtual frontier between two groups of swimmers in terms of the reynolds number : the first being based on dissipation </S>",
    "<S> ( small scale swimmers rely on the anisotropy of the friction drag components normal and tangential to each body section ) , and the second , used by large swimmers , based on inertial momentum transfer . in other words </S>",
    "<S> , thrust production would be based in the first case on local transversal _ </S>",
    "<S> velocities _ , and in the second case , on local transversal _ </S>",
    "<S> accelerations_. at low reynolds numbers , </S>",
    "<S> the locomotion problem is fully solved once the expression for the local drag is integrated . on the contrary , in the inertial regime , an additional model for the global drag experienced by the swimmer </S>",
    "<S> is needed to close the locomotion problem    in the present work we propose to use such a local model , involving both reactive and resistive contributions , to revisit the crucial question of the physical mechanism responsible for thrust production in moderate to high reynolds number fish - like swimmers . </S>",
    "<S> the swimmers are characterized through their geometrical aspect ratio @xmath2 defined as @xmath3 , with @xmath4 the total length of the swimmer and @xmath5 the local height as a function of the curvilinear coordinate @xmath6 ( see fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig_schema_fish]-a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the latter will be considered as a constant @xmath7 for the following analysis , where the swimmers are modeled by infinitely thin rectangular foils . </S>",
    "<S> the swimming kinematics is characterized by the deformation of the spinal cord whose local position can be described by the @xmath8 coordinates , dependent of the curvilinear coordinate @xmath6 and time @xmath9 ( see fig . [ fig_schema_fish]-b ) . during the imposed swimming motion , each slice of the swimmer </S>",
    "<S> is subjected to local forces corresponding to both reactive and resistive contributions . </S>",
    "<S> considering the inextensibility of the spinal cord , and using a second - order non - linear approach as in @xcite , the reactive and resistive forces per unit surface can be written as : where @xmath10 represents the local added mass accelerated during swimming , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the unity vectors normal and tangential to the fish surface respectively ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_schema_fish]-b ) and the dot and prime symbols are time and space derivatives , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , @xmath13 is the fluid density and @xmath14 is a drag coefficient weighing the _ non - linear resistive term_. @xmath14 is associated to the dynamic stalls at each swimming cycle that result from the large transversal local velocities and the finite geometry of the fish section . as evoked above </S>",
    "<S> , the consideration of the resistive component to accompany the classical potential flow model is a major point for the description of fish swimming mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> this point will be the core of the forthcoming discussion in this work , where we examine the role of both the acceleration of added mass and the quadratic hydrodynamic resistance in the production of thrust . </S>",
    "<S> the projection of eqs . </S>",
    "<S> [ fma ] and [ fd ] in the swimming direction ( in this case @xmath15 ) gives the contribution of these forces to the thrust . </S>",
    "<S> they read , respectively : in order to compare these two terms for a given swimmer ( defined by its kinematics and aspect ratio ) , the knowledge of both @xmath14 and @xmath10 are needed . </S>",
    "<S> we have estimated the precise value of the added mass coefficient @xmath10 for the present rectangular foils by studying the impulse response of elastic plates of different aspect ratios in water . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath10 is then deduced through the modification of the relaxation frequency of the plate , which changes with the fluid loading . for slender body swimmers ( @xmath16 ) , we have confirmed the linear dependence of @xmath10 on the aspect ratio , as reported in previous works @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we shall consider the added mass coefficient as    @xmath17    having established the appropriate expressions for @xmath14 and @xmath10 , the role of the reactive ( eq . [ fmax ] ) and resistive ( eq . [ fdx ] ) terms in the dynamical balance that governs the locomotion problem is therefore determined by the swimming kinematics . in the following , we will consider kinematics extracted from real swimmers both for anguiliform and carangiform archetypal species @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the specific extracted kinematic parameters are the beating amplitude @xmath18 ( as a function of the spinal - cord coordinate @xmath6 ) , the instantaneous wave speed of the bending wave @xmath19 and the instantaneous swimming speed @xmath20 . </S>",

    "<S> [ forcekinema],title=\"fig : \" ]    the simple comparison of these two real cases brings an observation worthy to be underlined : the physical mechanism at the origin of thrust production in inertial swimmers can be very different depending on the driving kinematics ( anguilliform vs. carangiform ) and on the aspect ratio ( long vs. short animals ) . especially , the resistive term which is usually associated to low reynolds number swimmers can be as large or even dominate over the added - mass based reactive mechanisms . </S>",
    "<S> it has to be noted that , without being discussed , this observation has already been reported in recent studies @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> concerning the swimming kinematics , the slip ratio @xmath32 and the amplitude distribution along the undulating body seem to be determinant for the selection of thrust production mechanisms . </S>",
    "<S> the remainder of the present work is devoted to studying the of our model swimmers to these parameters .    </S>",
    "<S> [ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]     first , in order to explore the dependency of the generated global thrust on the aspect and slip ratios , we assume that the deformation profiles remain constant regardless of the swimming and body wave speeds . </S>",
    "<S> fundamentally , kinematics parameters are in some cases interdependent , see for instance discussion in @xcite ; however , this hypothesis allows to pinpoint insightful underlying mechanisms . </S>",
    "<S> results are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ pdvsu ] . </S>",
    "<S> the presented phase diagrams allow to identify drag driven and added mass driven propulsion areas for both anguilliform and carangiform kinematics . for the case of anguilliform swimmers , small slip ratio values increase the dominance of drag forces in thrust production even for relatively high aspect ratios . </S>",
    "<S> this drag dominance diminishes as the slip ratio increases , until drag propulsion is no more possible for slip ratios @xmath33 . in general , </S>",
    "<S> eels and other anguilliform swimmers lie in the rage of aspect ratios @xmath34 , body wavelengths @xmath35 and slip ratios @xmath36 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although the kinematics can vary as a function of the slip ratio , anguilliform swimmers remain in regions where thrust is generated by a comparable contribution between lateral drag and added mass effects ( for high slip ratios ) . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the carangiform kinematics phase diagram is mostly dominated by added mass thrust production ( fig . [ pdvsu]-b ) . however , a region of drag dominated propulsion is observed for small slip and small aspect ratios . generally carangiform swimmers have aspect ratios around @xmath37 , body wavelengths @xmath38 and have slip ratios much larger than those of anguilliform swimmers , @xmath39 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it is relevant to mention that carangiform swimmers stay in regions of the kinematic phase space were drag - based thrust production is around zero , avoiding regions were lateral drag will start to produce negative thrust </S>",
    "<S> .    other important difference between the anguilliform and carangiform kinematics presented concerns the amplitude distribution along the body . while for the anguilliform swimmer the amplitude has almost a linear increment from the head up to the tail , in the carangiform swimmer the lateral displacements of the first part of the body are almost negligible and it is mainly based on the rear half of the moving body . however , both anguilliform and carangiform swimmers in nature adopt varied kinematics ( diverse amplitude distributions along the body ) , differing from the two particular cases presented previously . </S>",
    "<S> several models addressing the global description of anguilliform kinematics have been proposed in the literature to @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> following @xcite , we consider that the amplitude distribution of the swimmer is given by :    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is the amplitude of the displacement at the tail tip of the swimmer and @xmath42 represents the growth rate of the local amplitude all along the body ( i.e. the head to tail amplitude ratio ) . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ pdvsu]-c shows the regions dominated by either the added mass or the drag contributions to propulsion in an @xmath43 plane and underlines another important effect of the kinematics on the swimming mechanisms : for swimmers using small head to tail amplitude ratio @xmath44 ( as sketched in the left insert of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ pdvsu]-c ) , the thrust will be mainly produced by the local drag ( i.e. owing to energy dissipation rather than inertia ) . </S>",
    "<S> increasing @xmath42 gives more weight to the contribution of added mass mechanisms , which continues to increase as the kinematics tends to that of a carangiform swimmer . </S>",
    "<S> + thus , we have shown that introducing a local form drag term to the model describing an idealized inertial swimmer brings a much richer view of the thrust - producing mechanisms than the description commonly used for moderate to large reynolds number swimmers . as evoked previously , the distinction between resistive or reactive swimmers is usually based on the reynolds number . </S>",
    "<S> for very low reynolds numbers , swimmers are effectively resistive swimmers just because inertia is missing . in the inertial regime </S>",
    "<S> , this distinction is based on both kinematics ( through the ratio @xmath45 and @xmath42 ) and body geometry ( @xmath2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , we have seen that slender anguilliform swimmers use a combination of lateral drag and added mass effects in order to generate thrust , with a major resistive contribution for the most slender species . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , typical carangiform swimmers achieve propulsion using mainly the added mass effect , which is predicted by potential flow theories .    overall </S>",
    "<S> , these results have also an important impact on the design of artificial swimmers . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the magnetic swimmers developed by ramananarivo _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , which consist of passive flexible filaments ( with @xmath46 ) actuated at one end , rely mainly on lateral drag forces to generate thrust , although they swim at moderate reynolds regimes . as shown in figs . </S>",
    "<S> [ pdvsu]-a and [ pdvsu]-b , very slender swimmers will indeed rely mostly on drag thrust generation despite their swimming kinematics . </S>",
    "<S> also , due to the nature of their fluid - structure interactions ( see for example @xcite ) , artificial swimmers based on passive flexible structures with imposed pitching or heaving at one edge @xcite , tend in general to have wave amplitude distributions with small , or even negative , @xmath42 values ( see eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ amp ] ) . as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ pdvsu]-c , this can also promote the generation of thrust based mainly on lateral drag effects .    </S>",
    "<S> it is important to note that the conclusions brought with this work are based on the introduction of the local form drag term that accounts for local flow separation all along the body . </S>",
    "<S> this contribution , due to tridimensional geometrical effects ( the finite size of a fish ) , can not be neglected for a correct description of inertial swimmers , but is generally absent in most large reynolds number swimming studies . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that the results raised here may have significant implications not only for the description of swimming in nature but also for future conceptions of inertial artificial swimmers .    </S>",
