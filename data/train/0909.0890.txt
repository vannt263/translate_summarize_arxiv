    "on the spacetime @xmath2 we write as usual @xmath3 if there is a future directed causal curve connecting @xmath4 to @xmath5 , and write @xmath6 if @xmath3 or @xmath7 .",
    "the causal relation is given by @xmath8 .",
    "for fixed time orientation these notions depend only on the the class @xmath9 of metrics conformal to @xmath10 .",
    "once the causal relation is defined it is possible to define a _",
    "time function _ as a continuous function @xmath11 such that if @xmath3 then @xmath12 .",
    "in other words a time function is defined all over the spacetime , it is continuous , and increases over every causal curve . a time function which is @xmath13 with a past directed timelike gradient is a _",
    "temporal _ function .",
    "following @xcite , a semi - time function is a continuous function @xmath14 such that if @xmath15 then @xmath12 ( note that by continuity we have also @xmath16 ) .",
    "these definitions clarify that in the framework of general relativity the notion of causality is more fundamental than that of time . indeed ,",
    "not all the spacetimes admit a time function .",
    "a spacetime admits a time function iff it admits a temporal function iff it is stably causal @xcite .",
    "the history of this result is quite interesting .    in order to prove the existence of a time function geroch @xcite suggested to introduce a positive measure @xmath17 on spacetime so that @xmath18 has unit measure ( in fact this measure has to be chosen so as to satisfy some admissibility constraints @xcite ) , and to define @xmath19 . in globally hyperbolic spacetimes , and actually in causally continuous ones @xcite ,",
    "the idea works in fact @xmath20 can be shown to be continuous .",
    "nevertheless , these causality conditions are stronger than stable causality and without them @xmath20 is only lower semi - continuous .    the proof that stable causality implies the existence of a time function",
    "was obtained by hawking through a nice averaging technique @xcite . in short",
    "he noted that if the spacetime is stably causal then there is a one parameter family of metrics with cones strictly larger than @xmath10 , @xmath21 with @xmath22 $ ] , @xmath23 , so that @xmath24 is causal .",
    "he then defined @xmath25 where the function @xmath26 is defined as before but with respect to the metric @xmath27 .",
    "he was then able to prove the continuity of @xmath28 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the proof of the converse presents several difficulties particularly because a time function @xmath28 for @xmath2 need not be a time function for some @xmath29 with @xmath30 , consider for instance @xmath31 in the 1 + 1 minkowski spacetime of metric @xmath32 . nevertheless , the proof that a temporal function implies stable causality is easy @xcite and thus there remained the issue of proving that the existence of a time function implies the existence of a temporal function .",
    "this smoothability problem was considered by seifert @xcite but his arguments were unclear . a rigorous proof was finally given by bernal and snchez in @xcite .",
    "further insight to the problem of the existence of time come from the relational approach to causality .",
    "stable causality can be shown to be equivalent to the antisymmetry of the seifert relation @xcite @xmath33 ( a rigorous proof can be found in @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the nice feature of this relation is that it is both closed and transitive whereas @xmath34 has only the latter property and @xmath35 has only the former .",
    "in fact one may ask if @xmath36 is the smallest relation containing @xmath34 with this property . the answer is negative unless some causality conditions are added @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is natural to introduce the relation @xmath1 defined as the smallest closed and transitive relation which contains @xmath34 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the spacetime is said to be @xmath0-causal if @xmath1 is antisymmetric .",
    "recently @xcite , i have proved the equivalence between @xmath0-causality and stable causality and that if @xmath0-causality holds then @xmath37 .",
    "the previous result shows that the antisymmetry of @xmath1 implies stable causality and hence the existence of a time function .",
    "it seems reasonable to expect that ( i ) : this theorem depends only on the transitivity and closure properties of @xmath1 , and that therefore passing through stable causality should not be essential .",
    "( ii ) : the existence of a time function should imply @xmath0-causality ( or stable causality ) directly without using the smoothing argument . finally , given the fact that @xmath0-causality implies the existence of a time function one would like to prove that ( iii ) : under stable causality the set of time functions allowed by the spacetime can be used to recover the relation @xmath1 .    in a first version of this work i presented proofs for points ( ii ) and ( iii ) but then searching for fundamental results using only the closure of a relation in connection with problem ( i ) , i discovered a large body of literature in utility theory with important implications for causality ( most articles were published in economics journals ) .",
    "in fact the problem of the existence of a utility function in a set of alternatives for an individual is formally similar to that of the existence of time .",
    "surprisingly , these results have been totally overlooked by relativists . in the next section",
    "i summarize this long parallel line of research which will be used to draw implications for causality theory and in particular for the problem of the existence of time .",
    "i refer the reader to @xcite for most of the conventions used in this work .",
    "in particular , i denote with @xmath2 a @xmath38 spacetime ( connected , time - oriented lorentzian manifold ) , @xmath39 of arbitrary dimension @xmath40 and signature @xmath41 . on @xmath42 the usual product topology is defined . all the causal curves that we shall consider are future directed .",
    "the subset symbol @xmath43 is reflexive , @xmath44 .",
    "recall that a binary relation @xmath45 on a set @xmath46 is called a _ preorder _ if it is reflexive and transitive , a _ strict partial order _",
    "if it is irreflexive and transitive , and an _ equivalence relation _ if it is reflexive , transitive and symmetric .",
    "a preorder which satisfies the antisymmetry property @xmath47 and @xmath48 , is a _ partial order_. the preorder or strict partial order @xmath49 such that @xmath50 or @xmath51 , is _ complete_. the property , if @xmath52 then @xmath53 or @xmath54 is the _ totality _ property and is equivalent to completeness and reflexivity .",
    "a preorder which satisfies the totality property , is a _",
    "total preorder_. a preorder which respects both the totality and the antisymmetry property is a _",

    "complete order_.    for short we also write then while @xmath55 has the same meaning of the symbol @xmath56 in relativity , the relation @xmath57 coincides with @xmath58 only in causal spacetimes . ]",
    "@xmath59 if @xmath60 ; @xmath61 if @xmath47 and @xmath62 ; and @xmath63 if @xmath59 and not @xmath61 .",
    "the relation @xmath64 is an equivalence relation called the _ equivalence relation part _ while @xmath65 is a strict partial order called the _ strict partial order part_. their union gives @xmath49 , i.e. @xmath66 iff @xmath61 or @xmath67 .",
    "note that if @xmath49 is a partial order then @xmath65 is obtained from @xmath49 by removing the diagonal @xmath68 , and conversely @xmath49 is obtained by adding the diagonal to @xmath65 , that is , @xmath49 is the smallest reflexive relation containing @xmath65 ( the reflexive closure ) .",
    "given a ( total ) preorder @xmath49 , the quotient @xmath69 endowed with the induced order @xmath70\\le_r [ q]$ ] iff @xmath71 , is a partial ( resp .",
    "total ) order .    as usual",
    "we denote @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "we say that @xmath74 extends @xmath75 if @xmath76 and @xmath77 .    through a rather simple application of zorn s lemma szpilrajn @xcite proved    [ szp ] ( szpilrajn ) every strict partial order",
    "can be extended to a complete order . moreover , every strict partial order is the intersection of all the complete orders that extend it .",
    "( by adding the diagonal one has a corresponding statement for partial orders extended by total orders . )",
    "the former statement in the theorem is also known as the _ order extension principle_. the latter statement is sometimes attributed to dushnik and miller @xcite , however , although not stated explicitly in @xcite , it is a trivial consequence of a remark in szpilrajn s paper .    since to any preorder",
    "one can associate a partial order passing to the quotient with respect to the equivalence relation @xmath64 , it is easy to prove from theorem [ szp ] the following @xcite    every preorder can be extended to a total preorder .",
    "moreover , every preorder is the intersection of all the total preorders that extend it .",
    "i note that the proof in @xcite is such that the total extension can be chosen ( or restricted in the second part ) in such a way that the ` indifference sets ' @xmath70 $ ] are not enlarged passing from the preorder @xmath49 to its total extension @xmath78 , i.e. @xmath79 .",
    "these results were taken as reference for many other developments , and in fact have been generalized in several directions @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , in microeconomics the preference of an individual for a set of alternatives or prospects @xmath46 was modeled as a _",
    "total preorder _",
    "@xmath49 on @xmath46 .",
    "the idea was that an individual is able to tell whether one option or the other is preferred .",
    "these preferences were quantified by an _ utility function_. an utility for a transitive relation @xmath49 is a function @xmath80 with the _ strictly isotone_. note that constant functions are isotone . ]",
    "property ( citare birkoff ) namely that if and only if @xmath81 .",
    "] @xmath82 often on @xmath46 one has a topology which makes rigorous the idea that an alternative is similar or close to another . in this case",
    "one would like to have a _ continuous _ utility function otherwise the closeness of the alternatives would not be correctly represented by the utility .",
    "eilenberg @xcite and debreu @xcite ( see also @xcite ) were able to prove , under weak topological assumptions , that a continuous utility exists provided @xmath83 and @xmath84 are closed for every @xmath85 .    with the work of aumann @xcite and other economists it became clear that the assumption of totality was too restrictive .",
    "it turns out that it is unreasonable to assume that the individual is able to decide the preference for one of two alternatives .",
    "this conclusion is even more compelling if one models a group of persons rather than an individual . in order to include some indecisiveness the space of alternatives @xmath46 has to be endowed with a preorder",
    ", the totality condition being removed .",
    "the previous results on the existence of a continuous utility must therefore be generalized , and there is indeed a large literature on the subject .",
    "the reader is referred to the monograph by bridges and mehta for a nice reasoned account @xcite .",
    "the problem is of course that of finding natural conditions which imply the continuity of the utility function .",
    "we already suspect , given the suggestions from the spacetime problem above , that this property is the closure of the relation @xmath49 in @xmath86 , @xmath87 ( sometimes called _ continuity _ in the economics literature ) .",
    "in fact , it can be easily shown @xcite that for a total preorder this property coincides with that used in eilenberg and debreu theorem , namely : @xmath83 and @xmath84 are closed for every @xmath85 ( sometimes called _ semicontinuity _ in the economics literature ) .    in the literature many other direction have been explored but as we shall see the closure condition has given the most powerful results .",
    "considerably important has proved the work by nachbin @xcite , who studied in deep closed preorders on topological spaces and obtained an extension to this domain of the urysohn separation and extension theorems .",
    "these results were used to obtain new proofs of the debreu theorem @xcite , and over them have been built the subsequent generalizations .",
    "for our pourposes , the final goal was reached by levin @xcite who proved    [ lev ] ( levin ) let @xmath46 be a second countable locally compact hausdorff space , and @xmath49 a closed preorder on @xmath46 , then there exists a continuous utility function .",
    "moreover , denoting with @xmath88 the set of continuous utilities we have that the preorder @xmath49 can be recovered from the continuous utility functions , namely there is a _ multi - utility representation _",
    "@xmath89    curiously , as it happened for szpilrajn s theorem , the second part of this statement was not explicitly given in levin s paper .",
    "nevertheless , it is a trivial consequence of his proof that if @xmath90 then there is a continuous utility function such that @xmath91 ( see the end of the proof of ( * ? ? ? * lemma 8.3.4 ) ) .",
    "apparently , this representation possibility has been pointed out only quite recently in a preprint by evren and ok @xcite .",
    "clearly , levin s theorem can be regarded as the continuous analog of the szpilrajn s theorem .",
    "it is curious to note that while there was , as far as i know , no communication between the communities of relativists and economists these two parallel lines of research passed through the very same concepts .",
    "for instance , sondermann @xcite ( see also @xcite ) introduced a measure on @xmath46 and built an increasing function exactly as geroch did , even more his admissibility requirements for the measure were close to those later introduced by dieckmann @xcite in the relativity literature .",
    "as expected he could only obtain lower semi - continuity for the utility , indeed we know that geroch s time is continuous only if some form of reflectivity is imposed @xcite .    among the theorems which do not use in an essential way some closure assumption , which in most cases can be deduced from levin s theorem",
    ", a special mention deserves peleg s theorem which instead uses an openness condition @xcite . according to peleg a _",
    "strict _ partial order @xmath92 is _ separable _ if there is a countable subset @xmath78 of @xmath46 such that for any @xmath93 the diamond @xmath94 contains some element of the subset @xmath78 , and _ spacious _ if for @xmath95 , @xmath96 .",
    "( peleg ) let @xmath92 be a strict partial order on a topological space @xmath46 .",
    "suppose that ( a ) @xmath97 is open for every @xmath85 , ( b ) @xmath92 is separable , and ( c ) @xmath92 is spacious , then there is a function @xmath98 such that @xmath99 .",
    "note that @xmath100 is an utility in the sense of eq .",
    "( [ uti ] ) .",
    "it has been clarified that debreu s theorem can be regarded as a consequence of peleg s @xcite , while the relation with levin s theorem is less clear ( but see @xcite ) .",
    "we will be able to say more on that in the next section where we shall apply the previous theorems to the spacetime case .",
    "our strategy will be that of applying peleg s theorem to the open relation @xmath101 and levin s theorem to the closed relation @xmath1 .",
    "as we shall see the semi - time functions and the time functions correspond to the utilities for the relations @xmath101 and @xmath1 respectively , provided they are antisymmetric .",
    "we start with the former case      in this section we apply peleg theorem by setting @xmath102 , the spacetime manifold , and @xmath103 .",
    "the assumption that @xmath101 is a strict partial order is equivalent to chronology and conditions ( a ) and ( b ) of peleg s theorem are satisfied .",
    "note that in a chronological spacetime a continuous utility for @xmath101 is a continuous function @xmath28 such that @xmath104 , thus the continuous utilities for @xmath101 are exactly the semi - time functions .",
    "therefore we have only to understand the condition of spaciousness : @xmath105 .",
    "this problem is answered by the following    let @xmath2 be a spacetime , then the spaciousness condition , @xmath106 , is equivalent to the future reflectivity condition , @xmath107 .",
    "( the previous definition of future reflectivity is equivalent to the usual one @xmath108 , see @xcite . )",
