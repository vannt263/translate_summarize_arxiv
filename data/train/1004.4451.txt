    "the first observational evidence of @xmath1f stellar nucleosynthesis was reported by jorissen , smith & lambert ( 1992 , hereafter jsl ) .",
    "these authors derived f enhancements up to a factor 50 solar in a sample of galactic agb stars , and found a correlation between this enhancement and the c / o ratio . since the c / o is expected to increase as a consequence of third dredge up ( tdu ) episodes during the agb phase ( e.g. busso et al . 1999 ) , this was interpreted as a clear evidence of f production in these stars .",
    "further observational evidence of such a production exists from studies of post - agb stars ( werner , rauch & kruk 2005 ) and planetary nebulae ( otsuka et al . 2008 ) .",
    "other sites for f production have also been proposed : wolf - rayet stars ( meynet & arnould 2000 ) and neutrino spallation in core - collapse supernovae ( woosley & haxton 1988 ) . however",
    ", the role of these sources in the f budget is still uncertain ( cunha et al . 2003 ; palacios , arnould & meynet 2005 ) . nevertheless , from galactic chemical evolution models , renda et al .",
    "( 2004 ) concluded that all three of these three sources are required to explain the observed galactic evolution of f , as deduced from abundance determinations in field stars ( cunha & smith 2005 ; cunha , smith & gibson 2008 ) , although , only in agb stars there exist an observational confirmation that f production is an ongoing process .",
    "fluorine can be produced in agb stars from the nuclear chain @xmath2 ; where protons are mainly provided by @xmath3 and neutrons by @xmath4 .",
    "however , the theoretical attempts made to explain the jsl results are unsatisfactory .",
    "the problem is that current agb models fail to explain the highest f enhancements found in the c - rich objects of the jsl sample ( goriely & mowlavi 2000 ; lugaro et al .",
    "this discrepancy has led to a deep revision of the uncertainties in the nuclear reaction rates involved in the synthesis of f in agb stars ( lugaro et al .",
    "2004 ; stancliffe et al .",
    "2005 ) , to argue for alternative nuclear chains and/or to propose the existence of non - standard mixing / burning processes , similar to those commonly used to explain some of the isotopic anomalies found in dust grains formed in the envelopes of agb stars ( e.g. nollett et al .",
    "2003 ; busso et al .",
    "however , no solution has been found up to date , leaving the subject of the origin of this element open .    very recently , abia et al .",
    "( 2009 , hereafter paper i ) derived f abundances from vlt spectra in three galactic agb c - stars in common with the jsl sample , namely : aq sgr , tx psc ( n - type ) and r scl ( j - type ) , by using mainly the hf r9 line at @xmath5 m . in that work",
    ", we showed that this hf line is almost free of blends in agb c - stars and thus is probably the best tool for f abundance determinations in these stars ( see also uttenthaler et al .",
    "for these three stars , we derived f abundances @xmath6 dex lower in average than those obtained by jsl .",
    "we ascribed this difference to molecular blends ( mainly of c@xmath7 and cn ) .",
    "these new f abundances are in better agreement with the most recent theoretical nucleosynthesis predictions in low - mass ( @xmath8 m@xmath9 ) tp - agb models ( cristallo et al .",
    "motivated by this result , we have reanalysed the f abundances in the whole c - stars sample studied by jsl using the same tools as in paper i. in this letter , we confirm the results found in paper i and show that the new f abundances nicely agree with the theoretical predictions of low - mass tp - agb models .",
    "this apparently solves the long standing problem of f enhancements in agb stars without requiring the existence of any extra mixing / burning process .",
    "our data consist of high - resolution spectra * from @xmath10 to 2.5 @xmath11 m * obtained with the 4 m telescope at kitt peak observatory and a fourier transform spectrometer , which have been used in several abundance analysis of agb stars ( see lambert et al .",
    "1986 and jsl for details ) .",
    "typical resolutions ranged from 0.05 to 0.14 @xmath12 ( r@xmath13 to 30000 ) .",
    "these spectra contain many hf lines of the vibrational 1 - 0 band although we used only the lines r9 to r23 .",
    "high resolution optical spectra ( r@xmath14 ) * in the range @xmath15  * obtained at the 3.5 m tng at la palma observatory with sarg echelle spectrograph were also analysed .",
    "these spectra served us to derive the @xmath16element content in * the stars bl ori , st cam , y tau , cy cyg , rz peg and gp ori using the same procedure as in abia et al .",
    "( 2002)*. all program stars were ratioed with hot stars to remove telluric spectral features by using the task _ telluric _ within the iraf package .",
    "the typical s / n ratio of the spectra is larger than 100 .",
    "we adopted the stellar parameters ( t@xmath17 , log @xmath18 , [ fe / h ] , @xmath19 , * cno abundances * , c / o and @xmath20c/@xmath21c ratios ) derived by previous studies : abia et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and lambert et al .",
    "( 1986 ) for n - type stars , abia & isern ( 2000 ) for j - type stars and zamora ( 2009 ) for stars of sc - type ( see these works for details ) .",
    "in addition , we also adopted the @xmath22 ratios from the literature when available ( harris et al .",
    "1987 ) , although this has a minimal impact on the derived f abundance .",
    "the method of analysis involves the comparison of theoretical lte spectra ( computed with the _ turbospectrum _ code ) with the observed ones .",
    "we used the latest generation of c - rich atmosphere models for giant stars ( gustafsson et al .",
    "2008 ) and up - to - date molecular and atomic line lists in the spectral ranges studied ( see paper i for details ) .",
    "figure 1 shows an example of comparison between the observed and theoretical spectrum for the c - star uu aur ( n - type ) in two different spectral ranges .",
    "in particular , top panel shows the fit to the r15 and r16 hf lines , the sole lines used by jsl to derive the f abundance in the c - rich objects .",
    "it can be seen that we can reproduce reasonably well the observed spectrum and that the synthetic spectrum computed with the f abundance obtained by jsl ( lower dashed line ) , would overestimate the f abundance in this star . our best estimation in this star ( log @xmath23 , continuous line in fig .",
    "1 ) fits quite well the six hf lines used , with a dispersion of only @xmath24 dex ( see also table 1 ) .",
    "similar quality fits were obtained for all the stars except for v hya , which was excluded from the analysis since its effective temperature is outside the range covered by our grid of models .",
    "table 1 lists the final f abundance derived in each star , assigning double weight to the r9 line when estimating the mean f abundance because this is the less blended among the available hf lines ( see paper i for a discussion ) . for most of the stars ,",
    "more than three different hf lines were used .",
    "the agreement between the different lines is in general good with a typical mean dispersion of @xmath25 dex .",
    "the formal error in the f abundance due to uncertainties in the stellar parameters ranges from @xmath26 dex , depending on the particular hf line . considering the abundance dispersion and the uncertainty in the continuum position as additional sources of error",
    ", we estimate an total uncertainty of @xmath27 dex in the [ f / h ] ratio ( see paper i )",
    ". however , the abundance ratio between f and any other element typically has a smaller error since some of the above uncertainties cancel out when deriving the abundance ratio : for the [ f / fe ] ratio we estimate a total uncertainty of @xmath28 dex .",
    "the third column in table 1 shows the difference found between the f abundance derived by jsl and this work .",
    "the differences range from 0.3 dex up to more than 1 dex , the average value being @xmath29log @xmath30(f)@xmath31 , confirming the main result of paper i. as noted there , differences in the stellar parameters adopted in the analysis can not explain this discrepancy .",
    "actually , the major differences are found for the t@xmath17 values , which for the n- and j - type stars in the sample , do not exceed 150 k. in the case of sc - type stars , differences in adopted t@xmath17 may reach up to 300 k , but in any case , this can not explain the differences of more than @xmath32 dex in the f abundance found in some of these stars .",
    "differences in the atomic data are also discarded since we used exactly the same hf line list than jsl .",
    "finally , differences between the grid of model atmospheres might account up to a maximum of 0.15 dex , for the n- and j - type stars . for the sc - type stars",
    ", we found the largest abundance differences ( see table 1 ) . for these stars , atmosphere models indeed play a significant role .",
    "jsl used for the analysis of sc stars johnson ( 1982 ) models , while we use those from gustafsson et al .",
    "* for instance , considering the typical stellar parameters of a sc star in the sample ( t@xmath17/log g/[fe / h]@xmath33 and c / o@xmath34 ) , we find differences in the f abundance from @xmath35 dex ( r9 , r15 and r16 lines ) to @xmath36 dex ( r23 line ) * when using johnson models instead of gustafsson et al .",
    "ones , * but it may reach up to @xmath37 dex for lower t@xmath17*. in any case , for the n- and j - type stars , we conclude ( as in paper i ) that the difference between the molecular line list used is the main cause of the discrepancy with respect to the analysis of jsl * ( see table 2)*. for the sc - type stars , it is a combination of that , the use of a different grid of model atmospheres and , in the case of cy cyg and gp ori , the adoption here of a t@xmath38 k cooler . it should be mentioned that the structure of the c - rich atmosphere models change dramatically with a tiny variation of the c / o ratio when it is very close to 1 , as it is the case for sc stars . therefore , the abundance analysis in these stars are affected by systematic differences between the model atmosphere and the real star and/or the treatment of the molecular equilibrium in the computation of the atmosphere models . in consequence , for sc - type stars",
    "the uncertainty in [ f / h ] is certainly larger than @xmath39 dex .",
    "the main consequence of the new f abundances is that the large [ f / fe ] ( or [ f / o ] ) ratios ( up to 1.8 dex ) found by jsl in galactic agb c - stars are systematically reduced .",
    "the largest f enhancements are now close to @xmath40 dex .",
    "these enhancements can be accounted for by current low - mass tp - agb nucleosynthesis models of solar metallicity , as we will show below . as noted in  1 , during the ascension along the agb , fresh carbon",
    "is mixed within the envelope due to tdu episodes .",
    "eventually , an o - rich agb star becomes a c - star when the c / o ratio in the envelope exceeds 1 .",
    "similarly , f is also expected to increase in the envelope during the agb phase , thus a fluorine vs. carbon correlation should exist .",
    "figure 2 shows the observed relationship derived in this study .",
    "we have also included in this figure the intrinsictc ( @xmath41 yr ) in their envelopes ( smith & lambert 1990 ) , revealing their intrinsic nature . ] o - rich agb stars studied by jsl ( not analysed here , open circles ) . excluding the j - type stars ( triangles ) , a clear increase of the f abundance with the c abundance can be seen .",
    "this behaviour is well reproduced by theoretical agb models .",
    "lines in fig . 2 show the predicted f and c content in the envelope ( cristallo et al .",
    "2010 ) for a 1.5 m@xmath9 with different metallicities ( continuous lines ) and 2 m@xmath9 model ( dashed line ) with solar metallicity .",
    "these metallicities match those of the stellar sample ( @xmath42[fe / h]@xmath43 ) .",
    "the theoretical curves start with an envelope composition as determined by the first dredge - up and end at the last tdu episode . on the other hand , fig .",
    "2 seems to indicate that o - rich stars and sc stars ( squares ) have f abundances systematically larger than n - type stars ( dots ) for a given c abundance .",
    "similarly to the intrinsic c - stars , also in the case of the o - rich stars this may be simply due to a systematic error affecting the analysis : in fact , for stars of spectral types k and m ( with [ fe / h]@xmath44 ) , jsl derived an average f abundance @xmath45 dex higher ( 4.69 ) than the solar f abundance adopted here ( 4.56 ) .",
    "these k and m stars are sub - giants or rgb stars , thus they are not expected to present f enhancements . excluding that the sun might be anomalous with respect to nearby stars of similar metallicity ( f determinations in unevolved dwarf stars are needed in this sense )",
    ", blends may also play a role in the analysis of f lines in o - rich agb stars . decreasing the f abundances by 0.13 dex in them",
    ", the agreement with theoretical predictions would be definitely better .",
    "however , it does not apply to the case of the star bd@xmath46 ( at log @xmath30(f)@xmath47 in fig .",
    "2 ) ; the large f enhancement in this star can be only obtained in metal - poor agb models , but this star has [ fe / h]@xmath48 .",
    "something similar seems to occur with sc - type stars .",
    "sc stars are agb stars with c / o@xmath49 . according to the accepted chemical ( spectral ) evolution along the agb ( m@xmath50ms@xmath50s@xmath50sc@xmath50n ) , these stars should present equal - or - slightly lower f enhancements than n - type stars . however , some of the studied sc stars clearly deviate from this sequence , showing larger f abundances with respect to n stars .",
    "this is reinforced by wz cas ( [ fe / h]@xmath44 , at the right upper corner of fig .",
    "2 ) , which shows a huge f enhancement .",
    "we remind , however , that this star is indeed peculiar : it is one of the few super li - rich c - stars known , also presenting very low @xmath20c/@xmath21c ( 4.5 ) and @xmath51o/@xmath52o ( 400 ) ratios .",
    "the fact that most of the sc - stars studied here show low or no @xmath16element enhancements ( see below ) , makes the evolutionary status of these stars very uncertain .",
    "the connection between the f and the @xmath53-process is less straightforward .",
    "there are two different contributions to the f production in low mass agb stars .",
    "the first comes from the @xmath54n production in the radiative @xmath21c pocket , the site where the s - process main component is built up : when , during the interpulse period , the @xmath4 is activated within the pocket , some protons are released by the main poisoning reaction , @xmath3 , thus producing @xmath54n via @xmath55 .",
    "the second contribution involves the same reaction chain , but it is activated when the @xmath21c left by the advancing h - burning shell is engulfed into the convective zone generated by a thermal pulse . in the latter case , the correlation with the @xmath16process is less stringent , because the resulting neutron flux is not enough to give rise to a sizable production of elements beyond iron . at nearly solar metallicity ,",
    "the latter contribution accounts for @xmath5670% of the total f production * ( e.g .",
    "cristallo 2006)*. nevertheless , a correlation between the f and the @xmath16element overabundance is in any case expected if a large enough @xmath21c pocket forms after each dredge up episode .",
    "figure 3 shows the new [ f / fe ] ratios in c - stars vs. the observed average @xmath16element enhancement * ( from abia et al .",
    "2002 ; zamora 2009 or derived in this work , see  1 ) * .",
    "j - type stars are not shown in this figure as they do not have @xmath16element enhancements ( see table 1 ; abia & isern 2000 ) . similarly to fig .",
    "2 , we have included the intrinsic o - rich stars analysed by jsl taken their @xmath16element content from smith & lambert ( 1990 ) .",
    "it is clear that the f and @xmath16nuclei overabundances correlate and that this correlation is nicely reproduced by theoretical tp - agb stellar models ( cristallo et al . 2010 ) .",
    "the theoretical predictions in fig . 3 correspond to 1.5 , 2 and 3 m@xmath9 tp - agb models with z@xmath57 ( [ fe / h]@xmath58 , the average metallicity of the stars analysed here ) starting from the 1@xmath59 tp pulse .",
    "the number of tps calculated until the occurrence of the last tdu is indicated in the figure for each model .",
    "models with a metallicity within @xmath60 dex of this value do not significantly differ from those in figure 3 .",
    "in addition , with the combination of models with different stellar mass and metallicity , it is possible not only to reproduce the new observed [ f / fe ] vs. @xmath16element relationship , but also the detailed f and @xmath16element abundance pattern observed in a particular star ( see e.g. fig . 3 in paper i ) . note that this is not possible for most of the stars when adopting the f determinations of jsl",
    ".    as already noted , sc - type stars ( except gp ori ) show larger f abundances than predicted by low - mass agb models with the same @xmath16element enhancement .",
    "a possible explanation could be that the sc stars are more massive ( in average ) than the bulk of the n - type c - stars . from agb models with mass of about 3 - 5 m@xmath9",
    ", we expect smaller @xmath21c pockets and weaker @xmath16element surface enrichments , even if the number of tps and tdu episodes is larger .",
    "it occurs because the larger the core mass is , the smaller the he - rich intershell is with a steeper pressure gradient .",
    "notwithstanding , the @xmath21c left in the ashes of the h - shell still provide a substantial contribution to the fluorine production .",
    "recent studies of the luminosity function of galactic c - stars ( guandalini 2008 ) support such a hypothesis .",
    "they indicate that the sc - type stars are among the most luminous agb c - stars .",
    "once again , the case of wz cas is particularly extreme .",
    "this star shows a huge f abundance ( [ f / fe]@xmath61 ) with almost no @xmath16element enhancement .",
    "its large li abundance might be interpreted as a consequence of the hot bottom burning ( hbb ) mechanism which operates only for m@xmath62 m@xmath9 .",
    "* however , the operation of the hbb would be at odds with the presence of f in the envelope since @xmath63o might destroy @xmath1f*. detailed abundance studies ( including f ) in a larger sample of sc - stars is needed to confirm this hypothesis .",
    "fluorine abundances in galactic agb carbon stars are determined from high resolution infrared spectra using state - of - the - art c - rich spherical model atmospheres , updated atomic and molecular line lists and lte spectral synthesis .",
    "we derive f abundances that are in average @xmath6 dex lower than those derived in previous studies . a clear correlation between the f and @xmath16element enhancements is found .",
    "the new fluorine enhancements can be explained by standard low - mass agb stellar models .",
    "f abundance determinations appear as a valuable tool to test theoretical agb models .",
    "studies of the f abundance in metal poor unevolved and agb stars are mandatory to understand the galactic abundance evolution of this element and to evaluate the role of agb stars in its origin , respectively .",

    "<S> an analysis of the fluorine abundance in galactic agb carbon stars * ( 24 n - type , 5 sc - type and 5 j - type ) * is presented . </S>",
    "<S> this study uses the state - of - the - art carbon rich atmosphere models and improved atomic and molecular line lists in the @xmath0 m region . </S>",
    "<S> f abundances significantly lower are obtained in comparison to previous study in the literature . </S>",
    "<S> the main reason of this difference is due to molecular blends . in the case of carbon stars of sc - type , </S>",
    "<S> differences in the model atmospheres are also relevant . </S>",
    "<S> the new f enhancements are now in agreement with the most recent theoretical nucleosynthesis models in low - mass agb stars , solving the long standing problem of f in galactic agb stars . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , some sc - type carbon stars still show larger f abundances than predicted by stellar models . </S>",
    "<S> the possibility that these stars are of larger mass is briefly discussed . </S>"
