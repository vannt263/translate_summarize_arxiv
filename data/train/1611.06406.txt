    "functions of finite matrices have received a lot of interest in the literature both for their theoretical properties and for the many applications they have in real world problems .",
    "we refer the interested reader to the book @xcite for more details . among the available different definitions of matrix function , which are equivalent under mild hypotheses , many rely on the jordan canonical form of the matrix argument or on its schur form . as a consequence , they are not directly generalizable to the setting of infinite matrices . however , there are two definitions which apparently seem to be more suited for extending the concept of function to infinite matrices .",
    "they rely on the laurent series expansion , and on the integral representation through the dunford cauchy formula @xcite .    in the set of matrices with infinite size",
    "there is a class which is a cornerstone for numerical linear algebra .",
    "it is the class of toeplitz matrices @xmath12 associated with a function @xmath0 , called symbol , defined by @xmath5 .",
    "toeplitz matrices are widely analyzed in the literature , from the pioneering papers by o. toeplitz , to the seminal monograph by grenander and szeg @xcite , until to the more recent and wide contributions given by several international research groups , including , but not limited to , the books @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and the papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite with the references cited therein . for a general view on this topic we refer the reader to the monograph @xcite which collects a wide set of contributions and gives the taste of the problems in this area and an idea of their richness .    in some problems ,",
    "typically encountered in the analysis of stochastic processes , like bi - dimensional random walks in the quarter - plane , one has to deal with matrices of the kind @xmath6 , where @xmath13 is a semi - infinite toeplitz matrix , while @xmath7 is a non - toeplitz correction such that @xmath8 .",
    "we call this class of matrices _ quasi - toeplitz _ matrices , in short qt matrices , and denote them with @xmath14 .",
    "we consider the subset of qt matrices whose symbol @xmath4 is differentiable and both @xmath4 and @xmath15 belong to the wiener class .",
    "we call the latter as the set of cqt matrices and we denote it with @xmath16 .    from the computational point of view , one has to solve matrix equations where the coefficients are cqt matrices , or to compute the value of @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is an assigned function , typically the exponential function , and @xmath19 is a cqt matrix .    concerning the recent literature in this research area , it is worth citing the paper @xcite where the exponential function of a block - triangular block - toeplitz matrix is analyzed with application to solving certain fluid queues . in the recent paper @xcite the problem of computing the exponential function of finite toeplitz matrices is investigated and several applications are presented . in @xcite the case of the exponential of a semi - infinite cqt matrix is analyzed in depth . related issues concern the decay of the coefficients of a matrix function @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and the decay of the singular values of matrices having a displacement rank structure @xcite .    in this paper , our interest is addressed to analyze the definition and the properties of @xmath17 , for @xmath19 being a cqt matrix .",
    "this work continues the analysis recently started in @xcite and in @xcite where the classes of qt and cqt matrices have been introduced and analyzed , and where the exponential function has been extended to the case of cqt matrices .    here",
    "we deepen this analysis by considering matrix functions assigned either in terms of a laurent power series or in terms of the dunford - cauchy integral .",
    "we give conditions on the function @xmath18 and on the cqt matrix @xmath19 in order to ensure that the semi - infinite matrix @xmath17 is well defined and is still a cqt matrix , i.e. , it can be written in the form @xmath20 .",
    "moreover , we outline some algorithms for its computation .",
    "finally , we show that the same analysis can be applied to the case where the matrix is finitely large and can still be written as the sum of a toeplitz matrix and a correction .    a case of interest concerns matrices associated with an analytic symbol @xmath4 where the coefficients of the toeplitz part have an exponential decay .",
    "this situation is very convenient from the computational point of view .",
    "however , the class of matrices that we obtain this way , which we call analytically quasi - toeplitz ( aqt ) , is still a matrix algebra , but is not a banach space with the norm @xmath21 . in the analysis that we carry out ,",
    "we point out the cases where the result of the computation is still in the class of aqt matrices .    the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec:2 ]",
    "we recall the representation of semi - infinite cqt matrices and the description of the arithmetic in this matrix algebra .",
    "moreover , we outline the way to extend this definition to the case of finitely large matrices where @xmath19 can still be written as @xmath6 , and the correction @xmath22 has nonzero entries in the upper leftmost corner and in the lower rightmost corner , so that the rank of @xmath22 is small with respect to its size .    in section [ sec:3 ]",
    "we generalize the concept of matrix functions to semi - infinite cqt matrices . as first step",
    ", we consider the case where the function @xmath9 is assigned in terms of a power series and give conditions under which @xmath17 is still a cqt matrix . then we analyze the case where @xmath9 is given in terms of a laurent series .",
    "also in this framework , we give conditions under which @xmath17 is a cqt matrix .",
    "we examine some computational issues and outline an algorithm for computing a general matrix function of a cqt matrix . some numerical tests which demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach",
    "are presented both for semi - infinite and for finite matrices .",
    "section [ sec:3.2 ] is devoted to the extension of the concept of matrix function based on the dunford - cauchy integral .",
    "once again , we provide conditions under which @xmath17 is a cqt matrix . finally , we discuss some computational issues , outline an algorithm for computing @xmath17 based on the trapezoidal rule , and present a validation of our theory by means of some numerical tests . in section [ sec : conc ] we draw some conclusions and research lines .",
    "we indicate with @xmath23 the unit circle of the complex plane @xmath24 , with @xmath25 and @xmath26 the ring of relative integers and the set of positive integers , respectively .",
    "we denote by @xmath27 the wiener class , i.e. , the set of complex valued laurent series @xmath0 such that @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "we also define the set @xmath30 .",

    "the function @xmath4 is said _ symbol _ associated with @xmath13 .",
    "moreover , denote by @xmath40 the set of semi - infinite matrices @xmath41 such that @xmath42 .      dealing with an infinite amount of data",
    "can be an insurmountable problem from the computational point of view .",
    "however , such difficulties can be overcome whenever the data to be processed are representable at an arbitrary precision with a finite number of parameters . with this motivation , in @xcite",
    "the authors introduce the following classes of infinite matrices .",
    "[ def : qt ] a semi - infinite matrix @xmath19 is said _ quasi toeplitz ( qt - matrix ) _ if it can be written in the form @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "we refer to @xmath13 as the toeplitz part of @xmath19 , and to @xmath22 as the correction .",
    "if @xmath4 belongs to @xmath46 then we say that @xmath19 is a cqt matrix .",
    "finally , if @xmath4 is analytic in an open annulus enclosing @xmath47 , then the matrix @xmath19 is said _ analytically quasi toeplitz ( aqt - matrix)_. the classes of qt - matrices , cqt - matrices and aqt - matrices are denoted by @xmath14 , @xmath16 and @xmath48 , respectively .",
    "we report some properties of these classes .",
    "more details are given in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the first result shows that @xmath14 is a banach space , while @xmath49 is a banach algebra .",
    "[ thm : qt ] the class @xmath14 is a banach space with the norm @xmath50 . the class @xmath16 is a banach algebra equipped with the norm @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the first derivative of @xmath4 .",
    "the class @xmath53 is a normed algebra equipped with the norm @xmath21 .",
    "moreover , @xmath54 for any @xmath55 , and @xmath56 for any @xmath57 .",
    "[ rem : cauchy]it is interesting to notice that @xmath58 with the norm @xmath21 is not banach . in fact , consider the sequence of semi - infinite toeplitz matrices @xmath59 with @xmath60 , and observe that this is a cauchy sequence in @xmath48 with the norm @xmath21 , but its limit does not belong to @xmath48 because the corresponding symbol @xmath61 is not analytic . on the other hand , the completeness of @xmath16 implies that any cauchy sequence in @xmath48 admits limit in @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , we can claim that the limit of a cauchy sequence in @xmath48 can still be represented at an arbitrary precision with a finite number of parameters .",
    "+ the next result from @xcite provides a representation of the product of two semi - infinite toeplitz matrices .",
    "[ th:1 ] for @xmath62 let @xmath63 .",
    "then we have @xmath64    the following result from @xcite provides a representation of the matrices @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",

    "this observation explains how to compute functions of semi - infinite cqt - matrices by means of convergent sequences of rational approximations .",
    "for this reason , in @xcite the design and the analysis of a matrix arithmetic for cqt matrices has been introduced . in particular ,",
    "a cqt matrix @xmath6 is represented in the following form .",
    "the toeplitz part @xmath13 is represented up to an arbitrarily small error by means of the finite sequence @xmath78 of the coefficients of the laurent polynomial @xmath79 which approximates the function @xmath0 for suitable @xmath80 .",
    "the correction @xmath22 is represented by two finite dimensional matrices @xmath81 and @xmath82 such that @xmath83 coincides with the non negligible part of @xmath22 . here",
    "@xmath81 and @xmath82 have size @xmath84 , @xmath85 , respectively where @xmath86 and @xmath87 are the sizes of the leading submatrix of @xmath22 which contains the non - negligible entries , while @xmath88 is the rank of this submatrix .    this way , a matrix in @xmath16 is represented by means of the triple @xmath89 up to any controllable small error @xmath90 .",
    "each arithmetic operation , say , @xmath91 , is defined by means of a set of equations which provide the components of the triple @xmath92 associated with the matrix @xmath93 in terms of the components of the triples @xmath94 and @xmath95 associated with @xmath19 and @xmath96 , respectively . similarly , matrix inversion is implemented by providing the relation between the triple @xmath94 associated with @xmath19 and the triple @xmath92 associated with @xmath97 .",
    "an operation of compression is introduced to reduce the sizes of @xmath98 and @xmath99 obtained after each operation .",
    "more details can be found in @xcite .",
    "given a symbol @xmath4 and @xmath100 we indicate with @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 the @xmath104 leading principal submatrices of @xmath13 , @xmath39 and @xmath38 , respectively .    the approach used in section  [ sec : arith ] can be easily adapted to design a matrix arithmetic for quasi toeplitz matrices of finite size . the crucial tool for doing this extension is a version of theorem [ th:1 ] which applies to the finite case .",
    "[ thm : toep - mul ] let @xmath105 , @xmath106 and set @xmath107 .",
    "then , @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the @xmath104 flip matrix having 1 on the anti - diagonal and zeros elsewhere .",
    "a pictorial description of the above theorem is given in figure [ fig:0 ] where @xmath4 and @xmath110 are laurent polynomials of degree much less than @xmath111 so that @xmath101 and @xmath112 are banded .",
    "if @xmath113 , @xmath114 with @xmath115 much smaller than @xmath116 , then the matrices @xmath117 and @xmath118 have disjoint supports located in the upper leftmost corner and in the lower rightmost corner , respectively .",
    "thus , @xmath119 can be represented as the sum of the toeplitz matrix associated with the laurent polynomial @xmath120 and of two correction matrices @xmath121 and @xmath122 which collect the finite number of nonzero entries located in the upper leftmost and in the lower rightmost corners , respectively .",
    "algorithms for dealing with finite quasi toeplitz matrices can be easily obtained from those presented in @xcite just by taking into account the additional lower rightmost corner correction . in the case of a sufficiently large gap between the size @xmath111 and the bandwidth @xmath115 of the symbols that come into play ,",
    "the two corner corrections behave independently of each other and the finite cqt matrix arithmetic becomes more effective .",
    "the cost of these operations essentially depends on the bandwidth of @xmath123 and on the sizes and ranks of the correction matrices @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "the cost remains small as long as the bandwidth and the size of the corrections @xmath121 , @xmath122 remain small together with their rank . whether this condition is not satisfied ,",
    "the two corrections may spread and overlap .",
    "this may cause a slowdown due to the additional operations which are needed in the computation .",
    "in this section we give conditions under which a function @xmath9 , expressed in terms of a power series or a laurent series , can be applied to matrices @xmath19 in the class @xmath16 , and prove that under these conditions @xmath17 still belongs to @xmath124 .",

    "thus for sufficiently large values of @xmath158 and @xmath115 , the latter summation is smaller than any given @xmath159 so that the sequence @xmath160 is cauchy .",

    "that is , @xmath163 is well defined and belongs to @xmath16 .",

    "the above integral can be approximated by means of a quadrature formula with nodes @xmath282 and weights @xmath283 , i.e. , @xmath284 the approximation schemes are determined with the strategy of increasing the number of nodes until the required precision is reached .",
    "if the weights are non - negative , the approximation converges for @xmath285 to @xmath17 .",
    "we consider the trapezoidal approximation scheme with a doubling strategy for the nodes .",
    "that is , we consider the double indexed family @xmath286 such that :    * @xmath287 and @xmath288 , * @xmath289 are equally spaced points in @xmath290 $ ] @xmath291 , * @xmath292 and @xmath293 , @xmath294",
    ".    in particular , observe that the nodes at a certain step @xmath295 correspond to those with odd indices at step @xmath296 .    using a trapezoidal approximation of the integral",
    "we can prove that the function of a cqt - matrix is again a cqt - matrix .",
    "let @xmath179 be a cqt - matrix with spectrum @xmath297 and symbol @xmath67 .",
    "let @xmath18 be an analytic function defined on the domain @xmath298 which encloses @xmath297 such that @xmath299 .",
    "assume that @xmath276 admits a differentiable arc length parametrization @xmath279\\rightarrow \\partial \\omega$ ] .",
    "then @xmath17 is a cqt - matrix .",
    "moreover , if @xmath144 then @xmath145 .    given the family @xmath300 of nodes and weights of the trapezoidal approximation scheme for we consider the sequence of rational functions in @xmath19 : @xmath301 where @xmath236 is defined according to and the latter equality follows from the fact that @xmath276 is a closed simple curve , thus @xmath302 .",
    "this sequence is formed by cqt - matrices whose limit , if it exists , has a toeplitz part with symbol @xmath128 .",
    "therefore , it is sufficient to show that this sequence is cauchy with respect to the norm @xmath21 .",
    "consider the difference @xmath303 and observe that ( for notational simplicity we omit the superscript @xmath304 in the nodes ) @xmath305 where @xmath306\\rightarrow \\mathbb c$ ] , @xmath307 .",
    "assuming that @xmath308 has continuous second derivative , then @xmath309 is a lipschitz function .",
    "indicating with @xmath310 the lipschitz constant of @xmath311 and defining @xmath312 , @xmath313}|l(x)|$ ] we get @xmath314 where we used @xmath315 and the identity @xmath316 .",
    "in particular , we can write @xmath317 where @xmath318 is independent of @xmath295 . therefore , given @xmath319 , we have @xmath320 which proves that @xmath321 is a cauchy sequence in the banach algebra of @xmath16-matrices .",
    "by relying on the same arguments used in the proof of theorem [ th:7 ] we deduce that @xmath172 .",
    "so if @xmath4 is analytic in a certain annulus @xmath322 containing @xmath47 then there exists @xmath323 such that @xmath324 .",
    "thus the composed function @xmath172 is analytic in @xmath146 .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "numerical integration based on the trapezoidal rule at the roots of unity can be easily implemented to approximate a matrix function assigned in terms of a dunford - cauchy integral .",
    "in fact all the operations involved in the computation reduce to performing matrix additions , multiplication of a matrix by a scalar and matrix inversion .",
    "the latter operation is the one with the highest computational cost .",
    "we applied the contour integral definition for computing @xmath325 and @xmath326 where @xmath269 is the @xmath104 matrix @xmath327 considered in section  [ sec : exp1 ] .",
    "we used the trapezoidal rule with a doubling strategy for the nodes for integrating on a disc which contains the spectrum of @xmath328 . since @xmath269 is rescaled to have spectrum in @xmath329 $ ] , we selected as center of the disc @xmath330 and radius @xmath331 .",
    "table [ tab : result2]-[tab : result3 ] report the execution time , the residuals , the toeplitz bandwidth and the features of the correction as the size of the argument increases exponentially .",
    "once again , we reported only the features of one correction because , due to the symmetry of @xmath19 , the upper left and lower right corner corrections are equal .",
    "we have extended the concept of matrix function to cqt matrices , i.e. , infinite matrices of the form @xmath6 , by showing that , under suitable mild assumptions , for a cqt matrix @xmath19 and for a function @xmath9 expressed either in terms of a power ( laurent ) series , or in terms of the dunford - cauchy integral , the matrix function @xmath17 is still a cqt matrix .",
    "we have outlined algorithms for the computation of @xmath17 .",
    "this approach has been adapted to the case of @xmath332 where @xmath333 is the @xmath104 leading principal submatrix of @xmath19 .    among the open issues that will be part of our research interests",
    ", it would be interesting to analyze the behavior of the singular values @xmath334 of the @xmath104 truncation of the correction @xmath252 such that @xmath335 , and relate the decay of these values for @xmath336 and for @xmath337 , to the qualitative properties of the function @xmath4 .",
    "in fact , from the numerical experiments that we have performed with several functions @xmath4 , it turns out that the numerical rank of @xmath252 remains bounded by a constant independent of @xmath115 .",
