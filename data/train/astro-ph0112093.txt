    "the strongest water maser emission in the dominant center @xmath45 , the sio maser source , and the apparent vertex of the central cluster of h@xmath0o maser spots @xmath46 are approximately colinear on the sky . the position angle of this line is @xmath47 , and the distance between @xmath45 and @xmath46 is @xmath48 au ( assuming a distance of @xmath49 kpc ) . schneps et al . ( 1981 ) measured proper motions of the h@xmath0o masers from 1977 to 1979 that indicate that @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( denoted `` nw cluster '' and `` dominant center reference '' in their paper ) are moving away from each other in the plane of the sky at @xmath50 km s@xmath1 along this position angle .",
    "( we estimated the uncertainty in this determination from the dispersion in the proper motions of five maser spots in the dominant center reference cluster from the data in schneps et al . )",
    "we confirm the proper motion by comparing the separation of clusters @xmath45 and @xmath46 from schneps et al .",
    "( 1981 ) to the separation measured by us 19 years later ( figure [ fig : dc ] ) .",
    "we measure an increase of separation from @xmath51 to @xmath52 and find @xmath53 km s@xmath1 , which is consistent with schneps et al .",
    "imai et al .",
    "( 2001 ) present an independent estimate of the proper motions based on recent short time - baseline vlba observations , and report a relative velocity between @xmath45 and @xmath46 of @xmath54 km s@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "in addition to confirming the @xmath45-@xmath46 proper motion measured by schneps et al .",
    "( 1981 ) , our observations show that the h@xmath0o maser structures retained their shapes as they moved apart .",
    "specifically , as shown in figure [ fig : dc ] , the structures of @xmath45 and @xmath46 have not changed significantly over the 19 years .",
    "( slight discrepancies between the two images can be partially attributed to the fact that schneps et al .",
    "( 1981 ) covered velocities from -10 to 80 km s@xmath1 , while the observations presented here covered velocities from 20 to 100 km s@xmath1 . )",
    "this is particularly noteworthy because the distribution of h@xmath0o masers in cluster @xmath46 suggests that it traces the limb of a bow shock , and we actually see this bow shock moving persistently outward over a 19 year interval .",
    "the sio maser emission lies in between the h@xmath0o maser complexes @xmath45 and @xmath46 on the sky and is effectively coincident with the peak of thermal nh@xmath10 emission ( figure [ fig : w51-big ] ) .",
    "the spectrum of the sio maser emission covers velocities from @xmath55 to 60 km s@xmath1 , which lie within the velocity extent of the h@xmath0o maser emission ( figure [ fig : spec ] ) , but are offset from the peak of thermal emission from nh@xmath10 ( and other molecular tracers ) at @xmath56 km s@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "we resolved the angular structure of the w51-irs2 sio maser source with both the vla and the vlba data .",
    "the source has a linear structure with a position angle of @xmath57 ( figures [ fig : siomasrs ] and [ fig : siomasrs - vlba ] ) .",
    "the sio maser also shows an apparent gradient in line - of - sight ( los ) velocity with position , with redder spots to the west and bluer spots to the east . from the data shown in figures [ fig : siomasrs ] and [ fig : siomasrs - vlba ]",
    ", we estimate this gradient to be @xmath58 km s@xmath1 mas@xmath1 ( @xmath59 km s@xmath1 au@xmath1 ) .",
    "the sio maser emission seems to be distributed along a northern and a southern `` arm '' , and the los velocities of the two arms are offset by 5 to 10 km s@xmath1 ( figure [ fig : siomasrs - vlba ] ) .",
    "the vla image is more sensitive to the large scale structure in the sio maser source but less accurate in pinpointing emission centers than the vlba .",
    "specifically , the rms sensitivities are 7 mjy for the vla and 14 mjy for the vlba , while the angular resolutions are @xmath20 mas and @xmath37 mas , respectively . thus , while the observed emission in the vla image may be a flux - weighted centroid of structures smaller than the beamsize , the vlba image reveals the positions of the compact core components .",
    "the total flux in the vlba spectrum is considerably less than that of the vla spectrum ( figure [ fig : spec ] ) , which is probably due to the different instrument resolutions and/or source variability .",
    "figure [ fig : w51-big ] shows the radio continuum emission in the vicinity of w51-irs2 .",
    "detection of w51d and w51d2 is consistent with previous observations @xcite .",
    "we did not detect any radio continuum emission in the dominant center region , setting an upper limit of @xmath59 mjy at 22 ghz .",
    "the lack of radio continuum emission in a dense molecular core traced by maser emission and thermal nh@xmath10 emission indicates that any compact optically thick hii region in the dominant center is too small to be detected ( i.e. @xmath60 au at @xmath61 k ) , perhaps due to confinement by accretion from the surrounding molecular cloud ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or by outflow ( or both ) .",
    "the positional coincidence and velocity overlap of the sio and h@xmath0o maser emission with a peak in the thermal nh@xmath10 emission ( figures [ fig : w51-big ] and [ fig : spec ] ) probably signifies that the masers trace star forming activity in the denser portions of a molecular cloud core .",
    "the outflowing motions of the h@xmath0o masers on scales of @xmath62 au and the apparent bow shock structure @xmath46 also support this conclusion .",
    "we suggest that the sio maser source in w51-irs2 marks the position of a massive protostar , because of excitation requirements of the @xmath63 sio maser emission ( @xmath64 @xmath65 , @xmath66 k ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , the absolute position of the protostar is within 5 mas of our reference vla sio astrometric position , @xmath67 ( @xmath68 , @xmath69 ) .",
    "we surmise that the exciting protostar is massive based on an estimate of the mechanical luminosity of the h@xmath0o maser outflow : assuming an h@xmath0 density for the outflow of @xmath70 @xmath65 ( realistic based on the h@xmath0o and oh maser emission in the vicinity ; elitzur 1992 ) , an opening angle of @xmath71 , and flow velocity of @xmath72 km s@xmath1 , we find @xmath73 @xmath74 .",
    "the two - armed linear structure of the sio maser is suggestive of a diverging outflow on scales @xmath75 au ( figure [ fig : siomasrs - vlba ] ) .",
    "we propose that the sio maser emission may trace the limbs of a rotating conical bipolar outflow from a massive protostar . in the context of this model",
    ", we can localize the relative position of the exciting protostar on very small scales . specifically , we speculate that the protostar lies within several au ( @xmath42 mas ) of the intersection of the northern and southern limbs ( although the absolute position is known to only @xmath76 mas ) .",
    "the velocity gradient of the sio maser emission , present along the northern ( blue ) arm and the southern ( red ) arm ( figure [ fig : siomasrs - vlba ] ) , implies acceleration along the putative outflow .",
    "this acceleration is also visible in the vla image ( figure [ fig : siomasrs ] ) , which shows bluer emission to the east and redder emission to the west , as expected .",
    "however , the vla and vlba data both show some blue emission that is inconsistent with the fitted acceleration of @xmath58 km s@xmath1 mas@xmath1 . we suggest that this emission may not be associated with the proposed diverging outflow , but it may instead be associated with a separate dynamical component ( e.g. , a disk or associated wind , as in hollenbach et al .",
    "1994 ) .",
    "the outflow traced on small scales by sio maser emission appears to be reflected on large scales by the h@xmath0o maser complexes @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the position angle on the sky of the sio outflow ( @xmath57 ) is consistent with the angle of the outflow traced by the motions and positions of clusters @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( figure [ fig : dc ] ) . the bow shock h@xmath0o maser structure @xmath46 subtends the same opening angle as the sio maser emission ( @xmath77 ; figures [ fig : dc ] and [ fig : siomasrs - vlba ] ) .",
    "although @xmath45 does not show a clear bowshock morphology ( perhaps due to inhomogeneities or gradients in the ambient medium ) , the angle subtended by the strongest h@xmath0o maser emission in @xmath45 is consistent with the proposed outflow .",
    "the h@xmath0o maser emission also shows the same general trend in los velocity as the sio maser emission , with bluer emission to the east and redder emission to the west .",
    "thus , it appears that the sio maser emission traces the limbs of a collimated diverging conical flow close to the exciting source , while the h@xmath0o masers trace the shocks that form where the ballistic outflow runs into ambient material .",
    "( we note that the ultracompact hii region w51d has a bowshock morphology whose position angle is close to that of the h@xmath0o outflow and bowshock , which may be a coincidence or may be indicative of a larger scale outflow from the dominant center region along the same position angle . )",
    "we estimate the angle of the putative outflow with respect to the plane of the sky , @xmath78 , by comparing the proper motions and line - of - sight velocities of the h@xmath0o maser complexes @xmath45 and @xmath46 : @xmath79 where @xmath80 km s@xmath1 is half the difference in los velocity between @xmath45 and @xmath46 and @xmath81 km s@xmath1 is half the speed at which @xmath45 and @xmath46 are separating on the sky .",
    "because of the large dispersion in the los velocities of h@xmath0o maser clusters @xmath45 and @xmath46 , this is only a rough estimate .",
    "we may also estimate @xmath78 by combining los velocity information from the sio maser emission with the proper motions of the h@xmath0o maser emission . for purposes of discussion ,",
    "we assume a common acceleration . on small scales",
    "the acceleration is given by @xmath82 . here , @xmath83 au ( 4 mas ) is the measured transverse distance from the intersection of the two arms to the easternmost maser spot in figure [ fig : siomasrs - vlba ] , and @xmath84 km s@xmath1 is the measured difference in line - of - sight velocity between these features . on larger scales ,",
    "the acceleration is given by @xmath85 , where @xmath86 au ( @xmath87 ) and @xmath88 km s@xmath1 are the transverse separation and transverse velocity difference of the sio maser and h@xmath0o maser complexes @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( where we assume that the transverse velocity of the sio maser is effectively @xmath89 ) . if @xmath90 , then the angle of the outflow is given by @xmath91 however , a constant acceleration over @xmath92 au is unlikely to occur . for a decelerating flow , @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "if we assume constant acceleration of the jet out to @xmath95 with no acceleration thereafter , we obtain @xmath96 , consistent with the value estimated from equation [ eq:1 ] .",
    "thus , the outflow probably lies within 20@xmath97 of the plane of the sky .    for the simple case of constant acceleration",
    ", we estimate the acceleration of the outflow to be @xmath98 km s@xmath1 yr@xmath1 , which gives a line - of - sight acceleration of @xmath99 km s@xmath1 yr@xmath1 . for a decelerating flow ,",
    "the implied acceleration on the scale of the sio maser emission is larger .",
    "this is consistent with a 0.4 km s@xmath1 yr@xmath1 drift in the line - of - sight velocity of individual sio maser spectral features reported by fuente et al .",
    "( 1989 ) . however , the velocities of spectral components measured by others after 1989 ( hasegawa et al .",
    "1986 ; morita et al . 1992 ; this work ) are not entirely consistent with the trend fit by fuente et al .",
    "( 1989 ) , and the fluxes of components vary by over an order of magnitude from observation to observation .",
    "although suggestive , we conclude that the estimated acceleration from fuente et al . should be treated with caution .    using our estimate of the angle of the outflow with respect to the plane of the sky , we can also make an order of magnitude estimate of the mass loss rate for the putative protostar .",
    "assuming that the outflow consists primarily of molecular hydrogen with a density of @xmath100 @xmath65 ( reasonable for sio maser excitation ; elitzur 1992 ) , we find @xmath101 here , @xmath102 is a proton mass , @xmath103 au is the distance between the two limbs of sio maser emission measured at the easternmost maser spot in figure [ fig : siomasrs - vlba ] , @xmath84 km s@xmath1 is defined above , and @xmath104 is the upper limit on the angle of the outflow with respect to the plane of the sky under the assumption of constant acceleration .",
    "we note that our estimate is consistent with those for other massive protostars , @xmath105 @xmath106 yr@xmath1 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we estimate the line - of - sight velocity of the exciting protostar by averaging the velocities of the sio maser features on the north and south limbs of the outflow : @xmath107 km s@xmath1 .",
    "this is significantly different than the @xmath108 systemic velocity of the dominant center region obtained from interferometric observations of thermal nh@xmath10 emission @xcite .",
    "however , the linewidth of the thermal nh@xmath10 emission is @xmath109 , and the angular resolution of the nh@xmath10 observations is @xmath110 .",
    "thus , it is possible that the molecular core has several components ( possibly marked by the other clusters of h@xmath0o maser emission in the dominant center region ) , which are moving at different los velocities , and perhaps the protostar that is driving the outflow discussed here is associated with one of these components .",
    "we postulate that the conical outflow rotates ( counterclockwise ) about the axis of outward flow in order to explain the @xmath42 km s@xmath1 difference in los velocity between the north and south limbs of sio maser emission seen in figure [ fig : siomasrs - vlba ] .",
    "the ratio of transverse to rotational energy is @xmath111 i.e. , most of the kinetic energy is in the outward flow component .",
    "rotating bipolar outflows have been theorized to occur due to `` x - winds '' where magnetocentrifugal effects drive the outflow @xcite , or due to the interaction of a spherical protostellar wind with a time - dependent infall from a parent molecular cloud @xcite .",
    "the limbs are presumably a preferred site of maser emission because the longer path lengths and the similarity of projected los velocities result in greater amplification .",
    "the limbs of a conical bipolar outflow traced by sio masers have also been observed in orion - kl , though without rotation @xcite .    instead of a conical flow",
    ", the two arms of sio maser emission in w51 could also indicate the presence of two protostars , possibly comprising a close binary system , wherein the north and south arms trace two separate outflows .",
    "while this model can also explain our results , the coincidence of the opening angle of the sio maser emission with the angle subtended by the bow shock structure leads us to favor the conical outflow model .",
    "we also consider a precessing jet model . were the precessing jet to behave like a rigid rod ,",
    "then magnetic coupling to ionized ambient material might account for the observed velocity structure of the sio maser emission .",
    "however , it is more likely that such a jet would instead be ballistic , in which case the precession cone of the jet would have no `` limbs '' where the observed path length is greatest .",
    "in this case , if the jet comprises knots or bullets of material , visible emission would appear to `` fill '' the precession cone , something we do not see .",
    "a possible `` fix '' is if the precessing jet shocks sio in a rotating `` cocoon '' of gas , exciting maser emission .",
    "if the decay time for emission of shocked gas is long compared to the precession time - scale of the jet , this model would lead to observed sio maser emission identical to the rotating conical outflow model .",
    "if this model is correct , then it should be possible to detect periodic changes in the brightness of the arms of sio maser emission detected with the vlba .",
    "the variations in brightness of the two arms should be out of phase .",
    "we have resolved the structure of the w51-irs2 sio maser source , and linked it to a protostellar outflow associated with two long - known sites of intense h@xmath0o maser emission .",
    "we propose that the masers trace an accelerating bipolar protostellar outflow inclined @xmath112 with respect to the plane of the sky , which may detectably rotate about the axis of flow within tens of au of the protostar .",
