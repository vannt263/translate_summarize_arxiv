    "the recent developments in experimental techniques permit us to produce different types of nanomaterials with a few atoms such as nanowires , nanotubes , nanorods and nanocubes . as a result of these outstanding properties ,",
    "there has been growing interest in the study of magnetic nanomaterials both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "these nanomaterials have been already used with a great success in many different areas such as sensors @xcite , permanent magnets @xcite and medical applications @xcite .",
    "magnetic properties and phase transition characteristics of nanoparticles strongly depend on the size and the dimensionality of the particle .    it should be mentioned that nanotubes have been attracting considerable attention , especially after the discovery of carbon nanotubes @xcite , and investigation of the mechanical , electrical , optical and magnetic properties of nanotubes is still an active research area . at the present time ,",
    "ferromagnetic nanotubes have been successfully fabricated @xcite , and they are promising for various technological applications @xcite .    various types of nano structures , such as @xmath0 and @xmath1 nanotubes @xcite , can be modeled by core - shell models and the physical properties of considered systems can be determined by benefiting from the well defined methods such as mean field approximation ( mfa ) , effective field theory ( eft ) and monte carlo simulation techniques ( mc ) . from the theoretical point of view , phase transition characteristics as well as other magnetic properties of core - shell nanotube systems have been determined by making use of classic ising model within the framework of standard eft formulation @xcite .    as far as we know , there exists a limited number of studies focusing on the physical nature of the core - shell nanotube system using heisenberg model .",
    "for example , classical heisenberg model on a single wall ferromagnetic nanotubes has been solved with mc @xcite and many - body green s function method @xcite .",
    "furthermore , three - leg quantum spin tube @xcite has been solved with numerical exact diagonalization within the finite - cluster @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present work is to probe the influences of the anisotropy in the exchange spin - spin interactions on the critical temperature and the order parameter of the core - shell structured heisenberg nanotube in detail . for this aim",
    ", we use the eft formulation in 4-spin cluster .",
    "it is a well known fact that eft can provide better results than mfa , due to the consideration of self spin correlations , which are omitted in the mfa .",
    "eft-2 formulation @xcite mostly used for the heisenberg model .",
    "however , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ formulation ] , aforementioned formulation can not give satisfactory results for this system .",
    "hence , we derive eft formulation for 4-spin cluster for the core - shell nanotube system .    the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ formulation ] we briefly present the model and formulation , the results and discussions are presented in sec .",
    "[ results ] , and finally sec . [ conclusion ] contains our conclusions .",
    "we have also two appendices for the details of the formulation .",
    "one layer of the nanotube system is given in fig .",
    "the system is infinitely long along the axes which is perpendicular to the figure plane .",
    "the inner portion of the system called core ( number of 6 spins in each layer ) , while the outer one called shell which has number of 12 spins in each layer .",
    "the hamiltonian of the anisotropic heisenberg model can be simply given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 denote the pauli spin operators at a site @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath6 and @xmath7 stand for the components of the exchange interactions between the nearest neighbor spins located at sites @xmath5 and @xmath8 .",
    "the sum is carried over the nearest neighbors of the lattice .",
    "the exchange interaction components @xmath9 between the spins on the sites @xmath5 and @xmath8 takes the values according to the positions of these nearest neighbor spins . let the exchange interaction components between the nearest neighbor spins located at the core be @xmath10 and the shell be @xmath11 .",
    "the exchange interaction components between the nearest neighbor spins located at the core and the shell be @xmath12 .    as discussed above in short , eft-2 formulation @xcite mostly used in the literature to analyze the phase transition properties of different types of magnetically interacting many - body systems .",
    "it is possible to say that it is generalization of the same formulation within the ising model @xcite to the heisenberg model .",
    "strictly speaking , in eft-2 formulation , two spins located @xmath13 and @xmath14 sites of system ( i.e. @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) are selected and then the 2-spin cluster is constructed by benefiting from the selected spins .",
    "interactions between these two spins treated exactly whereas interactions between a spin in a chosen cluster and a spin belongs to the out of the cluster treated approximately .",
    "some mathematical difficulties arise due to nature of the formulation , and in order to avoid it we replace the perimeter spins of the 2-spin cluster by ising spins ( axial approximation ) @xcite .",
    "the aforementioned formulation has been successfully applied to a great deal number of geometries such as bulk materials @xcite , and finite sizes magnetic systems @xcite .",
    "we should also emphasize that the finite - size systems have multiple exchange interactions between different spins , so multiple clusters are required to define the considered system in a good way . in contrary to the finite - size systems , one cluster is enough for infinite - size materials since they have translational invariance properties .",
    "one of the ways providing mathematical simplicity is axial approximation but it brings about some deficiencies . for example , with using axial approximation the heisenberg character of the exchange interaction is loss and this corresponds to working spins which are outside of the cluster with only @xmath17 component .",
    "it is possible say that one of the two nearest neighbor spins having only @xmath17 component is in the selected cluster and the other is outside of the cluster .",
    "it is clear that eft-2 formulation with axial approximation can not give reasonable results for the nanotube geometry .",
    "the considered system has three different types of exchange interactions and 2-spin cluster formulation can not handle three of them exactly with the heisenberg character .",
    "it should be underlined that larger cluster are needed in order to get a better result for this problem . indeed",
    ", the numerical processes begin to complicate and computational cost rises as size of the cluster increases .",
    "one of the suitable choices is 4-spin cluster called eft-4 formulation , and it has been already applied to the investigation of ising model @xcite .",

    "[ sek2 ] , the phase transition temperature of the studied system gradually decreases when the value of @xmath109 rises starting from zero and the discussed behavior does not sensitively depend on the values of @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "it is obvious that an increment in value of @xmath109 corresponds to the decreasing anisotropy in the exchange interaction .",
    "at this point , in order to better understanding of the mechanism underlying the system , it is beneficial to talk about the limit cases of @xmath117 which are 0.0 and 1.0 .",

    "in other words , a relatively small amount of thermal energy is needed to observe a phase transition in the system with further increment in @xmath117 .",
    "moreover , it can be said that all changes of the phase transition temperatures of the core - shell heisenberg nanotube system occur in the range of @xmath118 for all combination of hamiltoanian parameters",
    ". the lower value of critical temperature corresponds to the phase transition temperature of the isotropic heisenberg nanotube , while the relatively bigger one refers to the critical temperature of the ising nanotube . as the value of the @xmath105 rises , then critical temperature of the system decreases within the range mentioned above . in fig .",

    "[ sek2 ] ( a)-(c ) ) .",
    "same situation is also valid for the changing of the interaction type of the core from the @xmath122 type to the isotropic heisenberg type ( see curves labeled by @xmath120 and @xmath123 in fig .",

    "this observation is as mentioned above .    in the following analysis , in order to see the influences of the anisotropy in the exchange interaction on the critical temperature of the core - shell nanotube system in another perspective , the equally valued critical temperature curves in the ( @xmath124 ) plane are depicted for the selected values of @xmath125 , in fig .",
    "each numbers accompanying of the curves are the phase transition temperature and it can clearly deduce from the figure that lower critical temperatures occur of the considered system for the higher values of @xmath126 .",
    "in addition to these , equally valued critical temperature curves do not exhibit symmetry with respect to the @xmath127 line , due to the different number of spins of the core and the shell .",
    "the shell has number of @xmath128 spins , while the core has number of @xmath129 spins .",
    "it is also expected result that the critical temperature of the system be more affected by the change of @xmath109 than @xmath115 .",
    "now , we want to investigate the effect of the anisotropy of the exchange interaction on the order parameter , i.e. the magnetization . to do this",
    ", we define the core and the shell magnetization as    @xmath130 where @xmath131 and @xmath132 stand for the magnetization of the core and shell , respectively .",
    "the values of the @xmath133 can be determined with the procedure explained in sec .",
