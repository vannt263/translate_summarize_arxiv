    "finding point correspondences in image pairs of a static scene is a classical problem in stereo and structure from motion ( sfm ) . finding correspondences in wide baseline setups , i.e. , when the cameras focal centers are distant , is particularly challenging .",
    "images obtained in such setups are generally subject to significant distortion and their content may differ substantially also due to occlusion .    the problem of wide baseline stereo matching has received significant attention in recent years ( see a brief review in section  [ sec : review ] ) .",
    "existing approaches have focused largely on developing better feature descriptors for correspondence and on accurate recovery of epipolar line constraints . however , although challenging , the problem of finding correspondences once the epipolar geometry has been estimated has not yet received sufficient attention . in this paper",
    "we introduce a novel method for finding correspondences in wide baseline image pairs of a static scene . noting that matching is often ambiguous even when epipolar constraints are taken into account , we propose to address the problem by using deformation maps to model geometric changes along epipolar lines .",
    "specifically , given two images and an estimated fundamental matrix , our algorithm seeks to compute a geometric map that relates the images and satisfies two requirements ; first , it should respect the epipolar constraints , and , secondly , we bound the amount of distortion that the mapping can exert locally .",
    "we refer to such a map by _ epipolar consistent bounded - distortion _ ( ebd ) map .",
    "our core theoretical contribution is in showing that , while the set of maps whose distortion is bounded is non - convex , its intersection with maps that satisfy the epipolar constraints ( with an ordering assumption @xcite ) is convex , allowing us to introduce an efficient matching algorithm .",
    "_ bounded distortion _ ( bd )",
    "maps are continuous , locally injective transformations whose conformal distortion at every point ( defined as the condition number of their jacobian matrices ) is bounded . intuitively , the conformal distortion measures how different the local map is from a similarity transformation , , how much local aspect ratio is changed . bounding the conformal distortion",
    "is motivated by the following observation .",
    "suppose two cameras are set so that their image planes are parallel ( including as special case rectified setups ) .",
    "for any fronto - parallel plane it can be readily verified that its projections onto the two image planes are related by a similarity transformation .",
    "therefore such projections undergo no distortion . bounding the distortion in these setups therefore limits the slant and tilt of the recovered planes .    to formulate our solution we define a cost function that seeks an ebd map that maximizes the number of matches .",
    "we optimize this robust objective using majorization - minimization .",
    "the use of a robust objective allows us to recover when certain portions of the images are distorted beyond the bounds allowed by our algorithm or when the set of initial correspondences include outliers .",
    "we have tested our method on datasets containing pairs of images with ground truth matches and compared it to several state - of - the - art methods .",
    "our method consistently outperformed these methods .",
    "the problem of wide baseline stereo matching has been approached by a number of studies .",
    "considerable effort has been put into designing better features and descriptors and into utilizing them to estimating the fundamental matrix .",
    "several studies have used affine invariant features @xcite .",
    "a wide variety of alternatives to the sift descriptor @xcite have been proposed , emphasizing speed ( e.g , the daisy descriptor  @xcite ) or invariance to extreme transformations such as scale changes  @xcite .",
    "other studies have utilized line segments  @xcite and regional features ( e.g. , mser  @xcite and texture - based descriptors  @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite groups coplanar points by identifying homographies and uses them to estimate epipolar lines .",
    "a few of those descriptors were designed to also account for occlusion ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "finally , a number of studies have approached the problem from a multiview perspective  @xcite .",
    "relevant to our work also are generic methods for robust , dense matching , based on a variety of point - feature and regional descriptors , such as the sift - flow  @xcite , patch - match  @xcite , nrdc  @xcite , ldof  @xcite and , more recently , spm @xcite , as well as models of deformation ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) , which can potentially be applied in a wide baseline setting .",
    "another recent study @xcite proposed an algorithm for mosaic stitching by finding a map that smoothly departs from a global affine transformation .",
    "our experiments include comparison to @xcite and  @xcite modified to seek matches near corresponding epipolar lines .",
    "we show the results of our method are superior to these methods even despite these modifications , suggesting that our global model of deformation provides a more suitable model for wide baseline stereo .    our model of deformation maps",
    "is derived from the work of  @xcite , that proposed an approach for optimizing functionals over bounded distortion transformations using sequences of convex optimization .",
    "@xcite further used this approach for robust feature matching in general pairs of images  ( analogous to ransac  @xcite , but allowing many degrees of freedom ) .",
    "our work shows that the set of ebd maps are convex , allowing us to introduce an efficient algorithm that is less sensitive to initialization .",
    "in this section we describe our algorithmic approach to the problem of wide baseline image matching .",
    "we assume we are given two images @xmath0 , with their fundamental matrix @xmath1 either supplied as input or computed automatically , e.g. , using ransac  @xcite .",
    "our goal is to find a map @xmath2 from @xmath3 to @xmath4 that relates corresponding points in the two images ; , for every pair of corresponding points , @xmath5 , the desired map satisfies @xmath6 .",
    "we start with a large set of candidate corresponding pairs of points @xmath7 , @xmath8 .",
    "then , we search for a map @xmath2 , from the family of epipolar @xmath9-bounded distortion mappings @xmath10 ( defined below ) that matches as many pairs @xmath11 as possible .",
    "specifically , we aim at optimizing    [ e : opt ] @xmath12    where for @xmath13 the norm @xmath14 is defined by : @xmath15 if @xmath16 , and @xmath17 otherwise .",
    "the optimization problem strives to maximize the number of matched pairs under the deformation model .",
    "this can be seen by noting that the energy counts how many pairs @xmath18 are not matched by @xmath2 . similarly to @xcite , we solve by : 1 ) computing a set of candidate pairs of correspondences @xmath18 ; and 2 ) optimizing using an iterative re - weighted least - squares ( irls ) approach .",
    "however , differently from previous work , we devise a novel formulation of the bounded distortion deformation model that is shown to be _ convex _ when matching images under the epipolar constraint .",
    "the convex model facilitates the optimization of , allows considerably faster optimization times , incorporates epipolar constraints , and does not require any particular initialization or convexification .",
    "we explain the deformation model next .      at the core of our method",
    "is a convex characterization of the space @xmath10 of epipolar bd deformations . in a nut - shell ,",
    "@xmath10 is a one parameter family of non - rigid deformations that allow bounded amount of distortion and respect epipolar constraints . to formulate @xmath10",
    "we introduce a _ triangulation _",
    "@xmath19 on image @xmath3 , where @xmath20 is the vertex set , @xmath21 the edge set , and @xmath22 the triangles ( faces ) .",
    "a mapping @xmath23 is represented by prescribing new locations to the vertices of the triangulation in the second image , @xmath24 .",
    "the mapping @xmath2 is defined as the unique piecewise - linear ( pl ) mapping satisfying @xmath25 .",
    "we denote by @xmath26 the affine map of the restriction of @xmath2 to the triangle @xmath27 .    using the entire collection of pl mappings @xmath28 defined on a triangulation @xmath29 is way too general as every vertex",
    "is allowed to move arbitrarily and in the context of stereo this will allow unreasonable geometries to be considered .",
    "instead , we will restrict our attention to a one parameter family of mapping spaces @xmath10 that translate to a reasonable assumption of the scene s geometry .",
    "in particular , in addition to imposing epipolar line constraints , we suggest to bound the deviation of the affine maps @xmath30 from similarity transformations using a parameter @xmath31 as is defined below .",
    "we next derive this constraint for a single affine transformation and later show how to set the constraints for the entire triangulation @xmath32 to define @xmath10 .",
    "we now focus on a single affine map .",
    "a general planar affine map can be written uniquely as @xmath33 where , @xmath34 are a similarity matrix , an anti - similarity matrix ( , a reflected similarity ) , and a translation vector , respectively @xcite . the ratio of frobenious norms of the anti - similarity and similarity parts , , @xmath35 provides a natural scale - invariant measure for deviation of @xmath36 from a similarity .",
    "in fact , @xmath37 is the _ conformal distortion _ of the affine map , which equals the ratio of the maximal singular value to the minimal singular value ( , the condition number ) of the linear part of the affine map , @xmath38 .",
    "we therefore set the @xmath9-bounded distortion constraint , @xmath39 where as mentioned above @xmath31 is a parameter of the deformation space .",
    "we note that an affine map satisfying is also orientation preserving since @xmath40 and @xmath31 .",
    "the bounded - distortion constraint is not convex and requires some convexification to work with in practice  @xcite .",
    "however , surprisingly , it becomes convex when we intersect this constraint with the epipolar line constraints ( assuming epipolar line pairs can be oriented , as we explain below ) .",
    "more generally , when the affine map @xmath36 is known to map some directed line @xmath41 ( , epipolar line ) to another directed line @xmath42 , while preserving the direction , then eq .   can be formulated as a convex constraint in @xmath43 , see figure [ fig : epibd ] for an illustration .",
    "we summarize this in a proposition ,    [ prop : basic ] the collection of @xmath9-bounded - distortion planar affine transformations that map a directed line @xmath41 to another directed line @xmath42 is convex .",
    "we start by proving the proposition for the case that the directed lines both coincide with the @xmath44-axis with the positive direction , @xmath45 where @xmath46 . by assumption",
    "we have in particular that @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "this implies that @xmath49 where @xmath50 .",
    "plugging this into , squaring and rearranging we get @xmath51 if we show that @xmath52 then taking the square - root of both sides of leads to a ( convex ) second - order cone ( soc ) constraint , @xmath53 indeed , since @xmath54 and implies that @xmath55 we must have @xmath52 .",
    "we have therefore shown that any affine map that satisfies the assumption and maps the real axis @xmath56 to itself by preserving the positive direction has to satisfy and . in the other direction , any non - zero affine map that satisfy and maps @xmath56 to itself while preserving the positive direction ( since @xmath57 ) and satisfies .",
    "for general directed lines @xmath58 we can represent any affine map @xmath59 satisfying the assumptions of proposition [ prop : basic ] as @xmath60 where @xmath61 , @xmath62 , are similarities that map the @xmath44-axis @xmath56 ( with positive direction ) to @xmath63 , and @xmath36 is @xmath9-bounded - distortion that maps @xmath56 to itself while preserving the positive direction as above .",
    "note that this change of coordinates does not change the distortion @xmath64 of the affine map .",
    "therefore , the collection @xmath65 of all affine maps satisfying the assumption of the proposition with general lines is convex .",
    "the consequence of this proposition is that the set of @xmath9-bounded distortion affine transformations that map an epipolar line in one image to an epipolar line in another image is convex , provided that the pair of epipolar lines can be oriented . consider a pair of epipolar lines @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "it can be readily shown that any planar patch in 3d whose front size is visible to both cameras will project to @xmath41 and @xmath42 with consistent orientation .",
    "we note however that for more general scene structures orientation may not always be preserved . still , many stereo algorithms assume _ ordering _ ( dating back to  @xcite ) .",
    "we therefore conclude with the following corollary :    [ prop : basic_epi ] the collection of @xmath9-bounded - distortion planar affine transformations that map a directed epipolar line @xmath41 to another directed epipolar line @xmath42 is convex .",

    "let us denote @xmath67 the coefficient of this affine map @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 are all linear functions of the degrees of freedom @xmath71 ( , the mapped vertices ) of the mapping @xmath2 as follows , @xmath72 } \\hspace{-0.0 cm } = \\hspace{-0.0 cm } \\hspace{-0.1cm}{\\left [ \\begin{array}{ccc } \\hspace{-0.175cm}{\\widetilde{\\vecv}}_i & \\hspace{-0.175 cm } { \\widetilde{\\vecv}}_j & \\hspace{-0.175 cm } { \\widetilde{\\vecv}}_k \\hspace{-0.175cm}\\\\ \\end{array}\\right ] } { \\left [ \\begin{array}{ccc } \\hspace{-0.17cm}\\vecv_i & \\hspace{-0.175cm}\\vecv_j & \\hspace{-0.175 cm } \\vecv_k \\hspace{-0.175cm}\\\\ \\hspace{-0.17cm}1 & \\hspace{-0.175cm}1 & \\hspace{-0.175 cm } 1 \\hspace{-0.175 cm } \\\\ \\end{array}\\right ] } ^{-1}\\ ] ] where here @xmath73 are viewed as vectors in the plane . note that the inverted matrix ( the rightmost matrix in  ) is constant as it only depends on the source triangulation s vertices @xmath74 . therefore ,",

    "see figure [ fig : epibd ] for an illustration .",
    "for the third vertex of @xmath75 ( shown in red ) we can impose its epipolar constraint by adding the suitable linear equation . adding these equations for all triangles @xmath78 ( one soc and a few linear equality constraints per triangle ) results in a convex socp realization of the space of pl mappings @xmath10 with a single distortion parameter @xmath79 .          in order to construct @xmath10",

    "we further determine the orientations of the epipolar lines .",
