    "an experiment using x - ray single crystal diffraction at the swiss - norwegian beam lines ( snbl ) of european synchrotron radiation facility ( esrf ) on a single crystal of cubic perovskite bmt ( @xmath0 ) has shown an interesting diffuse scattering pattern , consisting of cube - shaped domains of nearly constant intensity , with the centers located on the ( 1/2,1/2,1/2 ) points of the reciprocal lattice and with an edge of @xmath6 of a reciprocal lattice unit ( rlu ) .",
    "all the cubes have the same intensity level , apart from the usual slow modulations due to atomic and thermal factors .",
    "bmt belongs to perovskites of formula ab@xmath1b@xmath2o@xmath3 ( a = ba , b@xmath4ta , b@xmath5 mg ) where different species on the b - site can be ordered to various degrees .",
    "the scattering depends on the site occupancy and when the ordering is directly related to the pair correlation function of the different atomic sites  @xcite .",
    "in fact , bmt in its cubic phase is necessarily intrinsically disordered in the b - site . in this paper",
    "we shall mainly explore the chemical order at the b - site and show that the cube - like diffuse scattering can be fully explained in this way .",
    "lattice deformations and displacements , due to different atomic radii of mg and ta ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , are expected .",
    "so there is additional diffuse scattering originating from these correlated displacements .",
    "in fact streak - like diffuse scattering - relatively weaker - has been found at the foot of the cubic bragg peaks , see fig .",
    "we shall address also this point in a future paper .",
    "the simplest possibility for b - site ordering is the formation of subregions enriched in either mg or ta cations .",
    "this possibility , however , has been thoroughly ruled out as energetically unfavourable in ab@xmath1b@xmath2o@xmath3 perovskites  @xcite because of the large charges in the subregions .",
    "there are then different homogeneous ways of ordering the b@xmath7-b@xmath8 cations .",
    "these are :    * homogeneous random distribution of b - cations ; * correlated distribution with occupation numbers being a well - defined function of distance between two lattice nodes , but without periodicity ; * periodic long range ordering of the mg / ta concentrations in different sublattices .    situation i ) would give an almost wavevector - independent diffuse scattering , but this is not observed .",
    "b - site ordering of type iii ) has been observed in bmt , with simultaneous lowering of the cubic symmetry .",
    "in fact , bmt may exist in an ordered trigonal structure ( @xmath9 ) modification  @xcite and it has been shown that this modification  @xcite mainly entails perfect periodic ordering of the b - site .",
    "the trigonal lattice is essentially a threefold superlattice of the cubic one , with extremely small geometric distortions , realized by stacking periodically a sequence of one mg plane and two ta planes orthogonally to one of the cubic @xmath10 directions .",
    "the atomic sites are also very close to those of the underlying cubic sublattice , with only small atomic displacements consistent with the reduced symmetry .",
    "it is noteworthy that the trigonal bmt superstructure - usually cast unto four equally populated domain orientations with the threefold axis along either of the cubic @xmath11 directions , so that the average symmetry is conserved - can be considered as a commensurate distortion of cubic bmt . in this framework",
    ", the modulation contributes eight additional ( @xmath12 ) satellite bragg peaks to the diffraction pattern , and these coincide with the vertices of the diffuse scattering cubes .",
    "another partial b - site ordering type of class iii ) has been observed  @xcite in other ab@xmath1b@xmath2o@xmath3 cubic perovskites ( pmt , with a = pb , b@xmath4ta , b@xmath5 mg ) . these have ( 1/2,1/2,1/2 ) satellites and correspond to a partial b - site ordering with a 2@xmath132@xmath132 @xmath14 superstructure unit cell .",
    "the b - sites are of two types , one of pure b@xmath8 and the other containing the rest of b@xmath8 and all of b@xmath7 cations , and the two b - site types arrange in a nacl - type structure that consists of two inter - penetrating fcc lattices .",
    "these satellites coincide now with the center of the diffuse scattering cubes observed for bmt .    diffuse scattering cubes straddle the reciprocal space location of the ( 1/2,1/2,1/2 ) satellites and the ( @xmath12 ) satellites identifying the two kinds of periodically ordered type iii ) b - site structures . although this diffuse scattering is not bragg - like , in a sense that will be specified in  sec .  [",
    "sec : smooth ] , this suggests that the diffuse cubes result from b - site ordering as well , possibly from a non - periodic order of type ii ) .",
    "we stress here that the observed cubes of diffuse intensity are not ideal , as careful inspection ( _ cf .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) shows that `` cubes '' have a minimum in the center about 10% lower than at the periphery and the corresponding intensity distribution is not a flat - top .",
    "we see in particular that intensity tends to increase near the vertices ( the ( @xmath12 ) satellites of the trigonal superstructure ) and decrease in the center - the ( 1/2,1/2,1/2 ) satellite of the hypothetical partly ordered nacl - type superstructure , indicating an embryo of transition to the trigonal phase .",
    "we must therefore consider the phase with idealized cubes as a limiting situation that may not be perfectly realized in our sample . as we argue in the following that the phase with ideal diffuse cubes is not the ground state at room temperature but only a metastable phase , kinetically hindered from transforming to the trigonal ground state , this is perfectly possible , as a germ of transition may have occurred due to finite quenching speed .",
    "however , in this framework , the limiting phase with ideal diffuse cubes is a key to understanding the b - site ordering phenomena in bmt , and therefore we will deal mainly with this phase .      as we are discussing the multiple phases of bmt",
    ", we should comment on an important point about phase stability . in the thermodynamic sense ,",
    "a stable structure observed in an experiment corresponds to a minimum of the free energy at the conditions of crystal formation . at ambient conditions",
    "the mg - ta distribution is quenched and experimentally observed configurations may not necessarily correspond to a true ground state .",
    "a disordered or incompletely ordered state can be stabilized at high temperature by a strong entropy term and could be a metastable state at lower t. in fact , at room temperature the diffusion of mg and ta is practically nonexistent , so that the non - ergodic effects in the scattering experiments can be neglected .",
    "if the first born approximation is valid and the scattering can be considered as elastic , the scattered intensity is the fourier transform of the scattering density s pair ( two - body ) correlation function  @xcite .",
    "the scattering density is the atomic structure , and for x - rays it is the sum of the single atom electron densities and the only degrees of freedom come from the spatial distribution ( structure ) of the atoms themselves .",
    "the pair correlation function ( crystallographers name it the `` patterson function '' ) is the information contained in the scattering pattern .",
    "a natural ambiguity arises in the relationship between the atomic structure and the pair correlation function , as there may be many atomic structures that have the same pair correlation function  @xcite . in some cases ,",
    "this is not an accidental degeneracy .",
    "when the internal energy @xmath15 depends only on the pairwise interactions , different structures with identical pair correlation functions are isoenergetic . at any finite temperature @xmath16 ,",
    "the multiplicity of configurations increases the entropy @xmath17 and this in turn decreases the free energy , @xmath18 , to the advantage of the stability of the ( statistically defined ) structure .",
    "we intend to show that the b - site order in bmt , that gives rise to the cubes of the diffuse intensity belongs to this case , based on the fact that pair ( electrostatic ) interactions between the b cations are sufficient to explain the phase diagram of the different bmt phases which derive from the ordering of b - sites .",
    "the pair ( two - body ) and the set of the higher order ( many - body ) correlation functions can fully describe any structure in an unambiguous way , including stochastically defined ones  @xcite . considering higher order correlation functions is necessary , however , only when they make important contributions to the internal energy .",
    "this is sometimes the case , for instance , for structures that show displacive diffuse scattering  @xcite . in any case , higher correlation functions are also a way of _ describing _ a structure in the crystal - chemical sense .",
    "this is especially convenient when the structure itself can not be easily represented because it is only statistically defined . however , simpler ways of presenting the crystal - chemical informations are also possible , see  sec .",
    "[ mcsol ] .",
    "our approach is as follows .",
    "the pair correlation function that is related to the diffuse cubes can be simply analyzed in terms of the b - site chemical order as a site concentration pair correlation function  @xcite .",
    "this turns out to have a simple analytical form that shows a rather peculiar power - law decrease with distance that is observed in only a few cases for rather exotic systems .",
    "monte - carlo simulations were performed for a large scale in order to find the b - site configurations that give the same pair correlation as the diffuse intensity .",
    "successfully determined configurations were then analyzed in terms of a long - range order parameter showing that these partially ordered configurations that are compatible with the observed scattering phenomena are not distinguishable from completely disordered systems .",
    "next , we consider that bmt is an ionic compound and that the electrostatic energy is the main term in the crystal hamiltonian .",
    "the electrostatic energy of a rigid system depends only on pair interactions and the electrostatic energies and the entropy terms for the different bmt phases were calculated .",
    "these gave a good correspondence with the observed phase diagram , confirming that the cubic phase must be a high - temperature ground state of bmt that is metastable at room temperature .",
    "the single crystals of bmt were synthesized according to the procedure described by galasso and pinto  @xcite .",
    "the powder of bmt was prepared according to two - stage synthesis described in ref .",
    "@xcite and is essentially the same as used in the neutron diffraction study  @xcite .",
    "the experiments were performed on x - ray scattering instruments at the esrf and sls . at the esrf the diffuse scattering from bmt was measured at the swiss - norwegian beam line ( snbl ) and the xmas beamline , and at the sls the measurements were made at the beamline x06sa .",
    "more details of the measurements and the experimental results for bmt are given in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on the unusual diffuse scattering observed from bmt and typical results are shown in fig .",
    "similar results were obtained from the sls diffractometer x06sa , but from the xmas data the scattering contained sharp peaks at the ( h+1/3 , k+1/3,l+1/3 ) positions showing the structure was trigonal .",
    "a bmt powder sample was also studied at the sls on the beamline x04sa .",
    "it was revealed that the trigonal satellites were significantly broader than the intense peaks of the cubic phase showing that the domain size was about 20 nm for the trigonal structure .",
    "these results support the suggestion that our powder and the surfaces of relatively large bmt crystals consist to some extent of trigonal - structured domains while the bulk of crystals is cubic and shows the diffuse scattering of fig .",

    "it is suggested that the structures are unable to relax when rapidly cooled from high temperature .",

    "the a cation ( ba ) is located within the unit cell in ( 1/2,1/2,1/2 ) , the mixed b - site is in ( 0,0,0 ) and the three oxygens occupy the ( 0,1/2,1/2 ) , ( 1/2,0,1/2 ) , ( 1/2,1/2,0 ) positions .",
    "in this section a simple mathematical model of the diffuse intensity is described .",
    "the model is simple because each atom is assumed to be a point scatterer , with element xx having a constant scattering length @xmath23 .",
    "this means neglecting the atomic form factors and debye - waller factors , whose effect is just a smooth decay of the intensity at large transferred momentum values .",
    "the scattering from bmt has diffuse scattering cubes centered at @xmath24 with half - side 1/3 ( all in rlu ) .",
    "a simple mathematical description of their shape can be given as follows .",
    "in one dimension , define a box function @xmath25    then a periodic sequence of such boxes centered on the half - integers is @xmath26 multiplying three such terms ( one for each coordinate ) and adding a constant background ( that we will show to be necessary ) we obtain a model of the x - ray diffuse intensity : @xmath27 here @xmath28 is the halfwidth of the observed cubes in reciprocal lattice units . taking the fourier transform of the periodic array of cubes of x - ray diffuse intensity @xmath29 ( eqs .",

    "we shall name qlrco ( as quasi - long - range cation order ) the kind of order exhibited by the bmt sample .",

    "we obtain ( see sec .  [",

    "[ chem : sro ] ) that both long- and short - range parameters indicate a substantial degree of order , which is an unusual occurrence .",
    "the model of the diffuse intensity described above can be improved in one significant aspect .",
    "the cubes as observed are not perfect , as there are intensity fluctuations within them .",
    "their edges , especially , are not very sharply defined .",
    "this effect can be included by convoluting @xmath42 with a point - spread function ( psf ) @xmath43 .",
    "accordingly , the pair correlation function @xmath44 is multiplied by the fourier transform of the psf , @xmath45 as shown in fig .  [ fig3 ] .",
    "the latter will be named here the _ correlation decay function _ ( cdf ) .",
    "this will give a stronger decay law for the pair correlation function .",
    "this is just what happens with every known diffraction phenomenon - as far as infinite crystals do not exist , even the most perfect standard crystal will show bragg peaks convoluted by a suitable psf and pair correlations damped by the corresponding cdf .",
    "we will not , in the following , burden the notation by including a psf , but we will calculate some of its effects in sec .",
    "[ eesec ] .",

    "this is well below the coherent domain size , however it remains a considerable distance when dealing with diffuse scattering .",
    "as the psf @xmath43 is convoluted with the scattered intensity , the cdf @xmath45 is multiplied by the pair correlation function , that is the fourier transform of the intensity .",
    "its effect is then to limit the spatial extension of the pair correlation function .",
    "this is a familiar issue in crystallography .",
    "crystal size can be estimated from the broadening of the bragg peaks , due to the limited extension of the crystal - and , in turn , of the pair correlation function .",
    "we wish to remark here that the cube scattering is quite different from bragg scattering with respect to its response to a limitation of correlation length .",
    "in fact , convoluting the psf with a bragg peak gives the psf itself .",
    "this is the reason for the familiar behaviour of bragg peaks - namely , that their width is inversely proportional to the size of the correlated domain ( a good estimate of this is @xmath50 ) .",
    "the diffuse cubes , however , show a negligible change in width , second - order or more in @xmath51 .",
    "this scattering form is therefore fundamentally different from bragg scattering .",
    "to explain such diffuse scattering in terms of b - site cation order we split the scattering density @xmath52 as @xmath53 with @xmath54 the periodic average and @xmath55 a non - periodic zero - average fluctuation . if the b site is the only one that varies , all of ba and o partial densities are included in @xmath54 . as already mentioned , we simplify the picture by considering point - like atoms .",
    "then @xmath56 is zero everywhere except on the b sites , and for b = ta @xmath57 ; for b = mg @xmath58 .",
    "if @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the scattering lengths of mg and ta , respectively , then @xmath61    as @xmath55 assumes only two values ( @xmath62 on ta sites and @xmath63 on mg sites ) we can consider ( see  @xcite ) the site concentration of one of the two species , say mg , in each lattice node .",
    "clearly this can be only 0 or 1 .",
    "we indicate it with @xmath64 , that is 1 if site @xmath65 is occupied by mg and 0 otherwise .",
    "similarly we take @xmath66 as the ta local concentration , that is 1 if site @xmath65 occupied by ta and 0 otherwise . as we have no vacancies , @xmath67 .",
    "averaging over all sites , we have @xmath68 furthermore , as @xmath69 and @xmath70 can be only 0 or 1 , @xmath71 so the r.m.s",
    ". fluctuation of the concentration is given by @xmath72 the fluctuation of the density is given by @xmath73      in order to study the diffuse scattering from bmt , we need to evaluate the pair correlation function of @xmath55 : @xmath74 here @xmath75 is the crystal volume , @xmath76 the number of lattice nodes within it , @xmath77 the unit cell volume ( taken as 1 hereafter , hence the last equality ) .",
    "we shall equate this to the pair correlation function derived from the data , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : corr ] ) .",
    "the rightmost form is because @xmath55 is a weighted dirac lattice , and this property is invariant upon self - convolution .",
    "this is the same form as eq .",
    "( [ eq : corr ] ) , so clearly now we have to calculate the @xmath34 pair correlation coefficients for a given fluctuation density ( eq .  ( [ flucden ] ) ) and to compare them with those obtained from the fourier transform of the data ( eqs .",
    "( [ eq : corr1],[eq : corr2 ] ) ) .    substituting eq .",
    "( [ flucden ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq : gdelta ] ) gives @xmath78 where , comparing with eq .",

    "( [ eq : corr1 ] ) - implies @xmath92 which tells us that a consistent fraction - at least about 40% - of the diffuse intensity must be spread as a constant background while the rest forms the diffuse cubes .",
    "this is also a lower bound only , so possibly the background fraction is even larger .      in eqs .",
    "( [ pmgmg],[pother ] ) we have calculated the probability of finding pairs of atoms of equal or different species ( limited to the b sublattice ) for each separation vector @xmath80 . that is all we need to calculate the electrostatic energy .",
    "in fact , the structure consists of the fixed part ( the a sublattice and the oxygen sublattices ) and the variable part ( the b sublattice ) .",
    "a result of ref .",
    "@xcite is that the electrostatic energy does not depend on the interaction terms between the different sublattices ; the fixed part then has no influence except for a constant term and one needs to calculate only the interactions between atoms of the b sublattice .",
    "similarly to the scattering density ( eq .  ( [ eq : flu ] ) ) , we can separate the charge density @xmath93 into the the average part and fluctuating part @xmath94 with @xmath95 the average component and @xmath96 a non - periodic zero - average fluctuation . again , on ta - occupied sites we will have @xmath97 and on mg sites ,",
