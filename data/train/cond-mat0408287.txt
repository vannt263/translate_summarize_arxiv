    "in the last few years , a large number of studies has been devoted to the realization of qubits using josephson devices  @xcite .",
    "a single superconducting qubit can be realized using either charge or flux degrees of freedom .",
    "the flux josephson two - state system is based on two quantum states carrying opposite persistent currents .",
    "coherent time evolution between these states has been recently observed  @xcite . at present , however , no quantum oscillations between two coupled flux qubits has been reported . in charge",
    "josephson qubits the relevant degree of freedom is the charge on superconducting grains .",
    "the coherent control of macroscopic quantum states in a single cooper - pair box has been demonstrated  @xcite , while the first observation of coherent quantum oscillations in two coupled charge qubits has been reported  @xcite .",
    "moreover , coherent oscillations have been observed in other superconducting devices  @xcite .",
    "while longer coherence times are desirable , these experiments show that the superconducting circuits are strong candidates for solid - state qubits .",
    "the next major step toward building a josephson - junction based quantum computer is to experimentally realize simple quantum algorithms , such as the creation of an entangled state involving more than two coupled qubits .",
    "a typical design of a cooper pair box consists of a small superconducting island with @xmath0 cooper pair charges connected by a tunnel junction with a josephson coupling energy @xmath1 and the capacitance @xmath2 to a superconducting electrode  @xcite . a control gate voltage @xmath3 is coupled to the system via a gate capacitor @xmath4 .",
    "the energy of the @xmath0 cooper pairs in the box is @xmath5 , where @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is the electron charge . considering later",
    "@xmath0 as one of the canonical variables , and neglecting the constant term , we can represent @xmath8 in the form @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the gate charge ( in units of @xmath11 ) .",
    "when @xmath12 , by choosing @xmath13 close to the degeneracy point , @xmath14 , only the states with @xmath0 and @xmath15 cooper pairs play a role . in this case , the effective hamiltonian of the two - state system can be written in the spin-@xmath16 notation as @xmath17 where the state with @xmath0 cooper pairs corresponds to the spin state @xmath18 and the state with @xmath15 cooper pairs corresponds to the spin state @xmath19 ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) ; @xmath20 and @xmath21 are , respectively , the @xmath22 and @xmath23 - components of spin-@xmath16 operator ; @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the effective magnetic fields which are controlled by the applied gate voltage and the magnetic flux .",
    "[ see eqs .",
    "( [ bzbx ] ) below . ]    the hamiltonian of an array of coupled superconducting qubits can be written in the general form @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the number of qubits in the circuit .",
    "the explicit form of the coefficients @xmath29 in ( [ many_spins_hamiltonian ] ) depends on the particular way in which the inter - qubit coupling is implemented .",
    "a variety of possible architectures to couple charge josephson qubits has been proposed  @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested  @xcite to realize a coupling of the type @xmath30 using an inductor : all qubits were connected in parallel to an lc - oscillator which provided the two - qubit interaction .",
    "a possible limitation of this architecture is that the inter - qubit coupling term is valid only under the conditions that the phase conjugate to the total charge on the qubit capacitors fluctuates weakly , and that the eigenfrequency @xmath31 of the lc circuit is much larger than the typical frequencies of the qubit dynamics .",
    "since @xmath32 scales with the number @xmath28 of qubits as @xmath33 , this limits the maximum number of qubits in the quantum register .",
    "a different proposed type of the inter - qubit coupling uses the coulomb interaction between charges on the islands of the charge qubits  @xcite : this gives a coupling @xmath34 .",
    "a drawback of this approach is that one can not switch the inter - qubit coupling in this scheme without introducing unwanted dephasing effects .",
    "another proposed architecture employs two additional squids to connect each qubit : all josephson charge qubits are coupled through a common superconducting inductance , and the resulting coupling is @xmath35  @xcite . the same coupling of charge qubits can also be realized using mutual inductance  @xcite .",
    "finally , we mention that another experimental realization of a single superconducting charge qubit has been obtained using the current - biased josephson junctions  @xcite . a quantum computer architecture based on two capacitively",
    "coupled current - biased josephson junctions was discussed before  @xcite .    in this paper , we consider capacitively coupled squids , which currently are the only experimental setup that has provided an experimental detection of quantum oscillations in two coupled charge qubits  @xcite . in this architecture ,",
    "the squids are connected via a constant capacitor , and the coupling is of the form @xmath36 . varying the magnetic flux @xmath37 through the squids allows one to control the josephson energy @xmath1 , which is equivalent to controlling the effective magnetic field @xmath38  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we will assume that it is possible to have the josephson energies [ _ i.e. _ , @xmath39 coefficients in eq.([many_spins_hamiltonian ] ) ] independently and locally variable in time .",
    "we note that experimentally the fast independent manipulation of gate voltages is possible  @xcite . at the same time , the fast independent control of magnetic fluxes through the different squids with the distance @xmath40 m between them and the switching time @xmath41  ns represents a challenge to the present - day technology . as an alternative",
    ", the @xmath38 field can be manipulated by using recently proposed  @xcite nb / alo@xmath42nb - al / alo@xmath42/nb stacked josephson junctions instead of squids . in the double josephson junction device ,",
    "injection current @xmath43 ( of the order of several ma ) in the control junction induces variation of the josephson critical current @xmath44 ( of the order of several @xmath45a ) . as for a single josephson junction @xmath46 ( @xmath47 is the flux quantum ,",

    "however , for @xmath86 the off - diagonal elements of @xmath70 decay exponentially as @xmath87 , so that the influence of the long - range interaction can be reduced by taking the coupling capacitances @xmath88 to be much smaller than the on - site capacitances @xmath89 .",

    "we now make some remarks concerning the specific field configuration that we chose in this paper for implementation of quantum logic .",
    "first , all qubits are initially placed in a permanent static @xmath210 field , @xmath327 created by static voltages @xmath278 and the inter - qubit interaction . before a flip of the @xmath201th qubit by a @xmath38 pulse , the voltage applied to this qubit is switched to the resonant value , and after the @xmath38-pulse this voltage is switched to its initial value . as follows from the results of this paper , the nonzero static @xmath328 field introduces an additional parameter , or degree of freedom : by changing this field it is possible to control the phase of the wave function .    the qubit rotations are implemented by the rectangular @xmath204-pulses because during implementation of these pulses the effective @xmath226 field in the location of the @xmath201th qubit is not equal to zero for some quantum states of the superposition .",
    "that is why the result of the action of a @xmath38-pulse on the states with nonzero @xmath226 field depends on the form of this pulse .",
    "the analytic solution is known for a rectangular pulse , so the rectangular form of the @xmath204-pulse is the simplest possible choice that allows one to analyze the basic properties of the system and optimize the parameters of the pulses .",
    "the interaction representation used in this paper for modeling of quantum logic is employed because it effectively eliminates from consideration free quantum dynamics of the quantum states of the superposition .",
    "namely , since different states of the superposition have different energies @xmath329 , they acquire different phase factors even in the case when the applied fields are not changed .",
    "the interaction representation allows one to choose the static voltages @xmath330 arbitrarily . in particular",
    ", one can choose @xmath282 .",
    "( see , for example , fig . 2 of this paper . ) if @xmath331 , this would allow one to decrease the decoherence effect of the gate because the gate voltage is switched on and off only during the logic operation on a specific qubit .",
    "also the time between the pulses can be chosen arbitrarily because the wave amplitudes in the interaction representation are not changed during this time .",
    "for two states in the register , the system with long - range interaction between qubits is exactly solvable .",
    "however , the universal quantum computation involving an arbitrary possible number of states in the quantum register is supposed to be implemented by taking into consideration only nearest neighbor interaction .",
    "the long - range interaction in the general case results in generation of error states .",
    "these errors are small only when the value of @xmath90 , characterizing the coupling strength , is small . for example , the value @xmath173 can be considered as large because the long - range interaction produces the error of the order @xmath173 in the probability amplitude and phase of the wave function . in order to show this ,",
