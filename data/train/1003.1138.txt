    "the fate of quarkonium states such as @xmath0 in the quark - gluon plasma has been a subject of continuous interest for both theorists and experimentalists since the famous proposal  @xcite to use the suppression of @xmath0 production in heavy - ion collisions as a signature of the quark - gluon plasma formation .",
    "the screening of color forces should weaken or prevent @xmath4 pair binding , manifesting in @xmath0 suppression in heavy - ion collisions capable of creating quark - gluon plasma . making detailed predictions for this effect",
    "is a formidable challenge , requiring understanding of such factors as @xmath4 pair production , binding , and survival of charmonium states in medium , as well as their interplay in the dynamically evolving high energy density medium ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for review ) .",
    "a field - theoretical quantity which encodes much , but certainly not all , information necessary in this regard is the spectral function of the operator of charm current , @xmath5 .",
    "this operator , acting on the vacuum state , produces charmonium @xmath6 states such as @xmath0 , @xmath1 , etc . by studying the response of the thermal medium to the action of such an operator we can learn about the fate of the charmonium states in this medium .",
    "the dissociation , or `` melting '' , of the charmonium states manifests itself in the gradual decrease with temperature of the strength of the response at the frequencies at which the vacuum state would `` resonate '' by creating a charmonium bound state .",
    "the current - current correlator and its spectral function are field - theoretically well - defined quantities , interesting in their own right .",
    "they can be , in principle , calculated using _ ab initio _",
    "lattice monte carlo approach .",
    "the task of extracting the charmonium spectral functions from discrete euclidean correlators measured on the lattice is difficult , but significant progress has been made recently using the maximum entropy method ( mem )  @xcite .",
    "the spectral peak corresponding to the @xmath0 state appears to be still prominent up to temperatures as high as almost 2.5 @xmath3 , where @xmath7 mev ( see , e.g , ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) is the critical / crossover temperature at which the thermal qcd medium undergoes deconfining transition . to understand lattice results better ,",
    "it is very desirable to have analytically controllable models which could allow us to study the `` melting '' of the quarkonium spectral peak .",
    "the models based on a non - relativistic schrdinger potential have been traditionally used for this purpose . in the pioneering work of ref .",
    "@xcite , the effective temperature - dependent potential was modeled by introducing debye screening into the linearly confining potential .",
    "the recently studied models have used a non - relativistic schrdinger potential , whose dependence on temperature is introduced either by input from the lattice  @xcite , or resummation - improved perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "the non - relativistic thermal potential models typically predict charmonium dissociation at temperatures approximately 1.21.5 @xmath3 @xcite , which appear to be too low compared to the dissociation temperatures inferred from the lattice .",
    "several possible resolutions of this puzzle have been proposed ( as reviewed , e.g. , in refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "gauge - gravity holographic correspondence  @xcite provides a new field - theoretically consistent framework for modeling the properties of thermal strongly - coupled medium ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "although _ ab initio _ calculations in qcd - proper are still not possible within this approach , many properties of qcd , both in vacuum and at finite temperature can be modeled .",
    "`` top - down '' reduction of string theory on suitably chosen backgrounds allows one to study qcd - like field theories , such as theories with flavored matter in fundamental color representation  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , reversing the rules of the holographic correspondence one can build `` bottom - up '' models by matching the relevant features of qcd , such as chiral symmetry breaking , operator product expansion constraints on correlators and linear confinement  @xcite .",
    "the fate of meson states in strongly coupled thermal medium has been a subject of many studies  @xcite using a `` top - down '' approach to implementing massive flavor degrees of freedom introduced in refs .",
    "spectral functions and quasinormal modes were studied in refs .",
    "structure of quarkonium in these theories was also studied in  @xcite .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that reproducing the charmonium spectrum correctly is an important prerequisite for predicting its finite temperature properties .",
    "one important way in which the spectrum of heavy quarkonium excitations in `` top - down '' models differs from qcd is that in these models the lowest meson mass @xmath8 emerges as the only scale determining the masses of both the ground state and the excited mesons @xcite : @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "in contrast , in the heavy quark limit of qcd , the mass of the ground state , such as @xmath0 , is controlled by a parameter ( heavy quark mass ) different from the parameter ( string tension , or @xmath11 ) controlling the level spacing of excited states : @xmath12 ,  refs .",
    "it would be interesting to find a holographic model which could represent these features of quarkonium spectrum correctly .",
    "in this paper , we shall approach this problem from the complementary side of the `` top - down '' models . taking the quarkonium properties at zero temperature as input",
    ", we shall construct the holographic dual which matches these properties in the spirit of the `` bottom - up '' approach of refs .",
    "then we shall study how such a model would evolve with temperature .",
    "the pioneering calculation of the @xmath0 spectral functions within such an approach has been performed in ref .",
    "building on the success of the `` bottom - up '' models for _ light _",
    "mesons  @xcite the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite changed the scale in the `` soft - wall '' model of ref .",
    "@xcite to match the mass of @xmath0 meson , in place of the @xmath13 meson .",
    "however , such an approach suffers from the drawback already discussed above for the `` top - down '' models : the scale that sets the level spacing of quarkonium excited states is the same as the scale that sets the mass of the ground state , in effect @xmath14 in the models of refs .",
    "what we would like instead is a spectrum which has a gap between the vacuum and the ground state whose scale is set by a parameter independent from the spacing of higher excited levels .",
    "experimentally , the slope of the radial excitation trajectory for @xmath0 is similar to that of the @xmath13 mesons  @xcite , and we want the model to match that property of qcd .",
    "the matching of the quarkonium mass spectrum is not the only new ingredient which we need to introduce .",
    "we point out that another important quantity to be matched is the _ decay constant _ of the quarkonium .",
    "simply put , in order for the spectral function to be correct at high temperature , we should begin with a function correct at zero temperature , which requires matching not only the position , but also the strength of the @xmath0 resonance , _",
    "i.e. _ the decay constant",
    ".    one of the most striking qualitative consequences of such a more realistic model of quarkonium is a much more robust spectral peak of @xmath0 , which persists up to temperature 540 mev , i.e. , 2.8 @xmath3 , in agreement with lattice studies .",
    "this is in contrast to ref .",
    "@xcite which finds charmonium peak `` melting '' at around 1.2 @xmath3 .",
    "we take better agreement of our results with the lattice calculations as evidence that the model we introduce captures essential features of quarkonium .    in section  [ sec : setup ] , to make the paper more self - contained , we lay out the general setup of the holographic model .",
    "section  [ sec : hologr - potent ] discusses the features of the holographic potential we introduce to model charmonium .",

    "the finite temperature spectral functions obtained using the proposed new holographic potential are presented in section  [ sec : results ] . in section  [ sec : qnm ] , we further our study of the thermal properties of charmonium by considering quasinormal modes . to facilitate this analysis , in section",
    "[ sec : residue ] , we generalize the quantitative relation between the holographic wave - function and the residue at the corresponding singularity of the 2-point correlator ( i.e. , decay constant ) to the case of quasinormal modes at nonzero temperature .",
    "interestingly , this relationship is the same as the known one in vacuum , after the quasinormal mode is appropriately normalized .",
    "we derive the expression for such a norm in section  [ sec : residue ] . in section  [ sec : analysis ] , we use the quasinormal modes and the residues to analyze the charmonium spectral function more quantitatively .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : disc ] with a summary and a discussion of the results .",

    "this allows us to study not only the _ position _ of the pole in the complex plane , corresponding to the quasinormal mode , but also the _ strength _ of the contribution of this pole to the spectral function .",
    "in particular , this allows us to devise a simple quantitative criterion for the disappearance of the peak based on its height relative to the asymptotic level of the background . since the dissociation of quarkonium and disappearance of the peak is not a sharp transition , a criterion of this type might find its use in comparing results of different approaches in a more uniform and objective way .    finally , we find that the new features of the holographic potential , such as the `` dip '' , which we introduce to model quarkonium more realistically , strengthen the robustness of the @xmath0 peak , allowing it to persist out to temperatures of about 540 mev , i.e. , 2.8 @xmath3 , according to our criterion .",

    "<S> we calculate the spectral function as well as the position of the complex singularities ( quasinormal frequencies ) of the retarded correlator of the charm current at finite temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> we further extend this analysis by showing that the residues associated with these singularities are given by the boundary derivative of the appropriately normalized quasinormal mode . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the `` melting '' of the @xmath0 spectral peak occurs at a temperature @xmath2 mev , or 2.8 @xmath3 , in good agreement with lattice results . </S>"
