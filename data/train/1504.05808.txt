    "the stellar luminosity function ( hereafter lf ) , i.e.  the inventory of stars as a function of their absolute magnitudes , is a fundamental property of a stellar population , and has wide implications for understanding star formation , and the formation and evolution of galaxies . at present",
    ", we can determine a complete lf on a star - by - star basis , down to the hydrogen burning limit , for stars in the milky way only .",
    "such lfs have been determined for stars in the solar neighbourhood , and also for open clusters , globular clusters and in the galactic bulge .",
    "conventionally , the lf refers to luminosities of the stars in the optical bands , such as the @xmath8band .",
    "one of the most influential determinations of the nearby lf is that of @xcite , who based the study on the catalogue of nearby stars @xcite , an extensive compilation of data on all stars within 22pc of the sun .",
    "more recently , @xcite have re - determined the lf using modern data , including in particular the _ hipparcos _ data @xcite , but finding only small corrections to the classic work .",
    "those authors determined not only local star number densities ( as in * ? ? ? * ) , but also derived surface densities of stars ( i.e.  in a column integrated through the galactic disc ) as a function of absolute magnitude . in surface density terms , light from the milky way disc was found to be dominated by emission from main sequence stars with @xmath9mag ( spectral type a ) and by old k- and m - giants with @xmath10mag @xcite .    for the analysis of the dynamics and evolution of galaxies ,",
    "it is necessary to determine the masses of the galactic components . from population synthesis",
    "it is obvious that the mass - to - light ratio ( hereafter @xmath11 , in solar units ) in the optical is very sensitive to the contribution of very young stellar populations and thus the recent star formation due to the dominating light of o and b stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* for the dependence of @xmath11 on the star formation timescale in different bands ) .",
    "additionally , dust attenuation reduces the observed light in the optical bands significantly at least in late type galaxies and in the milky way .",
    "as is well known , the analysis of galactic rotation curves suffers greatly from the uncertainty in @xmath12 of the stellar disc . for extragalactic systems this is usually done by adopting or fitting a reasonable @xmath11 value of the components . in a new approach",
    "@xcite used dynamic disc masses derived by a combination of integral field spectroscopy and a statistical scale height determination to derive @xmath13 as a function of galactocentric radius for a set of galaxies .    with the increasing number of spatially resolved observations in the near infrared bands ( hereafter nir ) , nir luminosities are increasingly used for disc mass determinations , primarily in the k band",
    "the variation of @xmath13 for different stellar populations is much smaller than in the optical bands and the extinction is smaller by a factor of 10 compared to the @xmath8 band . recently near- and far- infrared observations are used to determine disc masses of extragalactic systems ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "but there is still no direct method to determine for the same galaxy the surface mass density and the surface brightness independently . another particular purpose of using @xmath13 is to construct models of the milky way s structure as constrained by star counts in the nir in various galactic fields and nir luminosity functions have been measured in many studies , e.g. @xcite to probe the galaxy s structure .",
    "star count methods are more tractable in the nir because of the greatly reduced extinction compared to optical . a local kband lf for main sequence stars can also be obtained by converting the optically determined lf to the nir using @xmath14 colours averaged over magnitude bins , as in @xcite , but the total brightness in the kband is dominated by giants .",
    "it is expected that observations in the nir are better suited than those in the optical bands to track the distribution of stars , especially to probe directly the mass - carrying population of late - type main sequence stars ( g , k , and m dwarfs ) . since the solar neighbourhood is the only place where we can determine directly both the luminosity and the stellar mass density , it is worthwhile to investigate the properties of @xmath13 based on the best available data for this part of the galaxy .    in this paper",
    "we present a fresh ` ab - initio ' determination of the milky way lf in the nir ( we use the @xmath15 filter , 2.2@xmath16 m , throughout the paper but skip the index s for clarity ) .",
    "our study is primarily based on _ hipparcos _ stars and at the faint end on nir data to be included in the up - coming fifth edition of the catalogue of nearby stars ( cns5 ; just et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "these data have been obtained by identifying the cns5 stars in the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass * ? ? ?",
    "the data set drawn from the cns5 is augmented by samples of stars selected from the _ hipparcos _ catalogue , for which 2mass data is also available .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section [ datsamp ]",
    "we describe the construction of our data set and discuss its statistical completeness . in section [ lumfunc ]",
    "we derive the kband lf and investigate its implications .",
    "we determine the contributions by the stars in the various absolute magnitude bins to the luminosity and mass budgets of the milky way disc in the local volume and in the solar cylinder , the principal result being that even in the nir the light is dominated by early type main sequence stars and late giants .",
    "the consequences of this finding and our conclusions are summarized in the last section ( [ conc ] ) .",
    "we have constructed our stellar sample by merging two data subsets , in order to probe the bright and faint ends of the lf respectively . for the bright end of the lf",
    "we have extracted samples of stars from the revised _ hipparcos _",
    "catalogue @xcite , using criteria of absolute magnitude @xmath17 and the parallax limits summarized in columns 1 and 2 of table [ tab1 ] .",
    "the first three subsamples fall into the survey part of the _ hipparcos _ catalogue and are thus volume complete by construction . for the last subgroup ( @xmath18 25pc )",
    ", we sampled to apparent magnitude @xmath19mag , based on the determination by @xcite that the _ hipparcos _ catalogue is complete down to absolute magnitude @xmath17 = 8.3mag .",
    "the numbers of stars in each subgroup are tabulated in the fourth column of table [ tab1 ] .",
    "stars with relative parallax errors larger than 15 per cent were excluded ( except antares , see below ) .",
    "the numbers of removed stars are also given in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "the vast majority of all the sample stars were then matched to sources in the 2mass catalogue and their absolute @xmath20 magnitudes and @xmath14 colour were derived .",
    "only 10 stars did not appear in 2mass : for these stars , @xmath21magnitudes were found in the literature or estimated from their known spectral types using the relation of @xcite . since the nominal errors for the brightest stars in 2mass are of the order of 0.2mag , we have compared the 2mass magnitudes with literature values .",
    "we find that the differences between 2mass and literature values are so small that they can be ignored for our purposes .",
    "the resulting sample of _ hipparcos _ stars is illustrated as a colour - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) in fig .",
    "it is complete to @xmath20 @xmath22 4mag with respect to the @xmath8 band volumes and will be used down to the @xmath23mag bin .",
    "note that the discontinuities in the cmd reflect poisson statistics , because the subgroups cover significantly different volumes .",
    "for the analysis we split the stars brighter than @xmath24mag into giants and dwarfs by the dividing line @xmath25 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the resulting sample sizes are also given in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "the removal of stars with poor parallaxes ( i.e.  parallax errors @xmath26 per cent ) means that we lose some stars which could significantly contribute to the total luminosity , in particular at the sparse , bright end of the lf .",
    "the brightest among the excluded stars are the m1.5iab supergiant @xmath27 sco a ` antares ' ( parallax @xmath28mas , @xmath29mag ) , the m3iii giant hip12086 ( @xmath30mas , @xmath31mag ) , and the k0iii giant hip61418 ( @xmath32mas , @xmath33mag ) .",
    "we add antares to our sample , because its inclusion corresponds to a factor of two in the star number in the @xmath34mag bin and it adds 7 per cent to the total local luminosity .",
    "the contribution of all other stars is below 2 per cent and is therefore not taken into account .",

    "since we derive distances and also base our absolute magnitudes on _ hipparcos _ parallaxes the associated error ( which we assume to be gaussian ) can affect our sample selection .",
    "the skewed error distribution after inverting parallaxes to distances results in the so called _ parallax bias _",
    "@xcite leading to larger mean distances .",
    "another effect of the parallax error arising from the volume limit of the sample , but of opposite sign , is the trumpler - weaver or lutz - kelker bias @xcite which increases star counts as the error volume outside our limiting distance is larger than inside and more stars should scatter in . in the literature these biases are often corrected statistically but it was shown that the lutz - kelker correction depends strongly on the adopted spatial distribution of the sample ( usually a homogeneous density is assumed ) and the true absolute magnitude distribution ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the latter may be well defined for special stellar types like red clump giants or cepheids . in our case for the bright hipparcos stars there is no simple way to calculate the lutz - kelker correction due to the wide spread in luminosities and stellar types . in order to assess the impact of these biases on our star counts we select all stars in the _ hipparcos _ catalogue .",
    "we sample the parallax of each star 100 times randomly as a gaussian with the mean of the original star s observed parallax and the standard deviation of its associated error .",
    "then we perform the same cuts as before , divide the counts by 100 and compare them to our sample .",
    "the 40pc sample decreases by 1 per cent , the 100pc sample increases by 2 per cent , and the 200pc sample decreases by 2 per cent . relaxing",
    "the parallax error cuts yield similar corrections . in effect",
    "the corrections are small and show no clear trend in star counts as well as in the luminosity function so that we can safely neglect them .",
    "a more severe source of error is dust extinction close to the galactic plane . due to missing 3d maps of the highly inhomogeneous dust distribution in the solar neighbourhood we can not correct for this error and only give rough estimates on its magnitude . for that we use the analytic extinction model from @xcite based on @xcite which gives a good estimate for the mean extinction .",
    "it represents a slab of constant dust density up to a distance of 55pc from the midplane with a hole at the solar position representing the local bubble .",
    "the resulting extinction vanishes for stars closer than 70pc ( inside the local bubble ) and at galactic latitudes @xmath42 .",
    "the extinction reaches its maximum of about @xmath43mag at the limiting distance of 200pc in the galactic plane . applying the same procedure as before but now also correcting for extinction nothing changes for the 40pc sample . for the 100pc and 200pc samples the star counts increase by 2.4 per cent and 6.6 per cent , respectively",
    "overall , neglecting extinction leads to a slightly underestimated luminosity function for bright stars with @xmath44mag . this bias is stronger for dwarfs at the upper main sequence , because of their stronger concentration to the midplane . on the other hand the derived luminosity distribution and total brightness in the k band",
    "is dominated by giants , which have a larger scale height and therefore being less obscured by extinction .",
    "the faint end of the lf has been determined using an updated version of the fourth catalogue of nearby stars ( hereafter cns5 , in prep . ;",
    "cns4 , * ? ? ?",
    "all cns5 stars within 25pc were cross matched with the 2mass catalogue",
    ". from the 4622 cns5 stars within 25 pc 135 stars got k - magnitudes from other sources .",
    "only 6 close binaries were removed at all as well as 9 brown dwarfs and one white dwarf below the magnitude limit of the 2mass survey . for the missing stars , @xmath21-magnitudes were obtained from the literature , from spectral types , or applying an @xmath45(@xmath46 ) relation based on cns5 stars with accurate parallaxes and reliable colours .",

    "our _ hipparcos _ samples are volume complete by construction . but beyond about@xmath48pc perpendicular to the galactic plane , stellar densities decline with increasing distance from the plane , and lead to significant correction factors converting the mean luminosity density in the observed volume to the local luminosity density at the galactic midplane .",
    "it can be easily shown that the impact of a ( distance dependent ) incompleteness , if present , on the cumulative number of stars @xmath49 as function of @xmath50 is mainly an apparently reduced local density @xmath51 , but the shape @xmath52 is essentially unaffected .",
    "we thus use @xmath49 to determine the vertical density profiles and correct for the local volume density at the midplane for the @xmath53100pc and the 200pc samples , separately for both giant and dwarf stars . within a sphere of radius @xmath54 , a constant density is obtained if the cumulative number of stars @xmath49 follows the relation @xmath55 ( grey dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ fig3n ] ) .",
    "we tested different vertical density profiles ( linear , exponential with and without a shallow core or gaussian ) and investigated the impact of an offset of the solar position @xmath56 from the midplane .",
    "it turns out that the profiles of the dwarfs in both samples can be better fit with @xmath57pc .    for the 200pc sample ,",
    "the cumulative star counts deviate significantly from the constant density fit of the inner 80 and 50pc for giants and dwarfs , respectively , which yields a local number density of @xmath58 for the giants and 1 per cent less for the dwarfs .",

    "our faint star counts are based on the cns5 and suffer from incompleteness , which we assume to depend on distance only .",

    "the reason for the luminosity of the present day giants  dominating the light in the k band  being a rough measure of stellar mass , carried by f , g , and k stars of the lower main sequence , is the similarity of their age distributions .",
    "the birth time distribution for the precursors of the giants  mainly f and g dwarfs  is spread over the age of the disc and similar to that of the f , g , and k dwarfs still on the main sequence . as a consequence ,",
