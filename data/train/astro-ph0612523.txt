    "a small subset of radio - loud active galactic nuclei ( agns ) show rapid variability at complete em spectrum with the emission being strongly polarized .",
    "such agns are called blazars and their radiation at all wavelength is predominantly non - thermal .",
    "bl lac objects are a subclass of blazars which have featureless spectrum , so it is difficult to estimate the distances , luminosities and redshifts of these objects . in a small population of bl lacs ,",
    "host galaxies are also seen",
    ". a careful study of these sources can give few weak emission lines which will be helpful to determine the redshifts . in the present work based on",
    "the sample of 169 confirmed and 109 possible bl lacs , our main aim to find genuine bl lacs and separate out bl lacs and non bl lacs in two different lists .",
    "we searched the spectra of 1022 bl lacs sample in sdss dr5 catalog and found spectra were available for 278 sources .",
    "the spectra of these sources were extracted and corrected for the galactic extinction using the extinction curve of ( schlegel et al .",
    "extinction corrected spectras were smoothed with a boxcar of 5 pixels for illustration .",
    "then we visually inspected spectra of all sources and based on that we divided the spectra into two groups : ( i ) featureless spectrum ( bl lac objects ) , ( ii ) spectrum with emission and/or absorption line features ( non bl lacs ) . + in our visual inspection , we found 137 sources from the list of confirmed and 90 sources from possible bl lacs have featureless spectrum i.e. confirmed bl lacs .",
    "we found respectively 32 and 19 sources from confirmed and possible candidate lists are non featureless and so classified as possibly non bl lacs .",
    "further analysis is going on .",
    "in the sdss spectra of our sample of 278 bl lac objects , we found 227 sources are genuine bl lacs and 51 possibly belongs to non bl lacs .",
    "we have following strategy for further detail analysis of spectra to study these sources in more detail . +",
    "*  sources having non featureless spectrum , redshift will be determined .",
    "+ * 2 . * using multi - wavelength published data of these sources , we will be able to get the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) . + * 3 .",
    "* we also have plan to search for new bl lacs in sdss dr5 data release",
    ". we will do proper modeling of stellar component ( lu et al .",
    "2006 ) and decompose agns spectra into stellar and non stellar nuclear components , provided that two components are comparable in strength .",
