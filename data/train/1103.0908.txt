    "transversity the distribution of transversely polarized quarks inside a transversely polarized hadron was first discussed by ralston and soper @xcite , who suggested its measurement in the double polarized drell - yan process .",
    "although this suggestion was made more than 30 years ago , this demanding double transverse spin asymmetry measurement has not yet been performed . at present",
    "it is in the future physics program of bnl s relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) @xcite and is also considered at gsi - fair , j - parc and nica .",
    "currently rhic is the only accelerator where polarized proton - proton collisions can be performed .",
    "therefore , in this article we will focus on rhic .",
    "ralston and soper considered the double transverse spin asymmetry ( @xmath1 ) integrated over the transverse momentum @xmath2 of the lepton pair ( later also reconsidered in @xcite ) , and at measured @xmath2 , in particular at @xmath3 .",
    "both cases will receive nonzero contributions from transversity .",
    "the asymmetry as a function of @xmath2 has been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite in a collinear collins - soper - sterman resummation approach , showing it to be maximally of order 5% and fairly flat in @xmath2 up to a few gev . at measured @xmath2",
    "there will however be background contributions from transverse momentum dependence of partons , that have not yet been considered .",
    "we will study these contributions to the double transverse spin asymmetries at measured transverse momentum in both the drell - yan process and in @xmath0-boson production , where in the latter case one expects zero contribution from transversity within the standard model @xcite .    at rhic single transverse spin asymmetries ( @xmath4 )",
    "will be studied in @xmath0 production as well , with the goal of measuring the sign of the sivers effect @xcite .",
    "this effect refers to the fact that the transverse momentum distribution of quarks inside a transversely polarized hadron can be asymmetric w.r.t .  the spin direction @xcite .",
    "this spin - orbit coupling effect arises from initial and/or final state interactions and has a calculable process dependence ( when factorization applies ) .",
    "the sign in drell - yan or @xmath0 production is predicted to be opposite to the one in semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( sidis ) , the process in which the sivers effect asymmetry was first observed @xcite . the sivers effect may also generate background for the transversity double transverse spin asymmetries in the drell - yan process at measured @xmath2 , through a sivers effect in both incoming hadrons .",
    "this double sivers effect will be investigated in this paper .",
    "moreover , it can lead to a nonzero result in @xmath0 production , which could be mistaken for physics beyond the standard model , for instance from the complex mixing of @xmath0 bosons with a hypothetical @xmath5 boson that appears in many extensions of the standard model @xcite .",
    "we will study these aspects of the double sivers effect contribution quantitatively in this paper .    besides the double sivers effect we will include contributions from another transverse momentum dependent effect that was first discussed by ralston and soper @xcite : it describes the distribution of longitudinally polarized quarks inside a transversely polarized hadron .",
    "both effects are described by a transverse momentum dependent parton distribution ( tmd ) : the sivers effect by a tmd often denoted by @xmath6 @xcite and the other by @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the latter function also appears in the analysis of the evolution equation of the twist - three function @xmath8 @xcite and is in the literature sometimes referred to as one of the two `` worm gear '' functions @xcite .",
    "we will adopt this convention and refer to @xmath7 as the worm gear ( wg ) function , because the other worm gear function @xmath9 will not be discussed here .",
    "the expressions for the double sivers and wg effects for drell - yan have been given in ref .",
    "quantitatively , both effects have been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite in polarized proton - antiproton drell - yan at gsi - fair , and the double wg effect in @xmath0 and @xmath10 boson production at rhic in ref .",
    "the latter study contains some mistake in its eq .",
    "( 21 ) that will be corrected here , without altering the conclusions .    as can be seen from the expressions in ref .",
    "@xcite , one can consider a specific frame , the so - called collins - soper frame , that in principle allows one to distinguish the double transverse spin asymmetries @xmath11 arising from transversity , the sivers effect and the wg effect .",
    "different angular dependences can be projected out allowing to single out a specific contribution .",
    "transversity leads to a spin asymmetry proportional to @xmath12 , where the azimuthal angle @xmath13 is measured between the spin plane and the lepton plane , whereas the other two effects lead to spin asymmetries independent of this lepton azimuthal angle .",
    "however , in the laboratory frame , as we will show in this paper , all three effects will contribute to the angular distribution @xmath12 .",
    "this is in contrast to what a collinear factorization approach would suggest , e.g. , in the treatment as applied in ref .",
    "@xcite , the sivers and wg contributions are absent from the start . in that approach the expression for @xmath11 in the lab frame will be only in terms of the transversity distribution ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which might lead to wrong conclusions about transversity .",
    "the lab frame is thus _ a priori _ not the right frame to extract the transversity distribution from the asymmetry @xmath11 , however , it is experimentally more ` direct ' to extract spin asymmetries in the lab frame .",
    "analyzing the data in the lab frame might also be more accurate , because any additional uncertainties from the transformation to the cs frame will avoided .",
    "furthermore , an analysis in the cs frame and the lab frame could be cross - checked with each other if one knows the expected differences between the two frames . in @xmath0-boson production with a leptonic decay ,",
    "on the other hand , it is impossible to transform to the cs frame , because the neutrino will go unobserved rendering it impossible to determine the transverse momentum of the @xmath0 boson .",
    "this means that the double transverse spin asymmetries in @xmath0-boson production _ have _ to be studied in the lab frame , where the transverse momentum dependent effects form a background for the new physics studies as proposed in @xcite .",
    "we think it is therefore important to know quantitatively the size of the spin asymmetries in the lab frame caused by partonic transverse momentum effects in the drell - yan process and @xmath0-boson production , which will be explored in the remainder of this paper .",
    "in both processes we have to deal with vector - boson production from hadron - hadron collisions , with a subsequent leptonic decay . the cross section for such a process has its leading contribution coming from the diagram in fig .  [",
    "fig : dygeneral ] .",
    "this contribution can be split into a lepton and hadron tensor connected by the appropriate vector - boson propagator .",
    "the hadronic tensor can be expressed by @xmath14 + \\left(1\\leftrightarrow 2\\right)\\ ] ] in terms of the fully unintegrated quark correlator @xmath15 and the quark  vector - boson vertices @xmath16 and @xmath17 , where the primed vertex has the complex conjugated coupling strength .",
    "the gauge link @xmath18 that renders the correlator gauge invariant is not specified at this stage .",
    "writing the momenta in terms of lightcone and transverse components as @xmath19 $ ] , the delta function in the hadron tensor can be approximated by @xmath20 which is accurate up to @xmath21 corrections , where @xmath22 is the photon momentum squared .",
    "keeping higher order corrections in the kinematics only gives very small corrections , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "this fixes @xmath23 and @xmath24 and allows us to write the hadron tensor as @xmath25   + \\left(1\\leftrightarrow 2\\right),\\ ] ] in terms of the @xmath26-integrated quark correlator @xmath27 and a similar @xmath28 , which is integrated over @xmath29 .",
    "the gauge link is process dependent , leading to a sivers function in drell - yan that has the opposite sign compared to the one in sidis , cf .",
    "for instance ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein . in the double sivers effect",
    "this sign is not relevant however .",
    "the quark correlators can be parameterized in terms of transverse momentum dependent distribution functions by @xmath30 in which we only wrote the relevant distribution functions for the transverse spin asymmetries to leading order in @xmath31 and @xmath32 . for further details",
    "we refer to , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we will define a spin flip symmetric and antisymmetric cross section by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the hadron tensor symmetrized or antisymmetrized with respect to the proton spins , @xmath35 is the vector - boson propagator , @xmath36 is the lepton tensor @xmath37\\ ] ] in terms of the lepton - vector - boson vertex @xmath38 and , finally , @xmath39 is the phase space element @xmath40",
    "the distribution function @xmath41 describes the probability of finding a quark @xmath42 with lightcone momentum fraction @xmath43 and transverse momentum with length @xmath44 . as often done , for our phenomenological studies we will assume factorization between @xmath45 and @xmath43 dependence and assume a gaussian dependence on @xmath45 , i.e. @xmath46 such a gaussian dependence has been shown to work very well @xcite .",
    "we will use the value of the width , @xmath47 found by @xcite based on the cahn effect in unpolarized sidis .",
    "although this value may differ from the @xmath48 in drell - yan , the deviation is not expected to matter for our purposes and to fall within the error in the estimates we will consider .",
    "the sivers distribution function describes the correlation between the partonic transverse momentum and proton spin direction .",
    "the probability of finding a quark @xmath42 with transverse momentum @xmath49 inside a transversely polarized proton is given by @xmath50 in sidis there are clear experimental observations of the asymmetries that would arise from the sivers effect , offering strong support for the latter effect . within that picture",
    "the current experimental data allows for a determination of the sivers function for both the @xmath51 and @xmath52 quarks _ and _ anti - quarks . in the recent extraction obtained by @xcite , the sivers function for sidis",
    "is parameterized as @xmath53 with @xmath54 the numerical values found in the extraction are @xmath55 for the flavor independent width of the distribution and the numbers in table [ siversparams ] for the parameters in the flavor dependent function that describes the @xmath43 dependence .",
    "the current knowledge of the sivers function at small @xmath43 is limited , but the single spin asymmetry measurements at rhic will certainly improve this .",
    "for the moment , we take what is known until a better determination will be available .",
    "taking into account the error bars in @xcite we come to the rough estimate that the overall effect , as will be calculated in section [ dy ] and [ wproduction ] , can be maximally enhanced by an order of magnitude .",
    "as said before , the sign of the sivers function for drell - yan is supposed to be opposite to the one for sidis , however in the _",

    "data on double transverse spin asymmetries @xmath57 that receive contributions from the wg effect has become available only very recently @xcite .",
    "the recent measurements on @xmath58he indicate that @xmath7 for the up - quark is not small @xcite .    here",
    "we will employ a model for this wg function .",
    "both the bag model @xcite and the spectator model @xcite agree quite well with a gaussian approximation of the transverse momentum dependence for not too large values of the transverse momentum .",
    "we will therefore use the gaussian ansatz , which allows us to express the transverse momentum dependent distribution as @xmath59 in terms of its first transverse moment @xmath60 , which is defined as @xmath61 for the width we will take a value in accordance with the bag model @xmath62 for the first moment , we will use a wandzura - wilczek ( ww ) type approximation @xcite to express it in terms of the known helicity distribution @xmath63 by @xmath64 for numerical estimations of this function the dssv helicity distribution @xcite will be used .",

    "this is in excellent agreement with the evaluation on the lattice ( at the scale 1.6 gev ) : @xmath69 and @xmath70 from ref .",
    "all this gives us confidence that the estimates below are sufficiently realistic .",
    "in the drell - yan process the virtual photon produces a lepton and anti - lepton , both of which can be detected .",
    "this allows a full determination of all the kinematic variables , such that one can transform to the so - called collins - soper frame @xcite . in that frame",
    "a correlation between the lepton transverse momentum and the proton transverse spin direction will come solely from the transversity distribution , which makes this process very suitable for an extraction of this distribution function from @xmath11 .",

    "the sivers and wg function both cause the photon transverse momentum and the proton spins to be correlated . when the virtual photon decays , the decay products are more inclined to move in the direction of the parent particle which , in turn , causes the direction of the decay products to be _ also _ correlated with the proton spin directions , albeit diluted .    in order to estimate the error that one would possibly make in the extraction of the transversity distributions from @xmath11 by not going to the collins - soper frame",

    "the first extraction of the quark transversity distribution @xmath112 @xcite , however , indicates it to be about half its maximally allowed value at @xmath113 gev@xmath114 .",
    "therefore , if this also applies to the antiquark @xmath115 , an asymmetry of 1% or less should be expected at rhic .",
    "asymmetries that are below the permille level in the entire kinematic range of interest will generally not be shown",
    ". they will be below the detection limit at rhic , which will be mainly restricted by systematic errors .",
    "for the case of drell - yan this will only leave the sivers effect contribution to the asymmetry @xmath108 , displayed in fig .",
    "[ attdy ] as function of @xmath2 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 . in the plot",
    "we also included , albeit completely negligible , the sivers effect contribution to @xmath107 , just in case the sivers function at these values of @xmath43 and @xmath116 turns out to be much larger .",
    "the @xmath108 asymmetry reaches up to the percent level , but only for large @xmath71 outside the range of interest . in the standard drell - yan range between the @xmath118 and @xmath119 ,",
    "the asymmetry is on the permille level for the double sivers effect and far below that level for the double wg effect .",
    "the @xmath107 asymmetry receives a contribution from the double sivers effect at a level of @xmath120 and from the @xmath7 function a contribution at a level of @xmath121 . at small @xmath116",
    "the asymmetry is small due to the smallness of the sivers function with respect to the unpolarized distribution at low values of @xmath43 , whereas at higher values of @xmath116 the @xmath122 suppression becomes important .",
    "one way or the other , these magnitudes are far below the detection limit at rhic , even if one takes into account a possible enhancement of the effect by an order of magnitude due to the uncertainty in the used parametrization of the sivers function .",
    "therefore , the tmd effects will not spoil a determination of the transversity distribution if those are determined from @xmath107 in the lab frame instead of in the collins - soper frame . as a cross - check , to assure that tmd effects are small , one could verify that the @xmath108 asymmetry is small .",
    "the @xmath107 asymmetry is bounded by the larger @xmath108 asymmetry due to the @xmath122 suppression , irrespective of any assumptions on the sivers function or the worm - gear distribution .",
    "we want to note that , considering asymmetries of this size , higher twist effects could become important . in case of incomplete averaging over the azimuthal angle ,",
    "the @xmath77 independent asymmetry @xmath108 may form a background for a determination of the @xmath77 dependent @xmath107 , but given its magnitude this should also not pose a problem .",
    "the @xmath2-integrated asymmetries have also been calculated and were found to be a factor two smaller for @xmath123 and a factor 1000 smaller for @xmath124 .",
    "this agrees with the expectation that such effects are ( at least ) @xmath125 power suppressed in this case . for completeness , we mention that the maximal @xmath2-integrated @xmath123 asymmetry from transversity is estimated to be at the few percent level at rhic at a center of mass energy of 200 and 500 gev @xcite .",
    "in @xmath0-boson production one expects zero contribution from transversity within the standard model @xcite .",
    "this strong prediction offers the possibility to study contributions from a hypothetical @xmath5 boson that appears in many extensions of the standard model .",
    "it is at least ten times heavier than the @xmath0 boson and is expected to produce double transverse spin asymmetries at rhic only through its mixing with the @xmath0 boson , which gives the latter a small righthanded coupling to fermions . in ref .",
    "@xcite this was studied quantitatively and it was shown that rhic may be able to produce competitive bounds if the original design goals are met and if @xmath126 is not very much smaller than @xmath127 .",
    "it was also shown that all other standard model background was well below the permille level , but for the background from the double sivers and wg effect this was not yet quantitatively estimated . in the leptonic decay of a @xmath0 boson the neutrino will go unobserved , which renders it impossible to determine the collins - soper frame and remove the background .",
    "therefore , we will estimate quantitatively the sizes of these standard model effects to see whether it would jeopardize any measurement of this @xmath128 mixing using spin asymmetries .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the tmd background was dismissed on the basis of a dimensional counting argument .",
    "if the single sivers effect is a 10% effect , a double sivers effect asymmetry in @xmath0 production would be on the percent level .",
    "however , as the sivers asymmetry is an azimuthal asymmetry , the lack of the knowledge of the @xmath0 momentum prevents reconstruction of the asymmetry in @xmath0 production directly . instead",
    ", a lepton asymmetry can be measured ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , which has a reduced magnitude . naively one would expect from a dimensional analysis a large suppression of the size @xmath129 , where @xmath2 denotes the gauge boson transverse momentum and @xmath130 the lepton transverse momentum .",
    "the reason being that the asymmetry should vanish in the limit @xmath131 and the only compensating scale is @xmath130 .",
    "this yields an asymmetry well below the permille level .",
    "a similar argument would suggest the single spin asymmetry @xmath132 in @xmath0 production arising from the sivers effect to be @xmath133 suppressed , leading to an asymmetry below the percent level .",
    "however , the sivers effect in @xmath132 in @xmath0 production has recently been studied theoretically @xcite and a large asymmetry ( of order 10% ) was predicted . moreover , in ref .",
    "@xcite the lepton asymmetry @xmath134 was evaluated numerically , which has a reduced magnitude , but still is around 3% for @xmath135 production .",
    "this is larger than expected from the dimensional argument and is likely because near resonance the width of the @xmath0 boson becomes an important scale",
    ". the suppression can therefore be only as small as @xmath136 .",
    "similarly , a double sivers effect contribution to @xmath11 in @xmath0 production is expected to be on the percent level and a factor @xmath137 smaller for the lepton asymmetry @xmath138 near resonance . when integrated over @xmath130 instead , one can expect the asymmetry to be suppressed by a factor of @xmath139 , which implies an asymmetry well below the permille level .",
    "below we confirm these insights in an explicit calculation .",
    "starting from eq .  , the spin symmetric and antisymmetric cross section for the production of a charged lepton from a @xmath140 boson decay can be expressed as @xmath141 where we used @xmath142 to write @xmath143 . for @xmath140 production the quark and lepton vertices",

    "[ attwp ] , because they are largest .",
    "the maximal asymmetry is near resonance and reaches up to @xmath164 , which is already below the detection limit at rhic .",
    "however , for a bound on a possible @xmath128 mixing it is not the differential asymmetry that is relevant , but the asymmetry in the integrated cross section . in those asymmetries",
    "the contribution at @xmath165 largely cancels the contribution at @xmath166 , resulting in very small asymmetries .",
    "we find the integrated asymmetry in @xmath140 production around @xmath167 and in @xmath135 production around @xmath120 , far below detection limits at rhic .",
    "this confirms the expectation expressed in ref .",
    "@xcite that the background from tmds , is indeed negligible .",
    "we calculated the transverse momentum dependent double transverse spin asymmetries in the laboratory frame for drell - yan and @xmath0 production arising from the sivers effect and from the worm gear distribution function @xmath7 within transverse momentum dependent factorization .",
    "those asymmetries were previously calculated only in the collins - soper frame where they are independent of the lepton azimuthal angle .",
    "the advantage being that one can , in that frame , easily distinguish them from the asymmetry coming from transversity . in the lab frame a residual dependence on the lepton azimuthal angle of the tmd asymmetries survives and enters the double transverse spin asymmetry in exactly the same way as transversity does .",
    "this is in contrast to a collinear factorization approach where the effects from tmds are absent to begin with .",
    "therefore , a nonzero @xmath168 asymmetry @xmath11 in drell - yan _ in the lab frame _ is _ a priori _ not a sufficient indication of a nonzero transversity distribution .",
    "however , from what is known about the magnitudes of the sivers and worm gear functions , our conclusion is that the tmd background is below the permille level .",
    "therefore , a percent level asymmetry _ can _ be viewed as coming from transversity .",
    "that is an important conclusion for the rhic spin program .",
    "transversity distributions can thus safely be determined from the transverse momentum dependent double spin asymmetry in the lab frame , like for the @xmath2-integrated asymmetry , assuming of course the antiquark transversity distributions are sufficiently large . as a cross - check of the smallness of the tmd background",
    ", one can verify that the angular independent @xmath108 asymmetry that arises only from the mentioned tmd effects , is indeed much smaller .",
    "in the leptonic decay of a @xmath0 boson the neutrino will go unobserved , which renders it impossible to determine the collins - soper frame . in that frame",
    "a correlation between the lepton azimuthal angle and the proton transverse spin direction can solely be caused by a non - zero righthanded coupling of the @xmath0 boson in combination with a non - zero transversity distribution , which makes it a very suitable process for the determination of a possible @xmath128 mixing as discussed in @xcite . in the lab frame , however , there might again be a residual asymmetry coming from the double sivers or wg effects .",
    "they can lead to a nonzero result in @xmath0 production , which could be mistaken for physics beyond the standard model or simply spoil the opportunity to bound a possible @xmath128 mixing .",
    "we obtained numerical estimates for the sizes of the asymmetries at rhic and found that they are far below the detection limits .",
    "this means that the background from the double sivers and worm gear effects is negligible and does not hamper the investigation of the complex mixing of @xmath0-@xmath5 bosons as discussed in @xcite .",
