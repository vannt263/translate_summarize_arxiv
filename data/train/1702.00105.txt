    "for a broad uniform distribution of pulse duration times , this leads to the erroneous but widely cited conclusion that this process is capable of producing @xmath153-type spectra.@xcite on the other hand , it has been established that truncated power law pulse shapes may lead to pink noise , with such processes commonly referred to as fractal shot noise.@xcite",
    "the characteristic function for a sum of independent random variables is the product of their individual characteristic functions . for a super - position of exactly @xmath0 uncorrelated pulses in a time interval of duration @xmath1 , the conditional probability density function for the process defined by eq .",
    "is thus given by @xmath154 where the angular brackets as usual denote an average over all random variables of @xmath155 , @xmath156 assuming that the number of pulses @xmath68 is poisson distributed , @xmath157 the probability density function for the random variable @xmath158 is given by @xmath159 where the characteristic function is defined by @xmath160 taking the limit of integration for @xmath5 to infinity and making a change of integration variable defined by @xmath25 results in @xmath161 = \\gamma \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty } { \\text{d}}\\theta \\left [ c_a(u\\phi(\\theta ) ) - 1 \\right]\\ ] ] where @xmath162 is the characteristic function for the amplitude distribution @xmath10 .",
    "thus , the probability density function is determined by amplitude distribution and the pulse shape and is not affected by the distribution of pulse durations .",
    "this is in agreement with the two lowest order moments derived in sec .",
    "[ sec : moments ] .    for some particular cases of pulse shapes and amplitude distributions , the probability density function can be calculated in closed form .",
    "consider first the case of an exponential distribution of pulse amplitudes , @xmath163 where @xmath11 is the mean pulse amplitude and @xmath67 is defined only for positive amplitudes @xmath164 . in this case",
    "the raw amplitude moments are given by @xmath165 and the mean value for the process is @xmath111 and the variance is @xmath166 . for both one- and two - sided exponential pulses ,",
    "the characteristic function is @xmath167 and the probability density function for the random variable is a gamma distribution@xcite @xmath168 thus , the skewness and flatness moments are @xmath169 and @xmath170 , revealing the strong intermittency of the process in the case of weak pulse overlap . for large @xmath45",
    "the skewness and excess flatness moments both vanish , consistent with a normal distribution of the fluctuations which arise in this limit.@xcite    allowing both positive and negative pulse amplitudes , the laplace amplitude distribution with vanishing mean is of particular interest , @xmath171 where @xmath172 is the standard deviation , @xmath173 . for this symmetric distribution ,",
    "both the mean value and the skewness moment for the random variable vanish , @xmath174 and @xmath175 . for both one- and two - sided exponential pulses the variance of the random variable",
    "is @xmath176 and the probability density function is given by@xcite @xmath177 where @xmath144 denotes the modified bessel function of the second kind .",
    "it follows that the flatness moment is @xmath170 , which is the same as for exponentially distributed amplitudes discussed above .",
    "in general , the fourier transform of the @xmath178th derivative of a pulse function @xmath13 is given by @xmath179 , where @xmath180 is the fourier amplitude as defined by eq .  .",
    "consider a pulse function that is smooth for all @xmath181 except at @xmath120 , where the @xmath178th derivative is dominated by a delta distribution due to a discontinuity in the @xmath182th derivative , @xmath183 .",
    "the fourier transform of the @xmath178th derivative therefore gives a flat spectrum , @xmath184 .",
    "thus , the power spectral density for the pulse function is anticipated to have a power law asymptote given by @xmath185 .",
    "this is a heuristic description of the power law scaling in the frequency spectra for exponential pulses described in sec .",

    ", the pulse shape approaches a smooth gaussian function .",
    "more generally , the pulse function has a discontinuity in the @xmath187 derivative and the fourier transform of the @xmath137 derivative will be dominated by a delta distribution .",
    "indeed , the case @xmath138 gives the familiar result @xmath188 and the power spectral density scales as @xmath189 .",
    "similarly , for @xmath140 the pulse function has a break point at @xmath120 and the second derivative of the pulse function is dominated by a delta distribution , @xmath190 resulting in a power spectral density that which scales as @xmath191 for high frequencies , similar to the case of the unit triangle pulse discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : triangle ] .    the power spectral density for a super - position of gamma pulses with constant duration can be calculated explicitly and is given by @xmath192 this frequency spectrum has the asymptotic limit @xmath193 as expected from the discontinuity in the @xmath187th derivative of the pulse function and the general relation given by eq .  .",
    "this example clearly demonstrates the intimate connection between a discontinuity in the pulse function or its derivatives and algebraic tail in the power spectral density for high frequencies .",
    "in many relevant cases there will be additional noise to the stochastic process defined by eq .  .",
    "consider here the case where statistically independent and random noise is added to the process comprised by a super - position of uncorrelated pulses,@xcite @xmath194 where @xmath195 is a normally distributed process with vanishing mean and unit standard deviation .",
    "it is straight forward to shown that the mean value and variance for the process @xmath98 are @xmath196 and @xmath197 , respectively .",
    "the signal to noise ratio is the inverse of the ratio of the variance for the two independent processes , @xmath198 introducing the rescaled signals as defined by eq .",

    "<S> the steep algebraic tail at high frequencies in these cases is demonstrated to follow from the discontinuity in the derivative of the pulse function . </S>",
    "<S> a random distribution of pulse durations is shown to result in apparently longer correlation times but has no influence on the asymptotic power law tail of the frequency spectrum . </S>",
