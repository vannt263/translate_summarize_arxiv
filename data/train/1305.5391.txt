    "the ricci flow , introduced by hamilton , is a geometric flow for metrics on @xmath0-manifolds , and has played a decisive role in the proof of the poincar conjecture and thurston s geometrization conjecture for @xmath1-manifolds .",
    "it is natural to then investigate a corresponding problem for contact @xmath1-manifolds .",
    "one of way of doing this is to find a cr analogue of the ricci flow on a pseudohermitian @xmath1-manifold ( see section  sec : definitions for definitions and basic notions in pseudohermitian geometry ) .",
    "recall that a strictly pseudoconvex cr structure on a @xmath1-manifold @xmath2 is given by a cooriented plane field @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a contact form , together with a compatible complex structure @xmath5 .",

    "the torsion flow is then the following pde , @xmath9it seems to us that the torsion flow is the right cr analogue of the ricci flow .",

    ", one can still hope that the torsion flow improves properties of the contact manifold underlying the cr - manifold .",
    "the mostly used tools in the study of hamilton s ricci flow @xcite consist of maximum principles .",
    "exceptions are formed by hamilton s entropy formula which holds for closed surfaces with positive gaussian curvature @xcite , and also by perelman s entropy formulas @xcite .",
    "these formulas can be thought of as monotonicity formulas for integrals of local geometric quantities .    in this paper",
    ", we try to do the same for the torsion flow by setting up some monotonicity formulas for perelman - type functionals .",
    "we conclude this introduction with a brief plan of the paper .    * in section  [ sec : motivation ] and section  [ sec : statement_monotonicity_results ] we motivate the definition of the torsion flow and give more precise statements of our results . * in section  [ sec : definitions ] we survey basic notions in cr geometry .",
    "* in sections  [ section : tanaka_connection_global_frame ] and [ section : homogeneous_contact_manifolds ] we describe cr manifolds with a global coframe and we also define homogeneous cr manifolds . on the latter class",
    "the torsion flow reduces to an ode if we start with some appropriate initial conditions .",
    "these computations illustrate the behavior of the torsion flow in special cases , and in these cases the torsion flow behaves as can be expected from a ricci - like flow . * finally , in section  [ sec : entropy ] we discuss analogues of perelman s entropy formulas .",
