    "recently  @xcite an approach was established to study the ground state properties of algebraic hamiltonians .",
    "this approach follows closely the algorithm established in  @xcite . in particular , the approach was applied to describe the ground state of even  even nuclei within the interacting boson model  @xcite . in quantum optics ,",
    "the procedure was used to determine the phase diagrams of the transitions between the normal regime to the super - radiant behavior of the ground states of two- and three - level systems interacting with a one - mode radiation field  @xcite .",
    "this approach evaluates the mean value of the hamiltonian with respect to variational test coherent states associated to the corresponding algebraic structures of the hamiltonian .",
    "there exists a tomographic approach , which also uses mean values of density operators in an ensemble of bases to get information on the state of the system  @xcite . for continuous variables ,",
    "the tomographic approach has been introduced in  @xcite in the form of optical tomography .",
    "the symplectic tomography is established in  @xcite , and a recent review of these tomograms is given in  @xcite .",

    "the squeezed tomography is discussed in  @xcite , which is a fair probability distribution of a discrete random variable .",
    "one of the aims of this work is to extend the approach mentioned above to have information of the complete energy spectrum by considering the mean values of the hamiltonian with respect to extremal density matrices  @xcite .",
    "this is achieved by writing the mean value of the hamiltonian as a function of the variables of a general finite - dimensional density matrix  @xcite together with the parameters of the hamiltonian . to guarantee the positivity of the density matrix",

    "another goal of this work is to obtain new inequalities connecting entropy and mean value of energy for this qudit system .",
    "we show that there exists a bound for the sum of energy and entropy determined by the partition function taken for a particular value of its argument .",
    "the method to obtain these inequalities is based on known property of positivity of the relative entropy involving two density matrices of the system states  @xcite .",
    "analogous mathematical inequalities have been discussed in  @xcite .",
