    "the classical shannon - mcmillan theorem states that , for an ergodic shift system over a finite alphabet ( spin chain , data stream , discrete stochastic process ... ) the distribution on a box of large volume @xmath1 is essentially carried by a typical set of approximate size @xmath2 with @xmath3 being the kolmogorov - sinai dynamical entropy of the system , which in our case is identical to the mean ( base @xmath4 ) shannon entropy .",
    "each element of this typical set has a probability of order @xmath5 .",
    "the latter fact is usually called _ asymptotic equipartition property _ ( aep ) . in order to simplify the arguments throughout this introduction we confine ourselves to the one - dimensional case .",
    "thus instead of large boxes we consider @xmath6-blocks with @xmath6 large . in classical information theory the one - dimensional lattice systems model information sources .",
    "the aep is of major importance for source coding ( c.f .",
    "it implies the possibility of lossless transmission for an @xmath6-block message , using typically only @xmath7 bits . the fact that on the typical set the probabilities of all elements are of the same magnitude implies that better compression is ( again typically ) impossible .",
    "considering an ergodic quantum spin lattice system ( again , for simplicity , one - dimensional ) , we prove that the @xmath6-block state is essentially carried by a typical subspace ( of the entire hilbert space ) of dimension close to @xmath8 .",
    "each one - dimensional projector into that subspace has an expected value of order @xmath9 . here",
    "@xmath10 is the mean von neumann entropy of the system .",
    "the reduction of this statement to the commutative setting is exactly the classical theorem .",
    "+ several attempts have been made to establish a quantum version of the shannon - mcmillan theorem for stationary quantum systems .",
    "due to the fact that in quantum theory there exist several entropy notions ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , depending on e.g. how the measuring process is incorporated , there is a number of different approaches .",
    "the paper @xcite of king and leniewski concerns the classical stochastic process obtained from an ergodic quantum source by measurements of the individual components and derives an asymptotic dimension of a relevant subspace in terms of the classical mean entropy .",
    "this relevant subspace however is in general not minimal , and consequently not optimal for compression purposes . in particular ,",
    "the aep is not fulfilled for this subspace . for the bernoulli case ( of independent components )",
    "the king / leniewski result is optimal and consistent with the earlier result by jozsa and schumacher @xcite .    in the paper @xcite hiai and petz , using a considerably stronger condition of complete ergodicity derived upper and lower bounds ( in terms of the von neumann mean entropy ) for the asymptotic dimension of a minimal relevant subspace . in view of our results",
    "it turns out that the upper bound is sharp .",
    "however the results in @xcite concern the more general situation of estimating minimal projectors with respect to a reference state in terms of relative entropy .",
    "for the special cases of ergodic gibbs quantum lattice systems , @xcite , respectively for ergodic algebraic states , @xcite , hiai and petz could prove the shannon - mcmillan theorem .",
    "for the gibbs situation they even established the convergence in the strong operator topology in the corresponding gns representation .    for further special classes of quantum systems , namely for a lattice version of free bosons or fermions , johnson and suhov present a proof of a quantum shannon - mcmillan theorem , @xcite .",
    "the authors use occupation numbers and their relation to the eigenvalues of gibbs ensemble density matrices to obtain a sequence of independent ( not identically distributed ) random variables .",
    "it turns out that this classical process has a mean entropy which is precisely the mean von neumann entropy of the corresponding quantum system .",
    "also in the context of quantum statistical mechanics datta and suhov @xcite prove a shannon - mcmillan theorem for some weakly non - stationary sequence of local quantum gibbs states in the neighborhood of a classical system .",
    "the authors use the quantum aep to derive a reliable compression / decompression scheme which compresses the quantum state according to the von neumann entropy rate .",
    "neshveyev and strmer considered the cnt - entropy in the context of asymptotically abelian @xmath11-dynamical systems with locality in order to derive bounds for the asymptotic dimension of a typical subspace , @xcite .",
    "they obtained a shannon - mcmillan result for the special case of tracial states which covers the classical result . for our quantum lattice systems",
    "however this essentially reduces to the situation of bernoulli states , where the individual components are even supposed to be in the trace state .",
    "let us discuss , in an informal way , the main ideas behind the proof of the quantum shannon - mcmillan theorem presented here .    at the beginning ,",
    "we follow mainly the approach of hiai and petz @xcite .",
    "it is well known that one can find a classical subsystem ( maximal abelian subalgebra of the entire non - commutative algebra of observables ) of the @xmath6-block quantum system with shannon entropy equal to the von neumann entropy @xmath12 of the full @xmath6-block quantum state .",
    "starting from this abelian @xmath6-block algebra we construct an abelian quasilocal algebra .",
    "it is a subalgebra of the entire quasilocal algebra of the infinite quantum lattice system . restricting the given quantum state to this classical infinite lattice system",
    "we obtain a stochastic process .",
    "the @xmath13-th component of this process is related to the @xmath13-th @xmath6-block of the original system .",
    "this classical process is ergodic if one assumes for instance _ complete ergodicity _ of the original system as hiai and petz do in their paper . we know from classical shannon - mcmillan that the probability distribution of a large @xmath13-block of this classical system ( corresponding to a @xmath14-block of the quantum system ) has an essential support of size @xmath15 ( and entropy close to @xmath16 ) . here",
    "@xmath17 denotes the mean entropy of the classical system , which is in general smaller than @xmath12 , due to possible correlations . for the quantum context",
    "this translates into the existence of an essentially carrying subspace of dimension @xmath15 for the @xmath14-block . with @xmath10 being the mean von neumann entropy , we arrive ( for large @xmath6 ) at an estimate @xmath18 , and",
    "infer the existence of an ( at most ) @xmath19 -dimensional essentially carrying subspace ( typical subspace ) of a @xmath14-block of the quantum system .",
    "if we would take into account that the quantum system might have a still smaller ( better from the point of view of resources needed ) typical subspace ( compared to what is delivered by the constructed classically restricted system ) we would have arrived at the result that @xmath20 is an _",
    "asymptotic upper bound _ for the dimension of a typical subspace of the quantum system .",
    "so far , we followed the ideas of hiai and petz @xcite , where under the assumption of complete ergodicity estimates for the typical dimension were derived .",
    "in fact , we can extend this result obtaining not only upper and lower bounds but a limit assertion for the dimension of a typical subspace . instead of complete ergodicity",
    "we require only ergodicity , thus establishing a quantum shannon - mcmillan theorem .    beyond technicalities ,",
    "this can be accomplished by",
    "\\a ) observing that we _ do not _ have to take into account the possibility that the quantum system behaves better than the classical one ( see some lines above ) : the very fact that the asymptotic von neumann entropy of a large @xmath6-block is @xmath21 excludes the possibility of an essentially carrying subspace of dimension significantly smaller than @xmath20 .",
    "in fact , the contribution to the entropy due to this subspace would be smaller than @xmath21 .",
    "the non - typical part yields only a contribution of the order @xmath22 .",
    "this is due to a uniform integrability argument ( based upon lemma [ class_resultat ] ) and    \\b ) the condition of complete ergodicity can be avoided , since a quantum analog of the following result concerning classical systems can be shown ( theorem [ ergod_components ] ) : if a dynamical system is ergodic with respect to the transformation @xmath23 , then , though it may be non - ergodic with respect to @xmath24 ( for a given @xmath25 ) , all of its @xmath24-ergodic components have the same entropy , and the number of ergodic components is at most @xmath6 .",
    "note that the absence of complete ergodicity therefore reflects some intrinsic periodicity of the system .",
    "periodicities naturally appear in a large variety of stationary ( quantum ) stochastic processes .",
    "finally let us mention that the techniques used here to derive the quantum shannon - mcmillan theorem can be modified to prove a quantum version of breiman s strengthening ( in the sense of pointwise convergence , @xcite ) of the classical result . with the notion of an individual trajectory being problematic in the quantum case , in the forthcoming paper @xcite we give a reformulation of breiman s theorem , which has an immediate translation into the quantum situation .",
    "before we state our main theorems we shortly present the mathematical description for the physical model of a @xmath26-dimensional quantum spin lattice system , at the same time fixing notations .",
    "the standard mathematical formalism is introduced in detail e.g. in @xcite and @xcite . the @xmath26-dimensional infinitely extended lattice corresponds to the group @xmath0 . to each @xmath27",
    "there is associated an algebra @xmath28 of observables for a spin located at site @xmath29 .",

    "this one - to - one correspondence reflects the fact , that the state of the entire spin lattice system is assumed to be determined by the expectation values of all observables on finite subsystems @xmath45 .",
