    "in a wireless communication environment , many of the primary users ( pus ) do not use their licensed frequency bands at all times .",
    "the surveys show that the maximum frequency utilization of the allocated spectrum can be less than 10% @xcite . to increase the frequency utilization in such environments , secondary users ( sus ) equipped with cognitive radios ( crs )  @xcite can be deployed to use the available spectrum ( _ spectrum holes _ ) without interfering with the pus .",
    "spectrum sensing , as the task of finding the spectrum holes , is thus one of the important functions performed by crs .    as an integral part of spectrum sensing , an analog to digital converter ( adc )",
    "is often used to sample the signal at or above the nyquist rate . in wideband scenarios",
    ", this will require very high - speed adcs , which are challenging to implement .",
    "one of the techniques of wideband spectrum sensing ( wss ) , which could relax the high - speed sampling requirement , is a channel - by - channel scanning approach .",
    "a tunable bandpass filter ( bpf ) scans one channel at a time . a narrowband spectrum sensing technique",
    "is then applied to sense if the scanned channel is vacant or not .",
    "this approach is , in general , slow and inflexible @xcite .",
    "another approach , called `` filter - bank''@xcite , is based on using a parallel set of narrowband filters , each covering one channel . in this approach , however , an enormous number of rf components is required due to the parallel structure of the filter bank .",
    "since the spectrum is sparsely occupied , the information rate of the analog signal is much less than the nyquist rate .",
    "therefore , an analog to information converter ( aic ) can be used with sub - nyquist sampling rates , based on the compressed sensing ( cs ) theory @xcite .",
    "compressed sensing is a signal processing technique that can recover an unknown signal with high probability from a small set of linear projections , called _ measurements _ , if the signal is sparse in some domain @xcite .",
    "linear projections of the signal and its sparse representation are described by two matrices called _ measurement matrix _ and _ sensing matrix _ , respectively .",
    "cs has been recently applied to the wideband spectrum sensing to alleviate the need for high sampling rates @xcite .",
    "the spectrum is then reconstructed by a sparse signal recovery algorithm , see , e.g. , @xcite . to reduce the sampling rate , in @xcite , the block structure of the spectrum is also used in the reconstruction process . in all the above literature @xcite , the spectrum holes are detected from the reconstructed spectrum by applying an energy detection algorithm .",
    "although , in each cr , only finding one vacant sub - channel may be enough , in cooperative cr networks , finding more than one spectrum hole is of interest .",
    "therefore , in this paper , our goal is to detect as many spectrum holes as possible with a given number of measurements .",
    "neither the recovery of the signal , nor the detection of all spectrum holes is of direct interest .",
    "we thus introduce a new cs paradigm in which , one is interested in reliable detection of some of the zero blocks , even when the number of measurements is relatively low .    to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "all wideband spectrum sensing methods in the literature that use cs for spectrum sensing ( e.g. , @xcite ) , are based on dense sensing matrices ( matrices which have few , or no , zero entries ) . the recovery algorithms with such matrices are often based on linear or convex optimization with the complexity between @xmath0 and @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the dimension of the signal . in mobile crs with limited power and computational resources , it is impractical to use cs with such costly computations for the reconstruction of the spectrum .",
    "in addition , the processing time required for signal reconstruction can impose a significant delay in the spectrum sensing . these motivate us to look for an ultra low - complexity scheme for spectrum sensing with the goal of detecting a large proportion of spectrum holes .",
    "a popular category of recovery algorithms for cs are those based on message - passing algorithms .",
    "in particular , the approximate message - passing ( amp ) algorithm of @xcite , which works with dense sensing matrices , has attracted much attention due to its remarkable performance / complexity trade - off . in the context of block sparse signals",
    ", it is demonstrated in @xcite that amp with james - steins shrinkage estimator ( amp - js ) can outperform the existing block sparse recovery algorithms .",
    "another subcategory of iterative message - passing recovery algorithms are verification - based ones @xcite , which are based on sparse sensing matrices and are thus of lower complexity compared to the message - passing algorithms on dense matrices ( graphs ) .",
    "these algorithms however are very sensitive to noise .",
    "in addition , their application to the recovery of block sparse signals face a number of fundamental challenges .    in this paper",
    ", we apply an ultra low - complexity scheme to the wideband spectrum sensing , which is based on a block sparse sensing matrix . to this end",
    ", we design a measurement matrix as part of the aic , such that the resulting sensing matrix has a block sparse structure . as will be seen later",
    ", the structure of the sensing matrix affects the performance of zero detection scheme .",
    "we analyze the proposed zero - block detection scheme for regular sensing matrices ( those with the same number of non - zero blocks in each row and column ) and then generalize the results to the case of irregular matrices .",
    "we can optimize the structure of the sensing matrix to maximize the fraction of spectrum holes that can be detected for a given number of measurements .",
    "we consider both noiseless and noisy scenarios in this work , and analyze the performance of the proposed algorithm in both cases .",
    "our analytical and simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in reliable detection of spectrum holes ( even when the number of measurements is relatively small ) with complexity that is negligible compared to the existing block sparse recovery algorithms such as amp - js .",
