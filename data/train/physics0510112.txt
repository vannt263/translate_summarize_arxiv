    "e.g. _ , relative price changes ( _ the return _ ) and returns standard deviation ( _ the volatility _ ) , have enabled the establishment of new models which characterise systems ever better  @xcite .",
    "along with the previous two quantities , another key observable is the number of stocks of a certain company traded in a given period of time , _ the traded volume _ , @xmath0 .",
    "in this article we analyse the dependence degree of @xmath1-minute traded volume time series , @xmath2 , of the constituents of the dow jones industrial average @xmath3 index ( dj30 ) , between the @xmath4 of july 2004 and the @xmath5 of december 2004 .",
    "we introduce also a dynamical mechanism that provides the same stationary pdf  @xcite . in order to avoid spurious features ,",
    "we have removed intra - day pattern of the original time series and normalised each element of the series by its mean value defining the normalised traded volume , @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 is defined as the average over time ( @xmath10 represents the intra - day time and @xmath11 the day ) .",
    "discrimination between two hypothesis , _ consistent testing _ , is ubiquitous in science .",
    "examples are the stationary / non - stationary character of time series or the dependence degree between its elements . concerning the latter , the most widely applied measure of `` dependence '' between variables is the correlation function mathematically defined as , @xmath12 = \\frac{\\left\\langle v\\left ( t\\right ) \\,v\\left ( t+\\tau \\right ) \\right\\rangle",

    "the correlation function is not able to determine conveniently non - linearities in a given group of data . aiming to consistently test the dependence or independence of stochastic variables",
    "it was recently defined a dependence measure that has been able to evaluate non - linearities , for instance , in daily return time series  @xcite and garch processes  @xcite for which the correlation function gives zero value .",

    "this index is optimal in the sense that the gradient of the measure @xmath31 is most sensitive and hence most capable of determine variations in the dependence among the variables .",
    "moreover , it is optimal because its two extreme values are associated to full dependence and full independence between @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
