    "three - body charmless non - leptonic @xmath4 decays provide good opportunities for searches on @xmath3 violation in weak interactions and for studies of hadronic physics .",
    "strong interaction phases are essential for the observation of @xmath3 violation and it is important to describe reliably the strong interaction between the detected hadrons . here",
    "we study the three - body @xmath5 decays for which babar and belle collaborations have carried out comprehensive dalitz plot analyses@xcite . for @xmath6 invariant masses , @xmath7 , below 1.8 gev one can observe the dominance of the vector @xmath8 and of the scalar @xmath9 resonances denoted hereafter as @xmath10 and @xmath11 .    even if some phenomenological parameters are necessary , the quantum chromodynamics , qcd , factorization approach describes well @xmath4 decays into two mesons@xcite .",
    "this factorization procedure is a leading order approximation in an expansion in inverse powers of the quark @xmath12 mass @xmath13 .",
    "so far no derivation of factorization exists for @xmath4 decays into three mesons .",
    "however , for @xmath14 gev and in the rest frame of the @xmath4 , the two mesons of the @xmath6 pair move roughly in the same direction .",
    "we refer such processes as @xmath15 and apply factorization to this quasi two - body @xmath4 decay . in a preceding work the @xmath16 decays ,",
    "the final state of which is dominated by the @xmath17 and @xmath18 resonances , were studied by some of us@xcite .",

    "the wilson coefficients @xmath26 , associated to the four - quarks operators @xmath27 , depend on the renormalization scale @xmath28 . for the @xmath29 process , and in the leading order of the factorization method",

    "the short - distance physics of the weak process @xmath35 enters into this coefficient .",
    "its leading order @xmath36 contribution @xmath37 depends on the nature of the produced meson @xmath38 which , within our quasi two - body approach , we approximate to be the @xmath11 for the @xmath2-@xmath39 wave or the @xmath10 for the @xmath2-@xmath40 wave .",

    "the transition @xmath49 is given in terms of the scalar and vector @xmath4 to @xmath50 form factors , @xmath51 , where the four - momentum is @xmath52 .",
    "they contain non - perturbative physics from hadronization of quark currents@xcite .",
    "their @xmath53 variation at low @xmath53 is small and we use @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the matrix element @xmath56 , given by the strange scalar and vector form factors @xmath57 , have also long - range physics contributions .",
    "they are calculated@xcite using analyticity , unitarity , qcd asymptotic counting rules and accurate experimental data on @xmath2 scattering in the elastic and inelastic domains .",
    "adding up the next important term @xmath58 and neglecting other smaller contributions , the @xmath59 amplitude is a sum of an @xmath39- and @xmath40- wave contributions , @xmath60 , with @xmath61 @xmath62 where @xmath63 with @xmath64 and @xmath65 or 6 , @xmath66 or @xmath44 .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath67 is inferred from the @xmath68 pseudoscalar - vector ( @xmath69 ) amplitudes@xcite .",
    "the vertex and penguin corrections are not sufficient to explain the decay rate @xmath70 and we have added four phenomenological complex parameters @xmath71 .",
    "these could be interpreted as non perturbative contributions in the penguin diagrams .    for the @xmath72 amplitude one",

    "the use of the strange form factors@xcite , constrained by experiments other than those from @xmath4 decays and by theory , is an alternative to the isobar model often used in the experimental analysis of the dalitz plots .",

    "we have looked at the effect of the next to leading order in @xmath92 , vertex and penguin correction in the framework of the qcd factorization , it would be interesting to include also hard spectator scattering and annihilation@xcite .",
