    ", it has received much attention because its features are difficult to explain if a simple @xmath1 bound state of the quark potential model is assumed @xcite .",
    "@xmath7 is one of the promising candidates of the exotic states reviewed in ref.@xcite .",
    "many kinds of structures have been suggested for the @xmath0(3872 ) from the theoretical side , such as a tetraquark structure @xcite , a @xmath22 molecule @xcite and a charmonium - molecule hybrid @xcite .",
    "we also employ this hybrid picture and argue that that is most appropriate .",
    "one of the important properties of the @xmath0(3872 ) is its isospin structure .",
    "the branching fractions measured by belle @xcite is @xmath31 and @xmath32 by @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "here the two - pion mode originates from the isovector @xmath33 meson while the three - pion mode comes from the isoscalar @xmath34 meson .",

    "( [ tt_eq:1_1 ] ) indicates strong isospin violation .",
    "m.  suzuki has estimated the kinematical suppression factor including the difference of the vector meson decay width and obtained the production amplitude ratio @xcite using belle s value @xmath35 usual size of the isospin symmetry breaking is at most a few % .",
    "it is interesting to know what is the origin of this strong isospin symmetry breaking . in @xcite ,",
    "this problem has been studied by using the chiral unitary model and the effect of the @xmath33-@xmath34 mixing has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "it was reported that both of the approaches can explain the observed ratio given in eq .",
    "( [ tt_eq:1_1 ] ) , but at present , consensus on the mechanism of the large isospin symmetry breaking has yet to be reached .",
    "we will show in this work that the mass difference of the @xmath36 and the @xmath37 thresholds gives enough amount of the isospin violation to explain the experiments .",
    "the production processes have been studied in @xcite .",
    "it seems that a pure molecule picture can not explain the production rate of the @xmath0(3872 ) in the @xmath38 collision well @xcite .",
    "there , the production rate of the @xmath0(3872 ) is about 1/20 of the rate of @xmath39 , which suggests that @xmath0(3872 ) has to have , by a very rough estimate , the order of 5% of the @xmath40 component .",
    "the hadronic decays of the @xmath0(3872 ) are investigated in @xcite . as for the radiative",
    "decays , as seen in @xcite , the existence of the core seems to be required , but the results depend on details of the wave function . here",
    "we assume that the @xmath40 core is created by the weak interaction in the @xmath41 decay as @xmath42 , and investigate the transfer strength from the @xmath40 to @xmath43 .",
    "we only investigate the hadronic mode and will discuss the radiative decay elsewhere .",
    "the @xmath0(3872 ) exists above the open charm threshold , @xmath44 .",
    "below this threshold , the @xmath45 mass spectrum is well predicted by a simple quark model . the model , however , failed to predict the masses above the open charm threshold for the @xmath44 or @xmath46 @xmath12-wave sector . in this work ,",
    "we also show that the @xmath40 peak above the threshold can actually disappear by introducing the @xmath40-@xmath43 coupling .",
    "it is also an important issue that whether the charged partner of the @xmath0(3872 ) exists as a measurable peak or not .",
    "@xmath14 has searched such a state in the @xmath47 channel and found no signal @xcite .",
    "the hybrid picture , where the coupling to the @xmath40 core is essential to bound the neutral @xmath0 , is consistent with the absence of the charged @xmath0 .",
    "recently , @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( @xmath50=@xmath51 ) resonances have been found in the @xmath52 decay to @xmath53 ( @xmath54=1,2,3 ) and @xmath55 ( @xmath56=1,2 ) reactions@xcite .",
    "the masses of these resonances are just above the @xmath57 and the @xmath58 thresholds , respectively ; the main component is considered to be the @xmath59 two - meson state .",
    "this means that there exists an almost - zero - energy bound state ( or resonance ) in each of the @xmath60 and the @xmath59 systems . in order to make such states , the attraction in the @xmath60 system",
    "is considered to be about 2.7 times as strong as that of the @xmath59 system because the reduced mass of the @xmath60 system , 967 mev , is about 2.7 times as light as that of the @xmath59 system , 2651 mev . on the other hand ,",
    "the interaction between the @xmath4 and @xmath61 mesons is probably about the same size as that between the @xmath62 and @xmath63 mesons .",
    "we argue that the extra attraction required for the @xmath7 comes , at least mainly , from its coupling to the @xmath40 core , which is absent in these isovector @xmath64 systems .    in this article",
    ", we present a hybrid picture where @xmath0(3872 ) is @xmath65 and consists of @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and the @xmath66 @xmath40 core , which stands for the @xmath11 if observed .",
    "a separable @xmath43 interaction is introduced , whose strength is determined so as to give a zero - energy bound state when it applied to the @xmath59 systems .",
    "the rest of the required attraction to form the @xmath0(3872 ) are assumed to come from the @xmath40-@xmath43 coupling .",
    "the coupling strength is determined so as to give the observed @xmath0(3872 ) mass .",
    "the @xmath40 core mass is taken from the quark model result , and the cutoff is chosen by considering the @xmath40 core size . as we will discuss later , the behaviors of the @xmath0(3872 ) do not depend strongly on the detail of the interactions .",
    "main parameters of the present model are the overall strength of the two - meson interaction and that of the coupling , which are essentially determined from the masses of @xmath0(3872 ) and @xmath64 s . this simple picture ,",
    "however , is found to be consistent with many of the experiments , such as the isospin symmetry breaking in the @xmath0(3872 ) decay , the production rate of @xmath0(3872 ) in the @xmath38 collision , and the absence of @xmath11 peak or the charged @xmath0 , in addition to the mass of @xmath0(3872 ) and @xmath64 s , which are the inputs .",
    "it should be noted here that the quark number is not the conserved quantity in qcd and our treatment of taking the @xmath8 and @xmath43 as the orthogonal states is an approximate one . in the low - energy qcd ,",
    "the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking occurs and the light quarks get the dynamical masses . in such a situation , the treatment of taking the @xmath8 and @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) as the orthogonal states seems to be acceptable , since these two states are energetically different . in order to study the structure of the exotic hadrons , how to count",
    "the quark number is an issue of the discussions .",
    "three methods have been proposed to observe the number of the valence quarks in the hadron .",
    "the first one is to measure the elliptic flow in relativistic heavy ion collisions @xcite while the second one is to measure the nuclear modification ratios in heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "the last one is to use the fragmentation functions @xcite .",
    "we hope some of these methods will be applied to the @xmath0(3872 ) and the quark component of the @xmath0(3872 ) will be determined experimentally .",
    "let us briefly mention features of our work in comparison to those that also employ the charmonium - molecule hybrid model @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the hybrid structure of the x(3872 ) has been studied in the qcd sum rule approach by considering a mixed charmonium - molecular current .",
    "they found a very deeply bound @xmath7 , @xmath69 gev , 97% of whose component is a charmonium .",
    "as we shall show in sec.[form ] , the structure of the @xmath7 certainly depends on the binding energy strongly . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the effective hadronic models with the charmonium-@xmath70 molecule transition interaction have been used as well as in the present work .",
    "danilkin and simonov have studied the @xmath70 production spectrum @xcite .",
    "they obtained the strength of the @xmath71-@xmath60 coupling from the heavy quarkonium decay calculated by a quark model with a small adjustment .",
    "they certainly found a steep rise near the threshold .",
    "we have studied the @xmath72 or @xmath73 weak decay spectrum at almost same time independently in the very similar approach in @xcite . here",
    ", we also introduce the interaction between @xmath4 and @xmath61 , and look into the features of the shallowly bound @xmath7 . the work in ref .",
    "@xcite they examined the effects of the okubo - zweig - iizuka forbidden @xmath74 and @xmath75 channels . since the main decay modes of the @xmath7 are the @xmath76 and @xmath77 , their inclusion is certainly important .",
    "as shown in @xcite , however , this effect on the pole position seems rather small . to avoid the complication we discuss it elsewhere . in the present study ,",
    "we have introduced the attractive interaction between @xmath4 and @xmath78 mesons with the coupling strength being consistent with the observed @xmath79 and @xmath80 masses .",
    "this point is new to the previous two studies and we consider that we can successfully draw the consistent picture of the observed exotic hadrons @xmath7 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 .    one of the authors ( s. t. ) has studied the @xmath0(3872 ) using a quark potential model by introducing an extra ( @xmath81 ) pair to a @xmath1 system @xcite and found a shallow bound state of @xmath82 with @xmath25 .",
    "recently , an elaborate study has been done in the quark potential model @xcite .",
    "they have performed the coupled channel calculations including two and four - quark configurations using the @xmath83 model and found a good agreement with the experimental data .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to make the situation of the @xmath0(3872 ) clearer by studying the role of the @xmath1 core state , which couples to the @xmath22 and @xmath84 molecular states , with a simple hadronic model .",
    "this approach will complement the picture given by the quark model approach .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.[form ] , the calculation of the @xmath0(3872 ) state is given . in sec.[spectra ] , we discuss the transition strength of the weak decay of b meson : @xmath85 or @xmath73 using the green s function approach . in sec.[ddint ] , we study the effects of the interaction between the @xmath4 and  mesons .",
    "we discuss the possibility of the other exotic hadrons by the present mechanism in sec.[exotichadrons ] .",
    "finally , sec.[conc ] is devoted to summary of this paper .",
    "we argue that the @xmath0(3872 ) state is a superposition of the @xmath1 core state , the @xmath22 hadronic molecular state , and the @xmath84 hadronic molecular states .",
    "so , the wave function of the @xmath0(3872 ) in the center of the mass frame is represented by @xmath86 the @xmath22 and @xmath84 molecular states are given by @xmath87 where @xmath88 represents the relative momentum of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 mesons .",
    "the normalization of the states are @xmath89 here @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the momentum representation of the wave functions of the @xmath22 and @xmath84 hadronic molecular states , respectively .",
    "the charge conjugation is assumed to be positive throughout this paper .",
    "we assume these three states ( @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 ) are the orthonormal states . if @xmath93 and @xmath94 are the spatially wide objects , this assumption seems to be reasonable . as we shall show in fig .",
    "[ tt_fig:2_1 ] , indeed @xmath93 and @xmath94 are the wide objects .",
    "we introduce a coupling between the @xmath1 core state and the @xmath95 states in the isospin symmetric manner .",
    "since we are looking into the low energy region , the results do not depend much on the shape of the interaction .",
    "thus , we take a monopole - type coupling as : @xmath96 the interaction we have introduced above causes effectively an attraction for the @xmath0(3872 ) because its energy is lower than the mass of the @xmath40 core , @xmath97 . in this section",
    ", we ignore the direct interactions between the @xmath4 and @xmath61 mesons ; as we will discuss later in sec.[ddint ] , the coupling to the @xmath40 core seems more important to make the @xmath0(3872 ) than the direct @xmath43 attraction .",
    "here we consider only the relative @xmath12-wave states of these two mesons in the non - relativistic scheme because the @xmath0(3872 ) is close to the threshold . the schrdinger equation to solve is @xmath98 with @xmath99",
    "since the interaction we employ is separable , we can solve this schrdinger equation analytically .",
    "the bound state energy is obtained by solving the following equation .",
    "@xmath100 with @xmath101 and @xmath102    for later convenience , we define @xmath103 and @xmath104 by @xmath105 and @xmath106 where @xmath107 represents the observed mass of the @xmath0(3872 ) .    in order to obtain the numerical results , we use the @xmath4 meson masses given in the 2012 review of particle physics @xcite ( table [ tbl : masses ] ) . since we have introduced the isospin symmetric interaction @xmath108 in eq .",
    "( [ tt_eq:2_5 ] ) , the only origin of the isospin violation in the present model is the mass difference between the charged and neutral @xmath4 and @xmath109 mesons .",
    ".meson masses and the thresholds .",
    "all the entries are in gev . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tbl : others ]    in this section , we discuss the possibility to apply the present method to investigate the existence of other exotic hadrons as well as the absence of the @xmath110 states above the threshold .",
    "if there is a charmonium or a bottomonium state ( @xmath110 ) above the @xmath111 and the @xmath112 meson threshold and if the quantum numbers of the system allows @xmath110 to couple to those two mesons , then this coupling causes the effective attraction between the two mesons by the same mechanism as the present approach .",
    "moreover , if the coupling occurs in @xmath12-wave , the effective attraction can be larger and the @xmath110 state gains a large decay width .    for the overview",
    ", we show the observed mass spectra of @xmath113 and @xmath114 with the quark model results for the @xmath115 systems in table [ tbl : others ] with the lowest @xmath12-wave threshold of the @xmath111 and the @xmath112 mesons .",
    "the potential in the quark model consists of the color - coulomb , linear confinement , and the color - spin interactions .",
    "the values of the parameters in the interactions are taken from @xcite .",
    "since we have neglected the spin - orbit interaction and the tensor terms , all of the obtained masses of the @xmath116 are the same .",
    "one can see from the table that the observed states below the @xmath12-wave threshold roughly correspond to those calculated by the quark model . above the threshold ,",
    "however , simple @xmath110 states are not observed any more . we argue that they disappear because they have a large width due to the coupling to the two - meson scattering states .    from the @xmath0(3872 ) case",
    ", we have learned that the @xmath110 state by about 80 mev above the threshold can contribute to form such an exotic state assuming that the size of the coupling is similar to the @xmath0(3872 ) case .",
    "let us check whether such a state exists in the other systems .",
    "first we discuss the @xmath117 , ( @xmath118 , 1 , 2 ) bottomonia , @xmath119 .",
    "the observed masses are ( @xmath120 ) mev and ( @xmath121 ) mev , @xmath122 and @xmath123 , respectively , ( @xmath124 ) mev and ( @xmath125 ) mev for the @xmath126 and @xmath127 , respectively , and ( @xmath128 ) mev and ( @xmath129 ) mev for the @xmath130 and @xmath131 , respectively .",
    "the second radially excited state has been found at ( @xmath132 ) mev , and the observed peak is the mixture of @xmath133 .",
    "the threshold of the @xmath134 [ @xmath135 scattering states is 10559 [ 10604 ] mev , which is by 29 [ 74 ] mev above the @xmath136 mass and by 232 [ 187 ] mev below the calculated @xmath137 mass .",
    "since the threshold is much closer to the @xmath136 than to the @xmath137 , the effects of the @xmath138 states on the the @xmath41 and @xmath139 interaction will probably be repulsive at around the threshold .",
    "as for the the @xmath140 and @xmath141 systems , the threshold sits in the middle of the @xmath142 and @xmath143 states , and the energy differences are about 120 - 140 mev .",
    "the @xmath144 effects are expected to be small in this case .",
    "we next investigate the @xmath145 charmonium states .",
    "the ground state is @xmath146 , and its mass is ( @xmath147 ) mev .",
    "the @xmath148 state has not been observed and the theoretical estimation of its mass is 3920 mev @xcite , whose mass is by 44 mev lighter than our calculation due to the noncentral force .",
    "the main @xmath12-wave decay channel of the @xmath148 state is the @xmath149 , whose thresholds is 3730 mev .",
    "the @xmath71 state is by about 200 mev above the threshold ; its effects may be attractive , but the size is probably small .    as for the @xmath150 charmonia",
    ", the situation is different from the @xmath151 or @xmath30 charmonia . in this channel , the first radially excited state ,",
    "@xmath152 , has been observed , while only the ground states have been observed in the @xmath151 and @xmath30 channels .",
    "the reason of this difference is simple in the present picture .",
    "the @xmath153 channel can couple only to the @xmath109 @xmath154 systems in @xmath12-wave ; their threshold , 4014 mev , is rather high and 87 mev above the @xmath152 mass .",
    "the calculated mass of the @xmath155 is 4325 mev , which is about 300 mev above the @xmath109 @xmath154 threshold .",
    "so , its effects may be repulsive in this channel .    in summary , the @xmath0(3872 )",
    "is found to be surprisingly special .",
    "although there may be exotic hadrons with the higher partial wave , or one has to consider the rearrangement meson channels such as @xmath110-@xmath156 systems , the @xmath71 @xmath30 channel seems the only promising candidate to form an @xmath12-wave exotic hadron by the present mechanism : a hybrid state of the charmonium and the hadronic molecule .",
    "in this work , we have studied the structure of the @xmath0(3872 ) as well as the transfer strength from the @xmath40 core to the @xmath43 scattering state .",
    "the system consists of @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and the @xmath66 @xmath40 core , which stands for the @xmath11 if observed .",
    "we have introduced the direct interaction between the two mesons , which is just as attractive as the one which makes a zero - energy bound state if applied to the @xmath59 system .",
    "namely , we assume that this two - meson interaction gives the @xmath64(10610 ) and @xmath64(10650 ) resonances .",
    "this interaction , however , is not strong enough to make a bound state in the @xmath43 systems alone . in this model ,",
    "the coupling between the @xmath1 core and the @xmath43 two - meson state is also introduced , which effectively produces the attraction between the @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "we assume that this coupling provides the rest of the attraction required to make a bound state in the @xmath43 system , @xmath0(3872 ) .",
    "both of the interaction and the coupling are assumed to be isospin independent .",
    "the isospin symmetry breaking in this model solely comes from the mass difference between the neutral and charged @xmath4 and the @xmath109 mesons .    in the obtained wave function of the @xmath0(3872 ) , there is about 6% of the @xmath1 core component .",
    "this size is consistent with a rough estimate from the @xmath0(3872 ) production rate in the @xmath10 collision . as for the @xmath95 components of the @xmath0(3872 ) wave function ,",
    "69% is isoscalar and 26% is isovector ; the ratio of the isovector to the isoscalar @xmath95 components is also consistent with the experiments of the final @xmath157 to @xmath158 decay ratio .",
    "the present work shows that the structure of the @xmath7 is not a simple @xmath45 nor a simple @xmath22 bound state .",
    "it is charmonium - hadronic molecule hybrid , which is certainly an exotic state .    since the @xmath1 core can not couple to the charged @xmath95 states , such as @xmath159 ,",
    "the present picture can explain why there exists no charged partners of the @xmath0(3872 ) .",
    "also , it can explain why the @xmath66@xmath40 core , or @xmath11 , is not found experimentally though it has been predicted by the quark model which gives correct mass spectrum below the open charm threshold ; this core couples strongly to the @xmath43 two - meson state and becomes a resonance with a very broad width .    in order to confirm the present picture of the @xmath7",
    ", we consider that the inclusion of the @xmath160 and @xmath75 channels is important because the @xmath7 is mainly observed in the @xmath161 and @xmath162 channels .",
    "we are now performing such calculations and the results will be reported soon .    recently , belle collaboration reported the results of the radiative decays of the @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "they searched the @xmath163 in b decays , but no significant signal has been found . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath14 collaboration has reported that @xmath164 is almost 3 times that of @xmath165 @xcite .",
    "to make the situation clear , it is useful to calculate the radiative decays of the @xmath7 in the present model including the charmonium structure",
