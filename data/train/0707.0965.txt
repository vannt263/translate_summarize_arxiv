    "metal - insulator transitions in hubbard models with different densities of states have attracted a lot of interest in recent years [ 1 - 10 ] .",
    "a dispute arose over the question whether or not the transition occurs at different interaction strengths for the wide and the narrow band . a transition with different critical interaction parameters is usually denoted as an ` orbital selective mott transition ' ( osmt ) .",
    "apparently , a consensus has been reached that such an osmt can occur in hubbard models with different bandwidths , subject to the bandwidth ratio @xmath0 of the narrow and the wide band and the value of the local exchange interaction @xmath1 .    in most of the calculations in",
    "[ 1 - 10 ] the dynamical mean - field theory has been employed .",
    "we will use multiband gutzwiller wave functions in order to study the osmt .",
    "such wave functions were originally introduced by gutzwiller  @xcite in order to study ferromagnetism in the one - band hubbard model .",
    "the evaluation of expectation values for the gutzwiller wave function poses a difficult many - particle problem .",
    "therefore , gutzwiller , in his original work , used an approximation based on quasi - classical counting arguments @xcite .",
    "this ` gutzwiller approximation ' later turned out to be equivalent to an exact evaluation of expectation values in the limit of infinite spatial dimension or infinite coordination number .",
    "generalised gutzwiller wave function for multi - band hubbard models have first been introduced and evaluated in the limit of infinite spacial dimensions in reference @xcite .",
    "the formalism was further generalised , e.g. , for superconducting systems , in references @xcite .",
    "the osmt in a two - band hubbard model has first been investigated by means of the gutzwiller theory in reference @xcite . in that work",
    "the authors found an osmt both for vanishing ( @xmath2 ) as well as for finite ( @xmath3 ) local exchange interaction .",
    "for @xmath2 the critical band width ratio was found to be @xmath4 .",
    "the gutzwiller results in @xcite were in good agreement with data from dmft and a slave - spin approach proposed in reference @xcite .",
    "in this work we will analyse the osmt in a two - band model in more detail .",
    "in particular , we permit a finite expectation value @xmath5 for the local hybridisation which can change the nature of the osmt . such a hybridisation could be finite spontaneously , solely due to the coulomb interaction , or due to a finite hybridisation term in the hamiltonian .",
    "we will investigate both possibilities .",
    "our paper is organised as follows : the two - band hubbard models are introduced in section  [ ms ] . in section  [ gwf ]",
    "we define generalised gutzwiller wave functions and give the results for the variational ground - state energy for these wave functions in the limit of infinite spatial dimensions .",
    "the orbital selective mott transition in a two - band model without a finite local hybridisation is discussed numerically , and as far as possible analytically , in section  [ tosmtiathm ] . in section  [ tbm ]",
    "we investigate analytically the spontaneous hybridisation in a spinless two - band model .",
    "finally , the hybridisation effects in the full two - band are studied in section [ htbm ] , and a summary closes our presentation in section  [ sum ] .",
    "[ sec : hamilt ] in this work we investigate the two - band hubbard model @xmath6 here , the one particle hamiltonian @xmath7 describes the hopping of electrons with spin @xmath8 on a lattice with @xmath9 sites .",
    "the index @xmath10 labels the two degenerate orbitals at each lattice site .",
    "we assume that the hopping amplitudes @xmath11 depend on the orbital index @xmath12 only via overall bandwidth factors @xmath13 .",
    "this leads to an orbital - dependent renormalisation @xmath14 of the bare density of states @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the fourier - transform of @xmath17 . throughout this work , only symmetric densities of states",
    "will be considered @xmath18 .",
    "we will study the two - band model ( [ ms1 ] ) with and without spin - degrees of freedom .",
    "for the full two - band model we assume that the orbitals have an @xmath19-symmetry .",
    "the atomic hamiltonian then reads @xmath20 where in cubic symmetry the two parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 are determined by @xmath23 and @xmath24 . without spin , the atomic hamiltonian @xmath25 simply reads @xmath26 where the effective hubbard interaction in this model can be derived from the interorbital coulomb ( @xmath21 ) and exchange ( @xmath1 ) interaction through @xmath27 .",
    "apparently , the spinless two - band model is mathematically equivalent to a one - band model with a spin - dependent density of states . in the limit @xmath28",
    "it becomes a falicov - kimball model .",
    "both atomic hamiltonians ( [ ms3 ] ) and ( [ ms4 ] ) can be readily diagonalised @xmath29 the eigenstates @xmath30 of @xmath31 are the empty state @xmath32 , the two singly occupied states @xmath33 and the doubly occupied state @xmath34 .",
    "the diagonalisation of @xmath35 leads to similar slater - determinants for all particle numbers @xmath36 . in the two - particle sector , @xmath37 ,",
    "one finds the triplet ground - state with energy @xmath38 , in agreement with hund s first rule , and three singlet states with energies @xmath39 ( doubly degenerate ) and @xmath40 ; for more details , see reference @xcite .",
    "in order to study the two - band hubbard models introduced in section [ ms ] , we use gutzwiller variational wave functions @xcite which are defined as @xmath41 here , @xmath42 is a normalised one - particle wave function and the local correlation operator @xmath43 has the form @xmath44 for each lattice site @xmath45 , and @xmath46 the real coefficients @xmath47 and the one - particle wave function @xmath42 are variational parameters . for systems without superconductivity",

    "due to these symmetries the correlation operator ( [ gwf2 ] ) contains up to 5 variational parameters for @xmath31 and up to 26 for @xmath35 .    throughout this work we will investigate the half - filled case of our model systems and",

    "unlike in the spinless model , there is not necessarily a finite hybridisation if the effective narrow bandwidth goes to zero for @xmath157 .",

    "a finite hybridisation @xmath135 sets in at larger values of @xmath84 when the system is already in the osmt phase , see figure [ fig7a ]",
