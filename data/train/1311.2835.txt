    "it therefore suffices to prove finiteness up to @xmath39 for splittings @xmath2 which refine @xmath122 .    when @xmath2 has just one more edge than @xmath122 , we simply apply lemma [ lem_tf1 ] to @xmath122 , noting that any @xmath55 which is not virtually polycyclic or qh is rigid , hence elliptic in @xmath2 .",
    "in general , we pass from @xmath122 to @xmath2 by a finite sequence of one - edge refinements . refining a qh vertex yields vertex groups which are virtually cyclic or qh , so lemma [ lem_tf1 ] applies to each intermediate splitting .",

    "let @xmath59 be the bass - serre tree of @xmath62 , and @xmath293 the induced collapse map .",
    "we first claim that the number of edges of @xmath62 is uniformly bounded . to prove this , we consider a vertex @xmath56 of @xmath290 such that @xmath294 is not a point , and we have to bound the number of edges of @xmath295 .",

    "there may be redundant vertices , but such vertices have edges of @xmath290 attached to them , so the number of @xmath55-orbits of redundant vertices is bounded by the valence of the image of @xmath56 in @xmath122 .",

    "it follows that @xmath304 is elliptic in @xmath201 , and we define @xmath307 .",
    "if @xmath201 dominates @xmath2 , we may obtain the bass - serre tree of @xmath2 from that of @xmath201 by collapsing edges and performing a finite sequence of folds @xmath308 ( see @xcite ) .",

    "the following generalization was inspired by n.  touikan .",
    "if @xmath0 is as in lemma [ dom ] , and @xmath2 is a splitting of @xmath0 over groups with finitely many ends , there is a non - trivial splitting of @xmath0 over a finite group in which all edge groups @xmath311 of @xmath2 are elliptic .",
    "this is proved by induction : the lemma is true in a relative setting , and one applies it relative to @xmath312 to the one - edge splitting of @xmath0 over @xmath313 .",
    "let now @xmath0 be as in theorem [ main ] .",
    "let @xmath2 be a non - trivial one - edge splitting of @xmath0 , say an amalgam @xmath3 ( the argument is the same in the case of an hnn - extension ) . by section [ feg ] and the first assertion of lemma [ relpolycy ]",
    ", we may assume that @xmath304 is infinite .",
    "it is virtually cyclic or abelian , hence finitely ended .    by lemma 3.2 of @xcite , we can refine @xmath2 to a splitting @xmath123 which dominates the splitting @xmath62 provided by lemma [ dom ] ( but we can not assume that @xmath123 collapses to @xmath62 ) .",
    "we may assume that all edge groups of @xmath123 are finite , except for the edge @xmath314 coming from @xmath2 ( it carries @xmath304 ) .",
    "the number of edges of @xmath123 is bounded by linnell s accessibility .",
    "all vertex groups of @xmath123 except @xmath55 and @xmath174 are vertex groups of a splitting of @xmath0 with finite edge groups , so only finitely many isomorphism types are possible by section [ feg ] .",

    "first suppose that @xmath0 is torsion - free .",

    "finiteness follows .",
    "now assume that @xmath0 has torsion ( so is as in assertion 2 or 3 of theorem [ main ] ) .",
    "there are two complications .",
    "first , one must replace the rank by another complexity , namely @xmath317 , defined as the maximal number of edges in a minimal decomposition of @xmath11 over finite groups without redundant vertex ( minimal means that the action on the bass - serre is minimal , as in subsection [ ts ] ) .",
    "this is finite by linnell s accessibility , and @xmath318 , so we can argue by induction on @xmath317 .",
    "the groups @xmath48 and @xmath81 are now fundamental groups of graphs of groups such that the number of edges is bounded , and only finitely many vertex and edge groups are possible up to isomorphism .",
    "we have to control the inclusions of edge groups into vertex groups .",
    "we can not argue as in the proof of lemma [ sk2 ] because we do not know the deformation space .",
    "instead we use the fact that the vertex groups are hyperbolic relative to virtually polycyclic groups , and therefore only contain finitely many conjugacy classes of finite subgroups by the first assertion of lemma [ relpolycy ] .",
    "we now prove assertions 2 , 3 , 4 of theorem [ main ] in full generality , i.e.   for splittings with any number of edges . recall that we need only consider reduced splittings .",
    "we first prove the following claim by induction on @xmath155 : _ given @xmath0 , there are only finitely many possible isomorphism types for vertex groups of reduced splittings @xmath2 of @xmath0 over @xmath1 with at most @xmath155 edges .",
    "_    given a vertex @xmath56 of @xmath2 , choose an edge @xmath57 containing @xmath56 , and collapse @xmath57 .",
    "we get a reduced splitting @xmath62 with fewer edges , and @xmath55 is a vertex group of a one - edge splitting of a vertex group @xmath174 of @xmath62 .",
    "this one - edge splitting is reduced because @xmath2 is reduced , and the claim follows since by induction there are finitely many possibilities for @xmath174 up to isomorphism .",
    "if @xmath0 is finitely presented , bestvina - feighn s accessibility @xcite provides a bound for the number of edges of reduced splittings of @xmath0 ( note that groups in @xmath1 are small , and reduced as defined in subsection [ ts ] implies reduced in the sense of @xcite ) .",
    "theorem [ main ] thus follows from the claim when @xmath0 is relatively hyperbolic ( assertions 2 and 3 ) .",
    "bestvina - feighn s accessibility does not apply in the csa case if @xmath0 is not finitely presented , so we use acylindrical accessibility @xcite instead . as usual",
    ", an abelian splitting is a splitting over abelian groups .",
    "let @xmath0 be a finitely generated , torsion - free , csa group .",
    "given an abelian splitting @xmath2 of @xmath0 , there exists a reduced 2-acylindrical abelian splitting @xmath319 such that any non - abelian vertex group of @xmath2 is a vertex group of @xmath319 .",
