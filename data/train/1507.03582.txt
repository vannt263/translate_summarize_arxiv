    "in recent years it has been assumed that the majority , if not all , large galaxies house at their cores a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) ranging from many hundreds of thousands to billions of times the mass of our sun ( see the recent review by * ? ? ?",
    "these objects strongly influence , or are strongly influenced by , the properties of their hosts , as evidenced by certain galaxy - wide properties scaling with the masses of these smbhs , such as in the m-@xmath9 relation @xcite .",
    "however , the cause of this link is not well understood . in order to better understand the smbh demographic ( particularly at the low mass end where samples are of very limited size , see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , and their co - evolution with their hosts , further examples must be studied in dwarf and distant galaxies .    however , in the case of a distant / dwarf galaxy lacking an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) , even confirming the existence of an smbh can be difficult .",
    "obtaining spatially resolved velocity dispersion measurements across the the galaxy , looking for the gravitational influence of a massive central body , becomes impossible with current instrumentation when the angular size of the galaxy becomes too small .",
    "the detection and correct identification of a tidal disruption flare ( tdf ) , however , unequivocally shows the existence of an smbh within the flare s host , irrespective of the host s angular size or apparent magnitude .    a tdf is the luminous burst produced by the capture , disruption and subsequent accretion of a star onto a smbh .",
    "they are typically characterised by a short - lived ( months to years ) transient with a high temperature ( @xmath10 k ) thermal spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "they occur whenever a star passes within its tidal radius of the central smbh ( @xmath11 ) while remaining outside of the schwarzschild radius ( @xmath12 ) @xcite , since crossing the latter would lead to the star being swallowed whole and thus produce no visible flare . since @xmath13 and @xmath14 , for a given radius ( and mass ) of star , there exists a maximum black hole mass for which the disruption will occur outside @xmath15 ( although in practice the spin of the black hole is also important , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "hence white dwarfs will only be disrupted by intermediate mass black holes ( @xmath16 m@xmath17 ) , while main sequence stars can produce flares with black holes up to @xmath18 m@xmath17 and giants may be disrupted even around the most massive known black holes , though the likely accretion rates and timescales are much longer than for more compact systems @xcite .",
    "ultimately , observations of confirmed tidal flares may offer a new approach to measurements of black hole masses @xcite and spins @xcite .",
    "a number of tdf candidates have been found in the uv ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , soft x - rays ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the optical ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , most of these were detected at low redshift , often less than @xmath19 due to the necessity of multi - epoch photometry and astrometry , and the relatively shallow surveys from which they were selected .",
    "probing these events to much greater distances , thus providing a way to characterise the smbh mass distribution as a function of redshift , would require much more sensitive , high cadence surveys ( such as the lsst , * ? ? ? * ) or possibly chance gravitational lensing events ( e.g. the z=3.3 candidate , * ? ? ?",
    "however , a new sub - class of these events , potentially observable out to much larger distances with current observing platforms , has provided us with a new way to observe these transients .",
    "the first such event _ swift _",
    "j164449.3 + 573451 ( henceforth _ swift _",
    "j1644 + 57 ) , detected in 2011 march , exhibited extremely unusual high energy behaviour .",
    "detected initially as a gamma - ray burst ( grb ) trigger with a long duration ( @xmath71000s , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the event remained bright and variable for several days , retriggering _",
    "swift_/bat on a further three occasions over the course of 48 hours @xcite making it clear this was not a standard grb , short or long .",
    "x - ray monitoring with _ swift_/xrt showed a luminous flaring source that settled into a several - day long plateau before following an approximately power law decay , all with considerable short - term variability superimposed upon it .",
    "the source was discovered to lie at a cosmological distance , coincident with the centre ( @xmath20 pc to @xmath21 ) of a faint star - forming host at a spectroscopically confirmed redshift of @xmath22 @xcite , implying the isotropic x - ray luminosity of the event was @xmath23 even at late times .",
    "in contrast , the coincident optical / infrared transient peaked at a more modest @xmath24 even after correction for moderate internal extinction @xcite .",
    "radio observations of _ swift _ j1644 + 57 with the evla detected a rising unresolved source with an equipartition radius that implied a moderately relativistic expansion with lorentz factor @xmath25 and a formation epoch that coincided with the initial @xmath0-ray detection @xcite .",
    "the energetics measured by @xcite , @xmath26 erg at 22 days post burst , also corresponded to the eddington luminosity for accretion onto a @xmath27 black hole . @xcite used a purely observational relation between x - ray luminosity , radio luminosity and the mass of black holes ( ranging from high mass seyferts to stellar mass black holes ) to estimate the mass of the smbh that produced _ swift _",
    "j1644 + 57 .",
    "the resulting weak constraint of @xmath28 , was consistent with the black hole mass of @xmath29 estimated by @xcite via the spheroid mass - black hole mass scaling relation of @xcite .",
    "these unique broadband properties marked _ swift _",
    "j1644 + 57 as a new class of transient .",
    "they suggested the detection of a flare situated in the nuclear region of a dwarf galaxy with energetics and short - term variability consistent with an accretion event onto the central smbh .",
    "but the lack of any previous activity in @xmath0-rays during the lifetime of swift @xcite , the spectroscopic classification of the galaxy as star - forming @xcite and the radio formation epoch @xcite all indicated the accretion event was new and not part of any ongoing nuclear activity .",
    "thus , the favoured explanation was taken to be that of the tidal disruption of a solar - type star that had also launched a moderately relativistic jet .",
    "however , this relativistic tidal disruption flare ( rtdf ) interpretation was not unchallenged , and other mechanisms , perhaps involving the tidal capture of a white dwarf @xcite or massive star core collapse @xcite , were postulated .",
    "a second example , _ swift _ j2058.4 + 0516 ( _ swift",
    "_ j2058 + 05 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , was detected in may 2011 . while apparently much fainter than _ swift _",
    "j1644 + 57 , this was largely due to the much greater redshift ( @xmath30 , c.f .",
    "@xmath31 for _ swift _ j1644 + 57 ) and this was in fact a more luminous event .",
    "the bulk properties ( peak luminosity , total energy , longevity , steep late - time cut - off ) of the event matched well with those of _ swift _",
    "j1644 + 57 @xcite although there were several important differences .",
    "the x - ray lightcurve decline was steeper ( a power law with index @xmath32 , while _ swift _ j1644 + 57 was remarkably near the theoretical @xmath33 @xcite , although recent numerical simulations suggest that accounting for stellar structure and closeness of approach , -2.2 is expected in half of all disruptions @xcite ) and the x - ray spectrum was somewhat harder ( photon index @xmath34 , c.f .",
    "@xmath35 ) .",
    "in addition , the observed radio spectrum of _ swift _ j2058 + 05 was very flat ( @xmath36 ) which constrasts strongly with the optically thick spectrum ( @xmath37 ) of _ swift _ j1644 + 57 @xcite . despite these differences ,",
    "it was suggested that _ swift _ j2058 + 0516 is the second member of the rtdf class , and in this case the observational differences may offer important diagnostics of the disruption process .",
    "another potentially related class of transient is that of the ultra - long grbs ( ulgrbs , @xcite ) .",
    "these events exhibit @xmath38ray emission lasting for thousands of seconds ( 1 - 2 orders of magnitude less than the flares described above , but an order of magnitude longer than most grbs ) . while multiple possible paths to their creation have been suggested ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is also possible that they are related to tdfs with a relativistic component , although in this case their shorter timescales would imply a white dwarf disruption @xcite .",
    "relativistic tdfs are potentially observable out to much greater distances than their non - relativistic thermal tdf cousins due to their beamed emission , analogous to how grbs have been shown to be detectable to extreme redshifts ( e.g. grb090423 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite estimated that _ swift",
    "_ j1644 + 57 would have been observable out to @xmath39 , while the redshift of _ swift _ j2058 + 05 @xcite ( @xmath40 ) shows certain members may be observable at even larger distances .",
    "@xcite suggest that the radio component would be detectable out to @xmath41 , potentially making large scale radio surveys a powerful method for the detection of these events .",
    "such rtdfs also evolve on very short timescales compared to agn and so offer a way to study jetted accretion events across their whole lifetimes on human timescales , evidenced by observations of _ swift _ j1644 + 57 showing that the jet has now apparently shut - off @xcite .",
    "this is a virtual impossibility in the vastly longer lived agn duty cycles which may last in excess of @xmath42 years ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , the relativistic jets emitted by these events have been suggested as a possible source of ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .    given",
    "the potential importance of studying these events , it is concerning that it is unclear whether _ swift _ j2058 + 05",
    "would have attracted such detailed follow - up in the absence of _ swift _ j1644 + 57 , considering to its less immediately impressive nature .",
    "in addition , the notable temporal coincidence of the two bursts , being only two months apart in the then @xmath43 years that swift had been operating , led to the suggestion at the time that further examples within the _ swift _ archive may have been overlooked ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    here we present observations of _ swift _ j1112.2 - 8238 ( henceforth _ swift _ j1112 - 8238 ) which was detected by the _",
    "burst alert telescope in 2011 june and whose nature has to date been uncertain .",
    "our spectroscopic observations establish a cosmological redshift for the transient , and we demonstrate optical variability close to the nucleus of a faint galaxy . we analyse the inferred physical properties , comparing them to the properties of previous _ swift _ flare classifications including the recently discovered ultra - long grbs , and to the established relativistic tdf candidates , leading us to suggest that _ swift _ j1112 - 8238 is also a candidate rtdf .",

    "however , while the x - ray luminosity of the brightest blazar flares can reach the levels observed in _ swift _ j1112 - 8238 , this is generally accompanied by optical emission many magnitudes brighter than presented here , as seen in figure [ fig : x - ray - opt ] .",
    "in addition , our late - time x - ray limit places constraints on any underlying activity to a limit of l@xmath117ergs@xmath4 , fainter than the majority of quasars .",

    "the stellar mass to black hole mass scaling relation of @xcite , produces a lower estimate for the smbh mass of @xmath124m@xmath17 ( although there is considerable scatter in this relation and it is unclear whether the relation is applicable to such low masses ) which is approximately consistent with the result obtained using the method from @xcite of @xmath125 ( by assuming that the stellar mass estimate represents an upper limit on the bulge mass of the host ) .",

    "further , while often @xmath129 is taken to be the time at which the flare becomes observable , the true @xmath129 occurs some time earlier at the point of return of the most bound material which may precede emission by several days . in order to be consistent with a @xmath130 decay , the `` true '' @xmath129 would have to have been @xmath131 before the start of the _ swift _ detection image .",
    "this may not be unreasonable , since _ swift _",
    "j1644 + 57 was active at least 4 days prior to its first grb trigger , and had a @xmath132 detection on a single day , 14 days earlier @xcite .",
    "constraints on @xmath129 have been attempted in detailed models of previous flares ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "calculations considering more detailed transport of material through the disc point to a more complex picture , in which the t@xmath128 decline is only present in certain bands and over a rather restricted range of time @xcite , while even more recent calculations suggest that the @xmath133 decay seen in _ swift _",

    "unfortunately the brightness of the source precludes timing at much higher resolution , and so light - travel time arguments would only place weak constraints on the size of the emitting region ( @xmath137 cm , or 100 @xmath15 for a @xmath138 m@xmath17 black hole ) .",
    "more compellingly , the gamma ray emission at the time of the first xrt observations is close to the eddington luminosity of a 10@xmath139m@xmath17 black hole , and an extrapolation to early times suggests it was brighter still .",
    "the expected black hole mass is a factor of several hundred small than this , it is unlikely that a black hole could accrete at such high super - eddington rates , so while the constraints on beaming are weaker than for _ swift _ j1644 + 57 we still believe this is the most likely explanation for _ swift _ j1112 - 8238 .",
    "the lack of more comprehensive optical follow - up precludes the building of an optical sed which would help distinguish between the thermal seds of previous tdfs , ( e.g. asassn-14ae , @xcite ; ps1 - 10jh , @xcite ) , for which the peak absolute magnitudes are loosely consistent , and the differing , non - thermal emission mechanisms suggested in @xcite and @xcite for rtdf candidates .",
    "one of these models involves a blazar - analogue combination of inverse compton emission at high frequencies ( x - ray/@xmath0 ) with a second peak at low frequencies ( optical etc . ) from synchotron emission .",
    "alternatively the emission in different wavebands may come from spatially separate emission regions . in the lightcurves of _",

    "this is approximately consistent with 3 ( 10 ) times the tidal radius of a of sun - like star around a @xmath42m@xmath144 black hole .",
    "this result is similar to those obtained from analysis of optical tdfs , perhaps unsurprisingly as the optical luminosity of _ swift _ j1112 - 82 is only a factor of a few higher than seen in some other tdfs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this may suggest a common mechanism for the optical emission from both relativistic and thermal tdfs .",
    "it is also interesting to note _ swift _ j1112 - 8238 shows a sharp decline in its x - ray flux at @xmath145 days post trigger .",
    "this may be indicative of dipping as seen in _ swift _ j1644 + 57 @xcite at similar times , or perhaps of a longer term cessation of activity as identified in _ swift _ j1644 + 57 at much later epochs of @xmath98 years @xcite and similarly in _ swift _",
    "j2058 + 05 @xcite . in any case , the final epoch of observations results in a limit which is significantly below the extrapolation of the early emission , requiring either a steepening of the decay or a rapid drop .",
    "this suggests broad similarities between the different events , although the sparse sampling of _ swift _ j1112 - 8238 , makes it difficult to rule out alternate interpretations .    with the previous rtdf candidates , a variable radio source with a measured lorentz factor of @xmath35 or higher",

    "the consistency of these positions makes an association of the event with the smbh in the galaxy plausible .",

    "however , the lack of any further examples in the subsequent four years suggests that this is more likely a statistical fluke .",
    "it is possible to quantify this via an archival search of _ swift _ grbs and the bat transient monitor @xcite . within the 6.5 years of data reported in @xcite",

    "similar to @xcite , we can determine an implied analogous ( i.e. similar _ isotropic _ luminosity ) relativistic tdf rate based on the 3 events observed in @xmath710 years , using the volume bounded by the distance to _ swift _ j2058 + 05 , as the most distant yet observed at @xmath147 giving a comoving volume of 215 gpc@xmath148 , and assuming the local number density of @xmath113@xmath149 smbhs to be @xmath150 mpc@xmath151 @xcite . the resulting rate is found to be @xmath152 per galaxy per year , in stark contrast to the @xmath153 inferred from thermal tdf detections ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "even if a significant fraction of the ulgrb population were related to similar phenomena this would be unlikely to constitute the majority of the factor of @xmath154 required . to resolve this discrepancy likely requires a combination of tightly beamed high energy emission , such as that seen in grbs , and that not all tdfs produce relativistic jets .",

    "the second , ic3599 , may be an agn @xcite , and has recently exhibited repeated flares , either due to repeated partial disruptions of the same star on an @xmath159 year orbit @xcite or due to ongoing agn activity @xcite . because of this , the suggested 10@xmath160 jetted tdf fraction may be overestimated , which would explain the lack of detections in any of the other studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
