    "ultracold atoms in optical lattices offer the opportunity to realize a multitude of systems and to study their quantum phenomena @xcite .",
    "moreover , recent experimental advances in optical trapping allow to control the size and atom number of these quantum systems , and furthermore include the tunability of the atomic interactions via feshbach resonances @xcite .",
    "a promising research direction in this context is the non - equilibrium quantum dynamics for finite atomic ensembles . here ,",
    "the most frequently considered setting is a quantum quench ( see refs . @xcite and references therein ) , where one explores the quantum evolution after a sudden change of an intrinsic system parameter such as the interaction strength @xcite .",
    "a complicating feature of the non - equilibrium dynamics is the presence of interactions at a level that often precludes the use of a perturbative analysis and/or mean - field ( mf ) approximation .",
    "specifically , the dynamics beyond the paradigm of linear response has been a subject of growing theoretical interest @xcite triggered by the recent progress in ultracold atom experiments particularly in one spatial dimension @xcite .",
    "referring to few - body systems in finite optical lattices , it has been shown @xcite that following an interaction quench several tunneling pathways can be excited as well as collective behavior such as the cradle or breathing mode are observed .",
    "furthermore , a sudden raise of the interactions @xcite couples one of the tunneling modes with the cradle mode giving rise to a resonant behavior . on the other hand , a sudden decrease of the inter - particle repulsion @xcite excites the cradle mode only for setups with a filling larger than unity and no mode coupling can be observed . from this",
    "it is evident that in order to steer the dynamics the considered quench protocol plays a key role .",
    "naturally , one can then generalize the underlying protocol to a multiple interaction quench ( miq ) scenario , which consists of different sequences of single quenches .",
    "a specific case would be a quench followed by its inverse namely by going back to the original interaction strength ( single pulse ) .",
    "this enables the system to dynamically return to its original hamiltonian within certain time intervals and the question emerges what properties induced by the quench persist during the longer time evolution .",
    "very recently @xcite a study of the effects of the miq protocol on the one- and two - body correlation functions of a three - dimensional ultracold bose gas has been performed using the time - dependent bogoliubov approximation .",
    "it has been shown that the system produces more elementary excitations with increasing number of miqs , while the correlation functions tend to a constant value for long evolution times .",
    "in the present work , we provide a multimode treatment of few bosons in finite optical lattices in one spatial dimension , where all correlations are taken into account .",
    "such an approach is very appropriate in order to extract information on the resulting many - body dynamics and in order to obtain the complete excitation spectrum .",
    "this will allow us to explore how the miq protocol , reflected by the different temporal interaction intervals , affects the system dynamics and as a consequence the persistence of the emergent various collective modes during the evolution .",
    "several protocols varying the number of quenches are hereby investigated .",
    "our focus is on the regime of intermediate interaction strengths , where current state of the art analytical approaches are not applicable .",
    "the lowest - band tunneling dynamics involves several channels following a quench of increasing interaction , while only a few persist when the system is quenched back .",
    "furthermore , the intrawell excited motion is described by the cradle and the breathing modes being initiated by the over - barrier transport which is a consequence of the quench to increased interactions .",
    "we find that in the course of the miq the cradle mode persists for all times , while the breathing mode possesses distinct frequencies depending on the different time intervals of the miq .",
    "in contrast to the single quench scenario @xcite here by tuning the parameters of the miq we can manipulate both the interwell tunneling and the intrawell excited modes . moreover , the higher - band excitation dynamics is explored in detail .",
    "a monotonic increase of the excited to higher - band fraction for larger quench amplitudes is observed and a non - linear dependence on the time interval of a single quench ( pulse width ) is revealed .",
    "remarkably the interplay between the quench amplitude and the pulse width yields a tunability of the higher - band excitation dynamics .",
    "this observation indicates a substantial degree of controllability of the system under a miq protocol , being an important result of our work .",
    "moreover , it is shown that in the course of a certain pulse the presence of increased interactions leads to a periodic population transfer between different lattice momenta , while for the time intervals of the initial interaction strength this does not happen .",
    "the frequency of the above - mentioned periodicity possesses a power - law dependence on the quench amplitude .",

    "to include three localized single - particle wannier states in each well we employ a sufficiently large lattice depth of @xmath27 . finally , for convenience we set @xmath28 .",
    "hence , all quantities below are given in dimensionless units .    to solve the underlying many - body schrdinger equation we employ the multi - configuration time - dependent hartree method for bosons ( mctdhb ) @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the mf approximation , within this method we take all correlations into account and employ a variable number of variationally optimized time - dependent single - particle functions ( see appendix a for more details ) .",
    "below , when comparing with the mf approximation we will refer to mctdhb as the correlated approach . for the interpretation and analysis of the induced dynamics it is preferable to rely on a time - independent many - body basis rather than the time - dependent one used for our numerical calculations .",
    "we therefore project the numerically obtained wavefunction on a time - independent number state basis consisting of single - particle states localized on each lattice site .",
    "thus , the total wavefunction is expanded in terms of non - interacting multiband wannier number states .",
    "the wannier states between different wells possess a fairly small overlap for not too high energetic excitation as the employed lattice potential ( @xmath27 ) is deep enough .",

    "it is thus dominated by the number state @xmath61 . to induce the dynamics we focus on a double and five pulse quench protocol",

    "the system is only weakly perturbed since @xmath72 . for @xmath73",
    "the fidelity deviates significantly from unity and exhibits in time an oscillatory pattern .",
    "these oscillations are amplified with increasing quench amplitude and characterized both by a higher amplitude and frequency due to the increasing deposition of energy into the system . for the double pulse protocol the dynamical response",
    "is altered , as compared to the single quench scenario , and it is characterized by four distinct temporal regions , see fig .",
    "[ fid_over_g ] ( @xmath67 ) . for @xmath74",
    "the same pattern as for the single quench is , of course , observed as the two protocols are identical within this time interval , i.e. @xmath75 . at @xmath76 the system is quenched back to @xmath1 and the oscillation of the fidelity almost vanishes .",
    "then , @xmath77 where the value @xmath78 depends strongly on the phase of the oscillation at @xmath76 and therefore on @xmath79 . during the positive half of the second pulse @xmath80 an oscillatory pattern",
    "is observed , possessing the same frequencies with those occuring during the positive half of the first pulse .",
    "the system is driven further away from the initial state as more energy is added .",
    "note that the dominant frequency of the oscillation depends on @xmath79 as in the single quench scenario , see fig .",
    "[ fid_over_g ] ( @xmath66 ) . at @xmath81",
    "the system is quenched back to @xmath1 and the oscillatory behavior of the response again vanishes .",
    "hereafter , @xmath82 . remarkably enough , for @xmath83 the fidelity reduces significantly after the second pulse to the value @xmath84 at @xmath85 .",
    "the existence of such strong response regions for certain combinations of @xmath79 and @xmath0 is caused by the miq scenario and will be addressed below in more detail .    to identify the corresponding tunneling modes that participate in the dynamics we inspect the spectrum of the fidelity @xcite for the single quench [ fig .",
    "[ fid_over_g ] ( @xmath68 ) ] and the double pulse [ fig .",
    "[ fid_over_g ] ( @xmath69 ) ] protocols .",
    "both scenarios excite the same frequency modes possessing though some differences , caused by the fact that in the finite time intervals that the system is quenched back within the double pulse protocol the response remains mainly stable .",
    "the observed modes triggered by a single ( double - pulsed ) quench can be energetically categorized as follows : @xmath86 [ ( @xmath87 ) ] tunneling within the sp category , @xmath88 [ ( @xmath89 ) ] tunneling between the sp and dp categories and @xmath90 [ ( @xmath91 ) ] tunneling between the sp and t categories .",
    "the latter two processes are reminiscent of the atom pair tunneling which has been experimentally detected in driven optical lattices @xcite . to gain more insight into the spectrum of the double pulse scenario we have splitted the evolution into the different temporal regions that the protocol imposes , i.e. @xmath92 or @xmath93 . as",
    "nearly no oscillations occur in the negative halves of the double pulse ( @xmath94 and @xmath95 ) all tunneling branches except @xmath96 are then suppressed .",
    "note here that , in principle , for @xmath93 all branches possess very small and nearly equal frequencies which are resolvable in the case of a large enough @xmath0 .",
    "however , for @xmath74 ( positive half of the first pulse ) and @xmath80 ( positive half of the second pulse ) the above - mentioned three modes occur , see also fig .",
    "[ fid_over_g ] ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "the latter enables us to dynamically manipulate or even switch on and off certain tunneling processes due to the presence or absence of increased interactions .",
    "finally , we remark that the branches denoted e.g. by @xmath97 , @xmath98 refer to higher - band excitations and will be addressed below .",
    "let us focus on the cradle and the breathing mode in the following .",
    "the cradle mode represents a dipole - like intrawell oscillation induced by an over - barrier transport following the interaction quench @xcite .",
    "it breaks the parity symmetry within the outer wells and can thus be quantified by the corresponding intrawell asymmetry of the wavefunction .",
    "for instance , in the left well @xmath99 , where @xmath100 and @xmath101 denote the spatially integrated densities of the left and the right half of the well . to investigate the frequencies that characterize the cradle mode and how they are influenced by the different quench protocols we employ the spectrum @xmath102 .",
    "previously @xcite it has been shown that following a single interaction quench @xmath103 , as a function of the quench amplitude , possesses mainly two distinct frequency branches [ see fig .",
    "[ crad_breath_a ] ( @xmath66 ) ] .",
    "the latter , refer to a tunneling mode @xmath104 [ see branch @xmath105 in fig .",

    "remarkably , these two modes come into resonance in a certain region of quench amplitudes [ see the dashed rectangle in fig .",
    "[ crad_breath_a ] ( @xmath66 ) ] , and therefore it is possible to couple the interwell ( tunneling ) with the intrawell ( cradle ) dynamics . however following a double pulse ,",
    "[ crad_breath_a](@xmath67 ) , the aforementioned resonance is hardly visible as the tunneling mode is less pronounced compared to the single quench scenario [ compare also figs [ fid_over_g ] ( @xmath68 ) , ( @xmath69 ) ] .",
    "indeed , the tunneling mode [ see branch @xmath108 in fig . [ crad_breath_a ] ( @xmath67 ) ] is present only when @xmath109 , while the cradle mode [ see branch @xmath110 in fig .",
    "[ crad_breath_a ] ( @xmath67 ) ] persists also after we quench back to @xmath1 .",
    "the above can be explained as follows : when the interaction strength is reduced , the bosons do not possess the required energy to perform a second order tunneling process , and therefore the sp to t tunneling mode , see @xmath111 , is absent when we quench back . on the contrary",
    ", the cradle mode persists also when @xmath112 , @xmath113 as it is an intrawell mode and has already been initialized previously .",
    "therefore , a tunneling process is required to initialize the cradle mode but is not a prerequisite for it to persist . as a consequence the coupling between the cradle mode and the sp to t tunneling mode disappears when @xmath93 and occurs only for @xmath92 .",
    "thus , using a miq protocol one can switch on and off the above described mode resonance [ see also the dashed rectangle in fig .",
    "[ crad_breath_a ] ( @xmath67 ) ] .",

    "the fact that the breathing mode is also visible in the intrawell asymmetry spectrum [ see fig .",
    "[ crad_breath_a ] ( @xmath66 ) ] of the left ( right ) well is another indication that it is indeed a global mode .",
    "the lower branch ( denoted as @xmath125 ) corresponds to the interwell tunneling mode @xmath126 .",
    "both of the above branches weakly depend on the quench amplitude @xmath79 .",
    "turning to the double pulse , [ fig .",
    "[ crad_breath_a ] ( @xmath69 ) ] the above two branches now indicated by @xmath127 and @xmath128 persist but also two additional and @xmath19-independent branches marked by @xmath129 and @xmath130 appear above @xmath128 .",
    "note here that @xmath131 showing that these branches stem from the same eigenfrequencies , while the branch @xmath132 refers to an admixture of higher - band states .",
    "importantly , the @xmath19-independent branches exist only during the time intervals of @xmath1 i.e. for @xmath94 and @xmath95 , whereas the @xmath19-dependence occurs only during the positive halves of the miq i.e. for @xmath92 .",
    "to conclude , the double pulse miq protocol gives rise to two additional @xmath19-independent branches of breathing dynamics .",
    "the latter suggests that by tuning the intrinsic parameters of the miq protocol one can steer the induced breathing dynamics .      to gain a deeper understanding of the excitation dynamics , we investigate in the following the occupation of higher - band states during the time evolution .",

    "for instance , using different pulse widths we can switch on and off for chosen time intervals certain tunneling modes of the system .",
    "we then turned to the excited modes , i.e. the cradle and the breathing modes .",
    "the cradle mode ignores the multipulse nature of the quench protocol and persists during the time evolution",
    ". however , the breathing mode shows a strong dependence on the instantaneous interatomic repulsion .",
    "indeed , within the positive halves of the miq it possesses an interaction dependent frequency branch .",
    "however , in the negative halves of the miq the latter branch disappears and two new frequency branches appear which are interaction independent . as a result the system turns from the @xmath79-dependent to the @xmath79-independent branch providing further controllability .",
    "furthermore , the excitation dynamics is investigated in detail . to analyze the dependence on the quench amplitude we focus on a fixed pulse width and vary the final interaction strength .",
    "it is shown that the excitation dynamics possesses a linear dependence on the quench amplitude , i.e. for increasing amplitude of the quench the amount of excitations as seen in the fidelity increase .",
    "for the dependence of the excitation dynamics on the pulse width we observe a non - linear dependence , i.e. there is no monotonic behavior of the produced excitations with varying pulse width .",
    "the latter implies that in order to control the excitation dynamics one has to use an optimal combination of the quench amplitude and the pulse width .",
    "another prominent signature of the impact of the quenches is revealed by inspecting the momentum distribution . a periodic population transfer of lattice momenta within the positive halves of the miq protocol and a transition to a side peak structure in the negative halves of the miq are observed .",
    "this periodic population transfer of lattice momenta constitutes an independent signature of the excited energy channels within the positive halves of the miq protocol , allowing to study it from another perspective and to potentially measure it in corresponding experiments .",

    "should be trapped in a one - dimensional optical superlattice being formed by two retroreflected laser beams . to form each supercell of the superlattice the first beam possesses a large wavenumber and intensity when compared to the second beam which forms each cell of the supercell .",
    "the above mentioned wavenumbers should be commensurate .",
    "then , the potential landscape of each supercell is similar to the one considered in the present study .",
    "such an experimental implementation may be achieved either by the use of holographic masks @xcite or by the modulation of the wavenumber @xcite .",
    "the interatomic repulsion can be tuned with the aid of a magnetic feshbach resonance .",
    "the corresponding dynamical properties can then be probed with the recently developed single - site resolved imaging techniques ( quantum microscope ) @xcite .",
    "we also remark that double occupancies can also be identified via feshbach molecule formation @xcite , while triple occupancies can be measured by inducing three - body recombination @xcite .",
    "finally , we provide an outlook onto possible future investigations .",
    "the achieved understanding of the non - equilibrium dynamics induced by multiple pulses of the interatomic repulsion may inspire similar investigations in other more complicated systems .",
    "a possible direction would be to apply our protocol to repulsively interacting dipolar systems and/or to include modulations of the lattice geometry .",
    "certainly for larger particle numbers and sizes the question whether thermalization @xcite occurs for long evolution times after the system has been quenched to its initial hamiltonian is an intriguing one .",
    "to solve the time - dependent many - body schrdinger equation @xmath229 we apply the multi - configuration time - dependent hartree method for bosons @xcite ( mctdhb ) .",
    "this method has been used extensively in the literature to explore the bosonic quantum dynamics , see for instance @xcite .",
    "the key idea of mctdhb is to exploit time - dependently variationally optimized single - particle functions ( spfs ) to form many - body states and thus to achieve an optimal truncation of the hilbert space .",
    "the ansatz for the many - body wavefunction is taken as a linear combination of time - dependent permanents @xmath230 with time - dependent weights @xmath231 . each time - dependent permanent @xmath232 corresponds to a certain configuration of bosons that occupy @xmath5 variationally optimized ( see above ) spfs @xmath233 . in turn , the spfs are expanded using a primitive time - independent basis @xmath234 of dimension @xmath235 .",

    "this exponentially damps out all contributions but the one stemming from the ground state like @xmath243 and therefore the system relaxes to the ground state ( within the prescribed accuracy ) after a finite time .",
    "to study the dynamics , we propagate the wavefunction by utilizing the appropriate hamiltonian within the mctdhb equations of motion .",
