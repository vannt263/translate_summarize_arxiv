    "in the study of high - temperature superconductivity in the cuprates , there has been intense interest in the interplay between antiferromagnetism and superconductivity .",
    "the undoped parent compound , which is a mott insulator , is an antiferromagnetic ( af ) long - range ordered state . upon carrier doping , the af state is converted into the high - temperature superconducting ( sc ) state . in the mechanism of superconductivity ,",
    "the af correlation is believed to play an important role . in order to investigate the af correlation effect on superconductivity , multilayer systems are useful . in multilayer systems ,",
    "the number of cuo@xmath0 layers per unit cell , @xmath1 , takes @xmath2 . from systematic studies of the @xmath1 dependence of sc transition temperature @xmath3",
    ", it is found that the maximum @xmath3 is obtained @xcite for the case of @xmath4 . since coupling between the cuo@xmath0 planes within the unit cell is stronger than that between the cuo@xmath0 planes in different unit cells , the af correlation can be strong in multilayer systems .",
    "there is also charge imbalance over the cuo@xmath0 layers as revealed by the @xmath5cu knight shifts , and thus the multilayer systems form a natural heterostructure at an intermediate carrier - concentration region.@xcite from nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) experiments it was suggested that af moments survived even in a sc phase.@xcite a possibility of a phase separation is ruled out because the nmr signal associated with the paramagnetic state was not observed.@xcite an important issue here is whether sc order coexists with af order  @xcite or not .",
    "recently , shimizu _ et",
    "al_. studied the temperature dependence of the af moment in a five - layered cuprate ba@xmath0ca@xmath6cu@xmath7o@xmath8(f , o)@xmath0 by nmr measurements.@xcite they reported that the af moment in the outer layer is enhanced below @xmath3 .",
    "such an enhancement of the af moment below @xmath3 does not appear in the coexistence phase of other superconductors such as iron arsenide superconductor ba@xmath0(fe@xmath9co@xmath10)@xmath0as@xmath0 , where the af moment reduces at @xmath3.@xcite therefore , the enhancement seen in the five - layered cuprate is not necessarily common to all of the coexistence phase of superconductors .",
    "noting that the iron arsenide is a single - layer system , we may speculate that the multilayer nature is essential for the enhancement , and thus need to clarify the mechanism of the af moment enhancement triggered by the sc transition under the presence of multilayers .    in this paper",
    ", we study the interplay between sc and af orders within a mean field theory . to describe a multilayer system , where there are two types of layers associated with outer planes and inner planes , we consider a bilayer system with different electronic correlations in each layer . by controlling interaction parameters for the af correlation and the sc correlation",
    ", we study the proximity effect between two layers with different order and also examine the possibility of coexistence of sc and af orders .",
    "we find that the proximity effect leads to an enhancement of af order below the sc transition temperature that is consistent with the experiment.@xcite by contrast , we find qualitatively different behaviors of the order parameters for the coexistence case .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.[sec_model ] , we introduce the bilayer hamiltonian and describe the mean field theory . in our model , a coexistence phase of sc and af orders is possible within a single layer .",
    "this coexistence phase is described in sec.[sec_single ] . in sec.[sec_bilayer ] , we describe the results about the proximity effect in the bilayer system .",
    "we show that the temperature dependence of the af moment is consistent with the experiment.@xcite we also examine coexistence phases and show that the temperature dependence of the order parameters is quite different from the experiment . finally , sec.[sec_summary ]",
    "is devoted to summary and discussions .",
    "we consider a bilayer system with interactions which stabilize sc and/or af order .",
    "the two layers are coupled through an interlayer tunneling .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath11 where the interlayer tunneling term @xmath12 is @xmath13 here @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) creates ( annihilates ) electrons with in - plane momentum @xmath16 and spin @xmath17 at layer @xmath18 .",
    "we assume that the interlayer hopping matrix @xmath19 is independent of @xmath16 .",
    "the hamiltonian for the @xmath18 layer is @xmath20 with @xmath21 .",
    "( hereafter we set the lattice constant to unity . ) the hopping of electrons within each layer is restricted to the nearest neighbors given by @xmath22 .",
    "energies are measured in units of @xmath22 in the following analysis .",
    "we focus on the half - filing case in each layer so that we set the chemical potential @xmath23 .",
    "this means that we neglect charge redistribution between the two layers .",
    "the second term of @xmath24 describes the af interaction .",

    "the third term of @xmath24 with @xmath28 describes the interaction for @xmath29-wave pairing .",
    "we define the @xmath30-wave sc order parameter in the @xmath18 layer with @xmath31 sites by @xmath32 with @xmath33 the af order parameter in the @xmath18 layer is defined by @xmath34 where the summation with respect to @xmath16 is taken over the reduced brillouin zone @xmath35 and the nesting vector is @xmath36 . by using the order parameters ,",

    ", the coexistence phase of sc and af orders can be stabilized.@xcite the situation is similar to the slave - boson mean field theory of the @xmath22-@xmath45 model  @xcite and the hubbard model in the strong - coupling limit.@xcite    figure [ fig_single](a ) shows the parameter range of @xmath46 for the coexistence phase at @xmath47 . for @xmath48",
    "the system is a pure af state while for @xmath49 the system is a pure sc state.@xcite so the coexistence phase appears for @xmath50 . for the case of @xmath51 , the parameter for the coexistence changes as @xmath52 . in order to confirm that the state with @xmath53 and @xmath54 is the global minimum of the free energy , we computed the following energy at @xmath55 for @xmath56 and @xmath57 : @xmath58 where @xmath59 runs over the all eigenstates of the mean field hamiltonian and @xmath60 are the eigenenergies .",
    "we examined several cases and confirmed that the coexistence phase solution corresponds to the global minimum of the energy .",
    "we examined the @xmath61-wave case as well , but there is no coexistence phase .",
    "there are two types of coexistence phases .",
    "one is the phase with strong af order and weak sc order , resulting in the af transition temperature @xmath62 , and the other is the phase with @xmath63 .",
    "figure  [ fig_single](b ) shows the temperature dependence of the order parameters in the coexistence phase with @xmath62 at @xmath64 and @xmath65 . for comparison ,",
    "the pure af case at @xmath66 and @xmath65 and the pure sc case at @xmath64 and @xmath67 are also shown . for this choice of the parameters",

    "therefore , the system first exhibits af order upon decreasing temperature .",
    "@xmath3 is somewhat reduced because of the presence of af order .",
    "the occurrence of the sc order also affects the af order : the temperature dependence of @xmath69 in fig .",
    "[ fig_single](b ) deviates from the pure af case at @xmath3 , resulting in the reduction of @xmath69 .",

    "our purpose is twofold .",

    ", we see that the values of the order parameters are not so much affected by the increase of @xmath19 .",
    "this weak @xmath19 regime is not suitable for describing multilayer systems because each layer is almost independent .",
    "in fact , the change of @xmath71 and @xmath72 in the weak @xmath19 regime is described by the second - order perturbation theory with respect to @xmath19 . at @xmath77 , there is a first order transition between the weak @xmath19 regime and the strong @xmath19 regime as shown in fig .",

    "the three cases are ( i ) @xmath88 , ( ii ) @xmath89 , and ( iii ) @xmath90 .",

    "these temperature dependences are qualitatively different from the experimentally observed one . from this observation",
    "one may conclude that it is unlikely that there is a coexistence phase of intrinsic sc and af orders in a layer among coupled multilayers .",
    "although the coexistence phase of af and sc orders appears in all cases ( i)-(iii ) , the origin of af order in the sc layer is different .",
    "what makes the difference between the case ( iii ) and the case ( ii ) is that in the case ( iii ) af order in the @xmath85 layer with sc is intrinsic order but not induced by the other layer .",

    "the value of @xmath71 is enhanced below the sc transition .",
    "this discrepancy is probably associated with the change of the fermi surface shape .",
    "to summarize , we have studied the proximity effect and the possibility of coexistence of af and sc orders in a bilayer system .",
    "our mean field theory suggests that the experimentally observed enhancement of af order below @xmath3  @xcite is associated with the proximity effect .",
