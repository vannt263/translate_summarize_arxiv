    "population models , or reaction - diffusion systems have attracted enormous interest both in the statistical physics community and as abstract versions of real biological dynamics .",
    "one particular aspect is the presence of phase transitions and the contact process or directed percolation in various disguises ( see below , @xcite ) .",
    "host  parasite or predator  prey systems are a natural extension of single species models . by their classical results",
    "lotka and volterra were able to explain the nature of abundance oscillations in interacting species @xcite .",
    "in regular landscapes or lattices , with a finite spreading rate of the species , these oscillations appear as traveling waves , which can be regular or chaotic , depending on the interplay of time scales in population dynamics and spreading , though it is not clear if the phenomenon survives in the thermodynamic limit @xcite . in nature",
    "they have been observed in different systems , to name two extreme cases , e.g.  in vole populations @xcite and for human diseases such as measles @xcite . in the case of measles in a population living on a landscape of nontrivial island structure , power law fluctuations are found instead @xcite .",
    "much of these ideas have recently been generalized in the context of small - world or in particular `` scale - free '' graphs @xcite . for the latter ,",
    "a perfectly valid example is given by epidemics of viruses in the internet since it has as a graph a fat - tailed probability distribution of the number of nearest neighbors , @xmath0 .",
    "recently , various models have been studied as the particulars of the structure  as the so - called degree distribution gamma in @xmath1  are varied .",
    "a fundamental discovery concerning disease spreading is an absence of epidemic threshold in the limit of infinite graphs and the finite - size effective `` critical point '' obeys an unusual scaling as @xmath2 , the graph size , is varied @xcite .",
    "this closely relates to the present work where we study the influence of a network or graph like structure of the underlying landscape on host  parasite or predator  prey dynamics .",
    "the main findings are ( i ) the absence of oscillations , ( ii ) the absence of an infection threshold in the limit of an infinite scale free graph , and ( iii ) the existence of two _ separate _ transitions in the case of bethe lattices with finite coordination number @xmath3 ( `` empty '' @xmath4 `` hosts only '' , `` hosts only '' @xmath4 `` hosts plus parasites '' , but _ no _ transition `` empty '' @xmath4 `` hosts plus parasites '' ) .",
    "the structure of the rest of the paper is as follows : section ii contains the necessary definitions , and the two following ones analytical considerations and , to compare , numerical simulations of the models .",
    "finally , section v finishes the paper with a discussion .",
    "a basic model for epidemiological applications is the _ contact process _ , or the so - called _ sis _ model .",
    "here one considers individuals living on the nodes of an underlying graph which are either infected ( @xmath5 ) or susceptible ( @xmath6 ) to an infection . an infected individual may spread the disease to a susceptible one if both are in contact , i.e.  if they live on neighboring nodes of the graph .",
    "infected individuals recover with a certain rate and in this simple version immediately become susceptible for a new infection .",
    "so the dynamics of the _ sis _ model is defined by the rates @xmath7    in this work we generalize the _ sis _ model to a system with hosts and parasites ( _ hp _ ) . in other words",
    "we consider infections of a second kind only able to spread onto sites with infections of first kind .",
    "so each node in the graph can be in three possible states : empty ( @xmath8 ) , populated by a healthy host ( @xmath9 ) , or by a host with parasite ( @xmath10 ) . between three states",
    "there are six possible transitions so the dynamics are defined by the following rates @xmath11 as in the _ sis _ model defined above the decay of the host or first kind infection sets the time scale ( @xmath12 ) . in biological systems",
    "@xmath13 ( even @xmath14 ) if the parasite affects the health of the host",
    ". a benefit would mean @xmath15 .",
    "we shall consider cases in which the parasite virtually does not die `` on its own '' but only when the host is killed , i.e.  the case @xmath16 .",
    "[ rates ]    in section [ mfd ] we present approximate analytical solutions following @xcite to the the model of eqs .",
    "( [ hpmodel ] ) which are compared to monte carlo simulations in section [ mc ] .",
    "particular interest lies in parasite extinction and its dependence on the parasite spreading rate @xmath17 .",
    "but first we define the types of graphs used in our simulations and calculations .",
    "we study the population dynamics of the hp  model on two types of graphs , on bethe lattices and on scale free barabsi ",

    "when constructing a finite lattice , or cayley tree , starting from a central node with @xmath3 neighbors and adding @xmath18 new neighbors to each boundary node , the number of boundary nodes grows exponentially .",
    "it therefore remains a finite fraction of the total number of nodes in the finite tree , which makes this construction unsuitable for monte carlo simulations .",
    "this difficulty can be overcome by a slight modification @xcite where a sparse homogeneous graph that closely approximates the bethe lattice without any boundary nodes is constructed .",
    "take @xmath2 nodes and label them by integers from 1 to @xmath2 .",
    "connect node @xmath19 to node @xmath20 for each @xmath19 and connect node 1 to node @xmath2 .",
    "construct @xmath21 independent random pairings of the nodes ( an easy way to construct pairings is to sort the nodes randomly and pair the first node of this new order with the second one etc . ) of the nodes and add an edge for each pair . by this procedure",
    ", we get a graph in which each node is of degree @xmath3 . for large enough graphs ,",
    "the loops are negligible @xcite and this is a sufficient approximation of a bethe lattice .    here",
    ", we also use the standard version of barabsi - albert graphs ( ba - graphs ) @xcite .",
    "these are constructed as usual .",
    "new nodes are added one by one connecting them with @xmath22 links to the previous ones . from these",
    ", the neighbors are chosen with a probability proportional to their respective number of links ( preferential attachment ) . by this construction",
    "highly linked nodes are likely to obtain even more neighbors as the graph grows , which results in a `` fat tail '' distribution of probabilities for a node to have coordination number @xmath23 , @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "the ba - graphs have very weak degree correlations , i.e. the conditional probability for a node of degree @xmath23 to have a neighbor with @xmath25 is rather trivial @xcite compared to many other models and real networks .",
    "in this subsection we extend the known solution for the sis model on a bethe lattice @xcite to the hp model . @xmath26 and @xmath27 denote the density of hosts and parasites , respectively . for simplicity",
    "we consider the limit @xmath28 , so parasitized patches do not supply host individuals to neighboring empty patches .",
    "the rate equations for the densities can be written as @xmath29 with @xmath30 and @xmath31 .    in the absence of parasites",
    "the host population follows the dynamics of a sis model .",
    "the trivial state @xmath32 is stable for @xmath33 and unstable otherwise . in other words ,",
    "the host population can survive only for @xmath34 .",
    "similarly , the pure host phase is stable if parasites can not invade , i.e. , if the growth rate of a small parasite population is smaller than its death rate , @xmath35 from this formula it can be seen that @xmath36 as @xmath37 , so there is no `` tricritical point '' in the phase plane , beyond which a direct transition from the absorbed state to the coexistence state can be seen . the phase diagram is drawn in fig .",
    "[ fig : bethe - lattice - phasediagram ] .",
    "the singlet approach neglects occupancy correlations between adjacent nodes .",
    "the next logical step is a pair or doublet approximation which explicitly treats the joint probabilities to find two unparasitized hosts next to each other ( @xmath38 ) , a healthy host next to a parasitized one ( @xmath39 ) , and two parasitized next to each other ( @xmath40 ) in addition to @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",

    "this , in turn , tells that the dynamics of the parasites is similar to the dynamics of the hosts in the sis model ( since in the sis model the number of edges that can spread the population is proportional to the population density in the steady - state ) and serves as an explanation to the zero threshold of the parasites .",
    "for a numerical comparison we have simulated the host - parasite - model in barabsi - albert networks of sizes @xmath162 under the conditions in which @xmath163 and @xmath164 , i.e.  with a stable hosts population and parasites close to extinction .",
    "the simulations are always started with random initial conditions by giving @xmath165 of the nodes the status @xmath166 and @xmath167 of the nodes the status @xmath168 independently .",
    "then the simulation is run for a given saturation period of @xmath169 mc - steps during which even the largest system reaches a stationary state .",

    "this procedure was repeated @xmath176 times for different realizations of the graphs with @xmath176 varying from @xmath177 for @xmath178 to @xmath179 for @xmath180 .",

    "for instance when @xmath178 one may estimate that @xmath182 .",
    "the inset in the figure [ fig : rho_vs_p ] strongly suggests that the relationship @xmath183 is established as in the sis model @xcite .    .",

    "[ fig : pc ] shows a scaling @xmath189 in the region @xmath190 , which again compares to the finite size scaling of the critical threshold in the sis model @xcite .     as for the sis model @xcite.,width=302 ]    since the probability for a node to become infected depends on its degree we next take a look at the parasite prevalence of nodes of degree @xmath23 @xmath106 in fig .",
    "[ fig : rhok ] and the average degree of a site occupied by a parasite @xmath191 in fig .",

    "the straight line in the inset is a guide to the eye.,width=302 ]    fig .",
    "[ fig : rhok ] shows that when approaching @xmath186 the relationship @xmath194 begins to hold better and better whereas @xmath105 does not change remarkably since the host population is large .",
    "in fact , we have noted that , in analogy with the sis - model , the scaling of @xmath106 is not just a matter of coincidence but reflects the more general presence of the factor @xmath195 which is proportional to @xmath23 at small @xmath96 , or for large values of the constant .",
    "generally , this behavior implies that the largest connected component of hosts serves as a `` scalefree '' graph for the parasites thus partly explaining the absence of a critical point in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "as @xmath196 , survival of the parasite population becomes more and more difficult .",
    "[ fig : ek ] shows a consequence of this : the parasites do not prefer living in nodes of small degree anymore but , instead , the average degree of the nodes inhabited by them increases .",
    "in fact , as the inset of fig .  [",
    "fig : ek ] shows , the scaling @xmath197 is established .",
    "a similar result should actually also hold for the sis - model , and is predicted even by the mean - field equations ( [ eq : rate_scalefree_singlet_hosts ] ) and ( [ eq : rate_scalefree_singlet_parasites ] ) .",
    "this in turn follows from the fact that for a decreasing @xmath198 the parasite density begins to saturate only at a higher and higher @xmath23 ( recall that it is linear in @xmath23 for small degrees ) .",
    "we have also considered the autocorrelations of the time - series of the parasite prevalence , in analogy to ref .",
    "this decays exponentially with a time - scale constant that increases as the ( pseudo)critical point ( for @xmath2 fixed ) is approached from above .",
    "in this paper we have studied a two - population model ( `` hosts '' and `` parasites '' ) .",
    "first , as a preliminary , this problem was considered on the bethe lattice .",
    "it turns out that the mean - field treatment can be augmented with the pair approximation .",
    "in particular we have been able to establish the generic form of phase diagram depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : bethe - lattice - phasediagram ] .",
    "this includes no tricritical point .",
    "the main finding of this work concerns the epidemic threshold of the parasites , in the presence of a non - zero host population , on scale - free graphs .",
    "analytical arguments based on the neighbor  pair probabilities reveal that in full analogy with the sis model itself , the threshold is zero in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "numerical simulations on barabsi  albert model graphs imply that the finite - size behavior follows , also , the same scaling , and confirm this picture . these both findings might be surprising at first sight , due to the possible complications from correlations .",
    "concomitantly , correlations in the parasite dynamics are expected to follow the same picture as in the case of the sis model .",
    "a striking feature related to correlated activity is the `` escape '' of the parasite population to vertices with , on the average , a high degree , which can actually be explained within the standard picture of ( sis - type ) population behavior as the prevalence is reduced by changing a control parameter . due to the non - regular nature of the scale - free graphs we have not seen any indications of e.g.  periodic , or chaotic oscillations that arise in many similar models on regular lattices @xcite .",
    "another possible angle would be to study contact process  like models @xcite , where the spreading rate out of a graph vertex to a neighbor would depend on the degree of the out - vertex , for both parasites and hosts .",
    "the phase diagram of such model would be the same for the bethe case , but for scale - free network one would , in analogy for the contact process itself @xcite , expect a _ finite threshold _ instead of the vanishing one for the sis model .",
    "we have confirmed this , analytically , but obviously numerical studies would be of interest .",
    "the results have implications , less for bethe lattices which serve as an analytically tractable special case , but possibly for dynamical processes on real scale - free graphs .",
    "examples can be found from ecology ( metapopulation dynamics ) , where similar multi - species scenarios have already been studied .",
    "parasitoids do play a crucial role for the population dynamics of the endangered butterfly species _ melitaea cinxia _ in its fragmented habitat on the land islands in the baltic sea , which fit less well to single species models @xcite .",
    "due to the distribution of patch sizes and distances between them , the corresponding network model has a large tail degree distribution @xcite .",
    "whether a given patch is populated by hosts only or also by parasitoids depends on its local connectedness .",
    "at least qualitatively the observations agree with those in fig .",
    "[ fig : ek ] and more systematic studies can be envisioned .",
    "the spreading rate depends on distance between and sizes of patches , in a nontrivial way @xcite .",
    "if one translates the underlying landscape to a network model , the resulting spreading rates may depend strongly or weakly on the degree of the emitting node , i.e.  lie somewhere in the range between a generalized contact process and sis  type models .",
    "thus the limit considered by @xcite may well be relevant in certain ecological systems .",
    "another field of examples is epidemiology and vaccination strategies .",
    "knowledge on non  trivial network structures in disease transmission can be used for vaccination ( see e.g.  @xcite ) or outbreak prediction , e.g.  @xcite , and also the importance of superinfections has been documented ( see e.g.  a seminal work in an evolutionary context @xcite ) . our ansatz is an attempt to combine both points of view . from the scale - free network viewpoint the fundamental idea of concentrating the effort on nodes with a high @xmath23 is valid here as well @xcite ; consider in particular the `` escape '' of parasites close to extinction mentioned above . to fight parasites",
    "one needs , as well , to avoid random immunization . in this context",
    "another paradigmatic model is the `` susceptible - infected - removed '' ( sir ) model which is a variant of ordinary percolation . by taking in the hp model the right combination of limits for the parameters ( essentially , disallowing recovery to the empty state from the h and p states )",
    ", one obtains a variant of the sir which resembles in such language `` bootstrap percolation '' since the `` r '' ( `` p '' ) sites are created only via contact with a neighbor in `` r '' .",
    "one should thus take note of possible generalizations of the hp model using similar recipes as can be applied to the sir - style ones @xcite .",
    "in the case of the sis model , the cross - over ( or the time - dependent picture ) to the steady - state turns out to be interesting , which might be worth looking at here as well @xcite .",
    "another practical case related to this might be , say , viruses spreading as attachments to emails on the internet @xcite , where again one is confronted with a dynamical graph ( of email connections ) on top of a larger one ( internet ) .",
    "finally , we would like to point out that our work could be extended to other similar multi - species models .",
    "an example would be a hierarchy of contact processes ( @xmath199 , @xmath200 ) @xcite . +",
