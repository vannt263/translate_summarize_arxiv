    "the method of continuum discretized coupled channels ( cdcc ) has been successful in describing nuclear reactions including weakly bound projectiles  .",
    "cdcc has been attracting much attention since the advent of experiments with radioactive beams , because projectile breakup processes are essential to many of such reactions .",
    "cdcc plays an important role in the spectroscopic studies of radioactive nuclei through the nuclear reactions involving such nuclei .    in cdcc for reactions with a projectile consisting of two fragments ,",
    "the states of the projectile are classified by the linear and the angular momenta , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , of relative motion of the two fragments of the projectile , which are truncated by @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the truncation is the most basic assumption in cdcc , and it is confirmed that calculated @xmath8-matrix elements converge for sufficiently large @xmath9 and @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that cdcc is the first - order approximation to the distorted faddeev equations , and corrections to the converged cdcc solution are negligible within the region of space in which the reaction takes place  @xcite .    as a consequence of the truncation ,",
    "the integral equation form of the equations of coupled channels , derived from the three - body schrdinger equation , has a compact kernel , satisfying a necessary condition for iterative solutions  @xcite . in practice , however , the coupled channels equations thus obtained are impossible to be solved because of the continuously infinite number of coupled breakup channels . the problem is solved by discretizing the @xmath4 continuum .",
    "the discretization leads the coupled equations to a set of differential equations with a finite number of channels .    as for the discretization ,",
    "three methods have been proposed so far : the average ( av )  @xcite , the midpoint ( mid )  @xcite , and the pseudo - state ( ps )  @xcite methods . in the av and mid methods , the @xmath4-continuum",
    "is divided into a finite number of bins . in the former the continuum channels within each bin",
    "are averaged into a single channel , while in the latter they are represented by the channel at a midpoint of the bin .",
    "it has been confirmed that calculated @xmath8-matrix elements converge as the width @xmath11 of the bins is decreased , and also that the two methods yield the same converged @xmath8-matrix elements  @xcite . from practical point of view , the av method is more convenient than the mid one , since the former requires less numerical works than the latter .",
    "the av method therefore is most widely used in practice .    in the ps method ,",
    "the breakup states are described by superpositions of @xmath12-type basis functions .",
    "the wave functions of such pseudo breakup state have wrong asymptotic forms . for this reason ,",
    "the ps method was mainly used in the past to describe virtual breakup processes in the intermediate stage of elastic scattering and ( @xmath13 ) reactions .",
    "very recently , the applicability of the ps method for real breakup reactions for a specific set of basis functions .",
    "it was shown that the ps method well simulates the angular distribution of the total breakup cross section calculated with the av method  @xcite . in the analysis ,",
    "discrete breakup cross sections calculated with the ps method are transformed into continuous one , by assuming a specific form for the @xmath4 distribution of the continuous cross section , that is , a histogram with widths estimated in a reasonable way .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to propose a new ps method for projectile breakup reactions .",
    "if the basis functions form in the good approximation a complete set in the configuration space which is important for breakup processes , we can formulate a method of interpolation for generating continuous breakup @xmath8-matrix elements from the discrete ones provided by the ps method , following the formulation of @xcite for the av method in which the completeness of discretized states is well satisfied if the discretization is enough precise .",
    "the method does not assume any form a priori for @xmath4 distributions of continuous breakup @xmath8-matrix elements .",
    "the method is independent of the type of the basis functions used for the ps method .",
    "only condition is that the basis functions constitute an approximate complete set in the wide range of @xmath4 and its conjugate coordinate @xmath14 which are important for the breakup processes . as basis functions satisfying this condition , we propose two types of them .",
    "one is ordinary gaussian functions  @xcite , which we refer to as _ real - range gaussian function _ in the present paper .",
    "the other is a natural extension of that , _ complex - range gaussian function _",
    "@xcite , i.e , gaussian functions with the complex range parameters the precise definition of which is given in a later section .",
    "in section ii , we recapitulate cdcc based on both the av and the ps methods of discretization . in section iii",
    ", we present a method of interpolation to get continuous breakup @xmath8-matrix elements from discrete ones calculated with the ps method , and introduce the real and the complex - range gaussian basis . in section iv , the validity of the present ps method is tested and justified for two realistic cases , @xmath0+@xmath1ni scattering at 80 mev and @xmath2li+@xmath3ca scattering at 156 mev . in section v , the potentiality of the present ps method for four - body breakup reactions is discussed .",
    "section vi gives a summary .",

    "among the three methods of discretization of the @xmath4 continuum , the relation between the average ( av ) and the midpoint ( mid ) methods has already been clarified  @xcite .",
    "the present discussion therefore is focused on the relation between the av and the pseudo - state ( ps ) methods .      in the av method , the @xmath4-continuum [ 0 , @xmath9 ] , for each @xmath5",

    ", one can obtain an approximate total wave function @xmath175 by solving cdcc equations ( [ eqs : cdcc ] ) . inserting @xmath175 into the exact form of breakup @xmath91-matrix elements in place of the exact total wave function , one reaches an approximate form : @xmath176 where @xmath177 is the sum of all interactions in the four - body system ( a+b+c+x ) , @xmath18 and @xmath178 are and @xmath179 and @xmath180 are , respectively , two jacobi coordinates of the three - body ( b+c+x ) system and momenta conjugate to them .",
    "the accuracy of eq .",
    "( [ t4 ] ) depends on how complete the set @xmath181 is within the region @xmath182 which is important for the breakup process considered .",
    "an important advantage of the use of the real- and complex - range gaussian bases is , as mentioned before , that analytic integrations over @xmath18 and @xmath178 can be done in eq .",
    "( [ t4 ] ) , by expanding @xmath183 in terms of a finite number of gaussian basis functions .",
    "this makes the derivation of @xmath184 feasible .",
    "analyses based on this formulation are of much interest as a future work .",
    "the method of continuum discretized coupled channels ( cdcc ) is an accurate method of treating three - body breakup processes , in which the discretization of the @xmath4 continuum is essential . in this paper",
    ", we propose the new method of pseudo - state ( ps ) discretization which can be used not only for virtual breakup processes in elastic scattering but also for breakup reactions .",
    "first we show that an accurate transformation from the discrete breakup s - matrix elements calculated with the ps method to continuous ones is possible , since the ps basis functions can form in the good approximation a complete set in the finite region of @xmath18 and @xmath179 which is important for the breakup processes . as bases satisfying the completeness",
    ", we propose the real- and complex - range gaussian bases .",
    "both bases can treat virtual breakup processes in the elastic scattering with high accuracy , i.e. , with the error of calculated cross sections less than 1% . for breakup processes ,",
    "the complex - range gaussian basis is accurate throughout the entire region of the @xmath4 continuum .",
    "the real - range gaussian basis also keeps a good accuracy for the dominant part of breakup @xmath8-matrix elements with the lower @xmath4 , although it is partially inaccurate for the higher @xmath4 region .",
    "thus , both bases can be used for realistic analyses of elastic scattering and projectile breakup reactions .",
    "the present new ps method has at least two advantages over the widely used momentum bin average method .",
    "one is that it does not need the exact wave function of the projectile over the entire region of @xmath14 .",
    "this is important from a theoretical point of view .",
    "the other advantage is that with the real- and complex - range gaussian bases one can calculate all the coupling potentials semi - analytically , which is very useful in actual calculations .",
    "furthermore , if the projectile has resonances in its excitation spectrum , the new method discretizes the complicated spectrum with a reasonable number of the basis functions , without distinguishing the resonance states from non - resonant continuous states .",
    "these advantages of the new method are extremely helpful , sometimes even essential , in applying cdcc to four - body breakup effects of unstable nuclei such as @xmath152he and @xmath185li .",
    "actually , a cdcc analysis of four - body breakup effect on the @xmath152he elastic scattering is in progress , and the result of the analysis will appear in a forthcoming paper .",
