    "the study of low frequency modes often provides a convenient and non destructive tool to explore the properties of systems of trapped particles . for instance , the measurement of the breathing mode and the center - of - mass ( c.o.m . )",
    "mode ( also called sloshing mode or kohn mode @xcite ) frequencies allows to extract the debye length @xcite and the particle charge @xcite in complex plasmas .",
    "similarly , in @xcite the authors characterize a trapped one - dimensional bose gas by the frequency ratio of these two modes .",
    "numerous papers are devoted to the theoretical understanding of these low lying modes ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "however , there is a need for theories covering more complex cases , such as particles experiencing a friction depending on space and/or velocity , or anharmonic traps ,  . for dusty plasma it has been shown that a negative friction may appear due to ion absorption by grains and create active particles",
    "these features are also used to describe the so - called active brownian particles in the context of plasma physics @xcite or biological physics @xcite . in cold atoms experiments ,",
    "a space dependent friction may have important dynamical consequences for the stability of magneto - optical traps @xcite .",
    "finally , let us also mention that trapping anharmonicity may be essential to understand the dynamics of bose - einstein condensate @xcite .",
    "our goal in this paper is to introduce a simple method able to deal qualitatively with the center - of - mass ( c.o.m . ) of trapped particles systems , in situations where the friction may depend on space and/or velocity , and the trap may be anharmonic .",
    "this allows i ) to avoid the simulations of the full system , which may be numerically costly ii ) to emphasize the physical phenomena at play in the c.o.m motion in a simple qualitative analytical model .",
    "we then compare our findings with experimental measurements on a magneto - optical trap .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : scaling ansatz ] we introduce our model and the simplifying ansatz , which yields a prediction for the c.o.m . mode evolution . in section",
    "[ sec : test ] we perform numerical tests , confronting the simplified theory with direct simulations of a one dimensional plasma system . using different friction profiles and trapping potentials",
    ", we assess the validity of the method , and also emphasize its limitations .",

    "mode for an atomic cloud in a magneto - optical trap and predict that , for some parameters , the relaxation may change drastically as the number of atoms in the cloud is increased .",
    "this prediction is confirmed by experimental data obtained with a large magneto - optical trap of rb@xmath1 .",
    "let us consider a system of @xmath2 particles confined by a trapping potential @xmath3 , subject to binary interaction forces @xmath4 . to derive the motion of c.o.m .",
    "we consider the continuum limit of that system and write the first equation of the bogolyubov - born - green - kirkwood - yvon ( bbgky ) hierarchy plus a fokker - planck operator :    @xmath5 = \\delta_{\\mathbf{v}}\\left(df\\right)+\\boldsymbol\\nabla_{\\mathbf{v}}.\\left(\\kappa\\mathbf{v}f\\right)\\ ] ]    with @xmath6 the one - particle distribution , @xmath7 the diffusion coefficient and @xmath8 the friction which may depend on the space and/or velocity coordinates .",

    "let us stress that eq .",
    "is equivalent to langevin equations for the particle dynamics because we have made no assumption about the unknown function @xmath12 .",
    "however , solving the bbgky hierarchy is as difficult as solving langevin equations . in order to obtain our approximation of the c.o.m .",

    "motion does not depend explicitly on the particles interaction .",
    "note that this cancellation does not require any mean field hypothesis .",
    "however , it is important to remark that for an anharmonic potential and/or non constant friction , the interaction appears implicitly in the distribution profile @xmath22 , which is unknown .",
    "eq . is then not tractable .    to deal with the unknown distribution @xmath22 , we drastically simplify the problem by considering a dynamics ansatz to only take into account the c.o.m .",
    "motion of the particles : @xmath23 with @xmath24 and @xmath25 is a stationary solution of eq . .",
    "we also assume , without loss of generality , that @xmath26 . with this hypothesis all the time dependence in the dynamics",
    "is now included in the function @xmath27 which is simply equal to @xmath28 .",
    "when the local mean velocity in the stationary state does not vanish , we expect that one should rather use : @xmath29 in this article , we will stick to cases where @xmath30 .",

    ", we easily obtain : @xmath31 with @xmath32 the @xmath19 component of @xmath27 .",
    "this result gives a generalization of the kohn theorem @xcite where the whole system is spatially shifted .",
    "let us stress that in contrast with the constant friction case , even if it seems that the interactions do not appear , they are implicitly included in the shape of @xmath25 , and thus they modify the evolution of @xmath33 .",
    "in this section we present numerical tests on the validity of eq . for different friction profiles and trapping potentials .",
    "the continuous description used so far was convenient to develop the theory ; on the other hand numerical simulations are easier going back to particles .",
    "thus , we shall compare the theory   to direct @xmath2-body simulations .",
    "we integrate the @xmath2 langevin equations using the euler - maruyama method .",
    "this method is adequate to compute average quantities when one is not interested in the exact trajectories of particles @xcite .",
    "indeed , this scheme only uses one evaluation of the interaction forces at each time step and saves computation time in the most expensive part : the computation of binary forces , which is @xmath34 .",
    "we first reach a stationary state , and then at time @xmath35 we spatially shift the whole system , and monitor the c.o.m . dynamics .",
    "the benchmark system in this section is a trapped unidimensional plasma .",
    "it consists of @xmath2 particles confined by an external trap .",
    "we use a harmonic trap @xmath36 , except in section [ subsection : anharmonic trap ] .",
    "the particles interact through a repulsive one dimensional coulomb force . in this simple case",
    ", the force depends only on the relative position of the particles : @xmath37 , and it allows to perform @xmath2-body numerical simulations with a high number of particles , without considering an approximate algorithm scheme , such as a tree - code @xcite , to compute binary forces .",
    "another advantage of our choice is that it allows to use an analytical approximation of the stationary space distribution profile @xmath38 . in the limit of strongly interacting / cold plasma with constant friction ,",
    "the distribution profile is : @xmath39 as long as the typical size @xmath40 is larger than @xmath41 .",
    "remark that the size of the system varies linearly with the number of particles and the interaction strength . + we will now compare the results of the analytical model ( eq .  ) as well as the analytical expression of the stationnary solution ( eq .  ) to the numerical simulations",
    ". we will also see how a more precise knowledge of @xmath25 from simulations of the stationary state may increase the accuracy of eq .  .",
    "finally , we note that one expects a mean field description based on a vlasov - fokker - planck equation to be accurate in the regimes explored numerically .",
    "other tests would be needed to test the method in regimes where mean field descriptions break down .",
    "we start by considering the following friction profile : @xmath42 with @xmath43 a typical size and @xmath44 the friction value at @xmath45 .    a priori",
    ", there is no reason that the stationary density @xmath38 keeps the shape given in eq .  ; however our numerical simulations showed that eq .",

    "motion :    @xmath47    figures [ fig : friction space variable ] and [ fig : friction space variable 2 ] compare simulations and predictions with different perturbation amplitudes .",
    "a good agreement is obtained in strongly non - linear cases ; it is even better when the local friction felt by the particles decreases .",
    "the agreement is less good however when the friction strongly varies ( see figure [ fig : friction space variable 2 ] inset ) .",
    "a similar behavior was observed for the breathing oscillation with space variable friction in  @xcite and it is closely related to the ansatz assumption that the profile does not change during the oscillation . to give a schematic view ,",
    "let us consider two particles with the same velocity but with different positions .",
    "the first one being in a small friction area while the other one is highly damped .",
    "considering the same time step , the two particles do not cover the same distance .",
    "then the profile suffers some compression or dilatation , not included in the dynamical ansatz . in summary , if the friction varies a lot and its values are not negligible with respect to the trapping constant , one may the assumptions behind to be violated . the validity of our approach is thus related to the ratio friction / trapping , and we can summarize our findings as follows : if @xmath48 , or the relative fluctuations of @xmath49 are small in the whole the system , then the dynamical ansatz assumptions are well satisfied .    -body simulations and theoretical predictions given by for small and large perturbations .",

    "indeed by considering the linear expansion of eq .",
    "we obtain the simple criterion :    @xmath60    it leads to the critical number of particles ( or equivalently interaction strength in our specific example , see eq .  ):",
    "@xmath61    and we conclude that for the same range of parameters , the behavior of c.o.m . of the plasma",

    "it is commonly known in the cold - atoms community that this model is restricted to small mot @xcite , _ i.e. _ small number of particles . for large mot",
    "we have to consider two other contributions : an attractive force @xmath111 which comes from a screening effect , and a repulsive force which comes from multiple scattering . in the small optical width region , these two forces satisfy @xcite :    @xmath112 = -\\frac{\\sigma_l^2 i_0}{c } \\rho(\\mathbf{r})\\ ] ]    and    @xmath113 = \\frac{\\sigma_r\\sigma_l i_0}{c } \\rho(\\mathbf{r}),\\ ] ]    where @xmath114 ( resp .",

    "if we consider a perturbation along the @xmath93 direction , we obtain the condition :    @xmath121    we represent on figure  [ fig : sloshing mode for mot ] the different behaviors , depending on the detuning @xmath98 and the magnetic field @xmath122 when the size of the system increases _",
    "i.e. _ when the number of particles increase .",
    "it is possible to obtain three different behaviors depending on the parameter values : underdamped relaxation ; overdamped relaxation ; or the stationary state is unstable .",
    "this latter possibility corresponds to @xmath123 .",
    "this implies that @xmath124 can be negative and that a lot of particles lies in those regions .",
    "we will not discuss this case anymore since our numerical tests show that the method is unreliable when negative friction plays a role . an important feature shown in figure  [ fig : sloshing mode for mot ]",
    "is that for the same value of detuning and magnetic field , it is possible to observe a modification of the relaxation dynamics by increasing the number of atoms .",
    "for example , increasing @xmath71 from @xmath125  mm to @xmath126  mm with @xmath127 and @xmath128  g / cm , the relaxation of the center - of - mass changes from underdamped to overdamped . considering the friction profile obtained for those parameters ( see figure  [ fig : friction profile mot ] ) and using the same consideration as in section [ sec : test ] , we are able to understand this behavior : @xmath129 is just the average friction felt by the whole system ; the threshold separating overdamped and underdamped is obtained by comparing this average friction with @xmath130 .",
    "figure  [ fig : friction profile mot ] represent these quantities for harmonic trap to simplify as much as possible the discussion .",
    "when the size of the system is roughly between @xmath131  mm , the local friction at the edge of the system is higher than the critical friction , nevertheless the system is underdamped because the average friction stays below the threshold .",
    "for @xmath132  mm the system becomes overdamped . for an even larger cloud ,",
    "the friction decreases , the system may become underdamped again ( not seen in the figure ) .",
    "let us stress that we used a simple model based on doppler cooling to describe a mot and many phenomena are not included in our study : sub - doppler cooling is neglected ( this can be important for the c.o.m .",
    "relaxation in small systems ) ; the friction profile is assumed to be independent on the number of particles ; the `` effective charge '' in the interaction force is taken as a constant . we do not expect this model to predict exactly the transition between the different regimes ; however , in some cases the doppler model should be sufficient to describe qualitatively the system .",
    "note that @xcite shows that atomic properties may dramatically changes the relaxation : for alkaline - earth - metal atoms it is possible to observe underdamped oscillations @xcite , while the same regime with alkali - metal atoms shows a strongly overdamped relaxation @xcite .",
    "we present here some experimental evidence supporting the analysis developed in the previous section .",
    "our experimental setup has been described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we load a large magneto - optical trap containing up to 2@xmath133 rb@xmath1 atoms from a dilute room - temperature vapor .",
    "the mot employs 6 large ( waist = 4 cm ) independent laser beams , tuned slightly below ( typically by @xmath134 ) the @xmath135 transition of the @xmath89 line .",
    "an additional repumping beam is also applied to the atoms , whose intensity is used to control the number of atoms in the @xmath136 hyperfine level . to study the dynamics of the mot s center - of - mass",
    ", we image the fluorescence light of the cloud on a photodiode , with a mask blocking half of the mot s image ( see figure  [ fig : damping](a ) ) .",
    "this setup is thus sensitive to any displacement of the center - of - mass of the cloud in the plane orthogonal to the line of sight of the imaging optics .",
    "figure  [ fig : damping](b ) shows the measured impact of the atom number on the dynamics of the mot s center - of - mass . using an offset magnetic field",
    ", we displace the mot s center - of - mass .",
    "when this offset field is switched off at @xmath35 , the mot is free to evolve in the initial trapping conditions and the mot then returns to its equilibrium position .",
    "as shown on figure  [ fig : damping](b ) , for low atom number the dynamics of the center of mass is overdamped , typical for standard mots .",
    "however we observe a clear transition from an overdamped behavior at low atom number , to an underdamped one when the atom number is large .",
    "this cross - over is heralding the instability regime observed in @xcite .",
    "this transition to an underdamped motion of the center of mass of the mot before reaching the instability regime is similar to the narrow region indicated in blue in figure  [ fig : sloshing mode for mot ] separating the overdamped region from the instability region .",
    "in the present work we have introduced a dynamical ansatz to obtain an approximate evolution of the center - of - mass mode considering a trapped system of interacting particles , assuming a global translation of the whole system .",
    "this approach allows to describe numerous problems with arbitrary perturbation amplitudes of the center - of - mass mode .",
    "this includes systems with space and/or velocity dependent friction as well as anharmonic trapping potential .",
    "we have confronted the predictions of the simplified approach with direct @xmath2-body simulations of langevin equations , considering a one dimensional plasma with different friction and trap profiles as test case .",
    "the main conclusion is that the agreement is satisfactory as long as the hypotheses underlying the ansatz are well enough satisfied .",
    "using this approach on a model for a magneto - optical trap , we predict transitions between overdamped and underdamped motion for the center of mass of the cloud , as the number of trapped atoms increases .",
    "finally , we provide some experimental evidence for such a transition , thus confirming some of the predictions made .    note that we assume in this work a constant diffusion coefficient and an external force which derives from a potential .",
    "however it is straightforward to extend the dynamical ansatz method .",
    "for instance in the case of a space and/or velocity dependent diffusion or with rotational forces",
    ". finally a combination of the dynamical ansatz introduced in this paper and the scaling ansatz method detailed in @xcite may be useful to describe simultaneously the center - of - mass motion and the breathing mode oscillation @xcite ."
