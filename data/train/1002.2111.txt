    "we should also emphasize that the parameter that most affected the fits to the water lines was the freeze - out rate , as this directly affects the fractional abundance of water ( since the higher the freeze - out rate the more oxygen is hydrogenated as water on the surfaces of the grains before evaporating ) .",
    "based on the investigated models , shock temperatures in the 300 - 500  k range were found to produce acceptable fits to the line fluxes and profiles . * the pl2 model which fits the higher - excitation lines shown in figure [ agua_r2 ] makes a negligible contribution to the lower - excitation lines shown in figure [ agua_results1 ] , while the e2 model that fits the lower excitation lines makes a negligible contribution to the higher - excitation lines shown in figure [ agua_r2 ] . *",

    "<S> we present chemical and radiative transfer models for the many far - ir ortho- and para - h@xmath0o lines that were observed from the orion - kl region in high resolution fabry - prot ( fp ) mode by the long wavelength spectrometer ( lws ) on board the _ infrared space observatory ( iso)_. the chemistry of the region was first studied by simulating the conditions in the different known components of orion - kl : chemical models for a hot core , a plateau and a ridge were coupled with an accelerated @xmath1-iteration ( ali ) radiative transfer model to predict h@xmath2o line fluxes and profiles . </S>",
    "<S> our models include the first 45 energy levels of ortho- and para - h@xmath0o . </S>",
    "<S> we find that lines arising from energy levels below 560  k were best reproduced by a gas of density 3@xmath310@xmath4  @xmath5 at a temperature of 70 - 90  k , expanding at a velocity of 30  km  s@xmath6 and with a h@xmath0o / h@xmath0 abundance ratio of the order of 2 - 3 @xmath3 10@xmath7 , similar to the abundance derived by cernicharo et al . </S>",
