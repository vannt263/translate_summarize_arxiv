    ", we can predict the most preferred type of instability occurring in the ground - state of the system , corresponding to the most divergent correlation function : charge density wave ( @xmath105 ) , spin density wave ( @xmath106 ) , singlet superconductivity ( @xmath107 ) or triplet superconductivity ( @xmath108 ) . before discussing the results ,",
    "let us remark that the on - site and bond - site interaction constants have always opposite effects ; they occur only in the combination @xmath109 or , in the half - filled case , through @xmath110 or @xmath111 with a similar structure .",
    "consequently , a bond - site repulsion acts ( in the upper band ) as an effective attraction and its effect is enhanced by increasing the electron density @xmath72 , a fact already used in the hole superconductivity mechanism  @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath112 ( or @xmath113 ) fixes the position , in the ( @xmath96)-plane , of the intersection between the  spin - line \" ( @xmath114 ) and the  charge - line \" ( @xmath115 ) .",
    "let us first consider the half - filled case ( @xmath116 ) .",
    "the obtained phase diagram has the structure presented in fig .",
    "the  spin - line \" is vertical and the  charge - line \" is horizontal ; both of them delimit not only different phases , but also the strong coupling regime from the weak coupling one in each corresponding ( charge or spin ) sector .",
    "the critical value @xmath117 of the inter - site interaction constant separates a dominant superconductor region ( @xmath118 ) from a density fluctuation one ( @xmath119 ) .",
    "analogously , by decreasing the intra - bond interaction constant @xmath99 below the critical value @xmath120 , the triplet states ( spin - density or superconductor ) disappear . depending on the values of @xmath121 and @xmath122",
    ", the origin @xmath123 can be found in principle in any of the four regions , but the most probable case for a real system is that considered in the picture ( @xmath124 , @xmath125 ) .    in the non - half - filled case , @xmath126 is zero and consequently @xmath127 does not renormalize ; thus the charge sector is always in the weak coupling regime and the  charge - line \" now separates only different phases .",
    "graphically , two things happen : ( i ) the intersection between the  charge - line \" and the  spin - line \" moves in such a way that the origin @xmath123 lies inside either the region ii ( for @xmath124 ) or the region iv ( for @xmath128 ) ; ( ii ) by increasing the density @xmath72 , the  spin - line \" rotates anti - clockwise while the  charge - line \" rotates clockwise ( by decreasing @xmath72 , the effect is reversed ) .",
    "consequently , on starting from the half - filled case and increasing the electron concentration the regions i and iii become smaller while the regions ii and iv grow , as it is shown in fig . 4 for @xmath124 ; the intersection of the  spin - line \" with the coordinate axes are given respectively by @xmath120 and @xmath129 $ ] while in the  charge - line \" case by @xmath130 $ ] and @xmath131 $ ] .",
    "the effect of the model parameters on the ground - state phase diagram can easily be inferred from the above discussion .",
    "the use of the rg method implicitly assumes a weak coupling regime ; the scaling equations are obtained in the second order of the perturbation theory and consequently the coupling constants have to be small in comparison with the bandwidth . for the 3/4-filled undistorted @xmath0 chain we have @xmath132 ev with a gap @xmath133 ev  @xcite and from eq .",
    "( 5 ) it follows a bandwidth around 2.25 ev ( and thus a quite large gap ) . on the other hand , @xmath1343 - 4 ev , @xmath1351 - 3 ev  @xcite , i.e. we are in an intermediate coupling regime ; in this respect , our estimations for the @xmath0 chain presented below could provide only a qualitative description of the system .",
    "the restriction to the partial filled ( upper ) band , justified also in the weak coupling limit , supports the same conclusion .    excepting the on - site interaction , the values of the other coupling constants for the @xmath0 chain",
    "are less known . for a non - alternating chain , using a kronig - penny model for the ionic potential and a screened coulomb inter - electronic potential , campbell et al .",
    "@xcite analyzed the relative magnitude of the hubbard - type constants for various ratios of the overlap ( of the wannier functions ) and screening parameters : in general @xmath136 , but in the extreme screening limit @xmath137 .",
    "in most real problems , the effect of the exchange and pair hopping ( @xmath138 ) can be neglected and we shall assume this fact as valid also for an alternating chain .",
    "the phase diagram corresponding to a half - filled upper band ( see fig .",
    "3 ) in this case ( @xmath139 ) and in terms of the original coupling constants ( with @xmath140 , as for the @xmath0 chain ) looks like in fig .",
    "the oblique heavy line from fig .",
    "5 is defined by @xmath141 [ see eq .",
    "( 32 ) ] ( the dashed line corresponds to @xmath142 ) and it is independent of the inter - site coupling constant @xmath143 ; its slope depends only on the ratio @xmath144 .",
    "the two heavy halflines ( horizontal and vertical ) start from the point q , sliding on the dashed line by changing @xmath143 ( upwards by decreasing @xmath143 ; at @xmath145 , @xmath146 coincides with @xmath147 ) ; they delimit the region where a superconductor state can occur . as can be remarked from fig .",
    "5 ( drawn in the particular case @xmath148 ev ) the region of @xmath107 and @xmath108 ( denoted by i in fig .",
    "3 ) disappears for @xmath149 .",
    "the values of the inter - site and bond - site coupling constants for which the 3/4-filled undistorted @xmath0 chain is superconductor can be determined also from fig . 5 ;",
    "for example , in the particular case of @xmath145 , a superconductor state can be reached only if @xmath150 and @xmath151 [ see eq .",
    "( 32 ) ] . for a non - alternating chain",
    ", the same condition requires @xmath128 , i.e. @xmath152  @xcite [ see eq . ( 33 ) , where we replaced the renormalized coupling constants @xmath153 and @xmath154 by respectively @xmath155 and @xmath156 of a non - alternating chain ] . in order to get a superconductor state",
    ", we thus need a bigger ratio of the ( @xmath13 ) bond- and on - site couplings in the alternating case than in the non - dimerized one ; however , in average , the ratio is practically the same and we could conclude that , within the present formalism , the alternating structure does not play an essential role in the occurrence of superconductivity in this system .",
    "let us also note that for a non - alternating structure and in the extreme screening limit ( when @xmath143 can be neglected ) , the ratio ( computed from atomic orbitals ) @xmath157 has been estimated in the range 0.15  0.18  @xcite ; and it is closed to the value required for a superconductor state .",
    "finally , let us note that for realistic values of the parameters , there is a coexistence of @xmath105 and @xmath106 fluctuations in the system ( see the shaded rectangle from fig .",
    "this phase could be interpreted as follows : any allowed density modulation has a wave vector @xmath158 and consequently for the half - filled upper band the length wave of the density fluctuation is equal to two lattice constants . from the alternating structure it follows we could imagine @xmath106 and @xmath105 as located on @xmath13 and @xmath14 sublattices respectively ( a spin density wave requires a stronger on - site repulsion than a charge density one ) .",
    "the results of this paper can be summarized as follows : the canonical transformation diagonalizing the one - particle hamiltonian for an alternating chain with two non - equivalent sites per unit cell has been used to find the expressions of the hubbard - type interactions , initially introduced in the site - representation , in the corresponding two - band model ; the consideration has been restricted to the particular case of only alternating on - site energies ( and equal hopping amplitudes ) and a gap between the two bands large enough to take into account only the processes inside the partial filled band ( and we chose the upper band , as for the 3/4-filled @xmath0 chain ) .",
    "a particularity of the alternating structure manifests itself in the dependence of the obtained potentials on the momentum conservation in a given process , i.e. if it is normal or umklapp one .",
    "the rg method ( second order ) has then been applied to this ( one - band ) model hamiltonian ; all the @xmath3-constants have been obtained by evaluating the corresponding hubbard - type interactions around the fermi points .",
    "the resulting ground - state phase diagrams have been analyzed in terms of all coupling constants and for an arbitrary band filling .",
    "the effect of the bond - site interaction is to renormalize the on - site one . in the chosen coordinates ( intra - bond , inter - site ) and at half filling",
    ", a critical inter - site interaction controls the position of the  charge - line \" ( separating a dominant superconductor region from a density fluctuation one ) , and a critical intra - bond coupling determines the  spin - line \" ( separating a region of singlet states from one with possible triplet states ) ; the effect of the density is to rotate these two lines and to change the position of their crossing determined by a certain relation between the on - site and bond - site coupling constants .",
    "the particular case of the 3/4-filled undistorted @xmath0 chain has been discussed in a separate section , where the corresponding phase diagram has been drawn in terms of the original coupling constants ( neglecting @xmath138 term , usually very small ) ; the values of the inter - site and bond - site couplings required to get a superconductor state ( according to our approximate description ) have been also determined .",
