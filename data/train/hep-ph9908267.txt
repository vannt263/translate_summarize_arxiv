    "in the last years many papers have been devoted to experimental and theoretical studies of bose - einstein interference effects  @xcite in multiparticle production .",
    "it has been argued that these studies may allow for the reconstruction of space - time development of the interactions . in particular",
    ", different possibilities of implementing interference effects into monte carlo generators used for high energy hadroproduction processes were discussed . in this note",
    "we add some points to this discussion .",
    "we present in detail some aspects of the weight method of implementing be effect in the mc generators .",
    "in particular , we try to establish to what extent one may reconstruct the two - particle weight function ( related to the wigner function ) from the data on be effect . for this purpose",
    "we use the data on multiparticle production with highest statistics available - the hadronic decays of @xmath0 s produced in @xmath1 collisions .",
    "a short summary of various methods of implementing interference effects into monte carlo generators is presented in the next section . in the third section",
    "we discuss the data from different lep experiments on two - particle correlations from @xmath0 hadronic decays which were used for analyzing the bose - einstein effect .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the analysis of data in terms of the weight model . in particular , various choices of two - particle weight factors used in this method",
    "are compared .",
    "last section contains some conclusions and outlook for further investigations .",
    "the standard discussion of the be effect in multiparticle production  @xcite starts from the classical space - time source emitting identical bosons with known momenta .",
    "thus the most natural procedure is to treat the original monte carlo generator as the model for the source and to symmetrize the final state wave function  @xcite .",
    "this may be done in a more proper way using the formalism of wigner functions  @xcite . in any case , however , the monte carlo generator should yield both the momenta of produced particles and the space - time coordinates of their creation ( or last interaction ) points . even if we avoid troubles with the uncertainty principle by using the wigner function approach",
    ", such a generator seems reliable only for heavy ion collisions .",
    "it has been constructed also for the @xmath2 collisions  @xcite , but localizing the hadron creation point in the parton - based monte carlo program for lepton and/or hadron collisions is a rather arbitrary procedure , and it is hard to say what does one really test comparing such a model with data .",
    "it seems to be the best procedure to take into account the interference effects before generating events .",
    "unfortunately , this was done till now only for the jetset generator for a single lund string  @xcite , and a generalization for multi - string processes is not obvious .",
    "no similar modifications were yet proposed for other generators .",
    "the most popular approach , applied since years to the description of be effect in various processes , is to shift the final state momenta of events generated by the pythia/ + jetset generators  @xcite .",
    "the prescription for a shift is such as to reproduce the experimentallly observed enhancement in the ratio @xmath3 which is a function of a single invariant variable @xmath4 .",
    "the value of this function is close to one for the default jetset / pythia generator .",
    "one parametrizes often this ratio by @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are parameters interpreted as the source radius and `` incoherence strength '' , respectively .    after performing the shifts , all the cm 3-momenta of final state particles",
    "are rescaled to restore the original energy . in more recent versions of the procedure",
    "@xcite `` local rescaling '' is used instead of the global one . in any case , each event is modified and the resulting generated sample exhibits now the `` be enhancement '' : the ratio  ( [ eq : ratio ] ) is no longer close to one , and may be parametrized as in  ( [ eq : factor ] ) .    there is no theoretical justification for this procedure , so it should be regarded as an imitation rather than implementation of the be effect .",
    "its success or failure in describing data is the only relevant feature .",
    "unfortunately , whereas the method is very useful for the description of two - particle inclusive spectra , it fails to reproduce ( with the same fit parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) the three - particle spectra  @xcite and the semi - inclusive data  @xcite .",
    "this could be certainly cured , e.g. , by modifying the shifting procedure and fitting the parameters separately for each semi - inclusive sample of data . however , the fitted values of parameters needed in the input factor  ( [ eq : factor ] ) used to calculate shifts are quite different from the values one would get fitting the resulting ratio  ( [ eq : ratio ] ) to the same form  @xcite .",
    "this was shown recently in a much more detailed study  @xcite .",
    "thus it seems to be very difficult to learn something reliable on the space - time structure of the source from the values of fit parameters in this procedure .",
    "all this has led to the revival of weight methods , known for quite a long time  @xcite , but plagued with many practical problems .",
    "the method is clearly justified within the formalism of the wigner functions , which allows to represent ( after some simplifying assumptions ) any distribution with the be effect built in as a product of the original distribution ( without the be effect ) and the weight factor , depending on the final state momenta  @xcite . with an extra assumption of factorization in momentum space , we may write the weight factor for the final state with @xmath8 identical bosons as    @xmath9    where the sum extends over all permutations @xmath10 of @xmath8 elements , and @xmath11 is a two - particle weight factor reflecting the effective source size .",
    "a commonly used simple parametrization of this factor for a lorentz symmetric source is    @xmath12 , \\label{eq : wf}\\ ] ]    the only free parameter is now @xmath13 , representing the inverse of the effective source size .",
    "in fact , the full weight given to each event should be a product of factors  ( [ eq : weight ] ) calculated for all kinds of bosons ; in practice , pions of all signs should be taken into account . only direct pions and the decay products of @xmath14 and @xmath15 should be taken into account , since for other pairs much bigger @xmath6 should be used , resulting in negligible contributions .",
    "the main problem of the weight methods is that weights do change not only the bose - einstein ratio  ( [ eq : ratio ] ) , but also many other distributions .",
    "thus with the default values of free parameters ( fitted to the data without weights ) we find inevitably some discrepancies with data after introducing weights .",
    "we want to make clear that this can not be taken as a flaw of the weight method .",
    "there is no measurable world `` without the be effect '' , and it makes not much sense to ask , if this effect changes e.g. the multiplicity distributions . if any model is compared to the data without taking the be effect into account , the fitted values of its free parameters are simply not correct .",
    "they should be refitted with weights , and then the weights recalculated in an iterative procedure .",
    "this , however , may be a rather tedious task .",
    "therefore we use a simple rescaling method proposed by jadach and zalewski  @xcite . instead of refitting the free parameters of the mc generator , we rescale the be weights ( calculated according to the procedure outlined above ) with a simple factor @xmath16 , where @xmath8 is the global multiplicity of `` direct '' pions , and @xmath17 and @xmath18 are fit parameters .",
    "their values are fitted to minimize @xmath19 ^ 2/n^0(n ) \\label{eq : chi2}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the number of events for the multiplicity @xmath8 without weights , and @xmath21 is the weighted number of events .",
    "this rescaling restores the original multiplicity distribution  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the single longitudinal and transverse momentum spectra are also restored by this rescaling  @xcite .",
    "obviously , for a more detailed analysis of the final states , single rescaling may be not enough .",
    "e.g. , since different parameters govern the average number of jets and the average multiplicity of a single jet , both should be rescaled separately to avoid discrepancy with data .",
    "let us stress once again that such problems arise due to the use of generators with improperly fitted free parameters , and do not suggest any flaw of the weight method .",
    "another problem is that our formula for weights  ( [ eq : weight ] ) is derived using some approximations , which are rather difficult to control  @xcite .",
    "we can justify them only _ a posteriori _ from the phenomenological successes of the weight method .",
    "last but not least , the main practical difficulty with formula ( [ eq : weight ] ) is the factorial increase of the number of terms in the sum with increasing multiplicity of identical pions @xmath8 . for high energies , when @xmath8 often exceeds 20 , a straightforward application of formula ( [ eq : weight ] ) is impractical  @xcite , and some authors  @xcite replaced it with simpler expresssions , motivated by some models .",
    "it is , however , rather difficult to estimate their reliability .",
    "we have recently proposed two ways of dealing with this problem .",
    "one method consists of a truncation of the sum ( 3 ) up to terms , for which the permutation @xmath22 moves no more than 5 particles from their places  @xcite .",
    "however , it is difficult to claim a priori that such a truncation does not change the results which would be obtained using the full series ( 2 ) .    therefore a second way of an approximate calculation of the sum ( 2 ) was proposed  @xcite . since this sum , called a permanent of a matrix built from weight factors @xmath23 , is quite familiar in field theory , one may use a known integral representation and approximate the integral by the saddle point method .",
    "however , this method is reliable only if in each row ( and column ) of the matrix there is at least one non - diagonal element significantly different from zero .",
    "thus the prescription should not be applied to the full events , but to the clusters , in which each momentum is not far from at least one other momentum .",
    "the full weight is then a product of weights calculated for clusters , in which the full event is divided .",
    "the considerations presented above suggested the necessity of combining these two methods .",
    "after dividing the final state momenta of identical particles into clusters , we used for small clusters exact formulae presented in  @xcite . for large clusters",
    "( with more than five particles ) we compared two approximations ( truncated series and the integral representation ) to estimate their reliability and the sensitivity of the final results to the method .",
    "obviously , the results depend also on the clustering algorithm : if we restrict each cluster to particles very close in momentum space , the neglected contributions to the sum  ( [ eq : weight ] ) from permutations exchanging pions from different clusters may be non - negligible , and if the cluster definition is very loose , the saddle point approximation may be unreliable .",
    "this was then also checked to optimize the algorithm used .",
    "we found that the truncated series approximation was sufficient in all cases we checked on  @xcite .",
    "our method was already applied to the analysis of @xmath24 production  @xcite .",
    "extremely high statistics collected in lep for the hadronic decays of @xmath0-s produced in the @xmath1 collisions allowed to investigate in detail many interesting effects . in particular , the interference effects due to the bose - einstein statistics for pions were analyzed in several experiments .",
    "the notorious difficulty in measuring the bose - einstein interference effects ( be effects ) in the multiparticle production is the proper choice of reference sample . in the early investigations",
    "the ratio of numbers of `` like - to - unlike '' charged pion pairs was analyzed as a function of three- or four - momentum difference squared @xmath25d^3p_1 d^3p_2}{\\int\\rho_2^{+-}(p_1,p_2)\\delta[(p_1-p2)^2+q^2]d^3p_1d^3p_2 } \\label{eq:6}\\ ] ] obviously , the denominator has breit - wigner peaks around the values of @xmath26 corresponding to masses of resonances in the @xmath27system ( and other peaks due to the maxima in mass spectra from 3-pion resonances ) which are absent in the numerator .",
    "to estimate properly the be effects one should subtract these maxima , or to exclude the `` resonance regions '' from the @xmath26 range used in fitting @xmath28 to the chosen function .    therefore recently a more common choice for the denominator",
    "was the `` uncorrelated background '' formed e.g. by choosing pairs of `` like sign '' pions from different events , which led to the definition presented in the former section ( [ eq : ratio ] ) . here",
    "the main problem comes from neglecting the energy - momentum conservation effects ( present in the numerator and absent in the denominator ) .",
    "however , for high energies and restricted range of momenta ( e.g. the `` central region '' , often used for the analysis ) such effects are expected to be rather small .",
    "this method is easy to apply for hadronic or heavy ion collisions , where the initial momenta form the natural symmetry axis in the cm frame . for @xmath0",
    "decays the typical events are not aligned with the momenta of the initial @xmath1 pair .",
    "thus the momenta chosen from different events should be rotated to the same symmetry axis before calculating @xmath26 .",
    "unfortunately , such a procedure is not well - defined : using sphericity , thrust or other variables one obtains different values of rotation angles .",
    "moreover , the three- and many - jet events do not have well - defined symmetry axis , and limiting the analysis to the two - jet events would be rather arbitrary ( and dependent on the jet definition ) .       * fig.1 . * _ a ) the be ratio @xmath28 ( 6 ) from the opal data ( black points ) and from the jetset mc without be effect ( open points ) ; b ) the double ratio @xmath29 ( 7 ) from the same data .",
    "solid lines are fits to the form ( 8) [ 25 ] .",
    "_    therefore the best strategy seems to be using monte carlo generators , which are rather reliable for the process under discussion . instead of analyzing the be ratio",
    "@xmath28 one considers the `` double ratio '' , i.e. the ratio of @xmath30 given by the data and @xmath31 computed from the mc generated events @xmath32    analogous `` double ratio '' has been defined also for the first definition of the `` be ratio '' ( [ eq : ratio ] )  @xcite .",
    "the results obtained for two double ratios are inconsistent . in the following we use only the definition ( [ eq:7 ] ) , preferred recently by the experimental groups  @xcite .",
    "the data with largest statistics has been presented by the opal group both for @xmath29 and for @xmath28 .",
    "they compared the parameter values from the fits ( with resonance regions excluded ) to the function @xmath33(1+\\alpha x^2 ) .",
    "\\label{eq:8}\\ ] ] the data ( based on 3.6 milion of events ) were shown for @xmath34 and for @xmath35  @xcite .",
    "we remind here in fig.1 the data and fits for @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the values of @xmath7 and r differ quite significantly , as shown in table i.    table i. fits to opal data .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath13 is not a best measure of `` width in momentum space '' when one compares different shapes of the weight factor .",
    "it seems more natural to use @xmath38 , which is just the average value of @xmath4 for a given weight factor @xmath39 if we define @xmath40 as the `` effective source size '' we find a close relation between the fitted values of @xmath6 and the input values of @xmath41 .",
    "the ratio @xmath42 , quoted in the last column of table ii , is in the range @xmath43 for almost all values of @xmath13 and all shapes of the weight factor .    the first obvious conclusion from fig .",
    "4 is that the fits to the two experimental sets of data are strongly different .",
    "this is partly due to the gamow correction for the effect of electromagnetic final state interactions , which was used by opal and neglected by aleph .",
    "since it has been recently argued that this correction badly overestimates the effect  @xcite , we have shown also an estimate for the opal point without gamow correction ( obtained using the values for correction quoted in ref .",
    "now the two data points are much closer , but still they differ significantly .",
    "the values resulting from our generated samples cover quite a wide range both in @xmath7 and r. certainly it is possible to reproduce any of the experimental values by a suitable choice of the form and free parameters of our weight factors .",
    "however , we do not think it would give a valuable information on the `` proper '' choice of the weight factor reflecting the `` real '' space - time structure of the source .",
    "there are a few reasons for such scepticism .",
    "first , as noted in the previous section , the shape of `` experimental '' @xmath29 strongly depends on the quality of `` reference mc '' . since we know that already at @xmath44 the influence of ( poorly described ) @xmath45 and @xmath46 contributions",
    "distorts the shape , the fitted values of @xmath6 around @xmath47 are not very reliable .",
    "the situation is even less clear if one fits wider range of q using a more elaborate ansatz for @xmath29 ( e.g. ( [ eq:8 ] ) ) . here",
    "the choice of `` cut out resonance region '' may influence quite significantly the fit results .",
    "moreover , the method of implementing the be effect may influence the resonance contribution . for our method",
    "the absence of peaks or bumps in the double ratio for `` mc with weights '' over `` mc without weights '' ( as seen , e.g. , in fig .",
    "3 ) suggests that this is not the case ( the oscillations shown in fig .",
    "2 ) of ref .  @xcite may result from lower statistics ) .",
    "this should be also checked for any other method .",
    "second , the choice of `` direct '' pions affected by the be effects described in section 2 ( although the same in our method and in the sjoestrand s momentum shift method ) is by no means unique .",
    "in fact , even for the fastest - decaying resonances the effective `` source radius '' for the decay products should not be exactly the same as for the `` real direct pions '' .",
    "thus the choice of a single value of @xmath13 in our weight factor is certainly an oversimplification .",
    "the total exclusion of the decay products of long - living resonances is also an approximation : some of them may be born quite close to the collision point and contribute to the visible be effect .",
    "the selection and treatment of `` direct '' pions included in calculating weights ( or subject to the momentum shift in the sjestrand s method ) influences strongly the resulting value of @xmath7 .",
    "third , the standard fitting method of be ratios or double ratios is also a subject of criticism  @xcite .",
    "more plausible methods suggest bigger uncertainties of the fit parameters",
    ".    the situation would not improve if we add the other published data , which used much lower statistics  @xcite or different form of the fitted function  @xcite .",
    "one may shortly summarize that it is too early to deduce details of the source space - time structure from the existing data , even if we assume the applicability of all the assumptions used in formulating the weight method .",
    "another interesting feature is the relative stability of our results with respect to the detailed shape of two - particle weight factor .",
    "the fitted values of @xmath7 fall in the range of values 0.2 - 0.5 for all the functions considered .",
    "they are highest for the step function , lower for `` diffuse step function '' , still lower for a gaussian and lowest for the exponent .",
    "one may summarize that for the same `` half width '' of the weight factor function one gets higher value of @xmath7 if the function stays longer near the value of 1 at small q. as already noted , @xmath7 depends much stronger on the percentage of pions counted as `` direct '' .",
    "the values of @xmath7 below 1 reflect mainly the percentage of direct like - sign pion pairs , which was already observed when using sjstrand s method of be effect implementation  @xcite .",
    "a new result is the observed relative insensitivity of the results on the oscillations in the two - particle weight factor .",
    "in fact , the oscillation half - period serves as an effective range of correlations if it is smaller than @xmath13 .",
    "therefore @xmath41 is almost the same for all the values of @xmath13 quoted in the table ii .",
    "the non - positive oscillating values of weight factor for larger q do not result in the values of @xmath29 oscillating around 1 , as one could naively expect ; averaging over many pairs in each event and over many events kills any trace of oscillations .",
    "this is quite important , as many simple forms of weight factor in space - time ( e.g. the step function ) results in oscillating form in momentum space .    on the other hand , there is an obvious dependence of fitted values of r on the parameter @xmath13 ( or @xmath41 ) , which determine how fast the weight factor decreases with increasing q. @xmath42 has quite similar values for various shapes of the weight factors and various values of @xmath13 .",
    "thus in our method r reflects in some sense the `` source size '' , as expected . as already noted ,",
    "this is true also for the oscillations in momentum space . increasing @xmath13",
    "one increases also fitted values of @xmath7 , but this effect is weaker .",
    "we have analyzed the data on be effect in multihadron states obtained from @xmath0 decays within the framework of the weight method of implementing the effect .",
    "we show that the resonance contributions are not satisfactorily described by the standard mc generators , which makes the analysis of `` double ratio '' data quite difficult . in particular , the choice of the `` proper '' two particle weight factor which would describe the data best is obviously dependent on the way the data are processed",
    ". thus one should improve ( if possible ) the quality of mc generators before drawing any serious conclusion on the agreement or disagreement between the models and data on the be effect .",
    "the alternative is to elaborate better methods of preparing the `` reference sample '' using only the like - sign pairs , which are much less affected by the resonance effects .    on the other hand",
    ", we found that the analysis makes no great difference between the positively defined and oscillating weight factors in momentum space , provided they correspond to similar `` half - width '' .",
    "this means that the results are not too strongly dependent on the `` sharpness of the source boundary '' in space - time ; one may hope to recover the proper `` source size '' in our method .",
    "let us stress that the analysis presented in this paper is just the first step : we do not discuss the anisotropy of source nor the time dependence reflected in the be effect . also , we do not consider here the possibilities of comparing the effect for selected classes of events ( defined i.e. by multiplicity , by event shape parameters or by some special triggers ) . in our opinion ,",
    "the weight method is well suited to discuss these subjects and we hope to consider them in near future .",
