    "the @xmath2 reaction is currently considered to be one of the astrophysically most important nuclear reactions , as its low - energy cross section determines the high - energy solar neutrino flux @xcite . recently there has been a great deal of experimental and theoretical activities investigating this process .",
    "the low - energy cross section has been studied directly by using a radioactive @xmath5be target and a proton beam @xcite , in inverse kinematics by using a @xmath5be beam and a proton target @xcite , indirectly from the coulomb dissociation of @xmath0b @xcite , and by extracting the @xmath6 nuclear vertex constant from the @xmath7 reaction @xcite . on the theoretical side some effects of @xmath5be deformations @xcite and three - body dynamics @xcite have been studied , and efforts to understand the nuclear vertex constant have been made @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have shown that the zero - energy cross section of the @xmath2 reaction scales linearly with the , unfortunately yet unknown , quadrupole moment of @xmath5be . in the present paper",
    "we extend this study and investigate the relation between the zero - energy cross section and several @xmath0b `` size '' properties .    in our approach",
    "we study the ground state properties of @xmath5be and @xmath0b as well as the @xmath8 reaction cross section consistently within the microscopic eight - body @xmath9 cluster model . as this model has been discussed before we refer the reader to refs .",
    "@xcite for details of the theoretical background . as customary in nuclear astrophysics",
    "we define the cross sections in terms of the astrophysical @xmath10 factor @xmath11 } , \\hskip 0.5 cm \\eta ( e)={{z_1z_2e^2}\\over{\\hbar v } } , \\ ] ] where @xmath12 are the charges of the two colliding nuclei , and @xmath13 is their relative velocity .    at low , and in particular , at solar energies the @xmath14 reaction is highly peripheral , which means that only the external parts of the bound- and scattering wave functions contribute to the radiative capture cross section @xcite .",
    "the external wave functions are known with the exception of the asymptotic normalization constant , @xmath15 , of the @xmath0b bound state @xcite .",
    "consequently the energy dependence of the low - energy @xmath16 factor is well - known ( e.g. refs .",
    "its absolute value , however , depends on @xmath17 and has thus to be determined experimentally .",
    "nevertheless theoretical constraints on the asymptotic normalization constant might be quite useful .",
    "we note that @xmath15 depends mainly on the effective @xmath5be@xmath18 interaction radius . a larger radius results in a lower coulomb barrier , which leads to a higher tunneling probability into the external region , and hence to a higher cross section",
    ". a possible way to constrain the interaction radius is to study some key properties of the @xmath19 and 8 nuclei @xcite .",
    "the observables that are most sensitive to the interaction radius are `` size - like '' properties , for example , quadrupole moment , radius , coulomb displacement energy @xcite , etc .",
    "these are the quantities which we will calculate in our microscopic cluster model and then study their effect on the astrophysical @xmath10 factor .",
    "in ref .  @xcite we demonstrated that there is a linear correlation between the zero - energy astrophysical @xmath10 factor , @xmath1 , of the @xmath8 reaction and the quadrupole moment of @xmath5be , @xmath22 .",
    "the @xmath22 quadrupole moment has not been measured yet , but in ref .",
    "@xcite we have predicted it to be between @xmath23 e@xmath4@xmath24 and @xmath25 e@xmath4@xmath24 .",
    "the absolute scale of the @xmath26 correlation , however , depends on the applied effective nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath27 ) interaction . for our preferred mn interaction",
    "this resulted in @xmath28 ev@xmath4b @xcite .",
    "other interactions gave slightly larger or smaller @xmath1 values , but these interactions were found to be inferior to the mn force for other observables .",
    "now we will turn to the other `` size - like '' observables and their potential constraints on @xmath1 . for this purpose",
    "we have repeated the microscopic calculations described in ref .",
    "@xcite varying the size parameter of the @xmath29he and @xmath30he clusters while keeping other important ingredients of the calculation fixed .",
    "again as in ref .",
    "@xcite we have performed these calculations for several interactions ( mn force @xcite , v2 interaction @xcite , and mhn interaction @xcite ) .",
    "our calculation thus reproduces the @xmath26 plot shown in fig .  1 of ref",
    ".  @xcite .    in the present fig .",
    "1 we extend the study of ref .",
    "@xcite and investigate the relation of @xmath1 to several size - like properties of @xmath0b : ( a ) the @xmath0b radius r(@xmath0b ) , ( b ) the difference between the @xmath5be and @xmath0b radii quantified by @xmath31 , ( c ) the @xmath0b quadrupole moment , and ( d ) the @xmath32 coulomb displacement energy .",
    "these calculations have been performed for the same model spaces and interactions as in ref .",
    "importantly all four indicators scale linearly with @xmath1 .",
    "this is caused by the ` halo ' structure of the @xmath0b ground state @xcite and reflects that the @xmath5be(p,@xmath33)@xmath0b reaction at low energies is an external capture process . in the following",
    "we will discuss the four indicators in turn and will try to derive at possible constraints on @xmath1 .",
    "first , the comparison is performed for the consistent eight - body @xmath30he+@xmath29he+p calculation using the mn force ; the dependence of our results on the model space and the interaction employed will be discussed below .",
    "the size property that is most sensitive to the effective @xmath34 interaction radius is @xmath31 .",
    "however , a precise experimental determination of this quantity is very difficult .",
    "in fact , during the course of the work reported in ref .  @xcite it seemed hopeless that the @xmath5be or @xmath0b radius could be measured with relatively high precision .",
    "the radii of nuclei far from stability are usually extracted from interaction cross section measurements by using glauber - type models with uniform density distribution for the nuclei @xcite .",
    "recently , a new and more precise method has been introduced @xcite which considers the few - body structure of the nuclei involved ( like @xmath6 for @xmath0b ) , while extracting the radius from the measured interaction cross sections .",
    "for @xmath0b the resulting point - nucleon radius is @xmath35 fm , and hence @xmath36 @xmath24 .",
    "we note , that for @xmath5be the model of ref .",
    "@xcite still uses the glauber estimate .",
    "our calculation reported in ref .",
    "@xcite gives @xmath37 fm and thus overestimates the experimental value .",
    "as expected we observe that @xmath1 decreases with decreasing @xmath0b radius . using the linear relationship between @xmath38 and @xmath1 and the experimental value for the @xmath0b radius places the cross section into the range @xmath39 ev b. ref .",
    "@xcite found @xmath40 @xmath24 , which appears to be a reasonable value .",
    "however , due to the uncertainties in the phenomenological value the derivation of a constraint on @xmath1 from @xmath41 is currently not possible .",
    "the experimental value of the @xmath0b quadrupole moment is @xmath42 e@xmath4@xmath24 @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite we calculated a slightly larger value , @xmath43 @xmath24 . like in the case of the @xmath0b radius , @xmath1 increases linearly with the @xmath0b quadrupole moment . from a comparison to the experimental data we find the constraint @xmath44 ev b ( fig",
    ". 1c ) .    to derive a phenomenological value for the coulomb displacement energy to be compared with our calculated values",
    ", we have to consider that the physics that accounts for the nolen - schiffer effect @xcite is not present in our model .",
    "this effect is estimated to cause a @xmath45130 kev shift in the @xmath32 coulomb displacement @xcite .",
    "so we should compare our results to a phenomenological value of @xmath46 mev .",
    "@xcite found a too small coulomb displacement energy , @xmath47 mev . from fig .",
    "1d we observe that @xmath1 decreases linearly with @xmath48 ; thus the experimental value for the coulomb displacement energy corresponds to @xmath49 ev b.    we can summarize the results for the complete @xmath30he+@xmath29he+p cluster study ( with the mn force ) of ref .",
    "@xcite as follows : this calculation @xcite gives consistently values for those indicators , for which reliable experimental data exist , which point to the use of a too large @xmath5be+p interaction radius .",
    "this implies that the value for @xmath1 ( 26.1 ev b ) predicted in @xcite is too large .",
    "we note that , by slightly varying the interaction radius , all three experimentally determined `` size - like '' parameters ( the @xmath0b radius and quadrupole moment and the coulomb displacement energy ) can consistently be reproduced ( see table 1 ) ; the corresponding value for the @xmath5be(p,@xmath33)@xmath0b reaction cross section then is @xmath3 ev@xmath4b .",
    "how much do our results depend on the chosen model space and the adopted interaction ? to answer these questions",
    "we have at first performed a series of restricted calculations involving only ( @xmath50 configurations ( @xmath6 like configurations ) rather than all possible arrangements of the three clusters .",
    "( as in all calculations reported in this paper the experimental value of the @xmath0b binding energy relative to the @xmath6 threshold has been reproduced by a slight modification in the @xmath27 interaction , see ref .",
    "again we find that @xmath1 scales linearly with all indicators . from fig .  1 we also observe that , for a fixed value of @xmath1 , the extension of the model space ( going from the restricted space to the full three - cluster model ) reduces the @xmath0b radius slightly , but increases the @xmath0b quadrupole moment and the coulomb displacement energy .",
    "the reason why the radius ( a ) and the quadrupole moment ( c ) of @xmath0b change in opposite direction if the model space is enlarged is that the addition of the @xmath51 and @xmath52 channels brings in large charge polarization which increases the quadrupole moment even if @xmath38 is reduced .",
    "even if we allow the variation of the @xmath5be+p interaction radius , the restricted model space calculation does not simultaneously reproduce the experimental data for our indicators ( see table 1 ) . while the @xmath0b radius and the coulomb displacement energy puts @xmath1 at around @xmath53 ev b , the @xmath0b quadrupole moment favors a larger value of @xmath54 ev b. in fact , the @xmath0b quadrupole moment is the quantity which is clearly most sensitive to the model space . note that enlargening the model space does not only reduce @xmath1 for fixed value of @xmath55 , it also changes the slope of the @xmath56 scaling .",
    "obviously the reproduction of the @xmath0b quadrupole moment requires a 3-body approach and is sensitive to the internal structure of the clusters .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been observed that the @xmath26 scaling depends on the adopted nn interaction .",
    "we have therefore repeated the @xmath57-type model calculations with two other interactions ( v2 and mhn ) .",
    "we observe that , for fixed values of the @xmath0b radius , of the @xmath41 difference and of the coulomb displacement , the rather repulsive v2 interaction gives larger @xmath1 values than the mn interaction , while the mhn interaction gives smaller values . assuming a linear relation betwen @xmath1 and our indicators , constraints on the zero - energy s - factor can be derived ; the corresponding values are listed in table 1 . for the mhn interaction",
    "we find that the @xmath0b quadrupole moment and the other indicators are not simultaneously reproduced in the restricted model space . for the v2 interaction the @xmath0b quadrupole moment and radius and the coulomb displacement energy are reproduced for a @xmath5be+p interaction radius corresponding to @xmath58 ev b. however , for this value of @xmath1 the @xmath41 difference becomes unreasonably large .",
    "we note again that a measurement of the @xmath5be quadrupole moment would place some additional constraints on the consistency of our calculations .",
    "for the complete @xmath30he+@xmath29he+p model calculation the simultaneous reproduction of the indicators predict @xmath22 to be in the range @xmath59 e @xmath24 . however , this value is smaller than the one ( @xmath60 e@xmath4@xmath24 @xcite ) obtained if we chose the cluster size parameters such to reproduce the quadrupole moment of the analog nucleus @xmath5li .",
    "does this already point to the necessity of a further enlargement of the model space beyond the @xmath9 three - cluster model which would then also effect our results obtained for @xmath5be , e.g. , change the @xmath5be quadrupole moment ? to investigate this we have performed calculations for @xmath5be in which we have added the @xmath61 configuration to the @xmath62 model space , adopted above . in all cases the exchange mixture parameter of the @xmath27 interaction was fixed to reproduce the @xmath5be binding energy relative to the @xmath62 threshold .",
    "we also made sure that the @xmath63 threshold was correctly reproduced .",
    "our results show that @xmath64 is increased by @xmath65 e@xmath4@xmath24 in the coupled - channel model relative to the single - channel @xmath66 value perhaps suggesting the need for an even larger model space than the complete @xmath30he+@xmath29he+p model space adopted here . which consequences such an enlargement might have on @xmath1 has to wait for @xmath0b calculations performed in larger model spaces , which are beyond @xmath67 .",
    "in summary , we have adopted a microscopic @xmath67 cluster model to calculate the @xmath0b radius and quadrupole moment , the difference in the @xmath5be and @xmath0b radii , @xmath41 , and the coulomb displacement energy @xmath32 and to study their relation to the @xmath1 astrophysical @xmath10 factor .",
    "we find that all these indicators scale linearly with the zero - energy @xmath5be(p,@xmath33)@xmath0b cross section .    within our three - cluster model",
    "we find that the experimentally determined values for the @xmath0b radius and quadrupole moment as well as the coulomb displacement energy is consistently described if the internal cluster size parameters are chosen such that the values for @xmath1 are between ( @xmath68 ) ev@xmath4b .",
    "this range is more or less compatible with the value currently used in most solar models , @xmath69 ev@xmath4b @xcite .",
    "however , it is slightly inconsistent with the recently adopted new experimental value @xmath70 ev@xmath4b @xcite .    as a note of caution",
    "we mention that this result has been derived from a linear relation between our four indicators and @xmath1 found in our three - cluster model .",
    "however , we found that enlarging the @xmath5be model space by adding a @xmath71 configuration to the @xmath62 configuration increased the @xmath5be quadrupole moment by about @xmath72 . to investigate the effects which additional configuration might have on the @xmath0b properties and in particular on the @xmath1 value , requires calculations in model spaces which are beyond @xmath73 .",
