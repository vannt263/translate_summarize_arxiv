    "measurements of weak boson pair production at hadron colliders are vital for testing the standard model and probing beyond it .",
    "these processes are particularly important because they can be used to probe the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism and test the triple weak boson couplings @xcite .",
    "the process @xmath3 is of interest as a test of the standard model .",
    "in addition , this process is sensitive to contact interactions which appear in composite models of gauge bosons @xcite , and it can also be used to search for evidence of anomalous @xmath4 and @xmath5 couplings @xcite . in order to perform such tests it is imperative to have precise calculations of hadronic @xmath6 production .",
    "futhermore , the calculations should include the leptonic decay of the @xmath7 boson since the @xmath7 boson is identified by its leptonic decay products .    at leading order in qcd [ @xmath8 , hadronic @xmath6 production proceeds via the quark - antiquark annihilation subprocess @xmath9 .",
    "this process was first calculated in ref .",
    "@xmath6 events can also be produced at leading order by the photon bremsstrahlung process @xcite which proceeds via subprocesses such as @xmath10 followed by photon bremsstrahlung from the final state quark .",
    "this process becomes significant only at supercollider center of mass energies .",
    "the production of @xmath6 in association with one or two jets was calculated in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the gluon fusion subprocess @xmath11 , which proceeds via a quark box loop , was calculated in refs .",
    "although this process is of order @xmath12 , it can be important at supercollider energies due to the large gluon luminosity ; the gluon fusion cross section is 1530% as large as the @xmath13 born cross section at supercollider energies @xcite .",
    "the qcd radiative corrections to hadronic @xmath6 production were calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite for the case of a real @xmath7 boson in the final state .    in this paper , the calculation in ref .",
    "@xcite is extended to include the leptonic decay of the @xmath7 boson .",
    "since the @xmath7 boson is identified via its leptonic decay products , the inclusion of the leptonic decay in the calculation makes it much more useful for comparing with experimental data .",
    "for example , cuts can now be applied to the final state leptons , thus allowing one to more closely mimic the actual experimental conditions .    to date , the cdf and d0 experiments at the fermilab tevatron collider have collected 12 @xcite and 6 @xcite @xmath6 events , respectively .",
    "both experiments are expected to collect data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of approximately 100  pb@xmath14 by the end of the current collider run ( run 1b ) .",
    "this represents a five fold increase in statistics over the presently available data sample .",
    "larger cross sections and luminosities are expected at the lhc .",
    "thus it should soon be possible to use hadronic @xmath6 production to probe the standard model .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the formalism used in the calculation is briefly reviewed in sec .",
    "ii , numerical results for the tevatron and lhc center of mass energies are given in sec .",
    "iii , and summary remarks are given in sec .",
    "the formalism used in the calculation is reviewed in this section .",
    "the discussion will be brief since the formalism has already been described in the literature .",
    "the calculation is done by using a monte carlo method for next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) calculations @xcite in combination with helicity amplitude methods @xcite .",
    "details on the nlo calculation of hadronic @xmath6 production for a real @xmath7 boson in the final state can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite and helicity amplitude calculations of @xmath6 production are described in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the calculation is done using the narrow width approximation for the decaying @xmath7 boson .",
    "this simplifies the calculation greatly for two reasons .",
    "first of all , it is possible to ignore feynman diagrams in which the photon is radiated off one of the final state lepton lines without violating electromagnetic gauge invariance .",
    "[ radiative @xmath7 decay events can be suppressed by a suitable choice of cuts ; see sec .",
    "secondly , in the narrow width approximation it is particularly easy to extend the nlo calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite to include the leptonic decay of the @xmath7 boson .",
    "the qcd radiative corrections to hadronic @xmath6 production were calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite for the case of a real @xmath7 boson in the final state .",
    "the present calculation extends the results of ref .",
    "@xcite to include the leptonic decay of the @xmath7 boson .",
    "the procedure for incorporating the leptonic decay @xmath15 into the nlo calculation of hadronic @xmath6 production is the same as that used in ref .",
    "@xcite for incorporating the leptonic decay @xmath16 into a nlo calculation of hadronic @xmath17 production . a detailed discussion of the procedure is given in ref .",
    "@xcite . basically , except for the virtual contribution",
    ", all the nlo contributions for real @xmath18 production have the form @xmath19 \\ > , \\label{eq : nloform}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the lowest order born cross section , @xmath21 is the quark - gluon vertex color factor , and @xmath22 is the strong running coupling .",
    "thus the leptonic decays can be incorporated by simply making the replacement @xmath23 in the formulas of ref .",
    "@xcite for nlo real @xmath18 production .",
    "the simple replacement described in the previous paragraph does not hold for the virtual correction .",
    "for this contribution we use the virtual correction for a real on - shell @xmath7 boson which we subsequently decay ignoring spin correlations . since the virtual corrections are small [ about 1% as large as the born cross section ] and the effects of spin correlations are small , the overall result of ignoring spin correlations in the virtual correction is negligible compared to the 20% ",
    "30% uncertainty from the parton distribution functions and the choice of the scale @xmath24 .",
    "[ note that spin correlations are included everywhere in the calculation except in the virtual contribution . ]",
    "numerical results for nlo @xmath6 production at the tevatron [ @xmath25 collisions at @xmath26  tev ] and the lhc [ @xmath27 collisions at @xmath28  tev ] are presented in this section .",
    "this section begins with a brief description of the input parameters and acceptance cuts .",
    "the numerical results presented in this section were obtained using the two - loop expression for @xmath22 .",
    "the qcd scale @xmath29 is specified for four flavors of quarks by the choice of the parton distribution functions and is adjusted whenever a heavy quark threshold is crossed so that @xmath22 is a continuous function of @xmath24 .",
    "the heavy quark masses were taken to be @xmath30  gev and @xmath31  gev @xcite .",
    "the standard model parameters used in the numerical simulations are @xmath32  gev , @xmath33  gev , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 .",
    "these values are consistent with recent measurements at the cern @xmath36 collider lep @xcite , the stanford linear collider @xcite , the cern @xmath37 collider @xcite , and the fermilab tevatron collider @xcite .",
    "the soft and collinear cutoff parameters used in the nlo monte carlo formalism ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) are fixed to @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the parton subprocesses have been summed over @xmath40 , and @xmath41 quarks .",
    "the leptonic branching fractions and the total width of the @xmath7 boson are @xmath42 and @xmath43  gev , respectively .",
    "a single scale @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the invariant mass of the @xmath6 pair , has been used for the renormalization scale @xmath46 and the factorization scale @xmath47 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a definition of these scales ) .",
    "the numerical results were obtained using the martin - roberts - stirling ( mrs )  @xcite set a parton distribution functions with @xmath48  mev .",
    "these distribution functions have been fit to next - to - leading order in the @xmath49 ( modified minimal subtraction ) scheme @xcite , which is the scheme used for the present calculation .",
    "the cuts imposed in the numerical simulations are motivated by the finite acceptance and resolution of the detector .",
    "the finite acceptance of the detector is simulated by cuts on the four - vectors of the final state particles .",
    "these cuts include restrictions on the transverse momentum @xmath50 and rapidity @xmath51 of the photon and leptons .    since detectors are generally best equipped to measure photons which are isolated , _",
    "i.e. _ , not accompanied by a large amount of nearby energy @xcite , a photon isolation cut will be applied in the numerical simulation .",
    "first , the leptons and photon are required to be separated in the pseudorapidity - azimuthal - angle plane @xmath52^{1/2 } \\>.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] a separation cut of @xmath53 will be imposed .",
    "in addition , a photon isolation cut typically requires the sum of the hadronic energy @xmath54 in a cone of size @xmath55 about the direction of the photon to be less than a fraction @xmath56 of the photon energy @xmath57 , _ i.e. _ , @xmath58 with @xmath59^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "a photon isolation cut with @xmath60  @xcite and @xmath61 will be applied in the numerical results presented in this section .",
    "this cut suppresses the portion of the cross section that comes from the photon bremsstrahlung process , which is beneficial since this process is not well understood theoretically .    before summarizing the cuts , it is useful to discuss cuts which will suppress radiative @xmath7 decays . since photon radiation from the final state lepton lines",
    "is ignored in the calculation , it is necessary to impose cuts which will efficiently suppress contributions from these diagrams . in radiative",
    "@xmath7 decays the lepton - photon separation in @xmath62 space peaks sharply at small values due to the collinear singularity associated with the diagrams in which the photon is radiated from a final state lepton line",
    ". a separation cut on @xmath63 , which has already been adopted , will therefore suppress radiative @xmath7 decay events .",
    "contributions from radiative @xmath7 decay can be further reduced by a cut on the @xmath64 invariant mass . in radiative",
    "@xmath7 decays the @xmath64 system has an invariant mass @xmath65 close to @xmath66 , whereas for @xmath6 production @xmath65 is always larger than @xmath66 if finite @xmath7-width effects are ignored .",
    "thus @xmath64 events originating from radiative @xmath7 decays can be suppressed if @xmath65 is required to be slightly above @xmath66 . note that this requirement is automatically satisfied in the present calculation since putting the @xmath7 boson on the mass shell and demanding the photon to have @xmath67",
