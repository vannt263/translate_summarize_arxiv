    "<S> wang and landau proposed recently , a simple and flexible non - boltzmann monte carlo method for estimating the density of states , from which the macroscopic properties of a closed system can be calculated . </S>",
    "<S> they demonstrated their algorithm by considering systems with discrete energy spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the wang - landau algorithm does not perform well when the system has continuous energy spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we propose in this paper modifications to the algorithm and demonstrate their performance on a lattice model of liquid crystalline system ( with lebwohl - lasher interaction having continuously varying energy ) , exhibiting transition from high temperature isotropic to low temperature nematic phase .    </S>",
    "<S> introduction monte carlo methods have emerged as a powerful and reliable tool for simulating several complex phenomena in statistical physics , see _ </S>",
    "<S> e.g. _ @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the metropolis algorithm @xcite discovered in the middle of the last century can be considered as the starting point . </S>",
    "<S> this algorithm generates a markov chain , the asymptotic part of which contains microstates belonging to a canonical ensemble at a temperature chosen for the simulation . </S>",
    "<S> expectation value of a macroscopic property can be estimated by taking a simple arithmetic average over a monte carlo sample . </S>",
    "<S> the associated statistical error is inversely proportional to the square root of the sample size . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in principle , we can estimate a physical property to the desired accuracy by simply increasing the sample size . </S>",
    "<S> however , if successive microstates in the sampled markov chain are correlated , the statistical error increases by a factor @xmath0 , see _ </S>",
    "<S> e.g. _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , where @xmath1 is the integrated correlation time . </S>",
    "<S> such a situation obtains when we simulate a system close to criticality .    the metropolis algorithm and </S>",
    "<S> its several variants like glauber @xcite , heat - bath @xcite and kawasaki exchange @xcite algorithms come under the class of boltzmann sampling techniques . </S>",
    "<S> the limitations of boltzmann sampling have long since been recognized . </S>",
    "<S> for example it can not address satisfactorily problems of critical slowing down , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ divergence of @xmath1 with increase of system size , near continuous phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> cluster algorithms @xcite overcome this problem . </S>",
    "<S> boltzmann sampling is also not suitable for problems of super critical slowing down near first order phase transitions . </S>",
    "<S> the microstates representing the interface between ordered and disordered phases have intrinsically low probability of occurrence in a closed system and hence are scarcely sampled ; switching from one phase to the other takes a very long time due to the presence of high energy barriers when the system size is large ; as a result the relative free energies of ordered and disordered phases can not be easily and accurately determined . </S>",
    "<S> finally it is quite difficult to estimate the absolute values of entropy or free energies in boltzmann sampling techniques .      that non - boltzmann sampling can provide a legitimate and often superior alternative to boltzmann sampling </S>",
    "<S> was recognized even during the early days of monte carlo practice , see _ </S>",
    "<S> e.g. _ @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the practical convenience and significance of non - boltzmann sampling was appreciated only in the middle of seventies when torrie and valleau @xcite proposed the so called umbrella sampling ; this is a fore - runner to all the subsequent non - boltzmann sampling techniques including the multicanonical monte carlo @xcite and its several and recent variants . </S>",
    "<S> entropic sampling @xcite , equivalent to multicanonical sampling @xcite , provides a transparent and intuitively appealing insight into non - boltzmann monte carlo techniques . </S>",
    "<S> it is based on the following premise .    </S>",
    "<S> the probability that a closed system can be found in a microstate @xmath2 is given by @xmath3^{-1}\\exp\\big[-\\beta e ( { \\cal c})\\big].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the above @xmath4 is the energy of the microstate @xmath2 and @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath7 is the temperature . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath8 is the canonical partition function given by , @xmath9\\nonumber\\\\           & = & \\int d(e)\\exp(-\\beta e)de,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the density of states . </S>",
    "<S> the probability density for a closed system to have an energy @xmath11 is given by , @xmath12 where the suffix @xmath13 indicates that it is the boltzmann - gibbs distribution ( appropriate for modeling a closed system ) . </S>",
    "<S> let us suppose we want to sample microstates in such a way that the resultant probability density of energy is given by , @xmath14^{-1}\\label{g_ensemble},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is chosen as per the desired non - boltzmann distribution . once @xmath16 is known , an ensemble consistent with eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ g_ensemble ] ) can be constructed as follows .    </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath17 be the current microstate and @xmath18 the trial microstate obtained from @xmath17 by making a local change , _ </S>",
    "<S> e.g. _ flip a randomly chosen spin in ising model simulation . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath19 and @xmath20 denote the energy of the current and of the trial microstate , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the next entry @xmath21 in the markov chain is taken as , @xmath22 where the acceptance probability @xmath23 is given by , @xmath24 \\equiv { \\rm min}\\left [ 1,\\ \\frac{g(e_i)}{g(e_t)}\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we call this non - boltzmann sampling with respect to a given @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> it is easily verified that the above acceptance rule obeys detailed balance . </S>",
    "<S> hence the markov chain constructed would converge asymptotically to the desired @xmath25-ensemble .    </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath26^{-1 } = \\exp(-\\beta e)$ ] we recover conventional boltzmann sampling , implemented in the metropolis algorithm . for any other choice of @xmath15 we get the corresponding non - boltzmann sampling . now </S>",
    "<S> , canonical ensemble average of a macroscopic property @xmath27 can be obtained by un - weighting and re - weighting of @xmath27 for each @xmath28 sampled from the @xmath25-ensemble . for un - weighting </S>",
    "<S> we divide by @xmath29^{-1}$ ] and for re - weighting we multiply by @xmath30 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the weight factor associated with a microstate @xmath28 belonging to the @xmath25-ensemble is thus , @xmath31 . \\label{weight_g}\\end{aligned}\\ </S>",
    "<S> ] ] we then have , @xmath32 the left hand side of the above is the equilibrium value of @xmath33 in a closed system at @xmath34 , while on the right side the summation in the numerator and in the denominator runs over microstates belonging to the non - boltzmann @xmath25-ensemble . </S>",
    "<S> it is also clear that from a single simulation of a @xmath25-ensemble , we can calculate the canonical average of @xmath33 at various temperatures .      </S>",
    "<S> entropic sampling obtains when @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> this choice of @xmath15 renders @xmath36 the same for all @xmath11 , see eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ g_ensemble ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the system does a simple random walk on a one dimensional energy space . </S>",
    "<S> hence all energy regions are visited with equal probability . as a result , in the case of first order phase transition for example , the microstates on the paths ( in the configurational space ) that connect ordered and disordered phases would get equally sampled . a crucial issue that remains to be clarified pertains to the observation that we do not know @xmath10 @xmath37 _ </S>",
    "<S> priori_.    in entropic sampling we employ a strategy to push @xmath15 closer and closer to @xmath10 , iteratively . </S>",
    "<S> we divide the range of energy into a large number of bins of equal widths . </S>",
    "<S> we denote the discrete - energy version of @xmath15 by the symbol @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> we start with @xmath39 ; the superscript is iteration run index and the subscript is energy bin index . </S>",
    "<S> the aim is to update @xmath40 from one iteration to the next : @xmath41 , so that asymptotically we get @xmath40 as close to @xmath42 as desired , where @xmath42 is the discrete energy representation of @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the iteration is carried out as follows . in the @xmath43 iteration , </S>",
    "<S> for example , we generate a large number of microstates employing acceptance probability based on @xmath44 and accumulate an histogram @xmath45 of energy of visited microstates . </S>",
    "<S> we update @xmath46 to @xmath47 , as given below , @xmath48 for all @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> the updated @xmath50 is employed in the next _ i.e. _ @xmath51 run , during which a fresh histogram of energy is generated . </S>",
    "<S> after each run , the histogram is examined for its uniformity . </S>",
    "<S> flatter the histogram , closer is @xmath52 to @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the calculated histogram serves two purposes in entropic sampling , one for updating @xmath52 and the other for monitoring the convergence of @xmath52 to @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is often neither practical nor necessary to get a strictly flat histogram ; an approximately flat histogram would be adequate , thanks to the un - weighting followed by reweighting with the boltzmann rule while calculating the averages , see eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ weight_g ] ,   [ re_weighting ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> hence the calculated macroscopic properties would come out right , even if @xmath52 does not converge strictly to @xmath54 .      </S>",
    "<S> a simple and flexible variant to entropic sampling was proposed recently by wang and landau @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the distinguishing feature of this algorithm is the dynamic evolution of the acceptance probability , @xmath23 ; we update @xmath52 after every monte carlo step . </S>",
    "<S> let us say the system visits a microstate in a monte carlo step and let the energy of the visited microstate fall in the @xmath55-th energy bin ; then @xmath56 is updated to @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the wang - landau factor , see below . </S>",
    "<S> the updated @xmath59 becomes operative immediately for determining the acceptance / rejection criteria of the very next trial microstate . </S>",
    "<S> we set @xmath60 for the zeroth run ; @xmath61 can be any number greater than unity ; the choice of @xmath62 has been originally recommended by wang and landau . </S>",
    "<S> we generate a large number of microstates employing the dynamically evolving @xmath23 . at the end of a run </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the histogram of energy of microstates visited by the system during the run . because of the continuous updating of @xmath23 , the energy span of the density of states increases significantly and the energy histogram serves to monitor the convergence of @xmath52 to @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> a run should be long enough to facilitate the system to span the energy over the desired range and to render the histogram of energy approximately flat . at the end of , say , the @xmath63-th run , the wang - landau factor for the next run </S>",
    "<S> is set as @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> after several runs , this factor would be very close to unity ; this implies that there would occur no significant change in @xmath40 during later runs . </S>",
    "<S> for example with the square - root rule and @xmath62 , we have @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that @xmath58 decreases monotonically with increase of the run index and reaches unity asymptotically . </S>",
    "<S> wang and landau have recommended the square - root rule @xcite ; any other rule consistent with the above properties of monotonicity and asymptotic convergence to unity should do equally well .    from the converged @xmath25 the desired macroscopic properties of the system </S>",
    "<S> can be calculated ; to this end we invoke the the connection between the density of states and microcanonical entropy , @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> thus the monte carlo estimate of microcanonical entropy is @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> for implementing such a scheme we need to normalize @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> the normalization constant should be obtained from known properties of the system . </S>",
    "<S> for example in ising model , the ground state is doubly degenerate : @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> the total number of microstates equals @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the number of ising spins in the monte carlo model : @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> either of these known information can be employed for normalizing @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> the normalized @xmath15 provides a good approximation to @xmath10 .    </S>",
    "<S> alternately , we can take the output @xmath40 from the above and carry out a single long non - boltzmann sampling run which generates microstates belonging to the @xmath25-ensemble . </S>",
    "<S> ( note that during the production run we do not update @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> by un - weighting and re - weighting of the microstates generated in the production run , we calculate the desired properties of the system as a function of @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> this is the strategy we shall follow for the simulation of liquid crystal system , described in the rest of the paper . in this strategy </S>",
    "<S> , we can employ arbitrary normalization of @xmath25 ; more importantly , it is adequate if    1 .   </S>",
    "<S> the system visits the energy region of interest and not necessarily the entire range and 2 .   </S>",
    "<S> the histogram of energy in the region of interest is approximately flat .    </S>",
    "<S> the usefulness of the wang - landau algorithm has been unambiguously demonstrated for systems with discrete energy spectrum </S>",
    "<S> . however , when we try to apply this technique to systems with continuous energy , there are serious difficulties . </S>",
    "<S> liquid crystalline materials with continuous energy spectrum provide such an example . </S>",
    "<S> in this paper we report simulation of a liquid crystalline system focusing attention on nematic - isotropic transition . </S>",
    "<S> the paper is organized as follows . in section </S>",
    "<S> ii , we describe a lattice model and hamiltonian of a liquid crystal system . </S>",
    "<S> we simulated the system with the conventional wang - landau algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the dynamics becomes extremely slow even for moderately large systems . </S>",
    "<S> the system gets stuck in certain regions of the configurational space . </S>",
    "<S> this problem appears to be generic to the algorithm when applied to continuous energy systems . </S>",
    "<S> hence we modify the wang - landau algorithm and the details of the simulation are given in section iii . </S>",
    "<S> the results on temperature variation of various macroscopic properties of the system are discussed in section iv . in section </S>",
    "<S> v we briefly summarize the work and highlight its salient features .    </S>",
    "<S> lattice model of bulk liquid crystals we consider an @xmath72 cubic lattice with each lattice site holding a three dimensional unit vector @xmath73 , called a spin . </S>",
    "<S> the elements of the vector are the direction cosines of a spin in a laboratory frame of reference . </S>",
    "<S> a spin represents notionally , a single uniaxial liquid crystal molecule or more realistically a cluster containing typically a hundred of them . </S>",
    "<S> the spins are actually headless in the sense the system has head - tail flip symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> two nearest neighbour spins interact with each other as per a potential proposed by lebwohl and lasher ( ll ) @xcite which has such a head - tail flip symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction energy is given by , @xmath74,\\label{eq_ll_potential}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are nearest neighbour lattice sites . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath77 is the angle between the two spins : @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction energy of a single nearest neighbour pair of spins ranges from a minimum of @xmath79 , when @xmath80 , or equivalently @xmath81 , to a maximum of @xmath82 , when @xmath83 or equivalently @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> total energy of the system in microstate @xmath2 is given by , @xmath85 where the sum runs over all distinct nearest neighbour pairs of lattice sites in the system taking into account the periodic boundary conditions in all the three directions . </S>",
    "<S> the total energy of the system thus varies continuously from a minimum of @xmath86 to a maximum of @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> when the system is completely ordered with all the spins aligned , the energy is minimum and equals @xmath86 ; the energy is zero for an isotropic ( completely disordered ) phase . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate several macroscopic properties of the liquid crystalline system and report here results which include orientational order parameter @xmath88 , average energy @xmath89 , specific heat ( at constant volume ) @xmath90 , and the binder s reduced fourth cumulant of energy @xmath91 .    </S>",
    "<S> first we employed conventional wang - landau algorithm and carried out monte carlo simulation of the lattice model of the liquid crystalline system . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the dynamics was extremely slow when the system size @xmath92 is @xmath93 and above . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated density of states @xmath15 becomes steeper with increase of monte carlo iterations . as a result </S>",
    "<S> the system gets stuck in certain narrow regions . </S>",
    "<S> there is practically no evolution of the calculated density of states @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> increasing the number of monte carlo steps in a wang - landau iteration does not seem to remedy the situation . instead , sharp peaks emerge and grow at either ends of @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> these problems appear to be generic to the wang - landau algorithm when applied to continuous energy systems . to overcome them , we experimented with several modifications @xcite of the algorithm and finally arrived at a strategy described in the next section .    </S>",
    "<S> modified wang - landau monte carlo simulation of bulk liquid crystal system free wheeling spins are placed on the vertices of a three dimensional cubic lattice with their orientations sampled randomly and independently . </S>",
    "<S> orientation of a spin is specified by the polar angle @xmath94 and an azimuthal angle @xmath95 with respect to a laboratory fixed three dimensional co - ordinate system . </S>",
    "<S> we sample @xmath96 from a uniform distribution between @xmath97 and @xmath98 , and the azimuthal angle @xmath95 from a uniform distribution between @xmath97 and @xmath99 . </S>",
    "<S> we divide the energy range @xmath100 into @xmath101 number bins of equal widths @xmath102 . </S>",
    "<S> we start with an array @xmath103 . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath104 denote the initial microstate constructed by placing spins with random and independent orientations at the lattice sites . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath105 fall in the @xmath106 energy bin . </S>",
    "<S> we select randomly a lattice site and make a random change in the orientation of the spin residing at that site . </S>",
    "<S> we employ barker s method @xcite to generate a new trial orientation from the current microstate . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath18 denote the trial microstate and let its energy belong to the @xmath63-th bin . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath107 , we accept the trial state and set @xmath108 ; if @xmath109 , we calculate the ratio @xmath110 . </S>",
    "<S> we select a random number @xmath111 ( uniformly distributed between @xmath97 to @xmath98 ) ; if @xmath112 we accept the trial microstate : @xmath108 . otherwise we reject @xmath18 and set @xmath113 . </S>",
    "<S> this constitutes a single move . </S>",
    "<S> we continue in the same fashion and get , @xmath114 . </S>",
    "<S> a set of @xmath115 moves constitutes a monte carlo sweep ( mcs ) . </S>",
    "<S> in the first mcs , since @xmath116 is the same for all @xmath75 , every move gets accepted .    at the end of the mcs , </S>",
    "<S> let us say the system is in microstate @xmath117 . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath118 belong to the @xmath119-th energy bin . </S>",
    "<S> we update @xmath120 to @xmath121 , where @xmath60 . the updated @xmath52 becomes operative for deciding acceptance / rejection in the next @xmath115 moves that constitute the next mcs leading to @xmath122 . </S>",
    "<S> thus we get a chain of microstates @xmath123 . </S>",

    "<S> constitutes one iteration . for the next iteration we change @xmath58 to @xmath126 . </S>",

    "<S> we can estimate the @xmath164 limit of the transition temperature by finite size scaling discussed later .    </S>",
    "<S> the variation of average energy @xmath89 with temperature is depicted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fig_energy ] ) . </S>",

    "<S> increasing the number of sweeps in an iteration does not seem to help . </S>",
    "<S> this slowing down of dynamics seems to be an inherent problem of this algorithm for such systems . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly such problems do not arise for simulating systems with discrete energy spectrum _ </S>",
    "<S> e.g. _ ising and potts spin models . to overcome these problems , </S>",
    "<S> we have proposed a few modifications to the wang - landau algorithm and demonstrated that these modifications help the basic algorithm to span larger regions of the energy space systematically . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the macroscopic properties bulk liquid crystalline system can be calculated with a good degree of accuracy and with vastly improved temperature resolution . </S>",
