    "models in which there are new particles that are either themselves invisible , or that decay to invisible or nearly invisible final states , abound in particle physics .",
    "for example , one of the most popular and attractive models for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) is supersymmetry ( susy ) .",
    "the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp , normally the lightest neutralino , @xmath5 ) of susy is invisible under the usual assumption of @xmath6-parity conservation .",
    "other ( heavier ) supersymmetric partners of known particles ( the sparticles ) are usually easily detectable at lep2 and the next linear @xmath7 collider ( nlc ) via events with energetic jets and/or leptons and missing energy , when the fraction of energy carried by the lsp and neutrinos in sparticle decays is not too large .",
    "this is the case for the most popular model scenarios .",
    "however , as outlined later , there exist susy models in which potentially visible jets / leptons from decays of many and perhaps all the lower - mass sparticles are either altogether absent or very to extremely soft . a heavy lepton doublet @xmath8 where the @xmath9 is stable in the detector and @xmath10 is very small so that the @xmath11 from the @xmath12 decay is very soft provides another physics scenario which could be missed without employing a special approach @xcite",
    ". scenarios with extra scalar bosons have been proposed in which some are invisible because of degeneracy @xcite .",
    "it is thus a matter of some urgency to explore techniques , and to specify the required detector characteristics , that will maximize our ability to detect invisible or ` nearly invisible ' particles ( denoted by ip and nip , respectively ) _ and to determine their mass_. if more than one ip and/or nip is present , the techniques we discuss could allow for separation of the different signals and individual determination of masses , depending upon statistics .    even if a nip decays to visible , but soft , particles , triggering on inclusive nip pair production is problematical .",
    "typically , the mass difference between the nip and its invisible decay products must be @xmath13 @xcite for inclusive pair production to be detectable in the presence of backgrounds . for very small mass differences , the nip would develop a long enough lifetime that , if it is charged , a short track in the vertex detector might be visible ; the problem would be to trigger on the event .",
    "further , even if isolation of signal events at the inclusive level is possible , it could be very difficult to determine the mass of the particles being produced via the usual spectrum endpoint procedures .",
    "the possible solution to all these problems is to require that a tagged photon be produced in association with large missing energy from the pair of ip s or nip s .",
    "this is an idea that originated for counting neutrinos @xcite , and has since been employed for a number of entirely invisible susy sparticles , see for example refs .",
    "@xcite . in this paper",
    "we emphasize photon tagging in the nip context .",
    "we focus particularly on some previously unexplored scenarios in which the lightest chargino could be nearly invisible . a common assumption regarding supersymmetry breaking",
    "is that the gaugino masses are universal at the gut scale , @xmath14 .",
    "the renormalization group equations then imply that the gaugino masses at scales below a tev are roughly related by @xmath15 and @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the gluino mass and @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the @xmath20 and @xmath21 gaugino masses .",
    "since the @xmath22 parameter that also enters the chargino and neutralino mass matrices is typically large , the above relations imply that the @xmath5 lsp is mainly of the @xmath21 bino variety with mass of order @xmath19 and the lightest chargino , @xmath23 , is primarily a wino with mass of order @xmath18 .",
    "this implies significant mass splitting @xmath24 , so that observation of @xmath25 production in @xmath7 collisions is straightforward @xcite .",
    "however , it is not impossible that the @xmath14 boundary conditions are quite different and that @xmath26 could be small , perhaps _ very _ small .",
    "a small mass difference arises , in particular , in two cases :    ( i ) : :    high-@xmath22 scenario : if @xmath18 is substantially smaller than    @xmath19 , and @xmath27 then the    @xmath5 and @xmath23 are both wino - like and    closely degenerate with @xmath28 .",
    "( ii ) : :    low-@xmath22 , large-@xmath29 scenario : if    @xmath30 , then @xmath5 ,    @xmath31 and @xmath23 are all higgsino - like    and nearly degenerate with masses @xmath32 .",
    "values of @xmath33 (  in the problematical region for normal inclusive detection ) are not at all improbable in either scenario , being almost automatic in scenario ( i ) and requiring only @xmath34 in scenario ( ii ) ( well within the natural range for supersymmetry breaking )",
    ".    the most challenging situation arises if @xmath26 lies below about a gev , since then the visibility of the @xmath35 comes into question . in case ( ii ) , @xmath36 implies that @xmath37 and @xmath38 will then more or less automatically also be of order a gev or less ; in contrast , in case ( i ) @xmath39 is typically significantly larger than @xmath40 .",
    "extreme degeneracy ( @xmath36 ) between the lightest chargino and the lsp can be achieved in case ( i ) for @xmath41 if @xmath42 , whereas in case ( ii ) @xmath29 must be @xmath43 if @xmath44 .",
    "( values of @xmath45 below @xmath46 are excluded by lep1 limits on invisible / extra @xmath47 decays @xcite . ) thus , only scenario ( i ) can remain technically natural for @xmath36 , but from an experimental perspective scenario ( ii ) also deserves exploration in this limit .    in this paper , we show that @xmath48 ( and , in scenario ( ii ) , @xmath49 ) can yield a viable signal at lep2 and the nlc for the mass - degenerate scenarios in question , depending upon the value of the common mass ( denoted @xmath50 ) .",
    "if the soft secondary tracks from @xmath35 decay are visible ( with substantial efficiency ) then events containing a hard photon and the visible @xmath35 remnants occur at a reasonable rate so long as @xmath50 is not too close to the threshold allowed by the required photon cut . if the @xmath35 are effectively invisible , events of the type @xmath51 will be adequately enhanced ( for appropriate cuts ) over standard model ( sm ) expectations as to provide the required signal for @xmath50 up to somewhat lower values .",
    "whenever a signal is visible , at least an approximate determination of @xmath50 will be possible .",
    "we will begin by focusing on the case in which the light inos are effectively invisible so that the final state is @xmath52 . in practice ,",
    "the only important signal processes are    1 .",
    "@xmath53 ; and , in scenario ( ii ) , 2 .   @xmath54 .",
    "+ the only irreducible background is 3 .",
    "@xmath55 .    in both scenarios ( i ) and",
    "( ii ) the @xmath56 and @xmath57 couplings are small , implying that @xmath58 and @xmath59 final states have negligible rate . however , in scenario ( ii ) the @xmath60 coupling is maximal and reaction ( 2 ) is important . the background from @xmath61 in which _ both _ @xmath62 s decay to leptons or hadrons with small energy ( say below a few gev or so ) , or disappear down the beam pipe , is negligible by comparison to reaction ( 3 ) . a second , potentially very large",
    ", background is that from @xmath63 events where neither the final @xmath0 nor @xmath1 is detected .",
    "the techniques and experimental requirements for eliminating this background are discussed below . in our computations of the signal cross sections , we assume that slepton and sneutrino exchange diagrams can be neglected . in scenario ( ii ) , this is automatically the case because the higgsino - like @xmath64 have negligible coupling to @xmath65 . as described in ref .",
    "@xcite , the specific string model approach that leads to scenario ( i ) requires a large @xmath14-scale value of the soft supersymmetry breaking scalar mass parameter @xmath66 , implying that most sfermions ( except possibly the lightest stop ) have masses @xmath67 , so that slepton and sneutrino exchanges can again be neglected .",
    "note that squarks , sleptons and sneutrinos would then all be too heavy to be directly produced at the nlc , let alone lep2 .",
    "the only observable signals for susy at @xmath7 colliders would be those we now discuss .",
    "we envision tagging the events using a photon that has substantial transverse momentum . for the study presented here",
    ", we require @xmath68 , with @xmath69 , and @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the angle of the photon with respect to the beam axis , so as to guarantee that the photon enters a typical detector and will have an accurately measured momentum .",
    "we define @xmath52 events by requiring that any other particle appearing in the @xmath72 to @xmath73 angular range must have energy less than @xmath74 , where @xmath74 is detector - dependent , but presumably no larger than a few gev .",
    "kinematics can be used to show that we can eliminate the @xmath75 background by vetoing events containing an @xmath0 or @xmath1 with @xmath76 with angle @xmath77 with respect to either beam axis , or with @xmath78 and @xmath79 , _ provided _",
    "@xmath80 ( assuming @xmath74 is not larger than a few gev ) . for @xmath69 ,",
    "this means that we must instrument the beam hole down to @xmath81 .",
    "in fact , instrumentation and vetoing will be possible down to @xmath82 @xcite , implying that @xmath83 could be lowered to @xmath84 without contamination from the @xmath75 background . at lep-192 , beam hole coverage down to about @xmath85",
    "is needed when using a @xmath69 cut .    for ino masses above @xmath46 , the key observation for reducing the background reaction ( 3 ) and determining",
    "the ino mass is to note that the missing mass @xmath86^{1/2}$ ] can be very accurately reconstructed . for signals with good overall statistical significance ( in most cases @xmath87 , defined below",
    ", @xmath88 is adequate ) one can plot events as a function of @xmath89 and look for the threshold at @xmath90 at which the spectrum starts to exceed the expectations from @xmath91 .",
    "we define an overall statistical significance @xmath92 for the signal by summing over all events with @xmath93 .",
    "note , in particular , that this cut eliminates the @xmath47-pole contribution to the @xmath91 background for @xmath94 . in practice",
    ", one can often do better ( perhaps by @xmath95 ) than this nominal @xmath87 value by zeroing in on those @xmath89 bins with the largest deviations from @xmath91 expectations .    in fig .",
    "[ eetogaminv ] we display our results . for scenario ( i ) , the @xmath53 signal and @xmath96 background cross sections are such as to yield ( solid curves ) @xmath97 for @xmath98 ( @xmath99 ) at lep-192 ( nlc-500 ) for total luminosities of @xmath100 ( @xmath101 ) , respectively . in contrast , for universal gaugino masses at @xmath14 it is generally expected that chargino pair production can be observed up to very nearly @xmath102 .",
    "we note that the nominal @xmath103 signal observation requires a small systematic uncertainty in our knowledge of the background , given that @xmath104 ( @xmath105 ) at the @xmath50 value at lep-192 ( nlc-500 ) where @xmath87 falls below 5 .",
    "thus , it could be that the @xmath52 signal might not be viable all the way out to the nominal @xmath103 mass value .    in scenario ( ii ) , the @xmath5 , @xmath35 _ and _ @xmath31 are all closely degenerate . in this case",
    ", the magnitude of the @xmath52 signal depends upon whether or not we include @xmath54 as a contribution .",
    "we will present @xmath87 values obtained for the @xmath106 and @xmath107 channels separately , keeping in mind that the mass degeneracy means that in the @xmath52 channel they can be added together . from the results presented in fig .",
    "[ eetogaminv ] we see that the @xmath52 signal from the @xmath106 channel alone is much weaker in this scenario where the @xmath35 are higgsino - like as compared to the previous scenario where they are @xmath20-gaugino - like .",
    "this is simply because the virtual @xmath47-exchange contribution is suppressed when the @xmath35 are higgsino - like ( and thus belong to a doublet vs. triplet su(2 ) representation ) . without including the @xmath107 channel lep-192 ( nlc-500 )",
    "can only achieve @xmath108 for @xmath109 ( @xmath110 ) .",
    "for the combined @xmath111 channels lep-192 ( nlc-500 ) can achieve @xmath108 for @xmath112 ( @xmath113 ) , better , but still not as large a reach as for scenario ( i ) .    by way of comparison",
    ", we also give results ( dot - dashed curves ) for the @xmath52 signal deriving from @xmath114 when the @xmath115 decays invisibly to @xmath116 with 100% branching ratio .",
    "@xmath117 is typical of soft - susy - breaking models having @xmath118 ( the common gaugino mass ) substantially larger than @xmath66 ( the common scalar mass ) at @xmath14 ; an example is the very attractive dilaton model with @xmath119 @xcite .",
    "detection of invisible sneutrinos in association with a photon tag was also considered in ref .",
    "@xcite ; there , several other model contexts in which @xmath120 or is large are reviewed .",
    "our procedures differ from those of ref .",
    "@xcite in that we employ the @xmath121 cut to maximize the signal significance .",
    "we conservatively compute the signal in the approximation that charginos are heavy .",
    "we see from fig .",
    "[ eetogaminv ] that a statistically significant signal ( @xmath122 ) is not possible at lep-192 for integrated luminosity of @xmath100 , whereas @xmath123 could be probed at the nlc with @xmath124 .",

    "@xcite at lep-192 are also well below the @xmath122 level . )",
    "finally , we note that in these models the lighter @xmath125 eigenstate , @xmath126 , can be nearly degenerate with the @xmath5 ( the crossover at @xmath127 often defines the upper limit on @xmath128 ) in which case @xmath129 production would provide the only viable signature for the @xmath126 .",
    "for all the cases discussed above , we have explored whether increasing the minimum @xmath130 required at a given @xmath50 or @xmath131 would improve @xmath87 . even though @xmath132 can be improved at lower masses",
    ", the nominal @xmath87 worsens in all the cases examined .",
    "we also find that the distributions of signal and background in @xmath71 are very similar ( even in the @xmath133 case ) so that additional @xmath71 cuts do not help .",
    "the more limited range of viability for the @xmath52 signals in scenario ( ii ) is a concern .",
    "however , for @xmath29 values below a @xmath134 ( but @xmath22 still much smaller ) , the degeneracy among the @xmath135 will be only approximate and the leptons from @xmath136 or the photon from the one - loop decay @xmath137 ( the decays @xmath138 and @xmath139 usually having much smaller branching ratio ) would generally be visible .",
    "this leads us to consider the case in which the @xmath35 and @xmath31 decay visibly , but the mass degeneracy is such that the visible decay products are quite soft .",
    "once again , the hard photon trigger will be crucial .",
    "we have been unable to envision significant backgrounds to the types of events in question ( assuming the @xmath75 events are vetoed , as described earlier ) . in scenario ( i )",
    "the signal events would contain a hard photon , large missing energy , and either two widely separated quasi - stable particle tracks , if the @xmath23 has a long lifetime , or separated soft leptons , pions and/or jets . in scenario ( ii )",
    ", the @xmath107 events would have a single extra soft isolated photon from the dominant @xmath137 decay .",
    "( note that it would be possible to separate @xmath25 from @xmath140 events . ) if the backgrounds to these two types of @xmath141 are truly negligible , then it is the absolute rate obtained by combining all such events that determines whether or not the events provide a viable signal .",

    "the cross sections of fig .",
    "[ eetogaminv ] give event rates that are sizeable for chargino masses substantially above the values that can be probed by the @xmath52 signal . for our cuts , we find about 25 ( 50 ) events at @xmath142 ( @xmath143 ) at lep-192 with @xmath100 ( nlc-500 with @xmath124 ) . with good efficiency",
    "either for detecting the @xmath35 as quasi - stable particle tracks in the vertex detector or for detecting the @xmath35 decay products (  the soft pions , leptons or jets ) , these event numbers may be adequate .",

    "these small numbers would appear to be quite marginal ; probably one would be able to extract the signal obtained by combining the @xmath106 and @xmath107 events only for masses @xmath145 ( @xmath146 ) at lep-192 ( nlc-500 ) . a @xmath103 determination of the two signal levels separately would be possible only for a still more limited mass range .",
    "in this section , we quantify the extent to which the lightest chargino might or might not be visible . we have computed the branching ratios and lifetimes for the @xmath148 . in fig .",
    "[ lifebrs ] , we give explicit results for the ( more natural ) large-@xmath22 scenario ( i ) .",

    "details of the calculations will appear in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we simply note that the lifetime and branching ratios are essentially independent of @xmath128 and the sign of the @xmath22 parameter .",
    "finally , we note that scenario ( ii ) leads to very similar @xmath148 branching ratios , but , for a given @xmath26 , about a 40% longer lifetime . and",
    ", we have already noted that in scenario ( ii ) the dominant @xmath31 decay is via one - loop graphs to @xmath157 for small mass differences .",
    "let us now consider implications for @xmath106 production .",
    "[ lifebrs](a ) shows that the produced @xmath148 and @xmath23 will travel distances of order a meter or more ( and thus appear as heavily - ionizing tracks in the vertex detector and the main detector ) if @xmath158 . for @xmath159 , @xmath160 m . for @xmath161 near 10 cm , the @xmath35 would pass through enough layers of a typical vertex detector that its heavily ionizing nature would be apparent . for @xmath161 in the smaller end of the above range , one would have to look for the single charged pion from the dominant @xmath162 mode .",
    "it emerges at a finite distance of order @xmath161 from the vertex and would have momentum @xmath163 in the @xmath35 rest frame .",
    "the expected impact parameter resolution , @xmath164 , of a typical vertex detector ( we looked at the cdf run ii vertex detector with the inner l00 layer in detail   cm , implying less sensitivity there . ] ) as a function of momentum is such that @xmath165 for @xmath166 , with quite large values typical for @xmath167 .",
    "such a high-@xmath168 pion in association with the @xmath169 trigger would constitute a fairly distinctive signal .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , detection of any heavily - ionizing track and/or _ any _ @xmath35 decay product would greatly enhance the significance of the signal by removing the @xmath91 background .",
    "for @xmath170 , the @xmath35 decay is prompt and one must look for the soft leptons or hadrons emerging from the decay .",
    "these might be difficult to detect if @xmath26 is not somewhat larger .",
    "for instance , for @xmath171 , @xmath35 decays lead to final states that are similar to those appearing in @xmath172 decays . without the hard photon plus @xmath173 tag , backgrounds to inclusive @xmath174 from @xmath175",
    "might be difficult to overcome , even if the chargino pair events can be triggered on .",
    "we have considered techniques for detecting particles that decay invisibly or nearly invisibly at @xmath7 colliders , focusing on the implications for chargino detection of scenarios in which @xmath24 is small , including cases in which @xmath26 is neither small enough for the @xmath35 to produce a visible track in the detector nor large enough for the leptons from @xmath176 to have adequate momentum to be visible .",
    "we have demonstrated that if the @xmath35 are effectively invisible , then @xmath51 events with @xmath177 will be detectable above the @xmath178 background for a substantial ( but model - dependent ) range of @xmath179 .    in order that @xmath178 be the primary background in the @xmath52 channel , @xmath75 events for which a fast final @xmath0 and @xmath1 are not seen must be vetoed . at the nlc , for example , this implies that it is absolutely mandatory ( and , apparently , straightforward ) for the detectors to have instrumentation in the @xmath180 to @xmath72 portion of the beam hole , where @xmath181 for @xmath69 .",
    "we have delineated the lifetime and branching ratios of the @xmath35 .",
    "these can be used to determine the detector requirements and machine environment that would alleviate the necessity for employing the rather indirect @xmath52 signal for supersymmetry .",
    "the hope is that one could observe the @xmath106 events by tagging the photon , requiring large @xmath173 and looking , in addition , for the ` quasi - stable ' particle tracks and/or the soft leptons or charged pions from the @xmath35 decays .",
    "we urge the detector groups at lep and planning groups for the nlc to examine carefully the question of whether or not there is a band in @xmath26 for which only the @xmath52 signature ( with the large @xmath91 background ) can be employed . if tracks or remnants from the @xmath35 are visible with good efficiency , we find that the predicted rates for @xmath141 events are such as to yield a viable @xmath106 signal for @xmath179 substantially nearer to the kinematic limit implied by the photon trigger requirement than if only the @xmath52 signature can be employed . in scenario ( ii ) , similar statements apply to @xmath54 events , where the soft leptons / pions are replaced by a single soft photon .",
    "we stress that the @xmath52 and @xmath141 procedures are broadly applicable to isolating a signal for invisible and nearly invisible particles .",
    "the photon trigger also provides a general , and , quite possibly , the only , means for determining the mass of any such particle .",
    "mass determination is accomplished by employing @xmath86^{1/2}$ ] to look for the onset of signal events at @xmath89 equal to twice the mass of the particle in question . with good statistics , detection of several distinct @xmath89 thresholds",
    "can potentially be used to separate signals appearing at different mass scales due to different particles even when the associated events are indistinguishable on the basis of event characteristics .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we explore tevatron and lhc detection of gluinos when @xmath182 is near @xmath183 . despite the softness of the jets in @xmath184 decays and the invisibility of the @xmath35 decay products , we find that detection of gluino pair events in @xmath185 final states will still be possible for much the same mass ranges as before .",
    "this is because gluino pairs have a high probability of being made in association with one or more energetic jets .",
