    "the expectations for a new physics at the energy scale of hundreds of gev are high . to some extent , the current status of sm is reminiscent to that of weak interactions in early 70th just before the discovery of @xmath1-meson and @xmath2-quark . at that time",

    "the negative results of these searches have found a quite natural explanation in frame of cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) quark mixing matrix phenomenology with a single nonzero phase that makes this matrix complex  @xcite . at present time , the ckm - matrix formalism is _ de facto _ the common language for sm interpretation of all already discovered -violating phenomena . at the currently achieved level of experimental and theoretical uncertainties ,",
    "no clear contradictions had been found of the relations between few measured -odd parameters and the constrains of ckm - matrix .",

    "plans for -violation studies are in the research programs of all particle physics accelerator laboratories around the world , not mentioning _",
    "b_-factories proposed almost exclusively with the -violation in mind .",
    "not undermining in any way the indisputable significance of the recent -activity , it should be underlined that its efforts are focused mainly on testing the ckm - based sm predictions for `` direct '' -violation in @xmath7-decays as well as large -violation in @xmath8-quark transformations .",
    "meanwhile , there is a quite widespread dissatisfaction and disbelief  @xcite that a single nonzero phase in ckm - matrix may be the only emergence of -violation in foreseeable energy range , and there are good reasons for such a discomfort .",
    "for example , various approaches to understanding the baryon asymmetry of the universe require much stronger -violation than it is suggested in the minimal ckm - based sm  @xcite . in many models , -odd effects ,",
    "sufficiently large for being detectable at high energy colliders , could be generated  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , as it had been pointed out just a few years ago  @xcite : _ `` at present time published limits do not exist for the size of most cp - violating processes at 100  gev scale .",

    "most publications are focused on unpolarized colliders where the detection of - and/or -violation requires to carry out quite difficult measurements of either fine balances between particle and antiparticle production in -conjugate processes , or polarizations of final jets to detect potentially nonzero -odd correlations .",
    "recently , some indications of the jet handedness correlations in @xmath12-decays , which were of the opposite sign to that expected in sm , had been reported  @xcite .",
    "the authors looked into the jet fragmentation mechanisms for a possible explanation .",
    "alternatively , a presence of a tensor @xmath13-coupling may also be responsible for the wrong sign correlations .    in the collisions of polarized particles , the number of potentially interesting -odd as well as -even correlations and [ sec : discussion ] for examples ) .",

    ". a new physics and /-violation mechanism behind these correlations could virtually be anywhere and everywhere  @xcite : in qcd quark - gluon and gluon - gluon coupling ; in electroweak interactions mediated by the usual vector bosons as well as by suggested in some theories @xmath14 and @xmath15 of higher masses ; in higgs sector ; in the leptoquark exchange ; due to spontaneous /-violation ; etc .",
    "however , an observation of a nonzero -odd correlation may never be treated by itself as an evidence of - or -violation because these correlations are easily generated by purely - and -even initial and final state interactions .",

    "nevertheless , even in high energy hard collisions , a comparison of asymmetries in -conjugate processes is still required for a conclusion on unambiguous and model independent observation of -violation , i.e. the same problem as in the measurements of balances between particle and antiparticle productions needs to be solved .    with all similarities ,",
    "there is one important difference between comparisons of production cross sections and spin dependent asymmetries in -conjugate processes . in the case of cross sections",

    "therefore , unaccounted differences of these scales in -conjugate processes do not introduce systematic errors to the asymmetry comparison .",
    "it is also worth noticing that , in the cases of small background ( spurious ) asymmetries , just `` wrong '' relative signs of detected asymmetries in -conjugate processes would be a sufficient evidence for -violation . and",
    "the last not the least , most reasonable models with -violation quite easily generate -odd spin dependent asymmetries , while measurements of cross section differences , averaged over initial and final polarizations , are often not sensitive to -violating amplitudes",
    ". the number of asymmetries to test would be particularly large if both transversely and longitudinally polarized projectiles were available .    unlike in the accelerator experiments focused on decays of secondaries ,",
    "the primary collisions and incident polarized particles themselves are parts of the reactions under investigation in the measurements of spin dependent asymmetries .",
    "therefore , for having such experiments on -violation to be conclusive , an availability of -conjugate initial states is a must . from this point of view , @xmath9-colliders with two polarized beams  @xcite would clearly be among the best and the most capable machines . in polarized @xmath9 collision , all variety of quark - antiquark , quark - gluon , and gluon - gluon interactions in -conjugate processes could be tested .",
    "complimentary , polarized @xmath17- and @xmath18-colliders could be used for studying /-violation in the neutral current lepton scattering and annihilation , and at the energies above the threshold of @xmath3-pair production , the /-invariance of charged current interactions could also be checked .",
    "unfortunately , neither of these colliders with two polarized beams is currently available .",
    "meanwhile , the -asymmetric collisions of two polarized proton beams are expected to be seen soon at rhic in bnl  @xcite , pursuing the goal to comprehensively explore the proton spin structure  @xcite as well as carry out a wide range study of parity violating phenomena in @xmath19- and @xmath12-boson productions and decays  @xcite .",
    "although being obviously not the best for -invariance tests , collisions of two high energy polarized protons still have capabilities for , at minimum , scouting the problem in the processes with a reasonably clear picture of underlining parton interactions .",
    "at rhic , the processes of hadronic leptoproduction via photon , @xmath19- , and @xmath12-boson exchange ,    @xmath20 will probably be the cleanest ones to search for - and/or -violation and other unusual and unexpected phenomena in .    in the rest of this paper , few examples of measurable asymmetries for processes  ( [ eq : qq_wz_ll ] )",

    "however , to distinguish -odd and -even correlations by comparing asymmetries in -conjugate processes , at least the relative signs of polarizations and often the directions of motions of the primary hardly collided quark and antiquark need to be known .",

    ", strong enough indications may potentially emerge if , for example , several asymmetries have been detected in the same process and , with either assumption about the spin structure of proton , one part of these asymmetries behaved as a -even under -conjugation , and the other part as a -odd , and vice versa . in the situations like this , it might probably not be so easy to reconcile -conservation with the current quark - parton picture of gauge boson hadroproduction .",
