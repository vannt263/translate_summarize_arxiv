    "ehrhardt _ et al _ ( 1969 ) @xcite were the first to conduct electron impact ionization experiments in which the two outgoing electrons are detected in coincidence after angular and energy analysis .",
    "the first theoreticians who proposed such type of experiment were smirnov and neudachin ( 1966 ) @xcite .",
    "these experiments now are commonly referred to as @xmath0 . since then , the @xmath0 reaction has been studied extensively in the non relativistic kinematic domain ( camilloni _ et al _ 1972 @xcite , weigold _ et al _",
    "1973 @xcite , van der wiel 1973 @xcite , brion 1975 @xcite ) .",
    "all these studies show that the non relativistic ( e,2e ) reaction is a very sensitive test of the target electronic structure and the electron impact ionization reaction mechanism . for the relativistic domain , the first electron impact ionization experiments where conducted by dangerfield and spicer ( 1975 ) @xcite , then by hoffman _",
    "et al _ ( 1979 ) @xcite and by anholt ( 1979 ) @xcite .",
    "total cross sections with relativistic electrons where measured for the k and l shells of heavy elements .",
    "some theoreticians ( scoffield 1978 @xcite , moiseiwitsch and stockman @xcite ) proposed models for total ionization cross sections . finally , fuss _",
    "et al _ ( 1982 ) @xcite proposed a model of an @xmath0 reaction they called binary @xmath0 reaction in which the maximum momentum transfer occurs , that is , a reaction where the outgoing electrons have equal energy .",
    "this type of reaction has been since then the most successful for probing atomic , molecular and solid state structure . in a report devoted both to experimental and theoretical developments in the study of relativistic @xmath0 processes , nakel and whelan ( 1999 )",
    "@xcite reviewed the goals of these investigations aimed at gaining a better understanding of inner - shell ionization process by relativistic electrons up to the highest atomic numbers and probing the quantum mechanical coulomb problem in the regime of high energies ( up to 500 kev ) and strong fields . with the advent of the laser field , many theoretical models have been proposed @xcite mainly in the non relativistic domain whereas in the relativistic domain we can only quote the work of reiss ( 1990 ) @xcite and that of crawford and reiss ( 1994,1998 ) @xcite who studied the relativistic ionization of hydrogen ( without electron impact ) by linearly polarized light .",
    "they focused their work on the calculations of the differential transition rates and have shown that strong field atomic stabilization is enhanced by relativistic effects .    in this article , we present a theoretical model for the relativistic electronic dressing in laser - assisted ionization of atomic hydrogen by electron impact with a circularly polarized laser field and in order to check the consistency of our calculations , we begin our study in absence of the laser field . as we devote this analysis to atomic hydrogen , all distorsion effects mentioned in @xcite",
    "need not be addressed since the atomic number we deal with is that of atomic hydrogen , that is @xmath1 .",
    "it is checked first that , in the absence of the laser field and working in the coplanar binary geometry where the kinetic energies of the scattered electron and the ejected electron are nearly the same , it is justified to use plane wave solutions for the study of the @xmath0 reaction .",
    "indeed , this particular geometry is such that the ejected electron does not feel the coulomb influence of atomic target and can be described by a plane wave in the non relativistic as well as in the relativistic domain . then , in the presence of a circularly polarized laser field , we introduce as a first step the dvrpwba1 ( dirac - volkov plane wave born approximation1 ) where we take into account only the relativistic dressing of the incident and scattered electrons .",
    "it is shown that this approximation introduces an asymmetry in the description of the scattering process since it does not allow photon exchange between the laser field and the ejected electron and its domain of validity is only restricted to very weak fields and non relativistic electron kinetic energy .",
    "then , we introduce the dvrpwba2 ( dirac - volkov plane wave born approximation2 ) where we take totally into account the relativistic dressing of the incident , scattered and ejected electrons .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : in section ii , we present the relativistic formalism of @xmath0 reaction in absence of the laser field rpwba ( relativistic plane wave born approximation ) and we compare it in the non relativistic domain with the nrpwba ( non relativistic plane wave born approximation ) as well as the nrcba ( non relativistic coulomb - born approximation ) . in section iii , we introduce the dvpwba1 ( dirac - volkov plane wave born approximation1 ) .",
    "this approximation is introduced as a first step . in section iv",
    ", we introduce the dvpwba2 ( dirac - volkov plane wave born approximation2 ) in which we take fully account of the relativistic electronic dressing of the incident , scattered and ejected electrons .",
    "this approximation is more founded on physical grounds since the ejected electron can also exchange photons ( absorption or emission ) with the laser field .",
    "this more complete description of the incoming and outgoing electrons allows to investigate the relativistic domain . in section v , we discuss the results we have obtained and we end by a brief conclusion in section vi . throughout this work , atomic units ( a.u )",
    "are used ( @xmath2 ) where @xmath3 is the electron mass and tdcs stands for triple differential cross section .",
    "the transition matrix element for the direct channel ( we neglect exchange effects ) is given by    @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the direct interaction potential ( @xmath6 ) and in the rpwba , @xmath7 is the wave function describing the scattered electron    @xmath8    given by a free dirac solution normalized to the volume @xmath9 . for the incident electron ,",

    "we compare this tdcs with the corresponding cross sections in the framework of the nrpwba2 ( where the incident , scattered and ejected electrons are described by non relativistic volkov plane waves )",
    "we begin our discussion by the kinematics of the problem . in absence of the laser field",
    ", there is no dressing of angular coordinates @xcite and we choose a geometry where @xmath89 is along the @xmath90 axis ( @xmath91 ) . for the scattered electron ,",
    "we choose ( @xmath92 @xmath93 ) and for the ejected electron we choose @xmath94 and the angle @xmath95 varies from @xmath96 to @xmath97 .",
    "this is an angular situation where we have a coplanar geometry .",
    "spin effects are fully included and we use an exact relativistic description of the electrons and the atomic target . in order to check the validity of the coplanar binary geometry , we begin first by comparing the three tdcss ( rpwba , nrpwba and nrcba ) in the non relativistic domain . in the expression of the fourier",

    "the solid line represents the non relativistic tdcs in the coulomb born approximation the long dashed line represents the corresponding tdcs in the plane wave approximation and the dotted line sketches the relativistic tdcs in the plane wave approximation .",
    "the incident electron kinetic energy is @xmath108 and the ejected electron kinetic energy is @xmath109 , width=321,height=245 ]      in fig 1 , we see that both rpwba and nrpwba give nearly the same results whereas nrcba gives a higher tdcs due to the fact that the ejected electron still feels the influence of the atomic field . increasing this energy of the ejected electron from @xmath110 @xmath105 to @xmath111 @xmath105",
    "gives rise to almost three indistinguishable curves .",
    "this situation is shown in fig 2 .",
    "as the incident electron kinetic energy is increased to @xmath113 @xmath105 which corresponds to a relativistic parameter @xmath114 , that of the ejected electron to @xmath115 @xmath105 , we have a very good agreement between the three tdcss .",
    "this is a crucial test for the models we will develop in the presence of a laser field since the adjunction of the latter can not be done without a judicious choice of a geometry .",
    "it must be borne in mind that this coplanar binary geometry is not well suited for the study of the domain of low kinetic energy for the ejected electron .",
    "the agreement between these three approaches remains good up to @xmath116 @xmath117 from which the rpwba gives results that are a little lower than nrpwba and nrcba because relativistic and spin effects can no longer be ignored . due to the relative simplicity of the model (",
    "even if the calculations are far from being obvious ) and the exact non dressed relativistic description of the target , it is remarkable that such an agreement should be reached for these energies . when the laser field is introduced , the dressing of angular coordinates is not important for the non relativistic regime ( @xmath118 , @xmath119 @xmath120 but becomes noticeable for the relativistic regime ( @xmath121 , @xmath122 @xmath107 ) where @xmath123 is the electric field strength .",
    "the unit of electric field strength in atomic units is @xmath124 @xmath125 @xmath126 .",

    "we have done these checks for all approximations .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that for a laser frequency @xmath127 @xmath107 , which corresponds to a laser photon energy of @xmath128 @xmath105 , dressing effects due to the atomic target are not very important .",
    "a complete and exact relativistic treatment of the ejected electron is not analytically possible since the non relativistic wave equation for continuum states in a coulomb field is separable in parabolic coordinates , but the corresponding dirac equation is not .",
    "in other words , a decomposition of the relativistic continuum wave function into partial waves is not as straightforward as for the non relativistic case and the quantum numbers of each partial wave have to be taken into account very carefully .",
    "however , a tedious numerical construction of the first few partial waves is possible .",
    "we first compare the results obtained within the three approximations ( dvpwba1 , nrpwba1 , nrcba1 ) where it is expected on physical grounds that these can not be used to study the relativistic regime .",
    "the three summed tdcss are all peaked around @xmath129 , @xmath130 which was to be expected for the case of the geometry chosen since for the scattered electron , the choice we have made is @xmath131 , @xmath132 and in the @xmath133 plane , this amounts to a scattered electron and an ejected electron having an opposite value of @xmath134 .",
    "even with no photon exchange and for an electric field stregth of @xmath135 @xmath107 , the presence of the laser field reduces considerably the magnitude of the tdcss .",

    "two interesting cases are those corresponding to the absorption and emission of one photon .",
    "we have shown in a previous work @xcite that when all electrons are described by dirac - volkov planes , the corresponding differential cross sections for the absorption and emission ( of one photon ) processes are identical .",
    "it is not the case for these three approximations since the ejected electron is described by a free dirac plane wave .",
    "the dvpwba1 tdcs is larger than the two other non relativistic tdcss by a factor @xmath141 at the maximum for @xmath129 for the absorption process and the emission process but these relativistic tdcss are not identical .",
    "the tdcs for the emission of one photon is smaller than the corresponding one for the absorption of one photon by a factor @xmath142 at the same maximum .",
    "these remarks are not without interest since a crucial test of our next model ( all electrons are described by dirac - volkov plane waves ) will be to compare the two tdcss within the framework of dvpwba2 for these two processes .",
    "it will be a sound consistency check of our calculations .        in fig .",
    "3 , we show the three summed tdcss for an exchange of @xmath144 photons and we obtain close curves for the non relativistic plane wave and coulomb born results with the relativistic plane wave tdcs a little lower than the former ones in the vicinity of the peak at @xmath129 . for angles lower or larger than @xmath129 , the three tdcss give nearly the same results . the dressing of angular coordinates being negligeable , the maximum is maintained for the above mentionned value of @xmath95 but in the relativistic regime , this maximum is shifted . also",

    "we have obtained results that converge to the relativistic tdcs without laser field but complete convergence is not reached since the ejected electron is not properly described .",
    "now , we discuss the results obtained within the framework of the three more accurate approximations ( dvpwba2 , nrpwba2 , nrcba2 ) in the same non relativistic regime . the description of the ejected electron by a dirac - volkov plane wave being more accurate and necessary on physical grounds ( there are no constraints that forbid the ejected electron to exchange photons with the laser field ) , we have first investigated the case where no photon is exchanged at all ( @xmath147 ) .",
    "there is a shift of the location for the maximum corresponding to the relativistic tdcs while the two non relativistic tdcss are nearly the same .",
    "the magnitude of the tdcss is also considerably reduced .",
    "we have tdcs(dvrpwba2 ) @xmath148 @xmath149 @xmath107 for @xmath150 while tdcs(nrpwba2 ) @xmath151 tdcs(nrcba2 ) @xmath152",

    "the other peaks can also be traced back to the behaviour of this sum .",

    "4 , we show the relativistic and non relativistic tdcss for @xmath159 and @xmath160 . we have obtained the same curve for the case @xmath157 and @xmath161 . for these two curves , the maximum shifts back to the value @xmath129 . as the number of exchanged photons @xmath162 is linked both to the incident and scattered electron , we simulated a process where the number @xmath163 to check the corresponding influence on the tdcss and on the location of the maximum .",

    "<S> within the framework of the coplanar binary geometry where it is justified to use plane wave solutions for the study of the @xmath0 reaction and in the presence of a circularly polarized laser field , we introduce as a first step the dvrpwba1 ( dirac - volkov plane wave born approximation1 ) where we take into account only the relativistic dressing of the incident and scattered electrons . </S>",
    "<S> then , we introduce the dvrpwba2 ( dirac - volkov plane wave born approximation2 ) where we take totally into account the relativistic dressing of the incident , scattered and ejected electrons . </S>",
    "<S> we then compare the corresponding triple differential cross sections for laser - assisted ionization of atomic hydrogen by electron impact both for the non relativistic and the relativistic regime . </S>",
