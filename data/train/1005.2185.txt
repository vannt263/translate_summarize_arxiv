    "in addition to the known standard model ( sm ) quarks , models beyond the sm generally include new matter content . such extended matter content is strongly constrained by the requirement of gauge anomaly cancellation @xcite . in recent years ,",
    "vector - like quarks ( for reviews see @xcite ) have been studied since the possibility of vector - like @xmath0 singlet quarks is a particularly simple and minimal anomaly free extension of the sm . from a top - down model building perspective , vector - like matter of this form is also interesting .",
    "extensions of the sm involving new vector - like matter have been explored in the context of susy to address the little hierarchy problem @xcite , and triplets of vector - like quarks can also appear in grand unified models and string compactifications that embed the sm into an @xmath3 group @xcite .    the current phenomenological constraints on vector - like matter come from direct production bounds at the tevatron and flavour physics .",
    "tevatron studies exclude a heavy @xmath4 with sm like couplings at @xmath5 cl up to @xmath6 @xcite and a heavy @xmath7 with sm like couplings at @xmath5 cl up to @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "flavour constraints are also significant for vector - like quarks .",
    "the mixing of @xmath9 vector - like quarks with the sm quarks causes the @xmath10 sm ckm matrix to become non - unitary as it is extended to a @xmath11 unitary matrix .",
    "non - unitarity of this form is tightly constrained . by mixing with the vector - like quarks , effective tree level flavour changing neutral currents ( fcnc )",
    "could also be induced for the sm quarks ( see @xcite for recent studies ) .",
    "although flavour constraints are stringent due to the lack of @xmath12 clearly statistically significant evidence of non - sm fcnc s ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a survey ) , these constraints do not provide a direct mass bound , as the mixing factors are generally unknown and can be chosen to be small .",
    "thus , it is interesting to examine vector - like quark models within the framework of minimal flavour violation ( mfv ) @xcite where new physics effects are flavour conserving apart from the effects of flavour breaking by insertions of yukawa matrices , as in the sm .",
    "mfv is also predictive in terms of the allowed representations and couplings of new physics .",
    "for example , it has been shown that only a single flavour singlet scalar representation is allowed by mfv besides the higgs @xcite ( see @xcite for recent studies ) . when the scalar is allowed to transform under the flavour symmetry more representations are allowed @xcite , but mfv remains a predictive formalism that constrains the allowed mass spectra and couplings .",
    "similarly , for the vector quark models we study , the strength of the vector - quark quark mixings are no longer uncorrelated free parameters in the theory due to mfv .    in this paper we examine vector - like quark models whose weyl spinors transform as flavour triplets when mfv is an approximate global symmetry .",
    "we will show that at leading order in the mfv expansion only two models exist that are naturally phenomenologically viable ; one with a triplet of charge @xmath13 vector - like quarks and one with a triplet of charge @xmath14 vector - like quarks . by naturally phenomenologically viable we mean that the new flavour changing effects in the model are suppressed , in agreement with experiment , not simply through the choice of parameters but in a way that follows from the group structure and representation content of the theory .",
    "this flavour naturalness criteria is a generalization of the glashow - weinberg criteria for natural fcnc suppression @xcite and is not guaranteed by mfv alone . the continuing success of the sm in the flavour physics program , with ever more flavour changing decays and flavour oscillation measurements probing the weak scale and consistent with the sm",
    ", strongly implies that models which satisfy this naturalness criteria are promising models to search for in the lhc era .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we present our procedure for solving the mass spectrum of the models and determine the two models that are naturally viable .",
    "we then determine the allowed parameter space considering relevant collider , flavour and electroweak precision data ( ewpd ) constraints in section iii .",
    "we then turn to the expected cross sections at lhc for the allowed remaining parameter space of these models in section iv .",
    "finally , we comment on similar flavour triplet mfv models of this form when @xmath15 .",
    "the sm has a global @xmath16 flavour symmetry that is only broken by the sm yukawa interactions . decomposing the abelian quark subgroup of this symmetry as g_f = su(3)_u su(3)_d su(3)_q",
    ", one can formally restore this subgroup of the flavour symmetry by treating the yukawa matrices as spurions that transform as g_d ~(1,|3,3 )  , g_u ~(|3,1,3 )  , such that mfv forbids fcnc s at tree level .",
    "the flavour symmetry is broken by insertions of the spurions @xmath17 or @xmath18 when @xmath19 or @xmath20 indices are contracted .",
    "we use notation where each insertion is accompanied by ( the unknown constant ) @xmath21 and choose @xmath22 . except for the top ,",
    "all yukawas are already small so the symmetry breaking effects are highly suppressed . for the top ,",
    "our perturbative expansion in @xmath23 is appropriate under this assumption .",
    "the naturalness of this assumption depends on the uv completion of the models under study and specifying a uv completion is beyond the scope of this work . for approaches to mfv without this assumption",
    "see @xcite . in our analysis , due to this assumption , the effects of mixing are the dominant constraint on the mass scale of the model .    in this paper",
    ", we are considering models whose left- and right - handed ( weyl spinor ) components transform as flavour triplets .",
    "similar mfv models have been examined before in both the quark and lepton sector @xcite .",
    "both of these works assume that the bare mass parameters are far larger than the electroweak scale @xmath24 , which can be appropriate for @xmath25 tev scale vector - like quark masses . in this paper",
    ", we directly solve the models at leading order in the mfv expansion without this assumption and study the constraints and prospects for these models in much greater detail .",
    "this turns out to be instructive as we argue it singles out two models that are naturally phenomenologically viable .",
    "we will discuss our approach in some detail for an extension of the sm with vector - like down quarks .",
    "the discussion for vector - like up quarks is similar .",
    "the lagrangian including the right- and left - handed chiral fields of the vector - like quarks is the following @xmath26\\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the transformations allowed under @xmath27 are listed in table i for the new couplings and fields .",
    "note that the couplings @xmath28 are matrices whose transformation law depends on the model and is such that the lagrangian is invariant under @xmath27 .",
    "mfv requires that these matrices be yukawas or identity matrices .",
    "the factors @xmath29 set the scale of the couplings .",
    "the fields @xmath30 , @xmath31 are triplets under @xmath32 , singlets under @xmath0 and have hypercharge @xmath33 .",
    "as in the sm , when mfv is imposed , @xmath34 transforms as @xmath35 while @xmath2 transforms as @xmath36 under @xmath37 .",
    ".representations of @xmath38 allowed by mfv .",
    "we have used the fact that in models @xmath39 the @xmath40 has the same transformation as @xmath2 under the flavour and gauge groups to rotate to a basis in @xmath41 space where the mixing term vanishes @xcite .",
    "we also note that model iv predicts non - hierarchical corrections to sm masses due to mixing .",
    "these corrections require extra tuning to cancel against the sm masses when @xmath42 .",
    "this was indicated with a star appended to the relevant coupling . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     where c_i =  ,  _",
    "1,2,3=  ,  ^phys_d ^0_d  . in this model",
    "it is not possible to choose @xmath43 in such a way that the @xmath10 subblocks of eq .",
    "( [ diag ] ) are diagonal . nevertheless , we take @xmath44 and write the two left submatrices in a diagonal form and the two right submatrices as diagonal matrices multiplied by @xmath45 .",
    "we use the wolfenstein parametrization and neglect all terms of order @xmath46 and higher .",
    "we assume that @xmath47 are approximately equal to the sm physical masses up to small corrections , expanding in @xmath48 as usual to simplify the eigenvalues and eigenvectors .",
    "the rotation matrices in this model are identical in form as in model ii with the replacement @xmath49 .",
    "the physics of this model is substantially the same , and unnatural with respect to flavour constraints .",
    "the only difference is that the light up quark masses receive a large correction to their higgs coupling as @xmath50 due to @xmath51 .",
