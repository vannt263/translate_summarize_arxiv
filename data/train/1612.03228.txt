    "transition metal dichalcogenides ( tmds ) constitute a new generation of semiconducting materials .",
    "their electronic and optical properties have been extensively studied since the discovery of the direct band gap in monolayer mos@xmath0 in 2010 @xcite , as understanding light - matter interactions in tmd monolayers is essential for developing applications in electronics , photonics , and optoelectronics .",
    "so far , ultrafast excitonic dynamics @xcite , coupled spin - valley physics @xcite , large exciton binding energies @xcite , and nonlinear optical responses @xcite in tmd monolayers have been well studied .",
    "it has been also shown that van der waals heterostructures with different tmd monolayers can be constructed @xcite to realize devices with multiple functionalities .",
    "after much effort , res@xmath0 has been identified as an anomalous member of the tmd family . in 2014 ,",
    "few - layer and bulk samples of res@xmath0 were reported to display monolayer behavior @xcite . since then",
    "the optical and electrical properties of res@xmath0 have been intensively investigated .",
    "coherent control of ballistic transport has been realized in bulk res@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the in - plane anisotropic optical and electrical properties of monolayer res@xmath0 have also been experimentally studied @xcite .",
    "a recent work has shown that stacking orders can be resolved by raman spectroscopy , due to the unique crystal structure of res@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "based on these novel properties , a wide spectrum of applications using res@xmath0 has been proposed . among them are energy storage devices @xcite , integrated digital converters @xcite , and sensitive photodetectors @xcite .",
    "thus res@xmath0 has not only become a unique platform for novel 2d physics , but also an unusual member of tmds to construct van der waals heterostructures .",
    "unlike the tmd monolayers based on mo and w , which form in a hexagonal lattice , monolayer res@xmath0 has a stable distorted @xmath4 crystal lattice @xcite .",
    "re atomic chains formed by re - re bonding run along the direction of the @xmath5-axis , enabling the in - plane anisotropy of electrical and optical response .",
    "however , to date there have been no reports of the nonlinear optical properties of res@xmath0 .",
    "since nonlinear optical properties are known to be extremely sensitive to the lattice symmetries @xcite , it is important to determine to what extent the lattice distortions of res@xmath0 affect its nonlinear optical properties .    in this paper",
    ", we report experimental results of third harmonic generation ( thg ) in monolayer and multilayer res@xmath0 .",
    "we determine the third - order susceptibility of monolayer res@xmath0 and find that its magnitude is about one order of magnitude larger than those of hexagonal tmds such as mos@xmath0 @xcite .",

    "as shown in figure [ f1](a ) , a half wave plate ( hw ) and a glan prism ( gp ) are used to adjust the power and the polarization direction of the fundamental pulses .",
    "the fundamental pulses at @xmath7 are tightly focused on the sample by an objective lens ( ob1 ) with a numerical aperture ( na ) of 0.42 .",
    "the generated third harmonic pulses are collected by another objective lens ( ob2 ) with the same na .",
    "a spectrometer ( sm ) is employed to directly measure the power of the third harmonic pulses at @xmath8 , and a polarizer ( p ) before the spectrometer is used to resolve the horizontal and vertical components of the third harmonic pulses . a charge - coupled device ( ccd ) , a beamsplitter ( bs ) , and the ob1 serve as a microscope to monitor the focusing position on the sample by collecting the reflected light at @xmath8 .",
    "figure [ f1](b ) shows a diagram of thg in monolayer res@xmath0 with a simplified band structure , where three photons at @xmath7 generate one photon at @xmath8 .",
    "the fundamental photon energy is about @xmath9 ev ( 1515 nm ) , while the energy of the generated photons is about @xmath10 ev ( 505 nm ) .",
    "since the band gap of monolayer res@xmath0 is about 1.53 ev ( 810 nm ) , the fundamental pulse can not be absorbed by monolayer res@xmath0 via one - photon absorption .",
    "the res@xmath0 samples are fabricated on the surface of pdms by mechanical exfoliation and transferred to a bk7 glass substrate about 0.48 mm thick @xcite .",

    ", the black line indicates a cross section of our monolayer and multilayer samples . as shown in figure [ f3](b ) , the normalized optical contrast of the monolayer ( 1 l , 0.73 nm thick ) and multilayer samples in the green channel are about 7.6  % and 100  % , respectively . since each layer increases the optical contrast by roughly 7.6  % , the multilayer sample is identified as 13 l , which is about 9.5 nm thick .",
    "similarly , the transition region with an optical contrast of @xmath14 is about 1 @xmath15 m wide and identified as 12 l.",
    "in this section we carry out a point group symmetry analysis for the thg of undistorted @xmath4 layered materials ; we use the lab coordinates shown in figure [ f2](a ) .    the polarization associated with thg",
    "is determined by the third order susceptibility @xmath16 , which is a rank-4 tensor that respects the symmetries of the point group of the lattice , and the applied electric field @xmath17 , through @xmath18 the electric field associated with the generated radiation is proportional to the polarization @xmath19 , so the intensity of the generated radiation is proportional to @xmath20 .",
    "the point group of an undistorted @xmath4 lattice is @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) , but in the presence of a substrate the symmetry operations that act on the perpendicular axis are broken , and the point group is @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) . only the planar components of @xmath25 are relevant for normal incidence , and there are only 3 such independent components for both point groups @xmath21 and @xmath23 , namely @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "consequently , the thg has the same angular dependence regardless of the presence of the substrate . describing the incident field as @xmath29 ,",

    "we study thg of monolayer res@xmath0 by focusing the fundamental field on the red dot 1 as shown in figure [ f2](a ) . the thg spectrum is shown as the red curve in the inset of figure [ f5](a ) , which corresponds to @xmath33 and a fundamental fluence of 12.6 mj / cm@xmath3 . in our experiments ,",
    "third harmonic frequencies can also be generated from the bk7 glass substrate .",
    "the blue curve in the inset of figure [ f5](a ) , which is about @xmath35 of the red curve , shows the third harmonic spectrum of the bk7 glass substrate under the same experimental conditions as the monolayer res@xmath0 sample .",
    "in addition , we notice that thg from bk7 glass substrate becomes maximal when moving the @xmath7 beam focus away from the surface and into the bk7 glass substrate .",
    "thus we study thg from the bk7 glass substrate by moving the focus of the fundamental beam into the substrate by a few @xmath15 m .",
    "there is no angular dependence of thg power from the bk7 glass substrate when the power of the fundamental beam is fixed at 23 mw , as shown in figure [ f5](b ) , and the contribution from the bk7 glass substrate is much smaller than the thg from res@xmath0 samples ; it has no effect in our analysis .",
    "the fundamental power dependence of thg in monolayer res@xmath0 is shown in figure [ f5](a ) for @xmath36 .",

    "horizontal and vertical polarizations of the thg field are resolved by the polarizer before the spectrometer .",
    "the results are plotted in figure [ f6](a ) , where the lines corresponding to the horizontal and vertical polarizations have the shape of a twisted dumbbell , and the total power ( i.e. the sum of the horizontal and vertical components ) of the thg field from monolayer res@xmath0 is anisotropic as a function of @xmath13 .    in order to quantify the thg in monolayer res@xmath0 , we deduce the magnitude of the third - order susceptibility @xmath1 from the power of the thg field that reaches the detector @xmath37 and that of the fundamental incident field @xmath38 . here",
    "we extract an estimate for the magnitude of the largest component of @xmath39 , which we denote by @xmath1 .",
    "the fundamental field at the sample is related to the incident field by fresnel equations .",
    "the induced polarization is related to the fundamental field at the sample by eq .",
    "( [ polariz ] ) . the thg field at the sample can then be determined from the polarization @xcite , which in turn determines the field that is transmitted through the glass substrate and collected by the detector .",
    "considering pulses that are gaussian in both space and time , the final expression is @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the thickness of the sample , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are respectively the indices of refraction of air and the bk7 glass substrate ( which are both independent of the frequencies involved , @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) ; @xmath44 and @xmath45 are respectively the spot size width and the pulse duration measured at full width at half maximum , and @xmath46 mhz is the laser repetition rate . see the supplemental material @xcite for details on the derivation of this equation . by using the parameters measured in our experiment ( @xmath47 nm , @xmath48 fs , @xmath49 @xmath15 m , and @xmath50 nm )",
    ", we extract the maximal value of @xmath51 m@xmath3/v@xmath3 for @xmath52 .",
    "the maximal thg is confirmed to occur when the polarization of the fundamental field is along the @xmath5-axis , as determined by angular dependent transient absorption .",
    "thus , thg measurements can be also used to determine the lattice orientation of res@xmath0 .",
    "when @xmath53 , the thg field power reduces to about one third of the maximal value , so @xmath54 m@xmath3/v@xmath3 is the minimal value of the susceptibility .",

    "horizontal , vertical components of total thg power ( blue ) are in red and black , respectively .",
    "the fundamental pulse power is fixed at 30.2 mw . ]    to confirm the procedure used to extract the @xmath1 of the monolayer res@xmath0 sample , we move the fundamental pulse focus spot to the bk7 glass substrate , which allows us to measure the thg from the bk7 glass substrate under the same conditions .",
    "the angular dependence of thg in the bk7 glass substrate is isotropic , as shown in figure [ f5](b ) .",
    "we extract a @xmath55 m@xmath3/v@xmath3 for the bk7 substrate , which is in good agreement with the reported values of @xmath56 m@xmath3/v@xmath3 for a fundamental wavelength of 1064 nm and @xmath57 m@xmath3/v@xmath3 for 1907 nm @xcite .",
    "the power of the thg due to the substrate is more than @xmath58 times smaller than that of the res@xmath0 , as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ f5 ] ( a ) .",
    "thus , even the heterodyne contribution of the substrate to the total power of the thg is at least @xmath59 times smaller than that due exclusively to the res@xmath0 sample , which lies within the experimental precision .",
    "so the contribution of thg from the bk7 glass substrate is ignored in our analysis .",
    "we also use the method described above to study the thg from multilayer res@xmath0 by focusing the fundamental laser on the attached multilayer part of the sample , as indicated by the red dot 2 in fig . [ f2](a ) .",
    "the observed thg from the attached multilayer ( 13 l ) shows an angular dependence very similar to that of monolayer res@xmath0 .",
    "this is a reasonable result , since the attached multilayer should have the same crystal orientation of the monolayer , resulting in the same in - plane symmetry of thg .",
    "in addition , the thg signal in the multilayer sample is significantly larger than that from the monolayer . due to the weak interlayer coupling in res@xmath0",
    ", the thg field from a multilayer sample can be considered as the addition of thg fields generated in each individual layer , and the thg induced power would be simply expected to be proportional to the square of the sample thickness @xmath41  see eq . [ eq : chi3power ] .",
    "thus , the thg power from the 13 l sample would be expected to increase by a factor of 169 , relative to the monolayer , for each @xmath13 . however , since the photon energy of thg is higher than the band gap of res@xmath0 , the induced thg will be absorbed via one - photon absorption when propagating in the multilayer sample .",
    "it has been well - known that linear absorption in res@xmath0 is in - plane anisotropic .",
    "a maximum ( minimum ) absorption coefficient is expected when light polarization is along ( perpendicular to ) the @xmath5-axis , which is clearly revealed by our experimental results : fig .",
    "[ f6 ] shows that when compared to the monolayer thg , the multilayer thg is mostly suppressed by absorption when the polarization of the induced thg is along the @xmath5-axis ( @xmath60 )",
    ".    finally , the distorted dumbbell shapes for the horizontal and vertical polarizations of the thg field are consistent with the predictions from the point group symmetry analysis .",
    "since we have used bk7 glass substrate as a reference material , we rule out any anisotropic artifact from the measurements , and we can safely attribute the anisotropic thg to the lattice distortions of res@xmath0 .",
    "in summary , we observed strong and anisotropic third harmonic generation ( thg ) in monolayer and multilayer res@xmath0 . the third - order susceptibility of monolayer res@xmath0 ,",
    "@xmath1 was found to be on the order of 10@xmath61 m@xmath3/v@xmath3 , which is about one order of magnitude higher than reported values in hexagonal tmds , such as mos@xmath0 .",
    "this large nonlinear optical response suggests potential applications of this material in optoelectronic devices involving third - order nonlinear processes .",
    "a point group symmetry analysis indicates that the thg in crystals with a perfect @xmath4 lattice would be isotropic , i.e. the total thg intensity would be independent of the polarization of the incident field .",
    "however , we observed significant deviation from this prediction , which can be attributed to the lattice distortions .",
    "this illustrates the importance of lattice distortions for the nonlinear optical response of this material , and indicate that they should not be neglected in theoretical models .",
