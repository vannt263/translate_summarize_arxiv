    "our motivation to prove the local asymmetry estimate in theorem  [ thm : asym ] comes from two main sources .",

    "the idea of the proof of theorem  [ thm : asym ] is based on a method of carleman in  @xcite .",

    "our second source of motivation comes from our work  @xcite . in that work we gave a lower bound for the inner radius of nodal domains based on a growth bound for eigenfunctions by h.  donnelly and c.  fefferman and the local courant s nodal domain theorem :    [ thm : local - courant ] let @xmath0 be a closed riemannian manifold of dimension @xmath1 .",
