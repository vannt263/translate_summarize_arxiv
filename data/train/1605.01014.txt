    "consistent localization of semantically meaningful landmarks or keypoints in images forms a precursor to several important applications in computer vision , such as face recognition , human body pose estimation or 3d visualization .",
    "however , it remains a significant challenge due to the need to handle non - rigid shape deformations , appearance variations and occlusions .",
    "for instance , facial landmark localization must handle not only coarse variations such as head pose and illumination , but also finer ones such as expressions and skin tones .",
    "human body pose estimation introduces additional challenges in the form of large layout changes of parts due to articulations .",
    "objects such as birds display tremendous variations in both appearance across species , as well as shape within the same species ( for example , a perched bird as opposed to a flying one ) , which renders accurate part localization a largely open problem .",
    "consequently , there have been a wide range of approaches to solve the problem , starting with those related to pca - based shape constraints ( such as active shape models @xcite , active appearance models @xcite and constrained local models @xcite ) and pictorial structures ( such as dpm @xcite and poselets @xcite ) . in recent years",
    ", the advent of convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) has led to significant gains in feature representation @xcite",
    ". in particular , cascaded regression networks specifically designed for problems such as facial landmark localization @xcite or human body pose estimation @xcite have led to improvements by exploiting problem structure at coarse and fine levels . but",
    "challenges for such frameworks have been the need for careful design and initialization , the difficulty of training complex cascades as well as the absence of learned geometric relationships .        in this paper",
    ", we propose a novel cascaded framework , termed deep deformation network ( ddn ) , that also decomposes landmark localization into coarse and fine localization stages .",
    "but in contrast to prior works , we do not train cascaded regressors to learn a mapping between cnn features and landmark locations . rather , stages in our cascade explicitly account for the geometric structure of the problem within the cnn framework .",
    "we postulate that this has three advantages .",
    "first , our framework is easier to train and test , in contrast to previous cascaded regressors where proper initialization is required and necessitates training a battery of individual cnns as sub - problems .",
    "second , incorporation of geometric structures at both the coarse and fine levels regularizes the learning for each stage of the cascade by acting as spatial priors .",
    "third , our cascade structure is general and still results in higher accuracy by learning part geometries and avoiding hard - coded connections of parts .",
    "these advantages are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : teaser ] .",
    "specifically , in section [ sec : method ] , we propose two distinct mechanisms to inject geometric knowledge into the problem of landmark localization .",
    "first , in section [ sec : sbn ] , we propose a shape basis network ( sbn ) to predict the optimal shape that lies on a low - rank manifold defined by the training samples .",
    "our hypothesis is that shapes or landmarks for each object type reside close to a shape space , for which a low - rank decomposition reduces representation complexity and acts as regularization for learning .",
    "note that unlike dpm , we do not define geometric connections among parts prior to localization , rather these relationships are learned .",
    "further , even cascaded cnn frameworks such as @xcite train individual cnns for pre - defined relative localization of groups of parts within the first level of the cascade , which serves as initialization for later stages .",
    "our sbn avoids such delicate considerations in favor of a learned basis that provides good global initializations .",
    "second , in section [ sec : ptn ] , we propose a point transformer network ( ptn ) that learns the optimal local deformation in the form of a thin - plate spline ( tps ) transformation that maps the initialized landmark to its final position .",
    "a notable feature of our framework is its generality .",
    "prior works explicitly design network structures to handle shape and appearance properties specific to object types such as faces , human bodies or birds .",
    "in contrast , our insights are quite general - a shape basis representation is suitable for regularized learning of a global initialization in a cnn framework , following which local deformations through learned tps transformations can finely localize landmarks .",
    "we demonstrate this generality in section [ sec : experiments ] with extensive experiments on landmark localization that achieve state - of - the - art in accuracy for three distinct object types , namely faces , human bodies and birds , on several different benchmarks .",
    "we use the same cnn architectures for each of these experiments , with identical and novel but straightforward training mechanisms .    to summarize , the main contributions of this paper are :    * a novel cascaded cnn framework , called deep deformation network , for highly accurate landmark localization .",
    "* a shape basis network that learns a low - rank representation for global object shape . * a point transformer network that learns local non - rigid transformations for fine deformations , using the sbn output as an initialization .",

    "similar to warpnet @xcite , we move beyond the motivation of spatial transformer as an attention mechanism driven by the classification objective , to predict a non - rigid transformation for geometric alignment .",
    "in contrast to warpnet , we exploit both supervised and synthesized landmarks and use the point transformer network only for finer local deformations , while using the earlier stage of the cascade ( the shape basis network ) for global alignment .",
    "in this section , we present a general deep network to efficiently and accurately localize object landmarks . as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : flowchart ] , the network is composed of three components :    * a modified vggnet @xcite to extract discriminative features . * a shape basis network ( sbn ) that combines a set of shape bases using weights generated from convolutional features to approximately localize the landmark . * a point transformer network ( ptn ) for local refinement using a tps transformation .",
    "the entire network is trained end - to - end .",
    "we now introduce each of the above components in detail .",
    "convolutional maps are sent to the shape basis network and point transformer network as input , where the ptn takes the sbn s output as another input to predict the final landmark positions.,scaledwidth=96.0% ]      for feature extraction , we adopt the vgg-16 network @xcite that achieves state - of - the - art performance in various applications @xcite . the upper left corner in fig .",
    "[ fig : flowchart ] shows the network structure , where each stage consists of a convolutional layer followed by a relu unit .",
    "we apply 2 stride across the network .",
    "similar to most localization algorithms , our network takes as input a region of interest cropped by an object detector .",
    "we scale input images to @xmath0 resolution for facial landmark localization and @xmath1 for body and bird pose estimation . compared to classification and detection tasks",
    ", landmark localization requires extracting much finer or low - level image information .",
    "therefore , we remove the last stage from the original @xmath2-stage vgg-16 network of @xcite",
    ". we also experimented with using just the first three stages , but it performs worse than using four stages . in addition , we remove the pooling layers since we find they harm the localization performance .",
    "we hypothesize that shift - invariance achieved by pooling layers is helpful for recognition tasks , but it is beneficial to keep the learned features shift - sensitive for keypoint localization . given an image at @xmath0 resolution , the four - stage convolutional layers generate a @xmath3 response map with @xmath4 output channels .",
    "let @xmath5 denote the features extracted by the convolutional layers .",
    "each training image is annotated with up to @xmath6 2d landmarks , denoted @xmath7^\\top \\in { \\mathbb{r}}^{2n}$ ] . to predict landmark locations , previous works such as @xcite learn a direct mapping between cnn features @xmath8 and ground - truth landmarks @xmath9 . despite the success of these approaches , learning a vanilla regressor has limitations alluded to in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] .",
    "first , a single linear model is not powerful enough to handle large shape variations .",
    "although cascade regression can largely improve the performance , a proper initialization is required , which is non - trivial .",
    "second , with limited data , training a large - capacity network without regularization from geometric constraints entails a high risk of overfitting .",
    "both of the above limitations are effectively addressed by our shape basis network ( sbn ) , which predicts optimal object shape that lies in a low - dimensional manifold defined by the training samples . intuitively , while cnns allow learning highly descriptive feature representations , frameworks such as active shape models @xcite have been historically effective in learning with non - linear pose manifolds .",
    "our sbn provides an end - to - end trainable framework to combine these complementary advantages . besides , for more challenging tasks , _",
    "i.e._human body , the highly articulated structure can not be easily represented by multi - scale autoencoder or detection  @xcite .",
    "the sbn complete basis representation alleviates the problem , while retaining accuracy and low cost .",
    "more specifically , sbn predicts the shape @xmath10^\\top \\in { \\mathbb{r}}^{2n}$ ] as , @xmath11 here @xmath12 is the mean shape among all training inputs , the columns of @xmath13 store the top-@xmath14 orthogonal pca bases and @xmath15 is a non - linear mapping parameterized by @xmath16 that takes the cnn feature @xmath8 as input to generate the basis weights @xmath17 as output .",
    "we choose @xmath14 to preserve @xmath18 of the energy in the covariance matrix of the training inputs , @xmath19 .",
    "as shown in upper - right corner of fig .",
    "[ fig : sbnptn]a , the mapping @xmath20 is represented by stacking two fully connected layers , where the first layer encodes each input as a @xmath21-d vector , which is further reduced to @xmath14 dimension by the second one .",
    "conceptually , we jointly train sbn with other network components in an end - to - end manner . during backward propagation ,",
    "given the gradient @xmath22 , the gradient of @xmath23 is available as @xmath24 .",
    "we then propagate this gradient back to update the parameters @xmath16 for the fully connected layers as well as the lower convolutional layers .    in practice , we find it advantageous to pre - train the sbn on a simpler task and fine - tune with the later stages of the cascade .",
    "this is a shared motivation with curriculum learning @xcite and avoids the difficulties of training the whole network from scratch . given the pca shape model ( @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) and the set of training images @xmath8 , we pre - train sbn to seek the optimal embedding @xmath27 such that the euclidean distance between the prediction and the ground - truth ( @xmath9 ) is minimized , that is , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a regularization factor that penalizes coefficients with large @xmath30 norm .",
    "we set @xmath31 in all experiments .",
    "to solve , we propagate back the gradient over @xmath23 , @xmath32 to update the parameters @xmath16 of the fully connected layers and the lower layers .",
    "thus , the sbn brings to bear the powerful cnn framework to generate embedding coefficients @xmath23 that span the highly nonlinear pose manifold .",
    "the low - rank truncation inherent in the representation makes sbn clearly insufficient for localization on its own . optimizing both the coefficients and pca basis is possible .",
    "the orthogonality of the basis should be preserved , which causes extra efforts in tuning the network .",
    "as we assume , the role of sbn is to alleviate the difficulty of learning an embedding with large non - linear distortions and to reduce the complexity of shape deformations to be considered by the next stage of the cascade .      given the input feature @xmath8 , sbn generates the object landmark @xmath33 as a linear combination of pre - defined shape bases . as discussed before , this prediction is limited by its assumption of a linear regression model . to handle more challenging pose variations , this section proposes the point transformer network ( ptn ) to deform the initialized shape ( @xmath33 ) using a thin - plate spline ( tps ) transformation to best match with ground - truth ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the refinement is not ideally local as global deformation also exists .",
    "some neural methods  @xcite emphasize more on the local response map , while ptn incorporates global transformation into the overall deformation procedure .",
    "a tps transformation consists of an affine transformation @xmath34 and a non - linear transformation parametrized by @xmath35 control points @xmath36 \\in { \\mathbb{r}}^{2 \\times m}$ ] with the corresponding coefficients @xmath37 \\in { \\mathbb{r}}^{2 \\times m}$ ] @xcite . in our experiments ,",
    "the control points form a @xmath38 grid ( that is , @xmath39 ) .",
    "the tps transformation for any 2d point @xmath40 is defined as : @xmath41 where @xmath42^\\top \\in { \\mathbb{r}}^{3}$ ] denotes @xmath43 in homogeneous form and @xmath44 is the radial basis function ( rbf )",

    "similar to sbn , this mapping @xmath48 is achieved by concatenating two fully connected layers , which first generate a @xmath21-d intermediate representation , which is then used to compute @xmath49 . see fig .",
    "[ fig : sbnptn]b for an overview of ptn . following @xcite , ptn optimizes : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the second - order derivative of transformation @xmath52 with respect to @xmath53 .",

    "it is known that can be optimized over the tps parameters @xmath58 and @xmath59 in closed form for a pair of shapes .",
    "but in our case , these two parameters are generated by the non - linear mapping @xmath48 from image features @xmath8 on - the - fly .",

    "for instance , fig .",
    "[ fig : warp ] visualizes the effect of using different spatial transformation to match an example with the mean face . by replacing the tps in with an affine transformation , ptn may warp the face to a frontal pose only to a limited extent ( fig .",

    "a common solution is to increase the regularization weight @xmath54 .",
    "however , a large @xmath54 reduces the flexibility of the tps transformation , which runs counter to ptn s purpose of generating highly non - rigid local deformations .",
    "thus , we propose a control point grid regularization method to further constrain the point transformation . for each training image",
    ", we estimate the optimal tps transformation @xmath61 from the mean shape @xmath25 to the ground truth @xmath9 offline .",

    "the values for the involved parameters are @xmath71 and @xmath72 .    to summarize , ptn forms the refinement stage for our cascade that generates highly non - rigid local deformations for a finer - level localization of landmarks .",
    "it is pertinent to note here that unlike the spatial transformer network @xcite , we directly optimize a geometric criterion rather than a classification objective .",
    "similar to warpnet @xcite , we transform point sets rather than the entire image or dense feature maps , but go beyond it in striking a balance between supervised and synthesized landmark points .",
