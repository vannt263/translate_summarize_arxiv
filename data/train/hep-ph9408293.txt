    "associate production of sleptons and squarks @xmath2 at hera and lep@xmath3lhc has been extensively discussed by numerous autors , see e.g. @xcite . if , however , squarks are heavy but sleptons are relatively light then these processes are suppressed or even unaccessible and the associate production of a slepton and a neutralino @xmath4 or a chargino @xmath5 become the most important susy processes at ep - colliders from the five possible processes which on the parton level are ( i ) @xmath6 , ( ii ) @xmath7 , ( iii ) @xmath8 , ( iv ) @xmath9 , ( v ) @xmath10 , only the associate production of the lightest neutralino @xmath11 has been investigated in the deep inelastic region @xcite , assuming however , that it is a pure photino .",
    "we have examined for lep@xmath12lhc and some representative susy - scenarios the five channels ( i ) to ( v ) and give in this paper some numerical results for associate sneutrino - neutralino / chargino production .",
    "distinguished by remarkably large total cross sections and interesting signatures , which will be  as well as the standard model background  briefly discussed , these reactions might be suitable for providing us with a detectable susy signal at lep@xmath12lhc .",
    "the detailled discussion of the signatures as well as that of the competing background has been postponed to a subsequent paper .",
    "the feynman graphs for the basic subprocesses of the reactions    @xmath13 ,    @xmath14    are shown in fig .",
    "the relevant couplings can be deduced from the interaction lagrangian of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) , see e.g. @xcite . for the susy parameters we assumed as usual @xmath15 , @xmath16 , with @xmath17 and @xmath18 , and @xmath19 ( the numerical results are not very sensitive to the value of @xmath20 ) . for the masses of the gauge bosons",
    "we have used @xmath21 gev , @xmath22 gev .",
    "we shall present numerical results at @xmath0 tev for two different mixing scenarios shown in table [ tab ] .",
    "for each of these mixing scenarios cross sections have been calculated for two different relations between sneutrino mass and squark mass : @xmath23 in scenarios ( a.1 ) and ( b.1)and @xmath24 in scenarios ( a.2 ) and ( b.2 ) .",
    "the last two scenarios ( a ) and ( b ) with @xmath25 and @xmath26 are motivated by renormalization group relations coupling the sfermion masses and the gaugino mass parameter @xmath27 of the mssm @xcite .",
    "allowing an error of at most 4% for the sneutrino and squark masses this choice is for values of @xmath27 between 45 gev and 450 gev ( and @xmath28 ) compatible with the mass relations given in @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath29 in scenarios ( a ) and ( b ) is the same as in scenarios ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",
    "notice , however , that in these scenarios both the mass and the mixing character of the neutralinos and charginos depend on the respective value of the sneutrino mass .    for the momentum transfer square @xmath30 to the quark",
    "we impose a cut with @xmath31 .",
    "while the dependence on @xmath32 is approximately logarithmic for graphs ( a ) , ( b ) , ( e ) with photon exchange those with exchange of massive gauge bosons and charginos are not very sensitive on this cut .",
    "the final step in the evaluation of the cross sections consists in folding those for the parton subprocesses with the quark distribution functions @xmath33 of glck , reya and vogt @xcite for the valence quarks and the _ u , d , s _ sea quarks .",
    "the situation is somewhat more complicated than for slepton - squark production since in our case the momentum transfer to the nucleon depends on the respective reaction mechanism in fig .",
    "1 . we have , however , numerically checked that in the kinematic region investigated here @xmath34 is a satisfactory approximation .",
    "the errors involved are less than 10% .    for the squark width entering into the graph ( c ) all contributions from two - body decays",
    "have been taken into account .",
    "the integration was performed with the monte - carlo program _ vegan_.",
    "in figs . 25 we show the total production cross sections @xmath36 as a function of the sneutrino mass for the scenarios ( a.1 ) , ( a.2 ) , ( b.1 ) and ( b.2 ) at @xmath0 tev . for comparison we give in the figs . also the corresponding cross section @xmath37 for associate sneutrino - squark production .",
    "we give no figs . for scenarios ( a ) and ( b ) since only for ( a ) the cross sections",
    "are only for the lsp @xmath38 and @xmath39 gev bigger than @xmath40 pb ( between @xmath40 and 0.1 pb ) .",
    "the cross sections for scenario ( b ) are smaller than @xmath40pb .    as a consequence of the large @xmath41-couplings in the feynman graphs ( a ) ,",
    "( b ) , ( e ) of fig .",
    "1 the cross sections for zino like neutralinos are comparable to ( scenario ( b ) ) or even considerably higher ( scenario ( a ) ) than those for @xmath1-production .",
    "therefore the question which of the four neutralinos will be produced with the highest rate sensitively depends on the mixing scenario .",
    "thus in scenario ( a.2 ) the cross section for @xmath42 and in scenario ( b.2 ) even that for the heaviest neutralino is the dominating one being ten times as large as that for the lightest neutralino @xmath11 .    since for pure photinos graph ( b ) does not contribute ,",
    "the cross section for photino like neutralinos is much smaller than that for zino like neutralinos . for larger selectron masses",
    "also graph ( a ) is suppressed by the selectron propagator .",
    "the steep ascent of the cross sections for @xmath11 in scenario ( a.1 ) and @xmath43 in scenario ( b.1 ) originates from the contribution of graph ( c ) , where for @xmath23 the squark approaches its mass shell in the accessible region of the phase space .",
    "even the relatively small gaugino components of the light neutralinos @xmath44 in ( b.1 ) suffice to produce this step in the cross sections .",
    "if , however , the zino component is strong enough , this effect will be suppressed by the strong contributions of the feynman diagrams ( a ) , ( b ) , ( e ) .    since for pure higgsinos",
    "only graph ( e ) contributes , the cross sections for the heavy higgsino - like neutralinos @xmath45 in scenarios ( a.1 ) and ( a.2 ) are nearly independent of the squark mass .",
    "the total cross sections @xmath47 are shown in figs . 68 . due to the dominance of the contributions from gauge boson exchange in graphs ( a ) ,",
    "( b ) , ( e ) , the numerical results are nearly identical for @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "we therefore give the results for scenarios ( a.1),(b.1 ) and ( b ) only .",
    "we give no results for scenario ( a ) since these results are quite similar to those in scenario ( b ) .",
    "contrary to @xmath50-production all partons are contributing to @xmath51-production .",
    "together with the strong @xmath52-couplings in graphs ( a ) , ( b ) , ( e ) and photon couplings in graphs ( b ) , ( e ) this leads for all scenarios to cross sections for @xmath53-production being between one and two orders of magnitude larger than those for @xmath54-production .",
    "the cross section is the highest for the light wino - like @xmath55 in scenario ( a.1 ) but even for the heavy wino - like @xmath56 in ( b.1 ) it is considerably larger than that for @xmath54-production and also larger than that for the light higgsino - like state @xmath57 , with substantial contributions from graph ( e ) only .",
    "in contrast to sneutrino - neutralino production also for scenarios ( a ) and ( b ) the cross sections for @xmath58-production are larger than @xmath40 pb in a wide range of parameter space and considerably larger than those for @xmath50-production .",
    "notice that in scenarios ( a ) and ( b ) the mass values as well as the couplings of both chargino states are varying with increasing sneutrino mass : for the lower values of @xmath59 the light chargino is wino - like and the heavy chargino is more higgsino - like .",
    "the situation changes with increasing @xmath59 so that the light chargino becomes more and more higgsino - like whereas the heavy one becomes more and more wino - like .",
    "simultaneously the mass of the heavy chargino is rapidly increasing , whereas that of the light chargino asymptotically approaches the value @xmath60 .",
    "this interplay between mass and mixing character produces the two crossings of the cross sections in fig . 8 for scenario ( b )",
    "in order to study the possible signals for associate sneutrino - neutralino / chargino production it is indispensable to include the decay of these particles as well as a discussion of the competing standard model background .",
    "here we shall restrict ourselves to some remarks , postponing a more detailled discussion of signatures and background to a subsequent paper .",
    "light supersymmetric particles decay directly into the lightest neutralino ( which is assumed to be the lightest supersymmetric particle lsp and stable ) and fermions , whereas heavy sparticles decay over complex cascades ending at the lsp . these cascade decays of heavy sparticles have two important consequences . on the one hand they will lead to events with besides one or several leptons , jets and missing energy one or two @xmath41 or @xmath52 bosons in the final state @xcite . on the other hand they can significantly enhance the possible signals of the respective process @xcite .",
    "the actual decay patterns and the dominant signatures will , however , sensitively depend on the supersymmetric parameters and the slepton mass .",
    "thus in scenarios ( a.1 ) and ( a.2 ) where the cross sections are the biggest for the processes @xmath61 and @xmath62 the dominant signatures are @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 for @xmath66 gev and @xmath63 , @xmath64 for @xmath67 gev . for scenarios ( b.1 ) and",
    "( b.4 ) on the other hand with @xmath68 and @xmath69 as the dominant processes the favored signatures are @xmath63 and @xmath70 for @xmath66 gev and @xmath71 and @xmath72 for @xmath67 gev ( @xmath73 denotes an arbitrary number of jets ) .",
    "the most important sources of background are single @xmath41 and @xmath52 production @xmath74 and @xmath75 followed by the decays @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 giving rise to events with one , two or three charged leptons @xcite . on the other hand",
    "the case of single top production @xmath79 followed by the decay @xmath80 gives rise to the @xmath70 configuration and the neutral current process @xmath81 is a source of the background for @xmath72 events @xcite .",
    "since , however , the cross section for @xmath82-production is rather small ( @xmath83 pb for @xmath84 gev and @xmath85 gev ) , one would expect that this is the least dangerous of the competing standard model backgrounds",
    ". detailled monte carlo studies taking into account the background are needed to assess the observability of the susy signal from associate sneutrino - neutralino / chargino production .",
    "we have computed for representative gaugino - higgsino mixing scenarios the total cross sections for associate sneutrino - neutralino and sneutrino - chargino production at lep@xmath3lhc . for wino - like",
    "charginos @xmath86 as well as for higgsino - gaugino mixtures they are between one and two orders of magnitude bigger than those for @xmath50-production : about 0.1pb for @xmath87gev and between 1pb and 10pb for @xmath88gev .",
    "the cross sections for a light higgsino - like chargino are still one order of magnitude higher than those for @xmath54-production .",
    "the situation is less favorable for sneutrino - neutralino production . here",
    "the cross sections are the highest for neutralinos with a strong zino component . for @xmath23",
    "the cross sections for a zino - like neutralino are generally comparable to those for @xmath89-production .",
    "if , however , the squarks are appreciably heavier than the sneutrinos ( @xmath24 ) then in a mass region where the @xmath54-cross section has already decreased to @xmath90pb that for a zino - like neutralino is still between @xmath40pb and 0.1pb .",
    "similar as for chargino production the question which of the neutralino cross sections is the dominating one depends much more on the mixing properties than on the mass of respective states .",
    "thus in our scenario ( b.2 ) even the cross section for the heaviest neutralino is for @xmath91gev the dominating one , being one order of magnitude beyond that for the lightest neutralino and surmounting that for @xmath54-production .",
    "together with the subsequent decays of the produced sparticles this leads to interesting signatures consisting in up to four charged leptons , hadronic jets , missing energy and in case of scenario ( b ) massive gauge bosons . a quantitative analysis of these signatures will be postponed to a subsequent paper .",
    "the size of the cross section obtained for sneutrino - chargino production , comparable to or even bigger than that for competing standard model processes , let us however suggest , that this process should provide an attractive channel in the search for supersymmetric events at lep@xmath3lhc .",
