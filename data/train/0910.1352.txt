    "simulations show that for some galaxies the coalescence of clump systems may lie at the root of the formation of galaxy bulges , and possibly even their supermassive nuclear black holes if it is assumed that each clump gave rise to its own intermediate mass black hole prior to their migration to the center @xcite .",
    "it would be extremely valuable to study similar objects in nearby galaxies where multi - waveband data with relatively high spatial resolution and sensitivity would allow the relevant physical processes to be probed in much greater detail .",

    "while none of the clumps bear any structural similarities with both globular and nuclear star clusters ( crosses and triangles ) , the dcos in the @xmath158 , @xmath159 , @xmath160 plane appear structurally similar to the extra - light light components in early - type galaxies ( stars and circles ) .",

    "this is several times longer than the ages that we have derived for the individual clumps .",
    "thus it is plausible that at this relatively early dynamical stage we usually see several such clumps within the effective radius of the galaxy .",
    "the diffuse light seen in the hst images may build up as the clumps lose stars due to tidal stripping while they interact with each other and with the disk and slowly migrate inward .",
    "this process may eventually lead to the formation of an inner bulge as well as the sersic profile typical of disk galaxies @xcite .      although most lbas were unresolved in the original sdss images , some showed evidence for close companions or faint extended emission .",
    "one of the major results from the hst images is that most of them show very complex morphologies at scales well below the sdss seeing or sensitivity .",

    "these observations suggest that the starbursts in lbas and the formation of the massive stellar clumps are somehow linked to the mergers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the lbas must also be sufficiently gas - rich in order for any starburst trigger to be effective .",
    "simulations show that the inflow of gas ensures that the pressure in the interstellar medium becomes larger than the internal pressure of giant molecular clouds , and that the clouds can collapse and form massive clusters before they are disrupted by supernova explosions @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that the spectral energy distributions of lbas are very different from typical starburst galaxies in the local universe .",
    "these are predominantly associated with the highly dust - obscured lirgs ( @xmath179 @xmath18 ) and ulirgs ( @xmath180 @xmath18 ) .",
    "at least ulirgs are known to be strongly associated with the different phases of galaxy  galaxy mergers , with about equal fractions showing dual nuclei ( pre - merger ) and showing indication of post - merging ( after the separate nuclei have coalesced and a period of violent relaxation starts forming an extended spheroidal component ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these mergers are found to be limited to galaxy pairs having near - equal mass ratios ( 1.5:1 on average , with a maximum of 3:1 ) .",
    "the less luminous lirgs are typically associated with much less violent events that are less effective at triggering a major starburst phase as observed in ulirgs , perhaps as a result of smaller gas fractions , orbital parameters , and larger pair mass ratios ( or a combination thereof ) . as shown in @xcite , about one third of lirgs",
    "appear in single isolated ( spiral ) galaxies . while none of the lbas qualify as ulirgs , there is some overlap with the lirgs since @xmath13050% of lbas have @xmath181 @xmath18 . as such , lbas",
    "likely represent a population of relatively unobscured mergers or merger remnants that share some characteristics with lirgs .",
    "the number density of lbas is much lower than that of lirgs .",
    "if the two populations are somehow connected , the lbas could represent a very short evolutionary phase during which the starburst can be seen relatively unobscured .",
    "alternatively , or in addition , lbas might be seen at a special viewing angle , perhaps along the axis where the starburst has blown a hole in the ism and is leaking lyman continuum photons .",
    "we have shown that the lbas are consistent with galaxies that are in the very early stages of forming their central bulge and/or core excess .",
    "local galaxies have tight correlations between the mass of their central black holes and that of their bulge and total mass .",
    "it is thus interesting to ask whether there is any evidence that a large black hole mass is accumulating in the lbas as well .",
    "the dcos are particularly intriguing in this regard : such very massive and compact objects appear to be the ideal breeding gounds for a supermassive black hole .",
    "as we have no means of directly detecting the gravitational signature of a black hole inside the massive clumps , the only way to infer the presence of a massive black hole would be through the spectral signature of an actively accreting agn . as discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : agn ] , we did not find any direct evidence for energetically significant agns in the dcos .",
    "it has long been suggested that the mass loss from stars and supernovae in a very massive compact cluster at the center of a galaxy may play a major role in the fueling of a supermassive black holes @xcite . while the stellar winds from o and wr stars and the ejecta from core - collapse supernovae may in principle provide a significant amount of material available for accretion during the early stage of a massive central starburst , these are not expected to be viable fueling mechanisms because the speed of the outflowing stellar ejecta is far in excess of the escape velocity from the star cluster @xcite .",
    "@xcite argue that the high mass - loss rates and the low mass - loss speeds of the winds from evolved agb stars may offer a steady flow of material that will be retained within the potential well of the star cluster .",
    "it can then cool and ( some fraction ) can be accreted by the supermassive black hole .",
    "thus , the growth phase of the supermassive black hole ( a powerful agn ) is expected to occur only after the time that the mechanical feeedback energy input from core collapse supernovae has subsided and the progenitors of agb stars have reached the end of their main sequence lifetimes .",
    "this will occur at @xmath150 myr after the onset of the starburst @xcite , and this age constraint is consistent with the observed ages of the nuclear starbursts observed in a sample of local agn @xcite . under the assumption of an instantaneous burst , the ages of the dcos shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : points ] and listed in table [ tab : massiveclumpprops ] are generally much lower ( 529 myr ) than 50 myr .",
    "thus , it is perhaps not unexpected that under such a scenario the dcos are currently not capable of efficiently fuelling a supermassive black hole .",
    "we also note that in the `` migrating  clump model '' advocated by @xcite and @xcite , supermassive nuclear black holes may form under the assumption that each of the clumps gave rise to an intermediate mass black hole prior to its migration toward the center where they can coalesce .",
    "such a mechanism may be able to explain the presence of seed black holes of substantial mass in the centers of gas - rich galaxies dominated by massive , turbulence - induced star - forming clumps .",
    "both mechanisms described above may therefore predict significant delay times between the onset of a starburst and that of agn .",
    "we have presented the results of the analysis of a sample of 30 low - redshift ( @xmath182 ) galaxies selected from the union of the galex and sdss surveys to have the high far - uv luminosities and small sizes characteristic of the high - redshift lyman break galaxies @xcite .",
    "these `` lyman break analogs '' ( lbas ) offer the opportunity to investigate the physical processes occurring in lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) in considerably more detail than is possible at high - redshift . in this paper we reported on the internal structures of the lba s using hst optical and uv images .",
    "we complemented these data with mid / far - ir photometry and optical spectroscopy from the sdss and the vlt .",
    "we have shown that the morphologies of the lbas are dominated by massive compact clumps of young stars . _",
    "our most unexpected and potentially important result is that we have found six galaxies in which the galaxy uv morphology is dominated by a single very compact object which is unresolved or only marginally resolved in the hst images . _",
    "these dominant compact objects ( `` dcos '' ) have estimated masses of few @xmath135 to few @xmath183 m@xmath6 and radii of - order 100 pc or less . in the other lbas",
    "we instead find multiple clumps per galaxy , the brightest of which have estimated masses of typically a few @xmath135 @xmath107 and radii of several hundred pc .",
    "we show that the galaxies containing the dcos differ from the other lbas in many respects : + 1 .",
    "their host galaxies tend to be more massive than the other lbas ( median masses of @xmath184 vs. @xmath185 @xmath107 respectively ) .",
    "+ 2 . they have systematically higher central concentrations of light than the other lbas ( the dco is typically located near the center of a larger disk or envelope ) .",
    "the dcos are found in galaxies with high mid - infrared luminosities : l@xmath186 to @xmath187 @xmath188 , roughly an order - of - magnitude more luminous than the other lbas and comparable to luminous infrared galaxies . + 4 .",
    "the galaxies with a dco are more strongly displaced from the locus of normal star forming galaxies in the standard bpt diagnostic emission - line ratio diagram .",
    "this displacement is in the sense of having larger /h@xmath31 and/or larger /h@xmath30 ratios .",
    "the dcos tend to occur in galaxies with higher gas densities and pressures as traced by the ionized gas ( @xmath127 cm@xmath24 k ) .",
    "the dcos are found in galaxies in which the star - formation rate inferred from the dust - corrected h@xmath30 luminosity tends to be smaller than that derived from the mid - ir luminosity and/or the extinction - corrected far - uv luminosity . in the most extreme cases , this discrepancy reaches roughly an order - of - magnitude .",
    "+ we have shown that the dcos are not type 1 ( unobscured ) agn .",
    "we find no evidence for the presence of a very broad ( several thousand km / s ) h@xmath30 emission - line , with the most stringent constraints provided by our vlt giraffe / argus ifu spectra . instead",
    ", these data show blue - asymmetric wings on the h@xmath30 and  line profiles indicative of a dusty outflow of ionized gas .",
    "while we can not entirely exclude the possibility that an energetically significant type 2 ( obscured ) agn is present in some or all of the dcos , we regard this possibility as unlikely .",
    "in particular , the dcos are associated with galaxies having unusually weak  and  emission - lines compared to normal star forming galaxies .",
    "this is the opposite of what is seen in starburst - agn composite systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but similar to what is seen in low redshift ir - warm starbursts @xcite .",
    "the continuum of the dcos is dominated by the light of young stars : these are clearly strong highly compact starbursts .",
    "this is consistent with both the high gas pressures and emission - line profiles : both are commonly observed in starbursts and are the signposts of supernova - driven galactic winds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we have considered two specific scenarios under which the starbursts associated with the dcos might be unusual .",
    "they may be evolved short - duration starbursts in which the rate of photoionization is relatively low because few o stars are present .",
    "they may also be `` leaky '' starbursts in which a significant fraction of the ionizing radiation escapes ( matter bounded conditions ) .",
    "the latter scenario seems less likely , since it is difficult to envision circumstances in which most of the ionizing radiation escapes the galaxy , but most of the non - ionizing uv radiation is absorbed by dust and reprocessed in the mid / far ir .    we have compared the properties of the dcos and other massive clumps to those of the nuclear star clusters typically seen in different kinds of nearby galaxies .",
    "the dcos are highly massive and dense objects that do not appear to be related to single , young star clusters which are significantly less massive ( @xmath189 m@xmath6 ) and smaller ( @xmath110 pc ) than the structures we see in the lbas .",
    "however , the dco structures are quite similar to predictions for the merger - driven starbursts that are believed to be the progenitors of the extra light or central cusps seen generically in lower - mass ( @xmath190 ) elliptical galaxies @xcite . this would be consistent with our optical images of the lbas , most of which strongly suggest on - going mergers .",
    "however , at present it is unclear whether the dco hosts could passively evolve to form a full - grown elliptical without additional merging .    more generally , the properties of the lbas are quite consistent with the idea that large jeans instabilities in a gas - rich disk will lead to the formation of highly massive star forming clumps . at high redshift , it is not yet clear what the main source of this gas is : it could be replenished continuously , or come in the form of discrete accretion events of small galaxies or clouds ( or , most likely , a combination thereof ) .",
    "these processes have been proposed to explain the properties of high-@xmath0 star - forming galaxies ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",

    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the lbas offer us the opportunity to study such processes in more detail , and compare samples across different redshifts .",
    "we speculated about why we do not see clear evidence for the formation or rapid growth of a supermassive black hole in the dcos ( which appear to be the ideal black hole nurseries ) .",
    "one intriguing possibility is that these objects are simply too young for a black hole to be forming yet .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite , the growth of a supermassive black hole inside a very massive compact star cluster may not commence until the cluster is old enough for the core - collapse supernovae phase to end ( cluster age @xmath191 50 myr ) .",
    "subsequent to this , gas shed by evolved stars will be retained in the cluster s potential well rather than being blown out .",
    "this gas can then cool , flow inward , and be used to grow the black hole .",
    "if correct , we should be able to identify a population of the descendants of the young dcos in a phase as powerful agn .",
    "this scenario might also account for the rarity of strong agn in the lbg population ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "follow - up uv spectroscopy using the hst cosmic origins spectrograph has been allocated for selected targets in cycle 17 .",
    "the uv spectra will allow us to study many of the features discussed in this paper that are relevant to lbas and to starbursts in general .",

    "<S> we report on the results of hst optical and uv imaging , spitzer mid - ir photometry and optical spectroscopy of a sample of 30 low - redshift ( @xmath0@xmath10.1 to 0.3 ) galaxies chosen from the sdss and galex surveys to be accurate local analogs of the high - redshift lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) . </S>",
    "<S> the lyman break analogs ( lbas ) are similar in stellar mass , metallicity , dust extinction , sfr , physical size and gas velocity dispersion , thus enabling a detailed investigation of many processes that are important in star forming galaxies at high redshift . </S>",
    "<S> the main optical emission line properties of lbas , including evidence for outflows , are also similar to those typically found at high redshift . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the conditions in their interstellar medium are comparable . in the uv , </S>",
    "<S> lbas are characterized by complexes of massive clumps of star - formation , while in the optical they most often show evidence for ( post-)mergers and interactions . in six cases </S>",
    "<S> , we find a single extremely massive ( up to several @xmath2 ) compact ( radius @xmath3 pc ) dominant central object ( dco ) . </S>",
    "<S> the dcos are preferentially found in lbas with the highest mid - ir luminosities ( @xmath4 to @xmath5 l@xmath6 ) and correspondingly high star formation rates ( 15 to 100 m@xmath6 per year ) . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the massive star - forming clumps ( including the dcos ) have masses much larger than the nuclear super star clusters seen in normal late type galaxies . however , the dcos do have masses , sizes , and densities similar to the excess - light / central - cusps seen in typical elliptical galaxies with masses similar to the lba galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the dcos form in the present - day examples of the dissipative mergers at high - redshift that are believed to have produced the central - cusps in local ellipticals ( consistent with the disturbed optical morphologies of the lbas ) . </S>",
    "<S> more generally , the properties of the lbas are consistent with the idea that instabilities in a gas - rich disk lead to very massive star - forming clumps that eventually coalesce to form a spheroid . </S>",
    "<S> finally we comment on the apparent lack of energetically significant agn in the dcos . </S>",
    "<S> we speculate that the dcos are too young at present to be growing a supermassive black hole because they are still in a supernova - dominated outflow phase ( age less than 50 myr ) . </S>"
