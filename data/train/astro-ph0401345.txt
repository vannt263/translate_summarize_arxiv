    "the interplay between gravitational attraction and non - gravitational forces produces systems with various shapes in the universe , including elongated structures , spheroids , discs , shells and rings .",
    "all of them participate in variety of processes and act on different scales , ranging from cosmological dimensions down to planetary sizes .",
    "some configurations , spheroidal in particular , hold by themselves , while other are maintained by an imposed control of a central body or an external field",
    ". this paper deals with discs and tori  typical configurations of rapidly circulating fluids that are governed by a central object .",
    "its gravitational attraction supports global stability of the configuration , at least below a certain critical density of the disc , while compactness of the centre suggests prospective observational methods .",
    "high density configurations suffer from instabilities and their mass contributes to general - relativity effects jointly with the central mass .    nowadays",
    "it should be self - evident that black - hole discs are of indisputable relevance to different research communities , ranging from pure relativists to astro - physicists and observational astronomers .",
    "this diversification is reflected in varied approaches that people adopt to the problem .",
    "a mathematically minded theorist would take more interest in non - trivial ( but still manageable ) analytical solutions to einstein s equations endowed with axial symmetry .",
    "an observer will want to actually _ see _ gas flows swirling in an accretion disc near a black hole ( bh ) or a compact star .",
    "astronomers often invoke accretion discs to explain spectral features observed in galactic nuclei and in close ( interacting ) binary stars , although detailed physics of accretion flows still remains uncertain .",
    "therefore , it is tempting to search for common intersections in such a broad subject .",
    "however , we will argue that serious distinctions can not be neglected which prevent one to develop an all - encompassing scheme that would describe inherently different configurations .",
    "in particular , effects of general relativity ( gr ) have a chance to govern only the innermost regions of accretions discs and their role is quickly diminished with distance from the centre .",
    "local ( non - gravitational ) physics plays crucial role and it often dominates over gravitation and governs observable properties of real systems ( perhaps the most profound example arises if one attempts to compare accretion discs around stars with those around super - massive bhs ) . in order to see where limitations of any unified scheme stem from , it is useful to discuss both simplified and general analytical models and some particular astronomical objects in more detail .    in this paper , two - dimensional models are discussed .",
    "needles to say , this is already enormous restriction . obtained solutions offer a convenient tool to elucidate physical mechanisms connected with non - spherical sources of strong gravitational field .",
    "compact toroids represent a non - trivial model of such objects that require gr , although newtonian approach provides a sufficiently accurate description in many cases .",
    "interaction with the central field is especially intriguing if the latter is generated by an ultra - compact body .",
    "the paper starts with a summary of astrophysical motivations ( section  [ sec : motivations ] ) .",
    "our attention is focused on discs around super - massive black holes , because in this case the importance of self - gravity has been traditionally acknowledged , but we also mention compact binary stars , in which case it has been recognised relatively recently that self - gravity may also play a role , especially in the context of neutron star collisions , tidal disruption and subsequent emission of high - energy gamma - rays and , possibly , gravitational waves . in section  [ sec : relativity ] , the problem of massive discs around black holes is discussed within gr . whereas gr is mainly relevant for the inner parts of self - gravitating discs ( within one hundred schwarzschild radii , @xmath0 ) , the field of actual discs is equally important for their structure at larger distances from the centre where the newtonian regime is adequate ( section [ sec : astrophysical ] ) .",
    "evidence for self - gravity in accretion discs is still rather tentative and incomplete ; some possibilities and observational implications are explored in section [ sec : consequences ] .",
    "there we also indicate the potential role of other ingredients , such as a compact nuclear star cluster in which the accretion flow may be embedded . however , the reader should be aware that important parts of the whole debate remain untouched in the present paper .",
    "in particular , we do not discuss magneto - hydrodynamical processes , neither do we address non - axially symmetric modes of the disc flow .",
    "one should bear in mind that these processes are probably crucial for understanding the mechanism of viscosity as well as launching of jets in astronomical objects .",
    "disc structures are ubiquitous in such objects where the fluid circulates around and inflows onto a central compact body . the central mass , @xmath1 , can be considered as one of the model parameters and varied by many orders . for the black - hole mass in order to maintain clear distinction from the disc mass .",
    "both contributions add to the total mass of the system .",
    "similar situation arises with angular momentum , as discussed later in the text . ]",
    "its value provides primary classification of cosmic objects .",
    "physical characteristics of accretion discs scale roughly with @xmath1 . indeed",
    ", accretion discs around super - massive black holes in active galactic nuclei and quasars share _ some _ properties with circumstellar discs in close binary systems ( e.g. , cataclysmic variable stars , x - ray binaries and micro - quasars ) . for example , both the discs around stellar - mass black holes and accretion discs around super - massive black holes may develop local and global instabilities which involve gravity . however , there are important distinctions between these two kinds of objects which prohibit any simplistic scaling .",
    "it turns out that galactic nuclear discs tend to be cooler and less dense compared to circumstellar discs , which translates to different opacity of the material , its ionization structure and , hence , different spectral properties .",
    "there has been also a very lively and still open discussion , whether the presence of a black hole in stellar - mass bh candidates ( or , rather , the absence of any hard surface ) can be revealed in the radiation properties of their discs .",
    "environmental effects bring more distinctions between different objects with accretion discs .",
    "unfortunately , at this point a bias is always inevitably introduced to our models by assumptions about turbulent transport of matter and momentum .",
    "most solutions are model dependent . neglecting this dependence",
    "can hardly be avoided when showing results of computations , nevertheless , we attempt to accentuate generic features when possible .",
    "we refer to monographs by frank , king & raine @xcite and kato , fukue & mineshige @xcite for exposition of accretion theory , to krolik @xcite and peterson @xcite for discussion of accretion flows with the emphasis on active galactic nuclei , and to various review papers @xcite summarizing recent advances as well as the problems encountered by traditional scenarios .",
    "accretion plays a crucial role in the processes of energy liberation and mass accumulation that take place in the core of astronomical objects .",
    "disc - type accretion represents an important mode which is realized under suitable circumstances , defined by the global geometrical arrangements , local microphysics of the fluid medium and the initial conditions as well .",
    "rotation is crucial and it puts discs , toroids and rings in the same category of centrifugally supported systems . by accretion discs one understands topologically toroidal fluid configurations orbiting around a central body and gradually drifting towards it , provided a mechanism to redistribute the angular momentum .",
    "the centre governs or at least substantially contributes to the gravitational field in which the medium evolves .",
    "the formation of the central body is presumed as being completed , although the accretion process gradually transfers mass and angular momentum onto the central body and thus contributes to its subsequent evolution .",
    "it is worth noting that the genesis of our own solar system with a star in the centre was imagined , by pierre - simon laplace and immanuel kant , as emerging out of a turbulent , slowly spinning nebula with flattened , disc - like shape .",
    "this was in the final years of the 18th century .",
    "the potential associated with a gravitating ring was examined in detail by f  w dyson @xcite .",
    "later , considerations associated with star and planet formation were the main driving force behind the initial development of accretion disc theory .",
    "modern evidence for such configurations was reported as early as in 1930s by baxandall @xcite in the context of binary stars . in the attempt to interpret spectrograms of the famous @xmath2  lyrae binary system and in order to explain the origin of secondary lines , visibly displaced in their wavelength , `` circulating currents in the outer envelope '' were tentatively invoked together with a gaseous envelope that surrounds the larger component . since then , interacting binary stars have been the prototypical systems for studying accretion discs .",
    "the treatment of self - gravitating discs was pursued in ostriker s newtonian equilibria of uniformly rotating , polytropic , slender rings @xcite .",
    "later , self - gravitating configurations with realistic equation of state and opacity were constructed and the basic formalism for self - gravitating bh discs was given in gr @xcite .",
    "in stellar binary systems , the gas in the disc is provided by a donor star via roche - lobe overflow or stellar wind @xcite .",
    "accretion process helps to feed the central body .",
    "if conditions are suitable , the gas radiates and provides a way to observe and study the system .",
    "historically , limiting cases were distinguished for methodological reasons and for the sake of simplification . when speaking of hydrodynamical non - self - gravitating accretion , the main assumptions concern stationarity , spatial symmetries that are imposed on the flow and on the gravitational field ( spherical flows with negligible angular momentum , axially symmetric accretion onto a moving body , and disc - like planar accretion ) , and the sound speed profile ( subsonic versus supersonic flows ) .",
    "see , e.g.  @xcite and references cited therein .",
    "it turns out that behaviour of truly three - dimensional unsteady flows is rather different and more complex @xcite .",
    "nearly spherical accretion occurs if the angular momentum content of accreted material is negligible ( this case appears appropriate mainly for accretion onto an isolated body ) . in another limit ,",
    "one ignores radial transport of the material and considers an axially symmetric toroidal configuration that preserves perfect rotation about the symmetry axis .",
    "both these cases were treated in many works , assuming the test - fluid approximation ( flow lines are determined by the central gravity and pressure gradients only ) .",
    "toroidal topology of the fluid system introduces the main difference when compared with the physics of rotating stars ( for the latter , see a text - book exposition of the subject by tassoul @xcite ) . on large scales ,",
    "the accretion mechanism was proposed as the energy source in bright galactic nuclei in late 1960s ( lynden - bell @xcite ) . since then",
    "the idea has been continuously developed and brought to a text - book level .",
    "self - gravity has global consequences on the disc shape , namely , it influences the location of its inner and outer edges , as well as the disc geometrical thickness .",
    "the effect can be roughly parameterised by the ratio of the disc mass to the central bh mass , @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "wilson @xcite speculated about the importance of self - gravity ( especially in cataclysmic binary systems ) , which would have direct observational consequences , but this possibility was later rejected on the basis of more detailed arguments ; it turns out that non - standard ( massive ) discs are ruled out in cataclysmic binaries @xcite .",
    "self - gravity is normally unimportant in binary star systems also because their discs have limited space to occupy . under typical conditions ( i.e.  among well - known cosmic systems ) , the disc mass plays a role in the process of gradual fragmentation of proto - planetary nebulae , formation of planetary bodies , and their subsequent migration .",
    "( recent observations , in particular with the hubble space telescope , have demonstrated that discs are a by - product of star formation and also present during the birth of planets . )",
    "also planetary rings are subject of self - gravitational instabilities  but we can not tackle all these lively topics here ( see @xcite ) .",
    "there has been a recent interest in high - density ( neutron ) tori , in which case the disc own gravity must be important .",
    "this kind of massive discs could be formed in the course of binary star coalescence or as a product of collapse to a bh @xcite .",
    "the question of stability and time evolution of these heavy , transient tori is essential .",
    "the idea was advanced in the framework of scenarios of failed supernovae and strongly magnetised tori @xcite , and an interesting possibility of intermittent accretion was hypothesised in the context of massive neutron tori that may be formed from a tidally disrupted compact star @xcite .",
    "as mentioned above , gravitational field of heavy discs influences the global structure of the system , which in turn determines possible figures of equilibrium .",
    "coming back to accretion discs in galactic nuclei , vertical structure of these discs is affected by their self - gravity especially in the middle and the outer regions ( beyond a few hundreds @xmath4 , say ) where the vertical component of the disc gravitational field exceeds the corresponding @xmath5 component of the central field @xcite .",
    "the main aspect of discs non - negligible gravitational effect on their own structure concerns the stability with respect to perturbations .",
    "self - gravity was first examined in the context of accretion discs around super - massive black holes by paczyski @xcite , who proposed that local ( jeans - type ) self - gravitational instabilities are invoked if the density exceeds a threshold value .",
    "turbulent fragmentation may contribute to viscosity and to heating of the disc medium .",
    "even the formation of stars may be induced in this way @xcite .",
    "collin & zahn @xcite explored the possibility and the impact of star - formation in galactic - centre discs .",
    "recently , also sirko & goodman @xcite discussed consequences which the formation of massive stars in the disc may have on its heating and spectrum .",
    "non - axisymmetric instabilities of accretion discs and tori have been widely investigated ( see e.g.  @xcite and references cited therein ) .",
    "their importance for modelling realistic accretion discs has been soon recognised , but we do not examine these types of instability here . if one considers strictly axisymmetric and stationary rotational motion , one finds idealized configurations , which provide useful insight into the problem of accretion discs ; for example , the question of the role of mean stationary solutions .",
    "however , there is no doubt that these solutions must be rather different from real accretion flows ; investigations of the latter has culminated in recent three - dimensional numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "it is noteworthy here that we are allowed to treat both accretions discs in binary stars ( with an accreting stellar - mass black hole ) and in galactic nuclei , because common physical mechanisms operate in both cases .",
    "however , there are important distinctions which become particularly essential when realistic configurations are discussed .",
    "we will point out limitations of simple scaling between the two limiting cases later in the text , but great part of this paper concerns very simplified situations in which rough scaling according to the system size and mass is possible .    in the next section",
    "we summarize techniques that have been employed to derive spacetimes of gravitating discs around black holes within gr   framework and then we proceed to possible astrophysical applications of massive discs .",
    "we start the discussion by briefly recalling a uncomplicated case of a light non - self - gravitating newtonian disc that can be formed at a certain evolutionary stage of a binary star when the donor component dumps material on the other one .",
    "a text - book analysis of matter transfer employs the notion of roche potential in which the actual gravitational field of a binary is approximated by the field of two massive points orbiting around a common centre of mass @xcite ( see the left panel of figure  [ fig : v0 ] ) .",
    "an accretion disc forms when the donor fills its roche lobe and starts overflow near the lagrange l@xmath6 point .",
    "the gas transferred in this way possesses high angular momentum and creates a disc - like structure before being captured by the accreting body .",
    "the roche model gives a basic classification of binary stars into three main categories according to the sizes of individual components : detached , semi - detached and contact systems . as mentioned above , their discs",
    "can usually be treated as non - gravitating .",
    "in contrast to this transparent scheme , a sufficiently massive disc could change the potential field near the cusp . in the right panel of figure",
    "[ fig : v0 ] , distortion of equipotential surfaces is depicted with the disc contribution to the gravitational field taken into account ( here , the disc mass is comparable to that of the secondary star ) .",
    "it is relevant to remark that equilibria of relativistic tori also show the structure of critical lobes , which is similar to the roche geometry , even if the fluid is non - self - gravitating and the only source of gravity is the central black hole ( see section  [ testfluid ] ) .",
    "this structure facilitates accretion onto the central body .",
    "equilibrium figures of critical ( lobe - filling ) tori represent a starting point for the discussion of accreting black holes in compact binary systems .",
    "naturally , the roche lobe geometry is applicable for the mass overflow onto a black hole as much as it is in other systems of close binaries , in which the mass is exchanged between the components . however , topologically similar configurations of critical tori can arise also when accretion proceeds onto an isolated black hole . in this case",
    "the torus can develop a cusp and the overflow for a purely relativistic reason .",
    "the latter situation is particularly important for accretion onto super - massive bhs in galactic nuclei .",
    "an issue of global stability of such configurations must be raised : if a small amount of material is transferred through the inner cusp onto the central body , then a new , modified distribution of mass and of angular momentum is established .",
    "geometrical shape of the critical equilibrium is changed accordingly .",
    "a question arises whether the new configuration is stable or whether , instead , it undergoes further accretion in a catastrophically increasing ( runaway ) rate .",
    "abramowicz @xcite claimed the presence of this kind of instability in pseudo - newtonian massive tori , while wilson @xcite demonstrated that mass - less tori ( i.e.  test fluid ) around a kerr bh are not run - away unstable .",
    "answer to the problem of this instability depends on the radial distribution of angular momentum throughout the initial configuration ( before the mass exchange takes place ) and , in the relativistic case , also on bh angular momentum parameter .",
    "it was demonstrated that increasing bh rotation and a positive slope of the angular momentum distribution both have a stabilizing effect @xcite .",
    "increasing @xmath7 , on the other hand , acts against stability @xcite .",
    "comparisons @xcite are not easy because different approaches have been employed in papers ( numerical techniques vs.  analytical calculations ; proper gr  treatments vs.  approximations and pseudo - newtonian models ) . the black - hole ",
    "disc systems are difficult to treat exactly , even in the test - fluid approximation .",
    "severe simplifications have thus been imposed on theoretical models , ranging from presumed symmetries and boundary conditions to various assumptions about microphysics of the medium . simplifying",
    "assumptions are the more unavoidable when the disc gravity ( playing a role of the external source to the gravitational field ) can _ not _ be neglected and when one intends to proceed analytically .",
    "further restrictions are dictated by applicability of the results to real cosmic objects .",
    "there are at least three aspects in which the system of a rotating black hole with an external source attracts relativists .",
    "first , due to the non - linearity of einstein s equations , the field of a multi - body system is a traditional challenge where , in most cases , one does not manage with a simple superposition . on the first post - newtonian level , the `` celestial mechanics '' of gravitationally",
    "interacting bodies can be kept linear ( see damour @xcite ) , but in the strong - field regime the interaction may bring surprising features that have only been described in very few cases yet ( for a two - body problem , the current `` state of art '' is the third post - newtonian approximation @xcite ) .    the second point concerns manifestation of frame dragging due to the rotation of the sources .",
    "contrary to the newtonian treatment ( that does not discriminate directly between static and stationary situations ) , the relativistic field is determined not only by mass - energy configuration , but also by its motion within the bodies : the inertial space can loosely be imagined as a viscous fluid mixed by the sources . in today",
    "s `` gravito - electromagnetic '' language : gravity has not only an electric component , generated by the mass , but also a magnetic one , generated by mass currents @xcite .",
    "let us only refer to somewhat casual selection @xcite for further details at this point .",
    "needless to say , the third point is the presence of a bh itself .",
    "near such an extreme body , the deviations from newtonian theory become dominant ; in particular , the above mentioned implications of non - linearity and rotation reveal themselves prominently .",
    "the class of stationary axisymmetric solutions of einstein equations is the appropriate framework for the attempts to include the gravitational effect of an `` external '' source in an exact analytical manner . at the same time , such spacetimes are of obvious astrophysical importance , as they describe the exterior of a body in equilibrium @xcite ( see @xcite for thorough expositions on stationary and axially symmetric spacetimes in general relativity ) .    in the weyl ",

    "the superpositions of a schwarzschild bh with ( inverted ) `` higher '' morgan ",
    "morgan counter - rotating discs were studied in @xcite .",
    "comparison of the results obtained for the first ten of them showed that the properties of the disc are very sensitive to the local density profile .",

    "we have already explored one different family of annular disc solutions , namely , the case when density is a power - law in weyl radius , @xmath175 however , these discs also turned out not to be regular at the rim ; @xmath176-st radial derivative of their potential diverges , although all the radial derivatives of density are finite there , and the first @xmath177 derivatives even vanish . in a different context of galactic stellar discs ,",

    ", one has to reduce the generality of the problem elsewhere . whereas test discs are treated within stationary axisymmetric settings , analytical solutions with exact inclusion of the ambient material",
    "have only been studied in more detail in static cases yet .",
    "this is of course a serious limitation , because the collapsed cores of galaxies as well as ultra - compact components in binaries are likely to rotate , perhaps very rapidly , which means that inertial dragging should be important there in addition to the effects of pure scalar attraction .",
    "moreover , the composite spacetimes presented in the literature are constructed with discs whose field can be expressed in a tractable form rather than with those which really follow from some model of accretion .",
    "however , some superpositions  such as e.g.  those involving thin annular discs obtained by inversion of the morgan  morgan solutions @xcite  were shown to possess physically acceptable properties within an astrophysically plausible range of parameters .",
    "as such , they can indicate some of the effects that could occur as a consequence of non - negligible gravitational contribution of the disc ( see @xcite for a more thorough survey ) .",
    "let us return to the linear problem ( lax pair of linear equations ) associated with the ernst equation . in order to control",
    "the physical properties of the solution being constructed , it is desirable to translate the physical boundary conditions of the ernst equation into the language of quantities which appear in the linear problem and then solve the latter ( rather than to apply a `` random '' bcklund transformation to some metric @xcite ) .",

    "[ testfluid ] the limit case should be briefly mentioned when gravitation of the external matter is ignored and the central rotating bh fully determines the field",
    ". then the spacetime geometry is described by kerr metric and the equilibrium configurations can be found analytically @xcite , at least if the fluid obeys a simple equation of state ( such as a barytropic relation ) and remains in dynamical equilibrium with purely rotational motion ( four - velocity @xmath178 ) .",
    "this case is over - simplified from the astrophysical point of view , but it captures several crucial relativistic effects which do not occur in the newtonian limit  namely , the possibility of fluid overflow across the inner edge , which acts , effectively , as the lagrange l@xmath6 point in a binary system .",
    "the relativistic euler equation can be integrated in terms of specific enthalpy , @xmath179 , which can be further expressed as a function of @xmath180 , the profile of angular momentum density @xcite .",

    "the fluid can establish a stationary configuration provided that the @xmath184-isosurface is closed ( see figure  [ fig : w0 ] ) , otherwise overflow and subsequent accretion take place .",
    "let us recall that equilibrium configurations with their elongated cross - section ( bounded by the critical , self - crossing lobe ) _ resemble _ the shape of roche lobes .",
    "the possibility of fluid transport across the cusp occurs when the critical lobe is filled ; accretion can thus proceed without a necessary action of viscosity . however , the two situations are of very different nature . in the former case ,",
    "it is the combined gravitational effect of the binary together with ( newtonian ) centrifugal force which define the lobes , while , in the latter case , the only source of gravity is the central body with relativistic effects playing a crucial role .",
    "compared with the vacuum case ( with a bh but without a disc ) , modifications of the observable characteristics can be linked with the presence of self - gravitating matter .",
    "various approaches have been adopted in order to construct solutions and discuss motion in the gravitational field of black - hole discs .",
    "one can start , e.g. , by constructing equilibrium structures of self - gravitating polytropic thick discs @xcite .",
    "formalism was developed also for perturbative solution of a ( slowly rotating , weakly gravitating , geometrically thin ) ring around a schwarzschild bh @xcite .",

    "different variants of the pseudo - newtonian potential were proposed in order to include rotation of the bh and to obtain better agreement with relativity ( see @xcite for references ) .",
    "the pseudo - newtonian potential does not aspire to represent any gravitational theory , and the corresponding potential is not required to satisfy any field equations .",
    "this fact , however , does not diminish the practical value of the model , which applies even to regions with strong gravity and captures qualitative features of motion near the horizon . ]",
    "the accretion - disc self - induced field was also discussed in connection with the disc s vertical structure and stability .",
    "it turns out that certain modes of instability can be damped whereas others are amplified by the disc s gravity @xcite .",
    "fully relativistic results employ numerical spacetimes @xcite . within these solutions ,",
    "the computation of emission - line profiles were performed ; the case of moderately massive thin finite discs was treated by @xcite , and that of heavy toroids by @xcite . , but also in terms of physical measures  circumferential radius @xmath187 and proper radial distance from the horizon . ]",
    "another issue is the oscillation of the disc material excited by a small perturbation in the horizontal ( @xmath24 and @xmath16 ) or vertical ( @xmath5 ) direction @xcite . in the static case ,",
    "the formulae for the frequencies of free horizontal and vertical oscillations give @xcite @xmath188 @xmath189.\\ ] ] without the external source , @xmath190 reduces to the square of the schwarzschild orbital frequency , @xmath191 , whereas @xmath192 remains different due to the pericentre precession .",
    "it was found that perturbations in the horizontal direction are more important for the stability of light discs , whereas the vertical perturbations are more dangerous for heavy discs : for superpositions of the given type , the curve of marginal vertical stability is more restrictive than that of marginal horizontal stability for @xmath193 .",
    "it even fully excludes discs with @xmath194 @xcite .",
    "disc self - gravity makes oscillations of the inner parts faster and the region of the horizontal mode trapping somewhat smaller",
    ".    when the black hole and the disc are allowed to rotate , manifestations of self - gravity could be even more pronounced , because in relativity the kinetic energy ( as well as any other form of energy ) also generates the field .",
    "corresponding mass - energy currents give rise to frame dragging .",
    "_ whereas the mass of the black hole is probably dominant in a real accretion system , the disc can bear much of the angular momentum , thus modifying the gravito - magnetic field of the central object significantly .",
    "_ this could be decisive for the mechanisms of rotational energy extraction .",
    "note , however , also the possibility of having accreting systems where the disc / torus mass can actually be comparable to that of the central black hole and which can represent a transient state of gravitational collapse . in this context ,",
    "the most popular system is a close binary of ultra - compact objects .",
    "late evolutionary stages of such systems ( in - spiral , merger and the ring - down phase ) and the fate of debris have been studied , numerically and perturbatively , as a tentative source of gravitational waves ( see @xcite and references therein ) and also as an engine behind gamma - ray bursts @xcite . in particular , at late stages of the neutron star ",
    "black hole binary in - spiral , the neutron star could tidally break up @xcite .",
    "two - dimensional toroidal shapes similar to the one shown in figure [ fig : w0 ] were originally invented mainly as a model for large and very diluted flows which probably exist in quasars and similar objects .",
    "these considerations have been continuously refined and discussed in various context ( recently , e.g.  @xcite and references cited therein ) . as mentioned above , already in early works",
    "it was recognised that self - gravity imposes limits on this scheme and should be taken into account in calculations .",
    "self - gravity is also relevant for a recently proposed idea @xcite that non - stationary tori could be formed in accreting binaries .",
    "a relatively small size and steep pressure gradients of these configurations put them in a corner of parameter space where they may show high - frequency quasi - periodic oscillations @xcite , which makes them very attractive to astronomers , but formation of such structures still needs to be addressed .",
    "from the point of view of gravitational theory , and also for the nature of the accretion flow , the most important part is the inner region near to the bh .",
    "however , the gravitational field of actual discs has substantial and even , possibly , dominant influence on their structure also at large distances ( exceeding several @xmath195 ; in physical units , @xmath196 cm ) where the self - gravity is comparable to the central field .",
    "newtonian physics is sufficient at those distances . the importance of the disc self - gravity is often checked by toomre s parameter , @xmath197 : the local stability criterion with respect to axially symmetric perturbations requires @xmath198 @xcite ( @xmath199 is a local sound speed ) .",
    "spiral structures may be produced already at @xmath200@xmath201 .",
    "depending on the radial distribution of the thermodynamic quantities , global instabilities can indeed occur and play a key role in enhancing the accretion rate @xcite .",
    "( of course , at this point one must recall the theories of galactic dynamics @xcite . )",
    "this may facilitate angular momentum transport and provide a feeding mechanism for central black holes @xcite .",
    "again , we concentrate on discs in galactic nuclei although similar mechanisms are relevant also for discs around stellar - mass black holes and , to a certain degree , even for circumstellar discs in star - forming regions .",
    "in addition to the classical equations of mass , momentum and energy conservation , the description of newtonian gravitating fluids must include poisson s equation , @xmath202 which links the mass density distribution @xmath203 in the disc and the self - gravitating potential @xmath204 ( @xmath205 refers to the source and @xmath206 is the field point ) .",
    "to understand the signatures of self - gravity expected in the fluid structure and motion , one can consider a purely rotating , steady - state system with zero viscosity and no significant radial pressure gradient .",
    "the radial component of the euler equation ( in cylindrical coordinates ) is then : @xmath207 . in the absence of rotation ,",
    "steady solutions are forbidden and the fluid falls towards the centre in a short time scale .",
    "free fall can be avoided thanks to the centrifugal term which compensates the total gravitational attraction @xmath208 .",
    "if radial self - gravity is unimportant , that is if @xmath209 , then rotation of the fluid is determined by the bh mass only , @xmath210 .",
    "this assumption underlies most disc models in astrophysics .",
    "in particular , newtonian geometrically thin disc models fall within this category @xcite . in the opposite situation ,",
    "it is evident from the simple form of euler s equation that , as the disc carries some mass , angular velocity is expected to increase in order to prevent accretion .",
    "this implies that ( radially ) self - gravitating discs are expected to rotate faster than non - self - gravitating ones .    from the previous estimate",
    "one can conclude that heavy ( fluid ) discs should exhibit a super - keplerian rotation curve ( in terms of @xmath211 ) .",
    "keplerian rotation could still be maintained in a self - gravitating disc , but this would be a surprising result of some fine tuning among various quantities  pressure gradients , advection of momentum , effects of turbulent transport , etc .",
    "neither can the possibility of sub - keplerian rotation be ruled out .",
    "such a case could occur in the outermost disc regions if @xmath212 , for instance due to the presence of a dense region near the edge or due to significant negative pressure gradients .",
    "further , viscous stresses can switch the accretion .",
    "let us now analyse the vertical component of the euler equation in the same idealized situation as described above ( again in the newtonian limit ) : @xmath213 .",
    "this is hydrostatic equilibrium in @xmath5-direction which tells us that central gravity acts against pressure gradients and tends to gather material around the equatorial plane of the disc . for a bare central point mass ,",
    "the magnitude of the vertical component of gravity decreases with radius . as an inevitable consequence",
    ", the disc tends to ` flare ' ( its thickness being roughly proportional to the distance from the axis , or even steeper , and it can wildly oscillate in the vertical direction ) .",
    "the atmosphere of the disc ( i.e.  its less dense region away from the equatorial plane ) gets thicker where the gravity is weaker .",
    "the geometrical semi - thickness of the disc then satisfies the relation @xmath214 .",
    "models show such flaring in the non - self - gravitating regime .",
    "regarding the vertical direction , the disc self - gravity is significant if @xmath215 . for any fluid element this results in enhancement of the vertical gravity ; thus , a vertically self - gravitating disc should be geometrically thinner and more dense than a non - self - gravitating one . as will be shown below",
    ", some accretion disc models even yield @xmath216 in those regions , so in these circumstances the disc thickness can not exceed a certain limiting value .",
    "this is important for the disc irradiation ( and self - irradiation ) .",
    "some fundamental properties of discs and tori can be understood in the apparently simple framework of maclaurin spheroid theory .",
    "early analytical investigations by poincar , dyson and , later , by chandrasekhar @xcite have been supplemented with recent numerical investigations ( hachisu @xcite ) .",
    "these works shed light on possible shapes and dynamical characteristics of steady , self - gravitating polytropes in the inviscid limit .",
    "both axially and non - axially symmetrical equilibrium patterns have been discussed .",
    "it turns out that equilibrium sequences can describe any conceivable system ( depending on the polytropic index of the gas ) : these include multiple star systems , tri - axial ( jacobi ) ellipsoids , some very strange shapes ( ` pear ' , ` amonit ' , etc . ) , but also discs , tori and rings . in the case of global solid - body rotation , discs , tori , and rings",
    "occupy the bottom - right part in the usual diagram of rotation frequency versus angular momentum . furthermore , in a recent paper by ansorg @xcite a sequence of compressible rings is investigated with high precision .",
    "a bifurcation occurs from the maclaurin sequence to the multi - ring sequence .",
    "what remains to be explored is the case of a full multi - ring sequence and its limit for the number of rings approaching infinity .",
    "an interesting connection could appear with the theory of disc fragmentation into individual rings @xcite .",
    "the theory of maclaurin spheroids and rings is built from simple arguments and is fundamental for understanding the problem of gravitating discs , but it still needs to be enriched with other physical ingredients .",
    "disc modelling poses a difficult task even in the newtonian regime .",
    "in addition to the technical embarrassment of solving the poisson equation with sufficient accuracy , difficulties are connected with strong coupling between magnetohydrodynamic terms and radiative transfer in the medium , and with our ignorance of boundary and initial conditions ( they can not be sufficiently constrained by observations but are decisive for the evolution of flows ) .",
    "furthermore , huge values of the reynolds number ( typically @xmath217 ) are associated with accretion flows . in consequence",
    ", simulations do not currently reach the numerical resolution required to investigate simultaneously both the large - scale streams and the smallest swirls where kinetic energy is dissipated .",
    "this is another reason why ( magneto-)hydrodynamical simulations of accretion flows should be interpreted with caution @xcite .",
    "despite the tremendous complexity of these problems , models and simulations have reached a fair level of credibility @xcite .",
    "thermal equilibrium of the disc and its possible fragmentation have been also explored @xcite .    given the technical obstacles inherent in the problem",
    ", disc modellers often resort to a semi - phenomenological parameterisation of the turbulent transport by using a viscosity coefficient of the form @xmath218 , where @xmath219 is the disc half - thickness and @xmath220 is a parameter .",
    "the @xmath221-parameterisation , originally advocated in the context of binary accretion discs by shakura & sunyaev @xcite , remains a recipe enabling study of the characteristics of a mean accretion flow at the lowest level of approximation .",
    "however , it does not explain the process of triggering and maintaining the turbulence .",
    "other viscosity laws have been proposed , for instance the @xmath2-prescription which is based on analogy with turbulence observed in laboratory sheared flows and gives @xmath222 @xcite . also , there is the prescription of marginally stable ( @xmath223 ) discs with @xmath224 , designed for weakly ( locally ) self - gravitating discs @xcite .",
    "very probably turbulent transport and its effects can not be satisfactorily mimicked through simple prescriptions .",
    "below we touch on several properties which can be derived from the classical @xmath221-prescription , as well as the properties of @xmath223 discs . given the current knowledge , one can not decide which of these approximations is better .",
    "association of the density field @xmath225 with a prescribed newtonian potential is straightforward and always possible .",
    "various classes of density  potential pairs can be formed @xcite . unfortunately , the reverse procedure , i.e.  the inversion of poisson s equation , is difficult in general .",
    "no analytically tractable expression is available for @xmath204 that would correspond to a general three - dimensional system of finite size and mass .",
    "exact solutions corresponding to non - spherical systems can not be written generally in a closed form if the matter distribution is two - dimensional , non - homogeneous or of non - trivial shape or topology .",
    "astrophysical discs exhibit all three complications .",
    "as an illustration we show first , in figure  [ fig : map ] ( left panel ) , the density distribution in the standard disc model where self - gravity effects are _ not _ included @xcite .",
    "the complexity of shape and density distribution is striking : discs appear to be complex objects for which the merit of special analytical ( and especially self - similar ) solutions is very limited or doubtful .",
    "an alternative approach is to consider the integral definition for the potential , @xmath226 and to use expansions of green s function ( for instance in cylindrical harmonics or another kind of equivalent infinite series representation ) .",
    "this approach is often employed in order to find self - similar solutions and to investigate the disc stability @xcite . however , as pointed out in @xcite , convergence of the series is not guaranteed in all points of matter distribution .",
    "also , the expansion leads to uncertainties because the inferred series must be truncated .    in order to be able to treat realistic systems",
    ", one has to seek numerical solutions .",
    "however , it is difficult to achieve sufficient computational accuracy using standard techniques . why is this ?",
    "the first reason is that no boundary conditions are available in the vicinity of the disc ; instead , they can be imposed only at infinity ( @xmath227 for @xmath81 ) .",
    "secondly , the physical boundary of the fluid is not known _ a priori _ and it can evolve with time .",
    "one can not rely on the standard situation that is met within laboratory physics of a fluid confined within walls , in which case the boundary conditions are imposed by experimental settings .",
    "the third difficulty is caused by the relatively large and variable aspect ratio : @xmath228 may be as large as unity and even greater at some parts of the disc , and as low as @xmath229 at other places ( cf .  figure  [ fig : map ] ) .",
    "this fact hinders discussion of discs in active galactic nuclei , where the geometrical thickness of the disc can vary wildly over its diameter .",
    "there are two practical ways of solving the problem numerically @xcite .",
    "the first one employs straightforward determination of the potential from equation ( [ eq : poisson - integ ] ) everywhere in the disc .",
    "this approach can be very accurate if one is able to cope with integrable singularities inside the source ( @xmath230 ) and it can account for very distorted disc shapes and large density gradients . however , the computations involved are generally very time consuming .",
    "one can envisage some cell - based technique @xcite ( as done in particle simulations @xcite ) , but this is not expected to reach high precision ( which is necessary for stability analysis ) .",
    "another possibility is to invert equation ( [ eq : poisson ] ) using a finite difference method or a finite element method @xcite .",
    "this approach requires that boundary conditions can be obtained through equation ( [ eq : poisson - integ ] ) .",
    "finally , it is worth noting that the inversion of poisson s equation for rotating stars can be performed via the mapping technique , e.g.  transformation of space coordinates @xcite . to our knowledge , the mapping technique has never been used for discs .",
    "since the efficient numerical computation of the potential is not trivial , people still seek approximate semi - analytical approaches that would complement purely numerical solutions and make them faster .",
    "this is in particular the case for the infinite slab ( is ) approximation , which was introduced by paczyski and collaborators in the late 1970s in a series of papers devoted to marginally stable discs @xcite . in this approach",
    "the disc is examined in @xmath231-plane , imposing axial symmetry and omitting the radial and azimuthal terms in equation ( [ eq : poisson ] ) .",
    "the poisson equation then reads @xmath232 the main advantage of equation ( [ eq : psiisa ] ) is the possibility of determining the magnitude of the vertical gravity by direct integration along the vertical direction . in this way",
    "even a full solution @xmath233 could apparently be found .",
    "the vertical field is given by @xmath234 where @xmath235 is half of the local surface density .",
    "this result is exact if the system is invariant under any translation perpendicular to @xmath5-axis , and for this the disc must be ( i )  of infinite size , ( ii )  strictly flat ( its geometrical thickness @xmath236 is constant ) and ( iii )  homogeneous in the radial direction ( vertical gradients can be non - zero in the direction of @xmath5-axis ) .",
    "obviously , such properties are not realistic , but the validity of the is  approximation can be extended to radially inhomogeneous , finite size discs with non - constant thickness , provided that the condition @xmath237 is satisfied .",
    "it is not generally possible to check inequality ( [ eq : isaextended ] ) for a given configuration because the `` true '' potential @xmath204 is not known or is difficult to compute with sufficient accuracy ( for the technical reasons mentioned above ) .",
    "also , the above - described way of getting @xmath233 can not be used to estimate the radial component of the field .",
    "it is worth noting that equation ( [ eq : gzisa ] ) holds regardless of the relative masses of the disc and the central object , making the is  approximation often very useful ( for example , it can be used to compute massive non - keplerian discs ) , but it is also important to know where this powerful approximation fails .",
    "although the potential is a global function , we can determine this by considering its local properties by expressing @xmath238 .",
    "inequality ( [ eq : isaextended ] ) is violated in regions where @xmath239 or , in terms of density gradients , when @xmath240    for a reasonable density stratification and attractive potential , we expect @xmath241 and @xmath242 .",
    "this implies that the isapproximation may break down when ( i )  @xmath243 , which corresponds to discs and tori of moderate and large aspect ratios , and/or ( ii ) the radial and vertical density gradients are of the same order .",
    "this applies if density waves or shocks with steep fronts are present , especially in boundary layers or close to the disc edges .",
    "the flatter is the disc , the weaker are the edge effects .    an interesting property of vertical stratification can be derived directly from the is  approximation @xcite .",
    "if the disc is able to reach hydrostatic equilibrium , then the total pressure gradient compensates total gravity .",
    "differentiating equation of hydrostatic balance relative to @xmath5 gives @xmath244 + 4\\pi { } \\rho = 0 .",
    "\\label{eq : hydro}\\ ] ] this equation becomes independent of the radius in the limit of a disc that stays in vertical equilibrium under its own gravity .",
    "an analytical solution can be obtained assuming polytropic relation @xmath245 ( @xmath199 is a speed , @xmath246 is polytropic index ) .",
    "the above - given equation is analogy of the famous hydrostatic equilibrium problem for gaseous spheres in equilibrium .",
    "the resulting `` plane '' lane ",
    "emden equation writes @xcite @xmath247 for vertically isothermal structure with @xmath248 , the equation ( [ eq : ple - polytrope ] ) is the frank  kamnetski equation @xcite @xmath249 and the solution is @xcite @xmath250 where @xmath251 is the isothermal sound speed and @xmath252 is the mid - plane density . from equation ( [ eq : sigmadef ] ) , the surface density of the self - gravitating disc is given by @xmath253 @xcite , and thus the disc mass depends solely on the radial distribution of central pressure @xmath254 .",
    "discussion of solutions for various polytropic indices can be found in @xcite .",
    "the issue is that , as the polytropic index @xmath246 runs from infinity ( in the isothermal case ) to smaller values , the vertical density profile tends to be flatter . in the limit @xmath255 ,",
    "this profile becomes exactly rectangular in shape .",
    "figure  [ fig : rhoz ] shows the density profile in the direction perpendicular to the disc plane in a typical disc .",
    "the isothermal case is also shown for comparison .",
    "models of the disc vertical stratification are close to the models of stellar interiors and show that the vertical structure is not isothermal and can not be modelled by a polytrope ( with @xmath256 ) , at least not if the disc is optically thick .",
    "discs are heated by turbulent motion and this results in a very complex vertical stratification of physical quantities .          in many respects it would be useful for the disc modelling if the degree of self - gravity were indicated by an unmistakable criterion .",
    "as a relevant quantity , one can intuitively suggest the mass ratio @xmath257 @xmath258 , where @xmath259 is the cumulative mass of the disc and @xmath260 is a half of the local surface density according to equation ( [ eq : sigmadef ] ) .",
    "one might postulate that self - gravity is unimportant for @xmath261 , say .",
    "note that , in a binary system , the @xmath257-value ( defined as the mass ratio of the two stars ) is critical in the definition of the roche lobes .",
    "however , such a criterion is unreliable to explore an extended disc in its close neighbourhood , where it can not be reduced to a point mass .",
    "we show below that the right criterion is based on the quantity @xmath262 which contains information about the disc mass ( relative to the central black hole ) as well as about the distribution of the mass density in space ( in terms of the aspect ratio ) .    the ratio @xmath263 can be evaluated provided that the vertical component of the disc self - gravity is known . for @xmath264 ,",
    "the disc and the central body contribute comparably to the field along @xmath5-axis ( this case is referred as the `` weak self - gravitating limit '' , wsg  hereafter ) .",
    "as soon as @xmath265 exceeds unity , the disc is _ vertically _ self - gravitating . within the is  approximation , @xmath266 is given by equation ( [ eq : gzisa ] ) , so one obtains @xmath267 .",
    "when the gas remains confined within altitudes @xmath268 , we can use the mid - plane value @xmath269 where @xmath270 is the mass density in @xmath74 , as defined in the absence of self - gravity .",
    "the role of parameter @xmath271 was discussed in @xcite ; taylor expansion around @xmath74 shows that the mid - plane value of @xmath265 can be identified with @xmath61-parameter of paczyski @xcite .",
    "one finds that the upper limit for the disc height is typically @xmath272 ; such discs stand on a borderline beyond which the approximation of geometrically thin discs becomes very crude and inadequate .",
    "we notice that vertical self - gravity occurs preferentially ( i )  when the central bh has a small mass , ( ii )  if the local mass density in the disc is large , and ( iii )  at rather large distances from the centre .",
    "if the surface density obeys a power - law in radius , for instance in the form @xmath273 , then @xmath274 relation ( [ eq : zetac ] ) shows that even low - mass discs can be self - gravitating if they are flat enough .",
    "we can put numbers in this relation : given that standard discs in active galaxies have a power index @xmath275 and small , almost constant aspect ratio , @xmath276 , we find @xmath277 @xcite .",
    "( the adopted value of @xmath278 corresponds to the outer , gas - pressure dominated region ; another value would not change qualitative conclusions at this point . ) in other words , a disc becomes vertically self - gravitating when its relative mass exceeds a small threshold value .",
    "this value is model dependent ; typically it is order of a few @xmath279 .",
    "note that the limit is much less than the crude estimate of @xmath280 suggested before .    by introducing ratio @xmath281",
    "one can follow the same kind of analysis for the radial component of gravity .",
    "a disc is _ radially _ self - gravitating if @xmath282 , hence this regime can be referred to as a strongly self - gravitating ( ssg ) disc .",
    "conclusions are less straightforward in this case because we lack sufficiently reliable expression for @xmath283 . in other words , there is no obvious analogy to the is  approximation . some authors @xcite have proposed that the total potential can be approximated by the monopole term , @xmath284 , which is not fully satisfactory but gives at least the right order of magnitude in the ssg  limit ( @xmath285 ) . considering , as above , a power law for the radial surface density profile ,",
    "@xmath286 is given by @xmath287 in the equatorial plane .",
    "using equation ( [ eq : zetac ] ) , we find @xmath288 ( the case of @xmath289 can be derived in similar manner ) .",
    "the ssg  regime corresponds to @xmath290 using the above values for @xmath278 and @xmath228 , @xmath291 corresponds to @xmath292 , well above the wsglimit . as @xmath293 is expected to be an increasing function of radius , the ssg  limit involves more mass and",
    "is reached at larger radii than the weak limit .",
    "it therefore lies inside the vertically self - gravitating discs .",
    "this value is in good agreement with the results established by lantian & xiaoci @xcite who have attempted to performed a direct , analytical integration of equation ( [ eq : poisson - integ ] ) .",
    "although their investigation still contains some rough approximations ( for instance , singularities in the poisson kernel were artificially removed ) , these authors derived a formula for radial self - gravity which accounts for finite size effects . for @xmath294",
    ", they found radial acceleration to be @xmath295 ,   \\label{eq : lantian}\\ ] ] which sets the ssg  limit at @xmath296 ( assuming the eddington accretion rate ; see figure  [ fig : map ] right ) .",
    "note that this formula still remains singular at the disc edge @xcite . to circumvent the difficulty , a softening parameter is often introduced @xcite , however , correct behaviour can be obtained just by careful treatment of edges .",
    "results discussed so far have not yet addressed the essential questions concerning the gravitational stability of self - gravitating , geometrically thin discs .",
    "it is known for long , and confirmed by observations , that galaxies ( treated as discs of stars , gas and dust ) are regulated by self - gravity @xcite .",
    "similar processes can form spirals and bar patterns in purely gaseous discs .",
    "it was shown in a remarkable paper by goldreich & lynden - bell @xcite that instability sets in when @xmath297 where the lower limit , @xmath298 , depends on polytropic index @xmath246 ( the value of @xmath299 corresponds to a vertically isothermal disc , while @xmath300 for @xmath301 ) .",
    "note that this is an analogy of toomre s original criterion , but with a slightly different threshold @xcite .",
    "it is important to recall that goldreich & lynden - bell s criterion has been established from an analysis of growing unstable modes through a linear perturbation theory , within the framework of is  approximation and assuming a non - viscous , uniformly rotating , flat disc .",
    "it is therefore expected to be somewhat altered when relaxing some of the above assumptions .",
    "it is easy to recognise that equation ( [ ineq : glb ] ) also gives @xmath302 .",
    "we thus conclude that instabilities are not present in a disc if its size remains below the weak limit .",
    "the region separating the weak , the unstable and the strong limit can be narrow or wide , depending on the surface density profile ; or , more precisely , on the function @xmath303 .",
    "again , a very nice example is provided by saturn s rings which are vertically self - gravitating at their outer edge , but gravitationally stable , implying that the weak limit and the unstable limit do not coincide .      according to equation ( [ eq : zeta ] )",
    ", an increase of the @xmath265-parameter is expected as the radius increases .",
    "this means that there is a boundary zone that separates the inner ( non - self - gravitating ) solution from the outer ( self - gravitating ) one .",
    "the location of this zone can be found without accounting for self - gravity , simply by computing @xmath265 from a disc model @xcite .",
    "this approach may underestimate the magnitude of self - gravity and overestimate the radius of such boundary , but it provides a useful order of magnitude estimate .",
    "a more reliable result must include vertical self - gravity into consideration .",
    "this can be achieved within the is  approximation .",
    "furthermore , in the context of @xmath221-prescription , the wsg  limit is reached at @xmath304 . for accretion rates lower than a certain critical value , @xmath305",
    ", one finds @xcite @xmath306 while @xmath307 for accretion rates larger than @xmath308 ; here , @xmath309 is expressed in schwarzschild radii , and the critical accretion rate is expressed in solar masses per year , @xmath310/yr ( @xmath311 is opacity ) .",
    "noticeable deviations are observed when considering temperature- and density - dependent opacities and equation of state ( not yet specified self - consistently in equations ( [ eq : rsg1])([eq : rsg2 ] ) ) .",
    "the existence of two different relations arises from the fact that bh discs generally possess an inner region ( dominated by radiation pressure ) and an outer ( gas pressure dominated ) region where the physical quantities ( namely , the density ) exhibit different variations with radius and the accretion rate .",
    "the case ( [ eq : rsg2 ] ) corresponds approximately to accretion luminosity exceeding the eddington limit .",
    "figure [ fig : weaklimit ] gives a theoretical relationship between the location of wsg  limit and the accretion rate .",
    "it was computed by different authors using the @xmath221-prescription and the same input parameters ( relevant for accretion flows onto super - massive bhs in galactic nuclei ) .",
    "it is noticeable that no firm agreement has been achieved about the position of this limit , which largely fluctuates from one author to another simply because of different ingredients in models .",
    "also , there are no direct observations available to confirm if this wsg - transition operates in nature and if it occurs where predicted .",
    "however , in active galaxies there is a _ striking similarity _ between the location and size of the so - called broad - line region , and the value of @xmath312 .",
    "this correspondence could indicate that the clouds are formed at the distance where self - gravity becomes important ( cf .",
    "@xcite for a systematic discussion of the correlation ) . according to bi - dimensional calculations ,",
    "a lower ( reliable ) limit appears to be @xmath313 for a @xmath314 m@xmath315 central black hole and @xmath316 .",
    "this is only 5 milliparsecs from the centre , much less than previously estimated ( e.g.  @xcite ) .      of simple models that can be constructed analytically on the basis of @xmath221-parameterisation",
    ", we pay a special attention to those where self - gravity is taken into account in the vertical direction , while keplerian rotation is still imposed .",
    "this represents even a weaker category of wsg discs , because their rotation curve is assumed not to be altered by the disc mass . within this approach",
    ", the above - discussed infinite slab approximation has been found very convenient , although some criticism can be raised at this point , because these disc models typically tend to be rather massive .",
    "hence they become globally self - gravitating and no more keplerian ( this problem occurs especially if the surface density falls faster than the square of radius ) .",
    "paczyski s original paper @xcite was devoted to the investigation of discs with constant ratio of the vertical self - gravity to the vertical component of the central field , i.e. constant value of @xmath265-parameter ( i.e.  @xmath317 , which corresponds to @xmath61 in paczyski s notation ) .",
    "the assumption of vertical self - gravity is justified by the fact that strongly self - gravitating discs are prone to gravitational instabilities @xcite which should make them evolve in a couple of dynamical time scales ( @xmath318 ) .",
    "the endpoint of this evolution is the state of constant toomre s @xmath319-parameter , which is typical for differentially rotating discs of stars ( @xmath319 can be related to @xmath265 via equation ( [ eq : zeta ] ) ) .",
    "soon it was realized that holding @xmath320 might produce some substantial bias @xcite ; a series of papers followed to elucidate the local response of the disc to vertical self - gravity and to study @xmath321 profile .",
    "keplerian discs were investigated in which @xmath265 varies as a function of radius in a self - consistent fashion ( another motivation for this research was the chance of discovering new branches of solutions ) .",
    "most explorations were carried out for steady discs , using the so - called `` vertically averaged approximation '' , where one seeks only for radial profiles of density , temperature and other physical quantities ( without considering vertical stratification in detail ) . with additional assumptions about opacity , equation of state , pressure regime , etc .",

    ", vertical self - gravity makes the accreted gas more concentrated around the mid - plane . as a result",
    ", the disc tends to collapse in the vertical direction beyond some critical radius where @xmath322 ( cf .",
    "figures [ fig : map ] and [ fig : rhoz ] ) .",
    "this property is shared by all computations of geometrically thin discs , independently of the actual viscosity prescription ( in other words , if one assumes @xmath221-parameterisation for viscosity , then the disc height is almost independent of @xmath221 ) .",

    "these graphs are derived from basic arguments and they can help to identify physical mechanisms which are important from the observational point of view .",
    "time - scales relevant for the gravitationally unstable regions of accretion discs are shown as a function of radius ( in the left frame ) .",
    "the possibility of star formation was taken into account together with continuous migration and evolution in the medium ( here , @xmath350 was assumed for the central black hole ) .",
    "if the stars form a dense ( quasi - spherical ) nuclear cluster in which the central bh resides , one can define the radius where stars are destroyed tidally or by their mutual collisions .",
    "the resulting value depends on @xmath1 as well as details of the stellar structure ( as shown in the right frame ) .",
    "significant effort has been devoted to searching for black holes during the last few decades .",
    "traditionally , most approaches of present - day astronomy rely on the electromagnetic radiation coming from cosmic sources , but there are other possibilities which will be surely exploited in near future ( neutrinos , high - energy cosmic particles , and gravitational waves ) .",
    "the idea of detecting black holes via ( electromagnetic ) radiation of nearby luminous matter can be traced back to the celebrated lecture , which rev .",
    "john michell presented in front of the royal society as early as in 1783 .",
    "understanding local physics of the medium is crucial if one aims to interpret complex and variable spectra that are observed .",
    "x rays are particularly pertinent because they are produced near bh , as discussed by fabian and others @xcite .",
    "indeed , given the intrinsic emissivity of the medium , there are only a few factors determining the source spectrum on the earth .",
    "the main factor is the black hole mass @xmath1 ; the angular momentum of the black hole and the disc self - gravity play secondary roles .",
    "the geometrical optics approximation is thus adequate and one can hope to infer actual values of bh parameters from the motion of test matter around it .",
    "however , one has to be well aware of various environmental influences that hinder real observations .    under conditions that are thought to be typical in active galactic nuclei ,",
    "the inner regions of accretion flows contain diluted plasma with a corona threaded by magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "high - energy photons are first generated in the corona .",
    "these primary photons irradiate substantially colder gas of the accretion disc , where they are reprocessed further ( figure  [ fig : collin ] ) .",
    "a fraction of photons is reflected .",
    "the temperature of the reflecting medium can be @xmath351k in galactic nuclei and about 23 orders of magnitude higher in the case of galactic bh candidates @xcite .",
    "the quality of photon reprocessing depends critically on the ionization state and other local properties of the medium . in this way the resulting spectrum is formed with spectral features ( lines )",
    "superposed on top of the background continuum .",
    "x - ray spectra contain precious information about rapid flows from which one can infer properties of the central source of gravity and the state of the nearby gas .",
    "manifestation of strong gravity has been searched in radiation of accretion discs with the main aim of finding the evidence for the central black hole @xcite .",
    "majority of these papers deal with non - self - gravitating discs and assume that integrated light of the whole source is only very weakly affected by the disc gravitation ( however , see @xcite ) . in the case of our galactic centre ,",
    "the presence of standard - type ( thin ) accretion disc is rather improbable ( e.g.  narayan @xcite ) .",
    "direct effect of the disc gravity on spectral line profiles is below current observational resolution for any present - day spectra of active galactic nuclei , so it can be safely neglected in the first approximation ( we briefly discuss this effect in the following paragraph ) .",
    "it is noteworthy , however , that self - gravity of the disc has indirect impact on spectral features .",
    "first , as discussed in section  [ sec : astrophysical ] , the disc geometrical shape is affected by self - gravity with consequences for obscuration of some parts of the disc and the resulting variability , especially at large values of inclination ( this is also the case when gr effects of the central bh are maximal , so the two influences are mixed ) .",
    "self - gravity also controls the amount of disc self - irradiation , which produces indirect signs in reflected light .",
    "finally , self - gravity induces fragmentation in the disc medium ( depending in particular on the disc cooling properties @xcite ) with fundamental consequences on the disc structure .",
    "fragments can even lead to star formation or contribute to star - bursts @xcite .",
    "the clumpy material may also result in much more pronounced variability observed from the source @xcite .",
    "let us now discuss direct effects of the combined bh ",
    "disc gravity on observed light rays . in the early works of cunningham & bardeen @xcite ,",
    "a standard non - self - gravitating disc was assumed .",
    "these authors initiated a series of investigations of model spectra with the aim of revealing the imprints of gr .",
    "since then , many people have advanced various modifications of the original semi - analytical approach @xcite .",
    "very prominent role has been played by studies of spectral features ( lines ) of iron in the x - ray band ; in particular , the so called disc - line scheme has been widely applied , as it captures the main spectral characteristics attributed to strong gravity @xcite .",
    "the line is produced by reprocessing the primary continuum radiation near above the inner edge of the disc , within several tens of @xmath4 ( see @xcite for recent exposition of emission mechanisms ) .",
    "the line intrinsic width is small , typically much less than the final observed profile that results from integration over the whole emitting surface .",
    "standard picture of the disc thermal spectrum @xcite was reconsidered to account also for the disc gravity @xcite . for detailed examination it would be useful to produce templates of expected line profiles or even spectral models that are consistent with the formation of non - axially symmetric structures in accretion discs as well as the presence of a black hole in the centre @xcite .",
    "there is an exciting possibility of detecting gravitational effects on polarized light of a source orbiting a black hole , but this idea still awaits technology usable for its practical implementation @xcite .",
    "effects of the black hole itself on the light propagation are blurred in real sources in which the signal comes from different , insufficiently resolved regions .",
    "so far , only a few cases have been discovered of an accreting black hole with a line that attains the characteristic shape , width and variability and could be understood as the interplay of doppler and gravitational shifts .",
    "the best example of such spectral feature originating near a bh has been identified in the nucleus of seyfert galaxy mcg6 - 30 - 15 where the iron line was caught at the moment of high redshift @xcite .",
    "large gravitational redshift can be connected with rapid bh rotation , because the radius of the disc inner edge ( where the line presumably originates ) decreases with bh angular momentum increasing @xcite .",
    "magnetic fields can change this straightforward conclusion . also , the line is strongly variable , so its final ( continuum subtracted ) shape can not be resolved reliably with current knowledge ; but there is a good prospect of overpassing these deficiencies with more detailed models and using time - resolved spectroscopy that will be able to track rapid features @xcite .",
    "reconstruction of accretion disc images will then be doable using reverberation techniques @xcite or doppler mapping @xcite .",
    "this will also require good understanding of non - standard effects which are usually neglected , e.g.the effect of disc eccentricity @xcite .",
    "as far as bh candidates in the milky way are concerned , the relativistic iron line was detected in a well - known micro - quasar grs 1915 + 105 @xcite ; rapid rotation of the central black hole is not necessary in order to explain the data in this case .",
    "similar evidence for the broad and skewed iron line has been discovered with different degree of credibility in about eight other sources @xcite . in spite of a limited similarity of the relativistic iron line in these sources , we recall that recall that accretion discs have negligible gravity in bh candidates , and so we turn back to accretion discs galactic centres .",
    "moving to a region upstream the accretion flow  to the distance of hundreds @xmath4 and farther out from the core of a galaxy , the interaction between gaseous flows and other astronomical bodies ( stars forming a nuclear cluster ) can substantially change the structure , accretion rate and chemical composition of the flow , so we briefly touch this point , too .",
    "that way , the medium feeding the bh can be enriched above the level of usual solar metalicity @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "moving satellites feel the presence of the interstellar gas , especially in nuclei of active galaxies with high concentrations of stars and the relatively dense interstellar environment @xcite . accreting medium",
    "thus influences the motion and evolution of these bodies . even though self - gravitational effects of the medium become progressively less important near the centre , a relatively accurate knowledge of their impact is desired in order to derive , reliably , bh parameters from rotational motion of the surrounding luminous matter .",
    "the dissipative interaction of stellar - mass satellites and the resulting orbital decay proceed with a time - scale that is defined by properties of both components of the system : in the inner disc , hydrodynamical drag dominates the orbit evolution , while in the self - gravitating outer region , the disc structure becomes clumpy and direct collisional interaction is reduced . in even more remote parts ,",
    "gravitational relaxation is important for the cluster evolution , so the outer cluster is dynamically distinct from the core .",
    "syer , clarke & rees @xcite proposed that a stellar - mass body passing the galactic core can be captured on a quasi - stable bound orbit around a central super - massive bh . in the simplest version of the model , stars have been considered as bullets crashing on the disc surface and passing through at hyper - sonic speed .",
    "zurek , siemiginowska & colgate @xcite , armitage , zurek & davies @xcite and ivanov , igumenshchev & novikov @xcite examined various effects of passages ( of individual stars ) through diluted gaseous environment ( slab - disc geometry was assumed ; other people explored different contexts of this problem @xcite ) .",
    "pineault & landry @xcite discussed the statistical rate and distribution of impacts over the disc surface .",
    "self - gravity of the disc medium was also considered @xcite , as well as gr  effects in stellar motion @xcite , effects of the orbital decay of satellites by gravitational radiation and close encounters @xcite , or stellar coalescences @xcite .",
    "gradual changes of the physical and chemical state of satellites and of the disc itself were discussed @xcite .",
    "radiation torques @xcite as well as star",
    " gas hydrodynamic interaction @xcite induce different channels of angular momentum transport in the medium .",
    "the clumpy structure @xcite of the outer , self - gravitating disc reduces the efficiency of direct star  disc collisions , while turbulence in the medium tends to strengthen dissipation @xcite .",
    "repetitive transitions bring the satellites into the plane of the disc at almost circular orbits @xcite ( though , one can speculate of several effects that slow the process of circularisation down , so that eccentric or non - equatorial orbits may be maintained even at late stages @xcite ) .",
    "subsequent orbit evolution is reduced to a situation that was addressed in connection with the formation and migration of bodies inside proto - planetary discs @xcite .",
    "the inner cluster becomes flattened and its structural dimension is related to the size of the disc .",
    "one can immediately recognise plethora of consequences connected with non - sphericity , anisotropy and satellite segregation in the cluster : namely , the initial mass function is modified , as well as the form of spectral - line profiles and stellar velocity dispersions .",
    "the onset of star formation leads to gradual conversion of gas into stars in the disc @xcite .",
    "star - burst phenomenon has been indeed identified in some active galactic nuclei on @xmath352pc scales , which could represent outskirts of a dusty torus surrounding the central black hole @xcite . indeed",
    ", violent star formation could coincide with the outer parts of a massive nuclear cluster that is embedded within the dusty torus .",
    "even if @xmath353 , the effect of the disc gravity on the long - term evolution of stellar orbits should be taken into account together with dissipation via star ",
    "disc ( hydrodynamical ) interactions .",
    "this stands in contrast with the fact that gravitation of accretion discs has been neglected in most works exploring the nuclear cluster structure .",
    "the two influences are linked through their dependence on the disc density .",
    "a remark is worth making regarding the mass ratio @xmath257 ( which was criticised as unsuitable self - gravity criterion in section  [ sec : weak ] ) : it is a useful measure to assess the importance of stellar transitions across a self - gravitating disc in galactic nuclei , because attraction of the disc and the effects of transitions are both increasing , roughly proportionally , with @xmath7 .",
    "circularisation of the orbits , evolution of their inclination and the resulting capture rate are visibly affected by the disc gravity .",
    "an important point is the range of time - scales : ( i )  dynamical period ( of satellite stars revolution around the central mass ; the shortest time - scale ) , ( ii )  period of oscillations in orbital elements ( medium time - scale ; these oscillations are due to disc gravity ) and ( iii )  time for bringing the orbital plane into the disc ( caused by successive interactions with the disc ; long time - scale ) .",
    "the orbital decay continues also when satellites are embedded in the disc plane ; its rate varies depending on the ability of the body to clear a gap along its trajectory through the medium .",
    "different modes depend on the satellite masses , sizes and on the disc thickness and surface density at corresponding radius .",
    "the evolution of orbital parameters is an issue in extra - solar planetary research @xcite , which tackles similar systems on much small scales  cf .",
    "the discussion of planetary formation and migration @xcite .",
    "these topics have not yet been pursued to much detail in the context of galactic nuclear clusters embedded in the gaseous environment .",
    "one can understand the origin of orbital parameters oscillations in terms of kozai s theory @xcite , taking into account the gradual adiabatic diffusion of quasi - integrals of motion . in order to see the reason for orbital oscillations , one borrows from classical mechanics traditional approach to the disc gravitational potential @xmath354 as a perturbation acting on the satellite motion @xcite .",
    "again , the total potential is supposed to be dominated by the central field of the core , while the disc contribution @xmath355 can be transformed by a canonical transformation to the form which depends on mean orbital elements ( eccentricity @xmath356 , inclination @xmath357 , and argument of pericentre @xmath358 ; the bar denotes mean values ) and does _ not _ depend on the fast - changing variable ( mean anomaly ) .",
    "see @xcite for the explicit form of this new @xmath359 in terms of integration ( over the mean anomaly ) along an unperturbed keplerian ellipse ; in that paper , kuzmin s potential was employed as a simple model for the disc gravitational field ( it would be quite interesting to examine a generalization in terms of miyamoto & nagai s potential @xcite , which can be still performed analytically ) . in the first order of perturbation theory",
    "one finds that @xmath360 ; the mean semi - major axis @xmath361 is also constant and differs from the actual osculating semi - major axis by short - period terms only .",
    "the mentioned averaging procedure allows us to disregard short - term effects and concentrate on the long - term evolution .",
    "furthermore , owing to the axial symmetry of @xmath233 exists an additional constant of motion @xcite : @xmath362 ( figure  [ fig : vk ] left ) . this way the problem of orbital evolution is reduced to the evolution of @xmath363 and @xmath364 which are further constrained by condition @xmath365 .",
    "contours of the perturbation potential @xmath366 provide a convenient representation of mean orbital elements in the @xmath367-plane .",
    "finally , _ with the inclusion of orbital dissipation in the gaseous medium , one finds that an adiabatic drift occurs and drives the orbit across the contours of constant @xmath359 ; subsequently , the drift provokes excursions of the orbital elements when a separatrix is traversed_. a representative example of a trajectory is shown in figure  [ fig : vk ] ( right ) .",
    "the interplay between kozai s mechanism and gradual changes of the perturbation potential can give occasional ( but large ) eccentricity jumps ; one of them is clearly visible in the figure .",
    "next step would be to consider a consistent scheme for the whole cluster of satellites . in their classical paper , bahcall & wolf",
    "@xcite anticipated a way to reveal a hypothetical central massive hole ( embedded in a collisional environment of a globular cluster ) through stellar velocity dispersion and broadened wings of line profiles integrated over the bh domain of influence . in order to calculate the form of central cusps , the authors employed time - dependent diffusion equation . of other assumptions ,",
    "the most important was the spherical symmetry and isotropy of the cluster itself .",
    "probability density of satellites can be expressed in terms of their semi - major axes : @xmath368 , where @xmath369 denotes the number of satellites in a shell with radius @xmath13 and width @xmath370 .",
    "corresponding spatial density @xmath371 is thus proportional to @xmath372 . modifying the model assumptions ( namely , that about the importance of collisions ) leads to different but similar density profiles ( power - law at large radii ) .",
    "for example , the well - known plummer @xcite sphere has a finite - density core with density falling off as @xmath373 , while jaffe @xcite and hernquist @xcite models both decline @xmath374 at large radii .",
    "the latter case has a sound theoretical basis in the mechanics of violent relaxation .",
    "see also @xcite and , for more recent discussion and references , see @xcite .",
    "further , the collisional steady - state solutions have been reconsidered as a model for a cusp in the center of a galaxy @xcite .",
    "conclusions of these papers can be compared with more advanced models that relax some of the assumptions and include new effects , e.g.  resonances , enhanced loss - cone depletion or rotation of the cluster @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , self - consistent treatment of non - spherical stellar systems with the effects of self - gravity _ and _ the presence of an accretion disc are still an open problem .",
    "the disc induced dissipative orbital decay is distinct in its tendency to flatten the stellar component and even form a ring of stars that could be resolved observationally .",
    "figure  [ fig : cluster ] illustrates a stationary density profile of the cluster in a model where its members revolve around a bh and their orbits slowly decay due to dissipative effects .",
    "one can distinguish different populations of satellites ( see the left panel ) : those which form almost spherical cluster far from the centre , outside the disc outer radius , and those which have been dragged into the disc plane near the centre ( the latter form a ring ) .",
    "hence it is a certain generalisation of the bahcall ",
    "wolf @xcite cluster .",
    "a complementary representation is provided in the right panel of figure [ fig : cluster ] which shows an azimuthal section across the cluster .",
    "again , the inner cluster is evidently flattened and its dimension is tightly related to the size of the disc . it should be recalled that , with this approach , a relatively small volume is explored near bh , where the central mass has direct dynamical influence on the embedded stars and gas ( in other words , rotational support of the stellar motion is not a negligible fraction compared to their random motions ) . the linear size of this region is a function of @xmath1 and @xmath375 , and is typically less than @xmath376pc .",
    "note that the @xmath377 relation resembles the empirical correlation which has been determined in a large sample of galactic bulges @xcite ( although the constant of proportionality can be different in the innermost region around the central bh , which is unresolved by current observations ) .",
    "hence , in the inner cluster of stars , the obtained velocity dispersion should be determined by the joint action of gravity and of other agents , including dissipation in the interstellar environment .",
    "it was proposed @xcite that the effect of interaction between stars and the accretion flow shapes the observed @xmath1@xmath375 relation in the innermost region of some active galaxies ( those with sufficiently dense accretion discs in the core ) .",
    "the model of star ",
    "disc interaction leads to an axially symmetric , but non - spherical central cluster , and so the exact value of the power - law index of the @xmath1@xmath375 relation depends also on the observer line of sight ( the expected central velocity dispersion comes out somewhat larger for systems seen edge - on than for pole - on view ) .",
    "the model therefore represents rather extreme case , however , it is obvious that the interaction between stars and the intergalactic environment should be taken into account also at larger distances from the core @xcite .",
    "miralda - escud & kollmeier @xcite applied a similar idea to a much wider region ( and hence , applicable to actual present - day observations ) .",
    "these authors propose star - disc collisions are a self - regulating process that helps to feed the central bh and control its growth .",
    "the influence of the collisions remains imprinted in the bulge mass  stellar velocity dispersion relation , which concerns the region in galactic nuclei greatly exceeding the domain of direct gravitational influence of the super - massive bh .",
    "naively , one could expect that dissipation of satellite s orbital energy and momentum should always lead to a very dense nuclear cluster .",
    "however , the outcome may be more complicated because of non - sphericity and satellite segregation ( caused by differing pace of orbital evolution , according to the mass function and the distribution of sizes of stellar bodies ) .",
    "for example , recently , zier & biermann have showed @xcite , on the basis of numerical simulations , that a flattened shape of the cluster may arise due purely to gravitational effect of a massive binary bh in the core .",
    "they found that a stellar ring is formed on a parsec scale in the orbital plane of the central binary , while the cluster is gradually depleted .",
    "another approach to ( self - gravitating , eccentric ) galactic stellar discs was applied to the double nucleus of m31 @xcite and even the case of milky way was discussed recently @xcite . indeed ,",
    "as indicated also in this paper , there is a broad variety of reasons why the compact nuclear cluster should acquire a non - spherical structure in the course of evolution @xcite .",
    "the effects exhibited by self - gravitating accretion flows are merely one ingredient of a complex problem .",
    "gravitational field of black - hole discs induces great diversity of effects and gives ample scope for new ideas , of which we could touch only very limited section .",
    "first of all , as noted in the first part of this paper , even some very basic questions remain still open within the framework of exact general relativistic solutions for the black hole  disc gravitational field .",
    "our interest in global gravitational effects connected with astrophysical discs has lead us to focus on systems around super - massive bhs that reside in nuclei of galaxies , in which case the onset of self - gravity appears inevitable .",
    "recent ideas of heavy tori being formed in certain moments of neutron - star binary coalescence make these topics fitting also to stellar mass objects , although their `` discs '' must be very different in many respects . because of expected instabilities , accreting bhs are pertinent also for forthcoming gravitational wave experiments .",
    "astrophysical black holes are supposed to be embedded in complex cosmic environment which consists of multiple sub - systems spanning enormous range in the parameter space of masses , lengths and time - scales .",
    "gaseous discs represent just one of the components in this formation . under such circumstances ,",
    "analytical means can offer insight into physical mechanisms which are connected with the disc , but specific analytical solutions lack generality and must be inevitably simplified . in recent decades",
    ", much effort has been devoted to clarify , which processes dominate the evolution and what are the applicable ranges of model parameters .",
    "it is quite possible that some regimes of the disc operation have been missed in previous works .    in this respect ,",
    "an attractive recent speculation suggests that intermediate mass black holes ( with @xmath378 ) might also exist , possibly in cores of some globular clusters .",
    "if this new family of black holes is revealed and if they also accrete gas from their close environs ( current observational evidence is rather scarce ) , it would provide a fascinating opportunity to study accreting black hole sources for which the dynamical time is of the order of @xmath379  second .",
    "in other words , the expected variability of such object could span over intervals that can be readily sampled over many periods with available technology .",
    "we concentrated our attention on a fairly conventional case of gas discs around super - massive black holes at small , sub - parsec length - scales where the motion of stellar - mass orbiters can serve as an accurate tool to probe the system .",
    "this idea requires various intervening influences ( such as the perturbation of the central gravitational field caused by the disc / torus own gravity , or the orbital dissipation in the gaseous interstellar environment ) to be understood with sufficient accuracy .",
    "interesting and fundamental questions , namely , whether and where exactly the onset of self - gravity occurs in real accretion discs , still remain open to further research .",

    "<S> fluid discs and tori around black holes are discussed within different approaches and with the emphasis on the role of disc gravity . first reviewed are the prospects of investigating the gravitational field of a black hole  </S>",
    "<S> disc system by analytical solutions of stationary , axially symmetric einstein s equations . </S>",
    "<S> then , more detailed considerations are focused to middle and outer parts of extended disc - like configurations where relativistic effects are small and the newtonian description is adequate .    within general relativity , only a static case has been analysed in detail . </S>",
    "<S> results are often very inspiring , however , simplifying assumptions must be imposed : ad hoc profiles of the disc density are commonly assumed and the effects of frame - dragging and completely lacking . </S>",
    "<S> astrophysical discs ( e.g.  accretion discs in active galactic nuclei ) typically extend far beyond the relativistic domain and are fairly diluted . however , self - gravity is still essential for their structure and evolution , as well as for their radiation emission and the impact on the environment around . </S>",
    "<S> for example , a nuclear star cluster in a galactic centre may bear various imprints of mutual star  </S>",
    "<S> disc interactions , which can be recognised in observational properties , such as the relation between the central mass and stellar velocity dispersion . </S>"
