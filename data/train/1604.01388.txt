    "the only technical difference with the dirac equation is that the @xmath173 matrix representation is purely complex for the majorana case .",
    "majorana fields @xmath174 are just real and imaginary parts of the dirac equation for a particle and an antiparticle , respectively . in his work , majorana wrote ( translated from italian by luciano maiani ) `` even though it is perhaps not yet possible to ask experiments to decide between the new theory and a simple extension of the dirac equations to neutral particles , one should keep in mind that the new theory introduces a smaller number of hypothetical entities , in this yet unexplored field . ''",
    "it is thus said that majorana fields are more economical , i.e. majorana fields are more concise in terms of parameters . indeed , only two degrees of freedom are needed ( either a left- or a right - handed weyl spinor ) to describe massive fermions . in the majorana case the right - handed weyl spinor can be expressed through a left - handed one , and vice versa .",
    "majorana @xmath174 fields do not carry any @xmath175 charge @xmath176 , as @xmath177 they are strictly neutral and no global @xmath175 symmetry and conserved number such as the lepton number @xmath178 can be assigned to them .",
    "this feature is directly related to the presence of a majorana mass term in the lagrangian .",
    "let us take for example a mass term @xmath179 that includes right - handed spinors .",
    "we have @xmath180 that is not invariant under any global @xmath175 transformation .",

    "are both equivalent to weyl fermions and the lepton conservation is restored .",
    "it is also known that in the standard model ( meaning only left - handed interactions and neutrino masses in the ev range ) , active dirac and majorana neutrinos are practically not distinguishable , as in almost all processes involving neutrinos , their masses are much smaller than the energies involved and the helicity plays a role of a conserved charge ( non - standard or wrong helicities are suppressed by the neutrinos mass over energy ratios ) .",
    "this is known as dirac - majorana practical confusion theorem @xcite .",
    "let us note that an interesting option to tell apart majorana from dirac neutrinos lighter than the @xmath182 gauge boson mass has been proposed recently in @xcite .",
    "the idea is to study the muon spectrum in the @xmath183 decays .    how to detect lepton number violation ?",
    "we need to look for some rare processes .",
