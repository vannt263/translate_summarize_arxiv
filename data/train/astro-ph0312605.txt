    "the idea that there may exist a hidden mirror sector of particles and interactions with exactly the same properties as that of our visible world was suggested long time ago @xcite .",
    "the basic concept is to have a theory given by the product @xmath7 of two identical gauge factors with the identical particle contents , which could naturally emerge e.g. in the context of @xmath8 superstring .",
    "( from now on the  primed \" @xmath9 fields and quantities stand for the mirror ( m ) sector to distinguish from the ones belonging to the observable or ordinary ( o ) world . ) in particular , one can consider a minimal symmetry @xmath10 where @xmath11 stands for the standard model of observable particles : three families of quarks and leptons @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) and the higgs doublet @xmath14 , while @xmath15'$ ] is its mirror gauge counterpart with analogous particle content : fermions @xmath16 and the higgs @xmath17 .",
    "the m - particles are singlets of @xmath18 and vice versa , the o - particles are singlets of @xmath19 . more generally , one can have in mind the grand unified extensions like @xmath20 , @xmath21 , etc . besides the gravity",
    ", two sectors could communicate by other means @xcite .",
    "in particular , ordinary and mirror neutral particles could mix : e.g. photons @xcite or neutrinos @xcite , two sectors could have a common gauge group of flavour @xcite or common peccei - quinn symmetry @xcite .    a discrete symmetry",
    "@xmath22 interchanging corresponding fields of @xmath23 and @xmath24 , so called mirror parity , guarantees that two particle sectors are described by identical lagrangians , with all coupling constants ( gauge , yukawa , higgs ) having the same pattern . as a consequence",
    "the two sectors should have the same microphysics . in the particular case in which",
    "@xmath23 sector is left - handed and @xmath24 sector is right - handed , this discrete symmetry can be interpreted as the true parity @xcite .",
    "if the mirror sector exists , then the universe along with the ordinary photons , neutrinos , baryons , etc . should contain their mirror partners .",
    "one would naively think that the o- and m - sectors , having the same microphysics , should have also the same cosmology . and",
    "@xmath25 could be different , which would lead to somewhat different particle physics in the mirror sector @xcite .",
    "] then one would expect that m - particles are present in the same amount in the universe as o - ones , which would be in immediate conflict with the big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) bounds on the effective number of extra light neutrinos @xmath26 : the mirror photons , electrons and neutrinos would give a contribution equivalent to @xmath27 .",
    "however two sectors may have different initial conditions .",
    "in particular , after inflation , the two sectors could be reheated at different temperatures , @xmath28 , which can be achieved in certain inflationary models @xcite-@xcite . if the o- and m - particles interact weakly enough ( which condition is automatically fulfilled if the two worlds communicate only via the gravity ) , the two systems do not come into thermal equilibrium at later epoch and they evolve independently , maintaining approximately constant the ratio @xmath29 among their temperatures .",
    "the bbn constraints are satisfied if @xmath30 is sufficiently low .",
    "namely , the most conservative bound @xmath31 @xcite implies that @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "the difference of the temperatures @xmath33 breaks the symmetry between the cosmological properties of o- and m - sectors .",
    "namely , the number density of m - photons is much smaller than that of o - ones , @xmath34 .",
    "it is important to understand , whether the mirror baryon density @xmath35 could be comparable or even larger than the ordinary one @xmath36 , in which case they could constitute dark matter of the universe , or at least its significant fraction .",
    "the cosmological evolution of the mirror universe was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite and all the key epochs ( baryogenesis , nucleosynthesis , recombination etc . ) were analyzed in details .",
    "it was shown , in particular , that in the context of the gut or electroweak baryogenesis scenarios the condition @xmath37 yields that @xmath38 , where @xmath39 and @xmath40 respectively are the baryon asymmetries in o- and m - sectors @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath41 is not yet enough for having @xmath42 . since @xmath43 , the latter requires much stronger condition @xmath44 . as it was demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , this condition can be satisfied for a certain range of parameters , with the values of @xmath30 which are not too low , @xmath45 or so .",
    "however , more appealing situation emerges in a leptogenesis scenario due to particle exchange between the ordinary and mirror sectors suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , which predicts @xmath46 but also implies that @xmath47 or so , and thus can explain naturally the near coincidence between the visible ( o - baryon ) matter density @xmath48 and the dark ( m - baryon ) matter density @xmath49 in a rather natural way @xcite .",
    "if @xmath50 , mirror baryons emerge as a possible dark matter candidate ; they can contribute the dark matter of the universe along with the cold dark matter or even constitute a dominant dark matter component .",
    "an immediate question arises : how the mirror baryon dark matter ( mbdm ) behaves and what are the differences from the more familiar dark matter candidate as the cold dark matter ( cdm ) ?    the peculiar properties of mirror dark matter were discussed qualitatively in @xcite , and this analysis was confirmed and extended in refs .",
    "@xcite . in this paper",
    "we complete this program giving a complete quantitative presentation of the implications of the mbdm for the cosmological large scale structure ( lss ) and the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we analyze the relevant length scales for structure formation in the mirror photon - baryonic sector . in section 3",
    "we describe the effect of the evolution of perturbations in linear regime and compute the power spectra for the lss and cmb for various values of the two parameters @xmath30 and @xmath51 .",
    "the main differences with respect to a standard cdm scenario are discussed .",
    "finally , our main conclusions are summarized in section 4 .",
    "mirror matter may seem a tremendously complicated dark matter candidate .",
    "however , from the point of view of structure formation , it can be described relatively simply .",
    "the microphysics of the mirror sector is in fact well defined , being identical to that of our sector .",
    "all the differences with respect to the ordinary world can be described in terms of two macroscopic parameters which are the only free parameters in the model : [ x - beta ] x   ;   where @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) is the ordinary ( mirror ) photon temperature in the present universe,^{1/3}$ ] , where the factors @xmath54 and @xmath55 accounting for the degrees of freedom of the two sectors can be different from each other , see ref .",
    "@xcite for details . ] and @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) is the ordinary ( mirror ) baryon density fraction . in this section ,",
    "we discuss the dependence of the length scales relevant for structure formation from these parameters .    in the most general context",
    ", the present energy density contains relativistic ( radiation ) component @xmath58 , non - relativistic ( matter ) component @xmath59 and the vacuum energy density @xmath60 ( cosmological term ) .",
    "the present observational data indicate that the universe is almost flat , i.e. @xmath61 in a perfect accordance with the inflationary paradigm , with @xmath62 and the rest of the energy density is due to the cosmological term . in the context of our model , the relativistic fraction",
    "is represented by the ordinary and mirror photons and neutrinos , @xmath63 , where contribution of the m - species is negligible due the bbn constraint @xmath64 . as for the non - relativistic component",
    ", it contains the o - baryon fraction @xmath48 and the m - baryon fraction @xmath65 , while the other types of dark matter , e.g. the cdm , could also present and so in general @xmath66 .. in addition , an hdm component @xmath67 could be due to neutrinos with mass @xmath68 ev .",
    "the contribution of the mirror neutrinos scales as @xmath69 and thus it is irrelevant . ] in the following we use the central values by wmap @xmath70 and @xmath71 @xcite , and consider scenarios with @xmath72 where the limiting case @xmath73 corresponds to the case when the dark matter is entirely due to mbdm ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "the important moments for the structure formation are related to the matter - radiation equality ( mre ) and to the plasma recombination and matter - radiation decoupling ( mrd ) epochs .",
    "the mre occurs at the redshift : [ z - eq ] 1+z_eq= ( ) where we denote @xmath75 .",
    "therefore , for @xmath76 it is not altered by the additional relativistic component of the m - sector .",
    "the matter radiation decoupling takes place only after the most of electrons and protons recombine into neutral hydrogen and the free electron number density strongly diminishes , so that the photon scattering rate drops below the hubble expansion rate . in the ordinary universe",
    "the mrd takes place in the matter domination period , at the temperature @xmath77 ev which corresponds to redshift @xmath78 .",
    "the mrd temperature in the m - sector @xmath79 can be calculated following the same lines as in the ordinary one @xcite . due to the fact that in either case the photon decoupling occurs",
    "when the exponential factor in the saha equation becomes very small , we have @xmath80 , up to small logarithmic corrections related to @xmath81 , different from @xmath82 .",
    "hence [ z_dec ] 1+z_dec x^-1 ( 1+z_dec ) so that the mrd in the m - sector occurs earlier than in the ordinary one .",
    "moreover , for a value @xmath83 , where : [ x_eq ] x_eq= 0.34 ( ) the mirror photon decoupling epoch coincides with the mre epoch .",
    "this critical value plays an important role in our further considerations .",
    "namely , for @xmath84 the mirror photons would decouple yet during the radiation dominated period .",
    "let us discuss now the relevant scales for evolution of perturbations in the mbdm .",
    "the relevant scale for gravitational instabilities is jeans length , defined as the minimum scale at which , in the matter dominated epoch , sub - horizon sized perturbations start to grow .",
    "the mirror jeans scale is given by : [ jeans ] _j(z ) v_s(z ) ( /g(z))^1/2(1+z ) where @xmath85 is the matter density at a given redshift @xmath86 , @xmath87 is the sound speed in the m - plasma and the @xmath88 factor translates the physical scale at the time of redshift @xmath88 to the present scale .",
    "we remark that the m - plasma contains more baryons and less photons than the ordinary one , @xmath89 and @xmath90 , and thus the sound speed can have a quite different behaviour .",
    "we have : [ mirsound ] v_s(z ) ( 1 + 3_b ) ^-1/2 ^-1/2 where @xmath91 , quite in contrast with the ordinary world , where @xmath92 practically till the photon decoupling .",
    "the m - baryon jeans length reaches the maximal value at @xmath93 , where it is given by : so that the constant term in eq",
    ".  ( [ mirsound ] ) can be neglected . ]",
    "_ j , dec   mpc after decoupling , eq . ( [ mirsound ] ) does not hold anymore and the jeans scale decreases to very low values , due to the fact that the pressure supplied by the relativistic component of the mirror plasma disappears .",
    "density perturbations in mbdm on scales @xmath94 which enter the horizon at @xmath95 undergo uninterrupted linear growth immediately after @xmath96 .",
    "perturbations on scales @xmath97 start instead to oscillate immediately after they enter the horizon , thus delaying their growth till the epoch of m - photon decoupling .",
    "finally , we turn our attention to dissipative processes which can modify the purely gravitational evolution of perturbations .",
    "as occurs for perturbations in the o - baryonic sector , also the m - baryon density fluctuations should undergo the strong collisional damping around the time of m - recombination .",
    "the photon diffusion from the overdense to underdense regions induces a dragging of charged particles and washes out the perturbations at scales smaller than the mirror silk scale , @xmath98 .",
    "the behavior of @xmath98 as a function of the parameter @xmath30 and @xmath51 is given by [ lambda_s ] _s   mpc where @xmath99 for @xmath100 , and @xmath101 for @xmath84 .",
    "the impact of such scales on the evolution of density perturbations will be discussed in the next section .",
    "we clearly understand from the previous discussion that mbdm has peculiar features which can leave a characteristic imprint in the large scale structure of the universe .",
    "_ first _ , perturbations in mbdm on scales @xmath97 experience an oscillatory regime .",
    "the mbdm oscillations transmitted via gravity to the ordinary baryons , could cause observable anomalies in lss power spectrum and in the cmb angular power spectrum .",
    "_ second _ , for @xmath102 , the growth of perturbations on scales @xmath97 does not start at @xmath96 but is delayed till m - photon decoupling . if mbdm is the dominant dark matter component , one expect to observe less structures on these scales than in standard cdm scenario .",
    "_ finally _ , the density perturbation scales which can run the linear growth after the mre epoch are limited by the length @xmath98 . to some extent ,",
    "the cutoff effect is analogous to the free streaming damping in the case of warm dark matter ( wdm ) .    in order to make quantitative predictions we computed numerically the evolution of adiabatic perturbations in a universe in which is present a significant fraction of mirror dark matter .",
    "more precisely , following the approach described in @xcite , we solved numerically in a synchronous gauge the linear evolution equations for perturbations of all matter components : ordinary baryons , photons , neutrinos , their mirror analogues , and cold dark matter .",
    "in fact , with respect to the standard case , the full set of equations was doubled in order to properly take into account the evolution of the mirror photon - baryon system .",
    "the decoupling in ordinary and mirror plasma was followed numerically as prescribed in @xcite .",
    "all computations were made assuming a flat space - time geometry ( @xmath103 ; i.e. @xmath104 ) . in order to compare our predictions with the `` standard '' cdm results , we have chosen a `` reference cosmological model '' with scalar adiabatic perturbations and no massive neutrinos with the following set of parameters @xcite : [ ref - model ] _",
    "b = 0.023 ,   _",
    "m= 0.133   ( _ m = 0.25 ) ,   _ = 0.75 ,   n_s = 0.97 ,   h = 0.73 .",
    "we have included in this model the mirror sector and studied the effects of mbdm as a function of the parameters @xmath30 and @xmath51 . for the sake of comparison , in all calculations the total amount of matter @xmath105 was maintained constant , @xmath106 .",
    "mirror baryons contribution is thus always increased at the expenses of diminishing the cdm contribution .",
    "hence , the case when dark matter is entirely represented by the mbdm , with no cdm component , corresponds to @xmath107 .    to understand the impact of mirror matter on structure formation it is useful to look at fig . 1 and fig .",
    "2 where , for a selected wavenumber @xmath108 and for selected values of @xmath30 and @xmath51 , we show the evolution of the density contrast in the various components , @xmath109 , as a function of the scale factor @xmath110 . in fig .",
    "1 we show the situation when dark matter is entirely due to mirror baryons , while in fig . 2 mirror baryons represent a subdominant component .",
    "the panels ( a ) of the two figures are obtained by assuming large values of the mirror to ordinary temperature ratio ( i.e. @xmath111 ) , while the panels ( b ) correspond to the value @xmath112 which , for the chosen cosmological parameters , implies that m - photon decoupling approximately coincides with mre epoch ( c.f .",
    "( [ x_eq ] ) ) .    as long as the perturbation scale is larger than the horizon",
    ", the various components grow at the same rate ( @xmath113 ) .",
    "the situation drastically changes when the perturbations enter the horizon ( around @xmath114 ) . at this point ,",
    "baryons and photons , for each sector separately , become causally connected and behave as a single fluid . in other words , we have two fluids , the ordinary baryon - photon and the mirror baryon - photon ones .",
    "the sub - horizon evolution of these fluids depends on the value of the jeans lengths .",
    "if the jeans length is larger than the perturbation scale then the photo - baryon fluid starts to oscillate .",
    "this is always the case ( before the decoupling ) for ordinary baryons and photons .",
    "this is not always true in the mirror sector . by comparing panels ( a ) and ( b ) of these two figures we see in fact that for large values of @xmath30 the m - photons and baryons",
    "oscillate , while for smaller @xmath30 values perturbations undergo uninterrupted growth even before m - photon decoupling ( which occurs around @xmath115 ) .",
    "oscillations in the mirror sector ( when present ) , transmitted via gravity to the ordinary baryons , would produce observable anomalies in lss power spectrum and in the cmb anisotropy spectrum . by comparing the late time perturbation evolution in fig . 1a and fig . 2a",
    ", we can understand that the efficiency of this process depends on the amount of mirror matter present in the universe .",
    "after decoupling , in fact , baryons , which are no longer supported by photon pressure , rapidly fall in the potential wells created by the dominant dark matter component .",
    "if m - baryons dominate the dark matter budget , this leads asymptotically to @xmath116 ( see late time evolution in fig .",
    "this means that the baryonic structure power spectrum re - write the m - baryonic power spectrum , which is suppressed at small wavelength due to silk damping and is eventually modulated ( if @xmath30 is not too small ) as a results of acoustic oscillation .",
    "if instead cdm is the dominant dark matter component , we have asymptotically @xmath117 ( see late time evolution in fig.2a ) , which means that both m - baryonic and o - baryonic structures will follow the `` standard '' cdm power spectrum .",
    "the dependence of the lss power spectrum on the parameters @xmath30 and @xmath51 is shown explicitly in fig .",
    "3 . in the upper panel",
    "we assume that the dark matter is entirely due to mirror baryons and we consider variations of the @xmath30 parameter .",
    "for large @xmath30 values , as a result of the oscillations in mbdm perturbation evolution , one observes oscillations in the lss power spectrum .",
    "the position of these oscillations depends on @xmath30 , as can be easily understood .",
    "the smaller is @xmath30 the smaller is the mirror jeans scale at decoupling and thus the smaller are the perturbations scales which undergo acoustic oscillations . superimposed to oscillations",
    "one clearly see the cut - off in the power spectrum due to the silk damping .",
    "we remark that the silk scale @xmath118 also depends on @xmath30 ( and @xmath51 ) , as it is described by eq .",
    "( [ lambda_s ] ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the cut off in the power spectrum moves to smaller wavelength when we decrease the @xmath30 parameter .    in the lower panel of fig .",
    "3 we can appreciate the role of the parameter @xmath51 .",
    "one clearly sees that , as expected , the smallest is the amount of mirror baryons the less evident are the features in the lss power spectrum .",
    "interestingly , for large @xmath30 values , one observes a relevant effect even for relatively small amount of mirror baryons ; even for @xmath119 the effects are quite noticeable .",
    "[ lss_2 ]    = 10 cm    finally , in fig .",
    "4 we show the effects of mbdm on the angular spectrum of the cmb anisotropy .",
    "the predicted spectrum is quite strongly dependent on the value of @xmath30 ( see upper panel ) , and it becomes practically indistinguishable from the cdm case for @xmath120 , in this case the mbdm behaves just as the cdm at the scales relevant for the cmb oscillations .",
    "however , the effects on the cmb spectrum rather weakly depend on the fraction of mirror baryons ( see lower panel for different values of @xmath51 ) . in other words",
    ", the cmb anisotropy spectrum is mainly sensitive to amount of extra - radiation in the universe due to the the mirror sector ( which is fixed by @xmath30 , being @xmath121 ) but it can hardly distinguish between mbdm and cdm .",
    "our predictions can be compared with the observational data in order to obtain bounds on the possible existence of the mirror sector . to give a visual impression of the present situation we show in the fig .",
    "3 the 2df binned data @xcite and in fig .",
    "4 the wmap @xcite and acbar @xcite data .    to extract information from the experimental data one clearly needs a detailed statistical analysis .",
    "however , some general conclusions can be obtained in a rather straightforward way :    \\(i ) the assumption that dm is entirely due to mirror baryons is evidently not compatible with present lss data unless the value of @xmath30 is enough small : @xmath122 .",
    "\\(ii ) very high values of @xmath30 , @xmath123 , can be excluded even for a relatively small amount of mirror baryons .",
    "e.g. for @xmath124 , one has relevant effects on lss and cmb power spectrum down to values of m - baryon density of the order @xmath125 .",
    "on the other hand , intermediate values @xmath126 can be still allowed if the mbdm is a subdominant component of dark matter .",
    "\\(iii ) for small values of @xmath30 , say @xmath127 , neither the linear lss power spectrum nor the cmb angular power spectrum can distinguish the mbdm from the cdm . in this case , in fact , the jeans length @xmath128 and the silk length @xmath129 , which mark region of the spectrum below which one sees the effects of mirror baryons , decrease to very low values , which undergo non linear growth from relatively large red - shift .",
    "the idea of a mirror sector of particles and interactions has attracted a significant interest over last years .",
    "the concept of mirror world could have interesting implications for the following problems : detection of machos via gravitational microlensing @xcite , search ordinary - mirror star binaries @xcite and mirror planetary objects @xcite , implications of mirror matter for galaxy halos @xcite , the role of the sterile neutrinos in neutrino physics @xcite and their implications for ultra - high energy cosmic rays @xcite and gamma ray bursts @xcite , implications for the flavor and cp violation and axion physics @xcite , etc .",
    "in particular , the effects based on the kinetic mixing among the ordinary and mirror photons @xcite can provide interesting possibilities for revealing the mirror matter in positronium decays @xcite and in dark matter detectors @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we have studied the cosmological implications of the mirror matter as dark matter .",
    "more precisely , we have quantitatively discussed the effect of the mbdm on the evolution of density perturbations in the linear regime as function of the two free parameters in the model : the temperature of the mirror plasma ( limited by bbn to @xmath130 ) and the amount of mirror baryonic matter @xmath131 .",
    "we summarize here the main conclusions .",
    "the concept of mirror baryons , as possible candidate for dark matter , introduces two new scales in the structure formation scenario : the jeans scale of the mirror photo - baryon fluid , @xmath132 , and the silk damping scale of mirror baryons , @xmath133 . due to the pressure support of mirror photons",
    ", perturbations in the mirror fluid on scales smaller than @xmath128 can not grow before mirror photon decoupling . if decoupling occurs after the mre epoch ( i.e. if @xmath134 ) , and if mirror baryons are a relevant dark matter component , one expect then to see less structures on these scales with respect to the standard cdm scenario .",
    "in addition , mirror baryon perturbations on scales @xmath97 go through an oscillatory regime .",
    "this could produce , via gravity , observable distortions in the cmb and lss power spectrum .",
    "finally , the mirror silk scale @xmath133 introduces a cut - off for the perturbation scales which can run the linear growth after matter - radiation equality .",
    "all these effects were taken into account numerically in the fortran code which we used to follow the perturbation evolution in presence of the mirror sector and to compute the lss and cmb power spectra .",
    "the results are shown in figs . 3 and 4 for various choices of parameters @xmath30 and @xmath51 .",
    "from a comparison with present observational data , one is able to conclude that the existence of a mirror sector with a relatively high temperature , @xmath135 and a high mirror baryon density @xmath136 few @xmath56 can be already excluded .",
    "this confirms previous estimates of refs .",
    "@xcite and improves the bbn bound on the mirror sector parameter space . more details can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in order to further reduce the allowed parameter space",
    ", it would be clearly important to extend the analysis to the non - linear regime .",
    "many relevant questions , related to the dynamics in this regime , can be formulated : what implications could have the mirror silk cutoff for scales which already went non - linear , e.g. for scanning the early universe via studying reionization , quasars , lyman-@xmath137 forest , etc . ?",
    "can mirror baryons , being a dissipative dark matter component , provide extended triaxial halos instead of being clumped into the galaxy as usual baryons ?",
    "how the star formation mechanism proceeds in the m - sector where the temperature / density conditions and chemical contents are much different from the ordinary ones ? could the mirror protogalaxy at a certain moment before disk formation become a collisionless system of the mirror stars and thus maintain a typical elliptical structure ?",
    "what is the initial mass function of mirror stars , and how many and how heavy mirror stars do we expect as machos in the galactic halo ?    many other questions can be formulated and various new data are needed to discriminate different cosmological settings . our numerical analysis , which describes the mirror world in the linear regime , sets the starting point for answering these questions .",
