    "the scaling exponent @xmath5 is referred to as the hurst exponent @xcite and qualifies the underlying correlation structure : @xmath6 corresponds to an uncorrelated , random process whereas @xmath7 indicates persistent , long - range correlations .",

    "previous work has focused only on spatially local measures of brain activity or considered pairs of nodes in networks @xcite rather than analyzing global brain activity . in complex systems , the global activity can be very informative about the generating dynamical structure @xcite , in particular when studying critical behavior @xcite . here",
    ", we adopted these concepts to investigate criticality in the brain . by using source - reconstructed magneto - encephalographic ( meg ) signals we sought to disambiguate between the scaling characteristics of amplitude and phase fluctuations because they may resemble different aspects of cortical functioning .",

    "we employed a modified form of dfa including ( bayesian ) model selection to verify the presence of power - law behavior .    in a nutshell , to quantify the autocorrelation structure of ( the cumulative sum of ) a signal @xmath27 , one divides it into non - overlapping segments @xmath28 , with @xmath29 being discrete time steps and @xmath30 indexing the segments ; @xmath31 is the number of non - overlapping segments of length @xmath32 . in each segment",

    "we report power - law scaling in both amplitude and phase of collective neural activity on long time scales , which is consistent with the hypothesis that the brain operates in a critical state .",
    "operating in a critical state is not the only way a system can generate power - law scaling .",
    "systems in subcritical states @xcite or merely stochastic systems may also display power laws .",
    "biological systems display sub- and supercritical dynamics but they can be tuned into criticality .",
    "we favor the interpretation of critical states , also because it is consistent with scale - free auto - correlation structures of single channel eeg activity @xcite , size and duration of neural avalanches and , in the spatial domain , degree distributions of neuroanatomical and functional connectivity networks .",
    "such scaling laws in neuronal dynamics are also correlated with those found in behavior @xcite .",
    "previous studies addressing power - law scaling in neuronal dynamics were solely based on spatially local measures .",
    "for instance , power - law scaling has been reported using pair - wise synchronization measures like pli and @xmath84 by , e.g. , kitzbichler and coworkers @xcite and farmer @xcite .",
    "in contrast , we evaluated scaling behavior on a global brain scale by using overall amplitude and phase synchrony as collective variables . analyzing",
    "the scaling behavior of these variables enabled us to directly compare phase and amplitude behavior in brain activity .    what does the difference in power - law scaling of amplitudes and phases tell us about information processing in the brain ?",
    "despite the fact that amplitude and phase differ in their perseverance , both show long - range correlations over a scale of hundreds of seconds , suggesting that they reflect ` memory ' of cortical states .",
    "a higher scaling exponent reflects a slower decay of auto - correlations and hence a more predictable signal with decreased entropy .",
    "therefore , we speculate that the difference in scaling exponents and their associated complexity reflect that amplitude and phase play different roles in information processing and memory decoding : ( low - fidelity ) amplitude dynamics decode long - term memory , whereas the ( high - fidelity ) phase synchrony comprises a more complex and flexible memory coding ( in an information theoretic sense ) .",
    "volume conduction can be a confounder in analyzing encephalographic recordings .",
    "several methods to mitigate its effects have been proposed , generally relying on removing the instantaneous interactions that signify volume conduction @xcite . in consequence",
    "these methods can only be applied in a pair - wise fashion , such that they are not applicable when considering the variables @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "we note , however , that volume conduction does not significantly influence the auto - correlation structure of the signals under study .",
    "this finds support by shriki and coworkers @xcite who showed that mere linear mixing can not ` transform ' uncorrelated activity to power - law scaling .",
    "in fact , if activity displays a power law , linear mixing does not alter this apart from slightly lowering the scaling exponent .",
    "the occurrence of power laws is not only consistent with the criticality hypothesis @xcite .",
    "the macroscopic behavior of self - organizing processes can | in general | be cast into a low - dimensional system when critical @xcite ; this in fact motivated looking at collective amplitude and phase synchrony .",
    "several modeling studies support the seminal role of self - organization in neural dynamics and often highlight self - organized criticality .",
    "for example , synaptic plasticity under the influence of a simple learning rule leads to scale - free networks and power - law distributions of avalanche dynamics @xcite . in resting state ,",
    "the mechanism of local feedback mediated inhibition increases model performance @xcite and may also be interpreted as a form of self organization .",
    "furthermore , the slow evolution of the order parameters in self - organizing systems is consistent with the time scale on which rsns evolve .",
    "while previous work has shown that rsns fluctuate at slow ( @xmath87sec ) time scales @xcite , it has been recently shown that rsns are also expressed in meg activity on faster ( @xmath88sec ) time scales @xcite . alongside the results in this paper",
    ", this represents mounting evidence that rsns are expressed across a range of time scales , i.e. they are time scale invariant .    in summary",
    "we have shown the presence of persistent long - range correlations in the evolution of global brain dynamics , i.e. the auto - correlation function obeys a power - law with scaling exponents exceeding those corresponding to random processes without memory .",
    "this adds further support to the hypothesis that the brain is in a ( permanently ) critical state .",
    "the here - reported scaling exponents clearly discriminate amplitude and phase dynamics , suggesting their differential role in whole - brain information processing ."
