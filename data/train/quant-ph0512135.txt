    "effective hamiltonians can arise in a variety of contexts . chosen to focus on some particular aspect or sub - system ,",
    "an effective hamiltonian @xmath0 is constructed from the full hamiltonian @xmath1 of a physical system .",
    "often , @xmath0 is simpler and of dimension smaller than @xmath1 .",
    "the use of complex energies , with the imaginary part a stand - in for the usually complicated and infinite - dimensional aspects of friction or dissipation , is a familiar example , occurring in various areas of physics@xmath2 .",
    "both the time - dependent and the time - independent schrdinger equation admit descriptions in terms of effective hamiltonians , forming the theme of this article .",
    "consider first a time - independent situation , namely , stationary states of a time - independent hamiltonian @xmath1",
    ". these may include discrete bound states with negative energy eigenvalues and scattering states at positive energy but also resonances in that positive energy sector , which are  quasi - bound \" states@xmath3 .",
    "resonances are typically viewed in terms of a decomposition @xmath4 , and the basis states provided by the eigenfunctions of @xmath5 .",
    "these will include both bound and continuum states .",
    "the  interaction \" @xmath6 , which is contained within the full @xmath1 , mixes these states of @xmath5 , such a superposition constituting the quasi - bound resonance state of the full @xmath1 . because of this superposition",
    ", the resonance state has both discrete and continuum character .",
    "further , the inclusion of the continuum means that the superposition necessarily embraces an infinity of states .",
    "the splitting @xmath4 may be either in real configuration space or in state space .",
    "the former can arise , for instance , when the potential in a two - particle system goes asymptotically to zero so that for any positive energy the particles separate to infinity , but intervening barriers may temporarily trap the system before quantum tunneling allows escape .",
    "this last phrase with its  before \" and  temporarily \" introduces a time aspect into a time - independent problem . while unnecessary , this exemplifies the role of complementary pictures in quantum physics .",
    "the problem as a whole is of time - independent stationary states , some of which are characterized not just by an energy position but also a width ( tunneling or otherwise ) and , possibly , other real parameters as well ( the so - called  profile index \" @xmath7 of an asymmetric resonance being an example@xmath8 ) .",
    "the energy and width may be subsumed into a complex energy @xmath9 , although there is nothing intrinsically complex about the problem of stationary states of a real @xmath1 . the width @xmath10 in a time - independent picture is complementarily related to the lifetime of the resonance in terms of a time evolution .",
    "examples of potentials with intervening barriers are many : alpha - decay of nuclei , electric field ionization , two - valley potentials with angular momentum barriers in atoms and molecules@xmath11 , etc .",
    "1 . in any of these systems , if the radial variable @xmath12 ( or a hyperspherical equivalent in a many - particle system@xmath11 ) is split into an inner and an outer region so that the former includes the barriers , even the states of positive @xmath13 are bound states within that region . but they leak out into the outer region in the full problem and are , indeed resonances . because of the key role played by shapes of potentials that give rise to them , they are called  shape \" resonances .    instead of the splitting in the above paragraph into two parts in @xmath12",
    ", the @xmath4 breakdown may be in terms of states .",
    "thus , consider doubly - excited states in atoms and molecules , the first of these in the helium atom serving as a good example@xmath11 .",
    "as in fig .",
    "2 , consider states of this two - electron system at energies around 58 ev above the ground state of the atom . in @xmath14 symmetry , these being good quantum numbers of the whole system ( we will consider the non - relativistic @xmath1 , ignoring spin - orbit or other relativistic complications ) , there lie here the states of the one - electron ionization continuum built on the he@xmath15 ionic ground state . in an independent electron description , that is ,",
    "when @xmath5 includes only one - electron terms and possibly a mean field of the electron - electron interaction , with the residual part of this interaction constituting @xmath6 , such states can be designated @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the wave - number of the continuum electron related to its kinetic energy through @xmath18 .",
    "the values of @xmath19 are , approximately , ( 58 - 24.6 = 33.4 ev ) .",
    "but there also lie in this region bound states of @xmath5 that may be described as @xmath20 and @xmath21 , which are states of an electron bound to he@xmath22 or @xmath23 that share the same overall symmetry .",
    "thus , in terms of such an independent electron description , all these states are degenerate and , by virtue of the residual @xmath6 , are superposed in the physical eigenstates of the full @xmath1 .",
    "these are the doubly - excited ",
    "feshbach \" resonances@xmath24 , having both discrete and continuum character in their description , that may be seen either in excitation cross - sections from the ground state ( with 58 ev of excitation energy delivered by some means ) or in elastic scattering of electrons from he@xmath15 around 33.4 ev .    in summary of the above two paragraphs ,",
    "the two alternative pictures are but just that , our pictures or descriptions .",
    "the physical system is one of eigenstates of the three - body hamiltonian @xmath1 in a certain energy range and is an integral whole . however , in our handling of them , and even more in the pictures we develop for our understanding , we develop alternative breakdowns in terms of simpler sub - systems , either in the real configuration space of @xmath12 or in two - electron states of an independent particle picture . even as we do so , pictures and models being necessarily involved in our approach to any physical situation , we must also keep in mind that @xmath5 , @xmath6 , state configurations @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , etc .",
    ", are not elements of the underlying physical reality nor are they accessible to measurement . in the same vein ,",
    "the distinction between the terms  shape \" and  feshbach \" is also somewhat arbitrary but , nevertheless , useful . in particular , with reference to figs . 1 and 2 , whereas the former often lie just above the energy threshold to which they are attached , the latter lie just below ( the he@xmath28 threshold ) .",
    "correspondingly , the shape resonances tend to be broad ( shorter lived ) whereas the feshbach resonances are typically narrow ( longer lived ) . in a closely - related two - electron system to our discussion above , namely the negative ion of the hydrogen atom , and in the symmetry @xmath29 which can be reached by one - photon absorption from the ground state ( unlike @xmath14 which takes two photons ) , an example of each was clearly shown on either side of the h@xmath30 threshold by a classic experiment@xmath31 .",
    "the partitioning of a hamiltonian into two spaces is conveniently done in the ",
    "feshbach projection operator \" formalism@xmath32 . with @xmath33 and @xmath34 projection operators into what are usually referred to as  closed \" and  open \" subspaces ( for alternative terminologies , see section 8.6.1 and 8.6.2 of ref .",

( [ eqn1 ] ) by @xmath33 from the left , and substituting for @xmath39 from eq .",

    "no approximation made , the second term in @xmath0 includes the effect of the remaining @xmath34-space .",

    "the first @xmath42 term has a purely discrete spectrum but some of those eigenvalues may acquire both a shift and a width as a result of the second term , which involves coupling to the @xmath34-space .",
    "these are the resonances .",
    "because of the energy denominator , the effect of this second term can be dramatic at energy values @xmath19 close to an eigenvalue of @xmath43 .",
    "turn next to the time - dependent schrdinger equation , @xmath44 , with a dot standing for a time derivative , and where we choose to work with the evolution operator @xmath45 rather than the wave function @xmath46 , to which it is easily related through @xmath47 . upon writing    @xmath48    taking a derivative with respect to time , and multiplying from the left by @xmath49",
    ", we get    @xmath50    again , we have a reduced equation for @xmath51 alone but , of course , the effective hamiltonian incorporates the part contained in @xmath52 so that the reduced expression is formally complete with no approximation implied .",
    "a connection to variational principles and identities will be discussed at the end of this comment .",
    "the above is completely general for any time - dependent problem .",
    "one important specific application is in separating the geometric phase@xmath53 from other elements of time evolution . with the advent of fault - tolerant quantum computation ,",
    "the geometric phase is seen to have advantages in robustness and fidelity over dynamical phases that accumulate as a result of energy changes in time@xmath54 .",
    "consider , as an illustration , an angular momentum that couples through its magnetic moment to a magnetic field @xmath55 , with only linear coupling in @xmath56 .",

    "the first equation for @xmath69 decouples from the other two and may be solved by itself first , followed by simple quadrature of the other two .",
    "note that any value of spin-@xmath70 obeys the same set of equations in eq .",
    "( [ eqn8 ] ) , since no use was made of any specific representation of the operators @xmath71 , only their commutators .",
    "further , @xmath45 is guaranteed to be unitary by construction@xmath58 .",
    "indeed , this implies relationships between the three complex @xmath60 :    @xmath72    so that there are only three linearly independent quantities which may be chosen as the real and imaginary parts of @xmath73 and re @xmath74 . with this , for @xmath75 , eq .",

    "this construction reduces inductively the operator for @xmath92 to the one for @xmath94 with defining equations for complex parameters @xmath95 which are analogs of @xmath96 and phases that are analogs of @xmath74 .",
