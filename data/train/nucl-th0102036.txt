    "their role and relevance , however , can be different in different reactions and kinematics .",

    "the explicit expressions of these structure functions in terms of the components of the hadron tensor @xmath48 , where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the eigenvalues of the spin of the nucleon whose polarization is considered , can be easily obtained from eq .",

    "these differences , which are due only to the treatment of the two - nucleon overlap , clearly show that the shape and the size of the cross section are very sensitive to this treatment and that an accurate description of both aspects related to nuclear structure and correlations is needed to produce reliable numerical predictions .",

    "the main contribution is generally given by the seagull current , but also the other terms , in particular the interference between seagull and pion - in - flight , can be meaningful in some observables .",
    "in this section numerical results are presented for the @xmath1o(@xmath3)@xmath4c reaction .",
    "calculations have been performed within the theoretical framework of ref .",
    "the model is basically the same used for the @xmath1o(@xmath2)@xmath4n reaction where the nuclear current is adapted to a @xmath6 pair .",
    "thus , in the two - body current the charge - exchange terms vanish and only a part of the @xmath137 current contributes",
    ". however , a different treatment of the two - nucleon overlap function is used , based on the results of the calculation of the two - proton spectral function of @xmath1o @xcite .",
    "the two - nucleon overlaps for transitions to the lowest - lying discrete final states of the residual nucleus are obtained from a two - step procedure , where long - range and short - range correlations are treated in a separate but consistent way .",
    "the calculation of long - range correlations is performed in a shell - model space large enough to incorporate the corresponding collective features which influence the pair removal amplitudes .",
    "the single - particle propagators used for this dressed random phase approximation description of the two - particle propagator also include the effect of both long - range and short - range correlations . in the second step that part of the pair removal amplitudes which describes the relative motion of the pair",
    "is supplemented by defect functions , accounting for src and obtained from the same g - matrix which is also used as the effective interaction in the rpa calculation .",
    "the explicit expression of the overlap function is given in terms of a sum of products of relative and c.m .",
    "wave functions .",
    "different components contribute to different transitions . here",
    ", we present numerical results for the transition to the 0@xmath129 ground state of @xmath4c , where the components are : @xmath170 , which is combined with @xmath154 , and @xmath171 , which is combined with @xmath157 .",
    "the ground state has been already separated in recent high - resolution experiments for the @xmath1o(@xmath9)@xmath4c reaction @xcite .",
    "the experimental cross sections are well reproduced by the results of our model and clear evidence for src has been obtained in the comparison .",
    "thus , it seems interesting to investigate the same final state also for the ( @xmath3 ) reaction .    the differential cross section of the @xmath1o(@xmath3)@xmath4c reaction , calculated in the same coplanar kinematics considered in sect",
    ".  [ sec:3 ] , is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig10 ] .",
    "the shape of the distribution is determined by the combination of the two components with @xmath154 and @xmath157 .",
    "it is clearly shown in the right panel of the figure that @xmath170 with its @xmath162-wave c.m .",
    "component prevails for angles corresponding to low values of the recoil momentum , where the @xmath172-wave has the minimum , while the contribution of @xmath171 knockout becomes important al large values of @xmath173 , where the @xmath162-wave decreases .",
    "it was established in previous investigations that src and two - body current play a different role in different relative states @xcite .",
    "while src are quite strong for the @xmath170 state and much weaker for the @xmath174 states , the contribution of the two - body @xmath137 current is strongly reduced in @xmath170 @xmath6 knockout @xcite and generally dominant in @xmath174 knockout .",
    "therefore , @xmath170 @xmath6 knockout is generally dominated by the contribution of the one - body current , and thus by src , while @xmath174 @xmath6 knockout is generally dominated by the @xmath137 current . the selectivity of the reaction to different states was exploited in ( @xmath9 ) , where it was possible to envisage situations where either contribution is dominant and can thus be disentangled .",
    "the result , however , depends on kinematics and on the reaction that is considered .",
    "thus , it can not be directly applied to ( @xmath3 ) reactions , where only the transverse components of the nuclear current contribute and the longitudinal component , where the effects of src show up more strongly , is absent . on the other hand , in the considered kinematics , where @xmath164 mev , the contribution of the @xmath137 current should not be emphasized , as it is also demonstrated by the results of sect .",
    "[ sec:3 ] for the ( @xmath2 ) reaction .    in the present calculation the @xmath137 current",
    "gives indeed the major contribution to @xmath171 knockout , but a sizable effect is also given by its interference with the one - body current .",
    "the one - body current is dominant in @xmath170 knockout . in the region of the maximum , where @xmath171 has the minimum , the contribution of the @xmath137 current is larger in @xmath170 than in @xmath171 .",
    "this explains the result in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig10 ] .",
    "most of the contribution of the one - body current is given by @xmath170 knockout .",
    "this determines the @xmath162-wave shape of the angular distribution .",
    "the result for the @xmath137 current is due to the combined effect of @xmath171 , which gives the main contribution at large values of @xmath173 , and of @xmath170 , which enhances the cross section with the @xmath137 current at low values of @xmath173 . in the final cross section",
    "both processes due to src and to the two - body current are important : src are of particular relevance at larger values of @xmath167 and the @xmath137 at lower values of @xmath167 .",
    "the polarization observables are displayed in figs .",
    "[ fig : fig11 ] and [ fig : fig12 ] .",
    "all the calculated quantities are sizable .",
    "both contributions of the one - body and of the two - body current are important , even though the relevance of the two reaction mechanisms can be different for different observables .",
    "for instance , @xmath92 is basically given by the one - body current , while for other observables the final result , given by the sum of the one - body and the two - body current , is very different from the two separate contributions .",
    "thus , a combined measurement of cross sections and polarization observables would be able to disentangle the two reaction processes and to test the ingredients and the approximations of a theoretical model .",
    "the cross section and the polarization observables calculated for the @xmath1o(@xmath3)@xmath4c reaction in the out - of - plane kinematics with @xmath175 are given in figs .",
    "[ fig : fig13]-[fig : fig16 ] . in comparison with the result for the coplanar kinematics , the cross section in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig13 ] shows the same kinematic effect found in the @xmath1o(@xmath2)@xmath4n reaction .",
    "values of @xmath173 between 90 and 160 mev/@xmath150 are forbidden , and the region that in the coplanar kinematics of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig10 ] corresponds to the maximum of @xmath170 and to the minimum of @xmath171 is cut . as a consequence ,",
    "the contribution of @xmath171 is always larger than the one of @xmath170 all over the angular distribution .",
    "the size of the final cross section is reduced in the region of the maximum and a different shape is obtained .",
    "the contributions of the one - body and of the two - body current displayed in the left panel are of about the same size and add up in the final cross section .",
    "all the polarization observables in figs .",
    "[ fig : fig14]-[fig : fig16 ] are sizable .",
    "also in this case both the one - body and the two - body current are important . in some observables",
    "either contribution prevails or appears even dominant in the calculation , but both reaction processes are in general important in the final result and their theoretical treatment can be tested in combined measurements of the different observables .",
    "also the polarization observables which vanish in pw are sizable",
    ". their determination might be of particular interest for the study of fsi , and in particular of the correlations between the two outgoing particles in the final state , that are neglected in the present model .",
    "for the kinematics that are usually considered these effects should not be large in the cross section , but might be emphasized in particular polarization observables .",
    "two - nucleon knockout reactions represent the best suited tool for exploring the behaviour of nucleon pairs in nuclei and their mutual interaction . in particular , electromagnetic reactions give a direct access to nuclear structure and correlations .",
    "a combined analysis of cross sections and polarization observables is required for this study .    in this paper",
    "we have given the general properties of the ( @xmath0 ) reaction where the incident photon is linearly or circularly polarized and the polarization of one outgoing nucleon is detected . in the most general situation 16 measurable quantities , including the cross section , are obtained , each one corresponding to one different structure function .",
    "these observables allow a complete investigation of all the components and the properties of the hadron tensor",
    ".    for a complete determination an out - of - plane kinematics is needed , _",
    "i.e. _ a kinematics where one nucleon does not lie on the plane of the photon and of the other nucleon . in the more usual coplanar kinematics a situation similar to the one of the ( @xmath95 ) reaction is recovered , and only 8 observables are nonvanishing .",
    "ten structure functions , and therefore the corresponding observables , vanish when the pw approximation is considered for the outgoing nucleons .",
    "these quantities appear very well suited to investigate the effect of fsi between the ejected nucleons and the residual nucleus , and , possibly , the mutual interaction between the two outgoing nucleons .",
    "numerical examples have been presented for the exclusive @xmath1o(@xmath2)@xmath4n and @xmath1o(@xmath3)@xmath4c reactions .",
    "@xmath1o is a well suited target for this investigation . from the theoretical point of view ,",
    "a great deal of work has been done and a large experience has been acquired on this nucleus . from the experimental point of view ,",
    "precise measurements have been already carried out for these reactions or are planned in different laboratories , aiming at determining cross sections and polarization observables for individual final states .",
    "it is of particular interest to consider exclusive reactions .",
    "previous investigations have shown that different final states exhibit a different sensitivity to the theoretical ingredients of the calculations and to the various reaction processes .",
    "thus , the experimental resolution of specific final states may act as a filter to disentangle and separately investigate different reaction processes and , in particular , to study nuclear correlations .",
    "the results are very sensitive to the treatment of the nucleon pair wave function and to different aspects involving nuclear structure and correlations .",
    "the comparison of theoretical predictions with experimental data can thus impose severe constraints to the theoretical models .",
    "the polarization measurements , which are here particularly addressed , are expected to be sensitive to the small components of the transition amplitudes , which do not show up in the cross sections , where they are generally overwhelmed by the dominant components .    in this",
    "paper cross sections and polarization observables of the @xmath1o(@xmath2)@xmath4n and @xmath1o(@xmath3)@xmath4c reactions have been calculated with a similar approach and considering the transitions to the ground state of the residual nucleus .",
    "the nuclear current contains a one - body part , which contributes to the transition only through the correlations , and a two - body part , given by the pion seagull , the pion - in - flight and the @xmath137 isobar contributions for ( @xmath2 ) reactions , and only by the contribution of the @xmath137 without charge exchange for ( @xmath3 ) reactions . in the @xmath5 pair wave function the effects of short - range and tensor correlations",
    "are taken into account , while the @xmath6 pair includes a consistent treatment of short - range and long - range correlations .",
    "as an example , a photon energy of 120 mev , which seems suitable for experiments , has been chosen in the calculations . at this energy value",
    "the @xmath137 plays only a minor role .",
    "thus , in the @xmath1o(@xmath2)@xmath4n reaction the seagull current is dominant .",
    "the contribution of the one - body current is not very important in general , but can be meaningful in particular situations .",
    "the contribution of tensor correlations is significant , particularly at high values of the recoil momentum .",
    "both the one - body and the @xmath137 current are important in the @xmath1o(@xmath3)@xmath4c reaction .",
    "the relevance of either contribution can be emphasized in particular kinematic conditions and in different observables .",
    "the polarization observables are always sizable .",
    "they are sensitive to all the different terms of the nuclear current and also to their interference . a combined experimental determination of cross sections and polarizations would give a complete information on the reaction process and result in a stringent test of the theoretical models .",
    "this would make it possible to disentangle the different contributions to the reactions and shed light on the genuine nature of correlations in nuclei .",
