    "a more  microscopic \" approach is to model the stochastic evolution of a population of individual cells @xcite .",
    "the simplest such models are branching processes @xcite , with countless biological applications @xcite ranging from bacterial evolution @xcite to cell homeostasis @xcite . branching processes",
    "have also been used to model several aspects of tumor progression @xcite .",
    "can , however , simple branching processes provide a quantitative description of such complex biological phenomena as homeostasis  the maintenance of healthy tissues ?",
    "a promising positive answer appeared in @xcite , where inducible genetic labeling was used to analyze the stochastic fate of the progenies of a single initial marked cell in the basal layer of epidermis in mice .",
    "the probabilities of finding clones of any given sizes at various times were fit remarkably well by a simple constant rate two - type branching process of progenitor ( @xmath0 ) and post - mitotic cells ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the scheme of the process is as follows @xmath2    this model seemed unsolvable @xcite in the sense that there was no known explicit formula for the probability @xmath3 of finding @xmath4 number of @xmath0 cells and @xmath5 number of @xmath1 cells for any finite time .",
    "we showed in @xcite how to obtain an exact expression for the generating function of @xmath3 .",
    "once the generating function is known , the probability @xmath3 can be efficiently obtained numerically by fast fourier transformation .",
    "the simplicity of the above model lies in the trivial behavior of @xmath1 cells  which can only die but not proliferate  and in the criticality of the process , that is the symmetry of birth and death rates of @xmath0 cells .",
    "is it possible to solve more general two type birth - death processes explicitly where the second cell type can both die and proliferate ? in this paper we present an explicit solution of such a general continuous time birth - death process , proposed by kendall @xcite to model the onset of mutations during tumor progression . in this model",

    "there are several possible applications of model .",
    "it can model the onset of a new mutation in an evolving population of progenitor cells ( e.g.  the @xmath0 cells of process ) of a healthy tissue .",
    "the new mutation can be either a neutral _ passenger _",
    "( @xmath13 ) , or an advantageous _ driver _ ( @xmath14 ) @xcite .",
    "model can also describe the onset of a chemotherapy resistant mutation in cancer @xcite , corresponding to the case @xmath15 , or provide a minimal model of metastasis formation , where @xmath6 cells play the role of metastasized cells @xcite .",
    "when an advantageous ( driver ) mutation appears in a supercritical process ( @xmath16 ) , model provides a detailed description of the progression of a tumor towards malignancy .",
    "this scenario occurs in models that follow the onsets of multiple mutations @xcite .",
    "such a multistage model was recently found to fit clinical data ( on the number of driver versus passenger mutations in cancer ) remarkably well @xcite .",
    "this demonstrates that branching processes can provide a quantitative descriptions of certain aspects of cancer .",
    "note that in model mutations happen at arbitrary times , which can be either a reasonable simplifying assumption , or a realistic feature when , for instance , mutations are caused by uv radiation @xcite . more often , however , mutations happen during cell divisions @xcite , which case is described by the scheme @xmath17 instead of the third process of .",
    "the solution of this alternative process goes completely analogously to that of , and is discussed in appendix [ divmut ] .",
    "the two - type process and other multi - type branching processes have been extensively studied @xcite , but the main focus was on the large time limit behavior .",
    "our results , however , are exact for any finite time , which has relevance when comparing them to experiments . multi - type branching process were generally considered intractable as even in the simplest cases one arrives to ( generally unsolvable ) riccati equations .",
    "some notable exceptions are the two - type luria - delbruck models , which describe bacteria growth in a dish , where cell death can be neglected .",
    "indeed , in the case of no death @xmath18 , model with can be turned into a much easier bernoulli equation , which leads to a simple solution @xcite .",
    "recently , however , we solved @xcite a two - type branching process with cell death , and this renewed the hope that kendall s model of tumor growth is also solvable .",

    "the full description of the dynamics of the two - type branching process is provided by the probabilities @xmath3 of having @xmath4 copies of @xmath0 and @xmath5 copies of @xmath6 at time @xmath8 .",
    "these probabilities satisfy the forward and backward kolmogorov equations @xcite . in terms of the generating function",
    "@xmath24 the _ forward _ equations reduce to a single linear partial differential equation . in this article , we shall use _ backward _ kolmogorov equations which in the present case are a pair of coupled non - linear ordinary differential equations  @xcite    [ maineqs ] @xmath25    here @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the realizations of the the generating function which only differ by their initial condition : the notation refers to the type of the single initial cell @xmath0 or @xmath6 , that is the initial conditions are respectively    @xmath28    both the positive ( gain ) terms and the negative ( loss ) terms in and correspond to the individual processes in in a straightforward way , reflecting on what happens to the initial cell . for example , since the initial @xmath0 cell divides into two @xmath0 cells at rate one , we find an @xmath29 term with coefficient one on the right hand side of .",
    "note that the forward kolmogorov equation is a first - order hyperbolic partial differential equation and hence one can analyze it using the method of characteristics .",
    "the equations for the characteristics are mathematically identical to the backward kolmogorov equations ( 10a ) and ( 10b ) , so the analytical framework ( forward or backward kolmogorov equations ) is the matter of choice ; the latter description is a little more convenient as it does not involve intermediate steps related to the characteristics .",

    "plugging into we obtain @xmath41 where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath42 .",
    "equation admits a solution in terms of the hypergeometric function .",

    "recall that @xmath49 is found from ; the proper root is @xmath50 recalling previous definitions we have @xmath51 we now compute the derivative of the hypergeometric function using identity given in appendix [ formulas ] . the original generating function @xmath26 becomes @xmath52 where we use the shorthand notation @xmath53 with @xmath54 from we determine the value of the parameter @xmath55 with @xmath56    now that we know the complete generating function @xmath57 , we immediately know e.g.  the generating function of the distribution of the number of @xmath6 cells , @xmath58 , and that of the total number of @xmath0 and @xmath6 cells , @xmath59 .",

    "we can extract @xmath3 from this solution by using cauchy s integral formula @xmath62 numerically , this inverse transformation can be efficiently performed via the fast fourier transform algorithm @xcite .",
    "the solution of the alternative process , where mutations happen at cell divisions , is given in appendix [ divmut ] .",
    "here we consider the special cases of critical dynamics of @xmath0 cells ( @xmath63 ) , that of @xmath6 cells ( @xmath13 ) , or both . if only @xmath0 cells are critical , all formulas of the previous section can be simply taken in the @xmath64 limit . if , however , @xmath6 cells are critical ( @xmath13 ) , expressions like are ill defined .",
    "this @xmath13 case for general @xmath11 is a bit cumbersome , but also implausible , as it describes a super- of subcritical population producing a completely neutral mutant .",
    "hence we only consider here the bi - critical case @xmath65 , that is when the birth and death rates of both cell types are balanced @xmath66 , @xmath67 .",
    "the behavior of critical @xmath6 cells can be obtained from by taking the @xmath68 limit @xmath69 we substitute this back to , and for @xmath70 we arrive at @xmath71 or equivalently @xmath72 in terms of the new variable @xmath73}\\ ] ] again , by writing @xmath74 , we simplify to @xmath75 , which is solved by the modified bessel functions @xmath76\\ ] ] up to an arbitrary constant . by using identities for the modified bessel functions , solution can be transformed back to the original generating function @xmath77 the parameter @xmath1 is fixed by the initial condition @xmath78 with @xmath79 this bi - critical case solution is somewhat simpler than the general solution , as it only contains low index modified bessel functions .",
    "now that we have the exact solution , let us derive some asymptotic scaling behaviors .",
    "the first task is to determine the right ( or interesting ) scaling limit . in the case of studying e.g.  only the distribution @xmath80 of one type of cells ( either @xmath0 or @xmath6 ) ,",
    "we first guess the leading order large time asymptotic of the typical number of surviving cells @xmath81 , and we study the @xmath82 , @xmath83 scaling limit , with @xmath84 kept constant .",
    "we define the scaling limit for the distribution @xmath80 of the number of cells as @xmath85 , and note that the generating function becomes a laplace transform , if we also take the @xmath86 limit , while keeping @xmath87 constant @xmath88    the scaled density @xmath89 has both a singular part describing the extinction of cells , and a regular part describing the surviving cells .",
    "the distribution of cells conditioned on survival is by definition @xmath90 , and we define its scaling limit as @xmath91 . now by treating the first term of the sum in separately , up to first order we obtain @xmath92 with the laplace transform @xmath93 where the survival probability is asymptotically @xmath94 .",
    "consequently , @xmath95 \\delta(\\hat{m } ) + s(t ) p^*(\\hat{m})$ ] .",
    "our scaling describes the fate of all surviving cells if @xmath96 is the laplace transform of a valid probability density , i.e.  if @xmath97 . but to obtain the right scaling of the surviving cell distribution , we first need to understand the asymptotic behavior of the survival probability .      from the exact expressions or for @xmath57 , we know the survival probability of @xmath0 cells @xmath98 , that of @xmath6 cells @xmath99 , and that of any cell @xmath100 at time @xmath8 .",
    "let us now use these exact expressions to understand their large time asymptotic behavior .",
    "we first consider the bi - critical case @xmath65 .",
    "it is immediate that that the survival probability of @xmath0 cells @xmath101 as @xmath82 .",
    "what is the survival probability of any cells @xmath102 ?",
    "as @xmath82 , also @xmath103 , while @xmath1 from remains constant . now using the large argument limits of the bessel functions in , we find that terms containing @xmath1 are asymptotically negligible and @xmath104 in this bi - critical case , of course , all survival probabilities @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 tend to zero , that is the eventual extinction is certain .",
    "but since @xmath107 is asymptotically much larger than @xmath105 , it means that surviving cells are typically @xmath6 cells . in other words @xmath108 , which is true in general for any parameter values due to the finite mutation rate @xmath109",
    "this strange behavior , that neutral mutants are more likely to survive than non mutants , can be generalized for multiple type processes , with successive mutations @xmath110 .",
    "it turns out that that the survival probability of @xmath111 is asymptotically @xmath112 @xcite .    in the supercritical case",
    "the survival probability is positive , hence the leading order asymptotic is constant @xmath113 .",
    "let us first assume that @xmath6 cells are supercritical @xmath14 . in this case @xmath114 , and",
    "since from and @xmath115 we find that equation reduces to @xmath116 using  we can re - write the probability to end up in the state without cells as @xmath117 for @xmath68 we recover the classical single type result @xmath118 for @xmath119 , and @xmath120 otherwise .",
    "for @xmath121 there is no effect of @xmath6 cells on the survival probability , hence the result is the same as for @xmath68 . note again that in the leading order @xmath108 for @xmath82 due to the finite mutation rate @xmath109 .",
    "note also that the asymptotic survival probability @xmath122 can be obtained without the explicit knowledge of @xmath57 , by solving the equations for @xmath123 derived from .",
    "the above calculation therefore provides a check of self - consistency .",
    "many interesting limits are worth to investigate in the simplest bi - critical case , @xmath65 , that is when the birth and death rates of both cell types are balanced @xmath67 and @xmath124 .",
    "we are going to describe the large time scaling behavior of @xmath3 in three naturally arising regions of the @xmath125 plane : ( i ) corresponds to extinction @xmath126 ; ( ii ) corresponds to the survival of only @xmath6 cells @xmath127 ; and finally ( iii ) corresponds to the survival of both types @xmath128 . for all cases of this bi - critical process ,",
    "the average number of cells behave as @xmath129 but these averages include extinct lineages as well . to find the correct scaling for each regions we need to know the corresponding typical behaviors .",
    "we understand the behavior in region ( i ) since in we already obtained that all cells go extinct asymptotically with probability @xmath130 .",
    "hence that main weight of @xmath131 is asymptotically concentrated at the origin .    before exploring the @xmath125 plane further , as a warmup ,",
    "let us first consider the behavior of @xmath0 cells alone , which sheds some light on the behavior of region ( iii ) .",
    "type @xmath0 cells are not affected by @xmath6 cells , and behave as a simple critical process , with generating function @xmath132 the average ( and typical ) number of surviving cells is asymptotically @xmath133 , hence following the above method , we need to take the @xmath134 and @xmath135 limits with @xmath136 and @xmath137 constant . in this limit",
    "we recover scaling with @xmath138 , with @xmath139 . by an inverse laplace",
    "transform we obtain an exponential density @xmath140 for the scaled number of the surviving cells .",
    "now lets look at @xmath6 cells as well . as we have shown in sec .",
    "[ ext ] , for large times if there are surviving cells , they are typically @xmath6 cells only , hence the next largest weight corresponds to region ( ii ) , that is to @xmath127 .",
    "therefore , we are interested in the distribution @xmath141 of @xmath6 cells , irrespective of @xmath0 cells . the generating function of @xmath141 is simply @xmath58 . next we need to guess the typical number of surviving @xmath6 cells in the asymptotic limit , which we set to @xmath142 .",
    "the reason is that before the extinction of @xmath0 cells a few @xmath6 cells are produced , and they behave as a single type critical branching process of rate @xmath143 , which we just discussed above .",
    "this guess will be justified by the scaling function we obtain , i.e.  by @xmath144 .",
    "alternatively , we could have just assumed a general algebraic anzatz for @xmath81 , and establish its linear time dependence from the scaling .",
    "hence we take the scaling limit @xmath82 , @xmath145 , with @xmath146 kept constant , and from and we find that both @xmath147 diverge as @xmath82 .",
    "note that although @xmath148 depends only on @xmath149 in , we formally turned that into a @xmath8 dependence from @xmath146 .",
    "therefore we use the large argument asymptotic of the modifies bessel functions , and note that @xmath150 , to obtain from the asymptotic behavior of the parameter @xmath151 .",
    "we see from that @xmath152 in the scaling limit , hence in the terms proportional to @xmath1 become negligible , and the generating function simplifies to @xmath153 . from this",
    "we recover the scaling form with @xmath154 and with @xmath155 .",
    "note that @xmath144 as required .",
    "now , by taking the inverse laplace transform of the above expression ( e.g. by integrating around the branch cut between @xmath156 and 0 ) , we find that the surviving @xmath6 cells are distributed as @xmath157\\ ] ] with the scaling variable @xmath158 .",
    "interestingly , the scaling function is independent of the mutation rate @xmath109 .",
    "note also that the above distribution has an algebraic tail @xmath159 for @xmath160 , which implies an infinite average number of cells .",
    "this is understandable , since the average number of surviving @xmath6 cells grows as @xmath161 from and , which is faster than the typical value @xmath162 we used for the scaling .",
    "the convergence to the scaling function @xmath163 for large times is illustrated in figure [ crittimes ] .",
    "of having @xmath5 copies of @xmath6 cells at time @xmath8 in the bi - critical case , that is when death and birth rates are balanced for both cell types , @xmath164 , while @xmath124 . here",
    "we present plots for mutation rate @xmath165 at several different times , calculated numerically from the exact generating function . in the simultaneous limit @xmath166 and @xmath167 being constant with @xmath168",
    ", the scaled distributions converge to a scaling limit @xmath169 given by , where @xmath170 . ]",
    "what is the distribution of cells when both type of cells are present , that is in the  bulk \" region ( iii ) ?",
    "note that the survival probability that cells of both types are still present at time @xmath8 scales asymptotically as @xmath171 .",
    "since @xmath0 cells behave critically , the number of surviving @xmath0 cells grows linearly with time , and consequently the typical number of @xmath6 cells grows as @xmath172 .",
    "this suggests to keep @xmath173 and @xmath174 constant as @xmath82 .",
    "hence in the generating function we should take the @xmath82 , @xmath175 limit , with @xmath137 and @xmath176 constant . in this limit , from and , we find again that both @xmath177 diverge as @xmath82 .",
    "consequently , all terms of parameter @xmath1 of have the same leading order behavior , and we arrive at @xmath178 therefore all terms containing bessel functions in have the same order , and we finally find that @xmath179 the scaling function of surviving @xmath0 and @xmath6 cells @xmath180 is the inverse laplace transform of in both variables @xmath181 and @xmath182 , which we could not obtain explicitely .",
    "there are many possible limits to take in a non - critial system , where @xmath183 .",
    "for example , one could consider all six possible orderings of @xmath184 .",
    "here we restrict our attention to the most interesting case , when an already advantegeous cell lineage produces an even fitter mutant , i.e.  @xmath16 .",
    "again , we are interested in the distribution @xmath141 of @xmath6 cells , irrespective of @xmath0 cells , which is given by @xmath58 .",
    "first , let us provide an intuitive reasoning for the scaling , which will be justified later .",
    "since @xmath185 , the first surviving mutant produces the dominant portion of @xmath6 cells .",
    "a single @xmath6 cell eventually survives with probability @xmath186 , and the average number of @xmath6 cells ( including extinct lineages too ) grows as @xmath187 .",
    "consequently , the average number of surviving offspring of a single initial @xmath6 cell grows as @xmath188 for @xmath82 , which we set as the typical number of surviving cells for the two type process .    hence , we study again @xmath58 in the scaling limit @xmath82 , @xmath145 , with @xmath189 being constant .",
    "let us first determine the asymptotic value of the parameter @xmath1 given in . in the scaling limit the parameter @xmath190 of diverges : @xmath191 for @xmath14 .",
    "thus we need to determine the asymptotics of functions @xmath192 which appear in .",
    "since @xmath193 ( this follows from and ; also recall that we consider @xmath150 ) , the parameter @xmath1 is actually given by @xmath194 note that @xmath195 implies @xmath196 from .",
    "however , here we obtain the limit of @xmath1 for the case @xmath197 , since this derivation is simpler , and the result is the same due to the analyticity of @xmath198 . using the identities and for the hypergeometric functions one finds @xmath199 as @xmath200 .",
    "substituting into we obtain a neat expression for the parameter @xmath201 ^ 2\\ ] ] note that this result is valid for arbitrary values of @xmath202 and @xmath203 .",
    "it is clear from that the generating function @xmath58 of @xmath141 depends on @xmath8 and @xmath149 only through @xmath1 and @xmath42 .",
    "we have just obtained @xmath1 in the scaling limit , and from we find that @xmath204 .",
    "hence analogously to the limiting form of , from the definition we obtain the laplace transform of the surviving @xmath6 cell distribution in the scaling limit @xmath205 where @xmath206 of is the leading order constant survival probability of @xmath6 cells , @xmath207 is given by with @xmath1 of .",
    "therefore technically all we should do is to inverse the laplace transform to obtain the scaling function @xmath163 for the surviving @xmath6 cells , with @xmath208 although this is easy to do numerically , analytically it is quite challenging , since the function @xmath207 involves the ratio of hypergeometric functions .",
    "this provides an example for a simple process where even the large time limit behavior is very complicated .",
    "one general comment concerns the behavior of the scaling function in the limit when the scaled variable @xmath209 is large .",
    "we anticipate a generic exponential tail , @xmath210 as @xmath160 , which implies that the laplace transform has a simple pole at @xmath211 with residue @xmath212 , that is , @xmath213 to determine @xmath214 we must therefore find a real and positive zero of function @xmath215 . for special cases of integer @xmath203 , we can explicitly compute the scaling function @xmath163 , and verify the exponential tail .",
    "we relegate these details to appendix [ exam ] .      in many biological applications",
    "the mutation rate refers to a single base pair change , which is typically very small ( in human dna the probability of such mutation is around @xmath216 per base - pair per cell division @xcite ) .",

    "conversely , the large @xmath252 series has zero radius convergence , but it is asymptotic and hence truncating it after a finite number of terms provides an excellent approximation @xcite .",
    "there are two surprising features of the scaling function @xmath255 .",

    "second , from the large @xmath252 series we find that the density has a power law tail @xmath263 , with the exponent being @xmath264 .",

    "in this paper we presented an explicit solution for a general two - type birth - death process with one - way mutations .",
    "this process was proposed by kendall @xcite to model the onset of a driver mutation in an evolving cell population .",
    "we computed the generating function  that encapsulates the probability distribution @xmath3 .",
    "the generating function can be turned into the exact probabilities @xmath3 by a fast fourier transform @xcite .",

    "[ critlimits ] how different types of scaling apply in different regions of the @xmath125 plane . for the onset of an advantegeous mutation , @xmath16 , we derived the large time scaling limit , which limit function still involved hypergeometric functions .",

    "the long term description of tumor development though must involve more than two cell types corresponding to multiple stages of tumors @xcite .",
    "these multi - type branching processes are likely too cumbersome for explicit solutions , and one needs simplifying assumptions to deduce the relevant asymptotic behavior @xcite .",

    "our sole reason to consider these special mutation rates is to make the problem more tractable , and we anticipate that the behavior is qualitatively similar for arbitrary mutation rates . indeed , when @xmath278 , equation simplifies to @xmath279 and hence becomes @xmath280\\ ] ] note that @xmath281 in this limit .",
