    "frequently used indicators , the ultraviolet ( uv ) and the optical recombination lines ( e.g. @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) give direct measures of light from young stars .",
    "however , uv and @xmath2 emissions are strongly affected by dust extinction @xcite , and @xmath3 as well as other optical recombination lines were also shown to underestimate sfrs for galaxies with high luminosity @xcite . on the other hand , since dust absorbs uv / optical light and re - emits the bulk of the energy into far - infrared ( fir ) band ( @xmath4 ) , fir emission could efficiently trace sfrs for dusty galaxies . however , fir emission is unable to trace the dust - unobscured radiation and includes part of radiation from old stellar populations .",
    "therefore the energy balance method combining the fir and uv derived sfrs were used to complement the emission from young stars not traced by fir ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "therefore , it is questionable whether the catalog data of these sources are reliable .",
    "this is confirmed by making a comparison between fisbsc fluxes and iras co - added fluxes ( figure [ fig : iras_cat ] ) , which were specially calculated for extended sources @xcite . in order to investigate the dependence of fisbsc flux on the extension of the galaxy ,",
    "the sample was divided into three sub - samples according to the size of the galaxy ( table [ tab : div ] ) .",
    "the lines in figure [ fig : iras_cat ] give predictions of the difference between two different bands by @xcite ( hereafter dh ) one - parameter constrained sed templates .",
    "the parameter @xmath24 is related to iras flux ratio @xmath25 .",
    "the @xmath26 in our sample ranges from @xmath27 to @xmath28 , and most of the galaxies have @xmath26 between @xmath29 and @xmath30 , corresponding to an @xmath24 value between @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",

    "the consistency is improved for those galaxies in ` medium ' and ` large ' subsamples , whereas the dispersion increases for the galaxies in small samples .",
    "less improvement is found at @xmath40 band , which can be explained by the relatively larger psf fwhm at this band ( @xmath41 @xmath42 , as compared with @xmath41 @xmath43 for the @xmath39 and @xmath38 bands , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at the @xmath44 band , neither fluxes derived from the diffuse maps nor those from the ircpsc are satisfying , which is due to the poor quality of this band , thus @xmath44 data were not used in the following work",
    "therefore , we kept ircpsc flux values for ` small ' sources at the @xmath45 and @xmath40 bands , and applied fluxes derived from diffuse maps to the other sources .",
    "in addition , fluxes derived from akari diffuse maps showed notably smaller measurement errors than the iras fluxes , greatly improving the data quality .",

    "( 150mm,150mm)bw_4bands_iras_dh_map.ps    note that the mir data provided by ircpsc were little affected by an extension of the source , since it applies `` auto '' fluxes by sextractor , which are suitable for both point sources and extended sources .",
    "the sed fitting program cigale @xcite was used to calculate the sfr for our sample .",
    "cigale was developed to derive highly reliable galaxy properties by fitting the uv / optical seds and the related dust emission at the same time , i.e. , the stellar population synthesized models are connected with infrared templates by the balance of the energy of dust emission and absorption .",
    "a detailed description of cigale can be found in @xcite .",
    "here we give a brief introduction to the main features .",
    "cigale allows one to use the stellar seds from models given either by @xcite or by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* pegase ) .",
    "the difference between these models is the contribution of the thermally pulsating asymptotic giant branch ( tp - agb ) stars . in pegase models ,",
    "the contribution from tp - agb stars is low @xcite .",
    "@xcite increased the contribution from tp - agb stars adopting the fuel consumption approach .",
    "@xcite shows that the insufficient consideration of tp - agb stars overestimates the stellar mass by 0.2 dex and worsens the consistency with ir observation data at a redshift of @xmath46 . at lower redshift",
    ", it is found that using different models little affects the results @xcite .",
    "therefore , the models from @xcite were preferred in this work .",
    "the kroupa imf @xcite was used to calculate the complex stellar populations ( csps ) .",
    "this code provides two scenarios of star formation : one is `` box models '' with a constant sfr , the other is `` @xmath47 models '' , for which sfr decreases exponentially with a typical decay time , @xmath47 .",
    "sfr is calculated as @xmath48 for `` box models '' and @xmath49 $ ] for `` @xmath47 models '' , where @xmath50 is the galaxy mass @xcite .",
    "cigale also allows one to apply different scenarios for young and old populations .",
    "the input sfh here is a constant burst sfh for young stellar populations , and an exponentially decreasing one for old stellar populations .",
    "thus sfrs were calculated using the formula @xmath51 , where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are fractions of young stellar populations and old stellar populations , respectively .",
    "the attenuation curve adopted by cigale is based on a law given by @xcite , with modification of the slope and/or adding a uv bump .",
    "the modification of the slope is controlled by the factor @xmath54 , i.e. , by changing @xmath55 , the slope of the attenuation curve can be modified .",
    "we only considered a modification of the slope of the attenuation law here , and no bump was introduced .",
    "cigale allows one to consider different effects of attenuation for old and young stellar populations by adding the reduction factor @xmath56 of the dust attenuation for the old stellar populations as an input parameter . for the ir part",
    ", cigale uses dh models , which is described in section 2 .",
    "then the dust emission was calculated , and by balancing the energy emitted and absorbed , the short and long wavelength parts of the model were connected .    to compute the output parameters the code provides two methods : `` sum '' and `` max '' .",
    "the former calculates the probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) by taking sums of the probability of the models in given bins of parameter space , which might cause an unintentional bias when the input parameter values are badly chosen .",
    "the latter introduces a fixed number of equally sized bins for each parameter and searches the maximum probability of models in each bin . then these maximum probabilities are taken as weights for individual bins to calculate the expectation value of the parameter .",
    "the advantage of this method is that it alleviates the dependence on the choice of parameters ( see * ? ? ? * for detail ) .",
    "therefore , we applied the `` max '' method in this work .",
    "the input parameters applied in this study were adopted from @xcite in order to obtain a stable and reliable output .",
    "since cigale is unable to trace the unobscured emission of an agn , for seyfert 1 galaxies , the output decreases the reliability @xcite . for dust - obscured agns",
    ", cigale provides models to fit the sed , and can avoid introducing any severe bias .",
    "therefore , five seyfert 1 galaxies were rejected in our sample , and other agns are marked during analysis . in order to keep the accuracy of derived sfrs , galaxies with relatively large discrepancies between observation and output spectra ( reduced @xmath57 ) were discarded as being unreliable . at first running , there were 25 such galaxies . by updating the sdss data using navigator of sdss dr7/8 instead of the original pipeline data from sdss dr7 , the reduced @xmath58 values of 17 galaxies decreased to less than 10 .",
    "four of the eight remaining galaxies had very poor quality of akari diffuse maps .",
    "the other four had large extension and brightness , which could cause incomplete flux derivation or saturation in the optical plates .",
    "considering that the number was small ( @xmath41 6% ) , these eight galaxies and five out of the 17 galaxies were discarded .",
    "therefore , reliable sfrs were derived for 140 galaxies , out of which there are 112 with available @xmath59 fluxes and 97 with @xmath60 fluxes .      for a sed fitting ,",
    "the accuracy of the output depends on the input parameters . to give proper estimates of the sfrs",
    ", the robustness of the results must be tested .",
    "a straightforward way to check the reliability of the output of cigale is to use a sample of mock galaxies with comprehensively known physical parameters .",
    "mock galaxies can be generated following a recipe in @xcite : 1 , run cigale on the data of real galaxies .",
    "for each galaxies , a best model is produced by @xmath58 minimization .",
    "then , from these models , the fluxes at each bands can be estimated .",
    "2 , add to each flux a random relative error , which is normally distributed with @xmath61 .",
    "thus , we obtain a mock catalog with flux information at every photometric band used in this study . the last step is to run the code on the mock catalog and then to compare the output parameters with the exact values provided by the best models .",
    "the result of the comparison is shown in figure [ fig : mock ] .",
    "we only present the result concerning sfrs because in this work the sfr is the only parameter that needs to be of concern .",
    "figure [ fig : mock ] shows the two quantities are well related , indicating sfrs derived here are reliable .    ( 80mm,80mm)mock_check_irc.ps",
    "as discussed in @xcite , cigale could provide stable results of sfrs as long as one constraint beyond pah band is given .",
    "we ran cigale with and without mir data to examine the influence on sfr by mir photometric data .",
    "the result shows adding the mir data or not adding has almost no influence on the resulting value of sfr ( figure [ fig : cmp_cig ] ) , while not using fisbsc data brings large uncertainties to the output , consistent with the conclusion of @xcite using sings sample .",

    "the slopes of the @xmath73-@xmath74sfr and @xmath75-@xmath74sfr relations derived here are almost equal to one , indicating the mir - sfr relations are close to linear .",

    "the calibrations given by @xcite and @xcite are based on an equation given by @xcite in which salpeter imf was used .",
    "the use of salpeter imf will cause smaller sfrs by @xmath78 dex than some other imf with a more shallow slope at low masses @xcite .",
    "therefore this effect was corrected for the results of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)filter_res.ps",
    "spitzer @xmath76 fluxes were computed from the output spectra of the cigale and filter response curves of spitzer irac and mips .",

    "the discrepancy between our results and @xcite may due to several reasons .",
    "@xcite listed factors such as the accuracy of fiber aperture corrections , the validity of the estimation of the obscuration in galaxies by using balmer decrement , the possible contamination to radio and mir emission from obscured weak agns",
    ". the larger capacity of our sample ( 79 for @xmath12 in @xcite compared with 112 in our sample ) and the wider coverage of @xmath0 band may also cause such difference .",
    "another possible reason is that the oversimplification of pah emission in dh models underestimates the @xmath12 flux and therefore gives smaller sfrs .",
    "however , this level of discrepancy is well within the scatters in equations [ equ : res09 ] .",
    "the discrepancy between @xcite and @xcite is because @xcite included @xmath12-weak h@xmath82 galaxies with lower mir luminosity @xcite .",

    "this is not surprising because the initial sample from @xcite is ir selected , which means a considerably high luminosity in ir and thus sufficient dust content and relatively high metallicity range .",
    "thus , the mir - sfr relations derived here could only be extrapolated to other high - metallicity galaxies .",
    "the situation for low metallicity galaxies is rather complicated ; since the opacity of the galaxy decreases , mir would be unable to trace most of the uv / optical photons and thus lose the ability as an sfr indicator @xcite .",
    "although agns have distinct features from normal galaxies in various physical properties , they share the same trend in the mir - sfr figures .",
    "a possible reason is that the contribution from agn component is minor ( from sed fitting , less than 15% ) , therefore the host galaxy component dominates the spectrum . to investigate the effect of agns on mir emission , we plot average seds for agns and normal galaxies in figure [ fig : ave_sed ] . on average , agns are brighter than normal galaxies at all bands , while with a lower mir/@xmath95 ratio ( table [ tab : mir_90 ] ) .",

    "<S> akari / infrared camera ( irc ) point source catalog provides a large amount of flux data at _ s9w _ ( @xmath0 ) and _ l18w _ ( @xmath1 ) bands . with the goal of constructing star - formation rate(sfr ) calculations using irc data </S>",
    "<S> , we analyzed an ir selected galex - sdss-2mass - akari(irc / far - infrared surveyor ) sample of 153 nearby galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the far - infrared fluxes were obtained from akari diffuse maps to correct the underestimation for extended sources raised by the point - spread function photometry . </S>",
    "<S> sfrs of these galaxies were derived by the spectral energy distribution fitting program cigale . in spite of complicated features contained in these bands , both the _ s9w _ and </S>",

    "<S> the sfr calibrations using _ </S>",
    "<S> s9w _ and _ l18w _ are presented for the first time . </S>",
    "<S> these calibrations agree well with previous works based on spitzer data within the scatters , and should be applicable to dust - rich galaxies . </S>"
