    "a major motivation for studying aperiodic tilings came from the physics of quasi - crystals . even though the aperiodic wang tilings and penrose tilings",
    "have already been studied in the 1960 s and the 1970 s , respectively , most of the work on this subject was made since the first discovery of a quasi - crystalline material in the 1980 s .",
    "such a material appeared to be very ordered , because its diffraction pattern showed clear peaks .",
    "however , it could not be periodic , as the diffraction pattern had symmetries which should not have occurred according to the classical periodic models of crystals . until this observation , a crystalline material was seen as a set of atoms , the position of which",
    "was determined by a regular lattice .",
    "the group of transformations of @xmath2 preserving the lattice determined the symmetries of the crystal .",
    "the appearance of quasi - crystals in physics created the need for new mathematical objects in order to model these materials .",
    "the cut and projection method plays a major role for the description of such aperiodic yet ordered sets .",
    "the general idea is to project a `` slice '' of a higher - dimensional regular lattice of @xmath3 on a subspace of dimension @xmath4 .",
    "the resulting point pattern should not be periodic , but should inherit the symmetry properties of the bigger lattice .",
    "this method actually provides important examples of tilings , such as the octagonal tilings , the dodecagonal tilings , or the icosahedral tilings .",
    "the notion of ordered point set , or ordered tiling , is ambiguous . the definition itself of what should be an ordered tiling varies accordingly to the author s preoccupations .",
    "a most common assumption is the notion of finite local complexity ( flc ) .",
    "one requires that there are only finitely many local configurations in the tiling ( up to translation ) .",
    "this is a qualitative condition on complexity . a dynamical definition of order could be recurrence of orbits for the associated dynamical system . in combinatorial terms",
    ", this corresponds to a property of repetitivity : every finite patch of the tiling appears infinitely often , and within a prescribed range depending on the size of the patch .",
    "another dynamical condition would be to require that the entropy of the dynamical system is zero . in terms of `` patch - counting entropy ''",
    ", it is equivalent to require that the growth of the patch - counting function ( which to @xmath5 associates the number of patches included in a ball of size @xmath5 ) is sub - exponential .    our approach to understand the notion of ordered point pattern involves a complexity function , as in the entropy case , but with greater precision .",
    "the notion of complexity is well defined for bi - infinite words over a finite alphabet : the function @xmath6 associated to a word @xmath7 counts the number of subwords of @xmath7 of length @xmath8 .",
    "this definition can be extended to multi - dimensional tilings , though not in a canonical way : @xmath9 should count ( up to translation ) the number of patches of size @xmath8 .",
    "this definition depends on a suitable definition of `` patch of size @xmath8 '' . while many properties are known about the complexity of one - dimensional words ( that is for one - dimensional tilings ) , the situation is not as well known for multi - dimensional tilings .    in this article , we define a notion of `` patch of size @xmath8 '' in the framework of cut and projection tilings , in order to define a complexity function .",
    "we compute this function for cut and projection tilings with almost - canonical acceptance domain .",
    "almost - canonical acceptance domains , as we will define , are a generalization of the canonical case , when the projected `` slice '' of the lattice is a cylinder , the base of which is the projection of the unit cube .",
    "almost canonical acceptance domains are domains for which it is possible to define cut hyperplanes in the `` internal space '' ( a supplementary of the `` physical space '' ) .",
    "we will prove ( theorem  [ theorem ] ) that for a cut and projection tiling of dimension @xmath4 arising as the projection of the regular lattice @xmath10 with almost - canonical acceptance domain , the complexity @xmath9 grows like @xmath11 , where @xmath0 is an integer which depends on the data of the cut and projection method .",
    "namely , it depends on the rank of the stabilizers of the cut planes , and will be computed in examples .",
    "we give bounds for @xmath0 : for a tiling with no period , we have @xmath12 ( theorems  [ theorem ] and  [ theorem - cohom ] ) .",
    "generically , the complexity is maximal , that is @xmath13 .",
    "another notion of `` ordered structure '' could be understood in terms of the topology of the tiling space .",
    "given a tiling and its associated tiling space @xmath14 , one can compute its ech cohomology .",
    "a qualitative distinction can be done between tiling spaces with finitely generated rational cohomology , and tiling spaces with infinitely generated rational cohomology .",
    "this distinction seems to characterize the difference between a topologically complex space and a topologically simpler one , and our intuition is that the class of tilings with finitely generated rational cohomology should have some specific interest , being a class of more `` ordered '' tilings .",
    "note that the cohomology groups of substitution tiling spaces are finitely generated over @xmath1 ( see  @xcite ) , as well as all the tilings which have been used to model quasi - crystals in physics .    for cut and projection tilings",
    ", there is actually a link between these two notions of order : the cohomological `` complexity '' and the growth of the complexity function @xmath15 .",
    "we prove in section  [ sec : links ] ( theorem  [ theorem - cohom ] ) that , in the case of a @xmath4-dimensional cut and projection tiling with almost - canonical acceptance domain and with no periods , the following equivalence holds : the cohomology of the tiling space is finitely generated if and only if the complexity of the tiling is low , that is @xmath9 grows like @xmath16 .",
    "such a link between high complexity and infinitely generated cohomology does not hold in a more general framework .",
    "we prove that if a word is not too complex ( which means that its complexity is dominated by @xmath17 with @xmath18 a constant ) , then its associated tiling space has finitely generated cohomology .",
    "this result is in line with the statement above , but the converse does not hold in full generality : we define a word , the complexity of which is exponential , but such that its associated tiling space has finitely generated cohomology . in order to prove these results , we prove that the tiling space of a word is homeomorphic to the inverse limit of its rauzy graphs .",
    "it was already known that the space was an inverse limit of graphs , thanks to the anderson - putnam - ghler complexes ( see  @xcite )",
    ". however , rauzy graphs are more suited than ghler complexes to understand the combinatorics of a word .",
    "our proof uses the now classical methods developed in  @xcite , or  @xcite .",
    "the questions raised in this article have interested mathematicians for some time .",
    "answers for some of these problems are already known in specific cases .",
    "the case of complexity for one - dimensional cut and projection tilings , also known as cubic billiard sequences was already investigated by  @xcite in dimension 3 , and then by  @xcite in any dimension . in these articles , an exact and explicit polynomial formula is given for the complexity function , assuming certain additional arithmetic condition .",
    "it seems however , that the complexity problem was not yet solved in a general framework .",
    "berth and vuillon obtained more precise results than ours for the complexity , in specific case of @xmath19 , @xmath20 and to a certain extend @xmath21-cut and projection tilings ( or `` discrete planes '' ) , see  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "their method consists in modifying the tiling in order to obtain a @xmath22-subshift , and study its rectangular complexity .",
    "the method used in our paper seems very similar to the one used in  @xcite in the sense that the problem of counting patches ( or words in their case ) is reduced to the problem of counting connected components of a certain set ( counting cells of a certain decomposition of the two torus , respectively ) .",
    "there are also other lines of approach to study complexity in more than one dimension : lagarias and pleasants  ( @xcite ) have worked on the complexity of general delone sets of @xmath23 .",
    "they prove results of minimal complexity .",
    "more precisely , they state the following result : assume the complexity function @xmath15 of a delone set @xmath24 satisfies @xmath25 for some @xmath26 and for some constant @xmath18 depending ( in a weak sense ) on the set",
    ". then @xmath24 is an ideal crystal , that is , its group of periods has rank @xmath4 .",
    "we prove here a result which is related to a conjecture in their article , even though we prove it for the much more specific case of cut and projection delone sets : the group of periods of a cut and projection delone set of @xmath23 is of rank at most @xmath27 , if and only if @xmath28 is bounded from below by a positive constant .",
    "however , we do not have control on the constant involved , and so this does not yet fully confirm the conjecture for almost - canonical cut and projection tilings .",
    "let @xmath3 be the standard euclidean space with basis @xmath29 , and distinguished sublattice @xmath10 . in the following",
    ", this space will be normed by the @xmath30-norm , which we will note @xmath31 , and the closed balls will be noted @xmath32 , for @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "let @xmath35 be a linear subspace of @xmath3 , @xmath36 a complementary subspace , @xmath37 and @xmath38 be the projections respectively on @xmath35 and @xmath36 , associated to the decomposition @xmath39 .",
    "we note @xmath4 the dimension of @xmath35 , and we make the following standard assumption : [ hyp ] the restriction @xmath40 is one - to - one , and @xmath41 is a dense subgroup of @xmath36 .    we define the following objects :    * the _ acceptance domain _",
    "@xmath42 is a compact subset of @xmath36 , which is the closure of its interior , and which we assume to be a convex polytope ( the closed convex hull of a finite set ) .",
    "* @xmath43 the ( finite ) set of vertices of @xmath42 . *",
    "the _ acceptance strip _ , which we note @xmath44 , is the set @xmath45 .",
    "* @xmath46 the projection of @xmath10 on @xmath36 , which we assumed to be a dense subgroup of @xmath36 ( by assumption  [ hyp ] ) .",

    "i.e.  _ the convex set @xmath47 . in the case",
    "@xmath48 , the cut and projection method is said to have _",
    "canonical acceptance domain_. one can read the article  @xcite for general results about cut and projection tilings with canonical acceptance domain , and their relation with other construction methods .    in a more general setting",
    ", we assume that the acceptance domain is _ almost - canonical _ in the following sense . from now on",
    ", we will assume that the acceptance domain is almost canonical .",
    "[ hypk ] the acceptance domain is said to be _ almost - canonical _ if the following holds : @xmath42 is a convex polytope , such that @xmath49 is a countable union of hyperplanes of @xmath36 .",
    "in addition , given any @xmath50-dimensional face @xmath51 of @xmath42 , and any vertex @xmath52 of @xmath51 , and @xmath53 the linear hyperplane parallel to @xmath51 , we assume that there is a neighborhood of @xmath54 in @xmath53 which can be covered by finitely many translates of @xmath51 of the form @xmath55 , with @xmath56 .",
    "remark that @xmath57 has non empty interior in @xmath53 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath58 is dense in @xmath53 for all hyperplanes @xmath53 , then the acceptance domain @xmath42 is almost - canonical . we will prove later that a canonical acceptance domain is almost - canonical .",
    "an almost - canonical domain is a generalization of a canonical domain which allows to define cut planes , and such that the singular points ( cf .",
    "infra ) have the same structure as in the canonical case .    the set @xmath59 is called the _ data _ of a _ @xmath60-cut and projection method_.    sometimes , the space @xmath35 ( the one which will be tiled ) , is referred to as the _ physical space _ , whereas the space @xmath36 ( which can be seen as a parameter space ) , is referred to as the _ internal space_.    a cut and projection method can allow one to construct tilings .",
    "namely , in the case of a canonical acceptance domain , a very elegant and canonical way to do so is described in  @xcite .",
    "however , we will not describe cut and projection _ tilings _ but rather cut and projection _",
    "delone sets _ , which amounts to the same when it comes to computing the complexity .",

    "this could cause an ambiguity in the definition of the cut and projection delone set associated to @xmath73 .",
    "this is why in the definition below , we only consider delone set associated to regular points .",
    "the @xmath8-regular points are an adaptation of the regular points : they are points for which it is possible to construct without ambiguity a patch of size @xmath8 in the following sense .    for all @xmath74 , we define the following objects :    * the lifted set associated to @xmath73 is : @xmath82 ; * the delone set associated to @xmath73 is : @xmath83 .    for all @xmath75 , for all @xmath79 ,",

    "remark that we chose @xmath76 for the definition of @xmath8-singular points , and hence for the definition of patches of size @xmath8 .",
    "this is because if @xmath8 is given , and one takes @xmath73 far away from @xmath35 , one can have that @xmath89 is empty . as we want to consider patches of size @xmath8 and not patches of size at most @xmath8 , we take @xmath76 in the definition of the patches .    if @xmath74 , the patch @xmath97 is a subpatch of @xmath91 , as it can be extended : it is actually a subset .",

    "that is , a patch could correspond to several pointed patches .",
    "however , the number of candidates to be the center of any patch of the form @xmath89 is bounded , and this bound only depends on the data of the cut and projection method .",
    "this fact will be proved in lemma  [ lemma - center ] .",
    "we can now define the complexity function , the function which counts the number of different patches of a given size :    let @xmath91 be a delone set .",
    "the complexity function is the function @xmath103 , such that @xmath9 is the number of subpatches of size @xmath8 of @xmath91 , up to translation by an element of @xmath35 .",
    "we can write it : @xmath104",
    "the repetitivity ensures the following property :    the complexity @xmath15 of a given delone set @xmath91 equals the complexity of any delone set @xmath105 obtained with the same cut and projection data .",
    "we deduce : @xmath106 furthermore , as we count the patches only up to translation by an element of @xmath35 , we have : @xmath107    similarly , we define the pointed complexity function , which counts the number of pointed patches up to a translation of @xmath35 :    the pointed complexity function associated to the cut and projection method is : @xmath108    the complexity function and pointed complexity function are linked by the following inequalities :    [ prop - center ] there exists @xmath109 , which only depends on the data of the cut and projection method , such that for all @xmath26 : @xmath110    we first state the following lemma , which proves the assertion of remark  [ remark - centers ] .",

    "we want to express the size of a patch of size @xmath8 in terms of the norm induced in @xmath35 by the norm of @xmath3 .",
    "remark that if @xmath26 and @xmath114 , then for all @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 but @xmath118 and @xmath42 is compact , so there exists an upper bound to @xmath119 which does not depend on @xmath120 .",
    "let us call this bound @xmath121 . then : @xmath122 and so , applying this inequality with fixed @xmath73 and all @xmath123 , we have : @xmath124 where @xmath125 stands here for the ball in @xmath35 .",
    "a consequence is that , given a patch @xmath89 , the number of different @xmath123 such that @xmath102 is bounded , and its bound does nt depend on @xmath73 . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath126 , then @xmath127 is not included in @xmath128 , so that we can not have @xmath102 .",
    "so a bound of the number of candidates for being the center of a given patch is , for example , @xmath129 , which is finite by uniform discreteness of the delone sets associated to the cut and projection data .",
    "this shows that a patch of size @xmath8 can have at most @xmath112 centers .",
    "the proposition is an immediate consequence of the lemma above : as a given patch @xmath130 has at most @xmath112 centers , it means that such a patch corresponds to at most @xmath112 pointed patches @xmath130 with distinguished point @xmath131 ( @xmath81 being a center for the patch ) .",

    "we note @xmath15 the complexity function and @xmath201 the function which counts the number of connected components of @xmath196 .",

    "let @xmath15 be the associated complexity function .",

    "our goal is to give an asymptotic estimation of @xmath195 , the number of connected components of @xmath192 .",
    "remember that the set of regular points is a convex polytope @xmath42 minus hyperplanes : @xmath251 where the @xmath158 are finite sets .",
    "similarly , one can prove that : @xmath252 the idea is to compare @xmath195 to the number of connected components of @xmath42 minus a finite number of hyperplanes in each direction .",

    "actually , the set we will count will not be exactly this one , as we will have to take into account the fact that some hyperplanes are stabilized by elements of @xmath156 .",
    "however , the idea remains the same .",
    "then , we will need to estimate the number of connected components of a compact convex subset of @xmath254 when it is cut by hyperplanes .",
    "we will state two lemmas which will answer these questions . combining these two lemmas",

    "we begin by an `` equidistribution - like '' lemma : this lemma aims at giving an estimation of the number of points of @xmath255 , when @xmath8 tends to infinity .",
    "[ lemma1 ] let @xmath36 be a @xmath15-dimensional vector space , @xmath256 be @xmath257 vectors of @xmath36 , which span a dense subgroup of rank @xmath257 ( @xmath258 ) .",
    "then for all bounded sets @xmath259 with non empty interior , there exist @xmath260 , such that for all @xmath8 , we have : @xmath261    we can apply this lemma with @xmath262 , @xmath263 , and where the @xmath264 are a system of generators of @xmath156 chosen amongst the @xmath265 . in the special case where we make the additional assumption that @xmath266 , we will have @xmath267 . in this case",
    ", this lemma states that the cardinality of @xmath268 grows like @xmath16 .",
    "this gives the cardinality of a patch of size @xmath8 .",
    "an interpretation is that the number of integer points contained in the convex set @xmath269 grows like the volume of this set , which is roughly speaking the volume of @xmath270 , that is , grows like @xmath16 , up to constants .",
    "let us first remark that by precompacity of bounded sets , it is enough to check the property for a set @xmath259 of the form @xmath271 with small @xmath272 .",
    "up to re - ordering the vectors , we assume that @xmath273 define a parallelotope of maximal volume amongst all the parallelotopes which can be formed from the @xmath274 . thus , @xmath275 form a basis of @xmath36 .",
    "let @xmath276 and @xmath277 be respectively the euclidean and sup norms associated to this basis .",
    "one can check that for all @xmath278 , we have @xmath279 .",
    "let @xmath140 be the lattice of @xmath36 generated by @xmath273 .",
    "we will prove a result of equidistribution relative to the subgroup of the torus @xmath280 generated by the vectors @xmath281 .",
    "let @xmath278 . by hypothesis , the subgroup of @xmath35 generated by all the @xmath282 is of rank @xmath257 , so that the group @xmath283 is infinite as a subgroup of @xmath284 .",

    "as we said , @xmath338 is `` almost ''",

    "cohomology first originates from algebraic topology .",
    "the idea of cohomology is to associate abelian groups ( the _ cohomology groups _ ) to a topological space @xmath226 .",
    "these groups are noted @xmath489 .",
    "the construction is functorial ( and contravariant ) in the sense that given a continuous morphism @xmath490 , then there is an induced map @xmath491 .",
    "cohomology groups can be defined by various means on topological spaces such as manifolds .",
    "we can mention for example the singular cohomology , the de  rham cohomology , of the ech cohomology . for manifolds ,",
    "these definitions agree .",
    "however , for spaces with less regularity , some definitions are more suited than others .",
    "the strength of cohomology is that it is a topological invariant .",
    "homeomorphic ( or even homotopic ) spaces have the same cohomology groups .",
    "furthermore , an exact sequence machinery exists which allows , to some extend , to compute these groups actually .",
    "tiling spaces are quite complicated topological spaces : they are everywhere locally the product of a cantor set by an euclidean ball .",
    "it appeared that the good notion of cohomology for these spaces was ech cohomology .",
    "a remarkable feature of ech cohomology is that it is well behaved towards inverse limits : the @xmath215-th ech cohomology group of an inverse limit of spaces is the direct limit of the @xmath215-th cohomology groups of these spaces .",
    "this fact led to an actual computation of cohomology groups for a subclass of tilings including some important examples .",
    "anderson and putnam  ( @xcite ) showed that substitution tiling spaces were inverse limits of simple complexes , which allowed to compute the associated invariants .    in the framework of cut and projection tiling spaces , another method exists and",
    "was carried out by forrest , hunton and kellendonk  ( @xcite ) .",
    "this method uses the fact that a group acts on the tiling space .",
    "the cohomology groups actually computed with this method are the cohomology groups of the group @xmath10 with value in a certain module of functions , and this other notion of cohomology agrees with the ech cohomology of the topological space .",
    "their computations provided a criterion for infinitely generated cohomology , which we will give below .",
    "we may wonder if complexity has a topological interpretation .",
    "indeed , intuitively , the more a tiling is complex , the less it should be repetitive . as the usual distance which defines the topology of tiling spaces ( see for example  @xcite ) is linked to the notion of recurrence of patches , complexity should have a dynamical or topological interpretation in terms of the associated tiling space .",
    "we will show that , for cut and projection tilings with almost - canonical acceptance domain , one has such a link : the cohomology of a cut and projection tiling space is finitely generated ( over @xmath1 ) if and only if its complexity grows as slow as possible .",
    "more precisely , the statement is the following :    [ theorem - cohom ] consider a cut and projection method @xmath59 which satisfies our assumptions .",
    "call @xmath492 .",
    "let @xmath15 be the associated complexity function .",
    "then there exists a constant @xmath493 such that @xmath494 with @xmath495 .",
    "the cohomology groups over @xmath1 of the associated tiling space are finitely generated if and only if the complexity is minimal , that is there exists @xmath496 such that @xmath497 .    in the following sections",
    ", we will see that this theorem is specific to cut and projection delone sets : such an equivalence is actually false in greater generality , and we will give a counter example of one of these implications in dimension one .    given a @xmath60-cut and projection method , we call @xmath137 the set of singular points , and @xmath498 the set of @xmath8-singular points .",
    "these have a structure of cell complex , and we note @xmath499 the set of @xmath27-cells of @xmath137 ( for @xmath500 ) , and @xmath501 the set of @xmath27-cells of @xmath498 .",
    "remark that @xmath499 carries naturally a @xmath156-action , induced by the translation .",
    "[ sing - k - space ] we call _ singular @xmath27-space _ an affine space of dimension @xmath27 , which is singular , and is parallel to a space of the form @xmath502 .",
    "the cohomology groups associated to a cut and projection method are finitely generated if and only if @xmath503 is finite .",
    "the theorem  [ theorem - cohom ] falls actually in two parts : first , it gives a lower bound for the exponent of the complexity .",
    "then , it makes a link with cohomology .",
    "the cohomology groups are finitely generated if and only if the exponent of the complexity is minimal .",
    "let us make a connection with our result on the minimal complexity exponent and a conjecture by lagarias and pleasant .",

    "the delone set has at least @xmath507 independent periods if and only if the quantity @xmath508 tends to zero .",
    "our method gives a rather asymptotic result , and we do not have control on the constants involved . therefore , even if we do not fully prove the conjecture in the case of cut and projection delone sets , the theorems in this article are seem to confirm the result .",
    "we do not know if our methods can be adapted to prove the conjecture .",
    "let us now prove theorem  [ theorem - cohom ] .",
    "first , remark the following .",

    "one checks easily that this application is well defined and one - to - one .",

    "the assertion above is obviously true for @xmath549 , since the set of singular @xmath50-spaces directed for by @xmath152 is included in @xmath550 for all @xmath215 , and @xmath43 is finite .",

    "* similarly , if the next letter is @xmath641 , the unique extension of @xmath627 will be @xmath797 .",
    "we have to prove that a factor of length @xmath214 which ends by @xmath798 is unique : indeed , looking at the form of @xmath759 and @xmath760 , the finite word @xmath51 is a factor of @xmath799 , which is of length greater than @xmath214 .    therefore , there exists exactly one right - special word for this value of @xmath214 .",
    "we remarked that in the case of a two - letter alphabet , the number of right - special words was equal to @xmath722 .",
    "therefore , the lemma proves ( thanks to proposition  [ bound - cohom - b ] ) that infinitely often , the rauzy graph of @xmath7 has an homology of rank two .",
    "it means that it is homotopic to a wedge of two circles .",
    "application of proposition  [ bound - cohom - b ] and lemma  [ lemma - cohom - ccl ] yields the following result :    the suspension space associated with the word @xmath7 has finitely generated cohomology over @xmath1 .",
