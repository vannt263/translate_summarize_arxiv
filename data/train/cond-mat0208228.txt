    "however , each family behaves viciously towards all the others : if two walkers from different families meet , both are annihilated .",

    "our problem has a strong resemblance to that of the intersection probabilities of brownian paths . in this case , one studies the ensemble of @xmath0 random walks in @xmath11 dimensions each of which begin a distance @xmath40 from the origin and which arrive on a hypersphere of radius @xmath41 before they cross @xmath42 , _ irrespective _ of how long this takes .",

    "however , we shall show that , for @xmath132 , the leading behaviour is independent of the precise value of these parameters ( as long as they are all strictly positive ) and , moreover , the rg fixed point , at which non - leading corrections to the asymptotic behaviour disappear , corresponds to the limit of infinite @xmath133 .    in the formal continuum limit , this corresponds to a modification of the action in the path integral @xmath134      the feynman rules for this theory are very simple@xcite and are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figrules ] .",
    "we denote averages and correlations with respect to the bare action @xmath135 by the subscript @xmath136 : averages with respect to the full action @xmath137 are denoted by @xmath138 .    * the fourier - laplace transform of the bare propagator @xmath139 is represented by a line directed towards increasing time ( conventionally , right - to - left ) . in the @xmath140 representation",

    "however , this does not exist in the formal continuum limit , because the perturbative feynman diagram expansion of @xmath151 contains ultraviolet ( short - distance or short - time ) divergences .",
    "physically this is because two walkers , having interacted once , are , in the continuum limit , likely to interact an infinite number of times as @xmath125 .",
    "this divergence may be regulated , either by imposing an explicit cut - off @xmath152 in the feynman integrals , or , more easily , by dimensional regulation . for @xmath132",
    "this field theory is renormalisable : the singular dependence on the regulator may be absorbed into a finite number of parameters . in the case of the theory of interest",
    ", this procedure is particularly simple@xcite : no renormalisation of the field @xmath153 nor of the diffusion constants is required , only a simple renormalisation of the coupling constants @xmath154 , which can be computed exactly to all orders .",
    "the lack of field and diffusion constant renormalisation holds mathematically because there are no loop corrections to the propagators .",
    "physically it is because an isolated walker does not interact , even with itself , in the absence of any branching processes .",
    "when the coupling constant renormalisation is done , all correlation functions of products of @xmath155 and @xmath156 , at _ distinct _ space - time points , have a finite limit as the regulator is removed , when expressed in terms of the renormalised couplings . the fact that the renormalised theory must be defined at some arbitrary scale then leads to rg equations . _ _    however , this procedure is not sufficient to render finite correlation functions involving so - called _ composite operators _ like @xmath157 .",
    "physically , this is because if the walkers all begin at exactly the same point , they will all annihilate each other immediately ! in order to obtain finite renormalised correlation functions , it is first necessary to point - split the fields : @xmath158 ( note that it is not necessary to split the starting points of walkers of the same family , since they do not interact . )",
    "now consider a correlation function of this product with an arbitrary product @xmath159 of fields whose time arguments are all strictly positive : @xmath160 in the cut - off theory , we could simply make a taylor expansion of this in powers of the @xmath161 .",

    "since each of the @xmath169 may acquire a nontrivial anomalous dimension through this procedure , the renormalised functions @xmath170 have a non - trivial dependence on their arguments .",
    "the important feature of ( [ ope0 ] ) is that the renormalisation constants @xmath171 are independent of @xmath159 .",
    "this we may write the _ operator product expansion _ ( ope ) @xmath172 where the ope functions @xmath173 , _ etc . _ are in general nontrivial . _ _ _ _ _ _    each term in the ope ( [ ope ] ) , when substituted into @xmath151 , will give rise to nontrivial power - law dependence on @xmath3 for @xmath132 .",
    "however , since in the noninteracting theory we know that only the first term is important as @xmath167 , we shall assume that this remains true for sufficiently small @xmath22",

    "the non - universal constant term corresponds to a finite probability that the walkers annihilate at short times , before escaping each other .",
    "this behaviour persists at higher orders in the interactions .    for @xmath132",

    "hence @xmath291 where the first term in the exponent comes from simple power counting , and the factor of 2 in the second reflects the important fact that the anomalous scaling of composite operators at different times ( and points ) is multiplicative . _",
    "_    the fact that @xmath292 is symmetric under permutations of the families @xmath293 has the important consequence that the exponents @xmath53 are also symmetric .",
    "the form of the @xmath22-expansion implies that this is true to all orders in @xmath22 .",
    "it may be traced to the operator product expansion ( [ ope ] ) : the next - to - leading terms on the right - hand side , which do not vanish on integration over the spatial coordinates must contain at least two derivatives , for example @xmath294    power - counting shows that , at @xmath51 , the contribution of such terms is at least @xmath295 down on the leading term , and therefore , for sufficiently small @xmath22 , they yield only corrections to the leading behaviour which we have computed .",
    "however , since each term in ( [ ope ] ) is renormalised separately , each gives rise to an independent scaling exponent .",
    "it is a very interesting question whether the first term in the ope is dominant all the way down to @xmath23 .",
    "such a result would imply that the asymptotic exponents ( but not necessarily the prefactors ) for the cases @xmath296 and @xmath297 , for example , are equal . yet , in one dimension , the two problems are certainly not isomorphic , because the ordering of the families along the real line makes a difference .",
    "a very similar situation occurs in the problem of intersections of families of brownian paths in two dimensions : in that case the exponents have been computed exactly@xcite and are known to be symmetric , despite the fact that the ordering of the families around the annulus is a priori relevant . in this example , this symmetry is also suggested by the @xmath22-expansion below the upper critical dimension , in this case @xmath298 @xcite .",
    "however , a recent result of bray and blythe@xcite suggests that the situation in @xmath23 is not so straightforward for our problem . in their eq .",
    "( 4 ) they report a result for the survival exponent for a single lamb , with diffusion constant @xmath299 , with @xmath300 lions to the left and @xmath301 lions to the right .",
    "the diffusion constant of the lions is @xmath302 , and their result is an expansion to first order in @xmath303 .",
    "it is reported to depend on the asymmetry @xmath304 as well as the sum @xmath305 , while our analysis shows that it should depend only on the sum , to all orders in the @xmath22-expansion .",
    "there are at least two possible resolutions :    1 .",
    "the qualitative conclusions of the @xmath22-expansion break down in @xmath23 , either because the non - leading terms in the ope dominate , or through some more systemic failure ; 2 .   for @xmath23",
    "there is a qualitative difference between the case when walkers if different families strictly can not pass each other , and that , more appropriate to the field theory approach , when the annihilation rate is finite and therefore the order along the real line is not preserved .    in any case , it may be shown , by generalising the arguments of krapivsky and redner@xcite , that for infinite annihilation rate in @xmath23 the exponents @xmath53 ( and indeed all the non - leading exponents ) , are simply related to the eigenvalues of the dirichlet problem in a certain compact region consisting of a spherical hyperpolygon on the sphere @xmath306 .",
    "thus , if the postulated symmetry were to hold , it would imply that the laplacians in different regions which are related by permutations of the @xmath49 are isospectral .",
