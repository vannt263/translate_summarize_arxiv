    "<S> we develop a spectral representation formalism to calculate the casimir force , in the non - retarded limit , or van der waals force between a spherical particle and a substrate , both with arbitrary local dielectric properties . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral formalism allows to study the system as a function of its geometrical properties separately from its dielectric properties . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated force is attractive , and at a small separations it is orders of magnitude larger for nanometric - size spheres than for micrometer particles . </S>",
    "<S> we also found that the force depends more on the dielectric properties of the sphere than of the substrate .    </S>",
    "<S> recent advances in micro and nano devices have opened the possibility of studying quantum phenomena that occur at these length scales . such is the case of the casimir force  @xcite that is a macroscopic manifestation of the quantum vacuum fluctuations , as predicted by quantum electrodynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the textbook example  @xcite consists of two parallel neutral conducting plates which attract each other . </S>",
    "<S> the first experimental measurements were done in 1951 using dielectric materials  @xcite , and in 1958 using conductors  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these measurements have large errors , and up to recently , it was possible to perform measurements with about 15% of precision on truly parallel metal surfaces  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the difficulty of keeping the two plates parallel at separations of few nanometers makes it easier to measure the casimir force between a sphere and a plane  @xcite . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , the casimir theory for parallel plates can be extended using the proximity theorem  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the approximation is valid when the minimum separation between the sphere and the plane is much smaller than the radius of the sphere . </S>",
    "<S> this theorem was employed to corroborate experimental measurements of the casimir force between a plane and a large sphere  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is well known that quantum effects become more evident as the size of the system decreases . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the question of how important are the casimir effects on nanometric - size spheres is still an open question of fundamental importance . in 1948 </S>",
    "<S> casimir and polder  @xcite calculated the force of a polarizable atom near a perfect conductor plane considering the influence of retardation , and finding a correction to the london or van der waals forces . </S>",
    "<S> retardation effects are important if we consider that the distance between the atom and the plane is larger than the characteristic length of the system . </S>",
    "<S> complementary theories are necessary to handle nanometer - size systems with real dielectric properties . within this context ford  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite calculated the force between a perfectly conducting wall and a sphere with a drude dielectric function . </S>",
    "<S> after a delicate cancelation of terms in the equations , he obtained a force that changes from attractive to repulsive in an oscillatory fashion depending on the relative distance between the sphere and the surface . </S>",
    "<S> however , this oscillatory behavior has not been observed experimentally  @xcite , and has not been predicted by other theories  @xcite .    in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we develop a spectral representation formalism to calculate the force between a sphere and a substrate . </S>",
    "<S> the advantage of this spectral representation is that we can separate the contribution of the dielectric properties of the sphere and substrate from the contribution of its geometrical properties . since results for large spheres  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and large distances  @xcite are known , we restrict ourselves to the case of nanometric - size spheres and distances of few nanometers . in this case , it is not necessary to consider retardation effects , therefore , we work in the quasi - static limit such that the radius of the sphere and the minimum separation between the sphere and the plane , are smaller than the characteristic length of the system  @xcite . in this regime , the casimir force is commonly known as the van der waals or london force  @xcite .        </S>",
    "<S> we consider a homogeneous sphere of radius @xmath0 , electrically neutral and with a local dielectric function @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the sphere is suspended at a minimum distance @xmath2 above a substrate ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 ) which is also neutral and has a local dielectric function @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the space or ambient between the sphere and substrate is vacuum ( @xmath4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field induce a polarization in the sphere which can be described by a point dipole located at its center , @xmath5 where @xmath6 / [ \\epsilon_{\\rm sph}(\\omega ) + 2\\epsilon_{\\rm amb } ] r^3 $ ] , is the polarizability of the sphere that is assumed to be polarized uniformly  @xcite , and @xmath7 is the electromagnetic field associated to the vacuum fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> we can rewrite the polarizability as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a constant and @xmath10^{-1}$ ] is a variable that only depends on the dielectric properties of the sphere and the ambient . when the sphere is near a substrate , it induces a charge distribution on the substrate that can be seen as a dipole image , such that @xmath11 where the term @xmath12 satisfies the boundary conditions of the system , being @xmath13 a diagonal matrix whose elements depend on the choice of the coordinate system , and @xmath14 / [ \\epsilon_{\\rm amb } + \\epsilon_{\\rm sub}(\\omega ) ] $ ] a the contrast factor that only depends on the dielectric properties of the substrate and the ambient . the induced charge distribution on the substrate produces a field which also modifies the sphere s dipole moment through a local field . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the total induced dipole - moment on the sphere is @xmath15 , \\label{dipolo}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the dipole - dipole interaction tensor and , in the non - retarded limit , it takes the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a unitary matrix , @xmath19 is the vector from the center of the image dipole to the center of the sphere , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> given the symmetry of the system the diagonal components of @xmath13 are ( @xmath22 ) , and there are only three independent components of @xmath16 , one perpendicular to the surface plane and two parallel to this plane .    </S>",
    "<S> the frequencies that satisfy the boundary conditions of the system are those at which the sphere is polarized . </S>",
    "<S> these frequencies are known as the proper electromagnetic modes of the system , and we denote them like @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> then , the total energy of the system is @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> a convinient way of determining these proper electromagnetic modes is using a spectral representation formalism that we derive as follows .    </S>",
    "<S> first we rewrite eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ dipolo ] ) using the expression of the polarizability from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ polariza ] ) , as @xmath25 \\cdot { \\bf p}_{\\rm sph}(\\omega ) = { \\mathbf v}^{\\rm vac } , \\label{matriz}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 , and @xmath27 $ ] is a dimensionless matrix that only depends on the geometry of the system . to find the solution of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ matriz ] ) , consider the case when @xmath28 is real , then @xmath29 is a real and symmetric matrix . in this case , we can always find a unitary transformation that diagonalizes it , @xmath30 , being @xmath31 the eigenvalues of @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the solution of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ matriz ] ) is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33^{-1}$ ] is a green s operator . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath34th element of @xmath35 can be written in terms of the unitary matrix @xmath36 as  @xcite @xmath37 the poles of @xmath35 , that is @xmath38 , give the frequencies of the proper electromagnetic modes , @xmath23 , of the system  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we now calculate the casimir interaction energy as the difference between the energy when the sphere is at a distance @xmath2 from the substrate and the energy when @xmath39 , that is , @xmath40 the eigenfrequencies @xmath41 are obtained from the poles of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ green ] ) when @xmath39 , or by substituting @xmath42 in @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> note that it is not necessary to do any renormalization or any delicate cancelation to calculate the energy . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , we can also find the density of states using the green s function definition and then calculate the energy of the system , as we show in the appendix .    </S>",
    "<S> the advantage of the spectral representation is that we can separate the contribution of the dielectric properties of the sphere from the contribution of its geometrical properties . </S>",
    "<S> as we mentioned , the material properties of the sphere are contained in the spectral variable @xmath44 , while the geometrical properties of the system , like the radius of the sphere and the separation of the sphere to the substrate are in the matrix @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , @xmath29 is a dimensionless matrix that depends on the ratio @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> its eigenvalues are independent of @xmath46 and of the dielectric properties of the sphere . and the dielectric properties of the substrate are in @xmath43 which is a real function even for dispersive materials  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a similar spectral representation was proposed years ago to study the effective dielectric properties of granular composites  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the results discuss here are calculated as follows . </S>",
    "<S> first , we construct the matrix @xmath47 for a given @xmath45 , and we diagonalize it numerically to find its eigenvalues @xmath31 . considering an explicit expression for the dielectric function of the sphere , we calculate the proper electromagnetic modes @xmath23 trough the relation @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> once we have @xmath23 , we calculate the energy according with eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ener ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> here , we use the drude model , such that @xmath49 $ ] , where @xmath50 is the plasma frequency and @xmath51 is the relaxation time . </S>",
    "<S> we present results for potassium ( k ) , gold ( au ) , silver ( ag ) and aluminum ( al ) spheres with @xmath52 , 8.55 , 9.60 , and 15.80  ev , and @xmath53 , 0.0126 , 0.00188 , and 0.04 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we have considered substrates whose dielectric function is real and constant in a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum as sapphire ( al@xmath54o@xmath55 ) , and titanium dioxide ( tio@xmath55 ) , with @xmath56 , and 7.81 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> then , the corresponding contrast factors are @xmath57 -0.516 , and -0.773 . we have also considered the case of a perfect conductor substrate ( denoted by inf ) with @xmath58 and @xmath59 .    . </S>",
    "<S> each panel shows the results for different substrates ( perfect conductor , al@xmath54o@xmath55 , and tio@xmath55).,width=499 ]    in fig .  2 </S>",
    "<S> , we show the energy as a function of @xmath45 . in general </S>",
    "<S> , we observe that the energy shows a power law of @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior is independent of the material properties , and it is inherent to the dipole - dipole interaction model . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the result found by casimir and polder  @xcite for a polarizable atom , and with the measurements by mohideen _ </S>",
    "<S> et al_.  @xcite , but it is contrary to the oscillatory behavior calculated by ford  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the value of the energy varies with the substrate , for example , at small distances it is about two times larger for a perfect conductor substrate than for al@xmath54o@xmath55 , while the tio@xmath55 case is between them . </S>",
    "<S> this is easily explained if we look at the contrast factor values for each substrate , where one can see that as @xmath61 , the energy is larger . </S>",
    "<S> for all the substrates , we found that @xmath62 becomes larger as the plasma frequency of the metal also does . in conclusion , we found that @xmath62 is large when @xmath61 and @xmath50 is large , recovering the limit for perfect conductors . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the energy is largest ( smallest ) for an al ( k ) particle over a perfect conductor ( al@xmath54o@xmath55 ) substrate . </S>",
    "<S> when the sphere is at a distance larger than @xmath63 , the energy is very similar , independently of the dielectric properties of the sphere and substrate .    . </S>",
    "<S> in the left ( right ) panel we show results for a k ( al ) sphere over an al@xmath54o@xmath55 ( inf ) substrate . </S>",
    "<S> the different curves correspond to spheres of 10  nm , 50  nm , 100  nm and 500  nm of radius.,width=523 ]    let us first analyze the force as a function of the geometrical properties , that is , as a function of @xmath0 and @xmath2 . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 we show the casimir force calculated as @xmath64 in all cases , we obtain an attractive force such that , as @xmath0 is smaller the force increases . when the sphere is almost touching the substrate ( @xmath65  </S>",
    "<S> nm ) the force is ten times larger for a sphere of @xmath66  nm than the one of @xmath67  nm , and increases fifty times for a sphere of @xmath68  nm . as a function of @xmath2 , the force for the sphere with @xmath68  nm seems to be almost constant from 0 to 40  nm compared with the other curves </S>",
    "<S> this is an artifact of the scale since all curves have a power law of @xmath69 , and they are proportional to @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that for a distance @xmath71  nm the force is larger for the smallest sphere ; however , at a larger distance the force is larger for larger spheres , while for very large distances , the force is independent of @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> . furthermore , the force for the sphere with @xmath66  nm decreases about three orders of magnitude as the separation of the sphere goes from 0 to 40  nm , independently of the dielectric properties of the system . on the other hand , with the proper combination of dielectric functions of the sphere and substrate it is possible to modulate the magnitude of the casimir force . here , we show the force for an al sphere over a perfect conductor which is one order of magnitude larger than the force between the k sphere over al@xmath54o@xmath55 , as it is expected .     for spheres of k , au , ag , and al with @xmath72  nm over al@xmath54o@xmath55 , and tio@xmath55.,width=523 ]    from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4 we analyze the force as a function of the dielectric properties of the particles and substrate . in all cases </S>",
    "<S> , we found the same dependence of the force as a function of @xmath2 , independently of the dielectric functions of both , sphere and substrate . </S>",
    "<S> although the dielectric function of the substrate is important , the dependence on the dielectric function of the sphere is more critical in the magnitude of the casimir force . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the force is larger for increasing values of @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we found that the force for an al sphere is almost ten times larger than for a k sphere . on the other hand , for a given sphere </S>",
    "<S> the casimir force increases at most by a factor of three , when the substrate is changed from al@xmath54o@xmath55 to a perfect conductor .    </S>",
    "<S> the spectral representation formalism allows us to calculate the force between a sphere and a substrate in a range of sizes and separations where the proximity theorem is not applicable . </S>",
    "<S> for example , for a au sphere of radius 100 nm on top of perfect conducting plane , the value of the casimir force using the proximity theorem yields a force about three orders of magnitude of the values obtained in this paper . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the linear dependence of the proximity theorem with the radius of the sphere and that the geometrical effects of the sphere are not included . on the other hand , systems where the proximity theorem is used , such as the experiments by the group of mohideen and collaborators  @xcite do not employ homogeneous metallic spheres , rather coated dielectric spheres , making it difficult to employ the spectral representation formalism .    in conclusion , we have developed a spectral representation formalism within the van der waals approximation to calculate the casimir force between a sphere and a substrate . </S>",
    "<S> this spectral formalism separates the geometrical properties contributions from dielectric properties contributions on the casimir effect in the non - retarded limit . </S>",
    "<S> we found that at very small distances , the force can increase orders of magnitude as the size of the particle becomes smaller . </S>",
    "<S> we have also observed that the correct choice of the dielectric properties of both , sphere and substrate , can increase or decrease the force by orders of magnitude .    </S>",
