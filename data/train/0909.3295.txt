    "the charge is quantized and electron - electron interactions modify the mesoscopic fluctuations of the conductance .",
    "the randomness of the single - particle wave functions induces randomness into the interaction matrix elements when the latter are expressed in the basis of the former .",
    "these matrix elements can be decomposed into an average and a fluctuating part .",
    "the average part of the interaction , when combined with the one - body kinetic energy and a confining potential , leads to the so - called universal hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "this universal hamiltonian includes a charging energy term and an exchange interaction term that is proportional to the square of the total spin of the dot ( an additional cooper - channel term is repulsive in a quantum dot and can be ignored ) .",
    "the fluctuating part of the interaction is suppressed by the thouless conductance @xmath0 , and in the limit @xmath1 , the dot is completely described by the universal hamiltonian .",
    "the charging energy term leads to charge quantization in a weakly coupled dot , and the conductance peak height distributions in such a dot were derived in ref .   using the rmt statistics of the single - particle wave functions .",
    "qualitative features of these peak height distributions as well as the parametric peak height correlation and the weak localization effect as a function of magnetic field  @xcite were confirmed in experiments  @xcite .",
    "remaining discrepancies between theory and experiments regarding the temperature dependence of the width of the peak spacing distribution  @xcite and the peak height distributions  @xcite at low temperatures were explained by the inclusion of the exchange interaction term of the universal hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "however , not all observed features of the peak spacing distribution can be explained by the exchange interaction alone . at low temperatures ,",
    "the spacing is given by the second - order difference of the ground - state energy versus particle number .",
    "when only charging energy is present , the peak spacing distribution is expected to be bimodal because of spin effects . the exchange interaction ( with realistic values of the exchange coupling constant in quantum dots )",
    "reduces this bimodality but can not explain its _ absence _ in the experiments  @xcite .",
    "it is then necessary to consider the effect of the fluctuating part of the interaction beyond the universal hamiltonian . in the hartree - fock - koopmans approach",
    ", the peak spacing can be expressed in terms of certain interaction matrix elements , and sufficiently large fluctuations of such matrix elements  @xcite might explain the absence of bimodality in the peak spacing distribution .",
    "it is therefore of interest to make accurate estimates of interaction matrix element fluctuations in chaotic dots .",
    "these fluctuations are determined by single - particle wave function correlations . in a diffusive dot ,",
    "such correlations are well understood and lead to an @xmath2 standard deviation in the interaction matrix elements  @xcite , where @xmath3 is the mean single - particle level spacing .",
    "peak spacing fluctuations are also affected by a one - body surface charge potential induced by the accumulation of charge on the surface of the finite dot  @xcite .",
    "matrix element fluctuations of the two - body interaction and one - body surface charge potential are also important for determining the statistical scrambling of the hartree - fock energy levels and wave functions as electrons are added to the dot  @xcite .",

    "we systematically investigate matrix element fluctuations in real chaotic billiards , for @xmath10 , corresponding roughly to the parameter range relevant for experiments ( @xmath11 electrons in the dot ) .",
    "we show that fluctuations can be significantly enhanced due to dynamical effects , e.g. , the variance may be enhanced by a factor of 3 or 4 .",
    "such enhancement can help in explaining the peak spacing distribution measured in the chaotic dots of ref .",
    "@xcite .    on the other hand , the typical fluctuations of matrix elements in chaotic dots can not explain the even broader peak spacing distributions in the experiment of ref .  .",

    "semiclassical corrections due to bounces from the dot s boundaries lead to an increase in the fluctuations , but do not correctly predict the scaling with @xmath12 in the experimentally relevant range .",
    "insight into the underlying mechanism of fluctuation enhancement is obtained by studying a quantum map model , which is described in the appendix .",

    "[ secsum ] we briefly discuss some implications of the present work for the quantitative understanding of spectral scrambling and peak spacing statistics for quantum dots in the coulomb blockade regime .",
    "here we investigate how dynamical effects modify the fluctuations of interaction matrix elements beyond our findings in the random wave model  @xcite . here and in sections [ true2body ]  [ secstaddistr ] we treat exclusively geometries displaying hard chaos .",
    "[ systems with stable or marginally stable classical trajectories will be considered in sec .  [ beyond ] . ] to this end , we will use a chaotic system shown in fig .",

    "we use a quarter - stadium instead of a full stadium shape in order to remove symmetry effects .",
    "this system has been verified numerically to be fully chaotic for the range of parameters used .",

    "the degree of chaos can be characterized for example by the lyapunov exponent @xmath19 , defined as the rate of divergence at long times of generic infinitesimally separated trajectories , @xmath20 as @xmath21 and then @xmath22 . for @xmath23 and @xmath24 ,",
    "the exponent @xmath19 takes values @xmath25 ( here @xmath26 is a typical time scale associated with one bounce in the billiard ) . when @xmath27 , @xmath28 in the same range of @xmath18 , indicating that the system is somewhat less chaotic for the smaller value of @xmath17 .",
    "other measures of the degree of chaoticity are possible and may be more relevant to the problem of matrix element fluctuations , as we will argue below . in particular , we may consider the rate @xmath29 of long - time decay of classical correlations , @xmath30 as @xmath22 , where @xmath31 is a typical function defined over the classical phase space and the average is over an energy hypersurface  @xcite .",

    ".    an important consideration in the investigation of dynamical systems , as opposed to random wave models , is the presence of boundary conditions .",
    "boundary conditions lead to friedel oscillations in the average wave function intensity at distances @xmath35 from a billiard boundary .",
    "the effect of such oscillations has recently been considered in refs .  .",
    "the choice of boundary conditions , e.g. , neumann or dirichlet , will also be seen to have significant effects on matrix element fluctuations , particularly on the fluctuations of one - body matrix elements .",
    "numerical wave functions for several values of the billiard parameters @xmath17 , @xmath18 and in various energy ranges have been calculated using a variation of the plane wave method  @xcite . at each wave number @xmath5 ,",
    "a basis consisting of plane waves supplemented by a set of @xmath36 bessel functions centered a fraction of a wavelength outside the boundary is used ; the size of the basis scales linearly with @xmath5 .",
    "singular value decomposition finds at each @xmath5 the linear combination that minimizes the integrated squared deviation along the boundary from the selected boundary condition ( dirichlet or neumann ) .",
    "finally , minima of this deviation as a function of @xmath5 indicate the correct eigenvalues of the system",
    ". tests of the method include stability with respect to changes in the basis size and comparison of the resulting density of states with the weyl formula .",
    "statistics are collected by averaging over an energy window .",
    "a straightforward estimate shows that such averaging is sufficient to give good results for matrix element variances , i.e. , the ratio of signal to statistical noise grows with increasing @xmath12 .",
    "for all numerical results that follow , we use energy windows of constant momentum width @xmath37 , e.g. , the data point @xmath38 uses all wave functions within the window @xmath39 .",
    "the weyl formula for the density of states in two dimensions implies that the number of wave functions in such a window grows linearly with @xmath12 .",
    "we first study the variance of the diagonal two - body interaction matrix elements @xmath41 , associated with a pair of electrons in distinct orbitals @xmath42 interacting via the screened coulomb force .",
    "since the screening length of the coulomb interaction in large 2d quantum dots is much smaller than the dot size , the interaction may be modeled as a contact interaction @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the dot s area , and the single - particle mean level spacing @xmath3 serves to set the energy scale  @xcite .",
    "we then have @xmath45 where the single - electron wave functions @xmath46 obey the usual normalization condition @xmath47 . to leading order in @xmath48 , the variance is then given by  @xcite : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the intensity correlator of a single - electron wave function at points @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
