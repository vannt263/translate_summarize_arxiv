    "moreover , isotope effects deriving from the differences between @xmath0-alooh and @xmath0-alood @xcite indicate that nuclear quantum effects ( nqe ) play a role , as it happens in other minerals@xcite .",
    "several studies suggested that the ionocovalent and hydrogen bonds in @xmath0-alooh become symmetric under increasing pressure , in contrast to @xmath3-alooh @xcite .",
    "recent synchrotron x - ray diffraction measurements indicated that there is a phase transition between @xmath7 and @xmath8 gpa , which is characterized by a modification of the compression properties of @xmath0-alooh @xcite .",
    "however , this technique was unable to specify whether the post - transition phase consists in disordered and asymmetric hydrogen bonds , or if they are indeed symmetric .    from the theoretical viewpoint ,",
    "ab initio calculations predicted that @xmath0-alooh undergoes a second - order phase transition from an asymmetric ( hydrogen off - centered - hoc ) with group symmetry @xmath1 to a symmetric ( hydrogen centered - hc ) structure with group symmetry @xmath2 at about @xmath9 gpa @xcite .",
    "ab initio phonon dispersion curves computed at @xmath10 k showed that there are strong modifications of the modes involving protons at the transition @xcite .",

    ".    however , the scenario for the transition in @xmath0-alooh seems to be more involved : in contrast with ice vii , it is not clear whether before the transition the protons are ordered or disordered @xcite ; moreover , @xmath0-alooh belongs to the @xmath1 space - group , a much lower symmetry than ice vii , with two inequivalent protons per unit cell in a less symmetric atomic environment .",

    "we anticipate that both thermal fluctuations and nqe play a crucial role in the modification of hydrogen bonds in @xmath0-alooh , contributing to a substantial downshift of the theoretical transition pressure , in agreement with the the experimental observations .    after presenting in section [ sec",

    "for our simulations , we use the quantum espresso package @xcite , in which we implemented the qtb method .",

    "after the @xmath46 shift , one can easily see that the @xmath1 symmetry group can be continously tranformed into the @xmath2 one ( see _ e.g. _ table [ tab : table1 ] : atomic positions from static structure optimization and corresponding experimental data ) . more specifically , concerning the proton positions which are not easily detectable by x - ray scattering and subject to relevant quantum effects such as tunneling , we denote two kinds of structures , as previously done in the literature @xcite : off - centered hydrogen ( hoc ) and centered hydrogen ( hc ) .",
    "while hydrogen in @xmath2 can only exist as hc , one can build two @xmath1 virtual structures : hoc and hc . in the former ,",
    "the atomic positions are @xmath45 , while in the latter the hydrogen positions are identical to the ones in @xmath2 .",
    "nevertheless , as a result of the loss of inversion symmetry , protons in @xmath1-hc are not at the same distance from the two inequivalent o@xmath43 and o@xmath44 and their energy landscape is not symmetric in the order parameter @xmath47 .",
    "for instance , for @xmath42 gpa ( see table [ tab : table1 ] , top ) the computed @xmath48 distances are : 1.03  and 1.57  ( @xmath1-hoc ) ; 1.22  and 1.22  ( @xmath2-hc ) .    at this stage ,",
    "table [ tab : table1 ] confirms with our static optimization data the previous ab - initio results by @xcite and @xcite and obtain quantitative agreement with experimental crystallographic data by @xcite .",
    "in addition , consecutive dynamical matrix calculations provide several negative eigenvalues and thus imaginary frequencies for the @xmath2-hc structure ( figure [ schema ] ) for @xmath49 gpa confirming that the hc structure is unstable up to that pressure in contradiction with experimental data : this means that static ab - initio optimization is unable to account for the experimentally obtained transition pressure and we can suspect that thermal effects and/or nuclear quantum effects play a significant role in this transition . furthermore , that the two structures can be transformed continuously into one another , as also shown for the high pressure data at 30 gpa in table [ tab : table1 ] , indeed allows dynamical effects to play a role in the phase transition .",
    "synchrotron x - ray experiments showed a change of compressibility of @xmath0-alooh around @xmath50 gpa @xcite .",
    "moreover , theoretical calculations conducted in the asymmetric ( @xmath1 - hoc ) and symmetric ( @xmath2 - hc ) phases yielded two distinct bulk moduli @xcite . in the asymmetric @xmath1 structure , up to @xmath12 gpa , our results from standard md runs agree with those from @xcite .",
    "the same procedure was carried out within the qtb frame : we fitted our computed @xmath51 points at @xmath35 k through two distinct vinet equations of state @xcite , one adapted for the low - pressure ( lp ) structure , the other for the high - pressure ( hp ) structure ( see figure [ eos ] ) , as done in previous studies @xcite . within this procedure , the two equations of state cross between @xmath50 and @xmath52 gpa ; accordingly , the bulk modulus of @xmath0-alooh changes from @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) gpa at low pressure to @xmath55 ( @xmath54 ) gpa at high pressure ( in both cases , @xmath56 ) .",
    "the small discrepancies with the experiments @xcite are mainly due to the gga functional , which slightly overestimates the cell parameters with respect to the experimental values .",
    "our dynamical simulations are therefore consistent with a change of compressibility in @xmath0-alooh with an increase of the bulk modulus by about @xmath57 between @xmath50 and @xmath52 gpa at @xmath35  k , which is compatible with a phase transition towards stiffer o - h - o bonds as indicated by experiments .",
    "however , given the statistical error bars , we can not demonstrate that a single equation of state can not fit our computed points and we therefore resort to more precise methods , such as the analysis of the interatomic distances and the vibrational spectra , to establish the transition pressure in the following .",
    "the o - o average distance is a relevant parameter for any transition from asymmetric o - h@xmath58o to symmetric o - h - o bonds ; indeed , in pure ice , proton tunneling and the onset of symmetrization happen at o - o distances around @xmath59  @xcite , and this is generally accepted as a good criterion for the onset of symmetrization .",
    "the average o - o distances that were computed along standard langevin and qtb simulations at @xmath35  k are reported in figure [ oo_dis ] .",
    "they are very similar , apart from larger fluctuations within the qtb framework , which are mainly due to zero - point motion .",
    "our results are in agreement with experimental data @xcite , though we slightly overestimate the o - o distance as pressure increases to about @xmath60 gpa with respect to very recent x - ray data @xcite .",
    "one may note that both experimental results and ours for the o - o distance , remain significantly above the 2.4  threshold until over 25 gpa .    in order to investigate the hydrogen bonds in @xmath0-alooh , we compute the oxygen - hydrogen ( o - h ) pair correlation function ( pcf ) , averaged over the trajectories obtained from qtb or standard langevin md ( see figure [ pcf ] ) . at low pressure ,",
    "the pcf displays two peaks indicating two distinct bond lengths : around @xmath61  for ionocovalent o - h bonds and around @xmath62  for hydrogen h@xmath58o bonds .",
    "these distances are in agreement with experimental measurements on @xmath0-alood obtained through neutron scattering around @xmath63 gpa @xcite .",
    "since nqe do not seem to affect significantly the positions of the two peaks in the pcf , the distances for hydrogen and deuterium are expected to be similar , even though quantum effects are weaker for deuterium than for protons .    upon compression ,",
    "the o - o mean distance decreases ( see figure [ oo_dis ] ) ; this is correlated with a dilatation of the o - h bond and a concomitant contraction of the h@xmath58o length . as pressure further increases , the two peaks merge until they become hardly distinguishable from one another ; at high pressures , the ionocovalent and hydrogen bonds can not be differentiated anymore .",
    "however , the pcf from the qtb simulations differ from those obtained via standard langevin md : the peaks are broader than their classical counterparts , and they merge at a lower pressure , even though the positions of the peaks are similar .",
    "moreover , the minimum of the pcf between the two peaks is much higher when nqe are taken into account , suggesting that either disorder or proton tunneling is occuring at low pressure .",
    "the pcf thus shows a merging of the two peaks , therefore indicating a structural change within the explored pressure range , however actual symmetrization does not occur : at @xmath64gpa , the oxygen - oxygen distance is larger than 2.4 ( figure [ oo_dis ] ) , while the o - h distance at the same pressure is less than 1.1 , that is , less than half the o - o distance .",
    "this means that if a structural phase transition occurs , the pcf never becomes symmetric within the explored pressure range .",
    "the analysis of the pcf in section [ sec : pcf ] does not allow to distinguish between the intrinsic width of the two peaks on the one hand and proton hopping on the other .",
    "the determination of a precise transition pressure from the computed distributions is therefore problematic .",
    "the usual relevant proton transfer coordinate in symmetrization transition is @xmath65 where d@xmath66 and d@xmath67 are the o - h distances between a given proton h and its two nearest - neighbor oxygen atoms @xcite .",
    "thus , when the proton is covalently bonded to one oxygen , we have @xmath68 while @xmath69 indicates that the proton is located at the midpoint of the o - o segment .",
    "figure [ xi ] shows the distribution of the proton transfer coordinate computed in two different ways : @xmath70 from the time - averaged atomic positions and @xmath71 from the instantaneous atomic positions .",
    "the time - averaged results show a transition to a symmetric state ( @xmath72 ) at approximately 10 gpa , which is consistent with @xmath2 space group , while the full distribution is not peaked at @xmath73 .",
    "this means that the average symmetry is that observed experimentally , but the system displays a large degree of disorder and the local instantaneous configurations may have lower symmetry than the average ones .",
    "moreover , at low pressure , the iono - covalent o - h bond is longer and the hydrogen bond shorter within qtb md with respect to classical langevin dynamics , in agreement with the results on the position of the peaks in the pcf ( see figure [ pcf ] ) .",
    "we note also that our @xmath74 from standard langevin md _",
    "i.e. _ with virtually classical protons , are in good agreement with experimental measurements on @xmath0-alood @xcite , the deuterium nucleus being heavy enough to be treated as a classical particle . moreover , we also compute the evolution of mean @xmath74 with pressure in @xmath3-alooh ( diaspore ) , where no symmetrization occurs in the pressure range studied here ( up to @xmath9 gpa ) , which is in agreement with experimental results @xcite .",
    "in addition , the distinction between results from qtb md and standard langevin md is negligible : in diaspore , nuclear quantum effects do not play any major role in the hydrogen bond behavior , in contrast with the @xmath0 phase .    a closer look to the full proton transfer coordinate distribution @xmath71 that is computed from the instantaneous atomic positions allows to obtain more detailed information on the role of thermal and nuclear quantum effects along the symmetrization of the hydrogen bonds in @xmath0-alooh . within the classical frame , @xmath71 shows a well defined maximum at @xmath75 for pressures up to @xmath76 gpa , which shifts from @xmath77  at @xmath78 gpa to @xmath79  at @xmath80 gpa . at larger pressures , the proton transfer coordinate distribution",
    "becomes flat in a distance range which contracts when @xmath81 increases .",
    "classical langevin dynamics thus suggests a transition from a proton - ordered asymmetric hydrogen bond to a dynamically disordered symmetric hydrogen bond taking place around 15 - 20 gpa , where the variance of the distribution is largest .",
    "the picture that is obtained by the dynamics with the quantum thermal bath is in striking contrast with the classical one : the proton transfer coordinate distribution is quite flat even at low pressures , with @xmath82 , which evidences the presence of a small but non null proton tunneling and a large variance - the maximum being @xmath83  at @xmath78 gpa , close to its classical counterpart .",
    "the distribution flattens and its variance lessens for increasing pressures . already at @xmath84 gpa ,",
    "the maximum @xmath85 is hardly distinguishable and @xmath86 .",
    "therefore , according to the quantum frame , @xmath0-alooh undergoes a transition from a proton - disordered asymmetric hydrogen bond to a proton - disordered symmetric hydrogen bond . by direct comparison between the two frames , quantum effects enhance the proton disorder even at low pressures and slightly downshift the transition pressure with respect to purely thermal effects .",
    "the situation is thus somewhat complex : from x - ray scattering , in which proton disorder should be barely visible , only the averaged @xmath2 symmetry can be seen at high pressure .",
    "proton tunneling at the time - scale of the experiment thus triggers the dynamical symmetrization of the hydrogen bond that leads to the @xmath2 hydrogen - centered ( hc ) phase , which is observed experimentally @xcite for larger pressures than about 8 gpa .",
    "its symmetrization from a classical viewpoint , that is when the potential felt by the protons only has one minimum , occurs at a higher pressure , around 30 gpa as found by tsuchiya et al .",
    "@xcite , as we will show in the next section that is devoted to the analysis of vibrational modes in @xmath0-alooh .",
    "as previously pointed out , the proton distribution is difficult to establish through x - ray diffraction experiments , and pair - correlation functions as obtained from simulations are not always absolutely conclusive . on the other hand ,",
    "vibrational spectroscopic measurements are an excellent means to detect experimentally phase transitions through mode softening @xcite , and it turns out these are also easily accessed through time - dependent simulations such as qtb molecular dynamics @xcite .",
    "the vibrational spectra of @xmath0-alooh are rather complex @xcite .",
    "therefore , in order to determine which phonon modes are relevant to the hydrogen bond symmetrization in @xmath0-alooh , we conduct a preliminary mode analysis via the dynamical matrix , which is computed through density functional perturbation theory @xcite at @xmath10 k and without any quantum or anharmonic effects ( section [ sec : prelim ] ) , below and above the transition . some of the relevant modes from the simulated vibrational spectra ( at ambient temperature and including nqe ) are then discussed in section [ sec : vibra ] .      in the asymmetric hydrogen bond configuration ( @xmath1 , hoc ) @xcite , the vibrations at the brillouin zone center @xmath88 consist in two high - frequency o - h stretching modes ( around @xmath89 @xmath90 at @xmath10 gpa ) , and four o - h@xmath58o bending modes between @xmath91 and @xmath92 @xmath90 .",
    "the two low - frequency bending modes vibrate in the @xmath93 direction , while the two bending modes at higher frequencies are in the @xmath94 plane , which contains the o - h@xmath58o bonds .",
    "when pressure increases , the o - h stretching mode frequencies decrease abruptly , while the bending mode frequencies increase slightly .    in the symmetric phase ( @xmath2 , hc )",
    "@xcite at @xmath42 , the two highest o - h bending modes ( around @xmath95 @xmath90 at @xmath88 ) are in the @xmath94 plane and the two lowest ones along @xmath93 vibrate in the @xmath96 - @xmath97 @xmath90 range .",
    "in contrast , the o - h stretching modes at @xmath88 have imaginary frequencies for pressures below 30 gpa ( see figure [ schema ] ) , their modulus tends to zero with increasing @xmath81 .",
    "this clearly indicates that the hc phase should be unstable below that pressure . at 30 gpa ,",
    "the stretching frequencies at the brillouin zone center become real and then increase with pressure . at @xmath98 gpa they mix with bending modes , in the 1400 - 1700 @xmath90 range and harden with further increasing pressure .    as already shown by @xcite ,",
    "this is consistent with a second - order transition from the hoc to the hc structure in @xmath0-alooh , which is accompanied by a strong softening of the o - h stretching modes .",
    "therefore , our dynamical matrix analysis at @xmath99k and without nqe confirms a transition at @xmath100 gpa , which , however is about 20gpa above the experimental transition pressure from @xcite , a far from negligible difference .",
    "moreover , the imaginary frequency o - h stretching mode also show motion of the aluminium atoms ( figure [ schema ] ) which means that the symmetry of the position thereof with respect to the hydrogen environment is unstable : this is reminiscent of the local symmetry as discussed in section [ sec : hop ] . finally , for some pressures around 30gpa , the bending and stretching modes can mix .",
    "hence , we can not simply rely on the description of the vibrations in @xmath0-alooh via the dynamical matrix approach close to the hoc - hc transition .",
    "we can indeed expect both thermal and quantum effects to allow the system to explore the anharmonic regions of phase space , as suggested by the issue of local versus average symmetric positions as done in section [ sec : hop ] for protons .",
    "thus , we turn to the study of the atomic trajectories in order to take into account the inherent anharmonicity of the system , as induced by thermal and quantum effects .",
    "nevertheless , the dynamical matrix approach allows us to choose a basis of eigenvectors - the phonon directions @xmath101 , @xmath102 $ ] - that is a key to the interpretation of the hydrogen vibrational spectra . in the @xmath1 configuration",
    ", @xmath103 is parallel to the o - o direction , while @xmath104 is orthogonal to @xmath103 in the @xmath94 plane . in the @xmath2 configuration",
    ", the o - h stretching mode eigenvector @xmath105 forms a small angle with the o - o direction , and @xmath106 is orthogonal to @xmath105 in the @xmath94 plane . in both configurations",
    ", @xmath107 is parallel to the @xmath93 direction .",
    "the eigenvectors from the two phases are quite similar : in particular , @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "therefore , the use of these eigenvectors to obtain mode - specific density of states ( see equation [ eq : proj_dos ] ) appears to be reliable in both phases . at the transition ,",
    "the oh modes can mix and become a linear combination of harmonic ones ; apart from the modes here reported , there are no others involving proton displacements in the harmonic case . therefore , the @xmath101 vectors form a minimal basis set to analyze the behavior with pressure of modes involving protons .      in order to take into account both thermal and quantum effects , as well as the anharmonicities of the system , the vibrational spectrum of hydrogen in @xmath0-alooh is calculated directly from our md simulations , through the fourier transform of the autocorrelation function involving the different nuclei @xcite . for each pressure , the hydrogen spectrum density @xmath110 is proportional to : @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the shortest o - h distance ( corresponding to the o - h ionocovalent bond ) and the sum runs over all h atoms . as @xmath110 contains information about all hydrogen vibrations , we also compute the partial spectrum densities @xmath113 in order to unravel the distinct mode contributions : @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the projection of the hydrogen position vector @xmath116 onto one of the vectors @xmath101 defined in the previous section .",
    "each partial spectrum @xmath113 then corresponds to hydrogen vibrations along the eigenvector @xmath101 . by comparing the full spectrum @xmath110 to the peaks of @xmath113",
    ", we determine the frequencies of the distinct hydrogen modes : the o - h stretching modes and the o - h@xmath58o bending modes .",
    "the evolution of these frequencies with increasing pressure is shown in figure [ spec ] , as well as the width of the corresponding peaks ( indicated by the vertical bars ) .    at low pressure , we distinguish two stretching modes at approximately @xmath117 and @xmath118 @xmath90 and two bending modes around @xmath97 @xmath90 ( in the @xmath94 plane ) and @xmath119 @xmath90 ( in the @xmath93 direction ) .",
    "these results are in very good agreement with raman measurements @xcite at ambient pressure . due to the large widths of the peaks in the calculated spectrum",
    ", we could distinguish only two high - frequency o - h stretching modes , while ohtani and coworkers observed four broad bands @xcite .",
    "tsuchiya and coworkers suggested that the presence of these multiple bands , instead of two sharp peaks as calculated in the dynamical matrix approach ( see section [ sec : prelim ] ) , is due to hydrogen disorder at low pressure @xcite , which is consistent with our results on the o - h pair correlation function . upon compression ,",
    "the o - h stretching modes soften gradually , their frequencies dropping to approximately @xmath120 and @xmath121 @xmath90 .",
    "moreover , the width of the high - frequency mode increases , which implies that the two peaks of @xmath110 merge at the transition and are no longer distinguishable .",
    "in contrast , the bending mode frequencies increase slightly with pressure . above a critical pressure ( @xmath122 gpa ) ,",
    "the o - h stretching mode frequency ( @xmath123 @xmath90 ) does not vary appreciably with pressure , at least up to @xmath12 gpa , while the bending mode frequencies increase continuously .",
    "the second o - h bending mode in the @xmath94 plane becomes distinguishable only above @xmath124 gpa .",
    "the previous trends agree with those found by tsuchiya and coworkers @xcite .",
    "the softening of the o - h stretching mode up to about @xmath50 gpa , where bending and stretching modes mix up , is consistent with a second - order phase transition as also guessed by the discontinuity of the compressibility .",
    "this is also quite close to the high - pressure behavior of the o - h vibrations during the transition from asymmetric phase vii to symmetric phase x in ice @xcite . above this critical pressure",
    ", there is a continuous hardening of the o - h - o bending modes , while the stretching mode frequencies do not vary in our pressure range ( up to @xmath12 gpa ) . by extrapolating the trends shown in figure [ spec ]",
    ", it appears that the bending modes show higher frequencies than the stretching modes above @xmath125 gpa , as also predicted by the dynamical matrix analysis in section [ sec : prelim ] .",
    "all the previous observations conspire to indicate that @xmath126 gpa is close to the critical pressure @xmath127 for the transition from a proton - disordered 2@xmath128 nm phase with asymmetric hydrogen bonds to a proton - disordered @xmath2 phase with symmetric hydrogen bonds .",
    "the proton disorder decreases with pressure and a proton - ordered @xmath2 phase with symmetric hydrogen bonds is recovered at pressures as high as @xmath129 gpa .",
    "we study the symmetrization of the hydrogen bond in the high - pressure @xmath0 phase of alooh by molecular dynamics simulations , thus including thermal effects . for the first time to our knowledge",
    ", we also include nuclear quantum effects in the description of the transition through a recent though relatively simple method - the quantum thermal bath ( qtb ) - in which semi - classical atomic trajectories fulfilling the bose - einstein statistics are generated via the contact with a stochastic bath of quantum harmonic oscillators . from a detailed comparison between three simulation frames ( static calculations , classical molecular dynamics and quantum molecular dynamics simulations )",
    "we disentangle thermal and quantum effects .",
    "the transition can be schematically depicted as proceeding from a low - pressure hydrogen off - centered ( hoc ) phase with @xmath1 space group to a more symmetric , hydrogen - centered ( hc ) phase with @xmath2 space group at high pressure .",
    "the hc-@xmath2 phase is harder than the hoc-@xmath1 one , with important consequences on the stability and mechanical properties of @xmath0-alooh in the lower earth mantle .",
    "the static calculations fully agree with previous ones @xcite indicating that a pressure as high as @xmath129 gpa is needed to stabilize the proton - ordered hc-@xmath2 phase .",
    "the apparent contradiction with recent x - ray diffraction data @xcite providing experimental evidence that the transition to the high - symmetry phase happens at much lower pressures , around 8 gpa , is solved by analyzing the role of thermal and nuclear quantum effects in the transition .",
    "the onset of proton tunneling appears at rather low pressures , below 10 gpa , which is much lower than that needed to shorten o - o distances down to @xmath130  - the usual threshold for the hydrogen - bond symmetrization @xcite .",
    "proton tunneling implies that the time - averaged proton site coincides with the o - o midpoint , although at @xmath131 gpa this is still not an equilibrium position , neither in the classical nor in the quantum frames .",
    "however , the average structure fully coincides with the hc-@xmath2 phase . any structural measurement that is recorded on larger time lapses than the proton tunneling time would therefore provides such a picture . nevertheless , only at larger pressures ( about 20 gpa when nqe are included or around 25 gpa in classical simulations , at room temperature ) the symmetric hydrogen bond corresponds to a maximum of the proton distribution .",
    "we propose that the measurement of the debye - waller factors through quasi - elastic neutron scattering @xcite could distinguish between the two regimes .    as in other order - disorder phase transitions ,",
    "the analysis of the o - h modes is crucial to point out the transition . from the trends of h - related modes with pressure , which we extracted from the dynamical simulations including nqe as well as anharmonic effects",
    ", the transition should happen at pressures as low as 10 gpa , where the o - h stretching modes considerably weaken and eventually fade out .",
    "those trends are fully consistent with the analysis of the structural observables ( average positions and pair - correlation functions ) but they yield a much clearer signature of the transition as phonon modes are directly linked with the change of character of the proton dynamics .",
    "we suggest that high - resolution vibrational spectroscopy could complement the present knowledge and contribute to better identify the precise transition pressure . in order to point out the role of nuclear quantum effects ,",
    "the experiments could be ideally conducted on both alood and alooh .",
