    "harmonics generation and wave - mixing are one of the basic phenomena of nonlinear optics which have been extensively studied both theoretically and experimentally with the advent of lasers @xcite .",
    "recent advance in laser technologies has provided ultrahigh intensities for supershort laser pulses that makes achievable non - perturbative regime of harmonic generation , which significantly extends the spectral region accessible by lasers , in particular , for short wavelengths towards vuv / xuv or even x - ray radiation @xcite .",
    "such short wavelength radiation is of great interest due to numerous significant applications , e.g. in quantum control , spectroscopy , sensing and imaging etc ..    depending on the laser - atom interaction parameters , harmonic generation may arise from bound - bound @xcite and bound - free - bound transitions via continuum spectrum @xcite .",
    "bound - bound mechanism of harmonic generation without ionization is more efficient for generation of moderately high harmonics @xcite . for this mechanism resonant interaction",
    "is of importance .",
    "besides pure theoretical interest as a simple model , resonant interaction regime exhibits significant enhancement of frequency conversion efficiencies @xcite .",
    "however , to access highly excited states of atoms / molecules by optical lasers the multiphoton excitation problem arises .",
    "required resonantly - driven multiphoton transition is effective for the systems with the mean dipole moments in the stationary states , or three - level atomic systems with close enough to each other two states and nonzero transition dipole moment between them @xcite . as a candidate",
    ", we have studied the hydrogenlike atomic and ionic systems where the atom has a mean dipole moment in the excited stationary states , because of accidental degeneracy for the orbital momentum @xcite",
    ". other interesting examples of efficient direct multiphoton excitation are molecules with a permanent dipole moments @xcite , evenly charged molecular ions at large internuclear distances @xcite , and artificial atoms @xcite realized in circuit quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) setups @xcite .    in the work @xcite we have shown that the multiphoton resonant excitation of a three - level atomic / molecular system is efficient by the two bichromatic laser fields .",
    "hence , having efficient two - color multiphoton resonant excitation scheme it is of interest to consider multicolor harmonic generation and wave - mixing processes by an atomic or molecular system under the such circumstances when only a bound states are involved in the interaction process , which is the purpose of the current paper .",
    "the presence of the second laser provides additional flexibility for the implementation of multiphoton resonance expanding the spectrum of possible combinations .",
    "moreover , two - color excitation extends accessible scattering frequencies with sum- and difference components . in the current paper , we employ analytical approach for high - order multiphoton resonant excitation of quantum systems which has been previously developed by us @xcite .",
    "expression for the time - dependent mean dipole moment describing coherent part of scattering spectrum is obtained .",
    "the results based on this expression are applied to hydrogen atom and evenly charged homonuclear diatomic molecular ion .",
    "the main spectral characteristics of the considered process are in good agreement with the results of the performed numerical calculations .",
    "estimations show that one can achieve enhanced generation of moderately high harmonics / wave - mixing via multiphoton resonant excitation by appropriate laser pulses .",
    "our interest is also motivated by the advent of circuit qed setups @xcite where one can realize artificial atoms of desired configuration .",
    "thus , the obtained results may also be is of interest for artificial atoms , and the presented results can be scaled to other systems and diverse domains of the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present the analytical model and derive the coherent contribution to the multicolor harmonic spectra . in section iii , we present some results of numerical calculations of the considered issue without a multiphoton resonant approximation and compare the obtained spectra with the analytical results . here , we consider concrete systems , such as hydrogenlike atom and evenly charged molecular ion .",
    "finally , conclusions are given in section iv .",
    "we consider a three - level quantum system interacting with the two laser fields of frequencies @xmath0 and @xmath1 as shown in fig.(1a ) .",
    "it is assumed that the system is in a @xmath2 configuration in which a pair of upper levels @xmath3 and @xmath4 with permanent dipole moments are coupled to a lower level @xmath5 .",
    "another possible three - level scheme is @xmath6 configuration shown in fig.(1b ) . in this case",
    "the lower level @xmath5 is coupled to an upper level @xmath3 which has a strong dipole coupling to an adjacent level @xmath7 .",
    "if the separation of the energy levels of the excited states is smaller than laser - atom interaction energy then by a unitary transformation @xcite the problem can be reduced to the @xmath2 configuration fig.(1a ) . as an illustrative example may serve hydrogenlike atom considered in parabolic @xcite and more conventional spherical coordinates",
    ". in parabolic coordinates , the atom has a mean dipole moment in the excited states , while in the second case because of the random degeneracy of the orbital moment there is a dipole coupling between the degenerate states , but the mean dipole moment is zero for the stationary states .",
    "the inverse with respect to the @xmath2 configuration is the polar @xmath8 configuration , which can be realized for artificial atoms @xcite .",
    "hence , as a general model we will consider the scheme of the @xmath2 configuration .",
    "type with mean dipole moments in the excited states and",
    "( b ) @xmath6 configuration with the coupling transition between the excited states .",
    "the considered configurations are unitary equivalent to each other . ]",
