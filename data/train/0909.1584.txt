    "in the realm of quantum information science one of the most pervasive obstacles that must be overcome is the effect of interactions with the environment  the resulting noise must be dealt with in any quantum system of practical interest  @xcite .",
    "the theory of quantum error correction has developed with this primary motivation in mind . the well - known passive error correction ( or error avoidance ) notions of decoherence - free subspaces ( dfs ) and noiseless subsystems ( ns )",
    "@xcite have been extensively explored .",
    "experiments have demonstrated the principle of dfss in optical systems  @xcite , ion traps  @xcite , and nmr  @xcite .",
    "the primary appeal of passive quantum error correction schemes is the fact they _ are _ passive  no correction operation is required once the noise acts .",
    "however , this occurs at the cost of a limited number of possible correctable codes for a given channel by relying heavily on symmetry in the noise  @xcite .    when dfs / ns are not available or ideal , active quantum error correction ( where a correction operation other than the identity map is needed ) must be employed , resulting in an expanded set of correctable codes .",
    "approaches such as the stabilizer formalism  @xcite provide formulas for finding and implementing codes in this regime .",
    "however , there can be a range of costs here that may negatively impact practical implementations . clearly then , there are benefits to be had in the identification of correction schemes that require the application of a recovery operation , but retain some of the appealing properties of passive codes .",
    "here we experimentally implement a non - trivial example of such a correction scheme by applying random , anticorrelated noise to a two - qubit optical system .",
    "this noisy channel leads to the loss of encoded information and has no passive codes .",
    "however , we show that one qubit can be encoded against the noise such that the encoded states are recovered with high fidelity by applying a single unitary recovery operation after each application of the noisy channel .",
    "this form of _ unitarily correctable code _ was recently introduced  @xcite .",
    "one of the most general theoretical descriptions of how to deal with environmental interactions is given by the formalism of operator quantum error correction  @xcite .",
    "in this theory , encoding , recovery and decoding of information takes place on subsystems of the full system . the key notion in operator quantum error correction",
    "is formulated as follows : a subsystem @xmath1 of @xmath2 is _ correctable _ for a quantum channel @xmath3 if there exists a recovery operation @xmath4 such that for every pair of density operators @xmath5 and @xmath6 there is some other density operator @xmath7 such that @xmath8 here @xmath9 is an ancillary subsystem , @xmath10 is an ancillary subspace orthogonal to @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the projection superoperator of @xmath13 onto @xmath11 and by a quantum channel , we refer to a completely - positive trace preserving map  @xcite",
    ". simply stated , a subsystem @xmath1 is correctable if , when we restrict our attention to it and anything it interacts with ( @xmath11 ) , there is a recovery operation that returns @xmath1 to its initial state , while doing anything to @xmath9 .",
    "decoherence - free subspaces and noiseless subsystems are two special cases of eq .",
    "( [ oqec ] ) , namely when the recovery operation is the identity map , and when @xmath14 or @xmath15 respectively .",
    "active schemes such as the stabilizer formalism are examples of eq .",
    "( [ oqec ] ) in generality .",
    "we say that a subsystem @xmath1 is _ unitarily correctable _ for a quantum channel @xmath3 if there exists a unitary recovery operation @xmath16 such that for every pair of density operators @xmath5 and @xmath6 there is some other density operator @xmath7 such that @xmath17 where @xmath16 is a unitary map such that @xmath18 , with @xmath19 a unitary operator on @xmath11 . in the general case of eq .",
    "( [ oqec ] ) , every recovery operation @xmath4 can be implemented via a unitary map on a ( in general ) larger hilbert space  @xcite .",
    "thus from another perspective , unitarily correctable codes are precisely the codes for which an extended hilbert space is not required in the recovery process",
    ".    it may not be immediately apparent why this is advantageous as it is simply a special case of eq .",
    "( [ oqec ] ) .",
    "the first point to recognize is that eq .",
    "( [ ucc ] ) is a generalization of the dfs / ns case since the identity map is a unitary map  thus the number of correction options for a given quantum channel will be at least as large .",
    "more importantly perhaps , quantum channels with _ no _ passive codes can gain _ nearly_-passive correction options .",
    "secondly , this potential increase in correction options comes only at the cost of applying a single unitary map after the noise and no measurements .",
    "thanks to these two points , unitarily correctable codes take advantage of two of the most appealing aspects of both active and passive correction schemes  increased range of correction options and easily implemented correction .    from a practical standpoint ,",
    "a correction scheme is only useful if one can find codes for which the scheme is capable of correcting a class of error operations of interest . in the case of unitarily correctable codes",
    "this can be achieved for the class of unital operations ( those for which the identity operator is unaffected by the noise @xmath20 ) as shown by theorem 2 of  @xcite .",
    "the theorem states that the unitarily correctable codes for a quantum channel @xmath3 are precisely the dfs / ns for @xmath21 , where @xmath22 denotes the dual map for @xmath3 , defined via the relation between expectation values : @xmath23 .",
    "one can readily check that @xmath3 is unital and trace preserving if and only if @xmath22 is as well .    the problem of finding the dfs / ns for a given channel has been fully characterized  @xcite . in the case of a unital channel ,",
    "the dfs / ns are the subsystems of the full hilbert space that commute with each of the kraus operators of the channel .",
    "this fact , together with theorem 2 of  @xcite provides a way to compute the unitarily correctable codes for a given unital channel .",
    "the next section includes an explicit calculation for a specific example .",
    "as a demonstrative example , we seek a simple quantum channel with no dfs / ns but with a unitarily correctable code . to that end , consider the two - qubit phase - flip channel with kraus operators @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "first note that there are no dfs / ns for this channel : @xmath3 is a unital map so we must consider the operators that commute with both @xmath27 and @xmath28 . in the standard basis , @xmath29 and , @xmath30 considering an arbitrary matrix in the hilbert space , @xmath31 : @xmath32\\\\=\\left(\\begin{array}{cccc}0&0&2m_{1,3}&2m_{1,4}\\\\0&0&2m_{2,3}&2m_{2,4}\\\\-2m_{3,1}&-2m_{3,2}&0&0\\\\-2m_{4,1}&-2m_{4,2}&0&0\\end{array}\\right).\\nonumber\\ ] ] the off - diagonal blocks must thus be equal to zero for any element of the hilbert space to commute with @xmath27 and so all elements of the hilbert space that commute with @xmath27 must be of the form ( for arbitrary @xmath33 through @xmath34 ) : @xmath35 similarly , the elements that commute with @xmath28 are : @xmath36 for arbitrary @xmath37 through @xmath38 . therefore , the only operators that commute with both @xmath27 and @xmath28 are of the form @xmath39 for arbitrary @xmath40 through @xmath41 . since there are no non - zero off - diagonal elements we can not encode any quantum information  there are no dfs / ns for @xmath3 .    however , because @xmath3 is a unital map we can find the unitarily correctable codes for @xmath3 by looking at the dfs / ns for @xmath21 .",
    "the kraus operators for the unital channel @xmath21 are @xmath42 . in the standard basis @xmath43",
    "thus the operators that commute with the kraus operators of @xmath21 are of the form @xmath44 for arbitrary @xmath33 through @xmath34 .",
    "so , there are two one - qubit unitarily correctable codes for @xmath3 ( the two one - qubit decoherence - free subspaces for @xmath21 ) : @xmath45 and @xmath46",
    ".    finally , in order to find a suitable correction operation , consider the effect of @xmath3 on an arbitrary two - qubit density matrix @xmath47 : @xmath48 there are many candidate unitary correction operations  for @xmath49 the controlled - phase gate is one  it is also easy to see that both @xmath27 and @xmath28 will correct either of @xmath49 or @xmath50 when taken as the unitary matrix of eq .",
    "( [ ucc ] ) . in any experimental setting ,",
    "some gates are easier to implement than others ( e.g. in the optical setting , 2-qubit gates are difficult because of the lack of photon - photon interactions ) . the flexibility in the choice of the unitary correction operation is another appealing aspect of unitarily correctable codes .",
    "we have found what we set out to look for , a quantum channel with no dfs / ns , but two unitarily correctable codes .",
    "although one qubit can not be encoded with no recovery operation , one can be encoded with a single unitary recovery .",
    "therefore this model allows for a clear experimental demonstration of one of the key advantages of the unitarily correctable code approach ",
    "we gain a _ nearly - passive correction scheme _ for a quantum channel with _ no passive codes_.    an additional advantage of this model is that it can be realized in an optical setting . defining @xmath51 and @xmath52",
    ", a phase - flip can be achieved by placing a half - wave plate ( hwp ) with its optic axis oriented along @xmath53 in the path of a photon .",
    "thus @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) is implemented by a hwp in the first ( second ) photon path with nothing in the second ( first ) .",
    "since both @xmath27 and @xmath28 will correct either codespace , we can experimentally implement the correction by placing a hwp in either photon path .",
    "thus , the particular optical implementation of the unitarily correctable code we consider is as follows : considering @xmath54 the full hilbert space @xmath13 is the set of polarization states of two entangled photons .",
    "@xmath13 can be decomposed as @xmath2 where @xmath14 .",
    "the single encoded qubit will be supported on @xmath55 , so @xmath56 , and the ancilla space @xmath10 is supported on @xmath57 and also has dimension @xmath58 .",
    "thus the projection superoperator @xmath12 focuses our attention onto the codespace @xmath49 : @xmath59 .",
    "the noise is provided by randomly fired anti - correlated phase - flips in both photon paths and has the form @xmath60 .",
    "finally , the correction operation is provided by a single hwp placed in the second photon path , set to apply @xmath28 , so @xmath61 .",
    "our experimental source is shown in fig .  [ experiment](a ) .",
    "we use a 185  mw free - running uv diode laser ( newport model : lqc405 - 180e , centre wavelength @xmath62  nm , bandwidth 0.8  nm fwhm ) . to improve mode quality , the beam is passed through a spatial filter to obtain a 55  mw near - tem@xmath63 beam .",
    "a motorized half - wave plate then rotates the pump polarization from horizontal to an arbitrary linear polarization .",
    "the diode laser pumps a pair of 0.5  mm thick orthogonally - oriented bibo nonlinear crystals cut for type - i non - collinear degenerate down - conversion with an 3@xmath64 half - opening angle outside the crystal @xcite . a 1  mm @xmath65-bbo and",
    "a 1  mm quartz both cut for maximum birefringence are used to compensate group - velocity mismatch in the down - conversion crystals .",
    "entangled photon pairs emitted by the source pass through bandpass filters ( centre wavelength 810  nm , bandwidth 5  nm fwhm ) and are coupled into single - mode optical fibers .",
    "the light is coupled back into free space before application of the noise , as shown in fig .",
    "[ experiment](b ) .",
    "the noise @xmath3 is implemented by a pair of computer controlled liquid - crystal variable phase retarders ( meadowlark lvc-100 , lcvr ) , one in each photon path .",
    "the lcvrs are both set to implement phase - flips . to simulate a noisy channel _ either _",
    "one or the other lcvr is randomly fired with a switching rate of @xmath66hz providing anti - correlated noise .",
    "the random switching was implemented using a software pseudo - random number generator ( labview , national instruments ) .",
    "recovery is achieved with a half - wave plate oriented along @xmath53 in the path of photon 2 .",
    "we characterize all of our states using quantum state tomography , fig  [ experiment](b ) .",
    "there is a polarization analyzer in each arm comprised of a half - wave plate , a quarter - wave plate , and a polarizing beam - splitter .",
    "we use the tomographically - overcomplete polarization measurements @xmath67 for each photon ( @xmath68 and @xmath69 represent right- and left - circular polarizations ) , i.e. , 36 measurement settings on the pair of photons .",
    "density matrices are reconstructed from the experimentally measured counts using the maximum - likelihood method @xcite .",
    "we performed quantum state tomography at each of three stages in the experiment : in the absence of noise or correction , in the presence of noise , and in the presence of both noise and correction .",
    "typical rates for the source are approximately 12000 coincidence counts / s and 60000 singles counts / s when the fibers are directly connected to detectors . using the half - wave plate placed before the down - conversion crystals , the fiber - based polarization controllers , and the tilted quarter - wave plate in the path of photon 1 , the source can produce output states in @xmath49 of the form @xmath70 with the half - wave plate oriented at @xmath71 and the phase angle at @xmath72 the system ideally produces the bell state @xmath73 . in this case , we measure visibilities of 99.2% in the horizontal / vertical ( h / v ) basis and 95.3% in the diagonal / antidiagonal ( d / a ) basis . reconstructing the state using quantum state tomography we find , in this case , that the fidelity  @xcite with @xmath74 is @xmath75 , the tangle  @xcite is @xmath76 , and the linear entropy  @xcite is @xmath77 .",
    "thus our source is capable of producing highly entangled and nearly pure states .",
    "an example set of reconstructed density matrices , chosen to show the effect of the noise and correction on a state with unequal populations , and both real and imaginary coherences , is shown in fig .",
    "[ sample2dms ] .",
    "data was accumulated for 5  s per measurement setting . the initial state is shown in fig .  [ sample2dms](a ) .",
    "this state has fidelity @xmath78 with a state in @xmath49 [ eq .  ( [ generalcodestate ] ) ] with @xmath79 and @xmath80 . subjecting the photon pairs to the noise changes the state to the one shown in fig .",
    "[ sample2dms](b ) .",
    "the fidelity of this state to the initial state in fig .",
    "[ sample2dms](a ) has been reduced to @xmath81 .",
    "qualitatively , one can see that the effect of the noise @xmath3 does not decohere these states , but rather flips the sign of both the real and imaginary coherences .",
    "the correction , @xmath16 , is implemented by placing a half - wave plate in the path of photon 2 .",
    "when the noisy state was corrected , we obtained the state shown in fig .",
    "[ sample2dms](c ) where the fidelity with the initial state has been restored to @xmath75 .",
    "the recovery of high fidelity states demonstrates the effectiveness of this unitarily correctable code .",
    "we characterized the effect of the noise and noise plus correction on a range of input states .",
    "we adjusted the source to states in @xmath49 with real coefficients ( @xmath72 ) and tuned those coefficients by adjusting the angle of the hwp in the pump laser , @xmath82 .",
    "the fidelity measurements of the noise affected states are shown in fig .",
    "[ summary2qb ] where the initial states are shown as open circles and the theoretical prediction , @xmath83 , is a solid black line .",
    "these data clearly show that the noise affects the states , but by different amounts .",
    "as expected , those states closer to the product states @xmath84 and @xmath85 , or hwp settings @xmath86 ( or @xmath87 ) and @xmath88 , respectively , are less affected by the noise ; in the case of @xmath84 and @xmath85 , the states are invariant under the noise .",
    "those states closer to the maximally entangled states @xmath89 and @xmath90 , or hwp settings @xmath91 and @xmath92 , respectively , are most affected by the noise as it drives them to nearly orthogonal states .",
    "the states are restored to greater than @xmath78 fidelity in all measurements thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of this unitarily correctable code across the entire codespace @xmath49 .",
    "we have described a simple noise model which does not have a decoherence - free subspace or noiseless subsystem but does contain two unitarily correctable codes .",
    "we have implemented this noise model by constructing a quantum channel in a physical system , namely the polarization of a pair of optical photons , in which two liquid - crystal variable phase retarders fire in an anticorrelated , but random manner .",
    "we have sent photon pairs through this noisy channel in states ranging from separable to nearly maximally entangled and compared the impact of the noise and the noise plus unitary correction on the quality of the states .",
    "our data shows that the noise can dramatically impact the fidelity of the output state with the initial , especially in the case of highly entangled states in @xmath49 .",
    "however , the unitary correction restores the state quality with fidelities greater than @xmath75 for all states in @xmath49 .",
    "our experiment shows how to translate the theory of unitarily correctable codes , a new method combining aspects of passive and active quantum error correction , into experimental realization .",
    "as these codes expand the class of nearly - passive correctable codes , it is an interesting open question as to how these approaches could be utilized in more natural physical systems , as opposed to controlled application of noise .",
