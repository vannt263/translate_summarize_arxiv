    "recently , a study of dependence by using copulas has been getting more attention in the areas of finance , actuarial science , biomedical studies and engineering because a copula function does not require a normal distribution and independent , identical distribution assumptions .",
    "furthermore , the invariance property of copula has been attractive in the finance area .",
    "but most copulas including archimedean copula family are symmetric functions so that the copula model fitting for asymmetric data is not appropriate . liebscher ( @xcite ) introduced two methods for the construction of asymmetric multivariate copulas . the first is connected with products of copulas .",
    "the second approach generalizes the archimedean copulas .",
    "the resulting copulas are asymmetric but are little extension of the parametric families of copulas .",
    "this paper proposes a new generalized copula family which include asymmetric copulas in addition to all copula families available in the current literature .",
    "we will characterize the set of all twice continuously differentiable copulas that may arise .",
    "we will start with some basic concepts of copulas in the next section . in section 3",
    "we characterize a class of differentiable copulas and state our main theorem . in section 4",
    "we will discuss some well - known copulas and introduce a new class of copulas ( asymmetric in general ) in support of our main result . finally , in section 5 , we will study the dependence structure by calculating spearman s rho and kendall s tau and describe a method to maximize and minimize spearman s rho using an approximation technique for a special class of copulas that arises from our construction .",

    "a copula is a multivariate distribution function defined on @xmath2 , with uniformly distributed marginals . in this paper , we focus on bivariate ( two - dimensional , @xmath3 ) copulas .    a bivariate copula is a function @xmath4 , which satisfies the following properties    1 .",

    "the importance of copulas has been growing because of their applications in several fields of research .",
    "their relevance primarily comes from the following theorem of sklar ( see @xcite ) :    [ sklar ] let @xmath9 and @xmath10 be two random variables with joint distribution function @xmath11 and marginal distribution functions @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively . then there exists a copula @xmath14 such that    h(x , y ) = c(f(x ) , g(y ) )    for all @xmath15 .",
    "if @xmath12 and @xmath13 are continuous , then @xmath14 is unique .",

    "conversely , if @xmath14 is a copula and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are distribution functions , then the function @xmath11 defined above is a joint distribution function with margins @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "sklar s theorem clarifies the role that copulas play in the relationship between multivariate distribution functions and their univariate margins .",
    "a proof of this theorem can be found in @xcite .",

    "this implies @xmath27 is monotonically increasing in the second variable .",

    "therefore @xmath29 is increasing in its first variable .",

    "suppose @xmath34 is a continuous real - valued function .",
    "then inequality ( [ co_pd_in ] ) can be reformulated as follows , @xmath35 integrating twice we get @xmath36 where @xmath11 and @xmath13 are two arbitrarily real - valued functions of @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively . using boundary conditions",

    "if we substitute @xmath50 for @xmath51 in equations ( [ copula1 ] ) , ( [ copula2 ] ) and ( [ copula3 ] ) , it is easy to verify that every twice continuously differentiable copula is given by ( [ copula ] ) .    to prove the other direction , we have from ( [ copula ] ) , @xmath52 , which is continuous and non - negative on @xmath53 .",

    "one importance of theorem [ mjk ] is the fact that in general there is no assumption of symmetry on @xmath56 and hence on @xmath22 . with the help of above theorem , in the next section we will construct a class of examples of non - symmetric copulas",
