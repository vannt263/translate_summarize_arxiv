    "understanding how elliptical / lenticular galaxies and the bulges of spiral galaxies form and evolve is still an open question in astronomy . in comparison with galactic disks ,",
    "the properties of spheroids suggest violent or strong perturbative processes in their formation .",
    "there are two ways to define the formation epoch of a spheroid : when most of its stars formed or when the stellar spheroid acquired its dynamical properties in violent or secular processes ( avila - reese & firmani 1999 ) . for the monolithic collapse mechanism ( eggen , lynden - bell & sandage 1962 ; chiosi & carraro 2002 ) , both epochs coincide , as spheroids form as a result of an early violent collapse and a burst of star formation ( sf ) .",
    "however , in the context of the popular hierarchical cold dark matter ( cdm ) cosmogony , disks galaxies are generic structures and spheroids may form by the mergers of these disks ( e.g. , kauffmann , white & guiderdoni 1993 ; baugh et al .",
    "1996 ) , or by secular dynamical evolution ( van den bosch 1998 ; avila - reese & firmani 1999,2000 ) . if major mergers occur at high redshifts when the disks are mostly gaseous , as appears to be the case ( e.g. , conselice et al . 2003",
    "; conselice 2006 ) , then the situation is conceptually similar to the monolithic collapse . at low redshifts most galactic disks",
    "have already transformed a large fraction of their gas into stars . in this case",
    ", spheroids may assemble by dissipationless major / minor mergers and/or by disk secular evolution .",
    "but the picture is even more complex in the hierarchical cosmogony as galaxy morphology may be continuously changing ( e.g. , steinmetz & navarro 2002 ) , depending on the mass aggregation history ( smooth accretion and violent mergers ) and environment .",
    "thus , a relevant question to answer is how the mass of early - type galaxies has been assembled .",
    "the morphological properties of nearby elliptical / lenticular ( hereafter e / s0 ) galaxies in different environments reveal important clues for understanding the nature of spheroids and their formation .",
    "the detection of fine structures , dust lanes , blue cores , nuclear disks , and peculiar kinematics in early - type galaxies , considered evidence of recent merging / accretion events ( e.g. , malin & carter 1983 ; lauer 1985 ; abraham et al . 1999 ; menanteau , abraham & ellis 2001 ; papovich et al .",

    "2002 ) . on the other hand , while the bulk of the stars in luminous cluster ellipticals are old and coeval ( e.g. , bender et al .",
    "1996 ) , in low density environments the colors and gradient colors of ellipticals suggest that recent bursts of star formation occurred ( menanteau et al .",
    "2001 ; stanford et al . 2004",
    "; menanteau et al .",
    "blue clumps in early - type galaxies have also suggested to be evidence of recent accretion episodes ( elmegreen , elmegreen & ferguson 2005 ; pasquali et al .",
    "the last authors find that the fraction of early - type galaxies with blue clumps increases at high redshift .",
    "it is also possible that elliptical galaxies , at least the massive ones , evolve through the so - called ` dry - mergers ' -major mergers between galaxies without the presence of gas , such as ellipticals .",
    "late interactions and dissipationless mergers may have a profound effect upon the population and internal morphology of early - type galaxies ( e.g. , van dokkum 2005 ; tran et al .",
    "2005 ; bell et al .",
    "2005,2006 ) , yet we know very little about how these effects occur , or their timescales .",
    "the results of numerical simulations show indeed that the outcome of the fusion of early  type galaxies ( dry merger ) are anisotropic , slowly rotating , boxy spheroids ( naab , khochfar & burkert 2006 ) , while low mass highly rotating , disky spheroids are produced typically in inequal",
    " mass spiral mergers ( naab et al . 1999 ; naab & burkert 2003 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we will study several photometric properties of 42 e / s0 galaxies in mixed pairs , where the companion is a spiral galaxy close in luminosity to the e / s0 galaxy .",
    "these early - type galaxies ( at least the most interacting ) are affected gravitationally by the perturber companion , allowing us to explore the effects of interactions in early phases of mergers involving early - type galaxies ( dry pre - mergers ) .",
    "results have shown thus far that nearby ellipticals in pairs and groups reveal a large variety of morphological and kinematic peculiarities , such as off - centering of inner versus outer isophotes , small gaseous disks , shells , counter - rotating cores , and the occurrence of sf in the recent past ( schweizer & seitzer 1992 ; longhetti et al .",
    "2000 ; tantalo & chiosi 2004 ) .",
    "there is also evidence that weak interactions ( e.g. , thomson 1991 ) have played a significant role in determining the final structure of spheroids .",
    "in addition to the traditional method of studying systems through their gross photometric properties , namely color , we study the structures of these galaxies through the concentration of stellar light ( @xmath1 ) , the asymmetry in the light distribution ( @xmath2 ) , and a measure of the clumpiness of light distributions ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "these three structural and morphological indices constitute the so - called @xmath4 system , which has been proposed to distinguish galaxies at different stages of evolution ( conselice 2003 , and references therein ; see also lotz , primack & madau 2004 , who present two more morphological parameters ) .",
    "several authors are using now the @xmath4 system to study galaxy evolution in photometric redshift surveys ( e.g. , moustakas et al .",
    "2004 ; conselice , blackburne & papovich 2005 ; cassata et al . 2005 ; menanteau et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "we use here the @xmath4 system to address how the structures of early - type galaxies change during an interaction .",
    "hernndez - toledo et al .",
    "( 2005 , hereafter h2005 ) confirmed that the @xmath4 parameters are tracers of structural , morphological and sf properties of disk galaxies during an interaction .",
    "to investigate how e / s0 galaxies respond to , and evolve , during an interaction , we use a sample of e / s0 galaxies in mixed pairs ( e / s0 + s ) , which we compare to non - interacting e / s0 s and galaxies involved in ongoing gas rich mergers ( ulirgs ) .",
    "we also discuss dynamical evolutionary mechanisms that might produce the slight structural changes we find in early - type systems involved in interactions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section 2 summarizes the main characteristics of our paired e / s0 sample , and the non - interacting e / s0 galaxy comparison sample . a brief description of the @xmath4 parameters and the methodology for measuring them in our samples",
    "is also described .",
    "section 3 presents the measured @xmath4 parameters in the @xmath7 band for paired e / s0 galaxies , and compares their loci in @xmath4 space with three other samples , namely a reference sample of e / s0 non - interacting galaxies , an interacting / merging ulirg sample , and a sample of dwarf e / s0 galaxies .",
    "we also carry out a comparison of the @xmath4 parameters of the paired sample at different wavelenghts and explore the internal morphological properties of a subsample of the most interacting e / s0s .",
    "our main results are discussed and interpreted in  4 .",
    "section 5 gives the main conclusions of the paper .",
    "for our study we analyze a collection of 42 _ mixed pairs _ ( an elliptical / lenticular , e / s0 , galaxy + a spiral , s , galaxy ) selected from one of the most complete and homogeneous sample of interacting galaxies in the literature , the catalog of isolated pairs of galaxies in the northern hemisphere ( karachentsev 1972 ) . karachentsev ( 1972 ) used a strong pair isolation criterion in terms of the apparent angular separation and angular diameter of galaxies to create a list of @xmath8 non - merging , but mostly _ dynamically bounded _ pairs .",
    "binaries selected in this way show a wide range of separations : for @xmath9 of them , the projected separation does not exceed the sum of the diameters of the member galaxies , and only @xmath10 of the systems have a separation greater than @xmath11 @xmath12kpc ( but less than @xmath13 @xmath12kpc ) .    for our sample of 42 mixed pairs ,",
    "the mean projected separation is @xmath14 @xmath15kpc , showing a wide range of morphological types , and interaction - induced features ( franco - balderas et al .",
    "2003 , 2004 , 2005 ) .",
    "since our sample is restricted to isolated environments only the intrinsic properties of individual galaxies , and the effects of mutual interactions between pair components , should affect the structures of these galaxies .",
    "the sample was observed in the johnson - cousins @xmath0 photometric system with the only criterion of availability of time and good weather conditions .",
    "the images were acquired using two telescopes : the observatorio astronmico nacional ( oan ) 1.5 meter and 0.84 meter telescopes at san pedro mrtir , baja california , in mxico , and under reasonable seeing conditions ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the data are sensitive enough to detect faint stellar tidal structures and at a typical size of @xmath17 arcsec / galaxy , an average of 30 resolution elements / galaxy are reasonable enough to avoid underestimations of the @xmath4 parameters .",

    "the basic selection criteria were : not belonging to any catalogued rich group and cluster of galaxies , not having companions in a neighborhood of 0.5 mpc ( projected on the sky ) and relative redshift lower than 600 km / s . after inspecting each galaxy in sky survey images for significant companions in a 30 arcsec radius ( projected on the sky ) a final sample of @xmath24 isolated e / s0 galaxies",

    "5 that the @xmath4 parameters of interacting e / s0 s are far from those of the ulirg and dwarf e samples .",
    "ulirgs imply mergers with a significant fraction of gas , more easily detected through their larger asymmetry and clumpiness ( e.g. , c2003 ; lotz et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "figure 6 shows the @xmath4 parameters vs. corrected absolute @xmath42band magnitude m@xmath74 , @xmath75 color index , central velocity dispersion @xmath76 in logarithmic scale , and the continuum 20 cm of the luminosity l@xmath77 also in logarithmic scale , for paired e / s0 ( open symbols ) and non - interacting e / s0 sample ( crosses ) galaxies .",
    "color data for the paired galaxies were taken from our photometric studies ( franco - balderas et al .",
    "2003 , 2004 , 2005 ) , while absolute magnitudes and velocity dispersions were taken from the hyperleda database .",
    "magnitudes , colors , and velocity dispersions for the reference sample were also taken from hyperleda database , while @xmath78 luminosity was estimated from data compiled from the nrao / vla sky survey at 20 cm ( nvss ) for both samples .",
    "for both the paired and non - interacting e / s0 s samples there are no significant correlations between @xmath4 parameters and m@xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and l@xmath77 .",
    "the loci of paired e / s0 s galaxies in all the diagrams of fig .",
    "6 shows again more scatter than that of non - interacting galaxies but clear and systematic differences are not appreciated , except for the @xmath4 vs @xmath75 color plots . while no non - interacting e / s0 galaxies have @xmath79 , a high fraction of the most asymmetric and clumped paired e / s0 galaxies are bluer than @xmath80 .",
    "in general , paired e / s0 s contain a larger distribution of colors ( @xmath81 ) than the non - interacting e / s0 s ( @xmath82 ) , and on average the former are slightly bluer than the latter ( @xmath83 , and @xmath84 , respectively ) , showing that sf in the recent past could likely be induced to some level by gas accreted from the spiral companion .",
    "this conclusion is somehow reinforced by the surprising nvss radio detection fraction found in the e / s0 components in our sample of mixed pairs ( see last panel of figure 6 and domingue et al . 2005 ) suggesting that the gas giving rise to this effect may be acquired from the gas rich companion .",
    "if e / s0 galaxies in mixed pairs originate in a similar way as the isolated e / s0 ones and therefore have similar initial @xmath4 parameters , then it is important to understand how , as a consequence of the interaction , @xmath2 becomes larger at least for a subset of the paired e / s0 s .",
    "these galaxies may well represent the properties of early - type galaxies in the phase of `` dry '' pre - merging .",
    "numerical simulations of e+e interpenetrating encounters have shown that @xmath85 deformations are common when the pericenter is comparable or less than the characteristic size of the system . at large interacting distances",
    "the @xmath85 term disappears and the bi - symmetric ( @xmath86 ) term dominates ( combes et al .",
    "the signature of @xmath85 deformations include off - centering of inner isophotes compared to the outer ones , which on its own will cause an asymmetry signature .",
    "the numerical simulations also show that the intermediate and outer envelopes remain off - centered or asymmetric for only a few @xmath87 years after the pericenter passage ( combes et al .",
    "1995 ; see also aguilar & white 1985 ) .",
    "although very noisy , a loose trend of decreasing @xmath2 as @xmath63 is larger ( fig .",
    "4 ) is observed , possibly reflecting the short time scales of @xmath85 deformations .",
    "it could be expected that collisionless spheroids expand during interactions as orbital energy of the perturber is transferred to internal energy of the spheroid ( e.g. , aguilar & white 1985 ; namboodiri 1995 ; vergne & muzzio 1995 ; evstigneeva , reshetnikov & sotnikova 2002 ) . however , as all these authors show , the process is much more complex and depends on several initial and physical conditions of the pair , for example the mass ratio of the intervening galaxies , orbital parameters , strength of the interaction , and initial structure of the components .",
    "furthermore , the shape of the surface density profile is expected to change during the interaction , reaching its equilibrium state after several crossing times . in this scenario ,",
    "a unique global parameter like @xmath1 will not be sensitive enough to describe all ( global and local ) structural changes and transient processes associated with the interaction .",
    "we have found that the concentration index tends to be the same in paired e / s0 galaxies as in the non - interacting e / s0 s , but with a larger dispersion for the e / s0 sample , showing this the diversity of dynamical evolutionary stages through which the pairs are observed .",
    "this is consistent with results from several numerical simulations . in these simulations",
    "there are cases when the galaxy s surface density profile becomes more compact .",
    "simulations of spheroids with density profiles given by the de vaucouleurs models that are tidally perturbed by encounters show that strong collisions produce a final shrinkage in the effective radius and a brightening in the effective surface brightness , whereas weak collisions have the opposite effect ( aguilar & white 1985 ) .",
    "however , during early stages of the interaction the profiles flatten externally and deform .",
    "aguilar & white ( 1985 ) conclude that the effects of tidal encounters in the luminosity profiles can only be recognized immediately after a close passage .",
    "on the other hand , we caution that the concentration index does not describe in detail the diversity of luminosity distributions",
    ". it could be that in some cases the expansion is efficient only in the outer , less bounded regions , in such a way that @xmath88 increases but @xmath89 remains almost constant or even decreases ( e.g. , see namboodiri 1995 for head - on e+e simulations ) .",
    "therefore , the concentration index will `` formally '' increase in spite of the profile shows an outer expansion .    the @xmath4 parameters of e / s0 s do not change much during an interaction , in comparison to interacting disk galaxies . the structures of spheroid dominated galaxies also show less distortion during a merger than a pure disk system in n - body models ( conselice 2006 ) .",
    "the small observed change of e / s0 galaxy properties with interaction agrees with the fact that early - type galaxies are typically dense , concentrated , dynamically hot structures with low gas fractions which are slowly rotating .",
    "furthermore , the interacting s0 galaxies have @xmath4 values closer to the non - interacting ellipticals rather than to the interacting spirals , implying thick , hot and gas - poor disks , which do not strongly react to the interaction .",
    "finally , we consider the possibility that the differences seen between e / s0s in mixed pairs and non - interacting e / s0 s are due to differences in their formation processes rather than to the interaction as disscused above .",
    "the e / s0 s in pairs could originate from disks ( sa - sb galaxies ) by secular mechanisms amplified by interactions .",
    "however , the interacting spirals have @xmath4 parameters ( see h2005 ) that are very different than those in the paired e / s0 galaxies ; unless the transition is very quick , which is unlikely , this result does not support the secular mechanism of e / s0 formation in pairs . in the secular scenario",
    "it is also expected that the formed pseudo - spheroid will have a significant level of rotation .",
    "numerical simulations show that the level of asymmetry , including off - centering , in spheroids is much more pronounced if they are rotating ( combes et al .",
    "thus , the relative low level of asymmetry measured in the paired e / s0 galaxies suggests that the rotation of these galaxies is probably slow , and thus do not originate from latter hubble types .",
    "conselice ( 2003 ) , and more recently h2005 , have inferred statistical criteria for identifying galaxy major pre - mergers based on their @xmath4 parameters .",
    "thus , interacting disk galaxies can be identified by their @xmath4 values in an automated way in high - redshift samples .",
    "it would be useful to have the analogous criteria for finding pre - merging e / s0 s , and whether they meet the criteria for interaction established in c2003 , and conselice et al .",
    "( 2000a , b ) .    for our sample of e / s0 galaxies in mixed pairs , we have found some evidence of systematically higher asymmetries than in the non - interacting e / s0 galaxies .",
    "in particular , for the apparently most interacting e / s0 galaxies , the @xmath2 parameter can be several times larger than the typical @xmath2 value of non - interacting early - type galaxies .",
    "however , even in these cases , the value of @xmath2 is not larger than 0.35 , which was suggested as a rough criterion of ongoing merger or interaction for disk galaxies ( c2003 ; h2005 ) .",
    "this indicates that the structures of e / s0 s are very robust to changes due to interactions because of their high stellar mass density and likely dark matter concentrations , and/or a lack of gas content and slow rotation .",
    "this is an indication that mergers between evolved galaxies without significant gas , the so - called ` dry mergers ' , would be underestimated in merger studies that rely on morphology .",
    "studies that use pair techniques to find mergers ( e.g. , bundy et al . 2004 ; lin et al .",
    "2004 ) might be necessary to fully account for these systems .",
    "the introduction of more morphological indicators , as the gini coefficient and @xmath90 , seem to be also of utility ( lotz et al .",
    "2004,2006 ) . as a result",
    ", it is very likely that the progenitors of mergers found at high redshift are gas - rich disk galaxies rather than ellipticals ( conselice et al .",
    "2003a , b ) .    based on our results , we can develop a loose structural criteria for finding early - type galaxies perturbed by a companion of nearly similar luminosity ( mass ) . in our non - interacting sample of e / s0 s , approximately @xmath91 have asymmetries smaller than 0.05 , while for our paired e / s0 sample , @xmath92 of the galaxies have @xmath2 values smaller than 0.05 .",
    "all of these galaxies are in pairs with morphological indices that reflect weak evidence of tidal distortions .",
    "one may therefore roughly define @xmath93 as the transition value from non - interacting to interacting e / s0 galaxies , although reaching this level of accuracy in the asymmetry index at high redshift is difficult ( conselice et al .",
    "2000a ) .",
    "since there is some trend of @xmath2 with @xmath3 for both the paired and non - interacting e / s0 galaxies ( fig .",
    "5 ) , it is important to explore the deviations of paired from non - interacting galaxies in the @xmath68 plane .",
    "we define the normalized deviation @xmath94 as @xmath95 , where the numerator is the residual of the observed @xmath2 value of a paired e / s0 galaxy with respect to a linear bisector fitting to the sample of non - interacting e / s0 galaxies in the @xmath68 plane ,",
    "@xmath96 , and @xmath97 is the variance of the fitting . the deviations of paired e / s0 s from the non - interacting ones in the @xmath68 plane can be as large as @xmath98 . in fig .",
    "7 we plot @xmath94 vs @xmath2 for our e / s0 pair sample .",
    "most galaxies have @xmath99 , and @xmath94 increases as @xmath2 is higher , i.e. the @xmath3 parameter of paired e / s0 s increases with @xmath2 at a slower rate than in the case of the non - interacting e / s0 s .",
    "this is evidence that the sf does not increase significantly even for galaxies with relatively large asymmetries , i.e. galaxies with significant interaction .    in fig .",
    "7 galaxies are coded according to the interaction indices introduced by karachentsev ( 1972 ) .",
    "the index assignment is based on a visual inspection of morphological characteristics of the system components .",
    "the @xmath100 index is designated for pairs with components in a common luminous halo with an amorphous , shredded , or asymmetric structure .",
    "@xmath101 pairs show evidence of tidal bridges , tails or both in discernible components .",
    "@xmath102 pairs show evidence of structural distortion in one or both of the separated components .",
    "finally , a @xmath103 index is introduced for wide pairs with no obvious morphological distortions .",
    "the order @xmath104 has been suggested ( hernndez - toledo et al .",
    "2001 ) as a sequence from strongest to weakest evidence for tidal distortion in the pair or , alternatively , most to least dynamically evolved .    from fig .",
    "7 one infers that a statistical criterion for finding presumably interacting e / s0 galaxies might be @xmath105 and @xmath106 , the former being the stronger criterion .",
    "the galaxies below these criteria belong to pairs with weak evidence of interaction ( interaction indexes @xmath102 and @xmath103 , and @xmath44 ) . from an inspection of fig .",
    "5 , one might complement the above criteria of presumably interacting early - type galaxies with the extra conditions @xmath107 ( valid also for the non - interacting e / s0 s ) , and @xmath108 ( see regions enclosed by solid lines in fig . 5 ) .",
    "we further analyze the subsample of e / s0 galaxies with @xmath109 to look for the presence of any internal / external morphological signatures .",
    "notice that some of them are identified as e / s0s in close pairs ( @xmath110 ) and their light had to be decontaminated by the presence of the spiral companion ( see  2.5 ) .    observations of close encounters involving an early - type galaxy reveal that morphological signatures of interactions are often weak ; tidal tails are broad and of low surface brightness . our ability to detect low surface brightness features",
    "is limited by the extent of the features , confusion with neighboring objects , contrast of the image and other effects .",
    "we proceed to look for the presence of tidal external signatures by analyzing our imges via unsharp masking to the complete image frame ( including the spiral companion ) .",
    "next , the light distribution in each e / s0 companion is modelled by using the galfit package ( peng et al .",
    "this elliptical model is then subtracted from the original image to look for internal structure in a residual image .",
    "additionally , a @xmath111 color - index map is obtained to complement our search of tidal / localized features .",
    "figure 10 illustrate the results of our image analysis for 3 representative galaxies from the subsample of the most interacting e / s0 galaxies with @xmath109 .    for the subsample of the most interacting e / s0 galaxies with @xmath109 ,",
    "5 e / s0s show clear central elongated or disky structures , 6 e / s0s show 1 or 2 localized clumps along the face of the galaxy , and 3 e / s0s show evidence of shell - like structures .",
    "these results are consistent with recent studies of local isolated ellipticals surveyed for internal structures ( colbert et al .",
    "2001 ; reda et al .",
    "2004 ) and elliptical galaxies in the ultra deep field ( elmegreen et al . 2005 ; pasquali et al .",
    "2006 ) . whether these structures are produced by the interaction or not , the presence of central disks ( in a few cases ) that might react to the interaction as well as the presence of localized clumps out of the central regions could lead to a formal increase of the asymmetry parameter .",
    "this is further confirmed by viewing the residual map from the asymmetry computation .",
    "the cases with localized blue clumps are probably related to enhanced sf in a particular region of the galaxy .",
    "however , this can not be associated with a global increase of the sf activity , as typically happens in interacting spiral galaxies , where the @xmath3 parameter is systematically enhanced overall the galaxy image .",
    "thus , from our preliminary image analysis of the subset of presumably interacting e / s0 galaxies , we conclude that the observed internal / external structures deviced in these galaxies are consistent with their observed levels of asymmetry and clumpiness .",
    "if the above morphological features are interpreted as signatures of past and ongoing interactions in these pairs , it is important then to have an estimate of their timescale of merging .",
    "following patton et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , we assume that the timescale for merging of inequal mass galaxies can be approximated by the dynamical friction timescale .",
    "we use the mean values of the @xmath42band magnitude , projected separation ( it gives a lower limit to the physical separation @xmath112 ) , and relative velocity of the subsample of 17 e / s0 s with @xmath113 : @xmath114 , 22 kpc , and 125 km / s , respectively .",
    "thus , assuming @xmath115 for these e / s0 galaxies , the average dynamical friction ( merging ) timescale of the subsample is @xmath116 gyr , which is relatively short . for nearly - equal mass pairs ,",
    "an alternative estimate for the merger timescale is provided by just the circular orbit timescale , @xmath117 , where @xmath118 is the galaxy circular velocity , related to the effective velocity dispersion by @xmath119 .",
    "this effective velocity dispersion is smaller than the central one , @xmath76 .",
    "assuming an effective velocity disspersion @xmath120km / s for the subsample of highly assymetric e / s0 s , we estimate an average merger timescale of @xmath121 gyr .      on the ground of semi - analytic models and simulations , it was proposed that the local population of ellipticals assembled a significant fraction of their masses via late major ( `` dry '' ) mergers ( kauffmann & haehnelt 2000 ; khochfar & burkert 2003 ; domnguez - tenreiro et al .",
    "non - dissipative mergers seem to be the main mechanism to produce the present - day massive anisotropic , slowly rotating and boxy ellipticals ( naab et al .",
    "recently , from an analysis of tidal features associated with bright red galaxies , van dokkum ( 2005 ; see also tran et al .",
    "2005 ) has found that @xmath122 of early - type galaxies experienced a `` dry '' major merger involving more than 20% of its final mass .",
    "the e / s0 s in mixed pairs analyzed here , at least those with clear signatures of interactions , may serve as local examples of the population of early - type galaxies in a previous stage to a major merger at higher redshifts . thus , according to our results , the @xmath4 criteria of pre - merger precursors of bright ellipticals should be @xmath113 , and @xmath108 ( see above and fig . 5 ) .",
    "we note that several of the interacting e / s0 s have colors slightly bluer than the non - interacting e / s0 s (  3.4 and fig .",
    "6 ) .    finally , in fig .",
    "9 we ressume how the classification of various galaxies is envisaged from the point of view of @xmath4 planes .",
    "the average and @xmath73 dispersion @xmath4 values of non - interacting isolated ( crossed bars ) and interacting ( circled bars ) galaxies in different morphological - type ranges are shown . for the interacting galaxies , we use the subsets of paired e / s0 s ( this paper ) , and",

    "<S> we present a structural and photometric analysis of 42 elliptical / lenticular galaxies in ( e / s0 + s ) pairs observed in the @xmath0 color bands . </S>",
    "<S> the aim of the analysis is to empirically determine the effects of interactions on their morphology , structure and stellar populations as seen from the light concentration ( @xmath1 ) , asymmetry ( @xmath2 ) , and clumpiness ( @xmath3 ) parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we further compare these values to a control sample of 67 mostly isolated non - interacting e / s0 galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the paired e / s0 galaxies occupy a more scattered loci in @xmath4 space than non - interacting e / s0 s , and that the effects of interactions on e / s0 s are minor , in contrast to disk galaxies involved in interactions . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that observational methods for recognizing interactions at high redshift , such the @xmath4 methodology of conselice ( 2003 ) , would hardly detect e / s0 s involved in interactions ( related to early phases of the so called ` dry - mergers ' ) , and that the majority of interacting galaxies identified at high redshift must be gas dominated systems . </S>",
    "<S> we however find statistical differences in the asymmetry index when comparing isolated and interacting e / s0s . in the mean , </S>",
    "<S> paired e / s0 galaxies have @xmath2 values @xmath5 times larger than the ones of non - interacting e / s0 s . </S>",
    "<S> for the subset of presumably strongly interacting e / s0 s , @xmath2 and @xmath3 can be several times larger than the typical values of the isolated e / s0 s . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the asymmetries are consistent with several internal and external morphological distortions . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the subset of interacting e / s0s should be dense , gas poor galaxies in systems spaning a wide range of interaction stages , with typical merging timescales @xmath6 gyr . </S>",
    "<S> we use the observed phenomenology of this subsample to predict the approximate loci of ` dry pre - mergers ' in the @xmath4 parameter space . </S>"
