    "the physics of one - dimensional ( 1d ) conductors is substantially different compared to two- or three - dimensional systems .",
    "theory shows that the effects of electronic interaction in an electron gas have to be treated in a completely different way in one dimension compared to three dimensions .",
    "the resulting non - fermi - liquid metallic state is called the luttinger liquid ( ll ) state;@xcite it is characterized by a vanishing step in the occupation function leading to a power - law behavior in numerous physical quantities . in the case of a half - filled conduction band coulomb repulsion results in a 1d mott insulating state .",
    "these phenomena are realized in highly anisotropic systems consisting of well - separated chains or stacks of structural entities . in practice , however , a certain coupling between the 1d stacks is unavoidable , that can be described by a transverse hopping integral @xmath2 .",
    "since this implies a possible charge transport normal to the chains , the system becomes _ quasi_-1d .",
    "if the interchain coupling is strong enough , i.e. , if @xmath2 exceeds a critical value @xmath3 , the mott insulating state is suppressed.@xcite in other words : for @xmath4 the single - particle interchain hopping is completely absent for @xmath5 and the system is a 1d mott insulator .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath6 interchain transport is present ; the electrons are not confined to the stacks any more and the system is in a quasi-1d metallic state .",
    "the critical value @xmath3 for this deconfinement transition is given by the energy scale of the electronic correlations , i.e. , @xmath3 should be comparable to the value of the mott gap @xmath7@xmath8@xmath9 with the prefactor @xmath10.@xcite     when the transverse hopping integral @xmath11 reaches a critical value @xmath12 . at high enough temperature ,",
    "the increase in @xmath11 leads to a transition from a mott insulator to a 1d luttinger liquid ( ll ) state and , with further increase in @xmath11 to a dimensional crossover to a higher - dimensional metal ( hdm ) . ]    ideally , the deconfinement transition is a quantum phase transition that can take place at zero temperature when the interchain coupling is varied.@xcite the mott insulator becomes a correlated metal ( two or three dimensional ) due to the finite interchain coupling .",
    "the 1d ll state is the consequence of the smearing of the fermi - dirac distribution at high enough temperatures to mask the warping of the open fermi surface due to the interchain coupling @xmath11 .",
    "hence , the deconfinement at temperatures @xmath13 leads to a ll metallic state . when the interchain coupling becomes stronger , eventually a dimensional crossover from a ll to a higher - dimensional metallic state is induced ; it can also be reached when the temperature drops .",
    "this dimensional crossover occurs when the warping of the fermi surface ( proportional to @xmath14 ) exceeds the energy of thermal fluctuations , i.e. , @xmath15 .",
    "the higher - dimensional metallic state can be described by fermi - liquid theory ; its physical properties are distinctly different compared to the ll state.@xcite all these phenomena are summarized in the phase diagram sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram ] .",
    "well - known models of quasi-1d systems are the fabre salts ( tmttf)@xmath16 and the bechgaard salts ( tmtsf)@xmath16 .",
    "@xcite they consist of molecular stacks formed by tmttf or tmtsf cations ( which stands for tetramethyltetrathiafulvalene and tetramethyltetraselenafulvalene , respectively).@xcite since half an electron is transferred from each organic molecule to the anions @xmath17 , the band is three - quarter filled ; the systems become effectively half filled because tmtsf and tmttf form dimers .",
    "charge transport occurs along the @xmath18 axis due to overlap of electronic orbitals of sulfur or selenium atoms , respectively .",
    "the interstack separation is shortest in @xmath19 direction and determined by two facts : ( i ) the size of the anions @xmath17 and ( ii ) the extension of the chalcogen orbitals .",
    "the ( tmttf)@xmath16 salts have weaker interstack coupling and therefore are 1d mott insulators . for the ( tmtsf)@xmath16 salts ,",
    "the interstack coupling is stronger resulting in a quasi-1d metallic state .    applying external pressure to the crystals decreases the intermolecular distances ; the consequences are twofold : ( i ) in stacking direction @xmath18 the bands widen slightly and ( ii ) the interstack hopping integral @xmath2 increases exponentially .",
    "thus , it is expected that under pressure the electronic properties of ( tmttf)@xmath16 salts approach those of their tmtsf analogs . over the years",
    "extensive experimental investigations of bechgaard - fabre salts made it possible to construct a generic temperature - pressure phase diagram @xcite containing a variety of ground states ( mott insulator , spin - peierls , luttinger liquid , superconducting etc . ) .",
    "according to their ambient - pressure properties , all bechgaard - fabre salts with centrosymmetric anions ( like asf@xmath1 , pf@xmath1 or br ) can be located at certain position in the phase diagram . the pressure offset between",
    "( tmttf)@xmath0pf@xmath1 and ( tmtsf)@xmath0pf@xmath1 , for instance , is about 3  gpa.@xcite thus , applying external pressure to the mott insulator ( tmttf)@xmath0pf@xmath1  should induce a metallic state similar to the one in ( tmtsf)@xmath0pf@xmath1 .    the first experimental evidence that relates the mott gap @xmath20 to the transverse hopping term @xmath9 at the deconfinement transition was accomplished by comparing the mott gap ( obtained by ambient - pressure infrared spectroscopy ) for various bechgaard - fabre salts with anions of different size to the interstack hopping integrals estimated from tight - binding calculations.@xcite vescoli _",
    "_ suggested that the deconfinement transition takes place around the region where @xmath21 .",
    "obviously , due to the limited number of compounds only a few points on the pressure axis can be simulated by chemical pressure .",
    "moreover , the substitution of anions affects not only the interstack coupling , but also the dimerization  and thus the band structure  along the stacks . a direct proof of the predicted deconfinement transition and a quantitative determination of the dimensional crossover is highly desired .",
    "external pressure is known to be a clean way to tune the relevant parameters of a system .",
    "hence , infrared spectroscopy under external pressure is the superior method to explore the deconfinement transition experimentally : here , the changes in the electrodynamic response along different directions can be monitored , while the interstack coupling is continuously raised .",
    "we recently applied this method to obtain a first glance on the deconfinement transition in the bechgaard - fabre salts.@xcite since this study was restricted to room temperature and the frequency range was limited , the size of the mott gap as a function of pressure could only be inferred rather than directly obtained .",
    "the one - dimensionality of the bechgaard - fabre salts has a crucial impact on their electronic properties in the deconfined state which is described by the ll model .",
    "the dimensional crossover between quasi-1d and high - dimensional ( fermi liquid ) electronic states shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram ] is very interesting regarding theoretical@xcite and experimental@xcite aspects .",
    "several power law exponents characterizing the energy and temperature dependence of the conductivity change at the dimensional crossover.@xcite the best pronounced signature is expected for the transverse resistivity in the direction of the weakest interchain coupling ( @xmath22 axis in case of the bechgaard - fabre salts ) .",
    "this transverse charge transport can be described in terms of incoherent tunneling between the conducting chains .",
    "since the density of states available for the tunneling obey qualitatively different behavior in case of luttinger and fermi liquids the transverse resistivity is expected to show a maximum at the dimensional crossover , which indeed has been observed in several experiments.@xcite high - pressure measurements allowed moser _ _ et al.__@xcite to trace the dimensional crossover temperature @xmath23 as a function of pressure @xmath24 for ( tmtsf)@xmath0pf@xmath1 .",
    "the observed @xmath25 dependence is rather strong and non - linear pointing to a renormalization due to correlation effects .",
    "the verification of the @xmath25 dependence by an alternative method would be an important step in the characterization of the electronic correlation effects in quasi-1d systems . as already pointed out by jacobsen _",
    "_ @xcite optical data provide a convenient possibility to determine the dimensionality of the electronic system , and thus to identify the dimensional crossover .",
    "thus , probing the interchain infrared response under external pressure offers a promising alternative to the dc transport measurements .",
    "in this paper we present the results of an extensive temperature - dependent infrared study of the organic salts ( tmttf)@xmath0pf@xmath1  and ( tmtsf)@xmath0pf@xmath1  under external pressure .",
    "these data combined with the pressure - dependent unit cell constants determined by x - ray diffraction measurements allowed us to directly obtain the values of the mott gap @xmath26 and the interstack hopping integral @xmath27 as a function of pressure .",
    "thus we were able to verify the relation between @xmath26 and @xmath27 at the point of the deconfinement transition in ( tmttf)@xmath0pf@xmath1 .",
    "furthermore , we estimate the line of the dimensional crossover in the temperature - pressure diagram of ( tmttf)@xmath0pf@xmath1  and ( tmtsf)@xmath0pf@xmath1 .",
    "based on the obtained results , we quantitatively suggest a unified phase diagram for the studied bechgaard - fabre salts .",

    "the mott gap was deduced for several bechgaard - fabre salts and compared to the values of the interstack hopping integrals estimated from tight - binding calculations .",
    "the results strongly support our conclusion and the theoretical predictions that @xmath21 at the deconfinement transition .      according to section  [ sec : inter - stack ] , for both compounds in the deconfined state one observed an enhancement of the drude - like response along the @xmath28 direction when pressure is applied .",
    "concomitant with the compression of the crystal lattice the orbital overlap between neighboring molecular stacks increases , and hence the drude response along the @xmath28 direction becomes stronger .",
    "on the other hand , upon lowering the temperature the scattering rate decreases , with a concomitant narrowing of the drude term .",

    "the hallmark of coherence is a drude response with a plasma frequency exceeding the damping constant.@xcite one can define a coherence parameter of the drude response @xmath81 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the plasma frequency and the scattering rate of the drude term defined in eq .",

    "( [ kappa ] ) stems from the analogy between the loss function of the drude response and the response of a simple harmonic oscillator which is considered overdamped when its eigenfrequency is smaller than twice the damping constant.@xcite    the above approach can be illustrated by the loss function @xmath85 presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : loss ] for various temperatures and pressures . in case of a drude response",
    "the loss function has a lorentzian line shape where the peak position corresponds to the plasma frequency @xmath68 and the width of the peak corresponds to the electron scattering rate @xmath69.@xcite thus , the sharpness of this so - called plasmon peak in the loss function characterizes the degree of coherence of the charge transport .",

    "the plasmon peak exhibits a small blueshift with temperature decrease .",
    "its evolution with pressure is significantly different : for a fixed temperature the plasmon peak strongly shifts to higher frequencies , while the peak width only slightly increases [ see fig .  [",

    "thus , also the pressure application results in an underdamped plasmon peak . in conclusion",
    ", there are two ways to tune the dimensionality of the system and hence induce a dimensional crossover to an hdm state - either by decreasing the temperature or by increasing the pressure .",

    "[ fig : deconf ] the interstack transfer integral @xmath27 in ( tmtsf)@xmath0pf@xmath1  increases only by about 30% when pressure increases by 4  gpa .",
    "thus , one would expect the crossover temperature of about 130  k at 4  gpa for non - interacting electrons , in contrast to the experimental observation .",
    "this provides evidence that electronic correlations play a decisive role in the renormalization of the dimensional crossover in the bechgaard salts , leading to the very fast suppression of the 1d state in favor of a high - dimensional metallic state .",

    "in contrast to the almost linear crossover line based on the dc transport results , our infrared spectroscopic measurements yield a sublinear behavior with a tendency of saturation towards higher pressures ( see fig .",

    "this sublinear behavior could be a consequence of the non - linear pressure dependence of @xmath27 which shows the tendency for saturation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : deconf ] and discussion in section  [ deconfinement ] ) together with renormalization effects due to electronic interactions .",
    "however , we can not completely rule out a certain effect of the non - perfect hydrostaticity in our measurements due to the solid pressure - transmitting medium , especially at high pressures ; this may contribute to the observed increase in the scattering rate of the drude response , which lowers the coherence parameter and shifts the dimensional crossover line down to lower temperatures .",

    "this critical pressure is basically temperature independent and it is characterized by the rapid onset of the interstack electronic transport ( along the @xmath28 direction ) .",
