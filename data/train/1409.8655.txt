    "the nuclear spins of the pair may ` flip - flop ' and the resulting magnetic noise provides a well - known source of decoherence for both electronic and nuclear qubits .",
    "however , in the case of strong hyperfine coupling between the nuclear impurity pair and the electron spin , the resulting energy detuning on each partner of the pair overwhelms the dipolar coupling , suppressing spin flip - flopping and the associated decoherence within a so - called `` frozen core '' region .",

    "this leads to clear differences between decoherence of the electronic and proximate qubits , even if in both cases the same nuclear bath is responsible for the decoherence .",
    "the differences are summarised in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] and motivate a more careful look at what is meant by the frozen core and where , precisely , its boundaries lie .",
    "for example , for the electronic qubits , decoherence is in fact dominated @xcite by impurities which lie within the usual definition of the frozen core , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , since the detuning fully contributes to entanglement .    in the present study",
    ", we consider two decoherence models for the proximate nuclear qubits , either of which , given certain assumptions , might contribute .",
    "both arise from pair flip - flops of the nuclear impurities , but under quite extreme conditions , not encountered in typical qubit decoherence studies .    _",
    "( 1 ) far bath model .",
    "_ in this model , we consider the decoherence from distant nuclear spin pairs , which are outside the frozen core and thus can flip - flop appreciably .",
    "we show that the typical contribution is so weak that we must include of order @xmath24 flip - flopping pairs outside the frozen core , at distances @xmath29     from the donor site , in order to obtain results converged with respect to bath size .",
    "in contrast , typical quantum - bath calculations of electronic decoherence require @xmath30 pairs to obtain convergence .    _ ( 2 ) equivalent pairs model . _ in this model ,",
    "the dephasing noise arises from a few dozen nuclear spin pairs , well within the frozen core , for which : ( i ) the members of the pair are symmetrically sited relative to the central spin and thus have equivalent values of the hyperfine detuning ( ii ) at least one member is sufficiently close to the nuclear qubit to have a significant dipolar interaction , while the other can be remote .",
    "they interact via a long - ranged hyperfine interaction mediated by the electron .",
    "the indirect flip - flopping of these equivalent pairs ( eps ) is found to be most significant , but we include also the rarer contribution of direct flip - flops between the nuclear central spin and any equivalent partner it might have .",
    "we obtain @xmath3 values in the seconds timescale both for individual realisations ( relevant to single donor experiments ) and also for ensemble averages over many realisations . though not previously considered , this source of dephasing is quite generic : equivalent sites may play a role in any solid state qubit system with a sufficiently dense surrounding nuclear bath .",
    "quantum - bath decoherence calculations do not include all combinatorially allowed spin clusters : there are in principle @xmath31 @xmath6si spin pairs within @xmath32   .",
    "fortunately , only a smaller fraction are physically significant .",
    "these are found by numerical search of each randomly populated lattice realization by restricting the selection to , for instance , pairs within a certain distance and coupling strength .",
    "however , applying normal distance / coupling strength thresholds turned out to be unreliable in the frozen core , so a different strategy had to be adopted to ensure convergence , given the importance of carefully locating the few dozen or so most important eps which can be quite widely separated .",
    "there is a drastic difference between the choice of spin clusters which must be included in the quantum bath for each case ( a few dozen for the ep model , @xmath28 for the far bath model ) ; surprisingly , although the decay curves have a different shape , the @xmath3 values are comparable .",
    "if electronic symmetries are important , then a strategy for breaking such symmetries , with external fields might be considered to obtain an even longer @xmath3 ; if the far bath is dominant , partial isotopic enrichment might be more useful ( consideration of @xmath6si nuclear spin registers in the present study naturally precludes full enrichment ) .",
    "either way , the combined effect is still a @xmath33  s even without any other strategy for ameliorating decoherence , such as dynamical decoupling control .",
    "we note that below 5  k , the electronic relaxation time @xmath34 is also above 1  s and would not limit the nuclear spin coherence .    in section",
    "ii , we review briefly quantum bath decoherence , for either nuclear or electron qubits . in section iii.a .",
    ", we investigate the far bath model and in section iii.b we present the ep model .",
    "finally , we compare @xmath3 values for both models and conclude in section iv .",
    "the decoherence of the central electronic spin qubit is extremely well - studied.@xcite a dephasing process arising from noise due to flip - flopping nuclear spin pairs is responsible as illustrated in fig .  1 .",
    "this basic pair flip - flop mechanism also underlies the decoherence of the proximate nuclear spins which are the subject of the present study .",
    "thus it is useful to review briefly the pair decoherence mechanism within the quantum bath approach , for both cases .",
    "the decoherence numerics here employ the cce ( cluster correlation expansion ) method for solving for quantum bath decoherence,@xcite which in general can combine clusters of all sizes , not just pairs .",
    "echo decays of donor electronic spins , in weak electron - nuclear mixing regimes , can be well simulated with just the pair correlation.@xcite where the central and bath spins are the same species , higher correlations arising from larger clusters may be required for high accuracy,@xcite but in both our models would represent only a minor quantitative correction .",
    "it is only in certain regimes of donors with strong mixing of the central - spin states , @xcite that a truly qualitative effect on the coherence times , arising from larger clusters , is evident .    for either electronic @xmath35 or nuclear @xmath36 spin decoherence ,",
    "dephasing arises from entanglement with a quantum bath .",

    "presently , it is not possible to fully include anisotropy using the kl wavefunction ; typically , the dipolar correction within this framework is included with a heaviside function,@xcite and is thus neglected for @xmath161 .",

    "the ep results are averaged over many realizations ( the far bath model coherence decays are fully insensitive to ensemble averaging ) . in the ep model , decoherence is primarily due to an indirect flip - flop process and this arises from several dozen such eps .",

    "our quantitative results are indicative : a more refined investigation should consider improved wavefunctions , more accurate than the kl wavefunction.@xcite experimental investigation of the behaviour including dependence on symmetry - breaking mechanisms ( such as crystal orientation and strain ) will be useful to test this proposal .",

    "<S> hybrid qubit systems combining electronic spins with nearby ( `` proximate '' ) nuclear spin registers offer a promising avenue towards quantum information processing , with even multi - spin error correction protocols recently demonstrated in diamond . </S>",
    "<S> however , for the important platform offered by spins of donor atoms in cryogenically - cooled silicon , decoherence mechanisms of @xmath0si proximate nuclear spins are not yet well understood . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is partly because proximate spins lie within a so - called `` frozen core '' region where the donor electronic hyperfine interaction strongly suppresses nuclear dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the decoherence of a central proximate nuclear qubit arising from quantum spin baths outside , as well as inside , the frozen core around the donor electron . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the effect of a very large nuclear spin bath comprising many ( @xmath1 ) weakly contributing pairs outside the frozen core . </S>",
    "<S> we also propose that there may be an important contribution from a few ( of order @xmath2 ) symmetrically sited nuclear spin pairs ( `` equivalent pairs '' ) , which were not previously considered as their effect is negligible outside the frozen core . </S>",
    "<S> if equivalent pairs represent a measurable source of decoherence , nuclear coherence decays could provide sensitive probes of the symmetries of electronic wavefunctions . for the phosphorus donor system </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain @xmath3 values of order 1 second for both the `` far bath '' and `` equivalent pair '' models , confirming the suitability of proximate nuclei in silicon as very long - lived spin qubits . </S>"
