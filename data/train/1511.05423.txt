    "the puzzle of the origin of high velocity clouds ( hvcs ) is still with us more than 50 years after their initial discovery ( @xcite ) , and despite the enormous progress made in the past decades in understanding their distances , size , mass , metalicity , covering fraction , and ionization state ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "hvcs are now known to exist around nearby galaxies in a population that exends at least 50 kpc from the host system ( @xcite . ) the possibility that _ some _ hvcs may be intra - group or even intergalactic , or associated with dark matter halos , or tracers of faint dwarf galaxies , can not be excluded ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "except for the magellanic stream , the origin of even the most well - studied hvc is completely unknown .",
    "perhaps the most exceptional hvc is the smith cloud ( @xcite ) , first identified in observations at @xmath1 resolution where it shows some head - tail structure , as do about 10% of milky way hvcs ( @xcite ) .",
    "observations with the 100 meter green bank telescope ( gbt ) at @xmath2 resolution reveal a spectacular cometary cloud , showing extensive evidence of interaction between the cloud and the gaseous halo of the milky way ( @xcite ) .",
    "figure 1 shows an hi image from new unpublished gbt observations ( lockman et al .",
    "the new data reveal some previously unknown cloud components symetrically placed aside the main body of the cloud , as well as a very extended `` tail '' .",
    "much is now known about the smith cloud .",
    "its distance has been estimated from three independent techniques , which agree quite well ( @xcite ) .",
    "measurement of interstellar absorption lines against stars at varying distance provide the strongest constraint ( @xcite ) .",
    "basic properties of the cloud are listed in table 1 .",
    "faint h@xmath3 emission detected from the cloud suggests that it contains as much ionized as neutral gas ( @xcite ) . from a study of the rotation measure of background",
    "agn @xcite deduce the presence of a magnetic field with an amplitude 8 @xmath4 g in the decelerated parts of the cloud .",
    "new data , currently being analyzed , should improve both of these estimates .",
    "there is no obvious stellar counterpart to the cloud .",
    "@xcite looked for young stars but did not find a statistically significant excess toward the cloud compared to adjacent areas .",
    "contamination by the milky way at the low latitude of the cloud makes this work difficult , however , and stark et al .",

    "evidence of interaction with the milky way abounds .",
    "the overall morphology of the smith cloud suggests that it is moving towards the galactic plane and enountering the galactic halo , shedding pieces of itself as it goes .",
    "the tip of the cloud at @xmath7 kpc is closer to the galactic plane than the top of some hi superbubbles ( @xcite ) .",
    "the densest portions of the cloud lie closest to the galactic plane while the `` tail '' , @xmath8 further from the plane , is much more diffuse .",
    "there is kinematic evidence of the interaction as well .",
    "figure 2 shows a velocity - position cut across the center of the cloud .",
    "the main body of the cloud is distinct from galactic hi , but there are kinematic `` bridges '' between the cloud edges and lower - velocity disk / halo gas . here",
    "we see direct evidence that portions of the cloud have been decelerated and are now blending with the galaxy .",
    "there is also a ridge of decelerated gas conforming to the upper edge of the cloud ( see figure 4 of lockman et al .",
    "( 2008 ) ) .",
    "several holes in the main body of the cloud at @xmath9 km s@xmath10 correspond to @xmath11 hi clumps at @xmath12 km s@xmath10 lower @xmath13 , suggesting that pieces of the cloud have broken away and been decelerated by the medium it is encountering .",
    "there seems to be no doubt that the smith cloud is being destroyed by its interaction with the milky way and is losing gas to the galaxy .",
    "a similar pattern of accretion is observed in the hvc complex h ( @xcite ) .",
    "km s@xmath10 , but its edges show kinematic `` bridges '' to the lower - velocity galactic gas , indicating that portions of the cloud are decelerating and being accreted by the galaxy . ,",
    "@xcite used the change of @xmath13 along the cloud s major axis to estimate a trajectory and found that the cloud has a total space velocity @xmath14 km s@xmath10 , well below the escape velocity of the milky way . while this analysis was based on early data and",
    "does not include the full extent of the cloud in fig .  1 , there seems little doubt that the cloud s largest velocity component is in the direction of galactic rotation  as it interacts with the milky way it therefore adds angular momentum to the disk .    it",
    "it likely that the main body of the cloud was never more than 4 kpc from the galactic plane and its `` tail '' is considerably closer to us than its head , though its exact orientation with respect to the plane of the sky is unknown .",
    "there is even evidence for a extended component of the cloud ahead of the main body ( @xcite ) .",
    "clarifying these points is clearly important to understanding the origin and fate of the cloud .",
    "simulations suggest that clouds falling into the milky way halo are easily disrupted ( @xcite and references therein ) , so given its striking appearance , evidence for interaction , and rather modest total space velocity , a natural question is why the smith cloud has survived as long as it has .",
    "one answer , first proposed by @xcite and presented in more detail by @xcite is that the smith cloud is the baryonic component of a dark matter sub - halo .",
    "a dark matter halo @xmath15 m@xmath6 is sufficient to stabilize the cloud core while not massive enough to induce significant star formation , which is not observed .",
    "this model may be entirely consistent with the smith cloud being a dwarf galaxy similar to leo p , but a dwarf whose accretion and disruption by the milky way are now being witnessed at close range .",
