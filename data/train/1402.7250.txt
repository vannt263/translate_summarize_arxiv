    "nonlinear optical cavities , that is , cavities containing some element whose response to an applied optical field is nonlinear , are very important both in classical and quantum optics . in the classical domain",
    "they allow for effects such as frequency conversion @xcite or spatio - temporal pattern formation @xcite , while in the quantum domain they allow for the generation of quantum correlations manifesting as squeezing or entanglement @xcite , basic resources for modern applications such as high - precission measurements @xcite and quantum information communication and processing @xcite .",
    "the paradigmatic example of such systems are degenerate optical parametric oscillators ( dopos ) ; these consist in a resonator containing a crystal with second - order nonlinearity , which , when pumped with an external monochromatic laser , is able to generate photons at the subharmonic frequency through the process known as parametric down - conversion ( pdc ) .",
    "the interplay between the nonlinear parametric amplification and the cavity losses sets a threshold power below which no subharmonic field is generated at the classical level , and it is close to this critical point where quantum effects are the largest ; in particular , more than 90% of quadrature squeezing has been experimentally generated with such a system @xcite .    in order to analyze the quantum properties of these systems ,",
    "the simplest and most widely used technique consists in expanding the field as a classical part plus some quantum fluctuations , and linearize the dynamical equations with respect to the latter @xcite ; from another ( equivalent ) point of view , this approximation means that the state is taken to be gaussian , with a mean coinciding with the classical field amplitude , and a covariance matrix accounting for the quantum fluctuations .",
    "the problem with such approximation is that it gives unphysical predictions such as perfect quadrature squeezing ( which requires infinite energy ) close to the critical points of the classical theory @xcite .    especially for dopos",
    ", people have developed more refined techniques which go beyond the linear approximation , correcting this unphysical predictions for quantum correlations . among these techniques , the ones based on the positive @xmath0 representation",
    "@xcite are of especial relevance ; this representation allows for an exact mapping of the quantum dynamics onto a set of classical stochastic equations from which a proper perturbation expansion or numerical simulation can be carried even at the critical point @xcite .",
    "moreover , in the limit in which the pump dynamics can be adiabatically eliminated , exact solutions to the steady - state positive @xmath0 distribution of the dopo are known @xcite .",
    "the dopo dynamics close to the critical point has even been analyzed via non - equilibrium many - body techniques such as the keldysh formalism @xcite .",
    "the problem with all these beyond - linear techniques is that they are quite complicated when it comes to the evaluation of two - time correlation functions needed for predictions concerning measurements outside the cavity , functions which , on the other hand , are straightforwardly evaluated within a linearized or gaussian description .",
    "motivated especially by this last fact , in this work we offer a linear theory ( or , equivalently , a gaussian ansatz for the state of the system ) which regularizes the unphysical predictions offered by the usual linearization procedure .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we describe the quantum model for dopos in the schrdinger and heisenberg pictures , using , respectively , the cavity modes master equation and a set of quantum langevin equations .",
    "then , in section [ heisenberg ] we introduce our regularized self - consistent linearization procedure in the heisenberg picture , to show in section [ schrodinger ] that it is completely equivalent to using a general gaussian ansatz for the state in the schrdinger picture . in section [ quantumresults ]",
    "we compare the quantum correlations ( quadrature fluctuations ) obtained through this method with previous exact ( or quasi - exact ) methods , showing that , despite its simplicity , it agrees with the latter not only qualitatively , but also quite well quantitatively . in the last section",
    "we conclude and comment on other systems where the method could be applied .",
    "we consider a cavity containing a @xmath1-crystal , pumped with a laser resonant with a cavity mode at frequency @xmath2 ( _ pump _ mode ) , such that photons can be down - converted inside the crystal to the subharmonic resonance @xmath3 ( _ signal _ mode ) . denoting by @xmath4 and @xmath5 the annihilation operators for pump and signal photons , respectively , the ( interaction picture )",
    "hamiltonian which describes such scenario is given by @xmath6 @xcite , with@xmath7 where @xmath8 is proportional to the amplitude of the injected laser ( whose phase is taken as a reference for any other , what allows taking this parameter as real ) , and @xmath9 is proportional to the nonlinear susceptibility of the crystal as well as the overlapping between the spatial modes involved in the down - conversion process .",
    "in addition to these coherent processes , we need to introduce the cavity losses ; there are two different ways in which this can be done . in the schrdinger ( interaction-)picture , in which the state of the system @xmath10 evolves",
    "while operators are fixed , such irreversible processes are accounted for by extra terms in the _ master equation _ as @xcite@xmath11   + \\sum_{j=\\mathrm{p},\\mathrm{s}}\\gamma_{j}(2\\hat{a}% _ { j}\\hat{\\rho}\\hat{a}_{j}^{\\dagger}-\\hat{a}_{j}^{\\dagger}\\hat{a}_{j}\\hat{\\rho } -\\hat{\\rho}\\hat{a}_{j}^{\\dagger}\\hat{a}_{j } ) , \\label{mastereq}%\\ ] ] where the damping rates @xmath12 are proportional to the transmissivity of the coupling mirror at the corresponding frequency .    on the other hand , in the heisenberg ( interaction-)picture",
    ", the bosonic operators evolve according to the _ quantum langevin equations _",
    "@xcite @xmath13 in which the _ input _ operators satisfy correlations@xmath14 and account for the vacuum driving fields entering the cavity through the partially transmitting mirror .    in the following",
    "we explain our regularized linearization of this nonlinear system in both pictures , since they provide different intuitive ideas of what the procedure means .",
    "before explaining the procedure , let us define the following dimensionless parameters@xmath15 and normalized variables@xmath16 in terms of which the quantum langevin equations are rewritten as @xmath17 note that the normalized input operators satisfy the correlations ( [ incorr ] ) but now with respect to the new dimensionless time @xmath18 .    in order to linearize these equations ,",
    "we expand the annihilation operators as @xmath19 , with @xmath20 some amplitudes which one identifies with the _ mean - field _ part of the modes @xmath21 , and @xmath22 the operators accounting for _ quantum fluctuations _ around such mean - field , with respect to which the theory will be linearized .",
    "the mean - field amplitudes can be evaluated by taking the quantum expectation value of the quantum langevin equations , leading to @xmath23 in the usual approach , these mean - field equations are solved by assuming that the state is coherent in all modes , hence neglecting the @xmath24 and @xmath25  terms , what gives rise to the classical equations that would have been obtained from maxwell s equations ; in other words , the mean - field amplitudes @xmath20 are taken to be the classical solutions of the system @xcite . in particular , in the case of equations , this coherent mean - field ansatz provides two different types of steady - state solutions depending on the injection parameter @xmath26 ( see the thin - solid light - grey curve of figure [ fig1ab ] ) : one known as the _ below - threshold solution _ with @xmath27 which is the only stable solution for @xmath28 , and another ( bistable ) solution for @xmath29 known as the _ above - threshold solution _ with the signal field switched on @xmath30 .",
    "the injection @xmath31 marks a _",
    "critical point _ where the below - threshold solution changes from stable to unstable , and , as we argue below , this sudden change in the stability conditions is what generates unphysical predictions in the linear theory @xcite .    in order to correct such a problem",
    ", we propose to incorporate some information of the quantum dynamics in the quantum - fluctuations - dependent mean - field equations ( [ mfeqs ] ) , with the purpose of obtaining a better ansatz for the mean - field amplitudes . concretely , using ( [ mfeqs ] ) ,",
    "the quantum langevin equations are rewritten in terms of the fluctuations @xmath22 as@xmath32 we can proceed then as in the regular linearization by neglecting the nonlinear fluctuations @xmath33 and @xmath34 , obtaining the linear system@xmath35 with @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and where the so - called _ linear stability matrix _ is defined as@xmath38{cccc}% -\\kappa & 0 & -\\kappa\\beta_{\\mathrm{s } } & 0\\\\ 0 & -\\kappa & 0 & -\\kappa\\beta_{\\mathrm{s}}^{\\ast}\\\\ \\beta_{\\mathrm{s}}^{\\ast } & 0 & -1 & \\beta_{\\mathrm{p}}\\\\ 0 & \\beta_{\\mathrm{s } } & \\beta_{\\mathrm{p}}^{\\ast } & -1 \\end{array } \\right )   ; \\label{l}%\\ ] ] the difference now is that , instead of substituting the classical solutions which give rise to a singular stability matrix at threshold ( what can be traced as the source of all the unphysical predictions ( it changes from negative to positive , corresponding to the destabilization of the below - threshold solution when crossing the threshold ) ; on the other hand , it is clear that within this linear description , the correlators of quantum fluctuations are inversely proportional to combinations of these eigenvalues , and hence some might diverge at threshold , what we will show later explicitly . ] ) , the mean - field amplitudes @xmath20 are left as unknown variables which are found self - consistently by calculating the @xmath39 and @xmath40  terms from this linear system , and plugging them into the mean - field equations ( [ mfeqs ] ) . in this case , it is simple but lengthy , for example by finding the ( bi - orthonormal ) eigensystem of ( [ l ] ) , to obtain the following steady - state expressions for these correlators @xmath41   } { 2\\left [   i_{\\mathrm{p}% } -(1+\\kappa)^{2}\\right ]   \\left [   i_{\\mathrm{p}}-(1+i_{\\mathrm{s}})^{2}\\right ] } , \\label{ss - moments } \\\\ \\lim_{\\tau\\rightarrow\\infty}\\langle\\delta\\hat{b}_{\\mathrm{p}}\\delta\\hat { b}_{\\mathrm{s}}^{\\dagger}\\rangle &   = -\\frac{g^{2}\\kappa\\beta_{\\mathrm{s}% } i_{\\mathrm{p}}(2+\\kappa+i_{\\mathrm{s}})}{2\\left [   i_{\\mathrm{p}}% -(1+\\kappa)^{2}\\right ]   \\left [   i_{\\mathrm{p}}-(1+i_{\\mathrm{s}})^{2}\\right ] } , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have introduced what we call the mean - field _ intensities _ @xmath42 , complemented with the _ phases _ @xmath43 defined from @xmath44 . introducing these expressions into the mean - field equations ( [ mfeqs ] ) in the stationary limit ( @xmath45 )",

    "we have chosen @xmath47 and @xmath48 , but similar figures are found for any other choice of these parameters .",
    "the thin - solid light - grey curve corresponds to the usual linearized description , while the solid blue line and dashed - dotted red line correspond to our self - consistent method below and above threshold , respectively . in ( a )",

    "it is then straightforward to show that the pump phase @xmath49 is locked to @xmath50 , while the signal phase @xmath51 can take the values @xmath50 or @xmath52 , just as in the classical solution . as for the intensities , equation ( [ mfss ] )",

    "finally , equation ( [ mfps ] ) gives an equation for the pump intensity , which can be written as@xmath57   \\left [   \\bar{i}_{\\mathrm{p}}-(1+\\bar{i}_{\\mathrm{s}})^{2}\\right ] } \\right\\ }   ; \\label{ipsceq}%\\ ] ] below threshold ( @xmath54 ) , this gives a third order polynomial in @xmath58 whose roots can be found analytically ( although not much insight is gained from their complicated expression , so we do nt give them explicitly ) , but above threshold it gives a high - order polynomial whose roots we ve only been able to find numerically . of the many solutions for @xmath59 obtained from this equation ,",
    "most of them are disregarded because they are either negative or complex , make @xmath60 in ( [ isabove ] ) negative or complex , or lead to negative photon numbers @xmath61 or quadrature fluctuations incompatible with the heisenberg uncertainty principle @xmath62 ( see below for a definition of the quadrature fluctuations ) .",
    "it is quite remarkable that , after discarding all these unphysical solutions , only two solutions for @xmath59 remain : one of the three roots of the below - threshold polynomial([ipsceq ] ) with @xmath54 , and another one from the above threshold one([ipsceq ] ) with @xmath63 given by ( [ isabove]).    in fig . [ fig1ab ]",
    "we plot the pump ( a ) and signal ( b ) intensities associated to these solutions as a function of the injection ; it is apparent that they tend to the classical solutions far away from the critical point , but never reach , in particular , the value of the intensities that makes the linear stability matrix become singular @xmath64 .",
    "hence , the solutions of our _ self - consistent linearization _ can be seen as regularized versions of the classical below- and above - threshold solutions , which remove the divergences of the linear theory of quantum fluctuations ( see section [ quantumresults ] for  and explicit discussion of the regularized quantum properties ) .",
    "the figures also allow us to see the way in which this regularization occurs : in the case of the below - threshold solution ( solid blue curves ) , the pump intensity does not grow quadratically with the injection as happens with the classical solution ( thin - solid light - grey curve ) , staying below its critical value @xmath65 for any physical value of the injection @xmath26 ; as for the above - threshold solution ( dashed - dotted red curve ) , instead of connecting continuously with the below - threshold solution as the classical solution does , its appearance is delayed a little bit respect to the classical threshold @xmath31 , and starts with a nonzero signal intensity @xmath53 .",
    "it might seem strange that the above- and below - threshold solutions do not connect continuously , but in section [ quantumresults ] we will argue why the presence or not of this ` jump ' is quite irrelevant indeed , as can be intuitively understood from the point of view of the symmetry breaking that occurs above threshold : too close to threshold quantum tunneling between the solutions with opposite signal phase is too fast , and it makes no sense to talk about these solutions independently .    in summary , in this section we have provided a self - consistent linearized theory for the dopo in which the mean - field amplitudes are found not from the classical nonlinear equations of motion , but from ones including quantum corrections ; this method provides regularized versions of the solutions that would be obtained from the bare classical theory , which avoid in particular the critical values of the mean - field amplitudes at which the linear stability matrix becomes singular , thus avoiding the unphysical results related to it .",
    "let us remark that this self - consistent method that we have put forward was already introduced in @xcite for the dopo problem , but only below threshold ; moreover , in the next section we give full meaning to the method by showing that , within the schrdinger picture , it is equivalent to making a general gaussian - state ansatz consistent with the master equation .",
    "the self - consistent linearization introduced in the previous section admits a simple interpretation from the point of view of the state of the system : we argue in the following that it is equivalent to making a general gaussian ansatz for it . in order to show this ,",
    "our starting point is the master equation ( [ mastereq ] ) , which in terms of the normalized parameters ( [ normpars ] ) and variables ( [ normvars ] ) can be rewritten as@xmath66 + \\sum_{j=\\mathrm{p},\\mathrm{s}}(2\\hat{b}_{j}\\hat{\\rho}\\hat{b}_{j}^{\\dagger } -\\hat{b}_{j}^{\\dagger}\\hat{b}_{j}\\hat{\\rho}-\\hat{\\rho}\\hat{b}_{j}^{\\dagger } \\hat{b}_{j}),\\ ] ] where we have defined an anti - hermitian operator @xmath67 .",

    "on the other hand , the evolution equations of these second moments depend on third - order moments , and here is where the gaussian - state approximation enters into play : we assume that the state of the system is gaussian @xcite at all times , meaning that higher order moments can be written as products of first and second moments only .",
    "in particular , this has the consequence that third order moments of quantum fluctuations vanish , that is , @xmath74 , where @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 can be either dagger or nothing . under this assumption ,",

    "note also that the above - threshold gaussian ansatz @xmath148 appears at @xmath106 in this @xmath99 limit , and it quite rapidly converges to the exact @xmath146 as we increase @xmath26 .",
    "in summary , we have developed a linearization procedure for nonlinear optical cavities in which the mean - field amplitudes are found self - consistently by introducing some information about the quantum fluctuations in their evolution equations ; we have applied it to one of the simplest nonlinear resonators , the dopo , showing how the method is capable of regularizing the divergences found at the critical point with the traditional linearized analysis .",
    "we have also shown that such procedure is completely equivalent to using a general gaussian ansatz for the state of the system .",
    "finally , we have compared the results derived from the self - consistent linearization with other known exact ( positive @xmath0 distribution under adiabatic elimination of the pump @xcite ) or quasi - exact ( drummond and collaborators perturbative expansion @xcite ) methods for the dopo , proving that they are reliable qualitatively , and also roughly quantitatively , with the advantage that two - time correlators ( and hence output spectra of observables ) are straightforwardly evaluated within the linearized description , what we think will be useful to study quantum correlations in more complicated systems such as non - degenerate or multi - mode opos @xcite .",
    "the application of the method to systems with other types of critical points and bifurcations is an open question that will be interesting to analyze in the future as well ; the bistability found in kerr resonators @xcite or the hopf bifurcations found in optomechanical cavities @xcite and intracavity second - harmonic generation @xcite , are good candidate scenarios .    the authors thank peter d. drummond , germn j. de valcrcel , and gza giedke for fruitful discussions .",

    "<S> nonlinear optical cavities are crucial both in classical and quantum optics ; in particular , nowadays optical parametric oscillators are one of the most versatile and tunable sources of coherent light , as well as the sources of the highest quality quantum - correlated light in the continuous variable regime . being nonlinear systems , they can be driven through critical points in which a solution ceases to exist in favour of a new one , and it is close to these points where quantum correlations are the strongest . the simplest description of such systems consists in writing the quantum fields as the classical part plus some quantum fluctuations , linearizing then the dynamical equations with respect to the latter ; however , such an approach breaks down close to critical points , where it provides unphysical predictions such as infinite photon numbers . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> techniques going beyond the simple linear description become too complicated especially regarding the evaluation of two - time correlators , which are of major importance to compute observables outside the cavity . in this article </S>",
    "<S> we provide a regularized linear description of nonlinear cavities , that is , a linearization procedure yielding physical results , taking the degenerate optical parametric oscillator as the guiding example . </S>",
    "<S> the method , which we call self - consistent linearization , is shown to be equivalent to a general gaussian ansatz for the state of the system , and we compare its predictions with those obtained with available exact ( or quasi - exact ) methods . </S>"
