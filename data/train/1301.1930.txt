    "the scaling behavior of different thermodynamic variables close to a critical point is strongly influenced by a marginal situation . in this letter , we study how marginality influences the ground state fidelity and the ground state loschmidt echo close to a quantum critical point ( qcp ) .",
    "we study the above quantities for two - dimensional ( 2-d ) dirac hamiltonians ( dhs ) close to the qcp ( which happens to be a dirac point ( dp ) with a linear dispersion ) for which exact analytical calculations ( in all limits ) are possible .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the one - dimensional ( 1-d ) and 2-d dhs have found a wide range of applications in quantum condensed matter systems in recent years  @xcite .",
    "the low - energy physics of graphene  , and of the bulk states in 2-d topological insulators is described by a 2-d dh  @xcite , and the 1-d edge states existing in a 2-d topological insulator system are described by an effective 1-d dh  @xcite .",
    "qcps of graphene ( the gapless to gapped transition induced by a mass term ) are 2-d dps with linear dispersions .",
    "experimentally , a gap can be opened in the otherwise gapless linear band structure of graphene through several methods e.g. , by the application of an external electric field to the graphene sheet  @xcite ; this is mimicked by adding a mass term to the dh which vanishes at the gapless qcp .",
    "the experimental prospect of tuning of parameters controlling these quantum phase transitions ( qpts ) in optical  @xcite and photonic lattices  @xcite have made the study of these hamiltonains also from the viewpoint of quantum information timely and necessary .    in this letter",
    ", we study the ground state quantum fidelity of a 2-d dh and show the difference in results as compared to the 1-d case .",
    "we encounter marginality in the behavior of the ground state fidelity near the dp which shows up in a prominent way both in the scaling of the fidelity susceptibility and the scaling of the fidelity in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "although the marginal situation is indicated in the scaling of the fidelity susceptibility , it is not a priori obvious that it will influence the scaling in the thermodynamic limit as well ( we note that the fidelity susceptibility is proportional to the density of defects generated by a sudden quench across a qcp  ) .",
    "we also study the scaling behavior of the ground state loschmidt echo ( le ) close to the qcp of the 2-d dh .",
    "it shows a pronounced drop near the qcp in the 1-d case but not in the 2-d case .",
    "this occurs again due to the marginality of the 2d dh .",
    "we also discuss the behavior of the fidelity and the le for a @xmath0-dimensional dp and explain how the marginal case is different from the other situations . in short , we shall show below that in the marginal situation the behavior of the fidelity and the le is strikingly different and is dependent on an upper cut - off in momentum space . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", this marginal situation is not explored in details ; the 2-d dh which is an integrable model as well as reducible to a @xmath1 form turns out to be an ideal candidate to explore the role of marginality .",
    "moreover , it enables us to study the fidelity and the echo close to a topological qpt .",
    "the letter is organized in the following fashion . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce a tight binding hamiltonian on a honeycomb lattice and arrive at a massive 2-d dh . sec .",
    "iii is devoted to the studies of the fidelity susceptibility and the fidelity in the thermodynamic limit for the 2-d dh while in sec .",
    "iv we present the studies of the ground state le .",
    "the results obtained in secs .",
    "iii and iv are generalized in sec .",
    "v for a dp in @xmath0 dimensions .",
    "we summarize the main results of the paper and their implications in the concluding section .",
    "the 2-d dh with a mass term can be realised in condensed matter systems as the effective low - energy hamiltonian of particles hopping on a honeycomb lattice with unequal sublattice potentials : @xmath2 where @xmath3 labels the bonds of the honeycomb lattice connecting sites on sublattices @xmath4 and @xmath5 and @xmath6 s are the vectors connecting the bonds involving the nearest neighbor lattice sites ; the case @xmath7 represents the gapless graphene hamiltonian .",
    "the low energy spectrum of this hamiltonian occurs in two distinct valleys at the corners of a hexagonal brillouin zone , and is described by a @xmath8 block diagonal hamiltonian with two @xmath9 blocks  @xcite : @xmath10 after appropriately rescaling units and ignoring contributions proportional to the identity matrix , one arrives at @xmath11 the momentum @xmath12 is measured with respect to the corners of the brillouin zone .",
    "the particles in the two distinct valleys are thus independently described by massive 2-d dhs , where the parameter @xmath13 is the dirac mass .",
    "this produces two bands with dispersions @xmath14 , and displays a qcp ( dp ) at @xmath15 ( with the associated correlation length exponent @xmath16 ) where the gap between the two bands vanishes ( such as in graphene ) .",
    "this is a topological phase transition characterized by a change in the chern numbers ( or equivalently , the berry phase of modes near the critical mode @xmath17 ) of the bands as @xmath13 goes from negative to positive values via the qcp .",
    "the ground state quantum fidelity  @xcite ( @xmath18 ) , which measures the overlap between many - body ground states at slightly different values of a parameter @xmath13 of the hamiltonian , is an important tool for detecting quantum phase transitions  : one can use the expansion @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is a small change in the parameter @xmath13 and @xmath21 is the linear dimension of the @xmath0-dimensional system .",
    "one also assumes a small system size limit and @xmath22 is defined to be the fidelity susceptibility density at @xmath13 .",
    "the quantum fidelity generally displays a marked drop as @xmath13 approaches the value @xmath23 at which the hamiltonian has a qcp .",
    "likewise , @xmath24 usually scales in a universal power - law fashion away from the qcp   as @xmath25 ; near the qcp , @xmath26 .",
    "we explore the marginal case with @xmath27 , using the example of the 2-d dh with a mass term ( since @xmath16 ) , while the 1-d case has been found to satisfy the proposed scaling relation .",
    "it has been shown for a one - dimensional quantum spin model with @xmath28 that neither the fidelity nor the fidelity susceptibility is effective in detecting the critical point .",
    "on the other hand , in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath29 and small but finite @xmath30 ) , one can not use the fidelity susceptibility approach  .",
    "it has been conjectured that in this limit , @xmath31 at the qcp ; this scaling has been verified for the 1-d dh .",
    "we shall show below that the marginality shows up in the scaling of both the fidelity susceptibility and the fidelity in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "one can get an exact expression for the ground state fidelity @xmath18 using the two - level nature of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham_massive_dirac ] ) .",
    "the ground state with a given number of modes is @xmath32 where @xmath33 the fidelity is thus given by a product over all relevant modes up to a certain upper cutoff @xmath34 ( where @xmath35 is the lower length scale in the problem , usually provided by the lattice spacing ) , which plays an important role that is subsequently illustrated .",
    "the effect of finite system size @xmath21 is implemented in this continuum model by using periodic boundary conditions , providing a lower cutoff on the @xmath12 modes given by @xmath36 .",
    "we find    @xmath37    let us first consider the limit of @xmath38 , with finite @xmath21 and @xmath39 , in which the notion of the fidelity susceptibility is meaningful ; we find @xmath40 the fidelity susceptibility density then satisfies the following scaling relations : @xmath41 while the first relation is valid close to the qcp , the second one corresponds to the situation away from it .",
    "these logarithmic scaling forms clearly indicate the marginality of the situation and the dh allows us to derive the scaling form exactly . in the fidelity susceptibility limit",
    ", there is a nominal drop in the fidelity close to the qcp ( see fig .",

    "@xmath42 , with ( a ) @xmath43 ( fidelity susceptibility limit ) , ( b ) @xmath44 ( an intermediate case ) , ( c ) @xmath45 ( thermodynamic limit ) . in all these cases , there is no sharp dip at the qcp , and the fidelity starts to drop from unity when @xmath46 .",
    "( bottom panel ) the fidelity susceptibility density , as obtained from ( [ eq : fidelity_massive_dirac ] ) , for the case ( a ) above , in which it is meaningful .",

    ", the thermodynamic limit refers to the situation in which @xmath47 . using the exact expression of the fidelity obtained through ( [ eq : fidelity ] )",
    ", we find , at the qcp , @xmath48 we therefore have a marginal logarithmic correction to the expected @xmath49 scaling of the fidelity even in the thermodynamic limit .",

    "here @xmath30 ranges from @xmath59 to @xmath60 .",

    "we calculate the le for the massive 2-d dh for arbitrary @xmath13 and @xmath30 .",

    "\\label{eq : echo_massive_dirac}\\ ] ] this can be evaluated in a similar manner as done for the fidelity , by taking its logarithm and converting the product to an integral .",

    "the dip near the qcp is sharp.,width=325 ]",
    "both the ground state fidelity and the ground state le of the 2-d dh do not display a sharp dip near the qcp , as opposed to the 1-d case .",
    "instead , these quantities start dropping away from the qcp , when @xmath13 becomes comparable to @xmath39 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fidelity_massive_dirac ] ) .",
    "however , the fidelity susceptibility density still displays a noticeable peak at the qcp",
    ". we shall show below that this is a consequence of the marginality of the 2d case ; for @xmath78 , the fidelity and the le will again show similar behavior , but the fidelity susceptibility will cease to show a peak at the qcp .    both @xmath51 and @xmath79 can be written in the following form ( see ( [ eq : fidelity ] ) and ( [ eq : echo_massive_dirac ] ) ) : @xmath80 where @xmath81 , is the density of states for the massive dirac dispersion in @xmath0 dimensions , and @xmath82 , is the logarithm of the term involving the respective overlap of the states with energy @xmath83 .    for @xmath84",

    "this drop grows stronger as the number of dimensions is increased .",
    "it is to be noted that the nature of this drop is not universal ; rather it is a characteristic of the dirac spectrum .",
    "in conclusion , the 2-d dh turns out to be an ideal model to explore the subtle effects of marginality on the ground state fidelity and the le close to the qcp .",
    "the marginality is reflected in the absence of a sharp dip close to the qcp at @xmath15 .",
    "the fidelity susceptibility shows a peak right at the critical point which becomes more prominent if the cutoff @xmath39 is increased ( i.e. , the high energy modes are incorporated ) .",
    "this already shows that unlike in 1-d , the high energy modes play a dominant role in the 2-d case , and hence the results crucially depend on the cutoff @xmath39 .",
    "both the scaling of the fidelity susceptibility and the fidelity in the thermodynamic limit bear the signature of marginality : while the former shows a logarithmic scaling ( with @xmath21 and @xmath13 in the appropriate limits ) there is a logarithmic correction in the latter . to explain the results from a general perspective , we consider a dp in an arbitrary number of dimensions . analyzing the generic form of the logarithm of the fidelity ( or the le ) , and using the form of the density of states of the massive dh , we arrive at the following conclusions : for a dp in @xmath88 there is no sharp dip in the fidelity ( in all limits ) and the le close to the qcp ; the fidelity and the le instead start to drop away from the qcp ( when @xmath97 ) ; this behavior will persist for @xmath98 .",
    "this drop ( away from the critical point ) is negligibly small for @xmath99 , where one observes a sharp dip at the qcp only .",
    "the fidelity susceptibility , on the other hand , shows a peak right at the qcp ( thus enabling one to detect it ) in the marginal case ; however , this peak will be absent in dimensions higher than two .",
    "it would be interesting to probe similar effects of marginality for models with @xmath100 .",
