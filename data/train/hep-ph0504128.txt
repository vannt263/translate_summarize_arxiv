    "in the last decade the photon - proton and photon - photon reactions became a testing ground for different qcd - inspired models .",
    "the dipole model was one of the most popular and successful in this respect . in the simplest version of the model only quark - antiquark fock components of the photon are included in order to describe the total cross sections . in contrast , the more exclusive processes , like diffraction @xcite , jet @xcite or heavy quark @xcite production , require inclusion of higher fock components of the photon .",
    "the higher fock components can be of both perturbative and nonperturbative nature , and therefore are rather difficult to include in a systematic manner .    in our recent publication @xcite",
    "we have constructed a simple hybrid model which includes the resolved photon component in addition to the quark - antiquark component . with a very small number of parameters we were able to describe the hera @xmath0 total cross section data with an accuracy similar to that of very popular dipole models @xcite .",
    "the advantage of our model is that it treats the total cross section and the exclusive processes on the same footing .",
    "the notion of the resolved photon is general and applies not only to photon - proton collisions . in the present paper",
    "we shall try to generalize our hybrid model also to photon - photon collisions .",
    "our approach is similar in the spirit to the approach of ref.@xcite although the details differ considerably .",
    "first , let us recall our model for the total cross section for @xmath0 collisions . in this model",
    "the total cross section is a sum of three components , @xmath6 where : @xmath7 and @xmath8 all components of our model are illustrated graphically in fig.[fig : fig2 ] .",
    "the last component becomes important only at large @xmath9 , i.e. small w.    we take the simplest diagonal version of vdm with @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 mesons included . as discussed recently in ref.@xcite",
    "the contributions of higher vector states are expected to be damped . above the meson - nucleon resonances it is reasonable to approximate @xmath13 \\ ; , \\label{sigma_vn}\\ ] ] with a similar expression for @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "a simple regge parametrization of the experimental pion - nucleon cross section by donnachie and landshoff is used @xcite . as in ref .",
    "@xcite we take @xmath15 s calculated from the leptonic decays of vector mesons , including finite width corrections . the factor ( 1-x )",
    "is meant to extend the vdm contribution towards larger values of bjorken @xmath9 .      in the same spirit",
    ", the total cross section for @xmath2 scattering can be written as a sum of the following five terms ( see fig.[fig : fig1 ] ) : @xmath16 the direct term , not possible in the case of photon - proton scattering , is related to a new ( as compared to the previous case ) possibility of @xmath17 quark + antiquark process , and can be written formally as a sum over quark flavours @xmath18 the corresponding formulae have been known for a long time and can be found in ref.@xcite .    if both photons fluctuate into perturbative quark - antiquark pairs , the interaction is due to gluonic exchanges between quarks and antiquarks represented in fig.[fig : fig1 ] by the blob .",
    "formally this component can be written in terms of the photon perturbative `` wave functions '' and the cross section for the interaction of both dipoles @xmath19 the latter quantity is not well known .",
    "it can be easily calculated in the simplest approach of two - gluon exchange . at high energies such an approach can not be sufficient , as gluonic ladders become essential . due to large degree of complexity",
    "a phenomenological attitude seems indispensable . in paper",
    "@xcite a new phenomenological parametrization for the azimuthal - angle averaged dipole - dipole cross section has been proposed : @xmath20   \\cdot s_{thresh}(x_{ab } ) \\ ; . \\label{saturation_parametrization}\\ ] ] here @xmath21 and @xmath22 our formula for @xmath23 is different from the one used in ref.@xcite .",
    "as discussed in ref.@xcite our formula provides correct behaviour at threshold energies .    in order to take into account threshold effects for the production of @xmath24 an extra phenomenological function",
    "has been introduced @xcite @xmath25 which is set to zero if @xmath26 .",
    "different prescriptions for @xmath27 have been considered in ref.@xcite , with @xmath28 being probably the best choice @xcite .",
    "following our philosophy of explicitly including the nonperturbative resolved photon , in photon - photon collisions completely new terms must be included ( the last two diagrams in fig.[fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "if one of the photons fluctuates into a quark - antiquark dipole and the second photon fluctuates into a vector meson , or vice versa , we shall call such components single resolved components . in @xmath1 scattering",
    "there are two such components : @xmath29 @xmath30 in the formulae above : @xmath31 where @xmath32 and , to a good approximation , @xmath33 with @xmath34 where @xmath35 is quark effective mass . in the present calculation",
    "we take @xmath36 for @xmath37 and @xmath38 ( anti)quarks and @xmath39 0.15 gev for @xmath40 ( anti)quarks .",
    "if each of the photons fluctuates into a vector meson the corresponding component will be called double resolved .",
    "the corresponding cross section reads formally : @xmath41 the total cross section for @xmath42-@xmath43 scattering must be modeled . in the following",
    "we shall assume regge factorization and use a simple parametrization which fits the world experimental data for hadron - hadron total cross sections @xcite .",
    "it was demonstrated recently that in the case of the total cross sections the absorption corrections violate the factorization only mariginally @xcite .",
    "assuming factorization and neglecting the off - diagonal terms due to the @xmath44-reggeon echange we obtain a simple and economical form @xmath45 with @xmath46 and @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",
    "in ref.@xcite we have adjusted the parameters of our model to @xmath0 collisions .",
    "let us try to use these parameters to describe @xmath1 total cross section . in fig.[fig",
    ": gg_tot ] we present the total cross section as a function of center - of - mass energy .",
    "the sum of all components of fig.[fig : fig1 ] ( thick - solid line ) exceeds the experimental data by a factor of two or even more .",
    "the individual components are shown explicitly as well .",
    "the direct component ( dash - dotted line ) dominates at low energies only . at high energies the dipole - dipole ( thin - solid line ) ,",
    "single - resolved ( dashed line ) and double - resolved ( dotted line ) components are of comparable size .",
    "the overestimation of the experimental data suggests a double - counting .",
    "let us try to recapitulate the assumptions and/or approximations used in obtaining the formulae of the previous section .",
    "first of all it was assumed that the coupling constants responsible for the transition of photons into vector mesons are the same as those obtained from the leptonic decays of vector mesons , i.e. the on - shell approximation was used . in our case",
    "we need the corresponding coupling constants rather at @xmath52 = 0 and not on the meson mass shell ( @xmath53 ) . in principle , there can be a weak modification by a @xmath52-dependent function .",
    "we replace @xmath54 and propose to parametrize the effect of extrapolation from meson mass shell to @xmath52 = 0 by means of the following form factor : @xmath55 the parameter @xmath56 is a new nonperturbative parameter of our new model .",
    "secondly , the `` photon - wave functions '' commonly used in the literature allow for large quark - antiquark dipoles .",
    "this is a nonperturbative region where the pqcd is not expected to work .",
    "furthermore this is a region which is probably taken into account in the resolved photon components as explicit vector mesons .",
    "therefore large - size dipoles must be removed from the photon wave functions .",
    "we propose the following modification of the `` perturbative '' photon wave function : @xmath57 which effectively suppresses large quark - antiquark dipoles .    in the following",
    "we shall try to find the parameters @xmath56 and @xmath58 by fitting our modified model formula to the experimental data .",
    "the @xmath1 data is not sufficient for this purpose as different combinations of the two parameters lead to equally good description .",
    "therefore we are forced to perform a new fit of the model parameters to both @xmath0 and @xmath1 scattering .",
    "naively one could try to adjust the new parameters in eq.([f_off ] ) and eq.([dipole_size_modification ] ) to describe the photon - photon data only .",
    "however , internal consistency would require associated modifications in @xmath0 collisions .",
    "it is obvious that such modifications would destroy the nice agreement with the hera data @xcite as obtained in ref.@xcite .",
    "it becomes clear that a new simultaneous fit of the extended model to both @xmath0 and @xmath1 is unavoidable .",
    "it is not clear _ a priori _ that a good quality fit is possible at all .    in order to quantify the quality of the simultaneous fit we propose the following simple measure of fit quality :",
    "@xmath59 this is a bit _ ad hoc _ statistically , but treats the @xmath0 and @xmath1 processes with the same weight which seems reasonable in view of large disproportions of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 data sets . in the present fit in addition to the hera @xcite data for @xmath3p scattering",
    "we include also the pluto @xcite and opal @xcite collaboration data for @xmath1 scattering .    in tables 1 , 2",
    "we have collected the values of minimal standard @xmath60 for different pairs of the newly defined parameters of the extended model : @xmath58 and @xmath56 .",
    "each value of @xmath60 is supplemented with the values of the remaining model parameters ( @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 ) which we have not presented in the table for clarity . a rather good description of both processes can be obtained .",
    "however , the smallest values of @xmath60 for both processes are situated in different parts of the two tables . in table 3",
    "we display the effective @xmath60 defined by eq.([chi2 ] ) . here",
    "the minimal value of the proposed measure @xmath64 is at @xmath58 = 5.0 gev@xmath65 and @xmath56 = 1 gev for which @xmath66 = 1.7 .",
    ".@xmath60 in @xmath67 scattering [ cols=\"^ , < , > , > , > , > \" , ]     in fig.[fig : gg_tot18 ] we show the resulting total cross section for the photon - photon scattering together with the experimental data of the pluto ( solid triangles ) and opal ( open circles ) collaborations .",
    "we also show the individual contributions of different processes from fig.[fig : fig1 ] .",
    "please note that the relative size of the contributions has changed when compared to fig.[fig : gg_tot ] .",
    "now the sum of the so - called single resolved components dominates in the broad range of center - of - mass energies .",
    "it is worth stressing in this context that these components are included here for the first time . when compared to fig.[fig : gg_tot ] the double resolved component is now much weaker and constitutes 10 - 15 % of the total cross section only . for completeness in fig.[fig : hera ] we show the analogous description of the @xmath0 data .",
    "the agreement with the hera data is similar as in our previous paper @xcite .",
    "in data processing , in particular in extrapolations to small photon virtualities one often assumes the following relation @xmath68 known as factorization .",
    "this relation is strictly true for single - pole double - resolved vdm components and means total decorrelation of @xmath69 and @xmath70 . in the following",
    "we shall consider two quantities which measure factorization breaking .",
    "the first one reads @xmath71 for the factorized ansatz ( [ factorization ] ) @xmath72 = 1 .",
    "this quantity may be difficult to measure at present as it requires knowledge of the cross section for real photons , which is not possible with present @xmath73 colliders and the detectors used .",
    "we hope this quantity can be used in the future with the help of the photon - photon option at tesla @xcite .",
    "the second quantity is @xmath74 as in the previous case it is easy to check that with the factorized ansatz ( [ factorization ] ) @xmath75 = 1 .",
    "the effect of factorization breaking is limited through the following normalization condition @xmath76 therefore it becomes clear that this quantity becomes interesting if @xmath77 or @xmath78 .",
    "the second quantity mesures formally ( de)correlations of both photons virtualities . in principle",
    ", this quantity can be used in the analysis of existing experimental data from desy , slac or lep .",
    "both quantities proposed for measuring factorization breaking require knowledge of the total cross section not only for the real photons but also for the virtual ones . before we present the quantities in question we wish to display the total photon - photon cross section as a function of both photon virtualities . in fig.[fig : cs_tot_w ] we show the corresponding maps for two quite different energies @xmath79 10 gev and @xmath79 100 gev in measurable range of photon virtualities .",
    "two observations can be made here .",
    "first , the two maps look rather similar . secondly ,",
    "fast fall - off is observed at photon virtualities 0 @xmath80 1 gev@xmath81 , with further decrease being much softer .",
    "the factorization - breaking function @xmath72 is shown in fig.[fig : fb1_w ] as a function of both photon virtualities @xmath69 and @xmath70 for w = 10 gev ( left panel ) and w = 100 gev ( right panel ) . according to the definition ( [ f_fb1 ] ) at @xmath82 or @xmath83 we have @xmath72 = 1 .",
    "the rapid variation of the function is not best represented by our rough grid . for completeness the second proposed function is shown in fig.[fig : fb2_w ] . by definition this time ( see eq.([f_fb2 ] ) ) we have @xmath75 = 1 when @xmath84 . as in the previous case",
    "fast variation occurs at small photon virtualities .",
    "having understood the general behaviour we wish to focus on the most interesting parts of the @xmath85 space . in fig.[fig : f1_q2_w ] we show the behaviour of the two - dimensional function @xmath86 along the diagonal @xmath87 and in fig.[fig : f2_q2_w ] @xmath88 along the line @xmath89 @xmath90 .",
    "the thick solid line represents our full model with all components included . for illustration",
    "we have shown also factorization breaking functions for separate mechanisms ( components in the expansion ( [ gg_expansion ] ) ) .",
    "quite a different behaviour can be observed for different mechanisms .",
    "let us concentrate first on the @xmath72 function . while the single resolved and direct component grow with @xmath52 the dipole - dipole component decreases .",
    "paradoxically , the total @xmath72 is smaller than the one for the dipole - dipole component .",
    "this surprising result is related to the nonlinearity of the quite complicated function @xmath91 which in fact involves four correlated points in the @xmath85 plane .",
    "a completely reverse behaviour can be seen for @xmath75 .",
    "this has a simple analytic explanation . substituting @xmath92 and @xmath93 into eq.([f_fb1 ] ) and @xmath82 and @xmath93 or @xmath92 and @xmath83 into eq.([f_fb2 ] )",
    "we find :    @xmath94",
    "in our former paper we have constructed a simple model for @xmath0 total cross section which , in contrast to other models in the literature , includes the resolved photon component .",
    "the latter is known to be the necessary ingredient when discussing exclusive reactions . in the present paper",
    "we have generalized the model to the case of @xmath1 scattering . in the last case",
    "a few new components appear so far not discussed in the literature .",
    "the naive generalization of our former model for @xmath0 total cross section leads to a serious overestimation of the @xmath1 total cross sections . in general , this fact can be due either to a nonoptimal set of model parameters found in our previous study or / and due to some model simplifications .",
    "for instance , it is customary that model parameters for resolved photon component obtained in the vector meson dominance approach are taken from vector meson dileptonic decays , i.e. on meson mass shell . in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 processes , of interest to us , vector mesons are rather off - shell",
    ". therefore one could expect some off - shell effects .",
    "calculating such off - shell effects in nonelementary processes is not a simple task . in this paper",
    "we have suggested to include such an effect by introducing new form factors which we call off - shell form factors for simplicity . on the other hand , when including the quark - antiquark continuum one usually takes into account the perturbative quark - antiquark `` photon wave function '' .",
    "this is justified and reasonable for small size dipoles only .",
    "the physics of large - size dipoles must involve nonperturbative effects which may lead to double counting in our model . in order to avoid double counting the large - size dipoles must be eliminated .",
    "we reduce their contribution using a simple exponential function in transverse dipole size . summarizing ,",
    "the two new functions bring in two new model parameters . having this freedom",
    "we have performed a new fit of our generalized - model parameters to the @xmath3p and @xmath1 experimental data .",
    "the generalization of the model for meson off - shell effects and large dipole size effects discussed above permits a simultaneous description of both processes considered .",
    "when trying to extrapolate the experimental cross sections for the @xmath2 scattering to real photons one often assumes factorization .",
    "our multicomponent model violates this assumption .",
    "we have quantified the effects of factorization breaking in our model with parameters fixed to describe the @xmath0 and @xmath1 data .",
    "we have proposed two functions which can be used as a measure of factorization breaking .",
    "we have found a strong effect , rather weakly dependent of the center of mass @xmath2 energy .",
    "experimental search of such effects could teach us more about reaction mechanism .",
