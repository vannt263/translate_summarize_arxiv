    "exact solutions play an important role in general relativity . examining properties of exact solutions has led to deep insights into the nature of spacetime that would have been hard to arrive at by other means .",
    "for example , much of the progress made in understanding properties of black holes in the 60 s and 70 s relied on the existence of the kerr - newman solution .",
    "the standard model of cosmology is built on friedman - robertson - walker solutions .",
    "examining properties of bianchi cosmologies has led to insight into how inflation dissipates anisotropy .",
    "much effort has been devoted to developing techniques for finding exact solutions in four dimensions @xcite .",
    "one of the earliest results in this direction was obtained by weyl @xcite , who found the general static axisymmetric solution of the vacuum einstein equations : [ eqn:4dweylmetric ] ds^2 = -e^2u dt^2 + e^-2u ( e^2 ( dr^2 + dz^2 ) + r^2 d^2 ) , where @xmath9 is an arbitrary axisymmetric solution of laplace s equation in a three - dimensional _ flat _ space with metric ds^2 = dr^2 + r^2 d^2 + dz^2 , and @xmath10 satisfies = r , = 2 r .",
    "the solution of these equations is given by a line integral .",
    "since @xmath11 is harmonic , it can be regarded as a newtonian potential produced by certain ( axisymmetric ) sources .",
    "for example , the schwarzschild solution corresponds to taking the source for @xmath11 to be a thin rod on the @xmath12-axis with mass @xmath13 per unit length .",
    "nowadays , interest in solutions of general relativity is no longer restricted to four dimensions .",
    "many interesting solutions of higher dimensional supergravity theories have been found . in spite of this , there are basic questions concerning the nature of gravity in higher dimensions that remain unanswered . in four dimensions , it can be proved that each connected component of the event horizon of an asymptotically flat spacetime satisfying the dominant energy condition has topology @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the proof relies on the gauss - bonnet theorem applied to a constant time slice through the horizon , and is therefore invalid in higher dimensions . a different approach to rule out non - spherical topologies",
    "is based on the notion of ` topological censorship ' @xcite .",
    "however , this argument is typically phrased in terms of non - contractible loops that begin and end at infinity , and which would thread through a toroidal horizon . in higher dimensions ,",
    "one can always unlink two loops by moving them apart in a fourth spatial direction .",
    "this suggests that it might be possible for the event horizon to have non - spherical topology in higher dimensions .",
    "indeed , in @xcite , it was argued that the horizon of a time - symmetric black hole in five dimensions must have topology given by a connected sum of @xmath15 and @xmath5 terms , subject to the weak energy condition .",
    "nevertheless , no example of an asymptotically flat solution with a non - spherical event horizon has ever been found has been found in @xcite .",
    "although not asymptotically flat , this solution has a spacelike infinity of topology @xmath15 , which distinguishes it from examples in which horizons of non - spherical topology are constructed by taking spacelike infinity to have non - spherical topology . ] .",
    "one aim of the present paper is to provide an example of such a spacetime .",
    "we will , for simplicity , consider only the vacuum einstein equations .",
    "a lot of work has been devoted to finding exact solutions of these equations in dimensions @xmath16 .",
    "most of this work has looked for solutions with a kaluza - klein ( kk ) interpretation , i.e. , solutions with a killing vector field along which one can perform dimensional reduction to get a sensible lower dimensional spacetime . for example , kk black hole solutions were discussed in @xcite and a kk monopole solution was presented in @xcite .",
    "kk generalizations of the c - metric @xcite and ernst metric @xcite were presented in @xcite .",
    "other axially symmetric solutions in kk theory have been discussed in @xcite .",
    "less work has been devoted to finding solutions of the @xmath1-dimensional vacuum einstein equations that do _ not _ admit a kk interpretation , either because they do not admit an appropriate killing vector field along which kk reduction can be performed , or because the reduced spacetime has pathological features .",
    "examples of such spacetimes are provided by higher dimensional versions of the schwarzschild and kerr black holes @xcite .",
    "when wick rotated , these solutions _ do _ admit kk interpretations as describing instabilities of the kk vacuum @xcite or of kk magnetic fields @xcite , but their most natural interpretation is certainly as higher dimensional black holes .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to obtain and analyze the higher dimensional analogues of weyl s class of solutions .",
    "depending on which feature of weyl s class one focuses on , there are several directions in which one can try to extend it to higher dimensions .",
    "one possibility is to seek the class of @xmath1-dimensional solutions that are static and axisymmetric , in the sense that they admit an isometry group @xmath17 ( with @xmath18 being time translations ) .",
    "however , this has been tried before @xcite without success . instead ,",
    "observe that weyl s solutions can be characterized as having two orthogonal commuting killing vector fields .",
    "hence an alternative way to generalize weyl s solutions to higher dimensions is to find all solutions of the vacuum einstein equations that admit @xmath2 orthogonal commuting killing vector fields .",
    "this is done in section [ sec : weyl ] of this paper .",
    "as in four dimensions , the higher - dimensional weyl class of solutions is parametrized in terms of axisymmetric harmonic functions in an auxiliary flat space . actually , there are _ two _ classes of weyl solutions in higher dimensions .",
    "the first , and the most interesting one , is parametrized in terms of @xmath3 harmonic functions in three - dimensional flat space , and is the natural analogue of the @xmath19 weyl solutions discussed above . the second class of solutions ( discussed in appendix [ app : special ] ) is parametrized in terms of @xmath4 harmonic functions in _",
    "two_-dimensional flat space , and therefore has no @xmath19 analogue .",
    "although weyl s construction in @xmath19 describes an infinite class of solutions , most of them are unphysical in the sense that they are not asymptotically flat , or have naked curvature singularities on the axis of symmetry results in a singular , _ non - spherical _ chazy - curzon particle . ] . the same is true for @xmath16 . in order to select candidate weyl solutions that might be of physical importance ,",
    "recall that for @xmath19 , the harmonic function @xmath11 can be regarded as a newtonian potential produced by an axisymmetric source .",
    "it turns out that the most interesting @xmath19 weyl solutions all have sources of the same form , namely thin rods on the axis of symmetry . in section [ sec : known ] , known @xmath16 weyl solutions of physical importance are analyzed .",
    "their harmonic functions also always correspond to thin rods on the axis of symmetry in the auxiliary three - dimensional flat space .",
    "a natural classification scheme for such solutions is presented in section [ sec : newsol ] . in this scheme ,",
    "the ` zeroth ' class consists simply of flat space .",
    "the first non - trivial class contains just the @xmath19 and @xmath20 schwarzschild solutions ( the @xmath21 schwarzschild solutions do not admit @xmath2 commuting killing vector fields and are therefore not weyl solutions ) , and their wick rotations .",
    "these wick rotations describe objects known as ` kk bubbles ' .",
    "if one considers the euclideanized @xmath19 schwarzschild solution , then the solution looks asymptotically like @xmath22 , the @xmath23 corresponding to euclidean time , which is periodically identified and can be regarded as a kk compactified dimension .",
    "however , the actual topology of the solution is @xmath24 .",
    "the size of the two - spheres at constant radius decreases from infinity to a minimum non - zero value at the location of the euclidean horizon , where a non - contractible @xmath14 lies . at this point",
    ", the kk circles smoothly round off and space can not be continued past this radius . by adding a flat lorentzian time direction one obtains a solution to @xmath20 kk theory where the non - contractible sphere is a static ` bubble of nothing ' .",
    "it is known to be unstable @xcite .",
    "a related solution is obtained by wick rotating both the time and one of the ignorable angular coordinates of the five - dimensional schwarzschild solution .",
    "the wick - rotated angle then becomes a boost coordinate and the solution describes a bubble exponentially expanding in the five - dimensional kk vacuum @xcite .",
    "its fully euclideanized version is an instanton mediating the decay of the kk vacuum @xmath25 .",
    "the second class of weyl solutions contains the @xmath19 c - metric as well as three new solutions .",
    "the most interesting of these is a wick rotated version of a @xmath20 metric discussed in @xcite , and can also be related to the kk c - metric of @xcite .",
    "it is a static , asymptotically flat solution with an event horizon of topology @xmath5 , i.e. , it is a _",
    "black ring_. this is the first example of an asymptotically flat solution of the vacuum einstein equations that has an event horizon of non - spherical topology . the solution is not entirely satisfactory since it has a conical singularity , but it will be shown in a separate publication that this singularity can be eliminated if the ring rotates @xcite .",
    "the two other new solutions in the same class as the black ring and the c - metric both describe superpositions of black objects with static kk bubbles .",
    "these solutions are entirely regular outside an event horizon .",
    "the first is a @xmath20 solution describing a black hole sitting in the throat of a static kk bubble .",
    "the second is a @xmath26 solution describing a loop of black string with horizon topology @xmath27 sitting in the throat of a static kk bubble .",
    "these solutions asymptote to , respectively , the kk vacua @xmath25 and @xmath28 .",
    "both are expected to be unstable .",
    "in fact , the evolution of the instability of the former solution can be obtained by a wick rotation of the black ring .",
    "if these solutions are euclideanized then they give new non - singular instantons for the decay of the @xmath29 compactified kk vacuum in @xmath20 and @xmath26 .",
    "many of the solutions we describe are naturally interpreted in terms of kk compactification along the orbits of one or several of the killing vector fields .",
    "when there is more than one killing vector field with closed orbits , one can often dimensionally reduce along different linear combinations of them . physically distinct reduced spacetimes can therefore arise from the same higher dimensional spacetime .",
    "a good example is the kk c - metric and the kk ernst solution , which are locally isometric in five dimensions @xcite . with this in mind ,",
    "different kk reductions of the new solutions found in this paper are briefly discussed in section [ sec : newkk ] .",
    "multi - black hole configurations can be readily constructed within weyl s class , and are briefly discussed in section [ sec : multibh ] .",
    "finally , section [ sec : discussion ] contains the conclusions of this work .",
    "[ sec : weyl ]      the first step in generalizing weyl s construction to more than four dimensions is to find a convenient coordinate chart for the general @xmath1-dimensional line element admitting @xmath2 commuting killing vector fields ( orthogonality of these vector fields will not be assumed yet ) .",
    "this is a simple generalization of what is done in four dimensions ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "it will be assumed that the metric is riemannian or lorentzian .",
    "let @xmath30 denote the killing vector fields , @xmath31 .",
    "since these commute , it is possible to choose coordinates @xmath32 such that @xmath33 with the metric coefficients depending only on @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the next step is to show that one can choose the coordinates @xmath34 and @xmath35 to span two - dimensional surfaces orthogonal to all of the @xmath30 . in order to do this",
    ", one has to show that the two - dimensional subspaces of the tangent space orthogonal to all of the vectors @xmath30 are integrable , i.e. , tangent to two - dimensional surfaces .",
    "sufficient conditions for integrability are supplied by the following theorem :    * theorem*. let @xmath30 , @xmath36 be commuting killing vector fields such that for each @xmath37 , ( a ) @xmath38}$ ] vanishes at at least one point of the spacetime ( not necessarily the same point for every @xmath37 ) , and ( b ) @xmath39 } = 0 $ ] . then the two planes orthogonal to the @xmath30 are integrable .",
    "the proof of this theorem is a straightforward generalization of the corresponding theorem in four dimensions , as given in @xcite . in this paper , only vacuum solutions of the einstein equations will be considered so condition ( b ) is trivially satisfied .",
    "condition ( a ) is less obvious ; in four dimensions it is usually assumed that one of the killing vector fields is an angular coordinate corresponding to rotations about an axis of symmetry , and must therefore vanish on this axis , which ensures that condition ( a ) is obeyed . the same assumption can be used to motivate condition ( a ) in the higher dimensional case .",
    "of course , this is not the only way in which condition ( a ) can be satisfied , so this theorem has wider applicability than just metrics with an axis of rotational symmetry .",
    "if the conditions of this theorem are met then the coordinates @xmath34 and @xmath35 can be chosen in one of the orthogonal surfaces and then extended along the integral curves of the killing vector fields are non - null at this point . ] . in this coordinate system , the vectors @xmath40",
    "are orthogonal to @xmath41 .",
    "if it is further assumed that the killing vector fields are orthogonal to each other then the metric must take the form ds^2 = _ i=1^d-2 _ i e^2u_i ( dx^i)^2 + g_ab dy^a dy^b , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 take the values @xmath44 , the metric coefficients are independent of @xmath45 , and @xmath46 according to whether @xmath30 is spacelike or timelike .    the final step is to use the freedom to perform coordinate transformations on @xmath47 .",
    "locally it is always possible to choose coordinates such that g_ab dy^a dy^b = e^2c dz d|z , where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are complex conjugate coordinates if the transverse space is spacelike , and independent real coordinates if it is timelike .",
