    "large - eddy simulation ( les ) of wind turbulence coupled with potential - flow simulation of ocean waves is performed for floating wind farms for the first time .",
    "the les of marine atmospheric boundary layer is performed on boundary - fitted grid that follows the wave motion .",
    "the nonlinear evolution of wavefield is simulated using a high - order spectral method .",
    "the wind and wave motions are coupled in the simulation by matching the kinematic and dynamic boundary conditions at the sea surface .",
    "large wind farm is modeled as periodic wind turbine array , with the six - degrees - of - freedom motion of floating turbines solved subject to the wind and wave loads , and the effect of turbines on wind modeled using an actuator disc method .",
    "details of the numerical methods and their validations are provided in refs .",

    "the first and second animations show respectively the perspective and top views of the simulated ocean waves . the wavefield satisfies a jonswap spectrum , with peak wavelength of @xmath0 and significant wave height of @xmath1 . in the videos , the peak wave propagates from left to right with a phase speed of @xmath2 .",
    "the third animation shows the coupled motions of wind turbulence and ocean waves .",
    "sea surface and wind speed on two vertical planes are shown .",
    "the wind speed is normalized by its mean value at @xmath3 above the sea surface , which equals to @xmath4 in this case .",
    "the last two animations show two cases of les of floating wind farms .",
    "in addition to sea surface and wind speed , turbine wakes are illustrated with vorticity .",
    "the periodic wind turbine array consists of @xmath5 turbines to represent part of a large wind farm . in the first case ,",
    "the sea surface is covered by jonswap waves with parameters given above . in the second case ,",
    "the jonswap waves are mixed with a swell with wave amplitude of @xmath6 and wavelength of @xmath7 . in the first and second cases , because the waves are respectively small and large , the turbine motions are weak and strong , respectively .",
    "analysis of the wind and wave statistics and turbine performance shows that : ( i ) for large floating wind farms , the energy extracted by the wind turbines is provided mainly by turbulence - mediated downward flux of kinetic energy from the atmosphere above , consistent with previous studies on land - based wind farms.@xmath8}$ ] ( ii ) the wind field is substantially influenced by the waves due to the effect on sea surface roughness and wave - induced form drag . as a result ,",
    "the energy extraction rate of the wind turbines is a function of wave conditions .",
    "( iii ) the motion of floating turbines also affects the turbine performance . for future development of offshore wind farms ,",
    "it is important to study the interaction among wind , waves , and turbine motions ."
