    "the vacuum structure of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) has been intensively studied over many years and a variety of interesting properties have been extracted . for example , it is well - known that the normal qcd vacuum possesses the spontaneous ( approximate ) chiral symmetry breaking ( csb ) which can be characterized by the scalar quark - antiquark condensate @xmath5 ; while the pseudoscalar condensates like @xmath6 with @xmath7 the third pauli matrix are not permitted  an assertion known as the vafa - witten theorem  @xcite .    under proper conditions ,",
    "the qcd vacuum structure can be altered , usually through phase transitions .",
    "examples include the pion superfluid phase at high isospin chemical potential  @xcite and the color superconducting phase at high baryon chemical potential  @xcite ; in the first case the isospin symmetry is broken while the chiral symmetry is restored and in the second case the color symmetry is broken while the chiral symmetry may or may not be broken .",
    "strong electromagnetic ( em ) fields provide another way to modify the qcd vacuum .",
    "strong magnetic fields may exist in compact stars  @xcite , heavy - ion collisions  @xcite , and early universe  @xcite .",
    "strong electric fields may also be accessible in heavy - ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "the presence of the magnetic field is known to enhance the scalar @xmath8 condensate at zero quark chemical potentials which is called the magnetic catalysis of the csb  @xcite , while the effect of the magnetic field on the csb at finite temperature or chemical potentials shows novel features which are still not fully understood  @xcite .",
    "it was also proposed that when @xmath9 with @xmath10 the mass of the rho meson , the qcd vacuum will become a superconductor due to charged rho condensation  @xcite .",
    "the effect of electric field on the csb was also studied  @xcite and it was found that the electric field always tends to break the scalar quark - antiquark pairs and thus weaken the csb .        in this letter , we study the combined effect of the electric and magnetic fields on qcd vacuum .",
    "we focus on the em - field configuration where the second lorentz invariant @xmath0 is nonzero .",
    "we show that the presence of @xmath1 provides a parity - odd environment in which the otherwise - forbidden ( by vafa - witten theorem ) neutral pion condensation can occur via the em triangle anomaly ( see fig .",
    "[ triangle ] ) .",
    "we calculate the @xmath2 condensate within both the chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) and the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model frameworks and identical result is obtained , @xmath11 where @xmath12 with @xmath13 and @xmath14 the scalar and neutral pion condensates in the presence of the em field , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are charges of @xmath17 and @xmath18 quarks with @xmath19 the proton charge , and @xmath20 $ ] is a critical value for @xmath21 above which the condensate @xmath22 is wholly contributed by @xmath2 mode .",
    "equation ( [ pi0cond ] ) shows that the @xmath1 rotates the chiral condensate from the @xmath23-direction to the @xmath2-direction with the rotation angle given by @xmath24 if @xmath25 and @xmath26 if @xmath27 ( see fig .",
    "[ chiralrotation ] ) .        throughout this article",
    ", we restrict to the zero quark chemical potential and zero temperature case .",
    "before we proceed , we note that the neutral pion condensation we will study is different from the disoriented chiral condensate ( dcc )  @xcite proposed to possibly occur in heavy - ion collisions , as the latter is a far - from - equilibrium , transient , phenomenon while the former is a nearly equilibrium , ( quasi-)stationary , state .",
    "we point out that , in the context of dcc , it was also found that the large em fields in heavy - ion collisions could also possibly catalyze the formation of the dcc  @xcite .",
    "the em - triangle - anomaly induced neutral pion condensation does not contradict the vafa - witten theorem .",
    "the validity of the vafa - witten theorem relies on the positivity , @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the euclidean dirac operator  @xcite .",
    "however , this is not the case in the presence of a real electric field . to see this , we write down @xmath30 explicitely , @xmath31 where @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) is the gluon field , @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) is the em field , and @xmath36 is the mass matrix .",
    "we choose the gauge such that @xmath37 and @xmath38 is time independent . for two - flavor case ,",
    "the charge matrix is @xmath39 and the mass matrix is @xmath40 .",
    "the crucial observation is that @xmath41 is _ not _ traceless and thus its role is similar with the baryon chemical potential @xmath42 .",
    "it is well - known that the presence of @xmath42 destroys the positivity of @xmath43 , and so does @xmath44 .",
    "in fact , when @xmath45 there does not exist a matrix @xmath46 such that @xmath47 to guarantee the positivity . choosing another gauge , e.g. @xmath48 , does not change the conclusion .",
    "because in this case , @xmath38 must depend on time , e.g. for constant @xmath49 , @xmath50 , which after wick rotation spoils again the positivity  @xcite . note that if @xmath51 , @xmath43 is semi - positive  @xcite .",
    "the invalidation of the vafa - witten theorem in the electric field has important physical contents .",
    "physically , in the presence of @xmath49 , the dirac determinant has to be complex or at most semi - positive because it always receives contributions from the schwinger poles which represent the particle - antiparticle pair creation due to @xmath49  @xcite .",
    "we start with the two - flavor chpt described by the lagrangian @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the usual chiral lagrangian given by ( we keep only @xmath54 terms ) @xmath55},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the wess - zumino - witten term @xmath56 is given by  @xcite @xmath57,\\\\ & & t_{\\nu}={{\\rm tr}}{\\left[}q^2(l_{\\nu}+r_{\\nu})+\\frac{1}{2}{\\left(}ququ^\\dag l_{\\nu}+qu^\\dag qur_{\\nu}{\\right)}{\\right]},{\\nonumber\\\\}&&l_{\\mu}= u{\\partial}_{\\mu}u^\\dag,{\\nonumber\\\\}&&r_{\\mu}= { \\partial}_{\\mu}u^\\dag u.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the above , the covariant derivative is given by @xmath58,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath59 is a @xmath60 unitary matrix representing the chiral fields , for which we choose the weinberg parametrization , @xmath61 where the fields @xmath62 and @xmath63 fulfill the constraint @xmath64 .",
    "now we consider constant em field and make the approximation such that we treat all the chiral fields in ( [ chirall ] ) as uniform condensates .",
    "we note that the @xmath23 and @xmath2 in eq .",
    "( [ pi0cond ] ) are proportional to @xmath62 and @xmath65 , respectively . in the absence of the em field",
    ", it is well - known that the csb takes place along the @xmath66-direction so that @xmath67 and @xmath68 . the em field with a configuration where @xmath69 is coupled to the @xmath2 field via the triangle anomaly and raises the possibility of @xmath2 condensation .",
    "if this happens , the csb will be rotated from the @xmath23-direction to @xmath2-direction . to explore this possibility",
    ", we make the following ansatz for the condensates , @xmath70 where without loss of generality , we choose @xmath71 $ ] so that @xmath72 .",
    "the lagrangian @xmath73 then becomes @xmath74 where we have omitted a total derivative term .",
    "as obviously , the second term is responsible for the triangle anomaly effects such as @xmath75 .",
    "it is easy to minimize @xmath76 and obtain @xmath77 where @xmath78 $ ] .",
    "this is equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ pi0cond ] ) .",
    "several comments are in order .",
    "( 1 ) in the chiral limit @xmath79 , thus @xmath80 , an infinitesimal @xmath1 will drive the maximum @xmath2 condensation , namely , the csb is completely driven to @xmath2-direction once @xmath1 is applied .",
    "( 2 ) the neutral pion condensation induced by @xmath1 is merely a chiral rotation ; it is not a phase transition as no symmetry is broken along this process .",
    "( 3 ) as a low - energy effective theory of qcd , the chpt is reliable only when all the physical parameters , @xmath81 , are much smaller than the typical hadronic scale @xmath82 gev .",
    "we can estimate that @xmath83 which justifies the validity of our result for @xmath1 not too larger than @xmath84 .",
    "( 4 ) as well - known , when @xmath85 ( but not larger than @xmath86 ) , the vacuum will be unstable because of the schwinger pair production of @xmath87 .",
    "we will discuss this issue in another section .",
    "the chpt is built on hadronic degrees of freedom , we now use the njl model which is based on quark degrees of freedom to test the consequences of the chpt .",
    "the lagrangian of the two - flavor njl model is given by  @xcite @xmath88,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath89 represents the two - flavor quark fields , @xmath90 is the current mass of quarks , @xmath91 is the four - fermion coupling constant , and @xmath92 is the covariant derivative .",
    "note that , in addition to the coupling constant @xmath91 , the njl model contains implicitly another parameter , the ultraviolet cutoff @xmath93 , which specifies the applicable region of the model .",
    "the values of @xmath91 and @xmath93 are determined by fitting njl predictions with the physical hadronic observables like @xmath94 and @xmath8 in the normal vacuum  @xcite .",
    "the njl model was widely used to study a number of non - perturbative properties of qcd , especially those related to the chiral symmetry .",
    "in fact , the njl model shares the same global symmetries with qcd . at the mean - field level where only the leading - order terms in the @xmath3 expansion are kept , @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the constitute mass of quarks and @xmath97 and @xmath98 represent the sigma and neutral pion condensates .",
    "the quark fields can then be integrated out analytically , which is most conveniently done in euclidean path integral and the resultant thermodynamic potential reads @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the euclidean spacetime volume , @xmath101 acts on all physical spaces , and the quark propagator is @xmath102 it is diagonal in flavor space which allows us to calculate it analytically by adopting the schwinger proper - time formalism  @xcite .",

    "the true vacuum corresponds to the global minimum of @xmath109 . in the case that @xmath110 and @xmath111 , we have numerically minimized @xmath109 and obtained the corresponding @xmath112 and @xmath2 , see fig .  [ fig_m_pi0 ] .",
    "once @xmath1 is turned on , finite @xmath2 condensate arises and sigma condensate is suppressed  a feature representing a chiral rotation from @xmath23-direction to @xmath2-direction ; when @xmath113 gev , the csb is driven by @xmath2 condensate solely .",
