    "<S> a purely geometrical relativity theory results from a construction that produces from three - dimensional space a happy unification of kaluza s five - dimensional theory and weyl s conformal theory . </S>",
    "<S> the theory can provide geometrical explanations for the following observed phenomena , among others : ( a ) lifetimes of elementary particles of lengths inversely proportional to their rest masses ; ( b )  the equality of charge magnitude among all charged particles interacting at an event ; ( c )  the propensity of electrons in atoms to be seen in discretely spaced orbits ; and ( d )  ` quantum jumps ' between those orbits . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests the possibility that the theory can provide a deterministic underpinning of quantum mechanics like that provided to thermodynamics by the molecular theory of gases .    </S>",
    "<S> this presentation is intended to show that some of the phenomena thought to be explainable only through the process of ` quantizing ' a classical relativistic theory can be explained , qualitatively and to some degree quantitatively , by a purely geometrical relativity theory based on and derived solely from the geometry of three - dimensional space . </S>",
    "<S> a simple geometric construction applied iteratively generates new dimensions beyond the basic three of space . </S>",
    "<S> the first application produces space - time , the second produces space - time  time , and so on . </S>",

    "<S> space - time  time , in which quantum effects show up , is a happy hybrid of two notable attempts at a unified theory of gravity and electromagnetism : the kaluza five - dimensional geometry @xcite and the weyl conformal geometry @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . brought together in this way those theories lose their undesirable properties while retaining their useful ones . that the space - time  time geometry both induces quantum effects and includes gravity ( along with other fields ) calls into question the rationale behind the search for a quantum theory of gravity . </S>",
    "<S> this presentation and its author might therefore be regarded as intruders from a school devoted to `` escapes from quantum gravity '' , conducted in a parallel universe .    </S>",
    "<S> the geometric construction in question can be understood initially by reference to fig .  1 , which shows in cross section two neighboring spheres @xmath0 and @xmath1 in euclidean 3-space @xmath2 with centers @xmath3 and @xmath4 the distance @xmath5 apart , and with radii @xmath6 and @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the angle @xmath8 in which they intersect is found , by application of pythagoras theorem to the infinitesimal right triangle in the middle , to be given by @xmath9 , which shows @xmath8 to be the line element of a metric of diagonal signature @xmath10 on the four - dimensional manifold @xmath11 whose points are the 2-spheres of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath8 is invariant under conformal transformations of @xmath2 .    </S>",

    "<S> 2 . here , instead of @xmath2 there is a three - dimensional manifold @xmath12 with a positive - definite riemannian metric @xmath13 , whose geodesic 2-spheres are the points of @xmath11 ; @xmath0 and @xmath1 are two such spheres , @xmath14 is the geodesic through their centers @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and the line element is generated as the product of the distances ( relative to a scaled radius @xmath15 ) by which @xmath16 and @xmath17 are displaced when @xmath0 is magnified radially by the factor @xmath18 and its center @xmath3 is shifted a distance @xmath5 along the geodesic to @xmath4 , which in effect converts @xmath0 to @xmath1 . the line element that results </S>",
    "<S> is given by @xmath19 .    </S>",
    "<S> defining a new coordinate @xmath20 by @xmath21 makes @xmath22 a generalization of the de sitter space - time metric for an empty expanding universe of uniform radius of curvature @xmath23 , to which metric it reduces when @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , by means of a simple geometric construction we have produced from ( more aptly , discovered within ) the geometry of three - dimensional space the geometry of a four - dimensional space - time .    </S>",
    "<S> the tensor product version of the metric specified by equation ( 1 ) is @xmath25 where @xmath13 is the metric of @xmath12 . for this space - time </S>",
    "<S> metric @xmath26 is a ` conformal semi - killing ' vector field , in the sense that @xmath27 , where @xmath28 denotes lie differentiation along @xmath26 . observing that @xmath29 </S>",
    "<S> , one sees that to capture least restrictively in a generic space - time metric @xmath30 on a manifold @xmath11 the essence of the geometrical construction in question it is sufficient to subject @xmath30 to the constraint that there exist on @xmath11 a time - like vector field @xmath31 such that @xmath32 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> it is then easy to see that , in a coordinate system @xmath33 adapted to @xmath31 so that @xmath34 , @xmath30 takes the form @xmath35 with @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 independent of @xmath20 .    </S>",
    "<S> having arrived at the space - time geometry described by the metric @xmath30 on the manifold @xmath11 , we can repeat the construction , applying it this time to the geodesic 3-spheres of @xmath11 to produce a metric on the five - dimensional manifold @xmath39 whose points are those geodesic 3-spheres . generalizing that metric in the manner that produced ( 3 ) we obtain @xmath40 referred to a coordinate system @xmath41 such that @xmath42 , where now @xmath13 is the space - time metric and @xmath36 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 , the counterparts of the previous @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 , are independent of @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> the factor @xmath46 enters because there are two kinds of spheres ( hyper - hyperboloids , actually ) in space - time . </S>",
    "<S> those whose points lie in spacelike directions from their centers require that @xmath47 , those whose points lie in timelike directions from their centers require @xmath48 . in either case , because the construction that produced @xmath30 from space - time is the same one that produced space - time from space , it is justified , indeed unavoidable , to label the manifold @xmath39 with the metric @xmath30 a space - time  time , and to identify @xmath45 as a temporal coordinate , albeit of a secondary nature distinct from that of the primary time coordinate @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> ultimately the @xmath49 distinction should be resolved by allowing @xmath45 to be a complex coordinate . for present purposes , </S>",
    "<S> however , @xmath45 will be kept real and @xmath46 will be 1 , the points of @xmath39 being therefore the spacelike spheres of @xmath11 .    the geometry of space - time  </S>",
    "<S> time is the previously mentioned happy hybrid of the kaluza and the weyl geometries . as in kaluza </S>",
    "<S> s theory , @xmath50 is the space - time covector potential of the electromagnetic field 2-form @xmath51 defined by @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> the coordinate transformation @xmath53 , with @xmath54 independent of @xmath45 , generates in one stroke both the electromagnetic gauge transformation @xmath55 and the weyl conformal transformation @xmath56 . </S>",

    "<S> newton force @xmath79 , the lorentz force @xmath80 , the ` weyl force ' @xmath81 , and the ` kaluza force ' @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> equation  ( 11 ) produces generic behavior of @xmath67 that is exemplified in the solution @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is secondary proper time and @xmath36 is taken to be constant . from @xmath76 follows @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> if also @xmath86 , then equation ( 12 ) tells that @xmath87 is constant , and ( 8) yields @xmath88 , which shows the particle s proper lifetime to be confined to the open interval @xmath89 ( @xmath90 ) , thus associates longer lifetimes with smaller rest masses , shorter lifetimes with larger rest masses . noting in passing the equivalence of inertial mass and passive gravitational mass implied by the two appearances of @xmath87 in the lefthand member of ( 10 ) , one divides by @xmath87 to obtain @xmath91 , which says that the particle s space - time track is a geodesic of the einstein geometry . </S>",
    "<S> the particle s coordinates @xmath92 will in general have @xmath84 dependence similar to that of @xmath93 , in consequence of which the particle s space - time track will have an endpoint event @xmath94 at which it appears suddenly , traveling with velocity @xmath95 ( if @xmath96 ) , and an endpoint event @xmath97 at which it disappears just as suddenly , traveling with velocity @xmath98 .    </S>",
    "<S> essential features of this behavior will persist in the generic case where @xmath36 and @xmath43 are not restricted . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the space - time track will end at events @xmath94 and @xmath97 , and @xmath67 will grow from @xmath99 to 0 and on to @xmath100 and @xmath45 will depart from and return to @xmath101 , as @xmath84 goes from @xmath102 to @xmath101 . </S>",

    "<S> time case , with @xmath13 describing a nongravitating , static , spherically symmetric , traversable wormhole , with @xmath111 , and with @xmath112 , numerical integration yields a variety of solutions for which , as @xmath113 , @xmath114 is asymptotic to a coulomb potential @xmath115 . for one of these , typical of a large class , @xmath116 has , for @xmath117 , the shape shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4 . </S>",
    "<S> the spacing of successive bottoms of the potential wells of @xmath116 , located at @xmath118 , @xmath119 , is asymptotic to @xmath120 , consistent with @xmath121 s growing asymptotically as @xmath122 . </S>",
    "<S> figure  5 is a graph of an artificial version @xmath123 of @xmath124 with @xmath125 and potential wells of uniform depth , to be used for illustrative purposes .    </S>",
    "<S> now comes a most remarkable aspect of a test particle s space - time behavior : both as @xmath126 and as @xmath127 the factor @xmath128 that in equation ( 10 ) couples the kaluza force to the momentum rate becomes infinite , which causes that force to _ infinitely _ dominate the other three , and to push each of the terminal events @xmath94 and @xmath97 toward a bottom of one of the potential wells of @xmath124 . </S>",
    "<S> thus a scatter plot of @xmath94 and @xmath97 generated by random choices of initial conditions @xmath129 and @xmath130 for the test particle s path @xmath65 would show high densities near those potential well bottoms , low densities elsewhere . </S>",
    "<S> figure  6 illustrates this behavior , which clearly suggests the possibility of a ( for the present , only qualitative ) deterministic underpinning of quantum mechanics like that provided to thermodynamics by the molecular theory of gases .    as illustrated in fig .  3 , neither of the events @xmath94 and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath97 is a projection of a point on the geodesic path @xmath65 : they are only limits of such projections as @xmath131 and @xmath132 . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the particle whose space - time track the projection is exists neither at or before @xmath94 nor at or after @xmath97 , rather exists only between @xmath94 and @xmath97 . </S>",
    "<S> think back , however , to the original conception of events in space - time as 2-spheres in space , with @xmath133 . under this interpretation </S>",
    "<S> the projection of @xmath65 is a one - parameter family of spheres which converges at either of these events  @xmath134 to the sphere @xmath135 centered at the spatial location of    @xmath134 and with the nonzero radius  @xmath136 . by definition @xmath137 , and therefore every test particle track that has @xmath134 as one of its endpoints would include @xmath135 by continuity . </S>",
    "<S> what is more , the full geodesic path is itself a one - parameter family of space - time  time points , thus of ( hyper - hyperboloidal ) ` spheres ' of space - time . </S>",
    "<S> the 3-`sphere ' @xmath138 that is the point at @xmath41 has as its center the spatial 2-sphere that is the event at @xmath139 in space - time . </S>",
    "<S> the radius of @xmath138 is @xmath140 , which goes to zero at @xmath134 . </S>",
    "<S> according to the space - time metric constructed in fig .  1 , @xmath138 is the set of all 2-spheres that lie an angular distance @xmath140 from the central 2-sphere . </S>",
    "<S> this set is a union of disjoint subsets each of which is a one - parameter family of 2-spheres all mutually tangent to one another at a single point of the central 2-sphere , which they all intersect in an angle of radian measure @xmath140 . </S>",
    "<S> these families , which in the conventional sense are null generators of the hyper - hyperboloid that is the 3-sphere @xmath138 , are null geodesics of space - time which broadcast the location and size of the central 2-sphere , both forward in time and backward . as @xmath132 the 2-spheres all become tangent to the central sphere . </S>",
    "<S> conventionally put , the hyperboloid @xmath138 collapses to a null cone , whose vertex is the event corresponding to ( i.e. , equal to by definition ) the limiting central sphere @xmath135 . </S>",
    "<S> the events on or interior to the past null cone of @xmath94 and the future null cone of @xmath97 receive no information about the particle , but every other event is notified of the particle s existence ( by being an event on a null generator of one of the hyperboloids @xmath138 in the space - time  time geodesic , thus by being a 2-sphere in one of the families of mutually tangent 2-spheres whose union is @xmath138 ) . if we now consider the test particle following the path @xmath65 to in fact _ be _ a 2-sphere in space , going forward in ( primary ) time by shrinking , then , because it has nonzero spatial radius at @xmath94 and @xmath97 , the particle can be deemed to exist there , even though it is visible only between @xmath94 and @xmath97 .    </S>",
    "<S> a second test particle whose track shared with that of the first an endpoint @xmath134 would have in common with the first the 2-sphere @xmath135 , thus would be , for an instant at least , the same particle . </S>",
    "<S> the two particles could be thought of as extensions of one another , as well as of all other particles that shared the endpoint @xmath134 . such an event would be an ` interaction ' event , not unlike a vertex in a quantum mechanical feynman diagram . built in to the interaction would be that all participating charged particles have the same charge magnitude @xmath141 .    </S>",
    "<S> there is much left unreported here , but i trust that what has been reported is sufficient to lend credence to the proposition that some measure of the physics of quantum phenomena can be extracted , qualitatively and to some degree quantitatively , from the geometry of three - dimensional space . </S>"
