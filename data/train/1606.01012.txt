    "the discovery of superconductivity in lafeaso@xmath4f@xmath5 with a @xmath6 = 26 k by kamihara @xmath7 @xcite unveiled a new field of research generally referred to _ fe - based  superconductors _",
    "( fe - sc ) .",
    "several new superconducting phases have been discovered with highest @xmath6 of 56  k achieved so far in bulk samples .",
    "@xcite . among the different families of fe - sc ,",
    "fese ( 11-type chalcogenide ) has the simplest crystal structure @xcite .",
    "the atomic structure belongs to the tetragonal @xmath8 space group and consists of edge - sharing fese@xmath9 tetrahedra , which form layers orthogonal to the @xmath10-axis .",
    "the bulk @xmath6 of fe@xmath1se is 8.5  k at ambient conditions , with the superconducting properties being extremely sensitive to the amount of excess fe @xcite .",
    "the @xmath6 of fese can be increased to as high as 37 k by the application of hydrostatic pressure @xcite .",
    "this makes fe@xmath1se a member of the high-@xmath6 class of compounds .",
    "fe@xmath1se does not order magnetically , but spin fluctuations were detected by nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) measurements @xcite .",
    "the spin fluctuations are found to be strongly increased near @xmath6 , and applied pressure seems to enhance the spin fluctuations along with the superconducting transition temperature @xcite . on the other hand , @xmath6 of fese",
    "can also be increased by te substitution of se , up to a maximum of @xmath11 15 k for fe@xmath0se@xmath12te@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the superconducting volume fraction decreases with increasing te and no superconductivity has been found so far in bulk samples of the end - member fe@xmath0te .",
    "it is also important to mention that a monolayer of fese on a srtio@xmath13 substrate becomes superconducting with @xmath6 in the range of 65 - 100  k @xcite .",
    "angle resolved photoemission spectroscopic ( arpes ) measurements observed its fermi surface being distinct from other iron - based superconductors , consisting only of electron - like pockets near the zone corner without indication of any hole - like fermi surface around the @xmath14 point @xcite .",
    "the high-@xmath6 in the fese monolayer likely originates from an electron doping by the substrate at the interface thereby modifying the fermi surface @xcite .",
    "although the properties of fese monolayers are extremely interesting , here we limit ourselves to bulk materials only .",
    "further , this article gives by no means a complete review of the vast existing literature on fe - chalcogenides , it only provides an overview with emphasis on the composition and homogeneity of the samples .",
    "in the literature , there has been some confusion concerning the nomenclature of the tetragonal fese . in this article , following the early publications of the binary phase diagram of fese @xcite , the tetragonal fese is referred to as @xmath15-fese .",
    "although the binary phase diagram of fe@xmath1se was known for about three decades @xcite , the interest in this compound rose tremendously when superconductivity was found in fese@xmath16 by hsu _",
    "et  al_. @xcite .",
    "these polycrystalline samples were synthesized by mixing high - purity se and fe powder and carrying out the reaction at 700@xmath17c , which is slightly above the boiling point of se ( for the detailed synthesis procedure see ref .",
    "superconductivity was reported for highly se deficient samples fese@xmath18 .",
    "the x - ray diffraction pattern of these samples displayed several impurity phases as well as unknown phases .",
    "this work was followed by a combined x - ray and neutron diffraction study which reported a composition for the superconductor as fese@xmath19 @xcite .",
    "both these compositions fall outside of the composition reported in ref .",
    "@xcite for the binary phase diagram of @xmath15-fese .",
    "alternatively , mcqueen _ et  al_. @xcite considered stoichiometric fese samples .",
    "they used two different temperature steps of 750@xmath17c and 1025@xmath17c , respectively , before cooling the sample to 420@xmath17c , followed by subsequent quenching of the sample to -13@xmath17c @xcite .",
    "this procedure yielded fese samples free of impurities .",
    "further , mcqueen _ et  al_. @xcite reported that fe@xmath20se and fe@xmath21se are superconductors with @xmath6 = 8.5  k and 5 k , respectively , whereas fe@xmath22se is not a superconductor at all .",
    "a more detailed comparison @xcite on samples synthesized by the above mentioned two different routes concluded that a stable phase exhibiting superconductivity at 8  k exists in a narrow range of selenium concentration fese@xmath23 ( @xmath24 fe@xmath25se ) .",
    "more recently , koz _",
    "et  al . _",
    "@xcite synthesized fese by following the procedure described in ref .",
    "@xcite and starting from the nominal compositions of the fe : se ratio in the range 0.98 - 1.02 .",
    "the lattice parameters obtained from the x - ray diffraction of these samples are presented in fig .",
    "1 . it can be seen in fig.1 that the stability range of fe@xmath1se narrows the nominal composition range to @xmath26 .",
    "thus , the composition of iron selenide lies in the range fe@xmath27se to fe@xmath20se , and is referred to hereafter as @xmath15-fese .",

    "labels s1 and s2 represent two different series of synthesis under the same conditions @xcite.,width=8 ]      different methods have been attempted for the growth of single crystals of fese .",
    "these methods include vapor self transport @xcite ; alkali - halide - flux growth with kcl ( or kbr ) @xcite , nacl / kcl @xcite , licl / cscl @xcite , or kcl / alcl@xmath13 @xcite ; the bridgman technique @xcite ; the traveling - solvent float zone technique @xcite ; chemical vapor transport with i@xmath28 @xcite , tecl@xmath9 @xcite , or febr@xmath13 @xcite ; a cubic - anvil high - pressure technique @xcite ; and chemical vapor transport with alcl@xmath13 @xcite .",
    "many of these techniques did not yield high - quality single crystals of fese .",
    "for instance , for single crystals growth with only alkali - halide flux @xcite as well as by the bridgman technique @xcite , impurities like @xmath29-fe@xmath30se and @xmath31-fe were reported .",

    "@xcite took powders of fe and se in an atomic ratio of 1.1:1 .",
    "the powders were put in an evacuated sio@xmath28 ampule together with an eutectic mixture of kcl and alcl@xmath13 .",
    "the ampoule was heated to 390@xmath17c on one end while the other end was kept at 240@xmath17c .",
    "after 28.5 days isometric fese crystals with tetragonal morphology were extracted at the colder end of the ampule . the level of impurities in these single crystals was found to be less than 500 ppm .",

    "the ampule was placed in a two - zone furnace at temperatures @xmath35 = 400@xmath17c and @xmath36 = 300@xmath17c .",

    "the single crystals were characterized by x - ray diffraction , wave length dispersive x - ray spectroscopy , and electron diffraction .",
    "the results of these experiments proved a high quality of the single crystals and hence , the amount of impurities present in the sample was assumed to be below the detection limit of these physical measurements .",
    "further , topography measured by scanning tunneling microscopy displayed large surfaces free of impurities and defects @xcite .",
    "in addition to these methods , magnetization measurements at room temperature were utilized to estimate the amount of elemental fe in the samples . according to these estimates",

    "the superconducting fe@xmath20se has an orthorhombic distortion , indicated by the splitting of some peaks in the synchrotron x - ray diffraction ( sxrd ) pattern , fig .",
    "the orthorhombic distortion is due to coherent twisting of the upper and lower se pairs away from the ideal angle of 90@xmath17 .",
    "it can be described by five parameters : the torsional angle between the se pairs ( @xmath61 ) , two fe - fe distances ( @xmath62 and @xmath63 ) , the fe - se bond length ( bl@xmath64 ) , and the upper se - fe - se angle ( @xmath65 ) @xcite .",
    "the temperature - dependence of these parameters is shown in fig .",
    "it is interesting to note that the structural transition is found only in the superconducting fe@xmath20se , but not in the non - superconducting fe@xmath22se @xcite .",
    "therefore , an observation of this structural transition can be considered as a good test for the composition of fese samples .",
    "the single crystals of fese grown by kcl / alcl@xmath13 flux @xcite and chemical vapor transport with alcl@xmath13 @xcite , both displayed the orthorhombic phase transition .",
    "the origin of the structural phase transition in fese nonetheless remains controversial .",
    "although @xmath15-fese does not display a long - range magnetic order , signatures of spin - fluctuations have been detected in nmr @xcite , magnetic susceptibility @xcite , and inelastic neutron scattering experiments @xcite .",

    "the highly dispersive paramagnetic fluctuations found along ( @xmath66,0 ) in the fe - square lattice extending beyond 80 mev in energy suggested that fese is close to an instability towards ( @xmath66,0 ) antiferromagnetism that is characteristic of the parent phases of the fe - pnictide superconductors @xcite .",

    "the temperature evolution of @xmath67 was compared with the orthorhombic distortion , @xmath68 , where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the lattice parameters of fese .",
    "the results indicated that the enhancement of @xmath67 is coupled to the orthorhombic phase , which is consistent with the theoretical proposals of a nematic order driven by spin fluctuations @xcite .",
    "alternatively , an orbital - driven nematic scenario was favored by the results based on nmr experiments @xcite , in which , unlike the neutron scattering , probe only momentum - integrated spin fluctuations at very low energies .",
    "the spin - lattice relaxation rate measured in those nmr experiments starts to diverge at temperatures significantly lower than the structural transition temperature of 87  k. based on this fact , bhmer _",
    "_ argued that the spin - fluctuations are not the driving force of the structural phase transition @xcite .",
    "further , baek _",
    "et  al . _",
    "observed an order - parameter - like temperature dependence of the knight shift when measured with magnetic field applied parallel to the crystallographic @xmath48 axis @xcite .",
    "since the knight shift is proportional to the orbital - order parameter , they concluded that the nematicity in fese is driven by orbital order .",
    "several arpes experiments reported a 50 mev splitting of @xmath69 and @xmath70 bands @xcite , which is considered as an evidence of nematicity . on the other hand ,",
    "the first arpes measurement on fese @xcite contradicted the above results by claiming that all observed arpes spectral features can be explained by regular band structure calculations , therefore they do not provide any evidence for nematic order .",
    "further , it was shown that even though a band splitting of 50 mev was found in the energy dispersive curves , by taking into account the intrinsic widths of these peaks , the possible remaining splitting was estimated to be in the order of 5  mev @xcite .",
    "note that this is a reasonable estimation of an energy scale of the structural phase transition occurring at 87  k.     in the temperature range 12 - 100  k.

    "<S> this article reviews recent experimental investigations on two binary fe - chalcogenides : fese and fe@xmath0te . </S>",
    "<S> the main focus is on synthesis , single crystal growth , chemical composition , as well as on the effect of excess iron on structural , magnetic , and transport properties of these materials . </S>",
    "<S> the structurally simplest fe - based superconductor fe@xmath1se with a critical temperature @xmath2 8.5  k undergoes a tetragonal to orthorhombic phase transition at a temperature @xmath3 87  k. no long - range magnetic order is observed down to the lowest measured temperature in fe@xmath1se . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> isostructural fe@xmath0te displays a complex interplay of magnetic and structural phase transitions in dependence on the tuning parameter such as excess amount of fe or pressure , but it becomes a superconductor only when te is substituted by a sufficient amount of se . </S>",
    "<S> we summarize experimental evidence for different competing interactions and discuss related open questions . </S>"
