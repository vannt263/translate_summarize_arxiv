    "low dimensional organic conductors have attracted sustained interest regarding their rich phase diagram showing almost all known ground states with particularly a superconducting phase next to a magnetic ordering @xcite , which is reminiscent of high-@xmath0 superconductors .",
    "this proximity is believed to result in a phase segregation consisting of an inhomogeneous coexistence of electronic states such as the nanoscale charge stripes observed in copper oxide @xcite .",
    "mesoscopic scale inhomogeneities have been reported in the organic charge transfer salts ( tmtsf)@xmath2x @xcite , so - called bechgaard salts , and @xmath3(bedt - ttf)@xmath2y @xcite where tmtsf denotes the donor molecule tetramethyl - tetraselenafulvalene while bedt - ttf stands for the bis(ethylenedithio)tetrathiafulvalene ; x = clo@xmath4 , pf@xmath5 , reo@xmath4 ... and y = cu(ncs)@xmath2 , cu[n(cn)@xmath2]z ( z = br and cl ) are inorganic anions .",
    "these compounds are highly anisotropic : the former show marked quasi - one dimensional ( q1d ) electronic properties whereas the latter , abbreviated as ( et)@xmath2 , can be regarded as a layered ( two - dimensional 2d ) systems .",
    "the switching between the several low temperature electronic phases of these compounds can be controlled by applying hydrostatic pressure or by chemical substitution of either the inorganic anion or the donor molecule .    a close investigation of the boundary between the magnetic phase and the superconducting one reveals a mesoscopic phase segregation where the system shows coexistence of superconducting domains separated by magnetic ones @xcite .",
    "several experimental studies have reported that the interplay between these two phases is substantially dependent on the purity of the sample .",
    "likewise , it has been found that this segregated structure can be induced by varying the hydrostatic pressure around the critical value @xmath7 at which the magnetic phase collapses @xcite .",
    "disorder turns out to be a key parameter for the stability of the superconducting state in these compounds .",
    "despite the general consensus on the unconventional nature of the superconducting phase of different organic superconductors , the symmetry of the corresponding order parameter is still under debate @xcite . studying the effect of disorder on the superconducting phase",
    "may bring an answer to the puzzling question of the superconducting symmetry . in these molecular materials ,",
    "two types of disorder can be found : ( i ) extrinsic disorder resulting from the random imperfections obtained by introducing impurities or radiation damages .",
    "( ii ) intrinsic disorder related to the noncentrosymmetric character of the inorganic anions , such as clo@xmath8 in ( tmtsf)@xmath2clo@xmath4@xcite , or to the presence of internal degrees of freedom such as partially disordered ethylene groups adopting several conformations in @xmath3(et)@xmath2x @xcite .",
    "these structural degrees of freedom , which are strongly dependent on the cooling history of the sample , have drastic effect on the superconducting state .",
    "a rapid cooling of the sample induces a strong depression of the superconducting transition temperature @xmath0 and may even destroy superconductivity as in ( tmtsf)@xmath2clo@xmath4@xcite .",
    "there have been several experimental studies dealing with the disorder in organic superconductors . in ( tmtsf)@xmath2x , studies were focused particularly on the cooling rate induced disorder in ( tmtsf)@xmath2clo@xmath4 @xcite and disorder generated by the anion substitution in ( tmtsf)@xmath2(clo@xmath4)@xmath9(reo@xmath4)@xmath10 @xcite . in @xmath3(et)@xmath2x , disorder was introduced by rapid cooling @xcite , chemical substitution of donor or anion @xcite , x - ray and proton damage @xcite .    the superconducting transition temperature t@xmath11 is found to be reduced by increasing the amount of disorder regardless of its origin @xcite . a theoretical analysis @xcite of the dependence of t@xmath11 on disorder in different ( et)@xmath2x salts has shown that the suppression of t@xmath11 obeys to the abrikozov - gorkov ( ag ) law @xcite which describes the suppression of t@xmath11 in the presence of either magnetic impurities or non magnetic impurities in non - s - wave superconductors . however , for large disorder , clear departure from the ag formula has been reported in several low dimensional organic superconductors @xcite .",
    "alternative mechanisms have been suggested to account for this peculiar behavior @xcite .",
    "a more detailed discussion is given below .",
    "the outcomes of the studies dealing with the effect of disorder on organic superconductors are consistent with the unconventional character of the superconducting state since the latter is suppressed in presence of non - magnetic impurities@xcite . however , these studies do not state clearly the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter .",
    "experiments carried out on bechgaard salts @xcite show that the upper critical fields @xmath1 along the most conducting axes @xmath12 and @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , are clearly times larger than the pauli paramagnetic limit @xmath16 above which @xmath14 and @xmath15 continue to increase with no sign to saturation . this behavior seems to rule out the singlet state and gives compelling indications of the presence of a spin triplet superconducting phase .",
    "however , the question of the superconducting gap symmetry in bechgaard salts is not settled yet . despite the general tendency to accept the singlet character of the low field state",
    ", the symmetry of the high field phase continues to be a controversial issue @xcite .    in this paper , we first complete the theoretical study presented in ref.@xcite dealing with the role of cooling induced disorder on the inhomogeneous superconducting phase of ( tmtsf)@xmath2clo@xmath4 where it is found that t@xmath11 is strongly suppressed as the mixed character is enhanced .",
    "we then present a quantitative comparison with experiments which was lacking in ref.@xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we give a detailed analysis of the experimental data in quasi-1d and 2d organic superconductors to infer the key parameters used in our model .",
    "we then derive the behavior of t@xmath11 as a function of various types of disorder . to the best of our knowledge",
    "our results are the first to account quantitatively for the suppression of the superconducting transition temperature by various sources of disorder in several organic superconductors .",
    "there is a general consensus , emerging from recent experiments , on the discrepancy between the experimental data obtained at large disorder rate and the results expected from the ag law @xcite .",
    "our work will shed light on the origin of this discrepancy .",
    "we also briefly present in this paper , the effect of inhomogeneity on the upper critical fields in the case of layered organic superconductors where superconducting domains are sandwiched between non - superconducting regions as it has been reported in ( tmtsf)@xmath2pf@xmath5 @xcite . in the next section , we summarize the experimental results related to the dependence of t@xmath11 on disorder in several low dimensional organic superconductors . after a brief comment on the theoretical results presented in literature , we describe , in section 3 ,",
    "the method we used to extract , from the experimental data , the theoretical parameters of the model we described in ref.@xcite . in section 4 , results are discussed in connection with experiments .",
    "it is worth noting that , as done in refs.@xcite , we do not consider a particular symmetry of the superconducting gap .",
    "however , the decrease of t@xmath11 as a function of non magneticc disorder , reported in the present paper , supports the scenario of unconventional superconducting order parameter in the different low dimensional organic superconductors discussed in this work .",
    "this scenario seems to be the subject of a general consensus emerging from the huge experimental results dealing with these compounds @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the debate on the gap symmetry is not completely settled .",
    "when cooled sufficiently slowly , the clo@xmath8 anions in ( tmtsf)@xmath2clo@xmath4 order for entropy reasons @xcite at a structural transition temperature @xmath17 k. the nature of the electronic ground state , stabilized below @xmath18 , is found to be substantially dependent on the cooling rate . in the relaxed state ( r - state ) , obtained for a cooling rate less than 0.1k / min , the ground state is superconducting below 1.2 k @xcite .",
    "however , the quenched state ( q - state ) resulting of a cooling at a rate more than 50k / min , is an insulating spin density wave ( sdw ) @xcite .",
    "the most striking effect of the cooling rate is obtained for intermediate cooling rates at which the sample exhibits an inhomogeneous mixture of superconducting domains ( in which clo@xmath4 anions are ordered ) and sdw regions ( where clo@xmath4 anions are disordered)@xcite.meissner effect signal @xcite showed that , by increasing the cooling rate , the insulating regions get larger at the expense of the superconducting ones .",
    "these results have been corroborated by x - ray study @xcite showing a variation of the fraction of ordered clo@xmath4 domains as a function of the cooling rate .",

    "we assume that the disorder ds not introduce local magnetic impurities in the ordered domains which is consistent with experimental findings .",
    "in this section , we first give a brief review of the theoretical approaches proposed in the literature to explain the behavior of t@xmath11 as a function of disorder in organic conductors .",

    "we propose a method the extract the values of these parameters from the experimental data .",
    "powell and mckenzie @xcite have analyzed , in the framework of the ag law , the experimental results dealing with the effect of different types of disorder on the superconducting transition temperature t@xmath11 of quasi-2d organic conductors .",
    "it is worthwhile reminding that the ag law describes the suppression of t@xmath11 by magnetic impurities for s - wave pairing . for",
    "non - s - wave superconductors , t@xmath11 is suppressed by non - magnetic impurities according also to the ag formula given by @xcite : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the superconducting critical temperature in the pure limit and @xmath24 is the digamma function . @xmath25 is the quasi - particle lifetime due to scattering with magnetic impurities ( @xmath26 ) or non - magnetic impurities ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "powell and mckenzie @xcite compared the experimental data obtained in @xmath28(et)@xmath2x and @xmath3(et)@xmath2x with various types of disorder to the expectations of the ag formula .",
    "they found an excellent agreement using two free parameters to fit the theory .",
    "however , their study was not conclusive concerning the conventional nature of the superconducting order parameter , since the agreement with ag law holds for both magnetic and non - magnetic impurities .",
    "we emphasize that the data analyzed by powell and mckenzie are in the clean limit corresponding to small amounts of disorder which acts as scattering points .",

    "based on epr measurements , the authors @xcite ruled out the magnetic nature of the scattering centers .",
    "the sensitivity of t@xmath11 to the impurity concentration was , therefore , taken as a signature of the unconventional character of the superconducting gap in ( tmtsf)@xmath2clo@xmath4 . despite the good agreement between the ag law and the experimental results in the clean limit of organic conductors ,",
    "a clear discrepancy has been reported in the dirty limit of quasi-2d salts @xcite . to account for this discrepancy , analytis _ et al._@xcite suggested to use a generalized ag formula involving two order parameters with both s - wave and unconventional components .",
    "the presence of two gradients in the impurity induced suppression of t@xmath11 was ascribed to this mixed superconducting ordering .",
    "the rapid decrease of t@xmath11 for small disorder amount is attributed to the non - s - wave part whereas the slowing down of the t@xmath11 suppression is assigned to the s - wave component .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , there is no experimental evidence of such mixed superconducting gap in organic conductors @xcite .",
    "+      recently , we have proposed a model to describe the suppression of the superconducting transition temperature with increasing cooling rate in ( tmtsf)@xmath2clo@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "basically , the model concerns a layered superconductor , where each layer , corresponding to the most conducting plane , has a phase segregation structure with superconducting domains embedded in a non - superconducting host . for simplicity , we assume that the superconducting clusters are identical and form a square lattice . these superconducting regions are interacting via josephson couplings parameterized by @xmath30 and @xmath31 along the inplane directions @xmath12 and @xmath32 respectively .",

    "for example , x ray measurements in ( tmtsf)@xmath2clo@xmath4 @xcite suggested ellipsoidal structure .",
    "one should also consider randomly distributed superconducting clusters instead of the square lattice assumed in our model",
    ". actually , taking into account the thickness of the superconducting domain along the least conducting axis will not change the overall behavior of our results since superconductivity in the considered materials has essentially a two - dimension ( 2d ) character .",
    "moreover , the shape of the superconducting domains is not a key factor in our model as far as the corresponding size is larger than the coherence length to avoid the phase fluctuations complexity .",
    "the basic parameter is the size of the non - superconducting junction on which depend the josephson couplings",
    ". it should be interesting to study the effect of a random distribution of the superconducting clusters which may be introduced by assuming a spatial weight dependence of the inplane josephson coupling parameters .",
    "however , such correction is not expected to affect the outcomes of the present model .",
