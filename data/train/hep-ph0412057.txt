    "recently there have been several experimental reports of hadrons with remarkable and unexpected properties .",
    "these include the surprisingly low mass charm - strange mesons d@xmath0 @xcite and d@xmath1 @xcite , the charmonium or charmed meson molecule candidate x(3872 ) @xcite , and the pentaquark candidate @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "these reports motivate careful , detailed studies of the physics underlying the resonances observed in these sectors , both to determine what properties are expected for accessible states where the calculations are incomplete , and also to determine  what has gone wrong \" with the existing models . in this contribution",
    "we abstract some predictions for properties of higher mass charmonium states ( specifically the spectrum and strong decay widths ) from one such detailed study , which is currently in preparation @xcite ; some closely related results for charmonium were published previously in a study of possible x(3872 ) assignments @xcite .",
    "it is well known that a simple potential model gives a remarkably good description of the charmonium spectrum . the spectrum predicted by a model of this type , including all multiplets with entries below 4.4 gev , is given in table  [ table_spectrum ] .",
    "minimal \" model uses the nonrelativistic schrdinger equation , with a zeroth - order potential consisting of the color coulomb plus linear scalar confining terms and a gaussian - smeared oge spin - spin hyperfine interaction .",
    "the oge spin - orbit and tensor and scalar confinement spin - orbit terms are incorporated in first - order perturbation theory .",
    "the four parameters @xmath3 ( oge strength ) , @xmath4 ( string tension ) , @xmath5 ( charm quark mass ) and @xmath6 ( hyperfine smearing length ) are determined by a fit to the well - established experimental states given in the table .",
    "the results are shown in fig.[spectrum ] , together with the spectrum predicted by the relativized godfrey - isgur model  @xcite .",
    "the spectra are rather similar , although the nr model gives somewhat lower masses for higher - l states , largely due to the choice of a smaller string tension .",
    "we note in passing that recent quenched lgt results for the spectrum of charmonium @xcite are very similar to the predictions of these potential models .",
    "the generic features of the resulting spectrum , which are well known , are slowly decreasing radial excitation energy gaps with increasing n and l , and rapidly decreasing splittings within a multiplet with increasing l ( due to suppressed short - distance wavefunctions ) .",
    "for sufficiently large l the multiplets invert , due to the increased importance of the inverted scalar spin - orbit term .",
    "this effect however may be obscured by other mass shifts .",

    "strong width predictions for higher - mass charmonium states are of great importance , since they indicate which states should be narrow enough to identify easily , and which modes should be favored by a given state .",
    "the dominant strong decays ( when energetically allowed ) are open flavor decays , which in the valence approximation are due to the process @xmath11 .",
    "( here , @xmath12 . )",

    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "application of this model to charmonium gives predictions for all the two - body open charm decay amplitudes and partial widths of every state , which is clearly a great deal of information . in view of the limited space , here we only quote the partial and total widths of the four known states above dd threshold , which are the @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "these results are given in table  [ table_decays ] .",
    "little is known about these strong branching fractions experimentally , which is unfortunate because a striking preference for certain modes is predicted , such as dd@xmath20 being the largest mode of the @xmath19 .",
    "the weakness of @xmath21 agrees with experiment @xcite , but the exclusive branching fractions of the @xmath22 and @xmath19 have unfortunately not been measured .",
    "these exclusive decays will hopefully be studied at cleo - c and bes in the near future .",
    "we also note that the mode d@xmath23d@xmath23 is very interesting , in that it has three @xmath24 waves , @xmath25p@xmath20 , @xmath26p@xmath20 and @xmath26f@xmath20 , and the relative decay amplitudes depend strongly on the nature of the initial @xmath27 state . for s - wave @xmath27 mesons ( presumably including the @xmath28 and @xmath19 ) the @xmath13p@xmath14 model predicts the amplitude ratio @xmath26p@xmath29p@xmath30 and @xmath26f@xmath31 , whereas for the d - wave @xmath22 one finds a dominant @xmath26f@xmath20 amplitude , and @xmath26p@xmath29p@xmath32 .",

    "presumably this is because the large negative mass shift is similar for all the low - lying charmonium states , and can be approximated by a change in the charm quark mass .",
