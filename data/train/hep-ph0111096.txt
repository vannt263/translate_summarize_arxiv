    "<S> production of open and hidden charm hadrons in heavy ion collisions is considered within the statistical coalescence model . charmed quarks and antiquarks </S>",
    "<S> are assumed to be created at the initial stage of the reaction and their number is conserved during the evolution of the system . </S>",
    "<S> they are distributed among open and hidden charm hadrons at the hadronization stage in accordance with laws of statistical mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> the model is in excellent agreement with the experimental data on @xmath0 production in lead - lead collisions at cern sps and predicts strong enhancement of the open charm multiplicity over the standard extrapolation from nucleon - nucleon to nucleus - nucleus collisions . </S>",
    "<S> a possible mechanism of the charm enhancement is proposed .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 meson plays a special role in heavy ion physics . </S>",
    "<S> the interest to it was mainly motivated by the suggestion of matsui and satz @xcite to use charmonia as a probe of the state of matter created in the early stage of the collision .    </S>",
    "<S> the standard picture assumes that charmonia are created exclusively at the initial stage of the reaction in primary nucleon - nucleon collisions . during the subsequent evolution of the system , </S>",
    "<S> the number of hidden charm mesons is reduced because of ( a ) absorption of pre - resonance charmonium states in the nuclei ( normal nuclear suppression ) , ( b ) interactions of charmonia with secondary hadrons ( comovers ) , ( c ) dissociation of @xmath1 bound states in deconfined medium . </S>",
    "<S> it was found that the @xmath0 suppression with respect to drell - yan muon pairs measured in proton - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus collisions with light projectiles can be explained by normal nuclear suppression alone @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the na50 experiment with a heavy projectile and target ( lead - lead ) revealed essentially stronger @xmath0 suppression for central collisions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this _ anomalous _ @xmath0 suppression was attributed to formation of quark - gluon plasma @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> much less attention was paid to the fact that the @xmath0 to drell - yan ratio _ does not _ follow the normal nuclear suppression pattern for _ peripheral _ collisions : the experimental points lie _ above _ the normal nuclear suppression curve ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ jpsi_pbpb ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior can not be explained within the standard scenario : presence of either of two additional mechanisms ( b ) or ( c ) can only destroy the quarkonia that survived absorption by the nuclear nucleons .    </S>",
    "<S> a completely different picture of charmonium production was proposed by gadzicki and gorenstein @xcite : hidden charm mesons are supposed to be created at the hadronization stage . </S>",
    "<S> similar to all other hadrons , their abundancies can be described within the thermal model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , production of heavy quarks in soft processes is expected to be negligible . </S>",
    "<S> most likely , they are produced at the hard stage . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , their number can , generally speaking , deviate from the thermal equilibrium value @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> because of smallness of this number , canonical treatment of the system is important @xcite .    in this talk </S>",
    "<S> i present the results @xcite obtained within the statistical coalescence model @xcite :    * @xmath2 and @xmath3 are created at the initial stage of the reaction in primary hard parton collisions ; * their number remains approximately unchanged during the subsequent evolution ; * they are distributed over open charm hadrons and charmonia at the hadronization stage in accordance with laws of statistical mechanics .    within its applicability domain </S>",
    "<S> , the model demonstrates excellent agreement ( @xmath4 ) with the na50 data on @xmath0 production ( see figure [ jpsi_pbpb ] ) .     to drell - yan ratio on the transversal energy . </S>",
    "<S> the normal nuclear suppression curve is obtained at @xmath5  mb , where @xmath6 is the absorption cross section of preresonant charmonia by nuclear nucleons . </S>",
    "<S> two vertical lines show the applicability domain of the statistical coalescence model ( scm ) , see @xcite for details . </S>",
    "<S> [ jpsi_pbpb ] , height=302 ]    extrapolating the fit to peripheral collisions reveals an interesting feature : our model predicts sharp increase of the ratio with decreasing the number of participants , leading to @xmath0 _ enhancement _ over the nucleon - nucleon collision value . </S>",
    "<S> such behavior is easy to understand : the smaller is the volume of the system the larger is the probability that @xmath2 and @xmath3 meet each other at the hadronization stage and form a hidden charm meson . as is seen from the figure , this enhancement is not obviously supported by the data : our theoretical curve lies above the experimental points in the low @xmath7 region . on the other hand , the normal nuclear suppression model also fails to explain the leftmost point from the 1996 standard analysis set and two leftmost points from the 1996 minimum bias set . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical calculations underestimate the experimental values . </S>",
    "<S> it is natural to assume that an intermediate situation takes place . </S>",
    "<S> some fraction of peripheral pb+pb collisions result in formation of deconfined medium . in these collisions , </S>",
    "<S> charmonia are formed at the hadronization stage , and their multiplicities are given by the statistical coalescence model . </S>",
    "<S> the rest collisions ( we shall call them normal collisions ) do not lead to color deconfinement , therefore charmonia are formed exclusively at the initial stage and then suffer normal nuclear suppression . </S>",
    "<S> the experiment measures the average value , which lies between these two curves . </S>",
    "<S> the fraction of normal events decreases with growing centrality . </S>",
    "<S> their influence on @xmath0 production becomes negligible at @xmath8 .    </S>",
    "<S> the model has two free parameters : @xmath9 , the effective cross section of charm production by a nucleon pair , and @xmath10 , the fraction of @xmath0 satisfying the kinematical conditions of the na50 spectrometer .    </S>",
    "<S> our analysis predicts enhancement of the total charm by a factor of @xmath11@xmath12 ( @xmath13 @xmath14b , comparing with @xmath15 @xmath14b in nucleon - nucleon collisions . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the small value of @xmath16 ( comparing with @xmath17 in nucleon - nucleon collisions ) suggest essential broadening of the @xmath0 rapidity distribution . </S>",
    "<S> assuming approximately the same broadening for the open charm , we obtain the open charm enhancement by a factor of about @xmath18@xmath11 within the rapidity window of the na50 spectrometer . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the indirect experimental result @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a direct measurement of open charm in heavy ion collisions is planed at cern sps . </S>",
    "<S> if the future measurement confirms the enhancement , what kind of mechanism can stay behind this phenomenon ?    </S>",
    "<S> we have demonstrated @xcite that the heavy flavor enhancement may be a signature of color deconfinement . </S>",
    "<S> deconfined medium ( quark - gluon plasma or its precursor ) can influence hadronization of heavy quarks and antiquarks . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to enhanced production of hadrons with open charm and bottom with respect to the direct extrapolation of proton - proton data to heavy nuclei collisions .    to get an intuitive picture of possible medium effects </S>",
    "<S> let us start from open charm production in electron - positron annihilation . </S>",
    "<S> a charm quark - antiquark pair is created in a hard perturbative process . </S>",
    "<S> then it hadronizes into observed particles . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics of the hadronization can be qualitatively understood in the framework of the string picture . when the distance between @xmath2 and @xmath19 reaches the range of confinement forces , a string connecting these colored objects is formed . </S>",
    "<S> if the invariant mass of the quark - antiquark pair @xmath20 lies well above the open charm meson threshold @xmath21 , @xmath2 and @xmath19 break the string into two ( or more ) peaces , so that the final state contains an open charm hadron pair ( and possibly a number of light hadrons ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , when the center - of - mass energy of the initial electron - positron pair exceeds the charm quark threshold ( @xmath22 ) , but lies below the @xmath23-meson threshold ( @xmath24 ) , a @xmath25 pair can be created , but it can not break the string . an open charm hadron pair _ can not _ be formed . eventually the @xmath2 and @xmath19 have to annihilate into lighter hadrons ( or form charmonium states , provided that the energy is sufficient ) .    </S>",
    "<S> let us imagine now @xmath26 annihilation inside deconfined medium . </S>",
    "<S> due to the debye screening , no string is formed between colored objects . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath2 and @xmath19 are created , they _ can _ fly apart within the medium as if they were free particles . </S>",
    "<S> it does not matter whether their initial invariant mass @xmath20 exceeds the @xmath23-meson threshold or not . </S>",
    "<S> the created @xmath25 pair _ is able _ to form an open charm hadron pair at the hadronization . </S>",
    "<S> this means that _ @xmath26 annihilation inside deconfined medium would produce open charm hadrons even if the collision energy is not sufficient for producing these hadrons in vacuum . _    in proton - proton or nucleus - nucleus collisions charm quark - antiquark pairs are produced due to hard _ </S>",
    "<S> parton _ interactions . </S>",
    "<S> calculations in the leading order of perturbative quantum chromodynamics show that a great fraction of @xmath25 pairs is created with invariant masses @xmath20 below the corresponding meson threshold @xmath21 . despite of essential differences between @xmath26 annihilation and nucleon - nucleon ( or nucleus - nucleus ) collisions ( see @xcite for details ) , it is natural to expect that deconfined medium essentially increase the probability of hadronization of @xmath25 pairs with low invariant mass . </S>",
    "<S> _ this should lead to enhanced production of the total charm in nucleus - nucleus collisions in comparison to the standard result obtained within the direct extrapolation of nucleon - nucleon data . </S>",
    "<S> _    we have estimated the upper bound of this enhancement . at sps energies </S>",
    "<S> , one can expect maximal enhancement by a factor of about 6 , which is consistent with our above fit for the @xmath0 to drell - yan ratio .    </S>",
    "<S> i conclude that the na50 data for not very peripheral lead - lead collisions are consistent with the following scenario :    formation of deconfined medium prevents annihilation of charm - anticharm quark pairs with low invariant mass . </S>",
    "<S> this reveals itself in enhanced production of open charm hadrons . </S>",
    "<S> charmonia as well as other hadrons are formed at the hadronization stage . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of charm quarks and antiquarks over open and hidden charm hadrons follows laws of statistical mechanics .    </S>",
    "<S> i am indebted to m.  gorenstein , w.  greiner , l.  mclerran and h.  stcker for fruitful collaboration . </S>",
