    "one of the main approaches to testing the standard model of particle physics and searching for signatures of new physics is to study a large number of physical processes to obtain information about the unitarity triangle and to check its consistency .",
    "the precision with which this check can be accomplished is limited by non - perturbative qcd effects and lattice qcd provides the opportunity to quantify these effects without model assumptions .",
    "of course , lattice computations themselves have a number of sources of systematic uncertainty , and much of our current effort is being devoted to reducing and controlling these errors . in this",
    "talk i briefly discuss the evaluation of quark masses and weak matrix elements using lattice simulations .    for most lattice calculations of physical quantities ,",
    "the principal source of systematic uncertainty is the _ chiral extrapolation _",
    ", i.e. the extrapolation of results obtained with unphysically large @xmath1 and @xmath2 quark masses .",
    "ideally we would like to perform computations with 140mev pions and hence with @xmath3 of about 1/25 ( where @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) is the average light quark mass ( strange quark mass ) ) . in practice values @xmath6 1/2 are fairly typical , so that the milc collaboration s simulation with @xmath7 is particularly impressive  @xcite and provides a challenge to the rest of the community to reach similarly low masses .",
    "its configurations have been widely used to determine physical quantities with small quoted errors .",
    "the milc collaboration uses the staggered formulation of lattice fermions and for a variety of reasons it is very important to verify the results using other formulations . with staggered fermions",
    "each meson comes in 16 _ tastes _ and the unphysical ones are removed by taking the fourth root of the fermion determinant .",
    "although there is no demonstration that this procedure is wrong , there is also no proof that it correctly yields qcd in the continuum limit  @xcite .",
    "the presence of unphysical tastes leads to many parameters to be fit in staggered chiral perturbation theory ( typically many tens of parameters ) and to date the renormalization has only been performed using perturbation theory .",
    "it is therefore pleasing to observe that the challenge of reaching lower masses is being taken up by groups using other formulations of lattice fermions ( see e.g. ref.@xcite ) .    in this talk",
    "i will discuss a selection of issues and results in lattice flavourdynamics .",
    "i start by describing some new thoughts on improving the momentum resolution in simulations , by varying the boundary conditions on the quark fields .",
    "i then review the status of lattice calculations of quark masses , @xmath8 decays ( for which computations have only recently began ) and @xmath9 .",
    "this is followed by a discussion of some of the key issues in the computation of @xmath0 decays and in heavy - quark physics .",
    "numerical simulations of lattice qcd are necessarily performed on a finite spatial volume , @xmath10 . providing that @xmath11 is sufficiently large , we are free to choose any consistent boundary conditions for the fields @xmath12 , and it is conventional to use periodic boundary conditions , @xmath13 ( @xmath14 or 3 ) .",
    "this implies that components of momenta are quantized to take integer values of @xmath15 .",
    "taking a typical example of a lattice with 24 points in each spatial direction , @xmath16 , with a lattice spacing @xmath17fm so that @xmath18gev , we have @xmath19gev .",
    "the available momenta for phenomenological studies ( e.g. in the evaluation of form - factors ) are therefore very limited , with the allowed values of each component @xmath20 separated by about 1/2 gev .",
    "the momentum resolution in such simulations is very poor .",
    "bedaque  @xcite has advocated the use of _ twisted _ boundary conditions for the quark fields @xmath21 e.g. @xmath22 with integer @xmath23 . modifying the boundary conditions",
    "changes the finite - volume effects , however , for quantities which do not involve _ final state interactions _",
    "( e.g. hadronic masses , decay constants , form - factors ) these errors remain exponentially small also with twisted boundary conditions  @xcite . since we usually neglect such errors when using periodic boundary conditions , we can use twisted boundary conditions with the same precision .",
    "moreover the finite - volume errors are also exponentially small for _ partially twisted boundary conditions _ in which the sea quarks satisfy periodic boundary conditions but the valence quarks satisfy twisted boundary conditions  @xcite .",
    "this is of significant practical importance , implying that we do not need to generate new gluon configurations for every choice of twisting angle @xmath24}.    the use of partially twisted boundary conditions opens up many interesting phenomenological applications , solving the problem of poor momentum resolution .",
    "it also appears to work numerically .",
    "consider for example , the plots in fig.[fig : twist ] , obtained using an unquenched ( 2 flavours of sea quarks ) ukqcd simulation on a @xmath25 lattice , with a spacing of about 0.1fm .",
    "the plots correspond to a value for the light - quark masses for which @xmath26  @xcite .",
    "the lower ( upper ) left - hand plot shows the energy of the @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) as a function of the momentum of the meson , and the right - hand plot shows the bare values of the leptonic decay constants @xmath29 and @xmath30 . the @xmath31-axis denotes @xmath32 .",
    "the results are beautifully consistent with expectations ( particularly for @xmath33 where lattice artifacts are small ) ; the predicted dispersion relation is satisfied and the extracted decay constants are independent of the momenta . using periodic boundary conditions only the results at values of @xmath34 indicated by the dashed lines are accessible . with partially twisted boundary conditions all momenta are reachable .",

    "quark masses are fundamental parameters of the standard model , but unlike leptons , quarks are confined inside hadrons and are not observed as physical particles .",
    "quark masses therefore can not be measured directly , but have to be obtained indirectly through their influence on hadronic quantities and this frequently involves non - perturbative qcd effects .",
    "lattice simulations prove to be very useful in the determination of quark masses ; particularly for the light quarks ( @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) for which perturbation theory is inapplicable .    in order to determine the quark masses we compute a convenient and appropriate set of physical quantities ( frequently a set of hadronic masses ) and vary the input masses until the computed values correctly reproduce the set of physical quantities being used for calibration . in this way",
    "we obtain the physical values of the bare quark masses , from which by using perturbation theory , or preferably _ non - perturbative renormalization _ , the results in standard continuum renormalization schemes can be determined .",
    "my current _ best _ estimates for the values of the quark masses as determined from lattice simulations are presented in table [ tab : quark_masses ] .",
    "[ tab : quark_masses ]    .my summary of the status of lattice determinations of quark masses ( in the @xmath40 renormalization scheme ) . for @xmath41 and @xmath5 the results are presented at 2gev and for @xmath42 , the results are presented at the mass itself ( @xmath43 )",
    ". for comparison the values quoted by the pdg in 2004 , using or excluding lattice simulations , are also presented . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     both collaborations obtain a considerable octet enhancement ( significantly driven however , by the chiral extrapolation ) and @xmath44 with the wrong sign .",
    "a particularly impressive feature of these calculations was that the collaborations were able to perform the subtraction of the unphysical terms which diverge as powers of the ultra - violet cut - off ( @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the lattice spacing ) .",
    "the results are very interesting and will provide valuable benchmarks for future calculations , however the limitations of the calculations should be noted , in particular the use of chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath47pt ) only at lowest order .",
    "this has the practical advantage that @xmath0 matrix elements do not have to be evaluated directly , it is sufficient at lowest order to study the mass dependence of the matrix elements @xmath48 and @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is a pseudoscalar meson and the @xmath51 are the @xmath52 operators appearing in the effective hamiltonian , to determine the low - energy constants and hence the amplitudes . it is not very easy to estimate the errors due to this approximation , but they should be at least of @xmath53 . since for @xmath44 the dominant contributions appear to be from the qcd and electroweak penguin operators @xmath54 and @xmath55 , which are comparable in magnitude but",
    "come with opposite signs , it is not totally surprising that the prediction for @xmath44 at lowest order in @xmath47pt has the wrong sign .",
    "it should also be noted that in the simulations described in ref .",
    "@xcite the light quarks masses were large ( the pions were heavier than about 400mev ) and so one can question the validity of @xmath47pt in the range of masses used ( about 400 - 800mev ) .    to improve the precision , apart from performing unquenched simulations and reducing the masses of the light quarks , one needs to go beyond lowest order @xmath47pt ( for example by going to nlo  @xcite ) and , in general , this requires the evaluation of @xmath0 matrix elements and not just @xmath56 ones .",
    "the treatment of two - hadron states in lattice computations has a new set of theoretical issues , most notably the fact that the finite - volume effects decrease only as powers of the volume and not exponentially .",
    "starting with the pioneering work of lscher  @xcite , the theory of finite - volume effects for two - hadron states in the elastic regime is now fully understood , both in the centre - of - mass and moving frames ,  @xcite@xcite and i will now briefly discuss this .",
    "consider the two - hadron correlation function represented by the diagram    ( 280,30)(-10,-10 ) ( 30,0)(10,20)(0)(70,0)(10,20)(0 ) ( 110,0)(10,20)(0)(150,0)(10,20)(0 ) ( 190,0)(10,20)(0)(230,0)(10,20)(0)(-10,10)(10,0)(-10,-10)(10,0 ) ( 250,0)(270,10)(250,0)(270,-10 ) ( 10,0)50.75(50,0)50.75 ( 90,0)50.75 ( 130,0)50.75 ( 170,0)50.75(210,0)50.75 ( 250,0)50.75(149.5,10)(150.5,10)(150,16)[b]@xmath57 ( -10,0)[r]@xmath58    where the shaded circles represent two - particle irreducible contributions in the @xmath39-channel .",
    "for simplicity let us take the two - hadron system to be in the centre - of mass frame and assume that only the @xmath39-wave phase - shift is significant ( the discussion can be extended to include higher partial waves ) .",
    "consider the loop integration / summation over @xmath57 ( see the figure ) . performing the @xmath59 integration by contours ,",
    "we obtain a summation over the spatial momenta of the form : @xmath60 where the relative momentum @xmath61 is related to the energy by @xmath62 , the function @xmath63 is non - singular and ( for periodic boundary conditions ) the summation is over momenta @xmath64 where @xmath65 is a vector of integers . in infinite volume the summation in eq.([eq : fv ] )",
    "is replaced by an integral and it is the difference between the summation and integration which gives the finite - volume corrections .",
    "the relation between finite - volume sums and infinite - volume integrals is the _ poisson summation formula _ , which ( in 1-dimension ) is : @xmath66 if the function @xmath67 is non - singular , the oscillating factors on the right - hand side ensures that only the term with @xmath68 contributes , up to terms which vanish exponentially with @xmath69 .",
    "the summand in eq.([eq : fv ] ) on the other hand is singular ( there is a pole at @xmath70 ) and this is the reason why the finite - volume corrections only decrease as powers of @xmath69 .",
    "the detailed derivation of the formulae for the finite - volume corrections can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite@xcite and is beyond the scope of this talk .",
    "the results hold not only for @xmath0 decays , but also for @xmath27-nucleon and nucleon - nucleon systems .    for decays",
    "in which the two - pions have isospin 2 , we now have all the necessary techniques to calculate the matrix elements with good precision and such computations are underway . for decays into two - pion states with isospin 0",
    "there are also no barriers in principle .",
    "however , in this case , purely gluonic intermediate states contribute and we need to learn how to calculate the corresponding disconnected diagrams with sufficient precision .",
    "in addition the subtraction of power - like ultraviolet divergences requires large datasets ( as demonstrated in refs.@xcite in quenched qcd ) . for these reasons",
    "it will take a longer time for some of the @xmath71 matrix elements to be computed than @xmath72 ones .",
    "lattice simulations are playing an important role in the determination of physical quantities in heavy quark physics including decay constants ( @xmath73 ) , the @xmath74-parameters of @xmath75 mixing ( from which the ckm matrix elements @xmath76 and @xmath77 can be determined ) , form - factors of semileptonic decays ( which give @xmath78 and @xmath79 ) , the @xmath80 coupling constant of heavy - meson chiral perturbation theory and the lifetimes of beauty hadrons .    the typical lattice spacing in current simulations @xmath81fm is larger than the compton wavelength of the @xmath82-quark and comparable to that of the @xmath83-quark .",
    "the simulations are therefore generally performed using effective theories , such as the heavy quark effective theory or non - relativistic qcd .",
    "another interesting approach was proposed by the fermilab group  @xcite , in which the action is _ improved _ to the extent that , in principle at least , artefacts of @xmath84 are eliminated for all @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the mass of the heavy quark @xmath87 .",
    "determining the coefficients of the operators in these actions requires matching with qcd , and this matching is almost always performed using perturbation theory ( most often at one - loop order ) .",
    "this is a significant source of uncertainty and provides the motivation for attempts to develop non - perturbative matching techniques .",
    "i only have time here to consider very briefly a single topic , semileptonic @xmath74-decays . for @xmath88 decays ,",
    "the pion s momentum has to be small in order to avoid large lattice artefacts , so that @xmath89 is large ( @xmath90gev@xmath91 or so ) .",
    "there continues to be a considerable effort in extrapolating these results over the whole @xmath92 range .",
    "recently , as experimental results begin to be presented in @xmath92 bins , it has become possible to combine the lattice results at large @xmath92 with the binned experimental results and theoretical constraints to obtain @xmath79 with good precision  @xcite .    as an example i present a recent result , obtained using the milc gauge field configurations with staggered light quarks and the fermilab action for the @xmath82-quark  @xcite + @xmath93",
    "i mention that other semileptonic decays of heavy mesons are also being studied , including @xmath94 decays ( a recent result is @xmath95  @xcite ) and @xmath96 decays .",
    "lattice qcd simulations , in partnership with experiments and theory , play a central rle in the determination of the fundamental parameters of the standard model ( e.g. quark masses , ckm matrix elements ) and in searches for signatures of new physics and ultimately perhaps will help to unravel its structure . with the advent of unquenched simulations , a major source of uncontrolled systematic uncertainty has been eliminated and the main aim now is to control the chiral extrapolation and reduce other systematic uncertainties .",
    "we continue to extend the range of applicability of lattice simulations to more processes and physical quantities . in this talk",
    "i have only been able to give a small selection of recent results and developments ; a more complete set can be found on the web - site of the 2005 international symposium on lattice field theory  @xcite .",
