    "a significant contribution from accreting binary stars to the total x - ray emission of early - type galaxies has been predicted for a long time , using the x - ray / optical luminosity ratio and spectral energy distribution ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) as primary indicators , long before the majority of x - ray sources could be resolved individually . with the launch of _ chandra _ , with its sub - arcsecond spatial resolution , tens to hundreds of low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxb )",
    "were discovered in nearby ellipticals , a large number of which are residing in globular clusters ( gc ) , with a complex dependence on the properties of the host galaxy and of the gc population .",
    "several studies have shown that while on average a few percent ( @xmath3 ) of gcs host lmxbs , the fraction of lmxbs residing in gcs varies from @xmath4 in late - type galaxies and reaches up to @xmath5 in cd galaxies , depending on the morphological type of the galaxy and on the gc specific frequency ( see review in * ? ? ?",
    "it was also observed that lmxbs reside preferentially in bright gcs @xcite , as expected if dynamical interactions favor binary formation in dense environments @xcite .",
    "more puzzling is the dependence of the probability of finding lmxbs on the gc color .",
    "recent studies indicate that red ( old , metal - rich ) gcs are @xmath6 times more likely to host lmxbs than blue ( young , metal - poor ) ones @xcite .    the spatial distribution of lmxbs is also debated : while some studies find that the spatial distribution of gc - lmxbs is more extended than field - lmxbs @xcite , others do not observe such a difference ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "the issue is further complicated by the fact that for a proper comparison with the distribution of host gcs , the samples must be split according to gc colors ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "constraining these observables is crucial for discriminating among lmxb formation models .",
    "for instance , irradiation - induced winds @xcite , magnetic breaking @xcite or imf variations ( @xcite , ( also see * ? ? ? * ) ) can explain the lmxb formation likelihood as a function of the host gc color in terms of a metallicity effect , while other dynamical models ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggest that this color dependence may reflect the higher lmxb formation efficiency in more centrally - concentrated red gcs .",
    "two main observational problems affect our current ability to understand the importance of external dynamical factors governing the lmxb formation in gcs .",
    "first , most studies of the lmxb / gc connection have been restricted to the central regions of nearby ellipticals , due to the limited field of view ( fov ) surveyed by space observatories , i.e.  hst and _ chandra _ , whose high spatial resolution is required to minimize the positional uncertainties and reduce the background contamination .",
    "this has prevented detailed studies of how the distance from the galaxy center and orbital motions affect the lmxb formation efficiency in gcs .",
    "furthermore , since the radial distributions of red and blue gc are known to be different , with the former being more centrally - concentrated than the latter , a restricted fov introduces systematic sample selection biases .",
    "the few wide - field studies that have tried to address this issue from the ground ( see @xmath7 [ discussion ] ) , did not yield conclusive results due to the large background contamination .",
    "second , until a few years ago little was known about gc sizes outside the local group ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , due to angular resolution and fov limits of earlier generations of hst instruments .",
    "the hst / acs camera with its high spatial resolution and efficiency has more recently allowed us to resolve gc sizes in many nearby massive ellipticals down to a few pc ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "again , these studies are mainly limited to the central regions of the galaxy and to the brightest gcs .",
    "in this context we initiated a project to perform a wide - field , high spatial - resolution study of gcs and lmxbs in one of the closest giant ellipticals , ngc  1399 , with a very rich gc system . located at about 20 mpc distance ( @xmath8 mpc ,",
    "see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this galaxy is near enough to resolve gc sizes with acs , while distant enough to sample efficiently the gc distribution out to large galactocentric radii .",
    "furthermore this object is believed to have one of the highest fractions of lmxbs residing in gcs @xcite , thus providing a large sample of field- and gc - lmxbs .    in a parallel article to this one (",
    "* in prep .",
    "- hereafter p11 ) we present the hst / acs data and structural parameter analysis . here",
    "we focus on the gc / lmxb connection and discusses its dependence on galactocentric distance and gc properties .",
    "a detailed description of the hst data and source catalogs are given in p11 .",
    "here we briefly summarize the properties of the optical dataset for the sake of completeness .",
    "the optical data were taken with the _ advanced camera for surveys _",
    "( acs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) onboard the _ hubble space telescope _ ( go-10129 ) , in the f606w filter with a total integration time of 2108 seconds per pointing .",
    "the observations were arranged in a @xmath9 acs mosaic as illustrated in figure  [ fov ] .",
    "the individual observations were dithered to allow sub - pixel sampling of the acs psf and combined into a single image using the multidrizzle routine @xcite .",

    "the field of view of the acs mosaic covers @xmath19 square arcminutes and extends out to a maximum projected galactocentric distance of @xmath20 kpc with respect to ngc  1399 , i.e.  @xmath21 effective radii of the diffuse galaxy light @xcite and @xmath22 core radii of the globular cluster system density profile @xcite .",
    "source catalogs were generated with sextractor , using the appropriate weight maps produced by the multidrizzle procedure , requiring a minimum area of 20 pixels and total s / n@xmath23 .",
    "the catalog astrometric solution was registered using the usno - b1 catalog as a reference frame .",
    "bright , unsaturated stars were identified in all acs frames and matched with usno - b1 sources obtaining a final accuracy of 0.2  r.m.s .",
    "brightness estimates @xmath24 in the stmag photometric system for all detected sources were derived from isophotal magnitudes measured by sextractor .",
    "while this approach is not optimal for resolved gcs , our accuracy is appropriate for the present work .",
    "refined photometry for all gc candidates is computed in p11 in the vegamag system , and compares well with our measurement , yielding an average conversion factor of @xmath25 mag at @xmath26 mag with a scatter of 0.04 mag .",
    "since no complete color catalog was available for the whole field , gc candidates were selected based on magnitude and morphological classification , choosing sources with sextractor stellarity index @xmath27 and magnitude @xmath28 mag in order to exclude extended sources and compact background galaxies .",
    "the magnitude distribution of all point - like sources in our fields is shown in figure  [ maghisto ] .",
    "the distribution closely follows the gc luminosity function down to @xmath29 mag ; at fainter magnitudes background unresolved sources dominate the number counts .    to include optical color information in our analysis we use the @xcite @xmath30 ground - based gc catalog and harris @xmath31 .",
    "the standard stars were instead taken in washington @xmath32 and colors @xmath30",

    "gcs were divided into blue and red populations as described in table  [ col_sel ] ; note that the magnitude limit is chosen to ensure an approximately uniform completeness across the whole color and galactocentric distance range ( figure [ col_mag ] , also see @xcite ) .    in order to confirm the reliability of our gc selection method , based on single - band f606w photometry , and compare it with the color - selection usually adopted in the literature",
    ", we measure the fraction of gc candidates within the subset of sources with color information . assuming that bona - fide gcs are represented by sources within the color ranges presented in table [ col_sel ] , we derive two different estimates : i ) for the central region covered by the more accurate @xmath36 and @xmath37 hst photometry and , ii ) for the entire field covered by the ground based @xmath38 and @xmath32 data . within the central region @xmath39 of our gc candidates ( within @xmath40 by definition )",

    "the estimates based on @xmath30 selection however , must be regarded as a lower limit , since using our f606w single - band hst data we find that @xmath45 of the sources which have @xmath30 color consistent with gcs , are resolved as extended background galaxies . ] on the other hand , @xmath46 and @xmath47 of the gc candidates have respectively @xmath34 and @xmath30 colors outside the allowed range as given in table [ col_sel ] .",
    "we point out that using our stellarity selection criteria , we are able to effectively remove background galaxies since the fraction of such contaminants , which is expected to increase at large radii , varies by only by a few percent ( from @xmath48 to @xmath45 ) across our entire fov .",
    "also note that in the following sections we treat the @xmath30 and @xmath34 subsamples separately when the different completeness levels may affect our conclusions .    to test whether very extended gcs are misclassified by our selection criteria , we estimated the completeness of our bona - fide gc sample as a function of gc size for the subset of optical sources with measured structural parameters ( see @xmath7 [ struct_parms ] ) ; in figure [ size_distro ]",
    "we show the effective radius distribution of the gc candidates samples , finding that our completeness drops below @xmath49 only for @xmath50 pc , with respect to color selected gcs",
    ". we also verified that relaxing the stellarity index criterium does not increase the completeness for large ( @xmath50 pc ) gcs since these are fully resolved on our hst images , while increasing significantly the contamination level .    ) within the hst fov .",
    "also shown is the color - selected ( table [ col_sel ] ) subsample of pointlike sources.,width=321 ]     pc .",
    "the shaded region highlights the region where our size measurement are poorly constrained ( see @xmath7 [ struct_parms]).,width=321 ]      the x - ray data were retrieved from the _ chandra _ public archive .",
    "we selected observations # 319 and # 1472 , i.e. two imaging datasets with the long exposure times where ngc  1399 lies close to the acis aimpoint , for a total exposure time of @xmath51 ks .",
    "the x - ray data were reduced with the ciao software , extracting standard - grade events after applying bad pixel mask and afterglow corrections .",
    "the final exposure times , after removing high background periods , are shown in table [ table_obs ] . to maximize the astrometric accuracy of the observations particular care was taken to correct for known offsets and to reproject the aspect solution and the event files of the individual observations using the ngc  1399 centroid as a reference point . in both cases",
    "the total offset was @xmath52 . to minimize the uncertainties due to completeness variations over the fov",
    ", we limited our analysis to the region in common to acis - i , acis - s and hst / acs ( see figure [ fov ] ) .",

    "the registered observations were then aligned using the wavedetect catalogs with a residual positional uncertainty of 0.3  r.m.s . and merged .",
    "exposure maps were generated for both the individual observations and the merged dataset , and a merged source catalog was generated with wavdetect . in generating the x - ray catalogs",
    "the detection algorithm was run on both the whole @xmath55 kev energy band and on the @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 narrow bands , finding @xmath59 additional sources detected only in one of the narrow bands out of a total of 230 x - ray sources .",
    "for comparison with the literature , we note that 38 sources were not detected in the # 319 dataset ( cf . * ? ? ? * ) and half of these were only detected in the merged dataset .",
    "we used the acis extract software ( ae , * ? ? ? * ) to account for the variable psf in the two x - ray datasets , as well as to improve the positional accuracy .",
    "ae uses library templates of the acis psf to model the actual observed psf for each observation , as well as for the composite one , allowing to derive source positions , properties and detection likelihood .",
    "we feed ae with the final source list derived from combining both individual and merged wavdetect catalogs .",
    "each source was then inspected individually to check the position accuracy and to remove spurious objects due to poor data quality ( very faint sources , high x - ray background in the field center , overlapping sources etc . ) , resulting in the removal of 3 objects , in agreement with the contamination expected based on the wavdetect significance threshold .",
    "the ae software provides three different position estimates : input catalog , data centroid and correlation peak ; our tests ( as well as the ae manual ) suggest that the ` data centroid ' is the best estimate of the source position .",
    "furthermore , we found that it is quite consistent with the wavdetect positions within @xmath60 except for the faintest objects and those farthest from the aimpoint where the difference can reach 0.5 .  for three sources we decided to adopt the correlation peak which seemed a more reliable estimate after visual inspection",
    "; in any case , the difference between these estimates was always @xmath52 .",
    "finally the source catalogs were registered to the usno - b1 reference frame using bright x - ray sources with optical counterparts ( mostly gcs ) .",
    "the final accuracy of the x - ray catalog is 0.33  with a maximum systematic offset of 0.6 .",
    "the properties of the 230 x - ray sources in the composite _ chandra_/hst fov are summarized in table [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "to match the optical and x - ray sources we used the final catalogs registered on the usno - b1 reference frame described in previous sections .",
    "since the accuracy of the optical catalogs is @xmath61 while the x - ray one has @xmath62 , we adopted a conservative @xmath63 matching radius of 1 . furthermore four sources , lying within the central 15  of the galaxy , were excluded from the analysis because of the strong galaxy light contribution , both in optical and x - rays .",
    "our matching algorithm thus yields 164 x - ray sources with optical counterparts , out of which 136 are matched with gc candidates .",
    "note that 75% of these objects are matched within 0.5 .",
    "when multiple optical counterparts ( usually 2 ) were present , i.e. for @xmath64 of the sample , we choose the closest one as the most likely match ; however we verified that our conclusions do not change if we exclude such sources from our sample . while the matching accuracy is expected to depend on the galactocentric distance , mainly due to the larger _ chandra _ psf toward the outskirts of the acis fov , we verified that even at large radii ( @xmath65 arcmin ) doubling the matching radius results in a mild ( @xmath45 ) gain in the number of matched sources , while increasing by @xmath66 the contamination level ( see below ) .",
    "our conservative choice thus minimizes the contamination at the cost of losing some of the fainter x - ray sources in the galaxy outskirts ( cf .",
    "figure [ lf ] ) .",
    "the properties of the closest optical counterpart for each x - ray source are reported in table [ tbl-1 ] .    adopting an optical source surface density ranging from 0.05 src / sq.arcsec in the central hst field , to 0.03 src / sq.arcsec in the southern field ,",
    "the average chance of a random match with an x - ray source within our fiducial radius is @xmath67 , which drops to 4% considering only globular cluster candidates which have a factor @xmath68 lower surface density . assuming a contamination of @xmath69 background agns @xcite , these figures result in ngc  1399 having a fraction of lmxbs residing in gcs of @xmath70 , in good agreement with previous estimates @xcite .",
    "this value , however , depends on galactocentric distance ranging from @xmath71 within the central 50  to 68% ( 77% ) for @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "x - ray sources tend to reside in compact bright optical counterparts , i.e. bright gcs ( figure  [ maghisto ] ) : only 28 out of 164 objects ( @xmath74 ) are in fact associated with extended sources .",
    "the fraction of gcs hosting an x - ray source ( @xmath75 ) drops with magnitude from @xmath76 to @xmath77 and depends on radial distance and color of the host gc ( figure  [ lmxb_frac ] ) .",
    "the drop in the brightest magnitude bins is due to a combination of the different radial profile of the red and blue gc populations ( @xmath7[rad_dep ] ) coupled with the lack of bright red gcs , compared to the blue population , in particular in the galaxy center ( cf .",
    "figure  [ col_mag ] ) mag . ] .",
    "we do not observe any significant difference in @xmath75 in the red and blue sub - population as a function of radius when also splitting in luminosity bins , although our sample is too small to draw definitive conclusions . in any case",
    "we stress that this interplay between gc galactocentric distance , magnitude , and color must be taken into account in studies observing only the central regions of galaxies .",
    "finally note that these results are affected relatively little by our gc selection criteria , since the majority of x - ray sources matched to an optical counterpart reside in compact objects ( see @xmath7[struct_parms ] ) : even considering that we may be missing part of the most extended gcs ( see @xmath7[opt_data_sect ] ) , this would result in a lower @xmath75 by a few percent and anyway within the statistical uncertainties .      for each x - ray source in our catalog , the acis extract procedure ( see  [ chandra_data ] )",
    "computes the incident photon flux , applying the quantum efficiency and spectral response corrections ( i.e. using the arf and rmfs ) appropriate for each observation at the specific detector location , which are then combined in a final weighted average .",
    "this ensures that the position and time dependence of the acis efficiency is properly taken into account .",
    "the x - ray luminosity function ( lf ) of lmxbs in ngc  1399 was obtained applying an average conversion factor to the photon fluxes measured by ae , computed assuming a power - law spectrum with @xmath78 and a galactic column density of @xmath79 @xmath80 , which corresponds to the spectral model for our average source ( figure  [ hr_col ] ) . to correct for contamination due to background sources we used the agn number counts of @xcite .",
    "the cumulative lf of both gc- and field - lmxbs , shown in figure  [ lf ] ( left panel ) , has a power - law shape down to @xmath81 erg s@xmath2 . at fainter fluxes",
    "the combined effect of incompleteness and source variability may affect the lf shape . to correct for incompleteness",
    ", due to the variable psf over the fov and the diffuse x - ray emission , we adopted the `` forward '' procedure described in @xcite , accounting for the effect of background , source counts and distance from the aimpoint .",
    "the detection probabilities as a function of source number counts , at various off - axis angles , are shown in figure  [ det_prob ] .        since x - ray binaries are intrinsically variable , finite integration times may influence their detectability . moreover",
    ", the effect of variability on stacked observations may change the lf slope close to the completeness limit of the individual observations , as discussed in detail by @xcite .",
    "we verified that the lf of the individual _ chandra _ observations ( # 319 and # 1472 ) are consistent within the statistical uncertainties , except for the somewhat shallower completeness limit due to the shorter exposure time .",
    "the completeness corrected gc - lmxb lf follows a power - law down to @xmath82 erg s@xmath2 with a differential slope of @xmath83 in the @xmath84 erg / s range , in good agreement with the one derived by @xcite from a sample of six early - type galaxies .",
    "some residual incompleteness can be observed in the faintest bins ( @xmath85 counts ) mainly due to the very high background in the galaxy center .",
    "in fact splitting the lf in radial bins ( figure [ lf ] , right panel ) shows that the intermediate bin ( 120 - 180 ) , which covers the range of maximum completeness ( figure  [ det_prob ] ) does not deviate significantly from a power - law down to @xmath86 erg s@xmath2 and below .",
    "the gc - lmxb lf in the outermost radial bin presents an excess of bright ( @xmath87 erg s@xmath2 ) sources with respect to the inner regions of the galaxy , suggesting that there may be some residual contamination from background sources in the galaxy outskirts .",
    "in fact only one x - ray source is detected at @xmath1 erg s@xmath2 in the color - selected gc sample ( see below ) .",
    "we do not detect any significant difference in the cumulative lf as a function of the host gc color .",
    "figure  [ lf_col ] shows that the lfs of red and blue gc - lmxb are statistically indistinguihable according to a k - s test , and that they are consistent with the global lf except at the very bright end . for @xmath88 erg s@xmath2 ,",
    "two sources included in the gc - lmxb lf in figure  [ lf ] have no color information , while other three x - ray sources associated with compact optical counterparts have colors outside the selected range ( table  [ col_sel ] ) and thus likely represent interlopers .",
    "our field - lmxb lf is somewhat steeper than the literature estimate , altough consistent within the errors , with a differential slope of @xmath89 in the @xmath84 erg / s range .",
    "furthermore it suggests a lack of bright lmxbs above @xmath90 : assuming for field lmxbs the same underlying distribution as observed for gc - lmxbs , and considering that we have about twice as many lmxb in gc than in the field , the probability of observing no field source above @xmath91 erg / s is @xmath92 , incresing to @xmath93 if we allow for cosmic variance in the agn number counts ( which dominate at bright fluxes ) by a factor 2 .",
    "we find that this significance does not depend on galactocentric distance , and is also confirmed when analyzing the individual x - ray observations # 319 and # 1472 separately .        the lmxb x - ray luminosity is shown in figure [ lx_r ] as a function of galactocentric radius .",

    "the difference disappears but here the smaller number of sources and the background contamination , which affects mainly field lmxbs , makes any conclusion tentative . to check that this difference is not the result of a sampling effect due to the fact that we are observing about twice as many gc- than field - lmxbs",

    "while these results suggest that bright x - ray sources in gcs are not simply due to the superposition of several low luminosity binaries , we can not exclude , based only on temporal analysis , that some gc host multiple lmxbs , since the observed variability can be easily accounted for if , e.g. , a bright source dominates the lmxb population within a gc .    on the other hand in the only color - confirmed gc - lmxbs ( source no.141 in table [ tbl-1 ] ) with @xmath111",

    "the figure indicates that lmxbs are preferentially hosted by high central surface brightness and/or high interaction rate gcs at all galactocentric radii , independent of the host gc color .",

    "we conclude that the different fraction of lmxbs observed between the red and blue gc sub - population can not be attributed to differences only in their structural parameters , thus , supporting the view that stellar evolution @xcite and/or mass segregation effects @xcite must influence lmxb formation .    to quantify the likelihood that gc structure has an impact on lmxb formation , in addition to luminosity and color , we resampled the photometric gc dataset to match the xgc optical luminosity and @xmath30 color distribution .",

    "while the exact value of @xmath146 is affected by large uncertainties , in particular near the center of the galaxy due to the high x - ray background , an increase of @xmath146 with galactocentric distance is in agreement with the fact that the radial distribution of gcs in ngc  1399 is more extended than the galaxy light , while field lmxbs tend to follow instead the galaxy surface brightness profile ( @xmath7 [ rad_dep ] ) .",
    "thus , some care must be taken when comparing different @xmath146 estimates , sampling different galactocentric distances . in this respect",

    "however this population seems to disappear at larger galactocentric distances , where the overall gc population , including those hosting lmxbs , moves toward bluer colors .",
    "while the presence of a similar very red sub - population was not observed in the other 4 galaxies studied by the latter authors , a more homogeneous dataset probing large galactocentric distances , is needed to address the problem of the universality of such feature and its role in lmxb formation .",
    "studies of the radial distribution of lmxbs in the past yielded apparently contrasting results . for instance , @xcite and @xcite found that lmxbs follow the host galaxy light distribution in ngc  1316 and ngc  1332 , while in ngc  4472 @xcite find that lmxbs follow the gc distribution better than the optical light .",

    "furthermore , the interplay between the spatial and color distribution of the gc sample may explain the discrepancies , since blue and red gcs have different radial distributions and host different fractions of the lmxb population .    in the case of ngc  1399 , we find that the radial distribution of field - lmxbs out to @xmath162 of the diffuse galaxy light , is significantly steeper than gc - lmxbs , with a statistical significance @xmath117 , in agreement with the results of @xcite for a sample of five early - type galaxies , however , with smaller galactocentric coverage .",
    "this result supports the conclusion that field lmxbs are not likely to be formed in gcs and later expelled by three- and four - body interactions , as proposed by e.g. @xcite , since in such a case field- and gc - lmxbs would be expected to have similar radial surface density profiles .",
    "field lmxbs ( figure  [ rad_prof ] , left panel ) follow , in fact , the surface brightness of their host galaxy , suggesting an evolutionary connection to the main stellar body of the galaxy rather than to gcs .",
    "gc destruction has been proposed as an alternative mechanism to produce field lmxbs ; in this scenario the increased strength of tidal fields in the galaxy core would result in a field lmxb distribution more centrally concentrated than the one of their parent gc population if they were preferentially formed in gcs that moved through the galaxy core regions .",
    "the effect of the tidal field of the host galaxy on the gc population is possibly observed in the @xmath76 smaller sizes of the total gc populations ( blue and red gcs ) within the central 10 kpc ( @xmath163 , see p11 ) .",
    "note , however , that given the low fraction of gc - hosting lmxbs and its dependence on the host gc color , the production of all field lmxbs in gc requires the disruption of a very large fraction of stellar systems , and a very finely tuned interplay between the original host gc system , color and spatial distribution to reproduce the observed distributions . on the other hand",

    "thus , we can not exclude with certainty that the observed size difference reflects differences in the parent gc population .",
    "@xcite , in their study of the sombrero galaxy ( ngc 4594 ) , noted that if there is a radial gradient in gc sizes , projection effects may be responsible for the observed size difference between red and blue subpopulations due to their different spatial distribution .",
    "our results however show that the size difference between red and blue gcs extends out to large galactocentric radii where projection effects are less pronounced , thus arguing in favour of an intrinsic effect on the lmxb formation efficiency .    in general ,",
    "lmxbs prefer high encounter - rate systems , independent of their host gc color , as expected if the formation of close binaries is favoured in high density environments .",
    "however we observe that gc mass still plays a significant role even after removing the dependence on central surface brightness and encounter rate .",
    "in particular , while in less massive gcs our findings are in agreement with those of @xcite , at odds with the latter works is the fact that gcs with luminosities @xmath166 mag ( @xmath167 mag ) preferentially host lmxbs independent of their structural properties .",
    "we point out that this result is confirmed also if we limit the analysis to the central @xmath168 from the galaxy center and is thus not affected by contamination problems which would be important mainly in the galaxy outskirts .",
    "this result could be explained if massive clusters are more efficient in retaining a larger fraction of their neutron stars @xcite .",
    "however @xcite , evaluating a range of possible sne kick distributions and gc potentials , conclude that in most cases the estimated retention fraction produces a simple linear dependence of the likelihood to find a lmxb on gc mass",
    ". a possible solution would be to assume that if sn kicks follow a bimodal distribution peaked around 10 and 200 km / s , as proposed as one of the most likely scenarios by the latter authors , the most massive gcs are able to retain some of the fast neutron stars , thus disrupting the otherwise linear dependence on gc mass .",
    "in such case it is possible that previous studies have missed this effect due to , e.g. , the binning adopted in @xcite , or the small number of extremely bright clusters found in m31 by @xcite .",
    "while it is indeed difficulty to measure structural parameters for gcs more distant than 10 mpc , we point out that our results are based on the relative differences between subsamples within the same dataset , which are more robust than the absolute values .",
    "furthermore , following @xcite , we did test our results using the more robust effective radius , instead of the core radius , to compute the interaction rate @xmath142 .",
    "we find no significant change in the results , with the exception of figure 16 , where the difference in interaction rate between the global gc population and x - ray gcs as a function of magnitude becomes smaller .",
    "this would enhance the contrast with previous results , in making structural parameters even less important for lmxb formation .",
    "we conclude that the collision rates computed using the estimated core radii have more predictive power for whether a cluster will contain an x - ray source than collision rates computed using the half - light radius .",
    "this is unsurprising , since the core radii and half - light radii are not well correlated in globular clusters , and the bulk of dynamical interactions take place within the cluster cores .",
    "the x - ray properties ( luminosity function , hardness ratios ) of the lmxb population are in fair agreement with the literature , but we observe a marginally steeper lf for field lmxbs ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "we do not observe any correlation between lmxb properties ( luminosity , spectral hardness , variability ) and those of the host gcs , indicating that the lmxb evolution ( if not the formation ) is primarily driven by the properties of the stellar binary system and not of the host gc .",
    "our temporal analysis supports the view that most of the x - ray emission from gcs is produced by a single accreting binary since a significant fraction of the bright lmxbs shows signs of variability , as do lmxbs in the more massive gcs . on the other hand",
    "the steeper lf of field lmxbs and the brighter median lmxb luminosity observed in the galaxy center , suggest that some of the brighest gcs may harbor multiple accreting binaries ( if we assume that all lmxbs share the same intrinsic lf ) , in agreement with the conclusions of , e.g. , @xcite based on a larger sample of early - type galaxies or @xcite for ngc 4278 , and as observed in the galactic gc m15 by @xcite .    in particular the brightest color - confirmed gc x - ray source ( @xmath169 erg s@xmath2 ) , which resides in one of the most metal - rich gc , does not exhibit signs of variability , possibly indicating the presence of multiple accreting x - ray binaries .",
    "thus we can not confirm the presence of intermediate - mass black holes with average @xmath170 , as reported by @xcite .",
