    "graphene may contain defects .",
    "this is now an established fact as it has been directly imaged , thanks to atomic resolution electron microscopy @xcite .",
    "defects in graphene have first been obtained by reconstruction around vacancies formed during electron irradiation and leading to pseudo amorphous domains made of pentagons , hexagons and heptagons @xcite .",
    "they can also show some ordering as observed by lahiri _",
    "@xcite , who describe an extended defect line , made of a periodic repetition of two adjacent pentagons and an octagon , in a graphene sheet epitaxially grown on a ni substrate with a tilt boundary .",
    "defects affect the properties of graphene , for the bad in most cases but also sometimes for the good as in the case of lahiri _ et al . _ where the line defect gives to the sheet the electronic properties of a one - dimensional metallic wire @xcite . the quest for stable space - filling one- or two - dimensional structural patterns has started long ago in the virtual world , actually much before the experimental characterization of such defects , thanks to _ ab - initio _ and force - fields based modeling approaches @xcite .",
    "somehow , the computer - aided design of new graphene allotropes with targeted electronic or mechanical properties is even becoming a new area in carbon science @xcite .",
    "among all the structures proposed so far , hexagonal haeckelite @xmath0 has the lowest energy above graphene @xcite .",
    "this can be explained by the absence of adjacent pentagonal rings and its high density of pentagon - heptagon ( @xmath1 ) pairs , a remarkably stable pattern @xcite .",
    "two years ago , some of us have developed a new computational method based on a combination of image processing and atomistic simulation , the image guided atomistic reconstruction ( igar ) method @xcite , aiming at building atomistic models of dense , disordered yet nanostructured , carbons on the basis of their high resolution transmission electron microscopy ( hrtem ) lattice fringe images . in this approach ,",
    "a 3d analogue of the 2d hrtem image is constructed and serves as an external potential field , pushing the atoms towards the dark areas of the image during a liquid quench molecular dynamics simulation of a carbon system , in which carbon - carbon interactions are taken into account by a reactive empirical bond order potential @xcite .",
    "a snapshot of a carbon sheet taken from a model of a rough laminar pyrolytic carbon @xcite , reconstructed with this method , is shown figure [ defects]a . as can be seen",
    ", the sheet is made of disoriented purely hexagonal domains ( light grey ) bound together by defective planar areas made essentially of @xmath1 pairs ( dark grey ) and more precisely lines of @xmath1 pairs as indicated by the blue solid lines .",
    "this agrees very well with some recent theoretical studies on dislocations in graphene showing the high stability of the @xmath1 pattern @xcite .",
    "also , and even though the way this model was obtained has nothing in common with the irradiation of a single graphene layer , its structure is amazingly close from those reported by meyer and co - workers @xcite .",
    "looking at this figure , the structural pattern highlighted by the dashed rectangle appeared to be of a particular interest to us . indeed ,",
    "this domain , made of two pentagons , three hexagons ( including a 90@xmath2 rotated one ) and two heptagons , allows for the construction of an entire carbon sheet based on this defect ( see [ defects ] b ) , noted @xmath3 hereafter , as well as for the insertion of a line ( [ defects ] c ) or a point ( [ defects ] d ) defect in graphene .",
    "note that the latter point defect has been very recently observed in a hrtem @xcite .    in what follows",
    ", we report on the structure and properties of different nano - sheets and tubes based on this pattern as obtained from density functional theory ( dft ) and force field calculations .",
    "methodological details are given in section [ methods ] , results are presented and discussed in section [ results ] .",
    "geometry optimization of the @xmath3 unit cell has been achieved using periodic density functional theory calculations .",
    "the vasp package @xcite was used with projector augmented wave pseudopotentials @xcite to describe the valence - ion core interactions , and the perdew - wang - ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation for the exchange - correlation potential @xcite .",
    "atomic positions and lattice parameters were relaxed , and energy criteria of @xmath4 and @xmath5 ev / cell were used for electronic and structural convergences , respectively .",
    "a 15   interlayer distance was kept fixed for all calculations , and up to 450-point 2d grids were used for brillouin zone sampling .",
    "the kinetic energy cutoff for plane - wave expansions was 400 ev .",
    "geometry optimizations of large @xmath3 planes and tubes were achieved using hybrid monte carlo ( hmc ) simulations @xcite coupled to a simulated annealing approach .",
    "the interaction energy between carbon atoms was described by the reactive airebo potential @xcite after removal of the van der waals terms of this potential .",
    "sheets and tubes were placed in an orthorhombic simulation cell with periodic boundary conditions in all directions .",
    "sheets ( respectively tubes ) were placed on the @xmath6 plane ( resp . along the @xmath7 axis ) of the box and a large dimension ( 500  ) was given to the @xmath7 dimension ( resp . @xmath8 and @xmath9 dimensions ) to ensure the simulation of isolated infinite systems .",
    "two kinds of configuration updates were used ( chosen at random ) in our hmc implementation , allowing for a proper sampling of configurational space in the isothermal - isobaric ( @xmath10 ) ensemble :    * short constant energy molecular dynamics ( md ) trajectories with initial velocities drawn from a maxwell distribution at the suited temperature accepted with the usual canonical hmc acceptance criterion @xcite . * random contraction or dilation of the volume in one dimension of the system ( @xmath8 or @xmath9 for sheets , @xmath7 for tubes ) accepted or rejected with the standard isothermal - isobaric monte - carlo acceptance criterion @xcite    simulations were initiated from the fully planar sheets or fully cylindrical tubes with cell dimensions taken from the corresponding graphene sheets or pristine tubes .",
    "constant @xmath10 hmc simulations of @xmath11 steps were then performed at zero pressure and a given temperature ( note that the position of one carbon atom with respect to the simulation cell was held fixed in order to avoid global translation or rotation of the system ) .",
    "after that , the temperature was scaled by a factor 0.9 and the process repeated until convergence of both potential energy and geometry . in the hmc simulations , the probabilities for md and volume move attempts were respectively of 70 % and 30 % .",
    "the length of the md trajectories ( both in terms of the number of steps and of the timestep length ) as well as the magnitude of the maximum volume change attempt were periodically adjusted to yield acceptance ratios of around 50 % for both kinds of moves .",
    "we used an initial temperature of 500 k and stopped the simulated annealing when the temperature was below @xmath12 , which appeared to be sufficient for a full convergence of geometry and energy .    in the last part of the paper ( see figure 5 ) hmc was not used anymore to cool a system down to 0k but to heat it up , as slowly as possible , to high temperatures . in that case",
    "similar simulations were used except that ( i ) the initial configuration was taken from the previously minimized system at 0 k ; that ( ii ) @xmath13 hmc steps were performed at each temperature and that ( iii ) the target temperature was slowly increased by steps of 10 k.",
    "figure [ leyopt_uc]a shows the unit cell of the @xmath3 as optimized by periodic density functional theory ( dft ) calculations .",
    "no significant deviation from the rectangular lattice and no departure from planarity were found in our dft calculations ; however , this holds for the 14-atoms unit cell of figure [ leyopt_uc]a and does not exclude non - planar configurations in supercells , _",
    "i.e. _ with larger degrees of freedom , as we will see in what follows .",
    "the energy of the optimized structure ( see figure [ leyopt_uc]b ) is only of 227 mev / atom above graphene , making it the lowest energy defect - containing carbon sheet reported so far . to our knowledge , it was formerly the case of hexagonal haeckelite , with an energy of 240 mev / atom above graphene ( note that we compare to those structures as optimized using the same methodology that we applied to the @xmath3 sheet ) .",
    "also , figure [ leyopt_uc]b shows that the potential wells of the three structures are very similar .",
    "we present now the properties of large carbon sheets and nanotubes based on the @xmath3 pattern as obtained from cell and geometry optimizations using hybrid monte carlo @xcite ( hmc ) simulated annealing and the airebo force field @xcite .",
    "figure [ sheets ] shows a front ( a ) and a side ( b ) view of an optimized periodic @xmath3 sheet made of @xmath14 unit cells .",
    "the energy of this sheet , as given by the airebo potential is of @xmath15 ev / atom , @xmath16 mev / atom above graphene as computed with the same potential ( @xmath17 ev / atom ) .",
    "relative energies of the @xmath3 , haeckelite and graphene sheets given by this potential are in fair qualitative agreement with dft calculations ( haeckelite is found at @xmath18 mev / atom above graphene with this potential ) .",
    "however , a major difference is observed between haeckelite and @xmath3 sheets .",
    "indeed , if the geometry optimization of a large haeckelite sheet reveals an almost planar geometry , figures [ sheets]a and [ sheets]b unambigously unravel a wavy structure developing itself along the @xmath19 unit cell direction , the direction of the adjacent hexagons lines in the structure . optimizing the number of unit cells in that direction we found out that the best possible periodicity is four unit cells along the @xmath19 axis , giving rise to an optimal energy of @xmath20 ev / atom .",
    "the line defect of figures [ sheets]c and [ sheets]d is also of particular interest .",
    "first , and even though it is not easy to directly compare the energies of different line defects , it should be of rather low energy as it is made of a remarkably stable pattern ( the @xmath3 ) .",
    "second , while other observed @xcite or predicted @xcite line defects usually induce a curvature of the sheet perpendicularly to the line , figure [ sheets]d clearly shows that the @xmath3 pattern gives a wavy structure to the sheet , along the line defect , in close similarity with the wavy structure developed on the perfect @xmath3 sheet , though attenuated by the large hexagonal domains on both sides .",
    "the point defect of figures [ sheets]e and [ sheets]f also has an excellent energetic stability , but affects only very locally the structure of the sheet .",
    "it is an antisymmetric defect with an inversion center localized on the center of the inverted hexagon .",
    "we recall that this point defect has been very recently imaged by kotakoski _",
    "et al . _ during a hrtem observation of an irradiated graphene layer@xcite .",
    "as already said , the @xmath3 pattern likes curvature .",
    "this should then be a particurlarly stable pattern to build nanotubes with .",
    "in close similarity with pristine , graphene based zigzag ( zz ) and armchair ( ac ) tubes we have built @xmath3  zz and ac tubes by folding @xmath3 ribbons along respectively the @xmath19 and @xmath21 axes of the pattern s unit cell ( see also the caption of figure [ tubes ] ) .",
    "we present now some results of hmc geometry optimizations on zz and ac tubes of different diameters , ranging from @xmath22 to @xmath23  , and with lengths around 9 nm .",
    "figure [ tubes ] present snapshots of the optimized zz9 , ac5 and ac6 tubes .",
    "their diameters , taken as the double of the mean atomic distance from the tube axis , are respectively @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26  .",
    "all these tubes have rather low energies , respectively @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 ev / atom for zz9 , ac5 and ac6 ; and present different morphologies .",
    "all zigzag tubes studied in this work have a `` necklace of pearls '' shape as shown on figures [ tubes]a and [ tubes]d for zz9 , in close similarity with some haeckelite tubes @xcite .",
    "low diameter armchair tubes ( from ac3 to ac5 ) have a fairly cylindrical morphology ( see the snapshots of tube ac5 on figs [ tubes]b and [ tubes]e ) , typical of graphene based tubes .",
    "however , from ac6 ( 14.7  ) to ac12 ( 29.9  ) , armchair tubes develop a pronouced helical morphology ( see the snapshots of tube ac6 tube on figs [ tubes]c and [ tubes]f ) .    on figure [ tubezz ]",
    "we plot the energy of zz tubes as a function of their diameter relatively to the sheet of lowest energy ( -7.135 ev / atom ) .",
    "as expected , the energy per atom , around 40 mev above the @xmath3 sheet for the smallest tube , diminishes with the tube diameter at low diameters thanks to the relaxation of curvature stresses .",
    "however , the behaviour of the curve above 10   is particularly unusual .",
    "first , we can see that zz tubes with diameters in the range [ 12:25  ] , from zz8 to zz13 here , have lower energies than the rippled sheet .",
    "second , the curve goes through a minimum around 15  , with the minimum energy tube found here , zz11 , being 7 mev / atom lower than the sheet .",
    "finally , above 25   diameter , zz18 tube has a positive energy with respect to the sheet .",
    "these results indicate once again the high affinity of the @xmath3 pattern for curvature along the lines of hexagons ( @xmath19 axis ) and tend to show that there exists an optimal curvature for this pattern which corresponds roughly to a 15   diameter zz tube .",
    "figure [ tubeac ] is equivalent to figure [ tubezz ] for armchair tubes .",
    "the first points to note are that ac tubes present higher energies than zz tubes at equivalent diameters and that all the ac tubes studied in this work have higher energies than the lowest rippled sheet . for instance , the most stable ac tube studied in this work , ac10 ( @xmath30 30  ) , is found 20 mev / atom above the sheet . unlike zz tubes , the evolution of ac tubes energy with respect to diameter is monotonically decreasing ; however , a step is observed between the low diameter cylindrical tubes ( ac3 to ac5 ) and the larger helical tubes ( ac6 to ac10 ) .    in order to investigate the thermal stability of the @xmath3 sheet",
    "we now present results of a hmc simulation in which a periodic sheet of 2142 atoms was slowly heated from 0 to 2000 k. the evolution of the energy per atom as a function of temperature is shown on figure [ warmup ] and some snapshots of the system during the heating process are given figure [ warmup_snaps ] .",
    "as can be seen on figure [ warmup ] , the energy evolves rather linearly with temperature at low temperatures and the sheet shows three well defined waves ( see figure [ warmup_snaps]a ) . around 1000 k , a slight drop in the energy increase is observed and the sheet evolves from three low amplitude waves ( figure [ warmup_snaps]a ) to two well - pronounced waves ( figure [ warmup_snaps]b ) .",
    "the energy then keeps on increasing linearly until another drop at around 1400 k. at that point , two parts of the sheet enter into contact and form a regular bridge , containing @xmath31 hybridized atoms , all along the @xmath21 unit cell axis ( figure [ warmup_snaps]c ) .",
    "this is shortly followed by the formation of a second , and symmetric , bridge around 1700 k to form an almost perfect periodic two - dimensional network of interconnected tubes ( figure [ warmup_snaps]d ) .",
    "this rippled nanocarbon obtained at 2000 k , shown on figure [ warmup_snaps]d , has then been optimized by a hmc simulated annealing quench down to 0 k , the latter structure being shown figure [ warmup_snaps]e .",
    "its energy , of @xmath32 ev / atom , is @xmath33 mev / atom below the one of the initial sheet , indicating , once again , the affinity of the @xmath3 pattern for high curvatures .",
    "the diameters of the interconnected tubes forming this porous structure are actually very similar to those of the zz9 tube presented on figures [ tubes]a and [ tubes]d , and correspond to the optimum curvature for zigzag tubes ( see figure [ tubezz ] ) . looking at figure [ warmup_snaps]e , the structure of this carbon immediately reminds of some shock protection materials used in everydays life packaging and",
    "there is no major risk taken in guessing that its mechanical properties would be particularly unusual .",
    "also , it should be regarded as a very interesting adsorbent due to its aligned network of high aspect ratio tubular pores .",
    "figure [ warmup_pores ] shows an enlargement of figure [ warmup_snaps]d , to unravel the porous nature and accessibility of this new form of carbon .",
    "as can be seen on this figure , those pores are extremely easy to access , thanks to numerous windows all along the structure , probably facilitating any adsorption / desorption process with respect to other cnt based adsorbents .",
    "finally , it is interesting to note , as illustrated on the top of figure [ warmup ] , that the same heating simulation on haeckelite shows a perfectly linear evolution of energy with temperature which corresponds to a perfect conservation of the sheet structure ( not shown ) , aside from thermal vibrations .",
    "we have proposed new rippled carbon planes and tubes based on a new structural pattern , the @xmath3 pattern , recently observed in some atomistic models of pyrocarbons .",
    "these structures can be either entirely made of this pattern or inserted as line or point defects in graphene or graphene - based tubes .",
    "both dft and force field energy minimisations show that structures built from this pattern have low energies ( actually , the lowest energies reported so far ) for structures with a high density of non - hexagonal rings .",
    "another evidence of the high stability associated to this pattern is that the point defect of figures [ sheets]e and [ sheets]f has been recently imaged in a tem @xcite .",
    "structures based on the @xmath3 pattern love curvature and show rather unusual properties : ( i ) sheets have a pronounced wavy structure ; ( ii ) line defects develop a parallel wavy structure ; ( iii ) tubes may show lower energies than sheets ; and ( iv ) , sheets are able to close themselves under heat treatment to form a 2d ordered nanoporous carbon .",
    "finally , the highest surprise stemming from this defect type maybe lies in its electronic properties .",
    "indeed , it is now a common thought that pentagon and heptagon containing carbon structures are metallic @xcite . as can be seen on the density of states plot of figure [ dos ] , and despite its high density of pentagons and heptagons , the @xmath3 network is semi - metallic , alike graphene ( although its dos has more features than the one of graphene due to its lower symmetry and the more complex connectivity path of its carbon network ) .",
