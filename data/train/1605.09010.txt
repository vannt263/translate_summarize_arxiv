    "rate controlled queueing systems commonly arise from applications in communication systems , see e.g.  @xcite and references therein . recently ,",
    "they have also been considered in modeling limit order books , see e.g.   @xcite . a common approach to the study of such rate control problems when the system is in heavy traffic",
    "is through diffusion approximations . in a problem setting where there is interaction between servers / queues in that the rates associated with a particular queue and server can depend on the states of the other queues ,",
    "this approach leads to a stochastic control problem for @xmath0-dimensional reflected diffusions , where @xmath0 is the number of queues in the system .",
    "when @xmath0 is large such control problems are computationally intractable and in general this ` curse of dimensionality ' is unavoidable .",
    "however , when there are certain symmetries present and the interaction between queues is weak , in that each queue has @xmath1 affect on any other queue in the system , a natural approach is to consider , in addition to heavy traffic , another asymptotic regime where the number of queues @xmath0 approaches @xmath2 as well .",
    "such model settings arise in many applications , e.g. , cloud computing , live streaming , limit order books , customer service systems , etc . in many of these contexts the servers are strategic , for example , in customer service networks , servers respond to workload incentives ( see @xcite ) , and in the context of limit order books buyers and sellers place their orders in a strategic manner and interact weakly through their impact on the price distribution .",
    "we study one of the simplest forms of queuing networks , namely a collection of @xmath0 single server queues .",
    "the system is assumed to be _ critically loaded_. that is , for each queue , the traffic intensity , which is the ratio between the rate of arrivals to the rate of service is @xmath3 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the arrival and service rates for each queue are @xmath4 . in absence of control and state dependence of rates",
    ", the analysis simply reduces to that of a single @xmath5 queue which in the heavy traffic can be approximated by a one dimensional reflected brownian motion . in the setting we consider , every server can exercise control on the arrival and service rates associated with its own queue .",
    "this control which is @xmath6 is of lower order compared to the overall rate but it can have significant impact on performance in the asymptotic regime we consider .",
    "the rates can depend on the state of the individual queue , furthermore a particular queue s state is influenced by the remaining queue states through their empirical measure .",
    "the control action for each server can use information on the history of queue lengths , arrival and processing times and control actions for all the queues in the system . we consider a rate control problem where each server aims to minimize its individual cost .",
    "although many different types of cost criteria can be considered , here for simplicity we consider a cost function over a finite time horizon .",
    "this cost function may depend on the individual queue lengths , the control action , and the empirical measure of all the queue states .",
    "a natural way to formulate optimality for such @xmath0-player games is through the notion of a ( near ) nash equilibrium .",
    "computing nash equilibria , even if one considers the simplified heavy traffic approximation in terms of reflected diffusions , is computationally a very challenging problem when @xmath0 is large .",
    "the goal of this work is to analyze an asymptotic formulation where simultaneously each queue approaches heavy traffic _ and _ the number of queues approaches @xmath2 .",
    "there is extensive literature on heavy traffic limits of rate controlled queuing systems with a fixed number of queues @xcite , however to the best of our knowledge this is the first work to study the asymptotics for controlled queues where in addition to heavy traffic , the number of queues approach infinity as well .",
    "we will show that the asymptotics in this regime is governed by a lasry - lions type mean field game ( mfg ) for reflected diffusions .",
    "we will use the solution of the mfg to construct an asymptotic nash equilibrium for the @xmath0-player queueing system .",
    "this equilibrium has a simple and appealing decentralized structure : each server bases his decision only upon the length of his own queue and a deterministic measure valued function obtained from the solution of the mfg .",
    "we also prove that the value of the above near nash equilibrium converges to the value function of the mfg as @xmath7 .",
    "in general closed form solutions for mfg of the form that arise here are not available and thus one needs numerical approximations . in our work",
    "we study one such procedure that uses the markov chain approximation method ( @xcite ) and establish convergence of the scheme .",
    "the theory of mean field games was initiated a decade ago in the seminal work of lasry and lions @xcite , and huang , malham , and caines @xcite . in recent years",
    "there has been a growing interest in this field . for recent theoretical developments and applications of this theory",
    "see @xcite and references therein .",
    "mean field approximations for weakly interacting stochastic particles have a long history starting from the works of boltzmann , mckean , kac and others ( see @xcite and references therein ) . even in the context of queuing systems and communication networks ,",
    "there have been many works @xcite .",
    "another related branch is agent based models with mean - field interaction ( but without strategic agents ) , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "mfgs have also been used by queuing theorists as a tool in recent years see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to these works we consider an mfg associated with queuing systems in heavy traffic .",
    "we now make some comments on proof techniques . roughly speaking",
    ", solution of an mfg considered here can be viewed as the solution of a fixed point problem on the space of probability measures on certain path spaces ( see section [ sec3 ] ) . in order to characterize such solutions , in a setting where each agent s state evolution is described through a diffusion process ,",
    "lasry and lions @xcite studied wellposedness of two coupled nonlinear partial differential equations ; one is an equation of hamilton - jacobi - bellman ( hjb ) type while the second takes the form of a kolmogorov forward equation .",
    "a somewhat different approach is taken in recent works of carmona , delarue , and lacker @xcite .",
    "using probabilistic methods , authors characterize the mfg solution as a solution to certain forward backward stochastic differential equations .",
    "the paper @xcite is particularly relevant in that it considers a weak formulation of the mfg .",
    "one of our main results is theorem [ thm1 ] which identifies an asymptotic nash equilibrium for the @xmath0-player game as @xmath7 . in order to prove this result ,",
    "the main work is to prove suitable tightness properties and analyze and characterize the weak limit points of certain stochastic processes and random measures . here",
    "we make use of a result from @xcite ( see lemma 4.2 therein ) which can be viewed as an extension of de finetti s theorem for sequences of random measures on certain path spaces . in proving suitable tightness properties of control processes",
    "we consider a relaxed control formulation .",
    "our assumption on the uniqueness of the minimizer ( assumption [ assumption1](b ) ) ensures that extending the class of controls in this manner does not lower the cost .",
    "such relaxed control formulations have been widely used in stochastic control theory , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "more recently , they have also been invoked in the study of mean field games @xcite .",
    "other key ingredients needed for the proof are ( a ) regularity properties of the optimal feedback controls for certain stochastic control problems for reflected diffusions ; ( b ) weak formulation of stochastic control problems for reflected diffusions .",
    "we find that the approach based on hjb characterizations of value functions is particularly well suited for our problem setting .",
    "in particular , regularity results from @xcite for quasilinear pde with neumann boundary conditions give us the required estimates for obtaining the desired properties of the optimal feedback controls .",
    "use of hjb theory in our analysis is a feature that is common to the approach initiated by lasry and lions , however a point of departure is that instead of using kolmogorov forward equations we characterize probability distributions as unique weak solutions of suitable reflected diffusions . in this sense our approach is closer to @xcite although we do not make use of forward backward stochastic differential equations in our work . in the final section of this work we provide a numerical scheme for solving the mfg .",
    "viscosity solution methods for numerical approximations of mfg have been studied in @xcite .",
    "here we consider a probabilistic approach based on a markov chain approximation method @xcite .",
    "the convergence proof once more relies on weak convergence arguments of the form used in the proof of theorem [ thm1 ] . to the best of our knowledge",
    "this is the first work to develop a numerical scheme based on markov chain approximations for an mfg problem .    in summary",
    "our main contributions are as follows .",
    "we    * consider a rate control problem for large symmetric queuing systems in heavy traffic with strategic servers ; * introduce an mfg for controlled reflected diffusions , establish its solvability and prove unique solvability under additional conditions ( theorem [ thm_fixed ] ) ; * use the solution of mfg to construct an asymptotically optimal nash equilibrium for the @xmath0 player game ( theorem [ thm1 ] ) ; * develop a convergent numerical scheme to solve the mfg ( theorem [ thm : thm52 ] ) .",
