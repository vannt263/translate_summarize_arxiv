    "[ p3 ] upper bound for the number of vectors @xcite : + if a complex etf(@xmath9 ) exists then @xmath45 . for the real case @xmath46 .",

    "[ p4 ] integrality conditions for real etf @xcite : + if a real etf(@xmath9 ) exists for @xmath47 , then @xmath48 and @xmath49 are both odd integers .    also , there are further restrictions arising from strongly regular graphs .",

    "indeed , the only disproved case corresponds to the complex etf(@xmath55 ) @xcite .    another interesting concept related to etf , besides the gram matrix , is the _",

[ wkmn ] if a matrix @xmath70 exists , then there exists an integer number @xmath79 such that @xmath80 furthermore , @xmath81 has the same parity as @xmath3 .    we know from proposition [ propkn ] that there exists an integer number @xmath81 such that @xmath82 which means that @xmath80 the parities of @xmath81 and @xmath3 are the same due to proposition [ propkn ] .",

    "although @xmath51 can not be a prime number for real etf , @xmath51 can be the square of a prime .",

    "thus , @xmath83 and from equation ( [ k ] ) we have @xmath219 .    as we mentioned in section [ hkwm ] , the case @xmath83 corresponds to hermitian conference matrices @xmath71 .",

    "some existing cases are @xmath223 , @xmath224 and @xmath225 .",
    "we can easily prove a well - known restriction on the parameters of real etf .",
    "if a real etf consisting of an even number @xmath3 of vectors exists then @xmath198 is an odd number .    from proposition [ nsquares ] we know that @xmath220 .",
    "if @xmath51 is odd then @xmath198 and @xmath226 are odd numbers .",
    "this proposition is equivalent to property [ p4 ] .",
    "it is important to remark that real matrices @xmath70 were studied in the past by seberry and lam @xcite .",
    "the paper contains an implicit table with all the possibly existing matrices @xmath71 for @xmath227 and @xmath228 .",
    "it lists 91 allowed pairs @xmath229 , each of them being potentially equivalent to an etf(@xmath9 ) in the way demonstrated in proposition [ propwkw ] . among those 91 allowed cases , 8",
    "were confirmed to exist by seberry and lam : @xmath230 surprisingly , their work has been overlooked by the community of etf for 34 years .",
    "all the above described cases and some integrality restrictions were independently rediscovered in etf theory .      in section [ hkwm ]",
    "we have demonstrated that in every square dimension @xmath3 the fourier matrix allows a hermitian representation having a constant diagonal and , thus , it determines a 1-weighing matrix for every square number @xmath3 ( see equation ( [ wfourier ] ) ) . as a consequence",
    ", we have the following result .",
    "[ etff ] a complex etf@xmath231 exists for every square number @xmath114 .    even more , from this result we realize that in some particular hilbert spaces there exist a real and an inequivalent complex etf that have the same parameters @xmath9 .",
    "[ rcw ] if a real matrix @xmath87 exists in a square dimension @xmath3 , then there exist a real and a complex etf@xmath231 that are not equivalent to each other .",
    "the first non - trivial example occurs for @xmath232 , where the real and a non - equivalent complex etf(6,16 ) coexist .",
    "a suitable real hadamard matrix can be obtained using the sylvester s construction as a tensor product of real matrices @xmath233 , where @xmath234 are factors of @xmath3 .",
    "the complex matrix @xmath87 is provided by proposition [ wn1 ] .",
    "there is a remarkable property for 1-weighing matrices which does not hold for any other value of @xmath0 : _ the tensor product of 1-weighing matrices is a 1-weighing matrix_. this property lead us to a wide range of inequivalent 1-weighing matrices existing for square dimensions @xmath3 :    [ wtensor ] let @xmath235 be the prime power decomposition of @xmath88 , where @xmath3 is a square and @xmath236 are distinct prime numbers .",
    "then there exist at least @xmath237 inequivalent etf(@xmath238 ) , where @xmath239 denotes the number of unrestricted partitions of the integer number @xmath240 .",
    "furthermore , all these etf are unital .    before giving the proof ,",
    "let us exemplify the meaning of `` unrestricted partition '' .",
    "the number four can be written as a sum of non - negative integer numbers in five different ways : @xmath241 . therefore , @xmath242 .",
    "let @xmath235 be the prime power decomposition of @xmath88 .",
    "therefore , from the hermitian fourier matrices ( [ wfourier ] ) we can construct the 1-weighing matrix of size @xmath3 by considering the tensor product of 1-weighing matrices of sizes @xmath243 for every @xmath244 .",
    "in particular , all possible products of matrices of size @xmath245 generate @xmath246 different matrices which are 1-weighing and have size @xmath247 .",
    "therefore , there are @xmath248 different ways to construct a 1-weighing matrix of size @xmath249 .",
    "furthermore , all of these matrices are inequivalent in the sense that we can not transform one into the other by permuting rows / columns and multiplying rows / columns by unimodular complex numbers .",
    "this is so because the set of invariants under equivalence known as _ haagerup set _",
    "@xcite : @xmath250 is different for all the matrices @xmath71 .",
    "therefore , the etf obtained from them are inequivalent .",
    "proposition [ wtensor ] can be extended to a construction of other etf(@xmath238 ) by considering some existing real 1-weighing ( hadamard ) matrices .",
    "for example , for @xmath251 the real case @xmath252 is not considered in proposition([wtensor ] ) . also , there are further complex cases such as @xmath253 , generated by considering the tensor product of the symmetric hadamard matrix of size 4 and the hermitian fourier matrix of size 36 ; and so on for higher dimensions .",
    "let us consider another special property of etf arising from matrices @xmath87 .",
    "if etf@xmath254 and etf@xmath255 exist , then also etf@xmath256 exists .",
    "the proof relies on the fact that the tensor product of 1-weighing matrices is a 1-weighing matrix .",
    "note that the @xmath257 vectors of the resulting etf are not necessarily the tensor product of the etf having @xmath258 and @xmath259 vectors .",
    "the previous discussion involved the existence of some unital equiangular tight frames .",
    "let us show that for a given number of vectors @xmath3 only a reduced set of @xmath81-th roots of unity are allowed to define a unital etf(@xmath9 ) . to this end",
    ", the link between etf and @xmath0-weighing matrices plays a fundamental role .",
    "[ pvs ] suppose that the off - diagonal entries of a matrix @xmath70 are @xmath81-th roots of unity for a certain @xmath260 and @xmath261 is integer .",
    "also , let @xmath262 be the decomposition of @xmath81 in prime power factors .",
    "then there exist numbers @xmath263 such that @xmath264 where @xmath265 .    without loss of generality we can assume that the first two rows of @xmath71 have the form @xmath266 therefore",
    ", the inner product between these two rows reads @xmath267 it is known that a sum of @xmath268 terms of the form @xmath269 , composed by @xmath81-th roots of unity with @xmath262 , can vanish only if there exists numbers @xmath263 such that @xmath270 , where @xmath271 are prime numbers and @xmath272 @xcite . since @xmath273 , equation ( [ vs ] ) can be understood as a vanishing sum of @xmath274 unimodular numbers .",
    "therefore , a necessary condition for the existence of a unital @xmath0-weighing matrix of size @xmath3 composed by @xmath81-th roots of unity with @xmath262 is the existence of numbers @xmath263 such that @xmath275 .    for example , let us consider @xmath276 and @xmath277 .",
    "equation gives the only possibility @xmath278 , corresponding to @xmath85 ( the trivial solution @xmath279 corresponds to a regular simplex , and is thus excluded ) .",
    "this case determines a sic - povm in dimension @xmath280 , composed by third roots of unity @xcite .",
    "let us consider a further example for @xmath281 and fourth roots of unity .",
    "according to proposition [ pvs ] , for @xmath282 we have @xmath283 .",
    "the only possible solutions @xmath284 for which equation gives an integer @xmath32 are @xmath285 .",
    "they determine etf(32,64 ) , etf(28,64 ) and etf(8,64 ) , respectively .",
    "in particular , the etf(8,64 ) is a special kind of sic - povm known as _ hoggar lines _ @xcite .",
    "symmetric informationally complete povm ( sic - povm ) @xcite correspond to the particular case of etf(@xmath286 ) . typically , the off - diagonal entries of the gram matrix of a sic - povm are unimodular complex numbers but not roots of the unity .",
    "interestingly , proposition [ pvs ] provides an important restriction for the existence of unital sic - povm .",
    "indeed , from equation ( [ 29.5 ] ) we have that if @xmath261 is not an integer number then the sic - povm can not be composed by roots of unity , where @xmath0 is given by equation ( [ k ] ) . by considering @xmath287 in equation ( [ k ] ) we have @xmath288 .",
    "therefore , let us establish the following observation    [ dsics ] a dimension @xmath32 may contain a unital etf if @xmath289 is a square .    up to dimension @xmath290",
    "the only possible unital sic - povm are given for : @xmath291 the firsts three unital etf ( bold ) appearing on the above list are known to exist , corresponding to 4th , 3rd and 4th roots of unity in the off - diagonal entries of the gram matrix of the sic - povm , respectively .",
    "the first open case for unital sic - povm corresponds to @xmath292 .",
    "it worths to mention that etf are rarely known in dimensions @xmath293 but , hovewer , non - unital etf exists for the firsts seven cases mentioned in equation ( [ sics ] ) .",
    "we have introduced the concept of @xmath0-weighing matrices",
    ". that is , hermitian matrices having orthogonal columns and entries taken from the set @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the torus of unimodular complex numbers .",
    "we have proven that a subset of @xmath0-weighing matrices , called @xmath71 matrices , are one - to - one connected with the full set of real and complex equiangular tight frames ( proposition [ propwkw ] ) .",
    "we derived basic properties and restrictions for matrices @xmath71 ( section [ siii ] ) , which perfectly fit with known restrictions for equiangular tight frames ( see section [ siv ] ) .",
    "our formalism revealed that seberry and lam had studied real matrices @xmath71 many years ago .",
    "their work implicitly led to certain integrality restrictions for etf and to eight real etf , results that were independently rediscovered later ( see section [ siva ] ) .",
    "we have found many different classes of real and complex etf@xmath231 for every square @xmath3 and some integrality restrictions for unital equiangular tight frames ( section [ sivb ] ) .",
    "moreover , for some particular even square numbers @xmath3 we found that a real and a non - equivalent complex etf(@xmath231 ) coexist ( see observation [ rcw ] ) .",
    "the above results include a restriction for the existence of some unital symmetric informationally complete positive operator valued measure ( sic - povm ) , which have important applications in quantum physics . in particular , up to dimension 100 the only possible unital sic - povm are for dimensions : @xmath294 .",
    "the first three cases are known to exist and @xmath292 represents the first unital open case .",
    "we remark that non - unital sic - povm exist in dimensions 15 , 24 , 35 and 48 .",

    "find a construction for real or complex matrices @xmath70 for @xmath121 and @xmath122 , i.e. , neither complex conference nor complex hadamard matrices .",

    "2 .   find integrality restrictions for the , a priori , allowed values of @xmath295 , given by proposition [ propwkw ] .",
    "for example , we know that @xmath296 is not possible @xcite . along this work",
    "we have reproduced every integrality restriction existing for real etf and derived new restrictions for complex unital etf .",
    "however , we could not find a single integrality restriction for complex etf in general , which seems to be a much harder problem .",
    "3 .   solve the fickus conjecture : consider the three numbers @xmath32 , @xmath51 and @xmath33 .",
    "an etf(@xmath9 ) exists if and only if one of these numbers divides the product of the other two .",
