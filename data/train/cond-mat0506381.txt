    "the structure and dynamics of grain boundaries in materials are still little understood.@xcite the possible relationships between the mesoscopic features of grain boundaries and their inner microscopic structure at the atomic scale remain unclear .",
    "the energies of some interfaces can be accurately described with continuous theories and topological arguments .",
    "but the study of other quantities ( like mobilities ) , as well as short scale phenomena such as faceting , may require a deeper understanding of the microscopic structure , which directly reflects the discrete and anisotropic character of the lattice . near a boundary , the crystal structure usually has no simple periodic behavior and is therefore difficult to characterize .",
    "any quantitative and sufficiently simple theory allowing a systematic characterization of the fine structure of grain boundaries at zero temperature could open the way toward a general description of these objects .",
    "following such an approach requires to go beyond usual continuous media approximations .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss a way of elucidating grain boundary microscopic structures within a theoretical framework that explicitly takes into account spatial variations at the atomic length scale .",
    "the models considered here have a very small number of parameters .",
    "they derive from very general energy and symmetry arguments .",
    "although the nonlinear approach proposed below is fairly uncommon for crystals , it is largely used in a ( apparently ) completely different field of physics , namely , in pattern formation problems .",
    "many physical systems driven out of equilibrium spontaneously form periodic structures , some of which are characterized by a crystal - like order.@xcite some well - known examples are the cellular structures formed in rayleigh - bnard convection of heated fluid layers , or turing patterns in reaction - diffusion processes .",
    "pattern formation is ubiquitous in nature and has universal features",
    ". some of these features may be of relevance for solid crystals as well .",
    "striking analogies between pattern forming systems and dissipative processes taking place in solid crystals have been recently pointed out.@xcite in section [ sec2 ] , we briefly justify why some simple nonlinear models of pattern formation may be useful to study defects in crystals .",
    "we show in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] that these models are very efficient to capture elementary competition and geometrical exclusion effects that probably take place in genuine grain boundaries .",
    "in particular , they are able to predict interface faceting , a feature still little understood from continuous theories.@xcite the results obtained are in very good agreement with those given independently by a theory of grain boundaries developed recently , which is based on geometrical arguments and inspired from quasicrystals theory.@xcite",
    "we briefly recall some concepts of pattern formation , that can be found in well documented reviews or textbooks.@xcite consider a spatially extended system described by a phenomenological , dimensionless local order parameter @xmath0 depending _ a priori _ on space and time variables . in convection problems , for instance , @xmath0 is related to the vertical velocity at the mid - plane of the convective cell .",
    "a uniform phase is characterized by the trivial solution @xmath1cst(@xmath2 ) .",
    "when a non - trivial stationary periodic pattern sets up in the system , _",
    "e.g. _ above the onset of convection , @xmath3 can be written in a first approximation as a sum of plane waves : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the number of wavevectors ( of same modulus @xmath6 ) characterizing the base pattern ( in two spatial dimensions , @xmath7 for hexagonal symmetry and @xmath8 for square symmetry ) .",
    "a perfect crystal is observed when the amplitudes @xmath9 are all equal to a constant @xmath10 .",
    "the figures [ low ] and [ high ] further show examples of the field @xmath3 in gray scale in 2d ( dark regions have @xmath11 , bright ones @xmath12 ) .",
    "we now look for a simple phenomenological isotropic partial differential equation satisfied by @xmath3 . keeping in mind the analogy with crystals , in addition to the periodicity @xmath13",
    ", one wishes an equation that _ imposes a symmetry _ on the stationary solution ( for instance hexagonal , @xmath7 ) . a linear wave equation like",
    "@xmath14 is not acceptable , as a superposition of any @xmath15 waves would be solution .",
    "instead , we need to resort to a nonlinear equation , introducing a coupling between the different amplitudes @xmath9 in eq.([sum ] ) .",
    "we consider here the well - known swift - hohenberg model ( first introduced in the context of rayleigh - bnard convection ) , which also involve the time variable @xmath16:@xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a dimensionless control parameter , the reduced rayleigh number in convection problems . if @xmath19 in ( [ sh ] ) , @xmath20 is the only stationary solution ( @xmath21 ) that is stable .",
    "the uniform solution @xmath22 becomes unstable for @xmath23 . in that case , new solutions with broken symmetries appear , in the form of a periodic pattern characterized by a layer spacing @xmath24 .",
    "the order parameter @xmath3 can be approximated by a sum of the form ( [ sum ] ) provided that @xmath25 .",
    "nonlinear terms are responsible for mode combinations : given an arbitrary set of wavevectors @xmath26 , one can derive equations for their amplitudes @xmath9 , these amplitudes being now coupled to each other . the @xmath9 s happen to have stable non - zero solutions only in a very small number of cases , that generally correspond to symmetric , crystal - like arrangements of the @xmath26 .",
    "for instance , equation ( [ sh ] ) with @xmath27 leads to stripes formation ( @xmath28 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath29 and @xmath30 only hexagonal solutions are stable.@xcite    let us now point out one of the crucial properties of this type of model : the evolution equation ( [ sh ] ) has a _",
    "potential structure_. one can associate an energy `` , or liapunov functional @xmath31 , to the system , such that eq.([sh ] ) reads @xmath32 ( the right - hand - side representing a functional derivative ) .",
    "@xmath31 is given in that case by @xmath33.\\ ] ] it is easy to show from eq.([sh ] ) that @xmath34 : the quantity @xmath31 always decreases with time .",
    "the dynamics is dissipative and converges toward stationary stable solutions that correspond to _ local minima _ of @xmath31 in the configuration space .",
    "the absolute minimum of @xmath31 corresponds a perfectly regular pattern of the form ( [ sum ] ) , with wavenumber @xmath35 ( a perfect crystal '' ) .",
    "consider now an immobile grain boundary separating two differently oriented domains that are otherwise in the ground state : near the boundary , it is impossible to preserve the regular crystal structure imposed in the bulk . as a consequence , such a configuration must have a higher @xmath31 .",
    "one can now see the pattern formation process given by ( [ sh ] ) from an alternate view - point , very useful for applications to materials : namely , as an _ energy minimization _",
    "problem within some constraints .",
    "stationary grain boundaries can be regarded as optimal solutions of a frustration problem of two competing lattices of different orientations .",
    "the free - energy functional imposes a fixed _",
    "periodicity _ on the field @xmath3 in the bulk , minimizing the term @xmath36 in ( [ f ] ) , as well as a given bulk _ symmetry _ , which is fixed by mode combination through the higher order terms .",
    "the equations for the amplitudes @xmath9 show that the grain boundary is actually an interference pattern between the two crystals , with amplitudes not constant in space and not equal to each other .",
    "different choices of nonlinear terms can lead to different crystal symmetries in the bulk .",
    "adding other cubic or higher order terms in the functional ( [ f ] ) generates new nonlinear terms in eq.([sh ] ) , modifying the relative coupling constants between the different amplitudes @xmath9 in the solution ( [ sum ] ) .",
    "as a consequence , a crystal formerly unstable may become stable .",
    "for instance , a square crystal lattice ( @xmath8 ) can be obtained by choosing:@xcite @xmath37 $ ] , with @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "this free energy gives coefficients that depend on the angle between the wavevectors in the amplitude equations , such that they stabilize solutions with perpendicular wave numbers .",
    "the energy ( [ f ] ) involves a taylor series expansion of an order parameter , as usual in ginzburg - landau descriptions of phase transitions .",
    "this simple form suggests that geometrical frustration in crystalline phases with isotropic interactions is likely to have some universal features .",
    "actually , numerical solutions of equation ( [ sh ] ) , or slight variants of it , are able to reproduce known features of crystals .",
    "the behavior of the energy @xmath31 of grain boundaries as a function of misorientation angle follows a read - shockley law.@xcite in addition , short - range pinning forces act on defects , a phenomenon analogous to the peierls stress in crystals.@xcite    in the following section , we emphasize the close relationships that exist between this pattern formation approach of grain boundaries and some space filling problems under constraints , that have been solved in ref .   by the use of quasi - crystal methods .",
    "we briefly recall the main aspects of this second theory below .",
    "the main distinctive feature of this theory is that it considers interfaces and quasicrystals as a region in space where two or more interpenetrating crystal lattices compete for space .",
    "the final atomic positions are then decided by a modified version of the strip - projection proposed by katz and duneau@xcite to study quasicrystals .",
    "perhaps the most important attribute of this approach is that it allows interfaces and quasicrystals to be described by the same set of equations , thus rendering them formally equivalent .    given a completely arbitrary set of lattices and relative orientations the formalism produces ideal ( minimum local strain ) structures which are expected to play for grain boundaries the same role than the perfect crystal concept plays for crystals , i.e. , they define defect free , reference structures analogous to bravais lattices . since strain minimization is a physical consideration , the formalism is endowed with a physical basis in spite of its geometrical formulation .",
    "full details of this method can be found in ref .  .",
    "briefly , the crystal lattices are embedded in a higher dimensional space where they define an hyper lattice whose symmetry depends on that of the lattices and their relative orientation .",
    "this hyper lattice is then projected back to physical space to produce the actual interfacial structure or quasicrystal .",
    "the higher dimensional @xmath40 space is schematically represented in figure [ hyper ] .",
    "it is divided in two sets of orthogonal @xmath41 subspaces : @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "@xmath44 and @xmath45 contain the lattices @xmath46 and @xmath47 of the two crystals , and @xmath48 contain respectively , the actual interfacial structure and the strain field across the interface .",
    "@xmath49 is actually the bollmann s displacement space or b - space.@xcite    only those hyperpoints contained within a small region around @xmath50 ( see figure [ hyper ] ) called the strip@xcite are projected .",
    "the size of the strip is chosen to include pairs of atoms that occupy incompatible positions , these atoms are then replaced in @xmath50 by a single atom at their average position . given two interpenetrating lattices in physical space , the method constructs an ideal , best fit , minimum strain lattice as the set of points of @xmath50 . by adopting the average position , atoms at the interface act as a strain buffer between the crystals on each side of the interface .",
    "the component in @xmath49 is a measure of the local strain or frustration between two nearly coincident ( overlapping ) atoms from each lattice .",
    "this method allows the construction of a complete bicrystal with the parent crystals separated by a unique , fully 3d structure called the interfacial layer ( il ) , arising from the projection of hyperpoints within the strip .",
    "the role of the il , whose structure is different from that of either crystal is to resolve the positional incompatibilities that occur at the interface . since grain boundaries are usually 2d , a suitable il plane ( or surface )",
    "must be selected in order to model any particular boundary plane , of given relative orientation to the parent crystals .",
    "a bicrystal can then be built by filling the space on either side of the boundary with crystal sites projected from @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "note this approach is unique in that the grain boundary always contains atomic ( il ) sites , which makes it susceptible of crystallographic analysis .",
    "we recall now the definition of the o - lattice , a concept that will be useful in the next section . given two crystal lattices , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and a transformation @xmath53 , such that @xmath54 in the absence of translations , the o - lattice is defined as the set of points @xmath55 that satisfy @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the identity matrix , and @xmath58 @xmath59 geometrically , the o - lattice corresponds to points in space ( not necessarily lattice points ) of minimum strain i.e. , minimum misfit between @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "another interesting property of the o - lattice is that if @xmath60 and @xmath61 with @xmath62 are the base vectors of the reciprocal lattices of @xmath46 and @xmath47 respectively , then @xmath63 with integer @xmath64 this equation establishes a relationship between the o - lattice and the moir pattern formed by the superposition of @xmath46 and @xmath47 .      in this section",
    "we study symmetric tilt grain boundaries in two - dimensional ( @xmath65 ) crystals .",
    "the initial condition @xmath66 in eq.([sh ] ) , or its analogue for square patterns , is made of two crystals rotated by @xmath67 , the interface being directed along the vertical axis ( see ref .   for more details ) .",
    "we introduce an angle @xmath68 that either corresponds to the misorientation angle @xmath67 or to @xmath69 ( for square patterns ) , depending on the orientation of the symmetric boundary plane .",
    "note that @xmath70 and @xmath71 . for each rotation @xmath67",
    ", there are two possible boundary orientations ( with different structure ) that lead to a symmetric interface .",
    "the angle @xmath68 represents the angle formed between two atomic planes that are symmetric with respect to the boundary .",
    "we analyze the stationary ( minimum energy ) fields obtained at large times by solving eq.([sh ] ) numerically , and compare their structures with those given by the method described in sec .",
    "[ david ] .",
    "figure [ low ] displays ( on the right ) a boundary obtained by solving the swift - hohenberg equation for square patterns , with an angle @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is an integer ( 4 in this case ) .",
    "such interfaces are singular@xcite and characterized by a simple repeating pattern , as emphasized by the bright circles .    in the geometrical method ,",
    "any grain boundary structure is a 2d manifold ( a plane , usually ) included in the 3d il .",
    "the most likely manifolds are _ a priori _ the ones that run along directions that maximize the density of il sites . such dense planes must clearly intersect perpendicular il planes along directions that have also a high density of sites . in the particular case of a tilt boundary configuration ,",
    "the planes of the il normal to the tilt boundary constitute the model s prediction for the so called twist boundary .",
    "hence , in the geometrical approach , twist boundaries do provide information about the possible directions that a perpendicular ( tilt ) boundary may run along .",
    "we will hence focus on the structure of twist planes below .",
    "the left part of figure [ low ] shows the twist interface corresponding to the example above , obtained using the approach of sec.[david ] for a cubic lattice .",
    "it is a plane normal to the @xmath74 direction in the cubic @xmath75 twist interface .",
    "as indicated above , this plane is a map of all the possible transverse conformations ( or trajectories ) of a tilt grain boundary between two grains of given misorientation angle .",
    "a particular trajectory is indicated in gray .",
    "large disks represent atomic positions , or interfacial sites .",
    "the short and long arrows indicate the o - lattice ( ol ) and coincidence sites lattice ( csl ) base vectors , respectively .",
    "note that the interface is composed of identical domains centered at o - points ( small dots ) , that are points of zero strain .",
    "atomic domains are separated by a network of primary screw dislocations.@xcite the intersection of these dislocations with the boundary plane is highlighted by a square grid in the figure .",
    "the predicted atomic positions ( grayed dots ) match nearly exactly the ( black ) regions where @xmath3 is maximum in the nonlinear model .",
    "the short horizontal lines on the figure mark the positions of dislocations .",
    "these are edge dislocations , with burger s vectors normal to the boundary line .",
    "a similar remarkable agreement was obtained in every case for a variety of angles @xmath68 chosen arbitrary , in square and hexagonal symmetries .",
    "non - singular interfaces are characterized by more complicated interfacial patterns ( not shown ) .",
    "since elastic strain is minimized near o - points , it is expected that tilt interfaces _ of low angles _",
    "@xmath68 tend to run along directions that follow the o - lattice , preserving this way the structure of the domains around the o - points .",
    "the o - lattice has the same symmetry as the crystal ( see figure [ low ] , left ) , but a distinct period @xmath76 , given by @xmath77 $ ] independently of the symmetry@xcite ( @xmath78 is the period of the crystal ; @xmath79 at low angles ) .",
    "therefore , the grain boundaries separating two symmetric grains along the vertical axis should be located at some discrete @xmath80-positions , separated from each other by @xmath76 ( figure [ low ] , left ) . on the other hand , a weakly nonlinear analysis of eq.([sh ] ) allows the derivation of the law of motion of straight grain boundaries.@xcite it is found analytically that interfaces feel a pinning potential , periodic along the @xmath80-direction .",
    "strikingly , the nonlinear model agrees perfectly with the geometrical construction : the periodicity of the pinning potential is @xmath81 $ ] and coincides with @xmath76 . in the nonlinear model",
    ", the derivation of this formula follows from a solubility condition that imposes particular combinations of the modes @xmath82 .",
    "the result is formally equivalent to the the formula ( [ olperio ] ) above .",
    "the lines going through points of the o - lattice thus correspond to minima of a pinning potential in the nonlinear model .",
    "figure [ high ] ( on the right ) represents a configuration obtained at time @xmath83 from the same nonlinear model , with a _ high _",
    "angle @xmath84 .",
    "the initially straight interface quickly destabilizes into a broken - symmetry phase , characterized by facets of short period .",
    "this faceting instability is not observed for low @xmath68 boundaries , for instance that of @xmath85 , the other symmetric boundary orientation in this bicrystal .",
    "the faceted structure is also visible from the geometrical construction of @xmath50 ( left ) .",
    "in this configuration , a straight tilt grain boundary would run vertically , _",
    "i.e. _ along the diagonal of the domains of best fit of size 3 _ or _ 4 , where the distance between o - points is larger .",
    "in order to keep the structure of these domains anyway , the interface becomes faceted instead .",
    "it runs along the core lines of the screw dislocation network . in this case , the interface is locally aligned with the burgers vectors of the dislocations that compose it . along this line",
    ", a repeating structure of 4 atoms facing 3 atoms of the other grain appears , as correctly reproduced by the nonlinear method .",
    "note that the geometrical map of figure [ high ] ( left ) also contains the structure of symmetric tilt boundaries with the angle @xmath86 .",
    "the direction of these interfaces is now inclined of @xmath87 with respect to the vertical direction in figure [ high ] ( left ) : the most likely trajectories are straight and run along a line of maximum o - point density ( or pinning potential minimum ) , as confirmed by nonlinear calculations ( not shown ) .",
    "if an interface with such an orientation destabilized , it would find it difficult to develop the same chinese hat \" facets as observed for the other orientation @xmath88 .",
    "hence , low @xmath68 grain boundaries are probably less likely to facet . in conclusion ,",
    "when the average orientation of a boundary is not parallel to the o - lattice , the boundary _ may _ become faceted .",
    "preliminary numerical results on the nonlinear model for square patterns show that the faceting instability does not occur for misorientation angles lower than a characteristic value @xmath89 .",
    "this value can be interpreted qualitatively as follows : for @xmath90 , the periodicity of the pinning potential @xmath81 $ ] becomes similar to that of the crystal making it easier for the interface to deform under stress .",
    "the configuration of figure [ high ] ( right ) has a relatively high elastic stress .",
    "after sufficiently long times , it starts to slowly evolve into more complicated patterns , with longer facet lengths in order to relieve the initial stress .",
    "we have presented a theory of crystals based on a local order parameter description and general stability and symmetry principles .",
    "the theory is well suited for the description of short scale phenomena , in particular the intricate spatial distributions of atoms in grain boundaries .",
    "the results compare very well with those given independently by a generic geometrical theory of grain boundaries . the nonlinear nature of the model naturally incorporate some underlying topological structures , such as the o - lattice , which in this theory is interpreted as the set of boundary pinning sites .",
