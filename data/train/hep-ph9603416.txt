    "along with the search for the elusive higgs bosons , efforts continue to be made to experimentally distinguish between the minimal ( standard ) and non - minimal higgs models@xcite .",
    "_ @xcite have provided an interesting approach to deal with this issue by analyzing the gauge - boson scattering signals in hadron supercollider experiments .",
    "they have shown that the relative frequencies of the gauge - boson scattering modes leading to the final states @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 are significantly different in the standard model from those involving other electroweak symmetry breaking mechanisms .",
    "recently , we carried out precise calculations of the @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and higgs - boson scattering amplitudes in the standard model at supercollider energies with the inclusion of the full one - loop radiative corrections , and explored the detection of the higgs boson through gauge - boson scattering in @xmath0 collisions@xcite .",
    "we also emphasized that the apparent violation of unitarity in scattering , encountered by some earlier authors , is not a consequence of the fact that the weak interactions become strong at supercollider energies .",
    "rather , the feynman expansion of the scattering operator yields non - unitary amplitudes at all energies , and the problem becomes accentuated at higher energies .",
    "the unitarity of our amplitudes was ensured by using the k - matrix as well as the pad methods .",
    "we shall now extend our earlier treatment , and use unitarized scattering amplitudes to compute the rates for the various gauge - boson scattering modes in @xmath0 collisions at the lhc energy of @xmath6  tev for @xmath7  gev .",
    "our results for the standard model will be compared with those given by bagger _",
    "in ref .  4 , we calculated the @xmath10-wave amplitudes for the scattering of the @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and higgs - bosons in the coupled neutral channels @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "we have now extended our calculations by including the additional channels @xmath14 and @xmath15 as well as the @xmath16 waves for all the channels . in view of an so(3 )",
    "symmetry associated with the gauge - boson interactions , all amplitudes are expressible in terms of three amplitudes @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 , which are given in ref .  4 .",
    "the @xmath20-wave projection of the amplitude @xmath21 is given by @xcite @xmath22 and let @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 denote similar projections of @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "then , the @xmath20-wave amplitude for the coupled @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 channels can be expressed as @xmath31 and @xmath32 where we have introduced appropriate factors to eliminate the identical - particle restrictions on the @xmath33 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 phase spaces .",
    "the above amplitudes , obtained from feynman s expansion of the scattering operator , require unitarization , and , as explained in ref .  4 , we have used the k - matrix and pad methods for this purpose .",
    "the k - matrix amplitude for the @xmath20th partial wave is given by @xmath34 while the pad amplitude is @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 denote the tree and one - loop amplitudes .",
    "when @xmath38 is a matrix for multichannel scattering , ( [ kmatrix ] ) and ( [ pade ] ) take the forms @xmath39^{-1},\\\\ a^p_l&=&a^{(1)}_l\\left(a^{(1)}_l - a^{(2)}_l\\right)^{-1}a^{(1)}_l.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we have plotted in fig .",
    "1 absolute values of the k - matrix and the pad amplitudes for scatterings among the various gauge - boson channels as functions of the center - of - mass energy @xmath40 for @xmath7  gev .",
    "both the @xmath10- and @xmath16-wave amplitudes are shown , and it may be noted that the @xmath16-wave amplitudes vanish for states containing identical gauge bosons .",
    "the k - matrix and the pad amplitudes agree at lower energies , but the pad amplitudes seem to exhibit an interesting but odd behavior at higher energies . in particular , striking @xmath16-wave resonances in the @xmath11 and",
    "@xmath14 channels appear in the pad amplitudes around @xmath41  gev @xcite .",
    "the physical significance of the pad amplitude resonances has been analyzed in general by atkinson , harada , and sanda@xcite .",
    "we have used the unitarized amplitudes to compute the invariant - mass distributions for gauge - boson pair production via fusion in @xmath0 collisions at the lhc energy of @xmath6  tev for @xmath7  gev .",
    "our calculations are based on the effective - w approximation @xcite , and we have used the same cuts and backgrounds as proposed by bagger _",
    "_ the distributions for production modes leading to the final states @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath43 are shown in fig .  2 .",
    "we have also computed the event rates per lhc - year for gauge - boson fusion signals , assuming @xmath6  tev and an annual luminosity of 100  fb@xmath44 .",
    "our results for the standard model , obtained with the k - matrix and the pad unitarizations , are compared with those of bagger _",
    "_ in table  i. it is interesting that the k - matrix and pad unitarization results are practically the same for all final states despite the appearance of the @xmath16-wave resonances in the channels leading to the @xmath45 and @xmath46 states .    in ref .",
    "3 , it was shown that models for strongly interacting symmetry breaking with a scalar isospin - zero resonance ( standard model , scalar model and o(2n ) model ) will yield a large excess of events in the @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 final states , while models with a heavy isospin - one vector resonance , or no resonance at all , will provide a large enhancement of the @xmath50 final states .",
    "it is the distinguishing features of these models , examined from the perspective of all the various final states , that allows different mechanisms for strongly interacting electroweak symmetry breaking to be recognized .",
    "our standard - model calculations have produced some differences with respect to the previous analysis of the electroweak symmetry breaking sector given in ref .",
    "the results computed here demonstrate an enhancement of the @xmath51 final states , bringing the event rate closer to that of the vector models with a heavier resonance .",
    "although this increase to about 8 events / lhc - year is still smaller than the isovector and nonresonant enhancements computed in ref .",
    "3 , it can still increase the expected time it may take to distinguish these symmetry breaking mechanisms from the standard model by a couple of years .    through the application of both the k - matrix and pad unitarizations , we find some decrease in the event rates for the @xmath11 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 modes .",
    "this does not significantly affect the usefulness of these modes in distinguishing the standard model or o(2n ) models from the other mechanisms of spontaneous symmetry breaking ; there is only an indication that the separation between the chiral lagrangian model with a heavy scalar resonance and the standard model becomes less clear .      since the standard model is the most popular and economical of all the models , it is desirable to obtain the standard model results as precisely as possible .",
    "our theoretical results will be useful in the search for the higgs bosons at supercollider energies as well as for experimentally distinguishing the standard model from non - minimal higgs models .",
