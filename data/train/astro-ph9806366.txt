    "the purpose of this paper is to make available to the community the stellar catalog from the deep multicolor survey ( dms ) and the results we have obtained from follow - up spectroscopic observations of 234 objects in the catalog .",
    "the main objective of the dms has been to search for fainter quasars at high redshift , @xmath6 , and at lower redshift , @xmath7 , than had been covered before with multicolor images and a digital detector .",
    "in addition , the survey is useful for the study of faint field galaxies and of faint stars at high galactic latitude .",
    "the survey is described in three papers : @xcite ( paper i ) , @xcite ( paper ii ) , and @xcite ( paper iii ) .",
    "paper i describes the survey fields and multicolor imaging data that were obtained with a 2048@xmath82048 ccd camera on the kitt peak national observatory 4-m mayall telescope .",
    "it also covers the data reduction steps ; the detection , classification , and cataloging of objects ; and the photometric measurements and their error estimates .",
    "paper ii covers the different multicolor techniques we used to select quasar candidates in the survey , the initial spectroscopic observations that we made with the hydra multifiber spectrograph , and the results we obtained for quasars and other objects in the survey .",
    "paper iii describes additional spectroscopic observations we made of quasar candidates in the survey and summarizes the results we have to date .    in this paper",
    "we summarize in  2 the main properties of the survey .",
    "we describe in  3 the catalog of 19,494 stellar objects that we are making available in electronic form .",
    "we review how quasar candidates were selected and the results of the follow - up spectroscopic observations .",
    "we also present in tabular form the lists of quasars and compact narrow emission - line galaxies that we have confirmed so far .",
    "in addition , we give the results for stars that were identified from the spectroscopic observations .",
    "illustrations of the spectra of all the objects are available electronically .",
    "one purpose in making these data available is to aid others carrying out or planning new multicolor surveys .",
    "for example , the data constitute a valuable test or training set for new selection methods for different kinds of objects .",
    "another purpose is to enable studies of the objects in the catalog by all interested researchers .",
    "the survey is based on ccd imaging with the mayall 4-m telescope of six fields covering 0.83 deg@xmath1 of sky at high galactic latitude . the survey employed six filters : @xmath9 and reached 5@xmath10 limiting magnitudes of 22.1 to 23.8 .",
    "we used _ focas _ ( valdes 1982 ) to detect and classify objects in the ccd images .",
    "we found approximately 30,000 objects in total , of which about half are galaxies .",
    "for the purposes of our work we defined stellar objects as those which were detected in three or more filters and classified as stellar in half or more of those filters .",
    "we adopted this approach because we did not want to exclude active galactic nuclei ( agns ) with barely detectable extensions from their host galaxies .",
    "we chose to accept the price of greater contamination of the stellar catalog by galaxies than a more strict requirement would produce .",
    "however , we modeled the selection effects to estimate the number of contaminating galaxies in the final catalog .",
    "the result of our classification is a catalog of 19,494 stellar objects .",
    "this is 9% lower than the 21,375 objects quoted in paper i due to a coding error which allowed into the final catalog objects not meeting our stellar classification criteria .",
    "this error did not affect paper i s completeness estimates for stars significantly , but did cause an overestimate of the galaxy contamination .",
    "we now estimate the catalog s overall contamination rate to be 36.5% ( 7126 objects ) , with roughly half of the contaminants fainter than the 5  @xmath10 limits , as before .",
    "we emphasize that the contamination is expected to be @xmath520% at the final catalog s 5  @xmath10 limits .",
    "consult paper i for more detailed information on these issues .    to illustrate some of the basic properties of the survey",
    ", we show in figure 1 the observed differential source counts for the stellar objects in three different filters : _",
    "b , v , _ and _ r@xmath0_. note that the magnitudes at which the different counts reach a peak ( and decline rapidly toward fainter magnitudes ) agree well with the @xmath2 and 90% completeness magnitude of table 3 in paper i. for reference , we show in figure 2 the cumulative source counts for the same three filters .    a color - magnitude diagram offers a way to visualize other properties of the catalog . we show in figure 3 a @xmath11 diagram for the stellar objects in the catalog , which are mostly stars .",
    "the diagram shows that the bulk of the objects have @xmath12 . the variation in number density with color at constant _ v _",
    "magnitude is a result of both the stellar luminosity function and the fact that for cooler stars , @xmath13 changes less as the temperature decreases , producing an apparent piling up of stars toward @xmath14 .",
    "the diagonal cutoffs and lines at the lower end of the diagram show 1 ) the different limits in the different individual fields of the survey and 2 ) that the redder objects drop below the limiting magnitude of the @xmath4 band at successively brighter @xmath15 magnitudes as @xmath13 increases .",
    "here we describe the contents and properties of the catalog .",
    "we also present information about all the quasars , compact narrow emission - line galaxies , and stars we could identify from follow - up spectroscopy .",
    "the catalog itself is available through the dms home page at http://www.astronomy.ohio - state.edu/@xmath5posmer / dms/. the stellar catalog contains the identification code , position on the sky , x and y coordinates on the image , and the photometric magnitudes and error estimates for all six filters .",
    "the positional uncertainties are estimated to be 0.5 .",
    "note that the identification code consists of the field identifier , according to the nomenclature of table 1 of paper 1 plus a running number for the object .",
    "we have also provided for each object the focas classification codes ( star , galaxy , diffuse , etc . ) for each image and filter .",
    "the classification codes may be useful for different approaches to separating stars and galaxies in the catalog .",
    "the photometric error estimates are important for many quantitative uses of the catalog .",
    "see   4.4 , 4.5 , and 5.4 of paper i for a detailed description of our photometric procedure , limiting magnitudes , and the error analysis . in brief",
    ", we verified that the iraf phot task gave accurate error estimates for our data , and we used phot to produce the individual error estimates listed in the catalog .",
    "note that the error estimates incorporate the cases for objects being fainter than the @xmath16 limits in some of the individual frames (  4.5 of paper i ) .",
    "an error of 0.333 means that the magnitude value corresponds to the @xmath16 limit for that object .",
    "also , a negative value of 0.333 means that the object should have been but was not detected in one of the frames and thus the measurement is being flagged as potentially subject to a non - statistical error .",
    "as discussed in paper ii , quasar candidates for follow - up spectroscopy were selected as outliers in six - dimensional magnitude space and as outliers in different two - color diagrams designed to be most sensitive to quasars with @xmath7 and @xmath6 .",
    "consult paper ii for details on the selection criteria and results of modeling the detection efficiency as a function of magnitude and redshift .",
    "note also that there were errors in the printing of some of the figures in paper ii , which were reprinted correctly in a subsequent erratum ( @xcite 1996c ) .      for reference and to provide a compilation in one place , we list in table 1 information on all 55 of the spectroscopically identified quasars we have found to date in the dms .",
    "the table contains both coordinate and catalog identification numbers and the derived redshift along with the magnitudes and error estimates in each filter .",
    "additional information on individual objects is given in papers ii and iii .",
    "in table 2 we provide information on compact narrow emission - line galaxies ( cnelgs ) in identical format to that of table 1 .",
    "note that there are two entries for n2139 - 0400 because it falls in the overlap region of fields 21e and 21w .",
    "additional information on individual objects is in papers ii and iii .",
    "as described above for the quasars , table 2 and the spectra of the cnelgs are available from the dms home page .      in table 3",
    "we summarize the information we have from the spectra of stars that could be identified among the quasar candidates .",
    "we list catalog i.d .",
    "numbers , magnitudes and error estimates for the six filters , and comments on the spectral features or type of the star . as mentioned previously , we supply this information because it may be useful for researchers working on the properties of faint stars at high galactic latitudes or working on plans for new surveys . however , we emphasize that the spectra were generally of rather low signal - to - noise .",
    "therefore , users of this table should be aware that our estimated spectral types are more uncertain than is the norm in stellar research .",
    "finally , table 3 and the spectra of the stars are available on the dms home page .",
    "we would like to thank the kpno mountain staff for their assistance in observing and the kpno tac for their allocation of time for this project .",
    "we thank jeannette barnes and frank valdes for invaluable assistance with iraf and focas during the course of the survey .",
    "we are grateful to the referee , gregory aldering , for his suggestion about including the classification codes in the catalog .",
    "this not only caused us to find an error in our original computer code but should make the catalog more useful to the community .",
    "this work was supported in part by nsf award ast-9529324 ."
