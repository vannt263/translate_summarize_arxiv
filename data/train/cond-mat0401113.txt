    "spintronics is an active field which studies processes that manipulate the spin degree - of - freedom of electrons , with the goal of developing new electronic devices with improved performance and new functionality compared to the traditional ones which are based on precise control of the charge distribution of electrons.@xcite understanding spin dephasing is an important prerequisite for the realization of such devices .",
    "as most of the semiconductor electronic devices are very small and even a small applied voltage gives a strong electric field , these devices usually work in the hot - electron condition.@xcite therefore understanding spin dephasing in the presence of a strong electric field is of particular importance to the spintronic application .",
    "recent experiments have shown that the electron spin lifetime is very long in @xmath0-type zinc - blende semiconductors.@xcite in theory the spin dephasing in semiconductors without high electric field has been extensively studied .",
    "three spin dephasing mechanisms have been proposed:@xcite the ellit - yaffet mechanism@xcite which is important in the narrow - bandgap and/or high impurity - doped semiconductors ; the bir - aronov - pikus mechanism@xcite which is important in the pure or @xmath1-type semiconductors ; and the dyakonov - perel ( dp ) mechanism@xcite which is the main spin - dephasing mechanism in @xmath0-type zinc - blende semiconductors such as gaas and inas .",
    "the dp mechanism originates from the spin - orbit interaction in crystal without the inversion center and results in spin splitting of the conduction band at @xmath2 .",
    "this is equivalent to an effective magnetic field acting on the spin , with its magnitude and orientation depending on the electron wavevector .",
    "moreover , an important many - body spin dephasing mechanism due to combined effects of the inhomogeneous broadening of the spin precession and the spin conserving scattering by irreversibly disrupting the phases between spin dipoles has been proposed recently@xcite and closely studied.@xcite    the study of the effect of electric fields on electron spins in semiconductors just begins .",
    "experiments have shown that the spin polarization is not destroyed by the strong applied electric field in transport up to a few kv / cm.@xcite it is revealed that under right configurations the electric field can drive the electrons to approach a larger spin injection length . in ref . , the spin dephasing in quantum wires under high electric field is studied through monte - carlo simulation .",
    "the electric manipulation of the spin of two - dimensional ( 2d ) electrons through the rashba@xcite spin - orbital interactions using the in - plane ac electric field has also been proposed.@xcite nonetheless how the hot electron effect affects the spin dephasing / transport is so far not fully investigated .",
    "a complete understanding of the hot - electron effect on the spin dephasing in @xmath0-type gaas quantum wells ( qw s ) can be obtained by solving the many - body kinetic bloch equations@xcite which have been applied successfully to studying the spin dephasing@xcite and spin transport recently.@xcite    in this paper , we use the many - body kinetic equations to study the effect of the high electric field on the spin dephasing .",
    "the paper is organized as following : in sec .  ii we present the model and construct the kinetic bloch equations .",
    "then we show the effect of the electric field on the spin dephasing problem by numerically solving the kinetic equations . in sec .",
    "iii(a ) we first discuss how the electric field affects the spin precession .",

    "we start our investigation of an @xmath0-type ( 100 ) gaas qw of width @xmath3 with its growth direction along the @xmath4-axis . an uniform electric field @xmath5 and a moderate magnetic field @xmath6 are applied along the @xmath7-axis ( vogit configuration ) . due to the confinement of the qw ,",
    "the momentum along the @xmath4-axis of electrons is quantized",
    ". therefore the electrons are characterized by a subband index @xmath0 and a two - dimensional momentum @xmath8 , together with a spin index @xmath9 . for simplicity",
    ", we only consider the wells of a small width so that the separation of the subband energy is large enough and therefore only the lowest subband is populated and the transition to the upper subbands is unimportant .",
    "it is noted that due to the so called `` runaway '' effect , the single subband model is valid only when the electric field is less than a few kv / cm.@xcite this is because when the electric field is above the threshold value , electrons gain energy from the field faster than they can dissipate it by emitting phonons and therefore the transition to upper subbands becomes significant .",
    "consequently in the present paper we only study the case with the electric field up to 1  kv / cm which is sufficiently large to produce the hot - electron effect .    for @xmath0-type samples , spin",

    "[ fig : tempo ] we plot a typical temporal evolution of the electron densities of spin up and down for a gaas qw with initial spin polarization @xmath66  % under two electric fields @xmath67  kv / cm and @xmath68  kv / cm at @xmath69  k. @xmath70  t for both cases . the corresponding incoherently summed spin coherence is also plotted in the figure .",
    "one can see from the figure that , the temporal evolutions of the electron densities and the spin coherence are similar to those in the absence of the applied electric field.@xcite the electron densities and the spin coherence oscillate as electron spins undergo the larmor precession around the total ( effective ) magnetic field . due to the spin dephasing , the amplitude of the oscillation decays exponentially .",
    "an interesting effect of the high in - plane electric field on the spin precession is that there is marked difference in the precession frequency under different electric fields ( even the electric fields of the same magnitude but in the opposite directions ) . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tempo ] , although there is almost no difference in the corresponding spin dephasing rates , the periods of the oscillations are @xmath71  ps and @xmath72  ps for applied electric field @xmath68  kv / cm and @xmath73  kv / cm respectively .",
    "both periods deviate from @xmath74  ps , which is the electric - field - free one of the larmor precession under the magnetic field @xmath70  t.    moreover , it is expected that _ at very low _ temperature ( _ i.e. _ , a few kelvin ) where the momentum collision rate is small , the dp term can result in a rapidly damped oscillations in the spin signal when @xmath75 . at higher temperatures , due to the higher collision rates",

    "it is seen from the figure that eq .",
    "( [ eq : bdp ] ) gives a reasonable estimation of @xmath80 .",
    "in addition to affecting the spin precession frequency , the applied high electric field also changes the spin dephasing time ( sdt ) , _ i.e. _ the inverse of the spin dephasing rate , although the electric field does not couple to the electron spin directly . in fig .",

    "it is seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : taue](a ) that for the impurity - free sample , the sdt first increases with the electric field from @xmath93  ps at @xmath81 and then saturates to @xmath94  ps , @xmath95  % higher when @xmath90 approaches to 1  kv / cm . for samples with impurities",
    ", the sdt also increases with the electric field but with decreased increase rates for higher impurity densities .",
    "when the impurity density rises to @xmath96 , @xmath97 first increases for small electric field and then decreases when the electric field is higher than @xmath98  kv / cm .",
    "moreover the change of the sdt with the electric field is much smaller than that of the impurity - free sample .",
    "the electric field dependence of the sdt varies as the background temperature changes .",
    "when the temperature is raised to a relatively high one , say @xmath92  k in fig .",
    "[ fig : taue](b ) , the sdt increases slightly with the electric field and then decreases when @xmath99  kv / cm even for the impurity - free sample .",
    "the electric field dependence of the sdt is understood due to the concurrent effects of the high electric field and the dp term .",
    "the most obvious effect of the electric field is that the electrons get a center - of - mass drift velocity and the center of the distribution functions drift away from @xmath100 .",
    "one consequence of the drift is that the dp term gives a net effective magnetic filed as discussed above .",
    "this field is moderate and hence has little effect on the sdt .",
    "another one is that because more electrons are distributed at large momentum region , the contribution from the dp term with large momentum is enhanced and the sdt can be reduced .",
    "nevertheless , in addition to the drift , the high electric field also has another counter effect : as the high electric field gives the hot - electron effect with the electron temperature @xmath57 higher than @xmath46 , the scattering is strengthened .",
    "this can enhance the sdt.@xcite in short , the drift of the center - of - mass in the momentum space trends to reduce the sdt while the hot - electron effect helps to enhance it in the regime of our study .",
    "with these two effects considered , the electric field dependence of the sdt can be understood .",
    "when the electric field is small , its effect on the dp term due to the drift is marginal .",
    "therefore the sdt increases with the electric field due to the hot - electron effect when the temperature @xmath46 is relatively low . as the electric field increases ,",
    "the effect of the drift becomes important and the sdt saturates consequently .",
    "it is noted that the hot - electron effect is more pronounced for the system with smaller impurity density under a given electric field.@xcite as a result , the sdt increases slower with the electric field when the impurity density is higher . for high impurity - doped samples ,",
    "the hot - electron effect is markedly smaller than that of the pure ones , therefore the sdt only increases slightly in the low electric field region and then decreases as the effect of the drift dominates .",
    "moreover , when the lattice temperature @xmath46 increases , the hot - electron effect is also reduced .",
    "therefore , in high temperature regime the drift effect becomes important even for low electric fields and it becomes possible that the sdt may drop with the increase of the electric field even for the impurity - free qw s .",
    "moreover , the change in @xmath97-@xmath90 curve at high temperatures is smaller than that at low temperatures as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : taue ] .",
    "it is noted that the electric - field dependence of @xmath97 we obtain is different from that of quantum wires where the sdt decreases with the electric field.@xcite this difference may come from the different contributions of drift and hot - electron effect in quantum wells and quantum wires . in quantum wires as the electrons are much easier to be accelerated by the electric field to higher momentum states .",
    "therefore the drift effect is more pronounced and it is possible that the sdt is reduced by the electric field . while the competing effect of the drift and the hot - electron in the qw results in a more complicated dependence of the sdt on the electric field .    in order to further elucidate the effect of the high electric field to the sdt , we replot the the sdt as a function of the electron temperature @xmath57 with @xmath69  k for @xmath101 and @xmath102 in fig .",
    "[ fig : taut ] .",
    "it is seen that the sdt increases with the the electron temperature @xmath57 , similar to the electric - field - free case where the sdt increases with the temperature.@xcite the figure also shows that the impurities reduce the hot - electron effect and increase the sdt .",
    "these results indicate that for the electric fields we study , the electric field dependence of the sdt is affected mainly by the hot - electron effect in stead of the drift effect .",
    "we now turn to study the effect of the electric field on the spin dephasing with high initial spin polarization . similar problem _ in the absence _ of electric fields has been studied in our previous work.@xcite    the numerical results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : taup ] where the sdt is plotted as a function of the initial spin polarization under different electric fields .",
    "it is seen from the figure that for all the electric fields we study , the sdt increases with the spin polarization as the case of @xmath81.@xcite however the speed drops with the increase of the electric field .",
    "it is interesting to see that the electric field dependence of the sdt is quite different for different initial spin polarizations . in low polarization regime ,",
    "the sdt increases with the electric field while in high polarization one , it decreases with the electric field . for moderate",
    "spin polarized electrons , the sdt is insensitive to the electric field .",
    "the rise of the sdt with the initial spin polarization is understood due to the effective magnetic field from the hf term . as one component of this effective field",
    "is along the @xmath4-axis , it removes the `` detuning '' of the spin flip between the spin - up and -down bands and consequently suppresses the spin precession around the magnetic field and greatly reduces the spin dephasing.@xcite therefore , all the factors , such as magnetic field , temperature , impurity , electron density , and applied electric field which can change the hf term , affect the spin dephasing in the high spin polarization case dramatically .",
    "these factors except the one of the electric field have been discussed in detail in our previous work.@xcite as for the factor of the applied high electric field , both the drift and the hot - electron effects affect the hf term .",
    "the drift of the center of the mass in momentum space provides two competing effects on the hf term : one is to enhance the hf term through the net effective magnetic field @xmath80 discussed above . the other is to destroy the hf term by increasing the dp effect",
    ". meanwhile the hot - electron effect tends to soften the hf term through the increase of the electron temperature and the scattering rate .",
    "our results indicate that the electric field tends to reduce the effective magnetic field from the hf term in high spin polarization regime and consequently reduce the sdt .",
    "in conclusion , we have performed a systematic investigation of the spin dephasing due to the dp mechanism in the present of high electric fields by constructing a set of kinetic bloch equations for @xmath0-type semiconductor qw s based on the non - equilibrium green function method with gradient expansion . in our theory , we include the in - plane electric field , the magnetic field in the vogit configuration , the dp spin - orbital coupling and all the spin conserving scattering such as electron - phonon , electron - non - magnetic impurity as well as the electron - electron scattering . by numerically solving the kinetic equations ,",
    "we study the evolution of electron distribution functions and the spin coherence of spin polarized electrons .",
    "the sdt is calculated from the slope of the incoherently summed spin coherence . in this way , we are able to study in detail how the spin precession and the spin dephasing are affected by the electric field in various conditions , such as the impurity , temperature , and spin polarization .",
    "the in - plane electric field has two competing effects on electron spins .",
    "the most obvious one is that the electrons get a center - of - mass drift velocity and the center of the distribution functions drifts away from @xmath100 .",
    "one consequence of the drift is that the dp term contributes a non - vanishing net effective magnetic field which changes the period of the spin precession .",
    "the larger the electric filed is , the larger the drift velocity and consequently the net effective magnetic field is .",
    "for the electric fields we study , the net effective magnetic field is up to the order of 1  t. this moderate magnetic field has marginal effect on the sdt although it results in a distinct change in the spin precession period .",
    "another consequence of the drift is that because more electrons are distributed at large momentum regime , the contribution of the dp term with large momentum is enhanced .",
    "therefore the drift can reduce the sdt . in additional to the drift , the high electric field also introduces another counter effect on the spin dephasing : the scattering , which tends to drive the electrons to the steady state , is enhanced as the hot - electron effect brought by the high electric field with the electron temperature @xmath57 higher than the background one @xmath46 .",
    "that is , the high electric field can also affect the spin dephasing through hot - electron effect . with these two effects of the electric filed on spin dephasing ,",
    "the electric field dependence of the spin dephasing is very rich in detail .    in small spin polarized regime",
    ", the hot - electron effect tends to enhance the sdt as the increase of the scattering rate reduces the inhomogeneous broadening .",
    "therefore in the small electric field regime where the effect of the drift is marginal , the sdt increases with the electric field due to the hot - electron effect . for larger electric field ,",
    "the effect of the drift become stronger .",
    "therefore the sdt saturates under the joint actions of the drift and the hot - electron effect .",
    "when the impurity density or the background temperature @xmath46 increases , the hot - electron effect reduces and the effect of the drift becomes relatively important . as a result , the increase of the sdt with the electric field is reduced .",
    "for some regimes , the sdt decreases with the increase of the electric field when the drift effect dominates .    in the high spin polarized regime where the hf term plays an important role in the spin dephasing , the hot - electron effect tends to reduce the sdt as both the increase of the electron temperature @xmath57 and the increase of scattering reduce the hf term .",
    "therefore , in the high spin polarization regime , the sdt decreases with the increase of the electric field .",

    "mqw was partially supported by china postdoctoral science foundation .",
    "it is stressed that the electron - electron coulomb scattering is of particular significance in this investigation .",
    "it is not only because the coulomb scattering is crucial in the build - up of the hot - electron temperature and the hot - electron distribution functions , but also because it has strong contribution to the spin dephasing with or without the electric field . with the coulomb scattering ,",
    "the electron distribution functions become smoother in the momentum space and electrons distribute more uniform around the drift center as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fk ] .",
    "it is noted that the treatment of the electron - electron scattering in the present paper takes account of the _ full effect _ of the coulomb scattering which is different from our previous work@xcite where the coulomb scattering is evaluated by replacing the distribution functions and the spin coherence in the scattering with the corresponding isotropic averages along the angle . in this way we are able to compute the electron distribution function more accurate under high electric field and to have the hot - electron effect included in our calculation . it is noted that in the absence of the applied electric field , the approximation we used before greatly reduces the cpu time and gives good qualitative results . however , this approximation is not good if one tries to get the results quantitatively .",
    "we further show the importance of the coulomb scattering in the spin dephasing by plotting the sdt as a function of the applied electric field with and without the coulomb scattering in fig .",
    "[ fig : coul ] .",
    "as shown in the figure , for electrons with small spin polarization , the coulomb scattering tends to drive the electrons to the equilibrium state when @xmath81 or the steady state when applied with a finite electric field , and hence greatly reduces the inhomogeneous broadening originated from the dp term . as a result",
    "the coulomb scattering increases the sdt with / without applied electric fields . for the high spin polarized system , as discussed before , the effective magnetic field along the @xmath4-axis from the hf term plays an crucial role in the spin dephasing and the coulomb scattering tends to reduce this effective magnetic field .",
