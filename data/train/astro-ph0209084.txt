    "because of their low metallicities @xcite , dwarf irregular and blue compact galaxies can provide valuable information for a wide variety of astrophysical problems . by comparing the low metal abundances found in dwarf galaxies to abundances found in luminous spirals",
    ", one can infer variations in star formation histories and chemical evolution .",
    "it is possible to use measurements of abundances in h  ii regions in dwarf irregular galaxies to establish limits on yields from stellar and big bang nucleosynthesis @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to characterize the ionizing radiation from ob stars from measurements of emission lines in h  ii region spectra without resolving individual stellar spectra @xcite .",
    "heavy elements such as c , n , o , ne , s , and ar are typically observed in h  ii regions . in order for accurate abundances to be determined , it is necessary to observe all of the ionization stages present in an h  ii region , or to have a reliable method for inferring the contribution of unobserved ions . of the aforementioned elements , oxygen is the only one for which all important ionization stages can be easily observed at optical wavelengths . in the case of sulfur ,",
    "the primary optical lines are [ s  ii ] @xmath66717,6731 and [ s  iii ] @xmath76312 .",
    "however , the [ s  iii ] @xmath76312 line is an extremely weak and temperature sensitive line , making it difficult to measure in many h  ii regions . because a significant fraction of the sulfur in an h  ii region is in the ionization state s@xmath8 @xcite , accurate determination of s / h = n(s)/n(h ) can be difficult based on optical measurements alone .",
    "the [ s  iii ] @xmath69069,9532 lines in the near - infrared , which are intrinsically much stronger , often require a correction for atmospheric water absorption . in high - ionization nebulae s@xmath3 , which emits only in the 10.5@xmath2 m line , can also become an important constituent .    furthermore , the depth of particular ionization zones , temperature fluctuations ( @xmath9 ) , and other variations throughout a nebula can cause optical / uv forbidden line diagnostics to yield temperatures that are larger than ion - weighted average values in photoionization models , and they can weight emissivities toward values found in higher temperature regions of the nebulae @xcite .",
    "these potential problems motivate the use of temperature insensitive mid- and far - infrared forbidden fine structure transitions in order to include optically unobserved ions , accurately determine nebular abundances , and to determine the amplitude and scale of temperature fluctuations inside h  ii regions ( e.g. , dinerstein , lester & werner 1985 ) .",
    "the infrared portion of the spectrum contains strong emission lines such as [ s  iii ] 18.7@xmath2 m and [ s  iv ] 10.5@xmath2 m . for faint extragalactic h ii regions ,",
    "the high background flux from earth s atmosphere precludes ground - based observations of many middle- and far - infrared emission lines at the present time .",
    "however , the low background and high sensitivity of the iso observatory allowed observations to be made of many faint extragalactic sources .    in this paper , we present mid - infrared @xmath0 spectra of the [ s  iii ] 18.7 @xmath2 m and 33.5 @xmath2 m lines , plus the [ s  iv ] 10.5 @xmath2 m line , from the h  ii region hubble  v in ngc  6822 ( hereafter referred to as hubble  v ) , and the blue compact galaxy i  zw  36 ( mrk  209 ; ugca  281 ) .",
    "our goal is to compare our infrared observations with published optical observations in order to test whether the theoretically predicted ionization correction factors are correct and to determine whether temperature fluctuations are large enough to be detectable in this manner .",
    "observations of hubble  v and i  zw  36 were obtained using the short wavelength spectrometer ( sws ) @xcite on the 60 cm infrared space observatory ( @xmath0 ) @xcite .",
    "details of these observations are given in table 1 .",
    "the astronomical observation template ( aot ) aot02 was used to measure individual lines in a narrow bandpass with a width of @xmath10/@xmath7 @xmath11 0.01 @xcite .",
    "although line profiles were oversampled with the sws , the instrumental profile fwhm of about 150 km s@xmath12 is much larger than the intrinsic widths of emission lines from h  ii regions .",
    "the br@xmath1 and [ s  iv ] 10.5@xmath2 m lines were observed through a 14@xmath13@xmath1420@xmath13 aperture , while the [ s  iii ] 18.7@xmath2 m line was measured through a 14@xmath13@xmath1427@xmath13 aperture .",
    "we also obtained measurements of [ s  iii ] 33.5@xmath2 m through a 20@xmath13@xmath1433@xmath13 aperture , but these observations had poor signal / noise and were not used .",
    "standard @xmath0 reduction techniques were employed to reduce the data , using the latest photometric calibrations and procedures ( sws ia3 ) available at the time of the data reduction @xcite .",
    "the following paragraphs illustrate some of the difficulties and challenges involved in the reduction of the @xmath0 data .",
    "each @xmath0 observation begins with a photometric check , which is a detector scan of an internal calibration source .",
    "this is followed by a series of dark current scans and integrations on the source .",
    "memory effects , fringing , glitches and floating dark current levels seriously degraded the quality of the data that were obtained with the sws .",
    "each of these problems were evident upon preliminary review of the data .",
    "therefore , it was necessary to work with staff scientists and programmers at ipac to correct the data by using the interactive analysis packages that have been developed .",
    "the memory effects were primarily due to the measurement of the internal calibration sources at the beginning of each observation .",
    "the intensity of the calibrators was high enough to cause the detectors to produce artificially high readings while performing subsequent dark scans and observations .",
    "this latent signal that persisted after illumination by bright sources was primarily evident in detector bands 1 and 2 . during the interactive analysis ,",
    "memory effects were corrected first , using the _ antimem _ idl routine that was designed specifically for this purpose .",
    "the second effect that we corrected for was the variation in dark current readings . at regular intervals",
    "while observing an object , the detector would perform a dark current scan . because of time - dependent and nonlinear detector response effects ( e.g. , memory effects , changing noise levels , and `` glitches '' ) , dark current subtractions by the automated processing pipeline were often inaccurate , especially for very faint continuum sources .",
    "the dark scans were corrected by hand using the _",
    "dark_inter _ algorithm .",
    "first , each individual dark scan was sigma clipped about the median of the scan using a threshold of @xmath15 . in severe cases ,",
    "entire dark scans were thrown out ( especially dark scans that suffered from memory effects because they immediately followed a photometric check ) .",
    "individual scans were also deglitched , as will be discussed later . while making the dark current corrections , it was necessary to determine whether the dark current level , which appeared to jump at random time intervals , actually correlated with the subsequent object scan . in cases where there was bimodality , in which the voltage readout fluctuated between two levels from one readout point to the next on very short timescales , only those points which corresponded to the dark level of the object scans were used .",
    "use of these corrected dark levels resulted in a marked improvement of the quality of dark subtraction .",
    "variations in sensitivity were also a problem in the @xmath0 detectors @xcite . generally , these variations were time - dependent and nonlinear .",
    "variations from orbit to orbit were often caused by passage through the van allen radiation belts , cosmic ray strikes and observation of bright objects .",
    "however , small variations could be corrected using the _ spd - rl _ routine in the interactive analysis package .    once the above operations using the interactive analysis package were completed , the data were processed further using the @xmath0 spectral analysis package ( isap ) .",
    "first , glitches flagged by the initial pipeline processing were removed using the algorithm provided in isap . generally , about 30% of the total number of data points were rejected including some entire scans .",
    "another concern is whether any flux was inadvertently lost or gained due to @xmath0 s nominal @xmath11 1@xmath16 pointing error .",
    "the sws apertures cover an area larger than i  zw  36 , which has an angular extent of roughly @xmath17 x @xmath18 as well as hubble  v , with a fwhm of @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "a thorough review of the current readouts from each observation showed no systematic variation with time , only occasional spikes due to cosmic ray hits and noise .",
    "variations in the average current level would have indicated that the objects were falling in and out of the aperture during the scans .",
    "this implies that pointing error or jitter did not cause the objects to fall out of the aperture .",
    "the observed @xmath0 line fluxes for i  zw  36 and ngc 6822 are given in table 2 , and plots of the spectra can be found in figure 1 .",
    "estimates of the magnitudes of flux calibration uncertainties were given in leech ( 1997 ) for several of these problems .",
    "uncertainties due to the memory effects were reported to be on the order of @xmath20 in band 2 ( br@xmath1 ) and @xmath21 in band 4 ( [ s  iii ] @xmath22 and [ s  iv ] @xmath23 ) .",
    "therefore there is a potential uncertainty of up to nearly @xmath24 in the relative flux calibrations between bands .",
    "furthermore , the spectral energy distributions of standard objects used in flux calibrations are known only to between @xmath25 .",
    "these systematic uncertainties are not included in the line flux errors cited in table 2 .",
    "there exist several sources of published optical data for hubble  v @xcite and i  zw  36 @xcite which allow a comparison of the abundances derived from optical and infrared [ s  iii ] transitions .",
    "observed values of line ratios relevant to this paper are given in table 3 .",
    "a comparison of the abundances derived from these sources with the abundances derived from our @xmath0 observations can be found in  3.3 . of the hubble  v observations , only those of lequeux et al .",
    "( 1979 ) include a measurement of the [ s  iii ] @xmath26 line through a large aperture .",
    "we therefore adopt these optical observations for comparison with our infrared measurements .",
    "note that the reddening corrections for the infrared emission line ratios used in this paper are negligible .",
    "prior to determining the ionic abundances from the data , electron temperatures were computed using a combination of existing published optical diagnostic data and updated atomic data from @xcite . in the case of hubble  v , four sources had [ o  iii ] data : pagel & edmunds ( 1981 ) , lequeux et al .",
    "( 1979 ) , skillman , terlevich , & melnick ( 1989 ) , and miller ( 1996 ) . from these sources ,",
    "the diagnostic ratio @xmath27 was determined .",
    "these line ratios and the derived electron temperatures are given in table 4 .",
    "adopting the lequeux et al .",
    "( 1979 ) data , the electron temperature for hubble  v was determined to be @xmath28 = 11,200@xmath291,100 k. this value is consistent , within stated errors , with the other observations and was adopted for the calculation of emissivities in the abundance calculations .",
    "viallefond & thuan ( 1983 ) and izotov , thuan & lipovetsky ( 1997 ) have reported optical spectroscopy for i  zw  36 . using the emission line fluxes from viallefond & thuan ( 1983 )",
    ", we obtain an electron temperature of 14,600@xmath29500 k , a result which corresponds closely to that given by viallefond & thuan ( 1983 ) : @xmath28 = 14,500@xmath291,300 k. however , using fluxes from izotov , thuan & lipovetsky ( 1997 ) with smaller relative observational errors , we obtained a value of @xmath28 = 16,180@xmath2970 k , which we adopt .",
    "photoionization models indicate that the electron temperature is not uniform across an h  ii region , but can be different for low - ionization and high - ionization zones , depending on metallicity ( garnett 1992 ) .",
    "we use the formulation given in garnett ( 1992 ) to estimate electron temperatures for the o@xmath30 and s@xmath8 zones , based on the derived [ o  iii ] temperature .",
    "we derive t(o@xmath30 ) = 10,800@xmath291,200 k for hubble  v and t(o@xmath30 ) = 14,330@xmath2950 k for i  zw  36 , while t(s@xmath8 ) = 11,000@xmath291,200 k and 15,130@xmath2950 k for hubble  v and i  zw  36 , respectively .",
    "since the temperatures in the low ionization zones are not observed directly , but rather are derived from photoionization models , we assume a lower limit of 500 k on the uncertainty when deriving abundances .    published spectroscopic results for these two regions give low electron densities , @xmath31 @xmath32 200 @xmath33 based on [ s  ii ] line ratios .",
    "these densities are too small to cause significant collisional de - excitation of the [ s  iii ] and [ s  iv ] lines . because of the poor signal / noise in the 33.5@xmath2 m observations , these infrared [ s  iii ] line measurements do not provide meaningful constraints on @xmath31 .      using the values of electron temperature",
    "derived in the previous section , we computed ionic abundances using a 5-level atom for o@xmath30 , o@xmath8 , s@xmath30 , and s@xmath8 from the published optical emission line data for hubble  v and i  zw  36 .",
    "collision strengths for [ o  ii ] , [ o  iii ] , and [ s  ii ] transitions were taken from the compilation of pradhan & peng ( 1995 ) .",
    "collision strengths for [ s  iii ] were taken from the 27-state r - matrix calculation of tayal & gupta ( 1999 ) , while for [ s  iv ] we took the results of the 24-state calculation of tayal ( 2000 ) .",
    "our computed abundances are listed in table 5 .",
    "we note that the new values of the effective collision strengths for the [ s  iii ] infrared fine - structure transitions represent an increase of @xmath11 30% over those of @xcite .",
    "s@xmath3 can represent a substantial fraction of the total sulfur abundance in many h  ii regions ( e.g. , lester , dinerstein , & rank 1979 ; pipher et al . 1984 ) .",
    "@xcite ( see also garnett et al .",
    "1997 ) showed that there is a sharp decrease in the observed ratio ( s@xmath34s@xmath8)/o for o@xmath30/o @xmath32 0.25 , indicating an increasing contribution from s@xmath3 in high ionization h  ii regions ( where ionization is parameterized by o@xmath35/o ) .",
    "however , the contribution of s@xmath3 often remains uncertain because [ s  iv ] has no optical transitions ; the only line in the ground configuration is at a wavelength of 10.51@xmath2 m . in most cases photoionization models",
    "are used to estimate the s@xmath3 contribution .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that sulfur ionization correction factors based on coincidences in ionization potentials greatly overpredict the actual amount of s@xmath3 in high - ionization planetary nebulae .",
    "however , the accuracy of ionization corrections based on photoionization models is largely untested for h ii regions , since very few observations exist for [ s iii ] and [ s iv ] in comparable beam sizes .",
    "therefore , an important aspect of this study is the inclusion of [ s  iv ] in the estimation of the total nebular sulfur abundance .    here ,",
    "we determine s@xmath8 and s@xmath3 abundances from our @xmath0 observations of the infrared fine structure lines [ s  iii ] 18.7@xmath2 m and [ s  iv ] 10.5@xmath2 m .",
    "we normalized the ir fine - structure lines to our br@xmath1 measurements also made with the sws . because the extinction coefficients are low in the ir and even the optical extinction to these two targets are low , the reddening corrections are negligible .",
    "given the nebular physical conditions derived in section 3.1 , we computed the s@xmath8 and s@xmath3 abundances listed in table 5 .",
    "we used only the 18.7@xmath2 m line to derive the s@xmath8 abundance , because of the low signal / noise for our 33.5@xmath2 m measurements .",
    "theoretical models and observational studies have indicated that the s / o ratio remains constant with respect to the oxygen abundance , o / h , regardless of metallicity @xcite . in figure 2",
    "we plot our newly - derived s / o values for hubble  v and i  zw  36 , along with values for other objects obtained from the literature , vs. o / h . figure 2 shows that both i  zw  36 and hubble  v have s / o values similar to those of other metal - poor h  ii regions .",
    "this result tends to support the validity of the abundance ratios derived from optical spectroscopy .",
    "current photoionization models are limited in accuracy because of uncertainties in input parameters such as stellar ionizing flux distributions . @xcite",
    "proposed the use of the ratio @xmath36 as an indicator of the  hardness \" of the photoionizing radiation field inside a nebula , which can be used to infer the effective temperature ( @xmath37 ) of the ionizing cluster .",
    "garnett ( 1989 ) showed that this is indeed an useful estimator of relative values of @xmath37 in nebulae by constructing photoionization models using different stellar atmosphere flux distributions .",
    "however , it may not be possible to derive absolute values of @xmath37 from @xmath38 , and it begins to lose its sensitivity above @xmath39 @xmath40 45,000k , as shown by skillman ( 1989 ) .",
    "values of @xmath38 for each nebula were calculated using the o / h ratios as well as the ( s@xmath41s@xmath8)/s values from table 5 and are also listed there . using figure 6 of garnett ( 1989 ) and figure 1 of @xcite",
    "we find that the @xmath38 parameter for hubble  v is consistent with @xmath37 @xmath11 45,000k ( using hummer & mihalas 1970 lte model atmospheres ) while the @xmath38 parameter for i  zw  36 is consistent with @xmath37 greater than 50,000k .",
    "this is within the range of values of @xmath38 for other giant extragalactic  regions and consistent with excitation by a mixture of hot o and b type stars ( cf .",
    "garnett 1989 ) . in the specific case of hubble  v , bianchi et al .",
    "( 2001 ) reproduce the h - r diagram for the most luminous stars in ob 8 , the stellar association powering hubble  v , and it appears that 45,000 k is a conservative upper limit to the effective temperatures of the most massive stars in this association .",
    "early studies of sulfur abundances in  regions noted that neglecting the contribution of s@xmath3 would result in an underestimate of the total sulfur abundance ( e.g. , stasinska 1978 ; french 1981 ) .",
    "the photoionization models of garnett ( 1989 ) showed a clear relationship between the s@xmath3 ionization correction and o@xmath30/o which is relatively insensitive to stellar effective temperature or abundance . in figure 3 , we show o@xmath30/o vs. log ( s@xmath35+s@xmath8)/s for the two observed nebulae and compare them to the models of stasiska ( 1990 ) for two different sequences in stellar effective temperature .",
    "the model sequences represent abundances of 0.1 times solar , similar to the metallicities of our two objects .",
    "the values for hubble  v and i  zw  36 plotted in figure 3 fall at slightly higher values of ( s@xmath35+s@xmath8)/s or lower values of o@xmath30/o than the models .",
    "this may indicate that the s@xmath3 fraction is overestimated in the models , perhaps due to line blanketing not accounted for in the stellar atmosphere fluxes .",
    "however , we caution against over - interpretation of this offset given the mismatch between the apertures for the optical and ir observations and the fact that the points in figure 3 are less than 2 @xmath42 away from the model curves .",
    "we emphasize that more observations of s@xmath30 , s@xmath8 , and s@xmath3 for the same object ( preferably with matched apertures ) will provide a valuable consistency check on the icf for s@xmath3 .",
    "corrections for the unobserved s@xmath3 abundance are now usually carried out based on photoionization modeling ( e.g. , the thuan , izotov , & lipovetsky 1995 fit to the models of stasinska 1990 ) .",
    "it is still desirable to have observational tests of these fits spanning a large range in excitation . with the advent of more sensitive ir instruments",
    ", it may eventually be possible to characterize the effective temperatures of the ionizing stars , and to determine the best nebular models to describe a given h  ii region .",
    "because optical collisionally excited line emission is weighted toward high temperature regions , abundance measurements based on optical data may not provide the true ionic abundance of a species in the h  ii region @xcite .",
    "this effect would be most extreme in a case where there is a very localized zone of high temperature embedded in a more extended , lower temperature nebula . in this case , a calculation of the s@xmath8 abundance from [ s  iii ] @xmath76312 would yield a s@xmath8 abundance lower than the true value .",
    "however , this problem can be rectified by observing lines with much smaller excitation energies , i.e. infrared fine structure transitions .",
    "because of their lower excitation energy , the volume emissivities for such transitions are insensitive to electron temperature , and as a result , emission line ratios can be converted to ionic abundances with a smaller dependence on temperature variations within the ionized gas ( e.g. , dinerstein 1986 ) .",
    "the measurement of larger abundances of an ion from infrared line observations than from optical lines would thus be an indication that there may be temperature fluctuations inside a nebula .",
    "@xcite used such an approach to estimate the magnitude of temperature fluctuations in several planetary nebulae using a combination of infrared and optical [ o  iii ] lines .",
    "comparison of the s@xmath8 abundances in table 5 show evidence of the effect of temperature fluctuations in i  zw  36 and hubble  v , although this is only significant at the 1 - 2@xmath42 level .",
    "peimbert ( 1967 ) first determined the effects of temperature fluctuations on the calculation of nebular temperatures themselves through a density - weighted ensemble average of the temperature , @xmath43 derived from an emission line .",
    "this average temperature , used in conjunction with an emission temperature , defined by : @xmath44,\\ ] ] where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the excitation energies of the two lines , can be used to define the root mean square temperature fluctuation , @xmath47^{2 } \\rangle.\\ ] ] then , assuming small fluctuations , one can perform a taylor expansion , and relate the emission temperature to the average temperature by : @xmath48,\\ ] ] where @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "an alternative formalism was created by mathis ( 1995 ) in which a fraction , @xmath51 , of the gas is assumed to be at one temperature , @xmath52 , while the rest of the gas is assumed to be at a second temperature , @xmath53 . from this , one can estimate the degree to which differing amounts of plasma at each temperature can affect the derived abundances through the optical depth : @xmath54 , where @xmath55 .",
    "we have developed a different approach that can be used to characterize the average temperature and the root - mean - square temperature fluctuations in a region .",
    "this method can be used with an arbitrary temperature distribution .    assume the gas in a nebula follows a gaussian temperature distribution , with mean temperature , @xmath56 , and a dispersion @xmath57 .",
    "let us also assume that the emission lines that we are observing have emission coefficients , at constant density , that can be characterized over a temperature range of a few times @xmath57 by a quadratic fit , @xmath58 where @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 are the coefficients of the quadratic fit of the emission coefficient .",
    "this is justified , because emission coefficients can usually be accurately approximated by quadratic polynomials over temperature ranges of several thousand degrees .",
    "then , the ratio of two emission line intensities ( @xmath62 ) , which can be generally written as : @xmath63 can be convolved with the normalized gaussian temperature distribution so that we have : @xmath64 where @xmath65.\\ ] ] upon integration from @xmath66 to @xmath67 , the relation becomes @xmath68 which holds to a good degree of accuracy due to the square - exponential behavior of the kernel in the integrand .",
    "however , one should be aware that in this approximation , the gaussian kernel , @xmath69 , has some mean temperature , @xmath70 , and width , @xmath71 . if @xmath72 , then there are no problems , but if @xmath73 , then a significant portion of the kernel may correspond to temperatures @xmath74 , which is clearly non - physical and the approximation breaks down .",
    "@xmath75 3@xmath57 , then less than @xmath76 of the kernel will correspond to negative temperatures , and the approximation will hold .",
    "let the line ratio divided by the abundance be given by @xmath77 then it is possible to solve for the temperature fluctuations , @xmath78 , using the equation @xmath79 we will refer to equation ( 13 ) as the  diagnostic equation . \"",
    "equation ( 13 ) yields a locus of points in @xmath56 , @xmath78 space : a curve for a single , fixed value for the observed line ratio , @xmath62 , and , for different values of @xmath56 , different gaussian temperature distributions of variance @xmath80 centered on @xmath56 .",
    "so by using additional line ratios , one establishes a diagnostic in which it is possible to solve explicitly for the ionic temperature and the temperature fluctuations in the gas ( as done for [ o  iii ] by dinerstein , lester , & werner 1985 ) .",
    "furthermore , provided three or more collisionally excited lines relative to an h recombination line are available for a given ionic species , the abundance of that species can also be solved for simultaneously .",
    "the calculated temperature variance , @xmath81 is related to the traditional @xmath82 by definition : @xmath83 which holds even if the true distribution of the gas temperature is not gaussian .",
    "if a case arises in which a gaussian distribution is not appropriate , this method is adaptable so that other ( normalized ) kernels can be applied as well . for example , assuming a normalized rectangle function ( a top - hat ) temperature distribution , with half - width @xmath84 , given by : @xmath85    then one obtains an equation identical to ( 11 ) , but of the form @xmath86 keeping in mind that @xmath87 can be related to @xmath88 by : @xmath89 other distribution functions that also could be used include the lorentzian distribution or the triangle distribution with a base width of @xmath90 , given by    @xmath91    the triangle distribution and a truncated lorentzian distribution which has limits placed on the width of the wings at its base also yield equation ( 11 ) . for the triangle distribution , @xmath92 , while the truncated lorentzian possesses a more complicated relationship between its width , base limits , and @xmath88 .",
    "initially , we tested the diagnostic by checking whether it would be able to determine the physical properties of a model of a gas cloud with an average temperature @xmath93 = 12,000 k , temperature fluctuations @xmath57 = 2,000 k , and an abundance approximately equal to that of hubble  v. we used emission coefficients given by the stsdas _ nebular.ionic _",
    "routine @xcite , each of which was fitted using a second - order polynomial .",
    "coefficients for these fits are listed in table 6 .",
    "then the square root of equation ( 14 ) was plotted using various line ratios involving [ s  iii ] and [ o  iii ] forbidden lines and h recombination lines , assuming the physical conditions given above , by varying @xmath56 in order to determine @xmath56 and @xmath57 simultaneously .",
    "figure 4 shows these diagnostic lines for the case of the nebula described above .",
    "the top panel shows diagnostics from combinations of [ s  iii ] and h recombination lines while the bottom panel shows diagnostics from combinations of [ o  iii ] lines .",
    "diagnostics involving different combinations of emission lines have different sensitivities to temperature and temperature fluctuations . in order to simultaneously determine the temperature and the temperature fluctuations one would ideally use two combinations of emission lines that yield diagnostics that intersect at nearly right angles . for example ,",
    "this is roughly the case in the top panel of figure 4 between the [ s  iii ] @xmath26/@xmath22 and the @xmath4/@xmath22 diagnostics .",
    "the models on which figure 4 is based show an additional feature of the diagnostic .",
    "the diagnostics involving lines originating solely from one ion intersect at a point that is independent of ionic abundance . however , when using diagnostics that involve ratios of ionic to h recombination lines , this is no longer the case",
    ". therefore , it is possible to simultaneously determine the ionic abundance as well as the temperature and temperature fluctuations , provided that strengths of enough emission lines are known so that the three unknowns can be calculated , and that the ions in question reside in regions of the same @xmath93 and @xmath57 .    because the diagnostics are comprised of ratios of emission lines with different temperature sensitivities ( the @xmath4/@xmath22 diagnostic , for example ) , the sensitivity of the diagnostic will vary with temperature . graphically , the diagnostic lines appear to rotate as either the temperature or the temperature fluctuations are varied",
    ". therefore it may be necessary to mix and match combinations of emission lines in order to have orthogonally - crossing diagnostic lines that provide the most stringent determination of the nebular parameters . a general rule of thumb for most nebular conditions would be to use combinations involving nebular ( transitions between the middle and lowest terms in an ionic configuration , e.g. [ s  iii ] @xmath79532 ) , auroral ( transitions between the highest and middle terms , e.g. [ s  iii ] @xmath76312 ) , and fine structure features",
    ".      an optimal combination of emission lines consisting of the nebular , auroral , and fine - structure lines of an ionic species as well as hydrogen recombination lines will allow the simultaneous determination of the nebular temperature , temperature fluctuations , and the abundance of the species with respect to hydrogen ( see equation 13 ) .",
    "unfortunately , for most h  ii regions , published observations do not exist for all of these types of transitions ( or , as in the present case , they have not been observed through matched apertures ) , so we are unable to use our diagnostic technique fully with the present data .",
    "however , in this section we will demonstrate the use of the diagnostic using two approaches .",
    "first , we will demonstrate the usefulness of the diagnostic using our @xmath0 and ground - based measurements for hubble  v and i  zw  36 .",
    "this exercise will not lead to accurate estimates of t , @xmath57 , and abundances , because of the relatively large uncertainties in the line ratios and the fact that we did not have an optimal set of [ s  iii ] line ratios .",
    "however , it will serve as an illustration of the method on real data .",
    "next , we will show the ability of the diagnostic to make rough predictions of the conditions inside a nebula using synthetic data .      for hubble  v and",
    "i  zw  36 we have measurements of [ s  iii ] @xmath26 , @xmath94 m , and h recombination lines .",
    "thus , we have essentially only two diagnostic line ratios , which is not sufficient to determine @xmath93 , @xmath78 and the s@xmath8 abundance simultaneously .",
    "another [ s  iii ] line , for example the nebular [ s  iii ] 9532   transition , is needed for a full solution .",
    "nevertheless , we can still provide an instructive example and set constrains on @xmath57 if we assume that the s@xmath8 abundances that we calculated from our _ iso _ [ s  iii ] @xmath95 observations are correct .",
    "this abundance was based on the measurement of the electron temperature from the [ o  iii ] lines and an assumption of no temperature fluctuations . in principle",
    ", this assumption should be ok because the fine - structure lines have weak sensitivity to temperature fluctuations .",
    "how bad is this assumption ?",
    "from equation ( 4 ) in garnett ( 1992 ) , which is just an update of peimbert ( 1967 ) equation ( 15 ) , we can get the ion - weighted mean electron temperature , t(o@xmath8 ) , from the measured t(o  iii ) and an estimate of @xmath9 . for t(o",
    "iii ) @xmath96 11,200 k and a @xmath9 value of 0.04 , t(o@xmath8 ) @xmath96 10,000 k. since s@xmath8/h@xmath30 is roughly proportional to t@xmath97 for the ir lines , for commonly claimed values of 0.03 to 0.04 for @xmath9 , the uncertainty in the s@xmath8/h@xmath30 abundance is less than 10% ( which is smaller than our quoted errors ) . thus , this is probably not a bad assumption to adopt for an illustrative example .",
    "the results are shown in figure 5 for both hubble  v and i  zw  36 , where it should be noted that with the assumption of the s@xmath8/h abundance , we are left with only two undetermined variables : @xmath98 and @xmath78 .",
    "this allows us to work in two dimensions and two diagnostics rather than three .",
    "we did , however , include a third diagnostic ( @xmath76312/18.7@xmath99 ) in figure 5 to ensure that all of the diagnostic lines crossed at the same point and produced consistent results .    in figure 5 ,",
    "the diagnostic curves are grouped by line ratio .",
    "the center line in each group represents the results of equation 13 for each observed line ratio ; the parallel curves represent the spread caused by the @xmath100 observational errors in the line ratios .",
    "the expected value of @xmath57 will lie at the centroid of the @xmath101 error box . in section 3.2",
    ", we derived [ s  iii ] temperatures of @xmath102 for hubble  v and @xmath103 for i  zw  36 , based on the estimates from [ o  iii ] temperatures .",
    "meanwhile , from the diagnostics in figure 5 we obtain t[s  iii ] @xmath104 for hubble  v , and @xmath105 for i  zw  36 .",
    "both of the values of t[s  iii ] derived from fig .",
    "5 are in good agreement with those derived in section 3.1 .",
    "the data presented in figure 5 are consistent with a very large range in @xmath57 corresponding to values of @xmath9 from 0 up to roughly 0.2 , which is much larger than values usually considered . to provide better constraints on @xmath57",
    "we would need to obtain higher quality observations of the infrared [ s  iii ] lines as well as include observations of [ s  iii ] @xmath69069,9532 . in the next section",
    "we demonstrate the quality of data necessary for this goal .",
    "the approach that was followed in figure 5 is quite useful for the quick determination of the nebular conditions , however we have only used a rudimentary method for determining the errors associated with the original data .",
    "this problem is exacerbated by the fact that under some circumstances , the formal simultaneous solution of multiple diagnostics of the form given in equation ( 14 ) may in fact yield @xmath106 .",
    "this could easily arise from observational uncertainties , but if the error propagation is carried out properly then one would expect the solution to be _ consistent _ with positive values for @xmath71 .    in order to develop a better understanding of the error analysis , we developed a monte carlo simulation to generate synthetic observations of line ratios whose values are specified along with their corresponding observational errors .",
    "the specified line ratios and errors are sent through the diagnostic so that each observation is plotted as a point on the @xmath78 vs. @xmath98 plane .",
    "the intensity of points on the plane is the distribution that arises from a large number of observations , smeared by observational errors .",
    "we have plotted two examples of this in figure 6 .",
    "the top panel in figure 6 shows the distribution of points that arises from [ s  iii ] line ratios corresponding to an isothermal nebula at @xmath107 , with observational errors of 2% in optical and near - infrared lines ratios and 5% in line ratios with infrared lines .",
    "the peak of the distribution lies at the point that would be determined in the absence of observational errors .",
    "this plot also shows that roughly half of the realizations in the simulation yield @xmath106 .",
    "however , the contours corresponding to 1 and 2@xmath42 errors in the determination of the nebular parameters show that the observations could correspond to small fluctuations .",
    "the 1@xmath42 error corresponds to roughly @xmath9 @xmath11 0.04 .",
    "thus , it is possible to make significant constraints on temperature fluctuations using combinations of optical , near - infrared , and infrared [ s iii ] lines .",
    "similarly , the bottom panel of figure 6 shows the distribution of realizations resulting from inputs corresponding to @xmath107 and @xmath108 ( @xmath109 , which corresponds to @xmath110 ) , smeared by the same errors as above .",
    "it is now apparent that the diagnostic lines resulting from observations @xmath100 errors do roughly correspond to the @xmath101 bounds on the determinations of the nebular parameters .",
    "two things should be noted here .",
    "first , the low observational errors assumed in the calculations are difficult to achieve in practice , and matching apertures is critical .",
    "long slit spectra of either spatially unresolved sources ( e.g. , extragalactic ) or galactic hii regions where the variations can be traced along the slit are probably best suited for this type of work .",
    "it is probably best to obtain ratios to h recombination lines in all cases ( i.e. , h@xmath1 in the optical , p8 , p9 , and p10 in the near - infrared , and br@xmath1 in the infrared ) to provide a normalization .",
    "second , it is important to point out that for different temperature ranges , different ionic species will provide better constraints .",
    "for example , in the example presented in figure 6 , a combination of [ o  iii ] lines ( with the same magnitude of relative errors ) gives roughly a factor of two stronger constraint ( @xmath9 @xmath111 0.02 ) on the presence of temperature fluctuations .",
    "we have reported new iso observations of the mid - infrared fine structure [ s  iii ] and [ s  iv ] lines .",
    "these lines are of great importance to the accurate determination of nebular total sulfur abundances .",
    "this is due to the strong dependence of higher excitation lines on temperature , along with the fact that there are no strong optical lines for either of these species . with our observations",
    ", we have shown that s@xmath3 can constitute a large fraction of the total sulfur abundance in extragalactic h  ii regions .",
    "this means that if one is to determine accurately the total sulfur abundance without model dependence as in equation ( 4 ) , then one must make infrared observations of the fine structure [ s  iii ] and [ s  iv ] lines . once infrared observations are made , it becomes possible to test not only useful techniques such as the determination of the radiation `` hardness '' @xcite and the determinations of the total sulfur abundance as in equation ( 4 ) @xcite , but it becomes possible to test the accuracy of photoionization models .",
    "our data suggest that ionization corrections for sulfur based on oxygen ion ratios and photoionization models are valid .",
    "the presence of temperature fluctuations in nebulae can complicate the determination of nebular abundances .",
    "we have developed a new , generalized diagnostic capable of determining the amplitude of these fluctuations by assuming a gaussian temperature distribution in these nebulae , although this method can be applied to any normalized distribution .",
    "the uncertainties in our iso measurements and the lack of observations of [ s  iii ] @xmath4 or @xmath5 did not allow an accurate determination of the amplitude of temperature fluctuations for hubble  v and i  zw  36 using our method .",
    "a significant challenge is presented by combining large aperture infrared spectra with relatively small aperture optical spectra .",
    "future long slit spectrographs available with sofia and sirtf will allow us to overcome this challenge .",
    "as these more powerful instruments become available , observational uncertainties should decrease , allowing a more accurate determination of the size of the temperature fluctuations and other nebular parameters .    in the future , one can consider extensions to the present analysis .",
    "for example , the potential to calculate spatially unresolved density fluctuations in a similar mathematical framework remains relatively unexplored , although @xcite has considered the biasing of ir density indicators by density fluctuations .",
    "like temperature fluctuations , density fluctuations can also affect nebular line ratios , and they may have significant effects on nebular physical parameters which must be constrained in order to develop better nebular models . to this end ,",
    "application of this diagnostic to published data on a large number of h  ii regions may be useful in characterizing the variances found in h  ii regions .",
