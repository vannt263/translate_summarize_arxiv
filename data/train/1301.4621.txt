    "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are sustained by the accretion of material from their local environment onto a super  massive ( m@xmath510@xmath6 - 10@xmath7m@xmath8 ) black hole . in the unified model of agn , the observed diversity in emission - line profiles of agn is believed to be an observational bias introduced by the relative inclinations ( with respect to the observer ) of the central engine as it is nested within a toroid of dense molecular material @xcite .",
    "observations of the `` zoo '' of agn ( e.g. , seyferts , bl lac objects , radio galaxies ) from x  ray to radio wavelengths have been remarkably well  explained by the unified model ( for a review , see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "despite the success of the model , numerous agn in the local universe are not well  explained within the paradigm of the unified model .",
    "many tests of the unified model have concentrated on the observed diversity in the properties of seyfert galaxies , which are broadly classified by their emission line profiles as@xmath9 a ) sy11.9 ( sy1 ) , observed with both broad ( _ v_@xmath510@xmath10 km s@xmath11 ) and narrow line emission ; and b ) seyfert 2 ( sy2 ) , observed only with narrow line emission .",
    "for example , @xcite identified sy2 agn that lack `` hidden '' sy1 agn as predicted by unified model , indicating that sy2s may not be  as a class  identical to sy1 agn .",
    "furthermore , @xcite found that the column density of absorbers in sy2 agn implies the existence of dust absorbers on a larger physical scale ( @xmath0@xmath51 kpc ) than the molecular toroid .",
    "recently , @xcite found `` excess '' x  ray emission from reflection in sy2 agn , that did not appear to a comparable extent in sy1 agn , indicating an environmental distinction between these two classes of agn .",
    "malkan , gorjian , & tam ( 1998 , hereafter mgt98 ) tested the unified model via a `` snapshot '' campaign ( see  [ sec : thedataset ] for details ) conducted with _",
    "hst _ wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) using the f606w ( @xmath12=5907 ) filter , in which they observed the morphology of the inner core ( @xmath131 kpc ) of 184 local ( z@xmath10.035 ) seyfert galaxies .",
    "the authors visually inspected these images and determined that sy1s are preferentially located in galaxies of `` earlier  type '' core morphology , and conversely that sy2 agn are more often hosted by galaxies with `` later  type '' cores .",
    "mgt98  also determined that the distribution of dust is more irregular and extends closer to the nucleus in sy2 galaxies than it does in sy1 agn .",
    "hereafter , we refer to these two empirical relationships as the `` mgt98 relationship . ''",
    "these independent studies suggest that there may be a fundamental physical distinction between sy1 and sy2  galaxies , that is not explained by the relative inclination of the thick , gas - rich toroidal in which the agn central engine is embedded .",
    "the contemporary debate on the nature of agn is not framed exclusively by the unified model ; other models of the central engine and the dusty accretion disk do exist ( e.g. , the  clumpy torus  model of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but we will discuss our analysis in the context of the unified model to provide an easier comparison with published results in the literature .    in the past two decades , _ hst _ images and spectroscopy has been used to study hundreds of low redshift ( @xmath14 ) agn , and many of these observations are now available in the hubble legacy archive ( hla)//hla.stsci.edu ] , an online repository maintained as a service for the community by the space telescope science institute .    in this study , we test the unified model using images downloaded from the hla . specifically , we re  examine and extend the analysis first established in mgt98  using a catalog of 85 seyfert galaxies selected using the criteria outlined in  [ sec : thedataset ] . in  [ sec : visclass ] , we present the results of the visual inspection and classification of our catalog seyfert galaxies . in  [ sec : modginim20 ] , we present , apply and discuss an automated technique , which we use to quantify the distribution of any dust features ( e.g. , dust , stellar clusters , etc . ) present in the cores of our catalog galaxies .",

    "to test the mgt98 relationship , we require a sufficiently large sample of sy1 and sy2 agn to ensure that any result can be interpreted in a statistically meaningful way .",
    "we therefore use the following selection criteria to identify this sample of agn@xmath9    * _ initial catalog_@xmath9 we develop a large ( n@xmath19240 ) catalog from three large _ hst _ surveys of seyfert galaxies ( ho et al . 1997 ; mgt98 ; ho & peng 2001 ) that were included in the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned//ned.ipac.caltech.edu ) ] ) .",
    "we refer the reader to the respective surveys for specific details associated with the sample selection of these agn .",

    "we only used the mosaiced images to ensure that the intrinsically different pixel scales of the individual ccds did not bias the identification and classification of sources .",
    "the hla contains an image for more than 90% of the galaxies included in our initial catalog with this specific camera and filter combination .",
    "the fact that these images are available is partly a selection bias .",
    "many of the observations we include in our catalog were observed by mgt98  in the snapshot campaign .",
    "note that the f606w filter samples longward of the 4000@xmath20break at all relevant redshifts in our catalog .",

    "_ `` face  on''_@xmath9 we only included `` face  on '' galaxies to ensure that the dust features classified in  [ sec : visclass ] are physically confined to a region relatively close to the core ( 1 kpc ) of the galaxy .",
    "we estimated the angle of inclination by eye , and excluded an additional 20% of agn that appeared at inclinations approximately greater than 30@xmath22 .",
    "we did _ not _ exclude those galaxies with inclination angles that could not be estimated ( i.e. , irregular galaxies ) , nor do we exclude elliptical galaxies . * _ distance less than 63 mpc_@xmath9 we are interested in characterizing the structural properties of dust features with a linear size scale greater than 100 pc ( for more details , see  [ subsec : sextractmeth ] ) .",
    "we require at least 3.5 wfpc2 pixels ( 035 in the hla mosaic images ) to span this physical scale .",
    "this sets the maximum allowable distance to a catalog galaxy of 63 mpc or , equivalently , to a redshift @xmath23@xmath1@xmath24 .",
    "kiloparsec scale features ( e.g. , dust lanes and clump  cloud formations such as bars , wisps , and tidal features like warps and tails ) are easily discernible in galaxies nearer than this distance observed at the hst spatial resolution .",
    "we excluded an additional 50% of galaxies that were at distances greater than 63 mpc .",
    "we model and discuss the dependence of the morphological classification parameters on spatial resolution ( appendix a ) , and the galaxy distance ( appendix b ) .",
    "31 sy1 and 54 sy2 galaxies from the initial sample met all of these selection criteria , combined for a total of 85 seyfert galaxies .",
    "this large sample ensures that the ( poisson ) uncertainties from small number statistics are small .",
    "our catalog includes significantly fewer sy1 than sy2 galaxies , partly due to a bias towards sy2 agn in the initial sample .",
    "for example , only 44% of the galaxies in mgt98  are classified as sy1 agn . in the unified model , this represents a bias in the opening angle through which the agn is viewed . though this bias may be present",
    ", it will not significantly affect this study , because we are investigating the _ core _ morphological distinctions between the agn sub - classes of the host galaxies ( i.e. , on scales of hundreds of parsecs , well beyond the @xmath13parsec scale of the thick , dusty torus ) .",
    "where the data are available from ned , we plot the number of seyfert galaxies by their devaucouleurs galaxy type and 60@xmath25 m flux in figures [ fig : morphodistro ] & [ fig : oiifir ] , respectively .",
    "these figures demonstrate that our catalog is not strongly dominated by a particular galaxy type or observed agn luminosity .",
    "we prepared the hla mosaiced images for analysis by first visually identifying the ( bright ) center of each galaxy .",
    "we extracted a core region with physical dimensions of 2@xmath262 kpc centered at this point .",
    "the hla images that we used have only been processed to the level 2 standard , i.e. , only images acquired during the same visit are drizzled and mosaiced in the hla .",
    "many of the galaxies were originally imaged as part of _ hst _ snapshot surveys ( single exposures with @xmath27 500s ) . as a result",
    ", cosmic rays can be a significant source of image noise in the mosaics .",
    "we used the routine , @xmath28 @xcite to clean the ccd images of cosmic rays//www.astro.yale.edu / dokkum / lacosmic/ ] .",
    "initially , we implemented @xmath28  using the author s suggested parameters , but found by iteration that a lower value for the object@xmath29detection contrast parameter , sigclip=2.5 , produced cleaner images without significantly affecting the pixels of apparent scientific interest .",
    "additional cleaning and preparation of the imaging was necessary for the following analyses , and we discuss those task  specific steps taken in  [ subsec : methodol ] .",
    "the core morphologies of the agn  host galaxies are diverse and early  and late  type morphologies , with varying degrees of complexity in dust and gas features , are represented in the catalog . in figure",
    "[ fig : fourpanels ] , we provide images of a subset ( 12 ) of our galaxies ; each image has been scaled logarithmically .",
    "images of all ( 85 ) galaxies are available in the electronic supplement to this article . here",
    ", we use this subset of galaxies specifically to discuss the various dust features and structures that we classify by eye .",
    "galaxies in our catalog display a wide variety of spiral arms  like features . in figure",
    "[ fig : fourpanels ] , we provide images of two galaxies ( mark1330 , ngc3081 ) that show distinct spiral arms .",
    "these features are easily distinguished from the ambient stellar light profile in the core of each image . in some galaxies , these arms",
    "are reminiscent of galactic ",
    "scale spiral features , such as barred spirals ( ngc3081 ) .",
    "some spiral  arm like features are more unique .",
    "for example , mark1330 has a single arm that appears to in - spiral and connect with the bright core of the galaxy .",
    "furthermore , some galaxies appear to be relatively dusty with numerous features of various size scales , appearing in either organized or chaotic features ( e.g. ngc1068 , ngc1386 , ngc1672 , ngc3393 ) .    in figure [",
    "fig : fourpanels ] , we also provide examples of galaxies whose cores are relatively sparsely populated with dust features . in some cases ( e.g. , ngc3608 ) , these galaxies have few dust features . in other galaxies ( e.g. , ngc1058 ) dust features appear most pronounced in the core of the galaxy ( 100 - 200 pc ) and are less significant at large radii .",
    "we have visually inspected and classified each of the 85 galaxies in our catalog , first using the following criteria that were defined and used in mgt98 .",
    "we divide these criteria into two general classes@xmath9    class 1dust classifiers@xmath9    * * di * @xmath9 irregular dust ; * * dc * @xmath9 dust  disk / dust  lane passing close or through center ( i.e. , bi  sected nucleus ) ; * * d * @xmath9 direction of dust lanes on one side of major axis , where direction is n , s , e , w , nw , ne , sw , or se ; * * f / w * @xmath9 filaments / wisps , and ;    class 2ancillary classifiers@xmath9    * * r * @xmath9 ring ; * * e / s0*@xmath9 elliptical or lenticular ; * * b * @xmath9 bar ; * * cl * @xmath9 cluster , lumpy h 2 region , knots ;    four observers ( prh , hk , mjr , kt ) inspected the 2@xmath262 kpc postage stamp images in figure [ fig : fourpanels ] and classified each of the seyfert cores .",
    "we did not use the `` normal '' classifier , because its definition could not be independently inferred from mgt98 . in practice",
    ", we note that galaxies that showed regular spiral and dust features in their core morphology were more often classified as f / w .",
    "conversely those with more irregular spiral and dust features was classified as di .",
    "these classifications are not mutually exclusive , i.e. , galaxies could be classified as both di and f / w . in table [",
    "tab : gallist ] all unique visual inspections are provided .    the majority ( 91% ) of galaxies",
    "were identified with dust features .",
    "irregular dust features ( di ) were observed in 42% ( 13/31 ) of sy1 and 57% ( 31/54 ) of sy2 agn .",
    "in contrast , 68% ( 21/31 ) of sy1 , and ( 31/54 ) 57% of sy2 host galaxies , showed regular filaments and wispy features ( f / w ) .",
    "thus , by visual inspection , we find that sy1 host galaxies are more regular in their dust morphologies than are sy2 host galaxies , while sy2 host galaxies are more chaotic or irregular in their dust morphologies than are sy1 host galaxies .",
    "to reduce ambiguity in the classification of regular and irregular dust features in our galaxies , and to provide a second confirmation of the mgt98 relationship , we developed an additional system specifically for the classification of the core dust morphology of seyfert galaxies .",
    "this classification scheme is defined as follows@xmath9    * * 1 * -``nuclear spiral''distribution of features resembles a flocculent or grand - design spiral ; * * 2 * -``bar''a bar  like feature in emission or absorption extends outward from the center of the galaxy ; * * 3 * -``dust - specific classification''the previous designations considered all structure .",
    "the following classifications describe only the quality and spatial distribution of what we consider to be dust@xmath9 * * _ group a_@xmath9 * * * * s*-``late - type spiral''dust appears distributed in a spiral pattern throughout more than 50% of the image .",
    "the `` inner - arm '' regions appear to be clear of any dust ; * * * * i*-``irregular''no visually distinguishable pattern can be identified in the spatial distribution of dust , i.e. , the dust is patchy and irregular in form ; * * _ group b_@xmath9 * * * * m*-``high extinction''dust features appear to be of high column density .",
    "the galaxy appears highly extincted .",
    "dust lanes appear to `` cut '' through the ambient stellar light of the galaxy ; * * * * l*-``low extinction''low contrast dust is present , but is barely discernible from the ambient stellar light .    in table",
    "[ tab : fitpars ] , we provide the classification using this scheme . if possible , galaxies were classified using class 1 and 2 , but all galaxies were classified according to their dust structure ( class 3 ) .",
    "the sub - groups of class 3 ( a&b ) were mutually exclusive ; e.g. , no galaxy could be classified as ` 3is ' .",
    "galaxies could be classified by a single group a and one group b classification simultaneously ( e.g. , ` 3mi ' ) .",
    "if there was a conflict in classifying dust structure amongst the four co - authors , the _ majority _ classification is listed in table [ tab : fitpars ] .",
    "if no majority was reached after first classification , the corresponding author made the final classification _ without knowledge of the seyfert class _ in order to prevent any unintentional bias in the measurement of the malkan relationship .",
    "the wfpc2 f606w filter we used in this image classification is broad ( @xmath304800 - 7200 ) and includes the h@xmath31[nii ] line complex . in principle",
    ", this line emission could affect our visual classification . in practice",
    ", the contribution of _ line flux _ to the continuum is relatively minor  the contribution of the [ nii ] doublet to the total flux in this bandpass using the sdss qso composite spectrum @xcite is @xmath321% , and we estimate the ratio of the equivalent widths , ew@xmath33/ew@xmath34}$ ] , of these lines to be @xmath35 . despite the minor contribution to the total observed flux in line emission , the photo  ionization of the gas - rich local medium by the central engine can produce significant `` hotspots '' at the wavelengths of these atomic lines , which appear as structure in the image .",
    "@xcite has studied an example of this photo  ionization structure , the spiral - like `` s '' structure in one of our sample seyferts hosts ( ngc3393 ; see figure [ fig : fourpanels ] ) .",
    "though this emission contributes very little to the total _",
    "flux _ in the core , the high contrast between these bright emitting sources and the local area could lead to `` false positive '' classifications of dust features .",
    "fortunately , few agn ( @xmath137 - 8 galaxies , see e.g. , mark3 , mark1066 , ngc1068 , ngc3393 , ngc4939 , & ngc7682 in figure [ fig : fourpanels ] of the online supplement ) show evidence of these emitting structures and these highly localized structures are easy to distinguish , in practice , from the stellar and dust continuum .    in conclusion , we confirm that sy2 host galaxies are significantly _ more _ likely to have irregular core morphologies@xmath9 58% of sy2 host galaxies were classified as ` 3i ' .",
    "in contrast , only 40% of sy1 host galaxies were classified as ` 3i ' .",
    "furthermore , 39% sy2 agn were classified as ` 3s ' in contrast to 53% of sy1 host galaxies .",
    "the results of our visual classification agrees with the observations in mgt98 .",
    "although visual inspection can be an effective means of classifying the morphology of spatially resolved sub  structure in galaxies , it has its disadvantages as well .",
    "visual inspection is time  consuming , it does not provide a quantifiable and independently reproducible measure of the irregularity of structures that can be directly compared with the results of similar studies , and it can be highly subjective . though guidance was provided to the co - authors on how to classify varying degrees of dust structure using the class 3 , such classifications are highly subjective and conflicts in classification could arise between co - authors .",
    "for example , approximately 55% of the visual classifications of dust structure ( table [ tab : fitpars ] ) were _ not _ unanimous .",
    "this discrepancy can be largely attributed to the subjective definition of the class 3 sub - classifications . in each galaxy ,",
    "the co - authors implicitly emphasized certain dust features when making their classification . in many galaxies ,",
    "whether the authors chose to weight the significance of physically small or large - scale dust structure could change the structural classification significantly .",
    "consider the case of ngc1365@xmath9 this galaxy was classified with an irregular dust morphology due to the small - scale dust features that appear to dominate the visible sub - structure in the core .",
    "but , authors who ( subconsciously or otherwise ) emphasized the broad dust `` lanes '' in the north and ( to a lesser extent ) south may classify the core as having a `` spiral '' dust morphology . neither classification is necessarily incorrect  the broad dust lanes are clearly associated with the prominent spiral arms in this galaxy when viewed in full scale .",
    "these complicating factors can weaken any conclusion drawn from the visual classification of galaxies .    in recent decades , as image analysis software and parametric classification techniques have become prevalent , the astrophysical community has implemented automated methods for galaxy classification ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . by relegating the task of object classification to automated software and algorithmic batch processing ,",
    "these methods have gained popularity , because they can significantly reduce the time observers must spend inspecting each galaxy , and can provide a reproducible classification for each galaxy ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , we extend our original test of the unified model to include a quantitative assessment of the morphological differences between seyfert galaxies that we identified by visual inspection .",
    "we present these techniques in  [ sec : modginim20 ] and  [ sec : sexintro ] .",
    "our use of quantitative parameters to measure morphological distinctions between seyfert core morphologies can provide a more robust test of the mgt98 relationship@xmath20 by reducing some of the biases implicit in visual inspection .",
    "a variety of parameters have been defined in the literature to quantify galaxy morphology .",
    "these parameters are distinguished by their use of a pre - defined functional form ",
    "parametric or non - parametric  to express galaxy morphology .",
    "some popular non - parametric morphological parameters are `` cas '' ( * ? ? ?",
    "*  concentration  ,  asymmetry  , and  clumpiness  ) and `` gini  m@xmath4 '' ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? *  gini coefficient  and m@xmath4 , the second  order moment of brightest 20% of the galaxy pixels ) .",
    "these methods are not without limitations ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but they each can be useful for assessing galaxy morphology in a user  independent and quantitative way .",
    "we chose to use these parameters in this research project , because the distribution of dust features in the cores of seyfert galaxies is unlikely to be well - described by a single functional form , e.g. , the srsic function that broadly distinguishes between elliptical and spiral galaxy light profiles .",

    "although this parameter was originally developed by economists to study wealth distribution , this parameter can be applied to understand the distribution of light in galaxies .",
    "if the distribution of light in galaxies is sequestered in relatively few bright pixels , the gini coefficient approximately equals unity .",

    "too many of these features were broken into multiple unique objects . to alleviate the over  segmentation , we increased the detect_minarea parameter . in order to recover the majority of the visually identified dust features though",
    ", this parameter must be set unfavorably high ; dust features were only detected when they were included as a component of a much larger , brighter object .",
    "direct detection of dust features with _ sextractor _",
    "is difficult .",

    "_ sextractor _",
    "is designed to detect peaks _ above _ the local background . in the images ,",
    "the local background is bright , and not likely to be smooth because it arises from the ambient stellar background and not the astronomical / zodiacal sky .",
    "furthermore , _ sextractor _  can not detect many of the dust features as they are observed _ in absorption _ with respect to the background .",
    "these absorption features may be brighter than the true astrophysical background , but they are still fainter than the local background .",
    "thus , no optimal _ sextractor _  parameters can be defined to exclusively select the visually identified dust features .",
    "we therefore trained _ sextractor _  to identify objects that more closely matched with dust features identified (  [ sec : visclass ] ) by coupling object detection using _ sextractor _  with the `` unsharp  mask '' technique .",
    "the unsharp  mask is a common tool for image analysis , because it enhances features of specific spatial scales . in astronomical images",
    ", these features correspond to physical objects , such as stars , star clusters , and/or dust clouds . to apply this procedure , we first convolved the wfpc2 images with a gaussian convolution kernel to create a smoothed image .",
    "next , we divided the convolved image by the original image to produce the _ inverse _ unsharp  mask image ( hereafter , ium ) . in principle , if we appropriately define our convolution kernel such that it enhances these structures of specific size",
    " scales corresponding to dust features and apply the ium , those features should now be detected as a positive signal above the local background using _ sextractor _  with the appropriate detection parameters . in figure 6 , we provide an illustration of this technique . in figure 6a&6b ) we show the core image of ngc3081 and a surface map of an inter  arm region .",
    "we convolved the image with a kernel ( figure 6c ) , and apply the ium technique to produce figure 6d . in this figure , it is apparent that the dust features in the region of interest have been enhanced by the ium technique .",
    "to produce the ium image of each galaxy , we first assumed that giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) are physically associated with dust features .",
    "we generated a gaussian convolution kernel that is specific to each galaxy , the properties of which were motivated by observations of gmcs . to produce the appropriate convolution kernel",

    "the linear size scale of gmcs is typically less than 100 pc ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "additionally , we determined that the default values for the _ sextractor _  parameters deblend_nthresh deblend_mincont equal to 32 , and 0.03 , respectively , were sufficient for dust feature detection in the ium image .",

    "a comparison of the segmentation map and the galaxy core images suggests that our general _ sextractor _",
    "technique is remarkably successful in recovering _ only _ those dust features that we identified first by visual inspection .",

    "a discussion of molecular toroid inclination effects are beyond the scope of this work , but we will consider this result in future work .",
    "we note here that this disk inclination was identified first and _ only _ by using the _ sextractor _  technique .    in images where the stellar light profile is exceptionally smooth and few dust features",
    "are identified by visual inspection , the ium technique may detect objects that do not strongly correlate with the dust features visually identified in  [ sec : visclass ] .",

    "we do not remove these galaxies from the subsequent analysis for completeness and to illustrate to the reader instances when our _ sextractor _  technique may be limited in its ability to discern visually identified dust features .",
    "we caution that object detection in these few galaxies using our ium technique may be more sensitive to local pixel  to  pixel noise variations than it is to signal variations arising from dust absorption .",
    "furthermore , in those galaxies that appear to have photo  ionization structures ( see  [ sec : visclass ] ) , the number and distribution of dust features using the ium technique still appears to be very well - correlated with the visually - identified dust features ( see , e.g. , ngc3393 in figure [ fig : fourpanels ] ) . in some galaxies , the potential photo ",
    "ionization structure appears to be the brightest structure visible in the image .",
    "it does not appear that this high contrast between photo  ionization structures and the visually - identified galactic dust structure has strongly affected the dust feature detection using the ium technique .",
    "variations in the mean signal across these structures could affect the calculation of the local sky background with _",
    "sextractor _ , and thus influence dust feature detection in those galaxies with possible photo - ionization emission structures .",

    "[ fig : coverfrac]b and [ fig : coverfrac]c , we also provide the covering fraction ( @xmath106 ) and the average number of pixels ( @xmath107 ) associated with objects detected by _ sextractor_. we fit a gaussian function to the distributions measured for each of these parameters , and observe no distinction between the gaussian centroid or fwhm measured for sy1 and sy2 , respectively ( see table [ tab : spartab2 ] ) .",
    "we confirm the similarity between the measured distributions by a k ",
    "s test , and conclude that these distributions are likely drawn from the same parent distribution .",
    "these results would not support the mgt98 relationship , or at least not demand it .    throughout this work we have considered the results of our _ only _ in the context of the unified model , as outlined in @xcite .",
    "we restricted our discussion of these results to this context , in part , because we were motivated in this work to extend the analysis first presented in @xcite , in which the authors make a similar assumption on the nature of agn .",
    "the assumption of this model is still fair ; despite extensive debate ( see  [ sec : intro ] ) the model provides a remarkably robust explanation for the observed diversity of agn .",
    "but this model is not without rivals .",
    "for example , the `` clumpy torus '' model reduces the thick , dusty torus  the inclination of which gives rise to the observed dichotomy of seyfert - type agn  to distinct individual dust clumps that are generally distributed about the central engine . in this model ,",
    "the agn type that one observes is not a `` binary '' function of perspective ; rather , the probability of observing a type 1 agn decreases as the viewer moves towards an `` edge - on '' perspective but never reaches zero .",
    "we observe a core region that is hundreds of parsecs beyond the toroid , though .",
    "thus , a full interpretation of our results in the context of this model is beyond the scope of this project and we reserve that discussion for future work .",
    "recently , multi  wavelength high spatial  resolution images and spectroscopy of agn ",
    "host galaxies have revealed that the characteristics ( e.g. , morphology , dust , properties of the emission line regions ; see  [ sec : intro ] ) of these galaxies may not be consistent with the unified model of agn .",
    "in particular , _ hst _ wfpc2 imaging of the cores of local ( @xmath23@xmath10.035 ) seyfert ",
    "host galaxies established that the morphologies of dust features in these galaxies correlates with the agn class ( mgt98 ) .",
    "we investigated this trend by visually inspecting a catalog of archival wfpc2 f606w images of the cores of 85 local ( @xmath108 ) seyfert galaxies , and classified these agn by the presence and distribution of dust features in each .",
    "we determined that sy2 galaxies were more likely to be associated with galaxies whose core dust morphology is _ more _ irregular and of `` later  type '' morphology .",
    "thus , our visual classification of our seyfert galaxies confirms the qualitative morphological relationship established by mgt98 .",
    "we concur with the conclusion of mgt98  that  if this morphological relationship is indicative of a fundamental distinction between the subclasses of agn  this result weakens the central postulate of the unified model of agn .",
    "we extended the study of this morphological relationship established through the qualitative visual method by re  analyzing the images using quantitative morphological tools .",
    "first , in  [ subsec : methodol ] and  [ subsec : origanaly ] , we developed and measured the @xmath109 and @xmath78@xmath80 parameters for the galaxies .",
    "the distribution of these parameters as measured for sy1 and sy2  agn did not strongly distinguish between the seyfert class and morphology of the host galaxy .",
    "we determined that the parameter distributions for sy1 and sy2  agn are likely drawn from the _ same _ parent distribution using a two  sample k  s test , with the exception of the concentration @xmath81 parameter . in comparison with the other four parameters in this set ,",
    "though , @xmath81 is the least sensitive parameter to the morphological features identified and classified by visual inspection .",
    "we conclude from this analysis that no strong morphological distinction exist between the cores of the sy1 and sy2  agn host galaxies .",
    "this conclusion conflicts with the established mgt98 relationship@xmath20 which we have visually confirmed in  [ sec : visclass ] . in order to resolve these apparently conflicting conclusions and to address the possibility that the @xmath109 and @xmath78@xmath80 are less effective tools for characterizing sub ",
    "kiloparsec scale dust features , we developed a new method to quantify the core dust morphologies of the agn galaxies .",
    "this method combines _ sextractor _  with the ium technique .",
    "we applied this method and found that the distributions of the average number of detected dust features in sy1 and sy2  agn may be different .",
    "thus , we have measured a quantitative distinction between sy1 and sy2  agn that supports the mgt98 relationship . yet",
    ", there was no concordance between this result and any other result ( i.e. , the radial distribution , size and covering fraction of dust features ) derived from this quantitative method .",
    "we therefore can not strongly distinguish between sy1 and sy2  agn on the basis of their core morphologies using this quantitative method .    in conclusion",
    ", we studied the relation between the host galaxy core ( @xmath110 kpc ) morphology and the seyfert class of agn .",
    "we find evidence to support this conclusion from the results of a quantitative assessment of the core dust morphology using existing and new methods .",
    "however , we can not strongly distinguish between the core dust morphology of sy1 and sy2  agn using the complete set of morphological parameters .",
    "thus , we are reluctant to suggest that the unified model of agn must be significantly modified to accommodate the results of this qualitative and quantitative analysis . in the future",
    ", better and more internally consistent _ qualitative _ and _ quantitative _ methods need to be developed to elucidate the true nature of the cores of seyfert galaxies .",

    "hst _ images .",
    "two galaxies that are identical in every possible way ( e.g. , morphologically ) , but at significantly different distances from an observer , will appear different in images obtained with the same telescope , because each ccd pixel covers an intrinsically larger physical area in the more distant galaxy . as a result ,",
    "the dust features in the more distant galaxy are less well  resolved spatially .",
    "our catalog includes galaxies in the range between 0.001 @xmath113 0.015 , or equivalently a factor of 1015 in physical distance .",
    "we selected six galaxies  ngc1068 , ngc3185 , ngc3227 , ngc3608 , ngc4725 , ngc4941with morphologies that represented the diversity of morphologies in our catalog .",
    "these galaxies are all at distances @xmath19 15 mpc , and we use these galaxies to quantify the extent to which we are able to identify or measure dust features in our catalog galaxies as a function of distance . we do not use the nearest galaxies ( @xmath114@xmath110mpc ) in our catalog because these galaxies include large off  chip regions that significantly affect the measurement of asymmetry .",
    "we then rebinned each of these galaxies to a pixel scale , _ s _ , such that @xmath9 @xmath115 where @xmath74 is number of wfpc2 010 pixels spanning 1000 pc at the physical distance , _ d _ , to the galaxy and @xmath116 corresponds to the distance to a galaxy at the upper redshift range of galaxies in our catalog ( 63 mpc ) .",
    "we measure @xmath109 and @xmath78@xmath80 for these artificially  redshifted galaxies and compare the measured values with the original measurements (  [ subsec : origanaly ] ) .",
    "this comparison is presented in table [ tab : appendixb ] as @xmath117 , where _ x _ and _ y _ are the morphological parameters measured in galaxy images at @xmath118 and artificially redshifted to @xmath116 .    in general , the measurement of these parameters does not seem to be strongly affected by the relative distance of the galaxy , at least over the relatively small redshift range that we consider in this project .",
    "for all parameters , @xmath119 is much smaller than the measured dispersion in the range of parameters measured in  [ subsec : origanaly ] .",
    "we conclude that range of measured parameters ( see figures [ fig : cgm20plot ] and [ fig : asymdist ] ) are indicative of _ morphological _ distinctions between the cores of the sample galaxies , as we assumed in the discussion in  [ subsec : origanaly ] .",
    "windhorst et al .  ( in prep . )",
    "measured the surface brightness of the zodiacal background as function of @xmath71 & @xmath72 from 6600 wfpc2 f606w and f814w archival dark  time images .",
    "we reproduce these measurements for the f606w zodiacal background from windhorst et al .",
    "( in prep . ) in figure [ fig : zodiplot ] . in  [ subsec : methodol ] we estimated the surface brightness of the zodiacal background along the line  of  sight to each galaxy in our catalog .",

    ", we compare the measurements of @xmath78 for galaxies corrected for a zodiacal background equal to@xmath9 a ) zero ( @xmath120 ) ; b ) the windhorst et al .",
    "background ( @xmath121 ) ; and c ) a hypothetical background 10 times _ larger _ than the measured in windhorst et al . the latter estimate of the background emission is highly unlikely in any _ hst _ image ( see figure [ fig : zodiplot ] ) .",
    "we assume such a large background here only to provide an upper extremum to our measurement of the effect of the background surface brightness assumption .",
    "the dispersion measured for most parameters , i.e. , @xmath109 and @xmath80 , for different estimates of the zodiacal surface brightness was small ( @xmath1221% ) .",
    "there is a large dispersion between @xmath120 and @xmath123 .",
    "we attribute this dispersion to the removal of relatively faint pixels from the measurement of @xmath78 as increasingly larger values for the sky surface brightnesses are subtracted from the images .",
    "this has the net effect of ( artificially ) enhancing the flux associated with relatively higher signal pixels , which increases @xmath78 .",
    "we note that there is a modest increase in the measurement of @xmath21 ( the slope of the object surface density function ) , when comparing cases ( a ) and ( c ) .",
    "the net effect of background on this measurement is less than 5% .",
    "hence , blindly adopting the most likely zodiacal sky  brightness as a function of @xmath71 & @xmath72when this background is not directly measurable  is an acceptable and , in our case the only viable , approach .",
    "the detection of dust features with source extractor is explicitly dependent on the detection parameters defined by the user in the configuration file . here",
    "we discuss the typical contrast level of the dust features , relative to the `` sky background '' in the images , which _ sextractor _  detected for those parameters outlined in  [ subsec : sextractmeth ] .",
    "we define the `` contrast '' as :        we measured the contrast parameters for two representative galaxies in the sample , ngc3081 and ngc3608 .",
    "the ium technique appears to work very well in detecting the dust clumps in ngc3081 , whereas ngc3608 was largely devoid of dust clumps according to the visual inspection . for each of these galaxies , we measured the contrast values for three detected dust clumps , using two relatively large but smooth `` sky '' regions ( area@xmath19100200 sq . pixels ) .",
    "the mean contrast , ( @xmath127 , the average flux associated with the dust feature ) measured for ngc3081 and ngc3608 equals 6 and 2% , respectively . assuming @xmath125 equal to the flux of the _ brightest _ pixel in each of the dust features , the mean contrast is measured to 12% and 4% for the two galaxies .",
    "we measure the relative height of the mean flux associated with the dust features above the mean sky equal to 5090@xmath128 for ngc3608 and ngc3081 , respectively .",
    "we note here the fainter sources could be detected if the _ sextractor _  detection parameters are revised , but this could introduce more `` false positive '' dust feature detections and would fragment coherent visible structure .",
