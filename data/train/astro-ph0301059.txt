    "absorption lines yielded a redshift of @xmath11 @xcite for the highest redshift absorber .",
    "this system shows kinematic substructure , with two distinct systems at @xmath12 and @xmath13 , corresponding to a restframe velocity separation of 106 km s@xmath14 , typical for internal motions in galaxies @xcite .",
    "the equivalent widths of the lines are unusually strong in comparison to metallic line absorbers seen in the spectra of quasars , indicating a high column density of gas , either suggesting a star - forming region environment or that the grb occurred in the disk of the galaxy ( or both ) .",
    "the highest redshift absorber is therefore likely the host galaxy of the grb itself @xcite .",
    "in addition two foreground absorbing systems are detected @xcite .",
    "these systems are typical for the metallic line absorbers at comparable redshifts .",
    "further analysis of the two foreground absorbing systems is reported in @xcite and @xcite .",

    "( 2002 ) detected excess submillimeter emission toward grb010222 which they interpret as originating from a starburst host galaxy with sfr@xmath15500 m@xmath16 yr@xmath14 , much of which is obscured at optical wavelengths .",
    "optical observations have been presented by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "although there is good agreement among these authors that the optical light curves exhibit an achromatic break about 0.5 days after the burst , no consensus has been reached regarding the origin of this steepening .",
    "several authors have interpreted the optical afterglow in terms of the standard relativistic blast wave model @xcite . in this case",
    "the break results from a collimated ( jetted ) outflow @xcite ; the synchrotron cooling frequency is below the optical passband and the index @xmath17 of the electron energy distribution is unusually hard , @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "other authors prefer to interpret the break as a dynamical transition to non - relativistic expansion @xcite , requiring a very energetic burst ( @xmath19 erg ) expanding into a dense ( @xmath20 @xmath21 ) circumburst medium .",
    "more recently , bjrnsson et al . (",
    "2002 ) have argued in favor of the jet model but invoke continuous energy injection to explain why the standard model may erroneously be deriving a hard electron energy index .",
    "here we report on _ hubble space telescope _",
    "wfpc2 and stis near - uv mama observations , and ground - based optical observations .",
    "we interpret the resulting lightcurves in the context of a relativistic blast - wave model with a hard electron - energy distribution .",

    "on 2001 feb 26.15 ut , the optical transient ( ot ) was imaged with the _ space telescope imaging spectrograph _ ( stis ) using the near - uv mama and the f25qtz filter .",
    "this filter spans 14503500    ( thus excluding terrestrial airglow lines of ly@xmath22 and ) , but little source flux is expected below the redshifted lyman limit of the ot ( 2253   ) .",
    "we obtained six exposures spanning 2.42  4.64 hours ut , with exposure times of 800866 sec .",
    "the ot was placed near the center of the detector in each exposure , but dithering of 516  pixels placed the ot at a different location in each frame , to smooth over small - scale variations in sensitivity .",
    "the raw stis exposures were reduced using the calstis package of the stis instrument definition team @xcite . using idl , we performed aperture photometry on each frame , assuming a source aperture of 10 pixel radius ( 0.25@xmath23 ) and a sky annulus spanning radii 3050 pixels .",
    "the ot is well detected in each frame , at a signal - to - noise ratio @xmath24 10 .",
    "summing the net counts in each frame and dividing by the total exposure time yields a mean count rate of @xmath25 cts s@xmath14 .",
    "there is no evidence for variability over the two hours of stis exposures ; the count rate measured in each frame scatters within 1@xmath26 around the mean rate . the encircled energy within the source aperture is 0.856 for near - uv mama imaging at these wavelengths @xcite ; with an aperture correction , the measured countrate in the stis bandpass is thus @xmath27 cts s@xmath14 . to convert the stis countrate to flux at a given wavelength requires the assumption of a spectral energy distribution , a discussion of which we present in ",
    "[ sec : mod ]",
    ".    we co - added the individual exposures using the ` drizzle ` package @xcite to determine if other faint objects are visible in the stis image .",
    "the coaddition was done with a mask for hot and bad pixels , and included a correction for the geometric distortion in the stis camera .",
    "three extended objects lie near the ot ; these objects are also well - detected in the wfpc2 images ( see figure [ fig : f606w ] ) .",
    "we performed aperture photometry on these objects assuming a source aperture radius of 50 pixels and a sky annulus spanning 5070 pixels .",
    "the objects are non - circular in shape , but this source aperture encloses the detectable flux from each .",
    "the first source lies 77 s of the ot , and has a count - rate of @xmath28 cts sec@xmath14 ; the second source lies 76 se of the ot , with a count - rate of @xmath29 cts sec@xmath14 ; the third source lies 42 nne of the ot , with a count - rate of @xmath30 cts sec@xmath14 . without any knowledge about the seds , these count rates can not be converted to fluxes accurately , but it is worth noting that in the stis bandpass , these objects are of a brightness comparable to that of the ot .",
    "we obtained _ wide field planetary camera 2 _",
    "( wfpc2 ) hst observations in the f450w , f606w and f814w passbands at four epochs as part of an _ hst _ cycle 9 program .",
    "these observations took place between 2001 february 28.66 ut and may 4.73 ut ( 6.3571.42 days after the grb ) .",
    "the transient was positioned at the wfall position on wfpc2 ccd # 3 .",
    "a log of the observations is provided in table [ tab - hst ] .",
    "the f450w images were combined using the stsdas task ` crrej ` .",
    "the f606w and f814w images at each epoch were observed at two offsets , offset by + 2.5 , + 2.5 pixels in x and y. these images were combined and cosmic - ray rejected using the ` drizzle ` technique @xcite .",
    "the drizzled images have pixels half the area of the original wfpc2 data .",
    "we determined the mag of the optical transient ( ot ) in a 2 pixel aperture radius ( 2.83 pixels for the drizzled images ) and determined the aperture correction from 2 to 5 pixels ( 7.1 pixels for the drizzled images ) to obtain the corresponding 5 pixel radius magnitude .",
    "we corrected the magnitudes for geometric distortion of the images ( @xcite ; a correction of 0.024 magnitudes ) and for non - optimal charge transfer efficiency ( cte ; less than 0.023 magnitudes ) .",
    "next , we calibrated the wfpc2 data using the zeropoints and color transformations to the johnson coussins system in table 10 of @xcite .",
    "these magnitudes are given in table [ tab - hst ] and [ tab - hst2 ] .",
    "the quoted errors are statistical only ; we estimate the uncertainty in the absolute calibration to be about 0.05 in @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the f606w drizzled image of a region around the ot of feb 28.75 ut can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : f606w ] .",
    "the three objects visible in the stis nuv - mama images are also identified in the wfpc2 images although one of the objects falls on the edge of the ccd .",
    "the galaxy 3.96 arcsec north east of the ot is the only one of those three that is displayed .",
    "in addition several other galaxies are seen .",
    "we obtain curves of growth to measure the magnitudes of the host in the wfpc2 images ; correcting for the contribution of the ot and the contribution of the galaxy in a 2 pixel radius ( see  [ sec : mod ] ) , we find @xmath35 = @xmath36 mag , @xmath37 = @xmath38 mag , @xmath39 = @xmath40 mag , and @xmath41 = @xmath42 mag",
    ".    in the final epoch hst images the flux measured at the ot position is dominated by the host galaxy emission .",
    "figure [ fig : psf ] shows the wfpc2 f606w fluxes extracted with increasing apertures , and normalized to unity at 10 , for the host emission ( diamonds ) compared to a reference star ( triangles ) .",
    "the figure shows evidence for a very compact emission component , 3050 % of which can be attributed to the optical transient , and an additional low - level extended emission component .",
    "a cross - correlation of epoch 1 and epoch 6 f606w imaging data allows for us to place the ot position , measured using iraf / center / ofilter in epoch 1 , atop the apparent host galaxy in epoch 6 ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the host center was determined using a centroid algorithm assuming that the light in epoch 6 is dominated by the host .",
    "we determine the offset of the optical transient from the host galaxy to be 42.9 @xmath43 5.6 mas east and 7.8 @xmath43 5.8 mas south , i.e. , a total offset of 43.6 @xmath43 5.6 mas .",
    "this amounts to an offset of 390 @xmath43 51 pc in projection at the redshift of grb 010222 and places the offset of grb 010222 in the 20% percentile of observed grb offsets to - date @xcite .",
    "note , that since the offset is smaller than the resolution of final images , if the ot contributes some of the light to the core of the host in epoch 6 , probably not more than 30% , then the true offset could be larger by not more than a factor of @xmath151.3 .",
    "following the identification of the optical afterglow , we commenced multi - colour observations with the wise observatory 1-m telescope .",
    "the wise observations were made with the site 2k x 4k ccd , using on - chip 2x2 binning , resulting in a pixel scale of 0.8@xmath23/pixel .",
    "the observations lasted until about 3 days after the burst .",
    "observations from the palomar observatory were hampered by poor weather , but we obtained observations 4.2 hours after the event in a sloan @xmath44 filter with the 200-inch hale telescope using the _ large format camera _ ( lfc ) and in b , v , r and i on 2.468 march 2001 ut using the jacobs camera ( jcam ) .",
    "the lfc consists of six 2k@xmath454k site , thinned , backside illuminated ccds , placed in a symmetric cross shaped pattern , providing a roughly 24 arcmin diameter field of view ( fov ) .",
    "jcam is a dual - ccd imager with a 3.2 arcmin diameter fov @xcite .",
    "the observations were reduced in the standard manner , and photometered relative to several field stars calibrated by @xcite . the errors in the table",
    "reflect the statistical and systematic uncertainties , the latter of which were sizable for the jcam and lfc observations because of the lack of suitable secondary standards which did not allow us to fit reliable colour terms .",
    "we therefore photometered the afterglow relative to field stars with colours similar to the ot , without applying any colour correction .",
    "a log of the observations is presented in table [ tab - opt ] .",
    "we suplement the hst wfpc2 and ground - based optical observations from tables [ tab - hst2 ] and [ tab - opt ] with optical and infrared observations from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and with those reported in several grb coordinate network ( gcn ) circulars @xcite .",
    "we restricted the dataset to observations for which magnitudes were reported relative to field stars and converted those to the calibration of @xcite and corrected for a small foreground galactic extinction ( @xmath46 mag from schlegel et al .",
    "the infrared measurements of the ot by @xcite were taken in poor seeing ( 3@xmath474@xmath47 ) , and the authors therefore used an aperture of 5@xmath47 in radius .",
    "keck k - band observations presented in @xcite show that there are several other ( relatively bright ) nir sources nearby . within this aperture",
    "we measure @xmath48 ; very comparable to what is measured by @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the nir measurements of @xcite are severely contaminated ( thus explaining the flat nir light curve ) and we do not include these measurements in our dataset . because the late - time ground - based optical data is also significantly contaminated by the host galaxy we have not included two r - band data points 10 days after grb010222 .",
    "we converted the sloan digital sky survey u@xmath10 , g@xmath10 , i@xmath10 , r@xmath10 , z@xmath10 observations @xcite to u , b , v , r , i using the transformations of @xcite , assuming no fading over the course of the 2.5 m observations ( predicted fading is 0.005 mag , which is negligible ) , and a constant colour for the 1.5-m observations of ( g@xmath10-r@xmath10 ) = 0.28 @xmath43 0.03 mag . an additional 3% transformation error was added in quadrature to the statistical error for these measurements .    in figure",
    "[ fig : opt ] we display the optical light curves .",
    "we have added an additional 0.042 mag error in quadrature , the so - called slop parameter @xmath26 ( see  [ sec : mod ] ) , to reflect uncertainties in the calibration between different instruments .",
    "the magnitudes have been converted to flux densities using the transformations of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the late - time hst ( wfpc2 ) observations show that the optical light curves , after a shallow break around 0.7 days , continue roughly at the same decay rate @xmath49 as previously found by ground - based observations @xcite , and show a leveling off to a constant value in the b , v , r and i band around 25 days ( we can not establish the presence of a host component in the u and infrared passbands due to a lack of late - time observations in those bands ) .",
    "the former has been interpreted as the result of a jet break transition with a very hard electron energy distribution @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the latter is simply interpreted as due to emission from the host galaxy of grb010222 in the 2 pixel radius aperture in which we determined the mag of the ot ( wfpc2 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the source is extended in the wfpc2 images in the later epochs .",
    "therefore we also have to correct the ground - based data for the contribution of the host outside the 2-pixel radius aperture we used for the wfpc2 images .",
    "we determine the difference between a 2 pixel and a large aperture from the hst wfpc2 observations and corrected the ground - based data accordingly .",
    "we now model the optical / nir photometry and stis count rate , and constrain model parameters .",
    "we model the spectrum with a power law that is extinguished by dust in the host galaxy and our galaxy , and absorbed by hydrogen in the host galaxy and ly@xmath50 forest , and we model the light curve with a smooth achromatic , broken power law added to a constant , presumably host galaxy , component : @xmath51^{-1/s}+f_{\\nu}^{host}\\right\\ } , \\label{fnu}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 is the galactic extinction curve model of @xcite , @xmath53 is the ly@xmath50 forest absorption model of @xcite , @xmath54 is the host galaxy extinction curve and lyman limit absorption model of @xcite , @xmath55 is a normalization parameter , @xmath56 is the effective frequency of the r band , @xmath57 is the spectral slope , @xmath58 is the light curve break time , @xmath59 is the break smoothness parameter , @xmath60 is the limiting temporal slope before @xmath58 , @xmath61 is the limiting temporal slope after @xmath58 , and @xmath62 is the spectral flux of the host galaxy at frequency @xmath63 .",
    "the stis bandpass samples 9121400    in the rest - frame , and so h and h@xmath64 absorption lines are expected to be present in the actual flux distribution ; however , a smooth power - law suffices to describe the flux in the broad stis bandpass .",
    "we use the full extinction / absorption model of @xcite , because @xcite find a non - standard extinction curve in the source - frame far ultraviolet ( fuv ; see below ) , and the stis nuv mama transmission function spans the source - frame fuv , ly@xmath50 forest , and lyman limit .    since the source - frame uv extinction curve model has features that are narrower than most photometric bands , we convolve equation ( [ fnu ] ) with a boxcar approximation to the appropriate filter function before fitting it to the optical / nir photometry .",
    "we have found that failure to do this can cause one to erroneously identify lmc- and smc - like extinction curves when an extinction curve with a large fuv excess component , possibly related to the fragmentation of grains by the burst ( see below ) , is actually favored by the data . in the case of the stis measurement , we fit @xmath65 to the measured count rate , where @xmath66 is the collecting area of the mirror , and @xmath67 is the transmission function of the mirror and instrument .    following previous efforts @xcite we chose to fit the data in terms of the standard afterglow model ( _ e.g. , _ sari , piran & narayan 1998 ; sari , piran & halpern 1999 ) .",
    "we do not favor an interpretation in which the break is due to a transition of the blastwave to the non - relativistic phase @xcite .",
    "the same claim has been made for grb000926 @xcite but the high ambient density causes the self - absorption frequency to lie far above the radio passband @xcite resulting in an undetectable radio afterglow , contrary to observations . the jet model with continuous energy injection @xcite is an interesting alternative but",
    "adequate testing of this model will require a full broadband dataset .",
    "a significant difference between our model fit and others is that @xmath60 and @xmath61 are not independent but are in fact directly related to each other by the index @xmath17 of the electron energy distribution .",
    "previous fits to the grb010222 light curves have treated these two parameters as independent ( _ e.g. , _ stanek et al .",
    "we take @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 ( where @xmath17 is the power law index of the electron energy distribution ) , a relation which applies in the standard jet model when the optical band lies above the synchrotron cooling frequency @xcite .",
    "this relation may not be obeyed when @xmath71 @xcite . in order to avoid divergence of the shock energy , an additional cutoff @xmath72 in the electron energy distribution must be introduced . in general this will modify the temporal dependence of the decay indices compared to the @xmath73 case .",
    "however , bhattacharya ( 2001 ) has shown that the behavior is identical when @xmath72 varies in direct proportion to the bulk lorentz factor of the shock .",
    "although this is a reasonable assumption , we note that other solutions are possible depending on what is adopted for the evolution of @xmath72 .",
    "we fit the standard model to the optical / nir photometry and stis nuv mama count rate using bayesian inference ( _ e.g. , _",
    "reichart 2001 ) : the posterior probability distribution is equal to the product of the prior probability distribution and the likelihood function .",

    "many of the parameters of the host galaxy extinction curve model , and all of the parameters of the ly@xmath50 forest absorption model and galactic extinction curve model can be constrained _ a priori_. the host galaxy extinction curve model of @xcite is a function of eight parameters : the source - frame v - band extinction magnitude @xmath83 , @xmath84 , the intercept @xmath85 and slope @xmath86 of the linear component of the source - frame uv extinction curve , the strength @xmath87 , width @xmath88 , and center @xmath89 of the uv bump component of the extinction curve , and the strength @xmath3 of the fuv excess component of the extinction curve .",
    "the ly@xmath50 forest model of @xcite is a function of a single parameter @xmath90 , the flux deficit .",
    "@xcite finds prior probability distributions for @xmath91 , @xmath85 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 , which means that the values of these parameters can be weighted by fairly narrow distributions , the parameterization of which sometimes depends on other parameters ( in particular @xmath86 and @xmath92 ) , _ a priori_. we adopt these priors here , which can be thought of as increasing the degrees of freedom by five . also , the galactic extinction curve model of cardelli , clayton & mathis ( 1989 ) is a function of a single parameter @xmath93 .",
    "we adopt a prior for this parameter that is log - normally distributed with mean @xmath94 and width 0.1 , which closely approximates the distribution of values of this parameter along random lines of sight through the galaxy ( e.g. , reichart 2001 ) .",

    "@xcite suggest that this stronger than expected fuv excess component of the extinction curve might be due to sublimation and fragmentation of circumburst dust ( e.g , waxman & draine 2000 ; galama & wijers 2001 ) : if small ( radius @xmath119 @xmath120 ) graphite grains , which are probably responsible for the fuv excess component of the extinction curve ( e.g. , draine & lee 1984 ) survive in greater numbers than other grains , this value of @xmath3 would not be unexpected .",

    "the quality of the fit is good ( requiring a modest value for the `` slop '' parameter , @xmath26 ) , and indicates that a single value of @xmath17 suffices to describe the observations .",

    "our finding of a steeper decay rate may be caused by : ( i ) our detection of and fitting for a host galaxy contributing to the late - time emission , which suggests that previous work requires a small correction for its contribution , and ( ii ) the jet transition may not have been fully developed yet in the early - time observations presented by previous workers ( resulting in their finding a lower @xmath17 ) . for accurate determination of the physical parameters of the afterglow late - time sensitive observations with hst are of great importance .",
    "our determination of @xmath17 therefore supersedes that of previous work .",

    ". this may be due to dust destruction , where larger grains are preferentially destroyed .",
    "this provides further support for the idea that the early , hard radiation from the grb and its afterglow should destroy dust in the circumburst environment , carving a path out of the molecular cloud through which later afterglow light can travel relatively unobstructed @xcite .",
    "additional observational support for dust destruction comes from the fact that the hydrogen column density is found to be @xmath15 40 - 80 times larger than expected from the observed @xmath83 .",
    "this appears to be a trend in grb afterglows : the column densities are high and found to be typical of galactic giant molecular clouds @xcite , but the optical extinction is found to be small ( factors of 10 - 100 times smaller ) .",

    ", we would expect that grbs occur in dense star - forming regions ; large amounts of optical extinction are then naturally expected but only small amounts are observed @xcite .    on the other hand , early - time keck spectroscopic observations of grb010222 @xcite show a two - component system similar to that of grb000926 @xcite . in grb000926 the two absorption systems have a velocity separation of 168  km  s@xmath14 , which is interpreted as being due to two individual clouds in the host galaxy .",
    "dust destruction by the grb and the afterglow is effective only to @xmath130 pc @xcite from the grb , and it is therefore unlikely that the dust in both clouds would be destroyed .",
    "further , the two clouds appear to have similar relative metal abundance and dust to gas ratio .",
    "castro et al . ( 2002 ) argue that one of the clouds is probably associated with the grb site , and consequently that the burst was ineffective at sublimating dust , in contradiction to theoretical expectations ( e.g. , waxman & draine 2000 ) . in other words , the explanation for the observed low optical extinctions could also be that grb host galaxies typically have low dust to gas ratios ( _ cf .",
    ", _ pettini et al .",
    "this is a simple and attractive explanation , based only on the assumption that the dust to gas ratio was the same for both clouds before the burst occurred .",
    "however , in higher redshift galaxies , such as this one , the dust to gas ratio might only be high in those clouds that are actively producing stars , which is presumably the case at the grb site ( i.e. , dust has not had sufficient time to mix with gas elsewhere in the galaxy ) .",
    "the burst would sublimate this dust , returning the metals to the gas phase , and consequently , similar relative metalicities and dust to gas ratios might also be interpreted as evidence in favor of sublimation .",
