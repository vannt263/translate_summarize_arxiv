    "as a rare example of a class of exactly - solvable , nonequilibrium interacting particle systems , asymmetric simple exclusion processes of various types have found favour with researchers in statistical mechanics , mathematical physics and probability theory @xcite .",
    "these systems comprise hard - core particles hopping in a preferred direction on a one - dimensional lattice and have been used to describe systems as diverse as traffic flow @xcite , the dynamics of ribosomes @xcite and molecular motors @xcite , the flow of hydrocarbons through a zeolite pore @xcite , the growth of a fungal filament @xcite , and in queueing theory @xcite .",
    "the physical interest lies mainly in the rich phase behaviour that arises as a direct consequence of being driven away from equilibrium .    of particular interest",
    "are the open boundary cases . here",
    "the system can be thought of as being placed between two boundary reservoirs , generally of different densities .",
    "the two reservoirs enforce a steady current across the lattice , and therewith a nonequilibrium steady state .",
    "it was first argued by krug @xcite that as the boundary densities are varied nonequilibrium phase transitions may occur in which steady state bulk quantities  such as the mean current or density  exhibit nonanalyticities .",
    "such phase transitions were seen explicitly in first a mean - field approximation @xcite and then in the exact solution @xcite of the totally asymmetric exclusion process with open boundaries , hereafter abbreviated as tasep , and of related processes @xcite . since then arguments have been developed to predict the phase diagram of more general one - dimensional driven diffusive systems @xcite .",
    "our interest in this work is in the distinction between two phase diagrams for the tasep : one of which characterises the steady - state behaviour , and the other the dynamics .",
    "the static phase diagram @xcite is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spd ] where the left boundary density is @xmath0 and the right is @xmath1 .",
    "there are three possible phases in the steady state : a low density ( ld ) phase where the bulk density is controlled by the left boundary and is equal to @xmath0 ; a high density ( hd ) phase where the bulk density is controlled by the right boundary and is equal to @xmath1 ; a maximal current ( mc ) phase where the bulk density is @xmath2 .",
    "the high and low density phases are further divided into subphases ( e.g. ld1 , ldii ) according to the functional form of the spatial decay of the density profile to the bulk value near the non - controlling boundary . in these subphases",
    "the lengthscale over which the decay is observable remains finite as the system size is increased .",
    "this change at the subphase boundaries in the form of the decay is thus not a true phase transition in the thermodynamic sense .",
    "more recently , de  gier and essler have performed an exact analysis of the asep s dynamics @xcite and derived the the longest relaxation times of the system by calculating the gap in the spectrum using the bethe ansatz .",
    "the analysis builds on directly related work on the xxz spin chain with nondiagonal boundary fields @xcite . the dynamical phase diagram",
    "they obtain , in which phases are associated with different functional forms of the longest relaxation time , is illustrated in figure [ fig : dynpd ] .",
    "the same phases ( high density , low density and maximal current ) are found as in the static phase diagram , however , a hitherto unexpected _ dynamical transition _ line which subdivides the low density and high density phases is now apparent .",
    "this line which we shall refer to as the de gier  essler ( dge ) line replaces the subphase boundaries at @xmath3 @xmath4 in the static phase diagram and , for example , subdivides the low density region into ldi@xmath5 , ldii@xmath5 .",
    "although there is nothing to rule out the prediction of dge of a dynamical transition at a distinct location to any static transition , the result came as something of a surprise .",
    "this is because the static phase diagram had been successfully interpreted in terms of an effective , dynamical theory thought to be relevant for late - time dynamics , referred to as domain wall theory ( dwt ) .",
    "we shall review dwt more fully in section  [ subsec : dwt ] . for the moment we note that dwt correctly predicts the static subphase boundary and the associated change in the decay of the density profile , but does not predict the dge line .",
    "therefore , it was previously thought that a dynamical transition also occurred at the subphase boundary and initial calculations of relaxation times appeared to be consistent with this @xcite .",
    "our primary goal in this work is to establish numerically that a dynamical transition does indeed occur along the dge line rather than at the static subphase boundary .",
    "we used two distinct approaches .",
    "first , we carried out direct monte carlo simulations of the tasep dynamics and identified the dominant transient in three time - dependent observables .",
    "we find that these simulations are consistent with a dynamical transition at the dge line but are not sufficiently accurate to rule out the scenario of the dynamical transition occurring at the subphase boundary .",
    "we instead turn to a density matrix renormalisation group ( dmrg ) approach @xcite to acquire convincing evidence that a dynamical transition occurs at the dge line .",
    "the dmrg is an approximate means to obtain the lowest - lying energies and eigenstates of model hamiltonians with short - range interactions .",
    "although originally developed in the context of the hubbard and heisenberg models @xcite ( see also @xcite for a comprehensive review ) , it has also been applied to nonequilibrium processes such as reaction - diffusion models @xcite . in particular , it has also been used to investigate the spectrum of the tasep @xcite . however , the dynamical transition was not evident from the data presented in that work  perhaps because it had not been predicted at that time . by revisiting this approach ,",
    "we obtain estimates of the longest relaxation time that allow us to rule out the domain wall theory prediction for the dynamical transition .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "we begin in section  [ sec : moddef ] by recalling the definition of the tasep , and by reviewing in more detail the static and dynamic phase diagrams discussed above .",
    "then , in section  [ sec : sims ] , we present our monte carlo simulation data , followed by the dmrg results in section  [ sec : dmrg ] . in section  [ sec : discuss ] we return to more general questions about the distinction between the static and dynamic phase diagram with particular reference to different theoretical approaches to the tasep .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : conclude ] with some open questions .",
    "although we have alluded to the basic properties of the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) in the introduction , in the interest of a self - contained presentation we provide in this section a precise model definition and full details of the static and dynamic phase diagrams .",
    "the tasep describes the biased diffusion of particles on a one - dimensional lattice with @xmath6 sites .",
    "no more than one particle can occupy a given site , and overtaking is prohibited .",
    "the stochastic dynamics are expressed in terms of transition rates , for example a particle on a site @xmath7 in the bulk hops to the right as a poisson process with rate @xmath8 , but only if site @xmath9 is unoccupied : at the left boundary only particle influx takes place , with rate @xmath0 , and at the right boundary only particle outflux takes place , with rate @xmath10 , as shown in fig .",

    "arrows show moves that may take place , and the labels indicate the corresponding stochastic rates . ]",
    "as noted in the introduction , the tasep static phase diagram can be determined from , for example , exact expressions for the current and density profile in the steady state @xcite .",
    "the current takes three functional forms according to whether it is limited by a slow insertion rate ( ld : @xmath11 ) , by a slow exit rate ( hd : @xmath12 ) or by the exclusion interaction in the bulk ( mc : @xmath13 ) .",
    "this behaviour of the current leads to the identification of the thermodynamic phases separated by solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : spd ] . along these lines",
    "there are nonanalyticities in both the current and the density far from either boundary .",
    "the relevant expressions for these quantities are shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : spd ] .    the density _ near _ one of the boundaries is nonanalytic along the lines @xmath14 and @xmath15 in the hd and ld phases respectively .",
    "these subphases are shown dotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : spd ] .",
    "inspection of the functional form of the density profile reveals that these are not true thermodynamic phase transitions , in the sense that the deviation from the bulk value extends only a finite distance into the bulk , and thus contributes only subextensively to the nonequilibrium analogue of a free energy ( see e.g. , @xcite for the definition of such a quantity ) . to be more explicit ,",
    "consider for example the behaviour near the right boundary in the low - density phase . here",

    "the mean occupancy of the lattice site positioned a distance @xmath17 from the right boundary approaches in the thermodynamic limit @xmath18 the form @xcite @xmath19^{j } } { j^{3/2 } } & \\frac{1}{2 } < \\beta & \\mbox{(ldii ) } \\end{array}\\right . \\;.\\ ] ] in these expressions , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are functions of the boundary parameters that we leave unspecified here so as to focus on the lengthscale of the exponential decay from the right boundary . as @xmath10 is increased from zero , the decay length increases until @xmath15 .",
    "then the decay length is constant , and the exponential is modulated by a power law .",
    "the density profile at the left boundary exhibits the same kind of nonanalyticity in the high - density phase as @xmath0 is increased through @xmath2 as a consequence of the particle - hole symmetry , @xmath22 , exhibited by the model .",
    "the dynamic phase diagram is obtained by examining a quantity referred to as the _ gap _ by de  gier and essler @xcite .",
    "this is simply the largest nonzero eigenvalue of the transition matrix governing the continuous - time stochastic dynamics of the tasep .",
    "more formally , one starts with the master equation @xmath23 where the matrix @xmath24 encodes the transition rates and @xmath25 is the vector of probabilities for each configuration . because @xmath24 is a stochastic matrix it is guaranteed @xcite by the perron - frobenius theorem to have eigenvalues satisfying @xmath26 the spectrum corresponds to a set of relaxation times @xmath27 .",
    "the longest ( non - infinite ) relaxation time is @xmath28 , and the associated eigenvalue @xmath29 is the gap which we will henceforth denote by the symbol @xmath30 . at long times",
    "the relaxation of any observable is expected to decay exponentially with a characteristic timescale @xmath28 , a fact we will later use to estimate the gap from monte carlo simulations .",
    "the thermodynamic phase boundaries are found by identifying lines along which the gap vanishes , indicating the coexistence of two stationary eigenstates ( phases ) .",
    "the exact calculations of de  gier and essler @xcite show that , in the thermodynamic limit @xmath18 , the gap vanishes along the line @xmath31 that separates the hd and ld phases .",
    "the gap also vanishes in the entirety of the mc phase , reflecting the generic long - range ( power - law ) correlations seen in this phase @xcite .",
    "thus at this level , the static and dynamic phase diagrams coincide .",
    "where they differ is in the subdivision of the high- and low - density phases , in which the gap remains finite in the limit @xmath18 .",
    "there is a region , marked ldi@xmath5 and hdi@xmath5 on fig .",
    "[ fig : dynpd ] , within which the gap assumes the asymptotic expression @xmath32 in which @xmath33 within the low - density phase ( @xmath34 ) , this form of the gap applies for values of @xmath35 where @xmath36^{-1 } \\;.\\ ] ] likewise , in the high - density phase ( @xmath37 ) , the region within which the gap is given by ( [ eq : gap_mi ] ) is bounded by @xmath38 where @xmath39^{-1 } \\;.\\ ] ] in the remainder of the low - density phase , @xmath40 the gap takes the form @xmath41 finally , we have by symmetry that when @xmath42 , @xmath43 in these expressions , @xmath44 the boundaries between the dynamic subphases  the de  gier  essler ( dge ) lines  are shown dotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : dynpd ] .",
    "note that the coefficient of the @xmath45 term in this asymptotic expansion is discontinuous across the dynamical transition line .    in order to illustrate the behaviour of the gap along the static and dynamic transition lines , we plot it as a function of @xmath10 at some @xmath46 in fig .  [",
    "fig : degiergapinf ] .",
    "the most striking feature is the constancy of the gap above the nontrivial critical point @xmath47 . later in this work",

    "although much simpler than the bethe ansatz approach of de  gier and essler , it correctly predicts the static phase boundaries and the analytical form of the gap in a region of the phase diagram .",
    "however , it predicts dynamic subphases that are distinct from those found by de  gier and essler , and that correspond to the static subphases . in the numerical study that follows",
    ", it will be important to be able to distinguish between these two sets of predictions , and so we summarise dwt here .",
    "the basis of this approach is to assume that collective relaxational dynamics are effectively reducible to a single coordinate describing the position of an interface , or domain wall .",
    "the wall separates a domain of density @xmath52 and current @xmath53 to the left from a domain of density @xmath54 and current @xmath55 to the right .",
    "each domain is taken to possess the steady state characteristics imposed by the boundary reservoir on that particular side of the wall , with @xmath54 and @xmath52 therefore as in fig .",
    "[ fig : dwtphasediagram ] .",
    "the effective theory is expected to be exact along the line @xmath56 where the exact properties of the system such as density profile @xcite and current fluctuations @xcite are recovered .",
    "the phase diagram obtained from domain wall theory . @xmath57 and @xmath58 indicate the densities of the left and right domains . in the domain wall theory ,",
    "static and dynamic transitions coincide along the dashed lines . ]",
    "let us consider the case @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the motion of the wall is then described microscopically as a random walker with left and right hopping rates @xmath61 and @xmath62 given respectively by imposing mass conservation on the fluxes into and out of the wall @xcite : @xmath63 for @xmath64 the random walk is biased to the left and in the stationary state the domain wall is localised at the left boundary and the bulk density is given by @xmath65 . for @xmath66 the random walk is biased to the right and in the stationary state the domain wall is localised at the right boundary and the bulk density is given by @xmath67 .",
    "thus the first order transition at @xmath68 is correctly predicted .",
    "moreover , the gap in the resulting spectrum for large @xmath6 given @xcite is given by @xmath69 remarkably this expression is identical to ( [ eq : gap_mi ] ) to order @xmath70 .",
    "thus in the region @xmath71 dwt correctly predicts the gap .",
    "when @xmath72 so that @xmath73 , one can take @xmath74 in ( [ d+d- ] ) to depend on the size @xmath75 of the right - hand domain .",
    "that is , one puts @xmath76 equal to the stationary current in a tasep of size @xmath75 in the maximal current phase .",
    "this implies the large @xmath75 behaviour @xmath77 this results in a modification of the density profile to an exponential spatial decay modulated by a power law with power 3/2 , similar to eq .",
    "[ eq : rhold ] ( ldii ) .    in brief ,",
    "the dwt is remarkably successful , correctly predicting the static phase diagram ( including subphases ) , and the exact thermodynamic gap function found by de  gier and essler in the region @xmath78 and @xmath60 .",
    "it differs in that the dynamic subphases are not given by the dge lines , but the static subphase transition lines .",
    "thus , the region within which the gap is constant is different in the two theories , as indicated by fig .",

    "we now describe attempts to measure the gap in monte carlo simulations of the tasep , with a particular interest in distinguishing between the dge and dwt predictions . as noted previously , the ensemble average of any time - dependent observable @xmath82 should be dominated at late times by an exponential decay @xmath83 to its stationary value @xmath84 .",
    "recall that @xmath29 is the largest nonzero eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath24 appearing in the master equation ( [ eq : me ] ) , and that all nonstationary eigenvalues have negative real part . in principle , therefore , all one needs to do is pick an observable , and measure its late - time decay rate . in practice",
    ", this is made difficult by the fact that _ all _ decay modes may contribute to @xmath85 , and that by the time the higher modes have decayed away , the residual signal @xmath86 may be extremely small and swamped by the noise .",
    "since we are interested in the time - dependence of an observable , we employ a _ continuous - time _ ( gillespie ) algorithm @xcite to simulate the tasep dynamics .",
    "more precisely , we maintain a list of events ( i.e. , a particle hopping to the next site , or entering or leaving the system ) that can take place given the current lattice configuration . a particular event @xmath7 is then chosen with a probability proportional to its rate @xmath87 as specified in section  [ sec : moddef ]",
    ". a time variable is then incremented by an amount chosen from an exponential distribution with mean @xmath88 . in this way",
    ", a member of the ensemble of all continuous - time trajectories of the tasep dynamics from some prescribed initial condition is generated with the appropriate probability .",
    "we consider first the decay of the total number of particles on the lattice , @xmath89 , to its stationary value as measured by the function @xmath90 in this expression , angle brackets denote an average over an ensemble of initial conditions and over stochastic trajectories . in each simulation run",
    ", an initial condition was constructed in which each site was independently occupied with a probability @xmath91 ( in the ld phase ) or @xmath92 ( in the hd phase ) . in the bulk , these densities then relax to the steady - state values displayed on fig .",

    "the start and end points of this windows are both crucial .",
    "if it starts too early , then one may expect contributions from subdominant transients ( i.e. , the decays at rate @xmath94 ) to systematically skew the estimate of the gap .",

    "strong deviations from unity indicate the dominance of noise , and we rejected points after which the magnitude of this ratio exceeded a critical value . for our data sets , we found that @xmath99 was a suitable choice for this value : see fig .",

    "the bottom end of the window was chosen by maximising a goodness - of - fit measure to a fit of the exponential @xmath100 to data points within the window .",

    "this goodness - of - fit measure trades off the increased quality of the fit obtained by discarding data points against the increasing uncertainty in the fitting parameters that comes with the noisier data at the top end of the window .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : r2mc ] an example of how the goodness - of - fit varies with the size of the window .",
    "we remark that the relative flatness of @xmath107 above the optimal starting time can be ascribed to the fact that only a single decay mode remains in this region .",
    "although this procedure is a little cumbersome to apply to each data set , we found it preferable to fitting multiple exponentials to the data for @xmath93 , which leads to large uncertainties in the measured gap .",

    "given the difficulties in measuring the gap from monte carlo simulations , we now turn to a fundamentally different numerical approach , namely the density matrix renormalisation group ( dmrg ) @xcite that was briefly discussed in the introduction .",
    "we begin by recapitulating the essential features of the dmrg approach before demonstrating that it does indeed show a dynamical transition along the de  gier  essler line .",
    "the density matrix renormalisation group ( dmrg ) procedure builds an approximation to the transition matrix @xmath24 that appears in the master equation ( [ eq : me ] ) .",
    "the basic idea is to repeatedly add sites to the system and renormalise the enlarged transition matrix so that its dimensionality remains constant as the system size grows . in this way",
    ", the approximated transition matrix remains sufficiently small that its spectrum ( and in particular the gap ) can be determined using standard numerical diagonalisation methods .",
    "the success of this procedure relies on finding a reduced basis set at each renormalisation step that allows the lowest - lying eigenstates to remain well approximated as sites are added .",
    "since the tasep has open boundaries , the extension of the lattice is achieved in this instance by adding sites to the _ middle _ of the system rather than at one of the ends @xcite .",
    "the system is thus divided into two ` blocks ' : the left and right halves of the lattice .",
    "it is extended in each iteration by adding a site at the right - hand end of the left block , and the left - hand end of the right block . in order to understand the results that come out of the procedure",
    ", it is worth explaining in a little more detail how the renormalisation is actually achieved ",

    "the set of states the block can be in is specified by two ` quantum ' numbers , @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "the quantity @xmath128 indexes the configuration of the first @xmath129 sites , and @xmath130 the occupancy of the rightmost site .",
    "the first step of the renormalisation is to construct some basis in the @xmath131-dimensional space spanned by @xmath128 and @xmath130 and , crucially , retain only @xmath132 of these basis vectors .",
    "this defines a renormalised index @xmath133 for the _ entire _",

    "the configuration of this additional site is specified by the renormalised coordinate @xmath134 .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : dmrgstep ] .",
    "the reason for keeping the rightmost site in the ` physical ' ( site occupancy ) basis is that one needs to project the transition matrix for hops from site @xmath75 to @xmath135 onto the space spanned by @xmath136 and @xmath134 .",
    "these transition rates are initially only known in this physical basis .",
    "thus through this procedure , we obtain a ( truncated ) representation of the transition matrix for an @xmath135-site system in a space of the same dimensionality as that used to describe the @xmath75-site system .",

    "this transition matrix is then diagonalised .",
    "however , it is not these eigenstates that are used to perform the renormalisation .",
    "rather , a _ density matrix _ , which is a symmetric combination of the two longest - lived eigenstates of @xmath140 , is constructed , and eigenvectors of this density matrix are instead used for the renormalisation .",
    "the idea is that this form of the density matrix allows the stationary and longest - lived transient state to be accurately represented in large systems .",

    "for further details about the principles behind dmrg and other applications we refer to @xcite , and especially @xcite .",
    "we used the dmrg algorithm outlined above to estimate the gap for a given combination of @xmath0 and @xmath10 by starting with an exact diagonalisation of the @xmath142 system , and keeping @xmath143 eigenvectors of the density matrix in each renormalisation step . in principle , one ought to be able to access arbitrarily large system sizes with this method . in practice  and as was also noted in @xcite  the algorithm eventually goes unstable , which is typically manifested through the gap acquiring an imaginary part .",
    "we simply ignore data for system sizes where the instability is judged to have kicked in .    although we can access larger system sizes with the dmrg approach than was possible with monte carlo ( e.g. , @xmath6 up to about 250 , as shown in fig .",

    "for comparison , de gier and essler predict a constant value for the gap of @xmath149 above the dynamical transition , while domain wall theory predicts @xmath150 .",
    "the dmrg measurement is then clearly consistent with the de  gier  essler prediction , whilst the difference from the domain wall theory value is significant . taking this result together with the monte carlo data we conclude that a dynamical transition does indeed occur at the dge line , and not where dwt predicts .     at @xmath151 ( for which @xmath152 ) . ]",
    "in this paper we have presented numerical evidence , the most convincing of which came from dmrg calculations , that a dynamical transition occurs in the tasep at the dge line rather than at the subphase boundary .",

    "for example , does the dge line  and in particular its departure from the static subphase boundary  have any physical significance ?",
    "how is the static subphase boundary manifested in the eigenvalue spectrum ?",
    "we discuss the distinction between the two phase diagrams first in general theoretical terms , and then with reference to different treatments of the tasep .",

    "we see from ( [ z ] ) that to obtain a static phase transition we require a major restructuring of the eigenvalue spectrum . to be general and explicit",
