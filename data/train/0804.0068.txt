    "it is generally recognized today that macroscopic behavior of a nucleus at excitation of giant resonances of multipole degree @xmath0 located lower than the compressional giant monopole and the giant dipole resonances bears strong resemblance to elastic shear ( non - compressional ) oscillations of a solid globe .",
    "such an understanding , prompted long ago by work of bertsch @xcite , has come into existence during the past three decades as a result of numerous investigations clearly indicating that macroscopic description of giant - resonant nuclear response in terms of shear oscillations of an elastic sphere provides proper account of experimentally observed size effect ",

    "this feature is generally thought of as exhibiting fundamental character of nuclear giant - resonant response @xcite . in this latter context , a great deal of current interest centers on the electric pigmy dipole resonance ( pdr ) which is observed by the nuclear resonance fluorescence ( nrf ) technique as a concentration of electric dipole strength near the neutron threshold ( e.g. [ 4 - 16 ] and references therein ) , that is , in the energy domain where nuclear resonance - like excitations exhibit features generic to shear oscillations of an elastic sphere .",

    "it is tempting to consider the available experimental data on the low - energy electric pdr in the context of above predictions of the core - layer model for the energy and excitation strength of the dipole soft mode . by varying parameter @xmath48",

    "a special comment that deserves to be made is that the difference between proposed elastodynamic excitation mechanism of the electric pdr implying the isoscalar nature of this soft mode and the hydrodynamic mechanism lying at the base of isovector macroscopic model @xcite from the standpoint of which the electric pdr is thought of as low - frequency counterpart of giant dipole resonance . in calculations reported in @xcite",
    "the low - energy dipole resonant mode arises as a solution of fairly sophisticated equations describing oscillations of relative neutron - proton density driven by restoring force defined as gradient of symmetry energy and , thus , implying the isovector type and compressional character of material oscillations . in the meantime , numerous theoretical investigations of nuclear giant resonances by macroscopic methods of the theory of material continua , developed over the past three decades , unambiguously indicate that excitation of compression nuclear vibrations demands much more energy of electromagnetic perturbation than that goes to excitation of the electric pygmy dipole resonance .",
    "the line of argument presented above shows that the electric pdr emerges as a soft dipole mode of elastic shear oscillations of irrotational flow which turn out to be confined in the finite - depth surface layer .",
    "these two signatures are the main features distinguishing the low - energy electric pdr from the electric toroid - dipole resonant ( tdr ) mode centered at @xmath83 mev [ 27 - 33 ] .",
    "the characteristic peculiarities of tdr mode ( considered in @xcite on the same physical footing , that is , as driven by restoring force of shear elastic distortions ) is that in this latter case a nucleus responds by oscillations of rotational , i.e. vortical , flow with the torus - like shape of the flow lines and such oscillations are excited in the whole volume of nucleus .",
    "it is noteworthy that based on arguments similar to expanded above , in refs.@xcite it was shown that magnetic dipole resonance ( mdr ) , experimentally detected by nrf technique as well @xcite , can also be interpreted as a result of perturbation - induced core - layer decomposition of nucleus , but accompanied by differentially rotational , torsional , elastic oscillations of peripheral layer relative to static core , as pictured in fig.6 . to this end",
    ", it worth emphasizing that macroscopic elastodynamic treatment of low - frequency dipole nuclear resonant excitations provides a remarkable way of unifying understanding of the electric pygmy dipole resonance and magnetic dipole resonance as soft modes of differentially translational ( pdr ) and differentially rotational ( mdr ) elastic oscillations of the finite - depth layer against static core , respectively , the oscillations driven by one and the same restoring force of shear deformations .",
    "this point of view is strengthened by unified elastodynamic interpretation of isoscalar electric @xmath5 and magnetic @xmath84 giant resonances of multipole degree @xmath0 in terms of two fundamental , spheroidal and torsional , vibrational modes in a viscoelastic sphere , excited in the entire nucleus volume : the electric giant resonances are treated as even parity spheroidal ( shake ) mode of nodeless elastic shear oscillations with frequency @xmath34 of irrotational vector field of material displacements and the magnetic giant resonances as odd - parity torsional ( twist ) mode of nodeless shear oscillations with frequency @xmath85 of differentially rotational vector field of material displacements , respectively , as pictured in fig.7 .",

    "the obtaining of such information has been and still is among the main purposes of macroscopic modeling of nuclear giant resonance in terms of vibrations of an ultra small mass of nuclear continuous medium . from identification of theoretically computed energy of spheroidal quadrupole vibrational state with experimental energy of giant @xmath93 resonance , taken from @xcite",
    ", it follows @xmath94 dyn @xmath95 .",
    "the fact that predictions of the model fairly accurately match the data on @xmath96 ( from @xcite ) and @xmath97 ( from @xcite ) with no use of any adjustable constants , as one can see in fig.7 , lends strong support to elastodynamical macroscopic mechanism of excitation of isoscalar giant resonances .",
    "also it seems appropriate to add that a similar line of argument has been utilized to extract the shear viscosity @xmath92 of nuclear matter from systematic data on spread width of giant resonances and the work of hasse @xcite is among the first to point out that such procedure leads to @xmath98 dyn sec @xmath95 ( see , for detail , @xcite ) .",

    "such vibrations are detected as quasi - periodic oscillations of electromagnetic emission from these cosmic nuclear matter objects exhibiting similar elastodynamical pattern of their vibrational behavior ( e.g. [ 43 - 45 ] and references therein ) .",
