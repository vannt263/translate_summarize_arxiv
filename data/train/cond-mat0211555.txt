    "namely , that the steady - state currents exist in one of three regimes , high density ( with currents determined by the exit rate ) , low density ( with currents determined by the particle entrance rate ) , and the maximal current phase ( with current determined by the interior hopping rate ) .    in the following section , we consider a simple mean field theory that does not explicitly take into account the infinitely repulsive interactions of the large particles .",
