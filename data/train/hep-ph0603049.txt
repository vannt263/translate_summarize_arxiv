    "an important feature of mssm is that , for large values of @xmath2 , the yukawa couplings of the @xmath1-quarks to the neutral higgs bosons @xmath3 ( where @xmath4 , @xmath5 , or @xmath6 ) are strongly enhanced compared to the sm @xmath7 yukawa coupling .",
    "consequently , production of supersymmetric higgs bosons in @xmath8 fusion can have a large cross section in supersymmetric extensions of the standard model @xcite .",
    "the partonic processes contributing to the inclusive higgs boson production with enhanced @xmath9 coupling are represented by ( a ) @xmath10 ; ( b ) @xmath11 ; and ( c ) @xmath12 scattering . the three processes ( a",
    ", b , c ) all give rise to the same hadronic final states , with two @xmath13-mesons appearing in different , but overlapping , regions of phase space .",
    "the distinction between the three processes depends very much on the factorization scheme adopted for the qcd calculation , as has been recently reviewed in ref .",
    "the @xmath3@xmath14 processes have been extensively studied recently in sm and mssm scenarios  @xcite .    as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , the correct model for the transverse momentum distribution of the higgs boson is crucial for unambiguous reconstruction of the higgs boson mass in the @xmath15 decay channel .",
    "it is also important for discriminating the signal events from the backgrounds by examining the @xmath0 distribution of the higgs boson in @xmath16 associated production , followed by @xmath17 decay  @xcite .",

    "the large discrepancy between the two curves is in contrast to the case of @xmath24 and @xmath83 production via light - quark scattering , where the above two calculations predict similar , though not identical , @xmath0 distributions  @xcite .",
    "a closer examination reveals that additional features must be implemented in the resummed cross section in order to reliably describe the @xmath0 distributions of higgs bosons produced via @xmath8 fusion .",
    "* the kinematical effects account for a large part of the disparity between @xmath77 and pythia .",
    "the bottom - quark pdf is a rapidly decreasing function of @xmath69 in the probed range of @xmath69 .",
    "consequently , approximations for the true partonic kinematics ( especially those made for the light - cone momentum fractions @xmath69 ) may have a strong impact on the rate of @xmath8 scattering .",
    "this feature should be contrasted to the behavior of the light - quark pdf s in @xmath24 and @xmath83 production , which include a substantial valence component and vary slower with @xmath69 . as a result , the kinematical approximations are less consequential in the @xmath24 and @xmath83 case .",
    "+   + when pythia generates qcd radiation , the kinematical distributions of the final - state particles , including the quarks and gluons from the qcd showering , are modified to satisfy energy - momentum conservation at each stage of the showering . in the resummation calculation ,",
    "information about the exact parton kinematics is included in the finite - order term ( pert ) .",
    "the resummed cross section is therefore expected to be closer to pythia once the @xmath49 finite term , pert(1)-asy(1 ) , is included . in the @xmath77 calculation ,",
    "the emitted gluons are assumed not to carry any momentum at all in the soft limit . to compensate for small , but nonzero energy of the soft gluon emissions , we introduce a `` kinematical correction '' ( kc ) in the w and asy terms .",
    "this correction modifies the minimal values of partonic momentum fractions @xmath84 and @xmath85 in order to account for reduction of phase space available for collinear qcd radiation at large @xmath0 .",
    "* the lowest - order cross section @xmath77 does not evaluate effects of the bottom - quark mass , which is first included in the @xmath74-function of order @xmath81 .",
    "also , additional , though not complete , @xmath86 contributions arise in the sudakov form factors inside pythia when the next - to - leading order pdf s are used . to account for both features ,",
    "we evaluate the @xmath24 term at one higher order ( 2,2,1 ) and include the @xmath18 dependence using the css - hq scheme .",
    "( a)(b )    thus , our full prediction tot(1 ) is obtained by adding @xmath87(2,2,1 ) ( evaluated in the css - hq formalism with the kinematical correction ) and pert(1 ) , and subtracting @xmath88(1 ) . it is shown for @xmath89  gev at the tevatron in fig .",

    "in the large @xmath0 region , the tot(1 ) rate is larger than the pythia rate .    finally , fig .",
    "[ fig : four ] shows the integrated cross section as a function of the minimal @xmath0 in the calculation for the tevatron ( left ) and lhc ( right ) .",
    "this is another way to illustrate the differences in the shapes of @xmath0 distributions obtained in the resummation , fixed - order , and pythia calculations .",
    "multiple parton radiation in @xmath1-quark scattering is conspicuously sensitive to effects of large bottom - quark mass @xmath18 and phase - space constraints on collinear emissions . both @xmath18 dependence and phase - space dependence tangibly",
