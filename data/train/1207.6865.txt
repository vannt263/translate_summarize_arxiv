    "let @xmath0 be a @xmath1-dimensional _ lattice polytope _ in @xmath2 ; that is , @xmath0 is the convex hull of finitely many points in @xmath3 . further , let @xmath4 be a triangulation of  @xmath0 .",
    "we call @xmath4 _ dense _ if the points @xmath5 are precisely the vertices of  @xmath4 . moreover , we call @xmath4 _ foldable _ if its dual graph is bipartite ; equivalently , the vertices of the @xmath6-skeleton considered as an abstract graph is @xmath7-colorable @xcite . in this case we may distinguish between `` black '' and `` white '' @xmath1-dimensional cells of  @xmath4 . the _ signature _ @xmath8 is defined as the absolute value of the difference of the numbers of black and of white @xmath1-dimensional cells of @xmath4 that have odd normalized volume . the _ normalized volume _ of @xmath0 equals @xmath9 times the euclidean volume of @xmath0 . as @xmath0 is a lattice polytope",
    "the normalized volume is an integer .",
    "soprunova and sottile  @xcite prove that @xmath8 is a lower bound for the number of real roots of so - called `` wronski systems '' of @xmath1 polynomials over the reals in @xmath1 unknowns associated with @xmath0 and @xmath4 . for @xmath10 that result amounts to the basic fact that every univariate real polynomial of odd degree has at least one real zero . in general , the signature @xmath8 can be interpreted as the topological degree of the map which `` folds '' the foldable triangulation  @xmath4 onto the standard simplex of the same dimension ; see @xcite and the references given there . in various cases the soprunova  sottile bound is sharp for generic coefficients . here",
    "we are concerned with the planar case @xmath11 , where we provide a new lower bound for the signature , and then an explicit example of a wronski system for which the bound is sharp .    in the literature foldable abstract simplicial complexes",
    "are also called `` balanced '' ; for instance , see @xcite .",
    "let @xmath12 and @xmath13 be lattice points in @xmath14 .",
    "we say that the line segment @xmath15=\\operatorname{conv}\\{p , q\\}$ ] is _ of  type  @xmath16 _ if the first coordinate of @xmath17 is odd and the other one is even . similarly , the segment is _ of  type  @xmath18 _ if the second coordinate is odd and the other one is even . for a segment _ of  type  @xmath19 _",
    "both coordinates are odd .",
    "the key to our main result is the following observation .",
    "[ lemma1 ] let @xmath20 be a lattice triangle of odd normalized area in the plane",
    ". then @xmath20 has precisely one edge of type  @xmath16 , one of type  @xmath18 and one of type  @xmath19 .",
    "up to a translation we can assume that the vertices of @xmath20 are @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 with @xmath24 .",
    "then the normalized area of  @xmath20 is given by the absolute value of the determinant @xmath25 and our precondition says that this is odd .",
    "it follows that the parities of the two products @xmath26 and @xmath27 are distinct .",
    "after possibly exchanging the vertices @xmath22 and @xmath23 we may assume that @xmath26 is odd , and thus both @xmath28 and @xmath1 are odd .",
    "if both @xmath29 and @xmath30 are even then the edge @xmath31 $ ] is of type  @xmath16 , the edge @xmath32 $ ] is of type  @xmath18 , and the third edge @xmath33 $ ] is of type  @xmath19 .",

    "the situation is similar if @xmath29 is even and @xmath30 is odd .",
    "the preceding lemma admits the following generalization .",
    "let @xmath20 be an arbitrary lattice triangle .",
    "then the normalized area of @xmath20 is congruent modulo @xmath34 to the number of edges of type @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is any type .",
    "we omit the proof , which is similar to the above .",
    "now let @xmath11 and let @xmath0 be a lattice polygon with a dense and foldable triangulation  @xmath4 . for @xmath37 foldable triangulations",
    "can also be characterized by the fact that all interior vertices of its graph have even degree .",
    "( indeed , the interesting case is @xmath11 , as for @xmath10 all triangulations are foldable . )",
    "it  is also special to dimensions @xmath37 that a triangulation is dense if and only if it is unimodular , that is , each triangle has normalized area one .",
    "as  @xmath4 is foldable we may distinguish between `` black '' and `` white '' triangles .",
    "we can also assign colors , either black or white , to the boundary edges of a foldable triangulation , according to the color of the unique triangle they are contained in .",

    "let @xmath0 be a lattice polygon with a dense and foldable triangulation @xmath4 .",

    "choosing @xmath77 and @xmath78 as coefficient vectors we obtain the wronski system @xmath79 of bivariate polynomial equations .",
    "the real conic defined by the first polynomial is a hyperbola , the second one defines an ellipse ; see figure  [ fig : curves ] .",
    "the normalized area of @xmath0 is four and so , by kushnirenko s theorem , the polynomial system has exactly four complex solutions ( the coefficients _ are _ sufficiently generic ) .",

    "it is instructive to look at the case @xmath10 .",
    "if @xmath80 is a univariate real polynomial with non - vanishing constant coefficient its @xmath6-dimensional newton polytope is the interval from @xmath81 to the degree of @xmath80 .",
    "its normalized volume is the length of the interval , which equals the degree . if the coefficients of @xmath80 are sufficiently generic there are degree many complex roots . in this sense kushnirenko s theorem",
    "generalizes the fundamental theorem of algebra . to obtain a lower bound for the number of _ real _ roots of @xmath80 , consider the unique dense triangulation of the interval @xmath82 $ ] into unit intervals",
    "this is clearly foldable , and its signature is the parity of the degree .",
    "this means that the result by soprunova and sottile generalizes the well known fact that a univariate real polynomial of odd degree has at least one real root ."
