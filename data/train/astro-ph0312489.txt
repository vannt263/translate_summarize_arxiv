    "constructing self - consistent collisionless equilibrium models is a key step to understand the structure and the dynamics of stellar systems .",
    "the construction process usually starts with the assignment of a phase - space distribution function ( df ) obeying the jeans theorem ( and thus a solution of the collisionless boltzmann equation that describes such `` gravitational plasma '' ) , which leads to an expression for the density as a function of the potential ; models are then calculated by solving the poisson equation , as a non - linear , second - order partial differential equation for the potential . in the presence of special symmetries ( for example , in the case of spherical models ) the problem can be reduced to the study of an ordinary differential equation , and the model construction is relatively straightforward . for more general symmetries",
    "the procedure is inherently difficult . in general",
    ", solutions have to be found numerically and turn out to exist only for a finite range of the parameters appearing in the adopted df .    here",
    "we present the basic properties of the simplest member of a new family of dfs that are able to generate axisymmetric , truncated ( i.e. , finite size ) stellar dynamical models characterized by _ toroidal _ shapes .",
    "the complete description of our family of dfs , together with the results of n - body simulations aimed at the study of the _ stability _ of these collisionless equilibrium configurations , will be presented in a separate paper ( ciotti , bertin , londrillo 2004 ) .",
    "we recall that toroidal , self - consistent models are sometimes mentioned in the literature ( e.g. , see lynden - bell 1962 ; the author expressed concerns about their stability ) . with our models",
    "we will investigate this matter further , also considering the possible stabilizing effect of a massive dark matter halo .",
    "astrophysical applications will address the modeling of _ peanut - shaped _ bulges ( e.g. , see aronica et al .",
    "2003 , and references therein ) and the problem of the _ central depression _ recently discovered ( lauer et al .",
    "2002 ) in the luminosity profiles of some elliptical galaxies hosting supermassive black holes .",
    "the particular set of axisymmetric models presented here is defined by the df @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a ( dimensional ) physical scale , @xmath2 , @xmath3 is the heaviside step function , and @xmath4 and @xmath5 are two dimensionless constants ; the natural coordinates are cylindrical , @xmath6 . in addition",
    ", @xmath7 is the binding energy per unit mass , @xmath8 is the axial component of the angular momentum ( per unit mass ) , and @xmath9 and @xmath10 are a _ truncation energy _ and an _ anisotropy radius _ , respectively .",
    "the function @xmath11 represents the total gravitational potential ; for the moment , we only require that @xmath12 for @xmath13 , where @xmath14 .",
    "we allow for an external component also , i.e. , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the potential associated with the density distribution derived from eq .",

    "note that we can write @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the square of the meridional ( or poloidal ) velocity component .",
    "some dynamical properties of the systems associated with eq .",
    "( 1 ) are the following : @xmath20 no net rotation is present , and @xmath21 the two components @xmath22 and @xmath23 of the velocity dispersion tensor are equal . in addition , note that for @xmath24 if we formally consider @xmath25 we recover the polytropic spheres , while for integer @xmath4 and @xmath5 the distribution function is a _ sum _ of fricke s ( 1952 ) dfs .",
    "the functional dependence of the system structural and dynamical properties on @xmath26 is obtained by integration over @xmath27 , the velocity section of phase  space over which @xmath28 at given @xmath29 .",
    "the coordinates @xmath30 to be used to integrate the various quantities over the rotationally symmetric ( ellipsoidal ) region @xmath27 are naturally defined by @xmath31 where @xmath32 , @xmath33 . with this choice",
    ", the ellipsoidal radius @xmath34 of the velocity section @xmath35 runs in the range @xmath36}$ ] .",
    "integration over the two angular coordinates gives @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the euler beta function , @xmath39 and for convergence it is required that @xmath40 , @xmath41 .",
    "moreover , @xmath42 and @xmath43 the number of free parameters ( excluding those associated with the external potential ) needed to describe a model completely is five : the three dimensional quantities @xmath1 , @xmath10 , and @xmath9 , and the two dimensionless constants @xmath4 and @xmath5 . the relation between the meridional velocity dispersion @xmath44 and the azimuthal ( toroidal ) velocity dispersion @xmath45 , can be described by the anisotropy distribution @xmath46 the velocity dispersion tensor is isotropic when @xmath47 , tangentially anisotropic when @xmath48 , and meridionally anisotropic when @xmath49 . note that the velocity dispersion anisotropy is constant on _ cylinders_. it can be proved that eq .",

    "( 9 ) , the poisson equation is first recast in dimensionless form , by referring to the physical scales @xmath10 for lengths and @xmath9 for potentials .",
