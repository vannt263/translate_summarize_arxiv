    "the design of computational methods for the numerical approximation of the stokes system of equations modelling creeping incompressible flow is by and large well understood in the case where the underlying problem is well - posed .",
    "indeed , provided suitable boundary conditions are set , the system of equations are known to satisfy the hypotheses of the lax - milgram lemma and brezzi s theorem ensuring well - posedness of velocities and pressure .",
    "these theoretical results then underpin much of the theory for the design of stable and accurate finite element methods for the stokes system @xcite .    in many cases of interest in applications , however , the necessary data for the theoretical results to hold are not known ; this is the case for instance in data assimilation in atmospheric sciences or oceanography . instead of knowing the solution on the boundary",
    ", data in the form of measured values of velocities may be known in some other set .",
    "it is then not obvious how best to apply the theory developed for the well - posed case .",
    "a classical approach is to rewrite the system as an optimisation problem and add some regularization , making the problem well - posed on the continuous level and then approximate the well - posed problem using known techniques . for examples of methods using this framework see @xcite and @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we advocate a different approach in the spirit of @xcite .",
    "the idea is to formulate the optimization problem on the continuous level , but without any regularization .",
    "we then discretize the ill - posed continuous problem and instead regularize the discrete solution .",
    "this leads to a method in the spirit of stabilized finite element methods where the properties of the different stabilizing operators are well studied .",
    "an important feature of this approach is that it eliminates the need for a perturbation analysis on the continuous level taking into account the tikhonov regularization and perturbations in data , that the discretization error then has to match . in our case",
    "we are only interested in the discretization error and the perturbations in data .",
    "this allows us to derive error estimates that are optimal in the case of unperturbed data in a similar fashion as for the well - posed case .",
    "we exemplify the theory in a model case for data assimilation where data is given in some subset of the computational domain instead of the boundary , and we obtain error estimates using a conditional stability result in the form of a three ball inequality due to lin , uhlmann , and wang @xcite . a particular feature of the method formulated for the integration of data in the bulk ( and not on the boundary )",
    ", is that the dual adjoint problem does not require any regularization on the discrete level .",
    "indeed , the adjoint equation is inf  sup stable , similarly to the case of elliptic problems on non - divergence form discussed in @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper can be outlined as follows .",
    "first , in section [ sec : stokes ] , we introduce the stokes problem that we are interested in and propose the continuous minimization problem",
    ". then , in section [ fem ] , we present the non - conforming finite element method and prove some preliminary results . in section [ theory ]",
    "we prove the fundamental stability and convergence results of the formulation .",

    "herein the main focus will be on methods that allow for the accurate approximation of the solution under the much weaker stability estimates that remain valid in the case of ill - posed problems where fails .",

    "this lack of boundary information makes the problem ill - posed and we assume that some other data is known such as :    * the normal stress in some part of the boundary @xmath19 and @xmath20 , @xmath21 we will refer to this problem as the _ cauchy problem _ below . * the measured value of @xmath22 in some subdomain @xmath23 .",
