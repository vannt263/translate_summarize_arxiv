    "ultra high mobilities and observation of ballistic transport make graphene based devices a potential alternative for silicon based devices @xcite .",
    "the zero energy gap between the valence and conduction band in the energy spectrum of single layer graphene ( slg ) makes it difficult to achieve a high on - off ratio in field effect transistor ( fet ) . on the other hand ,",
    "bilayer graphene ( blg ) devices hold greater promise in terms of better device performance with larger on - off ratio .",
    "this is feasible because of the band gap opening due to the breaking of inversion symmetry of the two layers in an otherwise gapless energy band structure .",
    "moreover , this gap between the conduction and valence band can be tuned by means of external gate electric field , as demonstrated both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite . in particular , zhang et al .",
    "@xcite have reported a direct observation of the band gap in the bilayer by infrared absorption .",
    "they have used dual gate bilayer fet where 80 nm al@xmath1o@xmath2 film was used as the top gate and 285 nm sio@xmath1 as the back gate .",
    "misewich et al.@xcite have shown that it is possible to get polarized infrared optical emission from a carbon nanotube fet by creating an effective forward biased p - n junction along the nanotube channel .",
    "this was achieved by applying the gate - drain voltage v@xmath3 , comparable to the drain - source voltage v@xmath4 , and maximum emission was obtained when v@xmath5 .",
    "electrical measurements showed that the optical emissions results from the radiative recombination of electrons and holes near the junction .",
    "similar experiments carried out by meric et .",
    "@xcite on single layer graphene ( slg ) device have reported formation of p - n junction along the graphene channel . however , owing to the absence of the band gap in slg , the recombination of electrons and holes at / near the junction does not yield any radiation . in comparison ,",
    "bilayer graphene ( blg ) device can serve as a prospective candidate is this regard since a band gap can be opened and controlled simultaneously by application of external electric field perpendicular to the layers . thus , by creating a p - n junction along the bilayer channel by proper biasing of the device , we may be able to fabricate novel source of terahertz radiation @xcite based on the recombination of carriers .    in this paper",
    "we show that the blg device can change from unipolar state to ambipolar state by varying the drain - source bias along the bilayer channel at different top gate voltages ( v@xmath6 ) .",
    "this has been possible because of very high gate capacitance of the top gate .",
    "we also report a quantitative analysis of the band gap opening in the bilayer graphene energy spectrum . in order to control the gap and the position of the fermi level independently , we have used the top and back gate device geometry .",
    "solid polymer electrolyte and 300 nm thick sio@xmath1 were used as top gate and back gate materials , respectively .",
    "this top gate arrangement allows us to shift the ferrmi energy significantly by applying a very small top gate voltage ( @xmath7 1 v ) because of its higher gate capacitance due to nanometer thick debye layer@xcite .",
    "in addition , our top gate geometry is a very simple way as compared to depositing high @xmath8 dielectric electric materials like hfo@xmath1 and al@xmath1o@xmath2 , using atomic layer deposition technique .",
    "we determine the top gate capacitance accurately by an application of top and back gates on a bilayer graphene device .",
    "it is shown that our device has very high gate capacitance @xmath9 , which is nearly 125 times larger compared to the gate capacitance of 300 nm sio@xmath1 ( 12 @xmath10 ) .",

    "the electrical contacts on the bilayer device were made by e - beam lithography , followed by thermal evaporation of 30 nm of gold and subsequent liftoff in acetone .",
    "the source drain separation ( l ) is @xmath7500 nm and the width ( w ) is @xmath75@xmath12 m . all the measurements were done at room temperature using two probe contacts .",
    "the drain - source and both the top and back gate biases were given from keithley 2400 source meters .",
    "the top gate material solid polymer electrolyte consists of liclo@xmath13 and polyethylene oxide ( peo ) in the ratio 0.12:1 @xcite .",

    "raman spectroscopy using 514.5 nm excitation laser was used to identify the bilayer graphene ( blg ) @xcite .",
    "raman spectrum of the bilayer graphene with the 2d mode resolved into four peaks is shown in figure [ fig1a](b ) .",
    "figure [ fig1a](c ) shows the ambipolar nature of i@xmath4 as a function of v@xmath6 for v@xmath4 = 10 mv and the back gate voltage v@xmath15 = 0 v. the dirac point is at v@xmath16 = -0.5 v , implying that our starting sample was electron doped .",

    ", we estimate the value of the top gate capacitance c@xmath6 as follows .",

    "v@xmath24=v@xmath14 , @xmath28 ; similarly for back gate c@xmath24=c@xmath15 , v@xmath24=v@xmath15 , @xmath29 . the gate - induced carrier density in a bilayer graphene is given by @xcite @xmath30 , \\hspace{3 mm } e_f < \\gamma_1\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the inter - layer hopping energy ( @xmath7 390 mev ) , @xmath32 and @xmath33 is the fermi velocity = 10@xmath34 @xcite .",
    "therefore , for a given v@xmath6 , the induced carrier density in the bilayer sample is @xmath35 where @xmath36 similar expressions hold good for the back gate geometry and when resistance is maximum ( r@xmath37 ) at a back gate voltage @xmath38 , @xmath39 to make the fermi energy shift zero .",
    "therefore , for a given v@xmath6 @xmath40 where c@xmath6 is the only unknown parameter . using the known c@xmath41 and @xmath42 for different v@xmath6 , the average value of c@xmath6 is found to be @xmath43 .",
    "note that , in this estimation the quantum capacitance is not assumed to be a constant as was done by meric et .",
    "knowing c@xmath6 , @xmath21 is thus determined as a function of v@xmath14 from equation ( [ ntopgate ] ) and ( [ a ] ) .",
    "the experimental curve of figure [ fig1a]c is then fitted to equation ( [ fit ] ) giving , @xmath12 = 730 @xmath44/v.sec , @xmath17 = 1.5 @xmath45 and r@xmath18 = 150 @xmath46 .",
    "we now discuss the characteristics of drain - source current ( i@xmath4 ) as a function of drain - source bias ( v@xmath4 ) .",
    "figure [ fig3](a ) and b shows i@xmath4 vs v@xmath4 for different top gate voltages .",
    "the main noticeable feature is a clear non - linear dependence of i@xmath4 on v@xmath4 , and a significant effect of the gate voltage on the shape of the i@xmath4 - v@xmath4 curves .",
    "to understand the non - linear i@xmath4 - v@xmath4 curve , we look at the schematic in figure [ fig4](a ) . for v@xmath4 @xmath47 v@xmath6 ,",
    "the bilayer channel will be electron doped for ( v@xmath6 - v@xmath16)@xmath48 0 and hole doped for ( v@xmath6 - v@xmath16)@xmath49 0 and the doping ( @xmath50 ) will be homogeneous along the channel length . however , this is not the case when v@xmath4 is comparable to v@xmath6 . in this case",
    "the voltage difference between the gate and the bilayer channel varies from ( v@xmath6 - v@xmath16 ) at the source to v@xmath4 - ( v@xmath6 - v@xmath16 ) at the drain electrode .",
    "therefore , by varying drain - source voltage ( v@xmath4 ) at fixed v@xmath6 , the doping concentration @xmath50 changes from n type to p type along the channel length . in figure",
    "[ fig4](a ) , we have shown the carrier distribution @xmath50 , along the bilayer channel for three different cases of drain - source voltage ( v@xmath4 ) at ( v@xmath6 - v@xmath16 ) = 0.5 v.    case 1 : v@xmath4 @xmath49 ( v@xmath6 - v@xmath16 ) , and therefore the carriers @xmath50 will be electrons in the bilayer channel with @xmath51 @xmath48 @xmath52 = l ) . in this region ,",
    "i@xmath4 increases sub linearly with v@xmath4 because the average carrier concentration [ @xmath53 = @xmath54 decreases with v@xmath4 .",
    "case 2 : v@xmath4 = ( v@xmath6 - v@xmath16 ) , @xmath50 will be zero at @xmath55 = l and therefore , the conduction channel gets pinched off near the drain end making the region devoid of charge carriers . at this point",
    "the slope of the i@xmath4 vs v@xmath4 curve undergo a change ( figure [ fig4](b ) ) .",
    "case 3 : v@xmath4 @xmath48 ( v@xmath6 - v@xmath16 ) , the point in the channel where the pinch off occurs , moves deeper into the channel drifting towards the source electrode . as v@xmath4 @xmath48 ( v@xmath6 - v@xmath16 ) , the gate is negatively biased with respect to drain near the drain region . as",
    "a result carrier concentration @xmath50 will be holes near the drain region , as shown in the lower most panel of figure [ fig4](a ) . when v@xmath4 is increased beyond pinch off , the current increases due to enhanced p channel conduction .",
    "thus the bilayer channel is now viewed as comprising of distinct electron and hole regions , with the electron doped region shrinking as the applied drain - source bias is increased .",
    "the potential drop across the electron channel remains fixed at v@xmath6 - v@xmath16 while the drop across the hole region ( from drain end to pinch off ) increases as v@xmath4 - ( v@xmath6 - v@xmath16 ) , with the applied drain - source bias . as the device is operated beyond the pinch off , the dominant current carrier changes from electron to holes and the current increases as a function of v@xmath4 .",
    "it appears as if a forwrad biased p - n junction is formed at the pinch off region , with p - region towards the drain end and n - region to wards the source region .",
    "a noticeable feature is the absence of current saturation in all the i@xmath4 vs v@xmath4 curves as compared to the monolayer case reported recently @xcite . in order to address",
    "if the small length of the channel in our experiment ( @xmath7500 nm ) is responsible for non - saturation of current @xcite , we carried out experiments on a device of drain - source separation @xmath7 2.5@xmath12 m and width @xmath7 1.5 @xmath12 m .",
    "this also did not show any signature of current saturation .    in order to analyze the i@xmath4 - v@xmath4 curves , we model the drain ccurrent as    @xmath56    where @xmath57@xmath58(@xmath55 ) is drift velocity . the drift velocity can be written as @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the longitudinal electric field due to drain - source bias , v(@xmath55 ) is",
    "the potential drop at point @xmath55 in the channel and @xmath12 is the mobility .",
    "therefore , @xmath61 where the upper and lower limits signifies the voltage drop at the drain and source ends , respectively .",
    "the drop due to the contact resistance at both the ends has been assumed to be equal . using the extracted values of the mobility ( @xmath12 ) , the contact resistance ( r@xmath62 ) , @xmath63n and @xmath21 , equation ( [ final ids ] ) is solved numerically .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] shows experimental data ( open circles ) for three top gate voltages along with the theoretical curves ( solid lines ) .",
    "it can be noted that agreement between the experiment and the calculation is quite good .      coming back to figure [ fig1 ]",
    ", it shows resistance as a function of the back gate voltage for a fixed top gate voltage . for v@xmath14 = 0 v",
    ", the maximum value of resistance ( r@xmath37 ) at a negative back gate voltage ( v@xmath64v@xmath65 @xmath66 ) clearly establishes that the bilayer graphene channel is intrinsically n - doped .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows that the value of r@xmath37 is minimum at @xmath67 = -0.4 v and increases almost symmetrically on changing v@xmath14 .",
    "it can also be seen , that for a particular top gate voltage , the drain - source current is not symmetric for electron and hole doping .",
    "the change in the maximum value of resistance ( r@xmath37 ) at different top gate voltages arises due to the opening of an energy gap between the conduction and valence bands of the bilayer graphene @xcite .",
    "it has been shown both theoretically@xcite and experimentally @xcite that a difference between the on - site energy in the layers leads to an opening of the gap between conduction and valence band which touch each other at the zone edge k point of brillouin zone @xcite .",
    "this on - site energy difference can be controlled externally by the application of electric field , perpendicular to the layers , which implies a potential energy difference @xmath68v and hence a gap @xmath69 .",
    "experimentally such fields in - between two carbon layers were created either by application of top and bottom gates simultaneously @xcite or by chemical doping of a back gated device @xcite . in the presence of an electric filed in between the layers , the hamiltonian for the bilayer graphene near the k point",
    "can be written as    @xmath70    with , @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath31 are the inplane and interlayer nearest neighbor hopping energies respectively .",
    "the eigen - values of the above hamiltonian for the lower subbands of the bilayer graphene can be written as : @xmath73 where @xmath74 correspond to conduction and valence bands , respectively .",
    "figure [ figgap](a ) shows the band structure of bilayer graphene having a band gap ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "the relation between the band gap and potential energy difference ( @xmath68v ) is given by @xcite    @xmath75    which shows that there will be no band gap if @xmath68v = 0 .",
    "figure [ figgap](b ) shows the induced carrier density in each carbon layer along with the electric field in between them in the presence of top and back gates .",
    "the total induced carrier density in bilayer , due to @xmath67 is : @xmath76 and similarly , for @xmath77 , @xmath78 .",
    "therefore , total induced carrier density in bilayer graphene due to top and back gates is : @xmath79\\ ] ] where , for simplicity , we have neglected the quantum capacitance . considering the screened electric field ,",
    "the induced carrier density due to top gate is @xmath80 and @xmath81 where subscripts 1 and 2 refer to top and bottom layers , respectively , as shown in figure [ figgap](b ) . for a screening length of @xmath82 ,",
    "we can write for top gate n@xmath83 where @xmath84 is the separation between the two layers ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "thus , for the top gate @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "similar expression holds good for the back gate .",
    "thus , in presence of back and top gates the resultant electric field inside the bilayer would be @xmath88 , where    @xmath89    where @xmath90 @xmath7 2.5 is the dielectric constant of the bilayer graphene @xcite .",
    "the same analysis holds good for @xmath91 as well .",
    "therefore , the net electric field between two carbon layers is ,    @xmath92\\ ] ]    it should be noted that for @xmath93 the equation ( [ field_screening ] ) reduces to    @xmath94\\ ] ]    i.e. the field without screening which corresponds to two layers having equal carrier density .",
    "it can be seen from equation ( [ inducedcharge_woscreening ] ) and ( [ field_screening ] ) that minimal value of the resistance maximum should appear when v@xmath23 = 0 v and v@xmath6 = 0 v , since this would imply that fermi energy e@xmath95 = 0 ( since @xmath96 = 0 ) and band gap @xmath68 g = 0 ( since e = 0 ) .",
    "as mentioned earlier , in our experiment minimum value of r@xmath37 appears at v@xmath6 = -0.4 v ( figure [ fig1 ] ) because of unintentional electron doping . to consider the effect of electric field inside the bilayer due to this unintentional electron doping , we place a positive charge sheet of carrier density @xmath97 above the top carbon layer , given by @xmath98 obtained from the back gate sweep for v@xmath6 = 0 v , as shown in figure [ fig1 ] ( v@xmath65@xmath7 -40v ) .",
    "thus the net electric field inside the bilayer is written as    @xmath99\\ ] ]    where @xmath100 is the field due to @xmath97 .",
    "the potential energy difference between the two layers is @xmath101 , and the value of the gap is estimated from equation ( [ gap ] ) .",
    "taking back gate capacitance c@xmath41 and top gate capacitance c@xmath102 , figure [ figgap]c shows the plot of the value of the band gap , with screening @xmath103 @xcite and without screening @xmath93 , as a function of v@xmath6 ( where band gap values are evaluated at r@xmath37 for each of the back gate characteristic at fixed v@xmath6 ( figure [ fig1 ] ) ) .",
    "it can be seen from figure [ figgap]c , that @xmath69 is minimum at v@xmath6 = - 0.4 v. this trend follows from the trend of r@xmath37 ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "we notice that , had the arrangement of @xmath97 been placed below the bottom layer , then the field components associated with it would have changed their direction and the calculated energy gap would not have followed the trend of r@xmath37 .",
    "thus , our assumption that the arrangement of unintentional carrier density @xmath97 lies above the top layer has indeed been justified",
    "in conclusion , the bilayer channel transforms from n type to p type conduction channel as we vary the drain - source voltage .",
    "this variation results in nonlinear dependence of i@xmath4 on v@xmath4 as a function of v@xmath14 which has been quantitatively explained .",
    "contrary to the recently reported monolayer case , we did not observe any signature of current saturation for i@xmath4 . in the presence of a gap in bilayer energy spectrum ,",
    "the formation of p - n junction creates new possibility for the bilayer device as a source of terahertz radiation @xcite , similar to infrared emission from the carbon nanotubes @xcite .",
    "the radiation from recombination between electrons and holes at the junction may acts as terahertz source depending on the magnitude of the gap that can be opened .",
    "the opening of a gap in the bilayer spectrum was studied , where the gap was controlled using a top and back gate geometry .",
    "however the band gap opening is limited by the restriction on the back gate voltage , since the breakdown field for the sio@xmath1 is 1v / nm ( up to 300v in our case ) .",
    "the capacitance of the polymer electrolyte was determined accurately .",
    "thus solid polymer electrolyte gating of graphene devices may open up new avenues for graphene based electronics , particularly where higher carrier concentration is required .",
