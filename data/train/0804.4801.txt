    "the observational confirmation about the accelerated expansion of the universe [ 1 , 2 ] has given rise to a lot of dark energy models [ 3 - 6 ] , which are supposed to be the reason behind this present acceleration .",
    "this mysterious fluid called dark energy is believed to dominate over the matter content of the universe by 70 @xmath0 and to have enough negative pressure as to drive present day acceleration .",
    "most of the dark energy models involve one or more scalar fields with various actions and with or without a scalar field potential [ 7 ] .",
    "recently tachyonic field with lagrangian @xmath1 [ 8 ] has gained a lot of importance in this respect .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor of the tachyon field can be seen as a combination of two fluids , dust with pressure zero and a cosmological constant with @xmath2 , thus generating enough negative pressure such as to drive acceleration .",
    "also the tachyon field has a potential which has an unstable maximum at the origin and decays to almost zero as the field goes to infinity . depending on various forms of this potential following this asymptotic behaviour a lot of works",
    "have been carried out on tachyonic dark energy [ 9 , 10 ] , tachyonic dark matter [ 11 , 12 ] and inflation models [ 13 ] .",
    "+ to obtain a suitable evolution of the universe an interaction is often assumed such that the decay rate should be proportional to the present value of the hubble parameter for good fit to the expansion history of the universe as determined by the supernovae and cmb data [ 14 ] .",
    "these kind of models describe an energy flow between the components so that no components are conserved separately .",
    "an interacting tachyonic - dark matter model has been studied in ref . [",
    "+ in this paper , we consider a model which comprises of a two component mixture .",
    "firstly we consider a mixture of barotropic fluid with tachyonic field without any interaction between them , so that both of them retain their properties separately .",
    "then we consider an energy flow between them by introducing an interaction term which is proportional to the product of the hubble parameter and the density of the barotropic fluid .",
    "we show that the energy flow being considerably high at the beginning falls down noticeably with the evolution of the universe indicating a more stable situation .",
    "also in both the cases we find the exact solutions for the tachyonic field and the tachyonic potential and show that the tachyonic potential follows the asymptotic behaviour discussed above . here",
    "the tachyonic field behaves as the dark energy component whereas the dust acts as the cold dark matter .",
    "next we consider tachyonic dark matter , the generalized chaplygin gas ( gcg ) being the dark energy component .",
    "gcg , identified by the equation of state ( eos ) @xmath3 with @xmath4 has been considered as a suitable dark energy model by several authors [ 16 , 17 ] .",
    "here we consider the mixture of gcg with tachyonic dark matter .",
    "later we have also considered an interaction between these two fluids by introducing a coupling term which is proportional to the product of hubble constant and the energy density of the gcg .",
    "the coupling function decays with time indicating a strong energy flow at the initial period and weak interaction at later stage implying a stable situation . like the previous case we have found the exact solution of the tachyonic potential . to keep the observational support of recent acceleration we have considered a particular form of evolution of the universe here as @xmath5 such that the deceleration parameter reads @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the scale factor .",
    "hence for @xmath8 we always get an accelerated expansion and for @xmath9 we get a constant expansion of the universe . this kind of recipe has been studied in ref . [ 12 ] .",

    "iv we have considered models represented by mixture of tachyonic field with barotropic fluid and gcg respectively .",

    "we have taken some particular values of the parameters and constants for the graphical representation of the tachyonic potential .",
