    "despite the well - known drawbacks , minimum energies are the foundation for estimates of the energetics of agn jets and the double - lobed radio sources ( dragns ) they create .",
    "the lobes , lying @xmath1 kpc from the centre of large elliptical galaxies , must be surrounded by gas at @xmath2@xmath3 k ( for simplicity , the `` intra - cluster medium '' ) .",
    "the icm confines the lobes either directly by thermal pressure or , as in conventional models for friis , by ram pressure .",
    "hence the ambient pressure @xmath4 gives a lower limit for the lobe energy density , to be compared with the minimum energy estimate .",
    "in several twin - jet fris , @xmath5 , but these jets are believed to be strongly entraining , so pressure support could be dominated by a thermal component not included in @xmath6 . in contrast , the lobes of friis and the similar `` relaxed doubles '' have sharp boundaries , suggesting little entrainment , as expected for cavities produced by powerful , relativistic jets .",
    "this is confirmed by the observed holes in the icm of cygnus  a @xcite .",
    "only a handful of powerful sources have environments detectable with pre-_xmm _ x - ray observatories .",
    "we have observed two of them with _ rosat _ , and discuss the results for these and others in the literature .",

    "[ overlays ] ) show compact central peaks , probably due to the agn .",
    "we therefore fitted the x - ray radial profiles with a _",
    "point - spread function plus a modified king ( @xmath0 ) model , giving a reasonable fit in both cases , with good agreement between hri and pspc for her a.

    "clearly the two are related , but in most objects @xmath19 .",
    "the two objects with the highest pressures and smallest discrepancy are the prototype classical doubles cyg a and 3c295 , which are expected to be strongly _ over - pressured _ , which means that * @xmath6 is in general least an order of magnitude below the true lobe pressure*. our sample is clearly biased to high external pressures ; but there is no reason why the ratio of true to minimum pressure should depend on the actual value of the pressure , so the bias should not affect our conclusion .",
    "the hotspot @xmath6 , not plotted here , is substantially above @xmath18 for cyg a and 3c295 but in 3c388 is still less than @xmath18 . however in frii models the whole lobe and not just the hotspot is expected to be over - pressured .",
    "inverse - compton radiation ( icr ) has now been detected from several radio lobes @xcite .",
    "the implied magnetic fields , @xmath20 , are generally within 60% of conventional minimum - energy values ; there are no cases where detectable icr is predicted for @xmath21 but not seen . *",
    "this suggests @xmath22 in typical radio lobes*. in contrast , our results would require @xmath23 to retain equipartition , while numerical simulations suggest that @xmath20 is below equipartition .",
    "these results could all be reconciled if the energy is dominated by `` invisible '' particles such as protons or low - energy electrons . for 3c388 , with its rather flat low - frequency spectra , it is not even enough to extend the energy spectrum to lorentz factor @xmath24 ; however @xmath25-@xmath26 jets may be saved if the observed power - law is only a `` tail '' on a relativistic - maxwellian energy distribution ( the lobe temperature must be relativistic if fed by relativistic jets ) .",
    "used minimum - energy estimates and spectral ages to derive a relation between jet power , @xmath27 , and narrow - line luminosity in 3cr radio galaxies : @xmath28}}$ ] .",
    "similarly , relate accretion disc luminosity ( effectively the big blue bump ) to [ oiii ] `` magnitude '' for pg quasars , which can be decoded as : @xmath29}}$ ] .",
    "the falcke et al . relation appears to hold irrespective of radio - loudness .",
    "show that [ oiii ] is somewhat anisotropic , with quasars 510 times more luminous in [ oiii ] than corresponding radio galaxies ; however , as the rawlings & saunders correlation is partly based on the more isotropic [ oii ] , we estimate a factor of 3 offset between the effective [ oiii ] luminosities in the above two relations . to be conservative ,",
    "we assume that the agn bolometric luminosity @xmath30 is twice that of the big blue bump , to allow for the ir and x - ray peaks .",
    "thus for radio loud objects , the rawlings & saunders result implies @xmath31 . a primary uncertainty in the spectral age , the use of @xmath32 , is strongly supported by the icr results .",
    "a systematic underestimate of ages of up to about 3 is possible from mixing within the lobes @xcite . even allowing for that , *",
    "our calibration of @xmath33 implies that the jet kinetic luminosity in radio - loud agn is at least as large as the bolometric luminosity of the agn , and may substantially exceed it*. there is no reason why this should not be so , as jets and thermal radiation are independent by - products of accretion ; jets are not powered by the agn radiation .    if jets are a primary energy loss mechanism of agn in cluster - centre ellipticals ( which are always radio - loud if active at all ) , then much of the accretion energy produced by the growth of the central black hole does work on the cluster gas , heating it .",
    "taking @xmath34 , we assume half of this goes into the jet , and ( consistent with rawlings and saunders ) that half of the jet power does work on the cluster as opposed to being ultimately radiated as very - low - frequency radio waves , the total energy supplied to the cluster gas is @xmath35 .",
    "if central black holes really follow the relation , this corresponds to @xmath36 times the galaxy rest mass , more than ten times the available energy from supernova - driven winds .",
    "thus jets must have had a dramatic effect on the cluster gas at early epochs , where most agn activity and , presumably , black hole growth occurred ."
