    "through a statistical measurement of information related to inhomogeneities in the universe , the galaxy power spectrum provides a strong tool in the present era of precision cosmology .",
    "in addition to information related to the primordial power spectrum , characterized by a slope and a normalization , through a turnover at @xmath0 , the overall shape of the galaxy power spectrum captures cosmological information related to the horizon at the matter - radiation equality .",
    "in addition to the overall shape , additional features in the galaxy power spectrum allow improved measurements of several cosmological parameters . similar to the oscillatory features in the cmb anisotropy power spectrum",
    ", the matter power spectrum is expected to exhibit the presence of baryons through oscillations .",
    "these features are associated with the sound horizon at the end of the compton - drag epoch and capture information related to @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "unlike well - known oscillatory features in the angular power spectrum of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies , baryon related oscillations in the matter power spectrum of the large - scale structure are highly suppressed due to the low baryon - to - dark matter ratio . for currently favored @xmath3cdm cosmologies ,",
    "baryon oscillations in the matter power spectrum have amplitude variations at the level of @xmath4 8% with effective widths in fourier space of order @xmath5 h mpc@xmath6 . while the ideal way to detect baryon oscillations is to measure the three - dimensional dark matter power spectrum directly , unfortunately , there are no useful probes of this quantity .",
    "the effects such as the weak gravitational lensing , which trace matter fluctuations , only provide information related to the projected power spectrum over a broad window function in the redshift space ( e.g. , bartlemann & schneider 2001 ) .",
    "this leads to an averaging of small features such as baryon oscillations such that they remain undetectable even considering most favorable scenarios .",
    "galaxy redshift surveys , on the other hand , allow a measurement of the three dimensional power spectrum of the galaxy distribution . since galaxies are expected to trace matter fluctuations , at least in large and linear scales , the galaxy power spectrum has been pursued for an observational detection of baryon oscillations .",
    "when detected , baryon oscillations are expected to allow significant improvements in parameter determination by breaking various degeneracies associated with the interpretation of cmb data @xcite .",
    "while expectations for precision parameter measurements are generally high , these have been tested to some extent with measured power spectra from redshift surveys such as the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ; colless et al .",
    "2001 ) when combined with recent results from cmb anisotropy experiments ( e.g. , percival et al .",
    "the same surveys have allowed first attempts to detect baryon oscillations , though , there is still no significant evidence for them ( e.g. , percival et al .",
    "2001 ; also , see , miller nichol & batuski 2001 ) .",
    "this can be understood by the fact that three - dimensional redshift surveys , so far , lack the required volume , with sizes of order @xmath7 h@xmath6 mpc in each dimension , to reliably resolve them .",
    "in addition to galaxy redshift surveys , a number of additional observational efforts are either under way or planned to image the large - scale structure out to a redshift of a few .",
    "these wide - field surveys typically cover tens to thousands of square degrees on the sky and include weak gravitational lensing shear observations with instruments such as the supernova acceleration probe ( snap ; massey et al .",
    "2003 ) and the large aperture synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ; tyson , wittmann & angel 2000 ) , and observations of the sunyaev - zeldovich effect @xcite with dedicated small angular scale cmb telescopes such as the south pole telescope ( spt ; stark et al .",
    "these surveys are expected to produce catalogs of dark matter halos , which in the case of lensing and sz surveys are expected to be essentially mass selected @xcite .",
    "while the halo number count as a function of redshift is a well - known cosmological test @xcite , one can also consider the additional information supplied by the clustering of halos . in particular , similar to the approach in galaxy redshift surveys , one can measure the power spectrum of clustering associated with these halos , as a whole , and use that power spectrum for cosmological studies .",
    "in addition to the shape , cosmological information comes from the redshift evolution of _ rulers _ that can be calibrated through cmb data @xcite .",
    "the cosmological studies based on the galaxy power spectrum and related halo clustering information , unfortunately , is affected by non - linearities .",
    "while sources are expected to trace inhomogeneities in mass , due to the non - linear evolution of gravitational perturbations at late times , the galaxy power spectrum at small scales departs significantly from the linear description corrected for source bias .",
    "the enhancement of power due to non - linearities erases oscillatory features @xcite , while effects such as redshift - space distortions further contribute to their disappearance . due to the cosmological significance of baryon oscillations",
    ", suggestions have already been made to detect them at redshifts of a few since the non - linear scale at high redshift is expected to move to smaller scales than today @xcite .    in the case of current measurements , the cosmological interpretation is restricted only for large scales where clustering is expected to be linear . the standard approach to describe",
    "the galaxy power spectrum involves the linear power spectrum scaled by a constant bias factor ( e.g. , percival et al .",
    "while slight modifications to the bias description have been considered @xcite , there is still no guidance as to how non - linearities affect cosmological parameter measurements and what approaches can be made to improve such estimates .",
    "additionally , by restricting cosmological interpretation to specific range of wave numbers , it is likely that we have only extracted limited information from current data .",
    "for example , in the case of the 2dfgrs , analyzes have only been considered out to a wave number of 0.15 h mpc@xmath6 , while measurements span to considerably smaller scales .",
    "it is clear that further studies are needed on galaxy clustering well in to the non - linear regime and to understand what information can be extracted from the non - linear regime of clustering , or at least , from transition regime where non - linearities become important .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to understand the onset of non - linearities in the galaxy power spectrum . while detailed numerical simulations are useful for this purpose , here , we make use of the halo approach to galaxy clustering @xcite .",
    "the halo approach provides a useful tool to understand certain aspects of clustering and is physically consistent model without any prior assumptions on the biasing nature of galaxies with respect to the dark matter distribution ( for a review , see , cooray & sheth 2002 ) .",
    "we study how cosmological parameter measurements can be improved by extracting information from mildly non - linear scales that are currently ignored . in particular , we pay attention to systematics that are introduced to cosmological parameter measurements when the galaxy power spectrum is modeled simply with a scaled version of the linear power spectrum . we show that parameter estimates are biased away from the true values and that these departures can be significantly reduced when the non - linear contribution , at least near the regime of transition from linear to non - linear clustering , is modeled as a power-law.since parameters related to this description is determined from data simultaneously with cosmological parameter estimates , this approach leads to a slight degradation of errors associated with cosmological parameters alone .",
    "the main advantage is that these estimates , however , remain either unbiased or biased at a level that is negligible .",
    "the suggested approach can be easily implemented with current studies and when interpreting results related to completed 2dfgrs and sdss surveys @xcite , among others .",
    "the suggested approach also avoids an arbitrary distinction as to what scales correspond to the linear regime of clustering while also allowing the maximum extraction of cosmological information from data .",
    "the paper is organized as following . in the next section ,",
    "we outline main considerations related to the halo approach to galaxy clustering .",
    "we refer the reader to review by cooray & sheth ( 2003 ) for full details of this approach .",
    "we make use of the fisher matrix approach to quantify biases and expected errors on parameter measurements in section  3 . in section  4 ,",
    "we conclude with a summary .",
    "the halo approach provides a physically motivated scheme to understand non - linear clustering of dark matter and various tracer populations of the large scale structure ( see cooray & sheth 2002 for more details ) . under this description ,",
    "the galaxy spectrum takes the form of @xmath8 ^ 2 .",
    "\\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\label{eqn : gal}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath9 denotes the mean number density of galaxies and @xmath10 denotes the normalized fourier transform of the galaxy density distribution within a halo of mass @xmath11 .",
    "the standard assumption here is that galaxies trace dark matter within halos such that one can utilize the dark matter distribution given by analytic forms such as the nfw @xcite profile .",
    "an improved approximation will be to use the density distribution defined by sub - halos . since relevant profiles related to substructure",
    "is still not well studied numerically , we make use of the dark matter density profile to describe the galaxy distribution within halos . in equations  [ eqn : gal ] and [ eqn : barngal ] , @xmath12 is the halo mass function ( e.g. , press & schechter 1974 ) and @xmath13 is the halo bias relative to linear clustering @xcite .    an important ingredient in the halo description of galaxy clustering is the halo occupation number @xcite .",
    "following sheth & diaferio ( 2001 ) , for the illustration of non - linear effects related to galaxy clustering , we take a description motivated by semi - analytic models : @xmath14 where we set @xmath15 and take @xmath16 and @xmath17 as free parameters . in our fiducial description , these two parameters take numerical values of 0.8 and 0.7 , respectively .    in addition to the mean number of galaxies as a function of halo mass , for the one - halo term of the power spectrum ( equation  [ eqn : gal ] ) , we need information related to the second moment of the halo occupation number , @xmath18 . if the probability distribution function for galaxy occupation is poisson , then @xmath19 , though departures from the poisson description is clearly visible in numerical data @xcite .",
    "following scoccimarro et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , we make use of the binomial distribution , matched to numerical data , to obtain a convenient approximation . the second moment is then @xmath20 where @xmath21 for @xmath22 and @xmath23 thereafter . note that in equation  [ eqn : gal ] , the simplest approach is to set @xmath24 when calculating @xmath25 . in halos which contain only a single galaxy ,",
    "however , it is natural to assume that this galaxy sits at the center .",
    "thus , an improved model for the galaxy distribution is to take @xmath24 when @xmath26 is greater than unity and @xmath27 otherwise .    in fig .  1",
    ", we show the galaxy power spectrum calculated following the halo model and a comparison to the non - linear dark matter power spectrum , again calculated under the halo model ; to describe dark matter clustering , one removes information related to the halo occupation number and the number density of galaxies from equation  [ eqn : gal ] .",
    "note that in fig .  1 and throughout , we plot the logarithmic power spectrum , @xmath28 instead of @xmath29 itself .",
    "we also show a measurement of the real space power spectrum from the iras pscz survey @xcite as determined by hamilton & tegmark ( 2002 ) . in the bottom plot of fig .  1",
    ", we show the transition regime between linear and non - linear clustering . at large scales ,",
    "where the two - halo term dominates , the galaxy power spectrum traces the linear clustering with a constant bias",
    ". one can understand this by noting that at large scales , @xmath30 and the galaxy power spectrum simplifies to @xmath31 with @xmath32 denoting the mean bias factor of the galaxy population .",
    "this is consistent with the standard assumption in the literature that the galaxy bias , at large scales , is constant .",
    "the drawback with this description is that the physical scale below which this assumption breaks down is ill defined .",
    "it is generally assumed that the on set of non - linearity is at wave numbers @xmath4 0.1 h mpc@xmath6 , though this is only based on numerical simulations of the non - linear dark matter power spectrum .",
    "while such a scale is valid for the dark matter distribution , when considering galaxies , there is no reason why the same situation should hold . in the case of the halo approach to galaxy clustering , the onset of non - linearities , by which we assume the dominance of the 1-halo term , is model dependent . to illustrate this , in fig .  2 , we model the galaxy power spectrum as a function of @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "note that the transition is strongly sensitive to @xmath16 such that when @xmath16 is low , the galaxy power spectrum traces the linear clustering down to relatively smaller scales , @xmath4 0.5 mpc@xmath6 , while when @xmath16 is high ( @xmath33 0.8 ) , the onset of non - linearity is near 0.1 mpc@xmath6 .",
    "if @xmath34 simply scales as @xmath35 , then the galaxy power spectrum is independent of @xmath17 , as one renormalizes by the galaxy number density which is also an integral of this quantity weighted by the mass function . in fig .  2",
    ", we see slight dependences on @xmath17 since the halo occupation number was modeled with two parts , one which is a constant and another involving a power - law . in this case , the 1-halo term is slightly dependent on the numerical value of @xmath17 .",

    "this is opposite from the case associated with the real space power spectrum where the on set of non - linearity is always associated with an increase in power relative to the linear power spectrum scaled by a constant bias .",
    "another way to state this observations is that the bias factor for galaxies in redshift space , relative to linear clustering , decreases from a constant value at large scales when non - linearities become important .",
    "as one moves to much small scales ( @xmath88 mpc@xmath6 ) , the non - linear redshift space power spectrum dominates over the linear description and the bias factor increases back to a higher value ( see , fig .  3 ) .",
    "this is consistent with calculations of the redshift space bias by seljak ( 2001 ) .",
    "as shown in fig .  4 , we found the reduction in non - linear power to be present when certain parameters related to the halo model description is varied and we consider this to be a general feature of the redshift space power spectrum .    in general ,",
    "our calculations indicate that the linear assumption is only valid out to @xmath4 0.1 mpc@xmath6 both in the case of the real and redshift space power spectra and proper modeling of these data beyond such a scale must include some accounting of non - linearities .",
    "if measurements beyond 0.1 mpc@xmath6 is used for cosmological purposes , with a constant bias factor , one can potentially misidentify the drop in power due to non - linearities as due to a cosmological effect , for example , due to a massive neutrino since massive neutrinos are expected to damp power at small scales . in the next section , we address this issue in detail using the fisher matrix based approach to quantify how non - linearities affect cosmological parameter determination and what improvements can be introduced to avoid potential biases .",
    "to quantify the extent to which cosmological parameters can be affected by assumptions in the literature and to calculate expected errors on cosmological parameters and associated biases , we make use of the fisher information matrix : @xmath89 whose inverse provides the optimistic covariance matrix for errors on the associated parameters ( e.g. , tegmark et al .",

    ", we first focus on the binned real space galaxy power - spectrum and return to the case involving the redshift space power spectrum as part of the discussion .",
    "the binned power spectrum can be written as an integral average over a shell in k - space centered around some wave number @xmath95 with width @xmath96 : @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the shell volume and @xmath99 is the total survey volume .",
    "the full covariance related to measurement of this binned power spectrum is @xcite @xmath100 \\ , , \\label{covariance}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath101 is the non - gaussian contribution to the covariance of the power spectrum .",
    "this non - gaussian contribution depends on parallelogram configurations of the trispectrum , @xmath102 , and we make use of the 1-halo term of the halo approach @xcite to calculate it following cooray & hu ( 2001 ) .",
    "this approach is a valid description since in linear scales the covariance is dominated by the gaussian variance while non - gaussianities are only significant in non - linear scales where the 1-halo term dominates .",
    "we can write the relevant contribution as @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the fourth moment of the halo occupation distribution .",
    "we follow our previous description related to the galaxy power spectrum and write @xmath105[3\\beta^2(m)-2]\\left < n_{{\\rm gal}}\\right>^4 $ ] , where departures from the poisson model , denoted with the function @xmath106 in equation  [ binomial ] is related to the adopted binomial distribution following scoccimarro et al .",
    "( 2001 ) . in equation  [ covariance ] , we allow for the shot - noise contribution to the power spectrum variance by redefining @xmath107 such that the power spectrum is averaged over the shell with the shot noise contribution of @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is the number density of galaxies in the survey . in the gaussian limit , the covariance only results in a diagonal error matrix with no correlations between band powers .",

    "in addition to parameter errors , fisher matrix approach also allows a useful technique to quantify the biases associated with parameter estimates when the model description departs from the observations .",
    "for example , in the present case , the galaxy power spectrum is usually modeled with a combination of the linear power spectrum and a scale - free bias out to a certain wavenumber , beyond which no information is used for cosmological purposes .",
    "we can quantify the extent to which this is valid by studying parameter biases such that if @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the true value of the parameter @xmath16 and @xmath115 is the resulting bias due to the wrong description of the power spectrum ( in this case , linear power spectrum times constant bias ) , then @xmath116 \\left[{\\cal c}_{ij}\\right]^{-1}\\frac{\\partial \\hat{p}_j}{\\partial p_\\beta } \\",

    "the non - gaussian contribution to the covariance of the binned galaxy power spectrum is relatively minor and results in a relative increase , when compared to the gaussian covariance , by a factor of 1.4 , at @xmath125 0.25 mpc@xmath6 and a factor of 2 at @xmath125 0.5 mpc@xmath6 .",
    "note that if the number density of galaxies were to be higher , such that the shot - noise is reduced at small scales , then the relative importance of the non - gaussian contribution to full covariance increases .",
    "the power spectrum is assumed to be that modeled from the halo approach with @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "we renormalized the power spectrum such that the bias factor is unity at large scales .",
    "we then model the galaxy power spectrum through a combination of the linear power spectrum and the constant bias , again assuming to be unity .",
    "the parameter errors and associated biases are tabulated in table  1 for a @xmath3cdm cosmological model with a dark energy equation of state @xmath42 and allowing for massive neutrino contribution to the mass density of the universe .",
    "we tabulated errors and biases as a function of the maximum @xmath128 value , @xmath129 , to which galaxy power spectrum analysis is considered to be linear . at typical large scales , with @xmath130 mpc@xmath6 , the biases are negligible and we recover parameter errors usually quoted in the literature by the fisher matrix based analyzes similar to the one performed here @xcite . in table  1",
    ", we also tabulate errors expected from the galaxy power spectrum alone and the galaxy power spectrum combined with final wmap data ( middle rows ) and with planck data ( bottom rows ) .",
    "the cmb information also includes polarization data in addition to temperature .",
    "as one includes information out to smaller scales , or large @xmath129 values , from the galaxy power spectrum , certain parameters , such as @xmath2 and @xmath131 , become better determined than out to an early cutoff , say at @xmath130 mpc@xmath6 .",
    "this can be understood by the fact that the small scale regime of the galaxy power spectrum captures information related to these parameters through additional oscillatory features and the damping of power by massive neutrinos .",
    "this , however , comes at the expense of increasing biases in the parameter determination since in this regime , non - linearities enter the galaxy power spectrum as the 1-halo term becomes important and starts to dominate when @xmath132 mpc@xmath6 ( see , fig .",
    "thus , the simple description based on the linear power spectrum and the scale - free bias breaks down when @xmath133 mpc@xmath6 though there is significant amount of cosmological information beyond this cut off scale .",
    "note that in table  1 we do not consider @xmath129 values above 0.5 since for the survey parameters we have considered , the shot - noise term associated with the finite number density of galaxies starts to become important . for future surveys that attempt to measure an increased number of redshifts ,",
    "it is clear that one gains further cosmological information by moving to smaller scales .",
    "while cosmological parameter estimation from data below @xmath4 0.1 mpc@xmath6 is unaffected by non - linearities , it is useful to consider possibilities that can return information at wave numbers above this value .",
    "this is due to the fact that current surveys , both 2dfgrs and sdss as well as previous surveys such as iras pcsz , probed to much smaller scales then implied by this arbitrary cut off . in the case of the real - space galaxy power spectrum , as shown in fig .  1 ( bottom panel )",
    ", we consider the possibility that the onset of non - linearity can be modeled by a power - law contribution when wave numbers out to 1 mpc@xmath6 is considered . in fact , for a good approximation , the 1-halo term can be modeled as a power - law in the mildly non - linear regime with @xmath134 where @xmath135 is the outer wave number to this approximation may be valid .",
    "this description includes three new parameters involving the normalization of the non - linear part of the power spectrum , @xmath56 , the slope , @xmath57 , and the scale at which the power - law breaks , @xmath135 .",
    "note that the power - law behavior remain the same when one considers different models of the halo occupation number ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "the extent to which this approximation may be valid can be considered based on the halo model description of the non - linear galaxy power spectrum with the addition of a power - law contribution . while one can assume the halo model generated power spectrum as the expected non - linear power spectrum for galaxies , in parameter estimation , one can consider the model fitting procedure based on the approximation that the non - linear power spectrum is @xmath136 .",
    "the last two parameters account for the non - linearity and , more importantly , the power law aspect of the 1-halo term .",
    "since at large scales @xmath137 , one expects the normalization to be given by @xmath138 and the power - law @xmath139 ( in fig .  1 ,",
    "@xmath140 since we plot the logarithmic power spectrum , or @xmath141 ) .",
    "the departure from this expected power - law captures the profile shape .",
    "thus , if these two parameters can be extracted from the data as well , one not only obtains information related to cosmology , but some aspect related to how galaxies populate dark matter halos .",
    "the numerical value of @xmath56 , for example , can aid in constraining model independent measurements of the halo occupation number @xcite .",
    "the extent to which this approximation may be valid is summarized in fig .  5 , for the same case shown in fig .  2 .",
    "here , we plot the ratio of the model power spectrum to that of the non - linear case as calculated by the halo model .",
    "as already discussed , the description that @xmath142 breaks down rapidly such that at a wavenumber of 0.1 mpc@xmath6 one underestimates the true non - linear power by a few percent while at 0.3 mpc@xmath6 , this underestimate is at the level of 25% . instead of @xmath142 , when one includes the additional power - law such that @xmath136 , the difference is below a few percent out to a wavenumber of 0.3 mpc@xmath6 suggesting that the transition is well modeled with the single power - law approximation .",
    "at a wavenumber of 0.5 mpc@xmath6 , the power - law assumption leads to an overestimate of power at a level of 5% and this overestimate is at the level of 30% when @xmath143 mpc@xmath6 , deep in the non - linear regime . while the single power - law assumption clearly breaks down at these small scales , the improvement over the simple linear assumption is significant when @xmath144 mpc@xmath6 .    while we have only considered a specific case with certain parameters for the halo occupation number in fig .  5",
    ", we expect the situation to be the same with different descriptions .",
    "the extent to which one departs , however , is model dependent as we have shown in fig .  2 , especially with respect to the slope of the halo occupation number - halo mass relation ( fig .  2 top panel ) .",
    "the differences move the non - linear scale from 0.05 to 0.2 mpc@xmath6 suggesting that the importance of the power - law varies over the same scales for different samples of galaxies .",
    "the extent to which the power - law approximation works will similarly vary and we note that depending on @xmath16 , this can be between 0.3 and 0.5 mpc@xmath6 while departures are at the level of 10% to 50% at 1 mpc@xmath6 ; if the power - law approximation is not included , the departures are substantial ( @xmath145% ) . regardless of the exact variations , such as on the extent to which the power - law assumption overestimate power when",
    "@xmath125 1 mpc@xmath6 , the power - law assumption provides a useful addition to the simple linear power spectrum description , with a constant bias , in mildly non - linear scales of order 0.2 to 0.4 mpc@xmath6 .",
    "note that the power - law assumption is independent of selection effects and biases related to observational aspects .",
    "this can be understood simply as following .",
    "the observed total power spectrum is simply a convolution of the real power spectrum time a window function that captures observational issues ( eq .",
    "since the true power spectrum can be described better with a combination of the linear power spectrum and a power - law correction , in the mildly non - linear scales , the observed power spectrum will remain essentially described by the same combination with the filtering aspects related to observations applied .",
    "thus , regardless of how observations are done or the galaxy power spectrum is measured , we expect our description to be accurate to the level we can also describe the true underlying power spectrum with the same assumptions .",
    "we can further understand the extent to which this model is valid by considering its ability to extract cosmological parameters . in table  2 , we list expected errors on cosmological parameters in addition to these two new astrophysically oriented parameters . while cosmological parameter estimates either remain same as in table  1 or worsen slightly , we note there is a sharp reduction in biases associated with parameter measurements when power spectrum information out to wave numbers of 0.5 mpc@xmath6 is included .",
    "this is significant since the assumed power - law behavior around the onset of non - linearity allows one to measure cosmology from previously ignored non - linear scales such that no biases are introduced . in fig .  6 , as an example , we show the measurement errors for two parameters ( @xmath1 and @xmath131 ) by marginalizing over all other parameters .",
    "we show expected errors in combination with wmap and planck and the improvement when information out to 0.5 mpc@xmath6 is included with two additional parameters to be determined from data . including information out to 0.5 mpc@xmath6",
    "improves parameter errors , for example in the case of neutrino mass , by roughly a factor of 2 .",
    "so far , we have only considered the real space galaxy power spectrum .",
    "a similar situation exists for the redshift space power spectrum , though , as discussed in section  2.2 , the onset of its non - linearity is associated with a decrease in power , relative to linear power spectrum times a constant bias , instead of an increase . to model this behavior , one can introduce an additional damping term associated with non - linear pairwise velocity to the usual formula involving the linear power spectrum @xcite .",
    "this leads to a modification to equation  [ eqn : deltaz ] @xmath146}{\\left[1+k^2\\mu^2 \\sigma^2/2\\right]^{1/2}}\\ , , \\ ] ] such that the angular averaged redshift space power spectrum takes the form of @xmath147}{6 \\left(k^2 \\sigma^2/2\\right)^2 } \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{\\left(\\beta - k^2 \\sigma^2/2\\right)^2 \\arctan(\\sqrt{k^2 \\sigma^2/2})}{\\left(k^2 \\sigma^2/2\\right)^{5/2}}\\big\\ } b_g^2 p^{{\\rm lin}}(k ) \\",

    "note that such a correction only accounts for the increase in power at large scale associated with bulk motions . at small scales , with wavenumbers",
    "@xmath4 0.1 mpc@xmath6 and larger , it is necessary to account for suppression of power related to virial motions with dispersion @xmath152 , and we suggest the use of equation  [ eqn : pzgal ] . in order to account for the 1-halo part of the non - linear redshift space power spectrum , especially for an analysis of data beyond a wavenumber of @xmath4 1 mpc@xmath6 , one can introduce again a power - law , following the suggested approach for the non - linear real space power spectrum . at mildly non - linear scales ,",
    "the approach suggested here leads to an additional parameter , @xmath152 , which can be simultaneously determined from data in additional to cosmological estimates .",
    "currently , the well studied redshift space power spectrum comes from the 2df survey and we plan to return to these issues as part of a combined modeling effort on non - linearities in this power spectrum based on cosmology as well as simplified corrections based on the halo approach .",
    "the galaxy power spectrum is now a well known tool of precision cosmology .",
    "ongoing surveys such as 2df and sdss have already provided a wealth of information related to cosmological parameters based on clustering of galaxies in the presumed linear regime , though measurements span down to much smaller scales than used for cosmological purposes .",
    "we have shown here that there is considerable amount on information in the regime where clustering transits from linear to non - linear .",
    "the extraction of this information , however , can not be done alone with the usual approach involving the linear power spectrum and a constant scale - free bias .",
    "we have investigated the non - linear behavior of the galaxy power spectrum in both real and redshift space based on the halo approach and have suggested that the on set of non - linearities can be modeled as a simple power - law .",
