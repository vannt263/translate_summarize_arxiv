    "the large thermal velocities of non - relativistic neutrinos suppress the growth of neutrino densities perturbations on scales smaller than their characteristic free - streaming comoving length @xmath35 since neutrinos induce a gravitational backreaction effect , also the evolution of both cold dark matter ( cdm ) and baryon @xcite density is affected and , therefore , the total matter power spectrum is hugely suppressed on such scales : this translates into a modification of the halo mass function ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
