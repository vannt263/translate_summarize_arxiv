    "the persistent current qubit using superconducting loop with three josephson junctions has been proposed as a promising candidate for quantum computer @xcite owing to the advantages of relatively long decoherence time and possible scalability .",

    "we calculate the switching probabilities of the coupled qubit system in cnot operation . for an appropriate range of parameters , target qubit oscillates and shifts to another state while the unwanted oscillation of control qubit can be suppressed , which can be implemented within the fault - tolerant criteria of quantum computing.@xcite moreover",
    "present coupling scheme offers the tunable coupling strength and the selective coupling from the scalable design , which is crucial for implementation of practical quantum computing but is not provided by the previous coupling schemes .",
