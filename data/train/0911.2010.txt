    "heavy fermion systems have attracted considerable interest ever since the initial studies @xcite in the 1970s .",
    "while the early interest was fueled by the unusual fermi liquid properties and superconductivity in these naturally magnetic materials , recent focus has been on their quantum critical behavior . in the following ,",
    "we will focus on antiferromagnetic heavy fermion metals , in which a zero - temperature phase transition between a paramagnet and an itinerant antiferromagnet occurs when an external tuning parameter , _",
    "e.g. _ external pressure , magnetic field , or compound composition , is varied  @xcite .",
    "this is made possible in part by the fact that the magnetic energy scales in these systems are small enough so that a moderate change of the tuning parameter corresponds to a sizeable perturbation . because they are metallic , these materials allow for systematically addressing the interplay between quantum critical fluctuations and unusual electronic excitations .",
    "the traditional approach to an itinerant antiferromagnetic quantum critical point ( qcp ) describes its universal properties in terms of a ginzburg - landau - wilson functional of the order parameter and its fluctuations  the @xmath0 theory  in @xmath1 dimensions",
    "@xcite , where @xmath2 is the spatial dimension ( typically @xmath3 or @xmath4 ) and @xmath5 corresponds to the dynamic exponent .",
    "because the effective dimensionality is at or above the upper critical dimension of the @xmath0 theory , one is led to expect gaussian behavior for such a hertz - millis or t=0 spin - density wave ( sdw ) qcp .",
    "the anticipated behavior of the spin relaxation rate @xmath6 at the ordering wave vector is ( for @xmath7 ) @xmath8 , which has indeed been observed in one heavy fermion system  @xcite .",
    "there are however a number of observations that can not be explained within the sdw approach  @xcite . in @xmath9 , at its critical concentration @xmath10 , the spin relaxation rate is linear in temperature , and the order - parameter susceptibility singularly depends on temperature and frequency with a fractional exponent  @xcite . in @xmath11 ,",
    "multiple energy scales collapse at its field - tuned qcp and , moreover , the fermi surface has been implicated to transition from large to small when the qcp is crossed from the paramagnetic side .",
    "these rich behaviors have led to the question as to whether and how the kondo screening is affected as the system undergoes a magnetic phase change  @xcite .",
    "an alternative to the traditional approach that is able to explain the aforementioned experiments is the local quantum critical scenario , in which a destruction of kondo screening of the f - moments coincides with the magnetic transition of the kondo lattice  @xcite .",
    "the name local quantum criticality refers to the localization of the electronic excitations associated with the f - moments .",
    "it also stresses the importance of long - range correlations along imaginary time , when the spatial correlations remain mean - field like as in the sdw scenario .",
    "both types of qcp have been described with the extended dynamical mean field theory ( edmft ) approach to the kondo lattice model , see fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "the quantum critical point in the heavy fermion compounds arises out of the competition between kondo screening and the rkky interaction  @xcite .",
    "a minimal model for these systems is the kondo lattice model @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the conduction @xmath2-electron spin density at the location of the local moment @xmath14 .",
    "the edmft approach captures not only the kondo screened fermi liquid phase and the itinerant magnetic phase but also the dynamical competition between the two underlying interactions .",
    "it maps the kondo lattice onto the bose - fermi kondo ( bfk ) model , @xmath15 augmented by a self - consistency constraint , see fig.[fig1 ] . here",
    "@xmath16 is a spin-@xmath17 local moment , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the kondo coupling and the coupling constant to the bosonic bath respectively , @xmath20 describes a fermionic bath with a constant density of states , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is the bosonic bath with the self - consistently determined spectral density .",
    "numerical evaluations of the edmft scheme for the easy - axis kondo lattice at finite temperature  @xcite and at zero temperature  @xcite indicate that the general phase diagram of the kondo lattice contains both the hertz - millis and the local quantum critical point . within edmft , the local quantum critical point of the lattice problem",
    "is related to the quantum critical point ( qcp ) of a dissipative bfk model  @xcite .",
    "if the self - consistency condition leads to a spectral density for the bosonic bath that behaves as @xmath23\\nonumber \\\\   & \\,\\sim&\\ ,    \\label{eq : sub - ohmic}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] below some dynamically generated scale @xmath24 with a bath exponent @xmath25 , the lattice qcp is mapped on the qcp of the sub - ohmic bfkm .",
    "when arguments related to the ones that lead to the ginzburg - landau - wilson functional of order - parameter fluctuations are applied , the sub - ohmic bfk model would be mapped to a one - dimensional classical spin chain with long - ranged interaction  @xcite and , by extension , a local-@xmath0 theory in @xmath26 dimension  @xcite .",
    "we will refer to this as the quantum - to - classical mapping of the qcp in the bfk model .",
    "in general , the quantum - to - classical mapping relates the quantum criticality to the classical criticality of order - parameter fluctuations in elevated dimensions  @xcite . for the local @xmath0 theory  @xcite",
    ", @xmath27 effectively acts as an upper critical dimension and a gaussian fixed point is expected for @xmath28 .",
    "correspondingly , there will be a violation of @xmath29 scaling due to the dangerously irrelevant quartic coupling of the @xmath0 theory . for @xmath30 ,",
    "the bosonic bath of the bfk model is ohmic and the corresponding classical spin chain is placed at its lower critical dimension .",
    "the transition at @xmath30 is thus kosterlitz - thouless like  @xcite .",
    "this raises the question as to how edmft manages to yield critical properties that differ from those of a local @xmath0-theory , especially the @xmath29-scaling of the order parameter susceptibility  @xcite .",
    "one possibility is that the self - consistency requirement leads effectively to a different quantum impurity problem for every temperature , i.e. @xmath31 is explicitly @xmath32-dependent in contrast to eq .",
    "( [ eq : sub - ohmic ] ) .",
    "another possibility is that already the quantum critical point of the bfk model can not be described by a local @xmath0-theory and that the quantum - to - classical mapping relating the two fails for the bfk model .",
    "this possibility has been recently discussed for the totally spin - isotropic bfk model as well as the easy - axis bfk model  @xcite .",
    "as already mentioned , the qcp arises out of the competition between the kondo effect and magnetic fluctuations .",
    "it therefore seems a prerequisite to choose an approach that correctly captures kondo screening , including the restoration of su(2 ) invariance at the kondo - screened fixed point . for this reason the easy - axis bfk model is delicate  @xcite . in the following",
    ", we will focus on the spin - isotropic bfk model where the restoration of the su(2 ) invariance in the kondo - screened phase is not an issue .",
    "the starting point for the quantum - to - classical mapping is the coherent state path integral representation of the quantum problem , which leads to the most classical formulation of the problem  @xcite . in the case of the bfk model , the effective functional integral",
    "is formulated in terms of spin coherent states to take into account the finite size of the hilbert space for the local moment  @xcite .    .",
    "the berry phase associated with a closed path is @xmath33 times the area traced out by @xmath34 ( @xmath33 is the size of the spin ) . for the path depicted in the figure",
    "the berry phase is @xmath33 times the shaded area .",

    "scaledwidth=50.0% ]    as a consequence , the order parameter manifold is the unit sphere in three dimensions and possesses rotational invariance .",
    "the usual canonical term of the bosonic coherent state path integral has to be replaced by a topological term , the berry phase , see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that the spin - isotropic bfk model can only be related to a local @xmath0-theory if the berry phase term of the spin coherent state path integral is neglected . in this case , @xmath38 on the other hand , due to the presence of a dangerously irrelevant quartic coupling of the @xmath0 theory , the local spin susceptibility at criticality for @xmath39 behaves as @xmath40 comparing eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dangirrel],[eq : dangirrelt ] ) shows the absence of the @xmath29-scaling .",
    "the spin - isotropic bfk model in the presence of the berry phase term has been studied in a dynamical large-@xmath41 limit  @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of the su(n)@xmath42 su(@xmath43 n ) bfk model is @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( with @xmath47 integer ) are the spin and channel indices respectively , and @xmath48 contains @xmath49 components .",
    "the local moment is expressed in terms of pseudo - fermions @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is related to the chosen irreducible representation of su(n )  @xcite . at the qcp",
    ", the order parameter susceptibility  @xcite behaves as @xmath52 for all @xmath25 .",
    "the @xmath29-scaling of @xmath35 for @xmath53 implies the breakdown of the quantum to classical mapping , since the mapped classical critical point has @xmath54 for @xmath55 . that this large-@xmath41 result is stable against dangerously irrelevant couplings that may occur at finite n has been demonstrated in  @xcite for the particular value @xmath56",
    "this issue is addressed by introducing a self - energy for the order parameter susceptibility , @xmath57 where @xmath58 follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq : sub - ohmic ] ) and @xmath59 is the value of the coupling constant @xmath60 at which the system becomes critical for a given @xmath61 .",
    "the @xmath62-independent part of @xmath63 , @xmath64 , vanishes at @xmath59 by definition .     with the same exponent as @xmath65 over a region that is cut off by the temperature of the system ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "( b ) the temperature dependent part of the saddle point self - energy displays power - law behavior over roughly five decades : @xmath67 , where @xmath68 and @xmath36 .",
    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]    this self - energy has a temperature dependent part , formally defined as @xmath69 with the important property @xmath70 it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that this temperature dependence implies that no dangerously irrelevant coupling can alter @xmath71 for @xmath39 .    we will now demonstrate that a similar spin self - energy can be obtained for the region with @xmath72 .",
    "numerical details can be found in ref .",
    "the dynamical spin susceptibility obeys the scaling form @xmath73 as demonstrated in fig.[fig2]b for the particular value @xmath36 and consistent with eq .",
    "( [ scal1 ] ) .",
    "the imaginary part of the inverse of the spin susceptibility is therefore @xmath62-dependent with a power - law consistent with that for @xmath74 from eq.([eq : sub - ohmic ] ) .",
    "this is shown in fig.[fig3]a for a particular temperature ( @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the half - bandwidth ) .",
    "the resulting spin self - energy at the critical coupling @xmath77 is shown in fig.[fig3]b .",
    "it behaves as @xmath78 .",
    "this demonstrates again that the critical properties of the spin - isotropic bfk model ( i.e. with the berry phase ) have the same characteristics for both @xmath79 and @xmath55 .",
    "finally , we note in passing that the critical point of the @xmath27 case does not appear to be special compared to that of the @xmath79 and @xmath55 cases . in particular",
    ", we do not observe the emergence at @xmath27 of any logarithmic corrections to the power laws in the dynamical local susceptibility and related quantities .",
    "in summary , the current interest in quantum critical heavy fermion systems has led to the question as to whether the kondo effect itself may become critical concomitant with the magnetic quantum transition .",
    "the effect of a critical kondo destruction can already be studied in a sub - ohmic bose - fermi kondo impurity model .",
    "we have reexamined the evidence that the berry phase term can not be neglected at the quantum critical point and that its presence changes the critical properties . without the berry phase term",
    "the quantum criticality is in the universality class of the classical local @xmath0-theory . with the berry phase term",
    "the quantum critical point is interacting in the whole parameter region @xmath25 and , therefore , not equivalent to that of a local @xmath0-theory .",
    "we demonstrated that the temperature dependence of the spin self - energy has the same characteristics between @xmath79 and @xmath55 . since the standard quantum - to - classical mapping links the critical properties of sub - ohmic impurity models to those of one - dimensional classical spin - chains with long - ranged interaction , one",
