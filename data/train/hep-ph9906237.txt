    "in this paper i want to revue a bethe salpeter formalism in qcd , which has been have developed recently in milano . such formalism ,",
    "if not completely derived from first principles , rests , however , only on some non controversial assumptions on the wilson loop correlator @xcite .",
    "it generalizes a method introduced previously for the case of the heavy quark potential @xcite and takes advantage of appropriate feynmann - schwinger like path integral representations for the qcd green functions .",
    "its three dimensional reduction has been recently applied to the light - light and heavy - light quark - antiquark spectrum with very encouraging results @xcite . beside the heavy quarkonia ,",
    "the lowest regge trajectories for the triplet @xmath1 states are very well reproduced in slope and intercepts and the known spin averaged light - heavy spectrum is obtained up to a mean deviation of about 10 mev .",
    "notice that it is very difficult to obtain a similar result in the frame of a single model .",
    "in fact in our case the strong coupling constant @xmath2 , the string tension @xmath3 and the heavy quark masses @xmath4 and @xmath5 were already completely determined by the potential fits ( apart the possibility of a very small rearrangement ) , while the light quark masses have been fixed a priori on typical current values ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "in particular the heavy - light sector is completely parameter free .",
    "the basic objects from which we start are the ordinary gauge invariant 4-point and 2-point green functions @xmath7 and @xmath8 , to which we refer as the `` first order '' functions . to these first order functions",
    "certain `` second order '' ones @xmath9 and @xmath10 can be related .",
    "it is for the second order functions that the mentioned path integral representations can be constructed .",
    "the important aspect of the above representations is that the gauge field occurs simply trough wilson correlators @xmath11 = { 1\\over 3 }     \\langle { \\rm tr } { \\rm p } \\exp \\ { i g   \\oint_\\gamma dx^{\\mu }      a_{\\mu } \\ }   \\rangle   \\ .",
    "\\label{eq : loop}\\ ] ] associated to loops @xmath12 made by quark or antiquark world lines and `` schwinger strings '' . in principle",
    "these correlators should determine the whole dynamics .",
    "unfortunately , due to confinement and the consequent failure of a purely perturbative approach , a consistent analytic evaluation of @xmath13 from the lagrangian alone is not possible today . however combining incomplete theoretical arguments and lattice simulation information various reasonable models can be attempted .",
    "the most naive but at the same time less arbitrary assumption consists in writing @xmath14 as the sum of its perturbative expression and an area term ( modified area law ( mal ) model ) @xmath15 where the first quantity is supposed to give correctly the short range limit the second the long range one .",
    "( [ eq : wl ] ) is our starting point . in principle",
    "any more sophisticated model could be used in the context , at the condition that it preserves certain general properties of functional derivability of the definition ( [ eq : loop ] ) . in practice not even ( [ eq : wl ] )",
    "can be treated exactly .",
    "actually we shall replace the minimal surface @xmath16 by what can be called its `` equal time straight line approximation '' , which we shall explain later .",
    "in connection with ( [ eq : wl ] ) it is convenient to consider a third type of green functions @xmath17 and @xmath18 which are obtained from @xmath9 and @xmath10 by omitting in their path integral representation contributions related to the schwinger strings . in the limit of vanishing @xmath19 or @xmath20",
    "such new quantities coincide with the original ones and are completely equivalent for what concerns the determination of bound states , condensates , chiral symmetry breaking , etc .    for @xmath17 and @xmath18 ,",
    "an inhomogeneous bethe - salpeter equation and a dyson - schwinger equation , respectively , can be derived in the configuration space , with kernel obtained as an expansion in @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "such equations can be rewritten in a more conventional form in the momentum space and as such applied e. g. to the spectrum of the mesons . to this aim in principle one",
    "should solve the ds equation first and use the resulting propagator in the bs equation . in practice a direct treatment of their full four dimensional expressions",
    "seems to be a very difficult task .",
    "however , if one neglects the pseudo - scalar mesons , a three dimensional reduction of the bs - equation seems to be appropriate .",
    "this can be obtained by standard methods in the form of an eigenvalue equation for an effective squared mass operator or simply a relativistic hamiltonian @xcite .    for the case of the pseudo - scalar mesons a complete four - dimensional treatment would be imperative .",
    "in fact the use of the free quark propagator implied in the three dimensional reduction can not be suitable in this case , for the strict interplay existing between zero mass bethe - salpeter wave function and the propagator in the chiral limit ; we shall limit to few comments .",
    "it should be mentioned that our formalism is strictly related from different point of view to to the works of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following one .",
    "we discuss the gauge invariant green functions and their path integral representations in sect .",
