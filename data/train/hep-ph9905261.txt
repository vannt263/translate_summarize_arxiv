    "recently we found rather strong evidences for existence of the light @xmath4-particle analyzing the experimental data obtained through both the scattering and the production process of @xmath12-wave @xmath3 system . in the preceding talk of this conference,@xcite ( which is referred as i in the following , )",
    "it was explained that our applied methods of the analyses are generally consistent with the unitarity of @xmath2-matrix .",
    "more specifically , the interfering amplitude(ia ) method applied in reanalysis of @xmath3 scattering phase shift satisfies the elastic unitarity , and the vmw method applied in analyses of @xmath3 production processes is consistent with the final state interaction theorem . in this",
    "talk first i collect the values of our observed property of @xmath4 meson , its mass and width .",
    "then i show this observed property of @xmath4 is consistent with that to be expected in the linear @xmath4 model .",
    "furthermore , i shall show , by investigating the background phase shift @xmath9 theoretically in the framework of linear @xmath4 model , the experimental behaviors of @xmath9 in both the @xmath1 and @xmath13 systems are quantitatively describable theoretically .",
    "_ reanalysis of @xmath3 scattering phase shift _   in the ia method the total phase shift @xmath14 is represented by the sum of component phase shift , @xmath15 and @xmath9 . in the actual analysis",
    "the @xmath9 was taken phenomenologically of hard core type : @xmath16 we analyzed the data of `` standard phase shift '' @xmath17 between @xmath3- and k@xmath18-thresholds and also the data on upper and lower bounds reported so far ( see ref.@xcite in detail ) .",
    "the results of the analyses are given in fig .",
    "2 of i , and we concluded that the @xmath4 meson exists with the property , @xmath19    as explained in i , the fit with @xmath20 corresponds to the conventional analyses without the repulsive @xmath9 . in the present analysis with @xmath9 the greatly improved @xmath21 value 23.6 is obtained for standard @xmath14 , compared with that of the conventional analysis , 163.4 .",
    "the similar @xmath21 improvement is also obtained for the upper and lower phase shifts . in the present(conventional )",
    "analysis is @xmath22 . for lower phase shift @xmath23 .",
    "] this fact strongly suggests the existence of light @xmath4 meson phenomenologically.[multiblock footnote omitted ] + _ analyses of @xmath3 production processes _   we also analyzed the data of @xmath3 production processes , _",
    "pp _ central collision experiment by gams and @xmath7 decay reported by dm2 collabration , and showed the possible evidence of the existence of the @xmath4 particle . in the analyses we applied the vmw method , where the production amplitude is represented by a sum of the @xmath4 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 breit - wigner amplitudes with relative phase factors . for detailed analyses ,",
    "the obtained mass and width of @xmath4 are @xmath26",
    "now the property of @xmath4 meson obtained above is checked from the viewpoint of chiral symmetry . in the @xmath8 linear @xmath4 model(l@xmath4 m ) the coupling constant @xmath27 of the @xmath28 interaction is related to @xmath29 of the @xmath30 interaction and @xmath31 as @xmath32 thus , the @xmath33 is related with @xmath31 through the following equation : @xmath34 substituting the experimental @xmath31=535@xmath35675 mev given in eq .",
    "( [ eqexp ] ) and @xmath36=93 mev into eq.([eqmw ] ) , we can predict @xmath37 which is consistent with the @xmath38 given in eq.([eqexp ] ) .",
    "thus the observed @xmath4 meson may be identified with the @xmath4 meson described in the l@xmath4 m .",
    "_ experimental phase shift and repulsive core in the i=2 system _   in our phase shift analyses of the @xmath1 @xmath3 system the @xmath39 of hard core type introduced phenomenologically played an essential role . in the @xmath13 @xmath3 system , there is no known / expected resonance , and accordingly it is expected that the phase shift of repulsive core type will appear directly . as shown in fig .  1 , actually the experimental data@xcite from the threshold to @xmath40 mev of the @xmath13 @xmath3-scattering @xmath2-wave phase shift @xmath41 are apparently negative , and fitted well also by the hard - core formula @xmath42 with the core radius of @xmath43 ( 0.17 fm )",
    ". +    = 4.0 cm    _ origin of the @xmath9 _   the origin of this @xmath39 seems to have a close connection to the @xmath10-interaction in l@xmath4m@xcite : it represents a contact zero - range interaction and is strongly repulsive both in the @xmath1 and 2 systems , and has plausible properties as the origin of repulsive core .    the @xmath3-scattering @xmath44-amplitude by @xmath8 l@xmath4 m is given by @xmath45 because of the relation ( [ eqrel ] ) , the dominant part of the amplitude due to virtual @xmath4 production ( 1st term ) is cancelled by that due to repulsive @xmath10 interaction ( 2nd term ) in @xmath46 level , and the @xmath44 is rewritten into the following form : @xmath47 where in the last side the @xmath48 tomozawa - weinberg amplitude and the @xmath49 ( and higher order ) correction term are left . as a result the derivative coupling property of @xmath50-meson as a nambu - goldstone boson is preserved . in this sense",
    "the @xmath10-interaction can be called a  compensating \" interaction for @xmath4-effect .",
    "thus the strong cancellation between the positive @xmath51 and the negative @xmath39 in our analysis leading to the @xmath4 , as shown in fig .",
    "2 of i , is reducible to the relation eq.([eq : acancel ] ) in l@xmath4 m .    in the following",
    "we shall make a theoretical estimate of @xmath9 in the framework of l@xmath4 m .",
    "the scattering @xmath52 matrix consists of a resonance part @xmath53 and of a background part @xmath54 .",
    "the @xmath54 corresponds to the contact @xmath30 interaction and the exchange of the relevant resonances .",
    "the main term of @xmath54 comes from the @xmath10 interaction .",
    "this @xmath54 has a weak @xmath55-dependence in comparison with that of @xmath53 .",
    "the explicit form of @xmath54 for @xmath1 and @xmath13 @xmath2-wave channels are given by @xmath56 where @xmath57 for @xmath1 and @xmath58 for @xmath13 .",
    "here we introduced the @xmath11 meson contribution , which are supposed to be described by schwinger - weinberg lagrangian , interaction appearing in schwinger -weinberg lagrangian makes eq.([eq9 ] ) divergent .",

    "one subtraction is necessary , @xmath64 we adopt the subtraction condition takes the same value as the one obtained by simple @xmath65 matrix unitarization at the resonance energy @xmath66 . ] @xmath67 the @xmath31 is fixed with the value of the best fit , 0.585 gev ; and the values of @xmath68 and @xmath69 are determined from the experimental property of @xmath11 meson ; the obtained @xmath70 is shown in fig .",
    "= 5.0 cm    the @xmath55-dependence of the theoretical @xmath9 by l@xmath4 m including @xmath11 meson contribution is almost consistent with the phenomenological @xmath9 of hard core type . concerning on our analysis of @xmath71 , pennington made a criticism@xcite that the form of @xmath9 is completely arbitrary .",
    "however , as shown in fig .",
    "2 , our phenomenological @xmath9 , eq.([eq2 ] ) , is almost consistent with the theoretical prediction by l@xmath4 m .",
    "thus , the criticism is not valid .",
    "we have shortly summarized the properties of the light @xmath4 meson `` observed '' in a series of our recent works .",
    "the obtained values of mass and width of @xmath4 satisfy the relation predicted by l@xmath4 m .",
    "this fact suggests the linear representation of chiral symmetry is realized in nature . + in our phase shift analysis there occurrs a strong cancellation between @xmath51 due to the @xmath4 resonance and @xmath9 , which is guaranteed by chiral symmetry .",

    "finally i give a comment : by the analysis of @xmath72 @xmath2-wave @xmath73 scattering phase shift in a similar method , the existence of @xmath74 particle with a broad ( @xmath75 mev ) width is suggested .",
