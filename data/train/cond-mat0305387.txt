    "quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations for models with electron - phonon coupling are often limited in both system size and accessible parameter range by long autocorrelation times and large statistical errors .",
    "this makes it very difficult to study realistic models for , e.g. , the high temperature superconductors or the manganites which exhibit colossal magnetoresistance . in both classes of materials",
    "electron - phonon interactions play an important role.@xcite although classical treatments of phonons have been quite successful in certain situations,@xcite e.g. , at high - enough temperatures , quantum effects are expected to be relevant.@xcite consequently , it is highly desirable to develop a new , more efficient method to treat the phonon degrees of freedom quantum mechanically .",
    "the holstein molecular - crystal model constitutes one of the simplest models for coupled electron - phonon systems , and therefore serves as an ideal testing ground for new approaches .",
    "moreover , despite enormous theoretical efforts , even the physics of the holstein model is still not completely understood .",
    "the extensive use of qmc methods to study many - body problems is based on the fact that they can give quasiexact results ( i.e. , exact apart from statistical errors which can be made arbitrarily small , in principle ) . over the years",
    ", several different qmc methods have been developed to study systems with electron - phonon coupling , such as the holstein,@xcite the frhlich , @xcite or the su - schrieffer - heeger ( ssh ) model.@xcite a very general qmc method for coupled fermion - boson models was developed by blankenbecler _",
    "et al._@xcite and scalapino and sugar.@xcite it is based on an analytic integration over the fermion degrees of freedom and a mc simulation of the resulting boson model .",
    "the simulation is performed using the grand - canonical ensemble and requires the evaluation of a fermion determinant involving a computation time which is proportional to the cube of the system size . moreover ,",
    "the method in its original form becomes unstable at low temperatures . while the simulations of refs .   and",
    "were restricted to one dimension , levine and su@xcite and , using a stabilized version of the same algorithm , niyaz _",
    "et al._@xcite studied charge - density - wave formation and superconductivity in the two - dimensional holstein model .",
    "a numerically faster method is the world - line algorithm developed by hirsch _",
    "et al._@xcite based on a special breakup of the hamiltonian and a fixed number of fermions .",
    "this results in configuration weights which are simple to evaluate allowing for much bigger system sizes . in the course of the simulation , both fermions and bosons are sampled simultaneously .",
    "the latter method has been successfully applied to the holstein polaron problem and to the half - filled ssh and holstein model.@xcite however the world - line algorithm is restricted to models in one spatial dimension or to the single - electron case in any dimension by the minus - sign problem.@xcite scalettar _",

    "this work was extended to the low - temperature regime by noack _",
    "et al._@xcite finally , marsiglio@xcite developed a low - temperature qmc method to study the same model , also at half filling .",
    "de raedt and lagendijk@xcite and kornilovitch@xcite used an alternative approach based on feynman s path - integral method,@xcite where the boson degrees of freedom are integrated out analytically and the resulting fermionic model is simulated using qmc .",
    "although the method is limited to one electron or two electrons of opposite spin@xcite by the sign problem , it allows efficient simulations in one , two , and three dimensions even for small phonon frequencies near the adiabatic limit , and has also been used to investigate the holstein model with dispersive phonons.@xcite also using feynman s path integral , kornilovitch and pike@xcite developed a qmc method which exploits the conservation of the total quasimomentum of the system and allows the calculation of dynamical properties such as , e.g. , the polaron band structure .",
    "although the method is not restricted to a certain model or dimensionality of the system , it suffers from large statistical errors .",
    "moreover , it is limited to the case of a single fermion at very low temperature , and exhibits a sign problem for nonzero total quasimomentum even in one dimension .",
    "prokofev and svistunov@xcite and mischenko _",
    "et al._@xcite used qmc to directly sample the zero - temperature one - electron green function of the frhlich polaron in imaginary time .",
    "the method allows calculations for an infinite system in three dimensions , but requires a convergent series for the electron propagator .",
    "while all but the last method mentioned so far make use of the trotter - suzuki approximation,@xcite kornilovitch@xcite developed a continuous - time algorithm that works in any dimension and allows calculations on infinite systems .",
    "it gives directly dynamical quantities such as the polaron spectrum and effective mass with very high accuracy .",
    "however , similar to previous work,@xcite it is restricted to the one - electron limit at very low temperatures .",
    "moreover , calculations for small phonon frequencies and/or weak electron - phonon coupling are difficult and a sign problem appears for nonzero total quasimomentum .",
    "the projector qmc method@xcite in combination with a local updating of the phonon degrees of freedom has been used by berger _",
    "et al._@xcite to investigate the holstein - hubbard model at various band fillings , and green function qmc simulations for the half - filled holstein model of spinless fermions have been performed by mckenzie _",
    "et al._@xcite finally , the stochastic series expansion mc technique has been applied recently to an extended , one - dimensional hubbard model with an electron - phonon interaction of the ssh type.@xcite in contrast to other work , the phonons are treated in second quantization .",
    "although the method allows simulations on large lattices in one dimension , it relies on an upper limit for the number of phonons at each site which makes it difficult to study the regime of small phonon frequencies and/or strong coupling .",
    "in addition to the specific shortcomings of each method such as , e.g. , the restriction to a single fermion , or to one spatial dimension , or to zero temperature , all previous simulations of the holstein model were limited to some extent by autocorrelations . if the phonon degrees of freedom are not integrated out analytically , these correlations predominantly come from the free harmonic - oscillator dynamics , especially in the adiabatic regime of small phonon frequency .",
    "this often leads to an enormous computational effort even for rather small systems and intermediate temperatures .    in this paper",
    "we first present a simple variational approach using a generalized form of the lang - firsov transformation which , in the one - electron case considered here , gives surprisingly good results and yields valuable insight into the mechanism of polaron formation .",
    "the full hamiltonian resulting from the standard version of the canonical lang - firsov transformation is then used as the starting point for a qmc method which is free of any uncontrolled approximations . due to the fact that the lang - firsov transformation contains the crucial electronic influences on the phonons ,",
    "the monte carlo simulation for the phonon degrees of freedom can be based only on the purely phononic part of the transformed hamiltonian .",
    "the electronic contributions can then be allowed for by reweighting of the probability distribution , corresponding to an exact treatment of the fermion degrees of freedom .",
    "this enables us to completely ignore the electronic weights in the updating process , and thereby dramatically reduce the computational effort .",
    "finally , we introduce a principal component representation of the phonon coordinates , which allows exact sampling of the phonons and avoids all autocorrelations .",

    "the holstein model has been introduced in the 1950s,@xcite and describes a system of tight - binding conduction electrons coupled to a dispersionless phonon mode .",
    "if we express the phonon operators in terms of their natural units , the hamiltonian takes the form @xmath0 here @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) creates ( annihilates ) an electron of spin @xmath3 at lattice site @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 denote the displacement and momentum of a harmonic oscillator at site @xmath4 , and @xmath7 with @xmath8 . the last term @xmath9 describes the local coupling of the dispersionless einstein phonons to the electron density @xmath10 . in the first term , the symbol @xmath11 denotes a summation over all nearest - neighbor hopping pairs @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the parameters of the model are the hopping integral @xmath14 , the phonon energy @xmath15 , and the electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath16 .",
    "we introduce the commonly used dimensionless coupling constant @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the bare bandwidth in @xmath19 dimensions .",
    "we also define the dimensionless phonon frequency @xmath20 and express all energies in units of @xmath14 .",
    "thus the model depends on two independent parameters , @xmath21 and @xmath22 . throughout this paper",
    "periodic boundary conditions in real space are assumed .",
    "the holstein model has been investigated intensively in the past , using a large variety of methods . due to the large amount of literature available",
    "we restrict the discussion to the case of a single electron in an otherwise empty lattice with which this paper is concerned .",
    "the latter is generally known as the holstein polaron problem and still constitutes a complicated many - body problem .",
    "weak - coupling perturbation theory has been found to be accurate only for very small coupling strengths @xmath22 when the phonon frequency is low.@xcite in the strong - coupling regime , an adiabatic small - polaron approximation@xcite has been found to work extremely well for small values of @xmath21 ( ref .  ) , while a perturbation theory based on the lang - firsov transformation@xcite gives accurate results for @xmath23 ( refs .   and  ) .",
    "discrepancies remain , however , in the regime of intermediate coupling and phonon frequency.@xcite to bridge this gap , a lot of numerical work has been done using exact diagonalization ( ed ) methods , density - matrix renormalization - group ( dmrg ) studies , qmc methods and variational methods .",
    "ed is limited in the accessible parameter range , since it requires a truncation of the hilbert space associated with the phonon degrees of freedom . with increasing electron - phonon coupling strength , for example",
    ", more and more phonon states have to be included to obtain converged results,@xcite which makes it difficult to study clusters of reasonable size in the strong or even intermediate coupling regime , especially for small phonon frequencies . at this point calculations based on dmrg",
    "set in , which use an optimized phonon basis to reduce the size of the hilbert space.@xcite another possible approach are the so - called cluster methods which exploit exact information on small clusters to obtain approximate results for infinite systems.@xcite moreover , a number of variational methods have been developed which give very accurate results over a wide range of parameters.@xcite as discussed in sec .  [ sec : introduction ] , various qmc methods have been developed for the holstein model .",
    "the polaron problem considered here has been investigated by hirsch _",
    "et al._,@xcite de raedt and lagendijk,@xcite kornilovitch,@xcite kornilovitch and pike,@xcite kornilovitch,@xcite and mishchenko _",
    "et al._@xcite finally , the holstein polaron has also been studied in the infinite - dimensional limit using dynamical mean - field theory.@xcite    for the one - dimensional case , on which we will focus here ,",
    "the general picture emerging from these investigations is as follows ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) .",
    "starting from the noninteracting system ( @xmath24 ) the electron is gradually dressed with a coherent multi - phonon cloud as the coupling increases . for @xmath25 and @xmath26 the resulting quasiparticle remains in a bloch - like state , with the phonon cloud giving rise to an increased effective mass . in the strong - coupling regime ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) the electron becomes self - trapped by the induced lattice distortion and this object ",
    "trapped electron plus distortion  is usually called a small polaron . the transition from weak to strong coupling",
    "is continuous,@xcite and the term `` large polaron '' is often used to describe an electron dressed with a phonon cloud extending over more than one lattice site .",
    "the polaronic effects become more dominant as the phonon frequency approaches the adiabatic limit @xmath29 . in qmc simulations , small values of @xmath21 introduce two very different time scales for the evolution of electrons and phonons , respectively .",
    "this gives rise to the problems mentioned above and , in fact , many qmc simulations have been done only for @xmath30 .",
    "the canonical lang - firsov transformation@xcite has been used extensively to study the polaron problem . a well - known approximation due to holstein@xcite consists of replacing the transformed hopping term by its expectation value with respect to a zero - phonon state , thus neglecting phonon emission and absorption during the hopping process .",
    "this approximation , which we shall call the holstein - lang - firsov ( hlf ) approximation , was found to give reliable results only in the strong - coupling and/or nonadiabatic limit @xmath31 ( refs .  ,   and  ) .",
    "more refined approaches based on strong - coupling perturbation theory provide an accurate description of the holstein polaron over a large range of parameters.@xcite in the limit @xmath32 , the hopping term in hamiltonian  ( [ eq : holstein ] ) can be neglected , and the lang - firsov transformation allows an exact solution of the resulting single - site problem.@xcite the transformation has also been used in combination with numerical methods.@xcite however we are not aware of any qmc simulation based on the transformed model .",
    "we define the unitary operator @xmath33 where @xmath4 and @xmath34 run over lattice sites , and with real parameters @xmath35 . @xmath36 as defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : u ] ) has the form of a translation operator . given an electron at lattice site @xmath4 , it corresponds to a displacement of the harmonic oscillators at all sites @xmath34 , @xmath37 , by @xmath35 .",
    "hence the transformation describes a nonlocal phonon cloud surrounding an electron .",
    "this corresponds to the well - known concept of a large polaron , which extends over more than one lattice site . using the transformation @xmath38 we find for the transformed operators @xmath39 inserting these results into eq .",
    "( [ eq : holstein ] ) , the transformed hamiltonian becomes @xmath40 here the term @xmath41 describes the coupling between electrons and phonons , while @xmath42 represents an effective electron - electron interaction .",
    "the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : htilde ] ) will be the starting point for the variational polaron approach presented in the following section .    a more suitable approach for qmc simulations , however , is given by requiring that the electron - phonon terms cancel .",
    "then @xmath43 with @xmath44 and we obtain the standard lang - firsov transformation with the transformation operator @xmath45 in contrast to the extended polaron cloud , defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : u ] ) , now only the oscillator at the site of the electron is affected .",
    "the transformed hamiltonian reads @xmath46 in the hlf or small - polaron approximation , the ground state of the transformed hamiltonian is approximated by leaving all phonons in the ground state .",
    "it has been shown@xcite that the small - polaron wave function becomes exact in the strong - coupling , nonadiabatic limit , and agrees qualitatively with the exact results also in the intermediate coupling regime . as discussed by zhang _",
    "et al._,@xcite the hlf approximation gives an overestimated shift of the equilibrium position of the oscillator in the presence of an electron , and does not reproduce the retardation effects when an electron hops onto a previously unoccupied site .",
    "nevertheless , the local lattice distortion at the site of the electron contains the crucial impact of the electron on the lattice .",
    "consequently , the transformed hamiltonian  ( [ eq : lfhamiltonian ] ) should be a good starting point to perform qmc simulations , which merely need to simulate small fluctuations around the zero - point motion .",
    "indeed we will see in sec .  [",
    "sec : resqmc ] that the expectation values of the phonon operators in the transformed holstein model remain close to the results of the free - oscillator case over the whole range of the electron - phonon coupling .",
    "this makes sampling of the phonon degrees of freedom much more efficient . in principle",
    ", it would also be possible to develop a qmc algorithm starting with hamiltonian  ( [ eq : htilde ] ) , with the parameters @xmath35 being determined by the variational method discussed in the following section .",
    "however , we will see that the simple ( local ) lang - firsov transformation is already sufficient to obtain a very efficient qmc method .    from eq .",
    "( [ eq : lfhamiltonian ] ) it is obvious that the standard lang - firsov transformation on the one hand removes the electron - phonon coupling term , but on the other hand introduces complex valued hopping integrals which depend on the phonon momenta at the lattice sites involved in the hopping process .",
    "moreover , for more than one electron in the system , the last term @xmath47 introduces a hubbard - like attractive interaction . in the case of the extended transformation ,",
    "the electron - phonon interaction term can not be eliminated entirely , the hopping term involves all phonon momenta @xmath48 as well as the parameters @xmath35 , and the electron - electron interaction becomes long ranged . for these reasons",
    "it is expedient to base the qmc simulation on the local lang - firsov transformation  ( [ eq : lfhamiltonian ] ) .    for simplicity ,",
    "we restrict ourselves in the present study to the case of a single electron so that @xmath49 . the electron - electron interaction term in hamiltonian  ( [ eq : htilde ] ) becomes @xmath50 while the corresponding term in the local lang - firsov transformation [ last term of hamiltonian  ( [ eq : lfhamiltonian ] ) ] reduces to @xmath51 equations  ( [ eq : iee1 ] ) and  ( [ eq : ep ] ) both describe a shift in energy resulting from the original electron - electron interaction which is usually called the polaron binding energy @xmath52 .",
    "here we present a simple variational method which is based on the extended transformation discussed in the preceding section .",
    "similar work along these lines using different transformations of the hamiltonian as well as physically motivated wave functions can be found , for example , in refs .  ,  , and  . as discussed above",
    ", the zero - phonon ansatz of the simple hlf approximation gives reliable results only in the limit of large @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "whereas in hlf the parameter @xmath53 of the lang - firsov transformation is chosen such that the electron - phonon coupling term @xmath41 vanishes , in the variational polaron approach ( vpa ) , we treat the @xmath35 as variational parameters which are determined by minimizing the ground - state energy in a zero - phonon basis . like the hlf approximation ,",
    "the vpa becomes exact in the weak - coupling limit @xmath54 and in the nonadiabatic strong - coupling limit @xmath55 .",
    "we will see in sec .",
    "[ sec : resvpa ] that the vpa also gives very accurate results for large phonon frequencies , @xmath23 .",
    "this can easily be understood keeping in mind the discussion of the validity of the hlf approximation given in the preceding section .",
    "while the hlf ansatz overestimates the displacement of the local oscillator in the presence of an electron , the vpa determines this shift variationally .",
    "moreover , the missing retardation effects in the response of the oscillator to an electron hopping onto the site become negligible for large phonon frequencies .",
    "therefore , in addition to the cases stated above , the vpa also becomes exact in the nonadiabatic limit @xmath56 .",
    "although the limitations of the vpa in or near the adiabatic regime will clearly emerge when we discuss results in sec .",
    "[ sec : resvpa ] , it works surprisingly well if we keep in mind the simplicity of the method .",
    "moreover , the reasons for the failure of the vpa in certain parameter regimes are physically clear and can easily be interpreted .    for translationally invariant systems the _ displacement fields _ satisfy the condition @xmath57 .",
    "inserting this relation into eq .",
    "( [ eq : iee1 ] ) , the expression inside the brackets becomes independent of the index @xmath4 . for the single electron case with @xmath58 we have @xmath59    we solve the eigenvalue problem of the transformed hamiltonian  ( [ eq : htilde ] ) in a zero - phonon basis for which we make the ansatz @xmath60 where @xmath61 denotes the ground state of the harmonic oscillator at site @xmath62 . for simplicity , we restrict ourselves to one dimension , although the method can easily be extended to higher dimensions .",
    "the matrix elements of the hopping term in this basis are @xmath63 where @xmath64 is nonzero for nearest - neighbor hopping pairs @xmath65 and @xmath66 is the harmonic - oscillator ground - state wave function in coordinate space .",

    "equation  ( [ eq : gammap ] ) has a typical random - phase approximation form , which is reasonable since a variational ansatz for the wave function of the untransformed hamiltonian can be written as [ see also eq .",

    "[ sec : resvpa ] .",
    "in contrast to the approximate variational approach presented in the preceding section , the qmc method discussed here is based on the exact lang - firsov transformation of the holstein hamiltonian . therefore , the method is exact apart from statistical errors and trotter discretization , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : introduction ] .",
    "we begin with the evaluation of the partition function @xmath90 , with @xmath91 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : lfhamiltonian ] ) . as indicated in the preceding section , for the case of a single electron , the last term in hamiltonian  ( [ eq : lfhamiltonian ] ) represents a constant energy shift .",
    "moreover we can drop spin indices and are left with the hamiltonian @xmath92 the polaron binding energy given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : ep ] ) can be neglected during the qmc simulation , and needs only to be considered in calculating the total energy . for simplicity",
    ", we only consider the one - dimensional case here , although the generalization to higher dimensions is a simple matter .",

    "we derive the approximation for the partition function @xmath97 where @xmath98 .",

    "the exponential of the hopping term may in the single - electron case be written as @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the @xmath111 tight - binding hopping matrix .",
    "thus we have the same matrix @xmath112 for every time slice , which is transformed by the diagonal unitary matrices @xmath113 . in our one - electron case ,",

    "in contrast , the fermionic weight requires the evaluation of the @xmath96 fold matrix product appearing in the definition of @xmath115 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : omega ] ) . the numerical effort for the calculation of @xmath134",
    "may be reduced by varying @xmath135 sequentially from 1 to @xmath96 instead of picking random values . in this case",
    "the calculation of the new fermionic weight , after the change of a single phonon momentum , can be reduced to only two matrix multiplications .",
    "similar to other mc methods , a warm - up phase at the beginning of the simulation would be required for each set of parameters .",
    "an additional difficulty arises from the fact that , for the transformed model , the fermionic weight @xmath134 is no longer strictly positive , even for the case of a single electron in one dimension .",
    "this is a consequence of the complex - valued hopping integrals , in contrast to simulations of , e.g. , the hubbard model , where a minus - sign problem occurs as a consequence of the fermi statistics of the electrons.@xcite here the average sign of @xmath134 is smallest in the regime of small phonon frequency and low temperature .",
    "the sign problem is most pronounced for intermediate values of the electron - phonon coupling strength @xmath22 , where the cross over from a large to a small polaron occurs .",
    "however , in one dimension , it is not severe and reduces with increasing system size .",
    "for example , calculations in the most critical regime @xmath136 , @xmath137 , and @xmath138 have shown that @xmath139 increases from about 0.5 for @xmath140 to about 0.85 for @xmath141 .",
    "nevertheless , it remains to be seen to what extent the number of electrons and the dimensionality of the system affect the situation .",
    "a related qmc approach to the original holstein hamiltonian  ( [ eq : holstein ] ) involves a very similar derivation@xcite to obtain the partition function , also in the one - electron limit .",
    "in fact the bosonic action @xmath142 takes exactly the same form , with @xmath143 replaced by @xmath144 .",
    "the main difference is the fermionic part of the partition function , contained in the matrix @xmath115 .",
    "while the lang - firsov transformation leads to a complicated hopping term , the standard approach for the untransformed model only includes the bare hopping operator given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : holstein ] ) . however , an interaction term @xmath9 [ cf .",
    "( [ eq : holstein ] ) ] appears , which contains the phonon coordinate @xmath145 .",
    "hence the matrix @xmath115 is replaced by @xmath146 and the path integral in the partition function [ eq .  ( [ eq : z ] ) ] is over all coordinates @xmath144 instead of the momenta @xmath143 .",
    "apart from the fact that the coordinates @xmath144 are sampled instead of the phonon momenta , the qmc procedure for the untransformed model is identical to the simulation described above . we shall refer to this less sophisticated qmc method for the original holstein hamiltonian as the _ standard approach .",
    "_ for @xmath147 ,",
    "i.e. , no electron - phonon coupling , we have a set of @xmath148 independent harmonic oscillators , and both approaches are alike .",
    "let us briefly consider the noninteracting limit , in which the partition function can be written as @xmath149 . as discussed by batrouni and scalettar,@xcite the difficulties encountered in qmc simulations , even for",
    "the simple case of a single ( @xmath150 ) harmonic oscillator , arise from the large condition number , i.e. , the ratio of largest to smallest eigenvalue , of the bosonic action @xmath142 . for small values of @xmath151",
    "this ratio is proportional to @xmath152 ( ref .  ) , leading to autocorrelation times which grow quadratically with decreasing phonon frequency and the number @xmath96 of trotter times .",
    "the physical reason for these correlations becomes obvious if we look at the bosonic action [ eq .",

    "when the electron hops from site a ( with a displaced oscillator corresponding to a small polaron ) , say , to a neighboring , previously unoccupied site b ( with the oscillator in its undisplaced ground state ) during a qmc simulation , the current phonon configuration is no longer energetically favorable .",
    "clearly , the oscillator at site a has to return to its undisplaced ground state , while a corresponding phonon cloud has to be built up at site b. such distortions of the lattice in the presence of an electron are large compared to the zero - point motion of the oscillator .",
    "on the other hand , only small changes of the current configuration will be accepted in the simulation .",
    "consequently it takes an enormous number of single updates to obtain the new configuration in which the polaron has completely moved to site b. obviously these polaron effects also give rise to strongly autocorrelated configurations , thereby dramatically increasing the numerical effort for the simulation .",
    "these problems due to polaron formation can be overcome by using the lang - firsov transformed model .",

    "[ sec : lang - firs - transf ] ) , the result for @xmath306 as a function of @xmath22 is the same in the untransformed holstein model .",
    "however , the significant advantage of the proposed method is that the phonon momenta are sampled instead of the coordinates @xmath144 .",
    "thus the probability distribution associated with the degrees of freedom to be sampled has only a small variance compared to the standard method , which makes the simulations much more effective .",
    "the dependence of @xmath308 on the coupling strength @xmath22 and the temperature has first been studied by ranninger and thibblin@xcite for the two - site polaron problem .",
    "for such a small system , the minimum of @xmath306 is even more pronounced , while for larger systems the average effect of the electron on a local oscillator is more and more washed out .",
    "ranninger and thibblin@xcite ascribed the deviation of the vibrational energy from the free - oscillator result to anharmonic effects , which are visible only at low enough temperatures .",

    "we conclude this section with a discussion of the performance of the qmc approach . from the results presented above it",
    "is obvious that the method enables us to study a very wide range of parameters .",
    "hence , for example , we have performed calculations for @xmath309 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ek_var_w ] ) . simulations in the adiabatic regime would be extremely difficult within the standard approach , since the autocorrelation times grow as @xmath152 .",
    "however , in materials such as the manganites , the frequencies of the relevant phonon modes are known to be small ( @xmath291 , see , e.g. , ref .  ) so that our method could represent an important step forward towards the simulation of electron - phonon models with realistic parameters . also , we are able to reach very low temperatures @xmath310 and clusters large enough to avoid finite - size effects with modest computational effort .",
    "another key advantage is that the method becomes more and more efficient as the coupling strength @xmath22 increases , which is due to the use of the lang - firsov transformation . in our results",
    "we find that statistical errors of expectation values of phonon operators are larger than , e.g. , the errors of the kinetic energy .",
    "finally , the errors increase slightly as we approach the adiabatic and/or low - temperature regime @xmath311 and @xmath312 , respectively .    to demonstrate the efficiency of our method we give some figures for the cpu time of the simulations .",
    "a typical qmc run for 32 lattice sites , @xmath227 , @xmath250 , and @xmath158 ( i.e. , near the small - polaron crossover ) only takes 5 min of cpu time on a 650 mhz pentium iii pc .",
    "for such a run relative errors of , for example , the kinetic energy are less than 1.0% . away from the crossover point",
    ", the same accuracy can be obtained within a few seconds . for @xmath136 , the temperature used in most of the calculations presented in this paper , a qmc run with @xmath22 near the crossover value and with similar statistical errors as mentioned above takes about 80 min of cpu time .",
    "hence , although not as efficient as the specialized one - electron methods,@xcite our approach significantly reduces the numerical effort compared to previous methods which were often run on supercomputers and did not reach the parameters ( low temperature and small phonon frequency ) and accuracy of our simulations .",
    "we have presented a simple variational approach to the holstein model , which incorporates an extended lang - firsov transformation .",
    "this approach is easily applicable to infinite systems and represents a marked improvement over the standard small - polaron approximation , which is only useful in the nonadiabatic , strong - coupling regime .",
    "more importantly , we have introduced an exact qmc method for the holstein model , which is based on the standard lang - firsov transformation of the hamiltonian .",
    "the phonon momenta are represented in terms of principal components , which enables us to sample completely uncorrelated configurations , while the electronic degrees of freedom are taken into account exactly by use of a reweighting method for calculating observables .",
    "thereby , we avoid the numerically expensive evaluation of the electronic weights in the updating process . the present approach can be applied for a wide range of parameters with relatively small computational effort .",
    "in particular , efficient simulations can be performed in the adiabatic regime @xmath156 , which is of special interest in connection with materials such as the manganites . in the one - dimensional case considered here ,",
    "a sign problem resulting from the lang - firsov transformation on small systems has been found to have only a small effect on the statistics .",
    "tests have been presented in the one - electron case and reveal that the method reproduces lanczos diagonalization results in the regime where the latter are applicable , namely , for very small systems , small to moderate electron - phonon coupling and for sufficiently large phonon frequency . moreover , a satisfactory agreement with other methods has been found . owing to the exact treatment of the electronic degrees of freedom and the sampling of the phonons ,",
    "the method is free of any autocorrelations .",
    "the use of the lang - firsov transformation , which is essential for the applicability of the reweighting method , substantially improves the statistics , allowing for very accurate results .    despite the great computational efficiency of our method compared to the standard approach ,",
    "even faster methods exist .",
    "for example , the qmc simulations of de raedt and lagendijk@xcite and kornilovitch@xcite seem to be numerically faster due to the analytic integration over the phonon degrees of freedom which significantly reduces statistical errors .",
    "however , both methods are restricted in their applicability as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : introduction ] .",
    "in particular , an extension to many - electron systems seems impossible , since simulations will be restricted by a severe minus sign problem similar to other world - line methods .",
    "in contrast , the method presented here is not restricted to the single - electron limit in principle , although some modifications will be necessary . as pointed out in previous sections ,",
    "most of the ideas proposed here , such as the use of the transformed model , the reweighting method , and the pc representation , remain unchanged if we consider more than one electron .",
    "the required modifications concern mainly the fermionic weight @xmath134 [ eq .  ( [ eq : omega ] ) ] .",
    "there is a hubbard - like interaction term coming from the lang - firsov transformation ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : lang - firs - transf ] ) , and the one - electron basis states used here ( eq .  ( [ eq : oneelbasis ] )",
    "have to be replaced by the corresponding set of many - electron states .",
    "since the number of such basis states , and thereby the linear dimension of the matrices @xmath115 , @xmath112 , and @xmath313 ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : qmci ] ) , grows exponentially with the system size , an exact treatment of the fermion degrees of freedom will become increasingly difficult .",
    "consequently , a more refined approach based on , e.g. , the use of determinant methods will be required . for the bipolaron problem of two electrons with opposite spin ,",
    "on which work is currently in progress , the computational effort can be significantly reduced by exploiting the conservation of the total quasimomentum ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) , leading to a computer time that grows with the cube of the system size . the more general case of ,",
    "e.g. , a quarter - filled band corresponding to the colossal magnetoresistance regime of the manganites , requires further consideration , and the effect of the sign problem remains to be investigated .",
    "moreover , the performance of such an approach has to be compared to existing many - electron qmc methods for the holstein model .",
    "finally , the method can be generalized to more complicated models including , e.g. , a coupling of the electrons to local spins as in the kondo or double - exchange model for the manganites .",
