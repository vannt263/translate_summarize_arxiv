    "cassiopeia  a ( hereafter , cas  a ) is the youngest known supernova remnant ( snr ) in the milky way , located at a distance of 3.4@xmath11  @xmath12 @xcite . the estimate of the supernova is a.d .",
    "1671.3@xmath30.9 , based on the proper motion of several ejecta knots @xcite . however , an event observed by flamsteed ( a.d .",
    "1680 ) could be at the origin of the cas  a remnant @xcite .",
    "the large collection of data from observations in the radio , infra - red , optical , x - ray  ( see hwang 2004 ) up to tev @xmath2-rays  @xcite allows us to study its morphology , composition , cosmic - ray acceleration efficiency and secular evolution in details .",
    "young snrs are thought to be efficient particle accelerators and represent the main galactic production sites of heavy nuclei , some of them being radioactives .",
    "soft @xmath2-ray  observations , beyond the thermal x - ray  emission ( @xmath13 10  @xmath0 ) , can therefore provide invaluable information in both of these areas by studying the nonthermal continuum and the @xmath2-ray  line emission .",
    "cas  a then appears to be the best case for such investigations .",
    "few radioactive isotopes are accessible to @xmath2-ray  astronomy for probing cosmic nucleosynthesis @xcite . amongst them",
    ", @xmath1ti is a key isotope for the investigation of the inner regions of core - collapse sne and their young remnants .",
    "this nucleus is thought to be exclusively created in sne but with a large variation of yields depending on their type .",
    "recent accurate measurements by several independent groups give a weighted - average @xmath1ti lifetime of 86.0 @xmath3 0.5 years @xcite .",
    "the discovery of the 1157  @xmath0 @xmath1ca @xmath2-ray line emission from the decay chain of @xmath1ti ( @xmath14ti@xmath15@xmath14sc@xmath15@xmath14ca ) with _",
    "cgro_/comptel @xcite was the first direct proof that this short - lived isotope is indeed produced in sne .",
    "this has been strengthened by the _ bepposax_/pds detection of the two blended low energy @xmath1sc lines at 67.9  @xmath0 and 78.4  @xmath0 @xcite . by combining both observations , vink ( 2001 )",
    "deduced a @xmath1ti yield of ( 1.5@xmath31.0 ) @xmath4 10@xmath9 m@xmath10 .",
    "this high value compared to those predicted by `` standard '' models ( woosley & weaver 1995b , ww95 ; thielemann , nomoto , & hashimoto 1996 , tnh96 ) as well as improved ones @xcite could be due to several effects .",
    "first of all , the explosion of cas  a seems to have been intrinsically asymmetric since such asymmetries have recently been observed in the ejecta @xcite , and there are indications that its explosion energy was @xmath16 2 @xmath4 10@xmath17 erg @xcite , higher than the canonical value of 10@xmath17 erg .",
    "the sensitivity of the @xmath1ti production to the explosion energy and asymmetries may explain the high @xmath1ti yield compared to explosion models @xcite .",
    "it is generally accepted that cas  a was formed by the explosion of a massive progenitor , from a 16 m@xmath10 single star @xcite to a wolf - rayet ( wr ) remnant of a very massive ( @xmath18 60 m@xmath10 ) precursor @xcite .",
    "type ib explosions , originating from progenitors which have experienced strong mass loss ( see vink 2004 , vink 2005 ) , should on average produce more @xmath1ti due to the lower fall back of material on the compact stellar remnant @xcite .",
    "however , there is some debate on the detailed stellar evolution scenario that may have accounted for the low mass of the star prior to the explosion . the amount of oxygen present ( 1 - 2 m@xmath10",
    ", vink 1996 ) suggests a main sequence mass of 20 m@xmath10 .",
    "this may be too low to form a type ib progenitor by mass loss in a wr phase .",
    "moreover , the high surrounding density is better explained if the shock wave is moving through the dense wind of a red supergiant rather than the more tenuous wind of a wr .",
    "therefore , it has been recently suggested that the low mass of the progenitor is the result of a common envelope evolutionary phase in a binary system @xcite .",
    "the authors demonstrated that such a scenario of a 15 - 25 m@xmath10 progenitor which lost its hydrogen envelope due to a binary interaction can match the main observational constraints . in any case , the @xmath1ti production is highly sensitive to details of the explosion as well as nuclear reaction rates .",
    "it is of interest to point out that the major @xmath1ti production reaction @xmath19ca(@xmath20,@xmath2)@xmath1ti has been revised @xcite , implying an increase of the @xmath1ti production by a factor of @xmath16 2 .",
    "in addition to the @xmath1sc @xmath2-ray  lines , the hard x - ray  spectrum is also of interest for its nonthermal continuum emission and because this underlying continuum is critical to properly measure the @xmath1sc line flux . nevertheless , its nature is still under debate .",
    "the nonthermal hard x - ray  continuum could be due to either synchrotron radiation of tev electrons @xcite or nonthermal bremsstrahlung from supra - thermal electrons which have been accelerated by internal shocks ( laming 2001a , b ; vink & laming 2003 ) .",
    "both cases predict a gradual steepening at high energies and then , reliable continuum flux measurements beyond the two low energy @xmath1sc lines ( @xmath21 80  @xmath0 ) are necessary , as initiated with _ cgro_/osse @xcite . soft @xmath2-ray  observations are therefore critical to better understand the nucleosynthesis and the particle acceleration processes in young snrs such as cas  a. ibis  @xcite , one of the two main coded mask aperture instruments onboard the _ integral _  satellite @xcite , is best suited to study both the hard x - ray  continuum and the line emission thanks to its low energy ( 15  @xmath0",
    " 1  @xmath22 ) camera isgri  @xcite .",
    "ibis / isgri  provides spectro - imaging ( 13  fwhm , 6  @xmath0 fwhm at 70  @xmath0 ) over a large field of view ( 400 deg@xmath23 ) in the energy range 15  @xmath0 - 1  @xmath22 with a millicrab sensitivity at 70 kev ( 3 @xmath24 , @xmath25e / e = 2 , 10@xmath26 s ) .",
    "the large field of view allows for long exposures devoted to the simultaneous observation of several sources . in this letter , we report the results of the spectro - imaging analysis of cas  a based on ibis / isgri  observations .",
    "since its launch , _ integral _  has performed deep open time observations dedicated to the cassiopeia region , mainly for measuring and constraining the @xmath1ti production in the cas  a and tycho snrs .",
    "preliminary results on these two young snrs are reported in vink ( 2005 ) and renaud ( 2006 ) , respectively .",
    "moreover , den hartog ( 2006 ) have presented a comprehensive list of the sources detected by ibis / isgri  above 20  @xmath0 in this region .",
    "we have performed a detailed analysis of @xmath16 1800 pointings or science windows ( hereafter , scws ) , each of them lasting typically between 1800 and 3500 s during which the telescopes are pointed at a fixed direction .",
    "we have selected pointings at less than 11  from cas  a and removed those for which the veto and isgri  ( @xmath13 500  @xmath0 ) counting rates were above 3.5 @xmath4 10@xmath27 and 45 ct.s@xmath7 , respectively .",
    "the total effective time is then @xmath16 3.2  @xmath28 ( over @xmath16 4.5  @xmath28 of total exposure time ) .    for @xmath2-ray  line studies , the most critical part of the ibis / isgri",
    "data analysis is the energy correction of detected events .",
    "the spectral performance of the isgri  camera depends on the alignment of the pixel gains and offsets .",
    "based on more than two years of observations , a fine in - flight calibration has been done by taking into account several parameters such as the temperature , the accumulated proton irradiation , and the time after the detector switch - on . moreover , because of the charge loss in the cadmium telluride ( cdte ) detectors and in their electronics , the isgri  spectral response above @xmath16 60  @xmath0 depends on the pulse rise - time and a second software correction is needed @xcite .",
    "background line.[f : isgri_lines ] ]    to evaluate the efficiency of all these corrections , we measured the position and the width of the w k@xmath29 fluorescence background line at 59  @xmath0 for each scw .",
    "as shown in figure [ f : isgri_lines ] , the dispersion of the 59  @xmath0 line position over the 3 years of observations is about 0.1  @xmath0 .",
    "the spectral degradation observed on the right panel of figure [ f : isgri_lines ] is due to the irradiation of the detector pixels but is still negligible after 3 years in terms of line sensitivity ( @xmath16 5% ) .",
    "the deconvolution of coded mask images ( shadowgrams ) removes completely the background only if it is flat .",
    "background structures in the shadowgram produces large scale structures in the deconvolved image . to avoid them",
    ", a background map is first subtracted from the shadowgram .",
    "such correcting background maps were produced by summing a large number of high latitude observations from all directions . in this way , the shadowgrams of the many weak sources are smeared out on the detector . with more than 2  @xmath28 of exposure time ,",
    "these ensure the best removal of structures in the detector images , mainly around the fluorescence lines located close to the two low energy @xmath1sc astrophysical lines .",
    "we then used the off - line scientific analysis ( osa ) software @xcite version 5.1 in order to obtain sky images and we have constructed mosaic images in 14 energy bands ( see figs . [",
    "f : isgri_ima ] and [ f : isgri_spec ] ) .",
    "in order to estimate the source position of the hard x - ray  continuum , we also analyzed the 18 - 25  @xmath0 energy band which has the best signal to noise ratio ( hereafter , s / n ) for a steep spectrum such as that of cas  a. we have fitted the source with a two - dimensional elliptical gaussian with the following parameters : the background level , the position and the value of the maximum , the widths on the two axes , and the rotation angle of the ellipse .",
    "we did not find any evidence of a source extent ( the two widths are close to 14  fwhm ) .",
    "the fitted position of cas  a is r.a .",

    "= + 58  49  02.1  ( j2000 ) with a s / n of @xmath16 38 .",
    "according to gros ( 2003 ) , the corresponding point source location error ( psle ) radius at the 90% confidence level is @xmath16 50 .",
    "therefore , the full error box is contained within the remnant .    .",
    "the count rates and the model have been divided by the effective isgri  area at the center of each channel , in order to obtain approximate flux density units .",
    "the upper limit above 110  @xmath0 is given at the 3 @xmath24 confidence level .",
    "[ f : isgri_spec ] ]    figure [ f : isgri_ima ] shows ibis / isgri  images centered on cas  a in the six energy bands around the two @xmath1sc lines that shows that the source brightens at the line energies . for building up the source spectrum ,",
    "we first measured in each individual sky image the flux and its associated variance at the pixel corresponding to the fitted position in the 18 - 25  @xmath0 energy range .",
    "note that this variance takes into account all uncertainties , in particular those resulting from the background subtraction .",
    "we then calculated the weighted mean count rate and corresponding error for each of the 14 energy bands .",
    "this spectrum is presented in figure [ f : isgri_spec ] , showing the clear detection of the two low energy @xmath1sc lines .",
    "we tested two different models for the continuum emission : the pegged power - law pegpwrlw in the 21 - 120  @xmath0 band and the srcut @xcite model in xspec v.11.3 .",
    "this latter is an approximation of the x - ray  synchrotron radiation from young snrs .",

    "bepposax_/pds @xcite and isgri  , we find a line flux of ( 2.5 @xmath3 0.3 ) @xmath4 10@xmath5 @xmath6 s@xmath7 .",
    "taking into account uncertainties on its age @xcite , distance @xcite and @xmath1ti lifetime @xcite , this is translated into an initial synthesized @xmath1ti mass of ( 1.6@xmath8 ) @xmath4 10@xmath9 m@xmath10 .",
    "this mass of ejected @xmath1ti is generally thought to be unusually large ( or for few specific cases , marginally consistent ) in comparison with spherical explosion models of ww95 and tnh96 @xcite .",
    "moreover , in the standard frame where @xmath1ti and @xmath33ni are co - produced during the first stages of the explosion , cas  a should have been a very bright , @xmath33ni - rich sn , in contrast with its non detection or with the flamsteed s historical record .",
    "however , the large @xmath1ti/@xmath33ni ratio could be explained by the high degree of asymmetries @xcite.the high @xmath1ti yield thus supports the idea that cas  a is the result of an asymmetric and/or a relatively more energetic explosion , consistent with other observational evidence @xcite .",
    "anyway , the @xmath1ti production in core - collapse sne is highly sensitive to the network used to compute nuclear reactions . with the recent revised @xmath19ca(@xmath20,@xmath2)@xmath1ti reaction rate @xcite ,",
    "theoretical models become more compatible with the @xmath1ti yield deduced from ibis / isgri  and previous observations . however , this would make the lack of other galactic @xmath1ti sources an even more serious problem : several @xmath2-ray  line surveys @xcite have highlighted the problem of the `` young , missing , and hidden '' galactic sne , those that should have occurred since cas  a and are still not detected through the line emission from @xmath1ti decay .",
    "this would strengthen the idea that cas  a is peculiar @xcite . on the other hand , the high @xmath1ti yield of both cas  a and sn  1987a @xcite is more in accordance with the solar @xmath1ca/@xmath33fe ratio , whereas this ratio is underpredicted by current spherically symmetric explosive nucleosynthesis models @xcite .    besides the robustness provided by these ibis / isgri  spectro - imaging observations , the main improvements compared to previous observations @xcite are the improved spectral resolution and the improved significance of the detection of the hard x - ray  nonthermal continuum up to 100  @xmath0 well fitted by a single power - law .",
    "the latter gives more stringent constraints on both the line intensities and the underlying continuum .",
    "therefore , the scenario of a synchrotron radiation by tev electrons @xcite as modeled by reynolds & keohane ( 1999 ) seems not appropriate in the case of cas  a. on the other hand , the model developed by laming ( 2001a , b ) implying a nonthermal bremsstrahlung emission of supra - thermal electrons could be an alternative scenario . based on this firm detection of the @xmath1sc lines with ibis / isgri ,",
    "the expected results with spi , thanks to its fine spectral resolution ( @xmath25e @xmath16 2  @xmath0 fwhm at 1  @xmath22 ) , should help us for the first time to constrain the kinematics of the innermost layers of the explosion ( vink 2006 , in preparation ) .",
